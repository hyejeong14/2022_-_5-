1,Naveen Gurazada,5,"The view from the top is amazing. I was excited to be at the top of South Korea's tallest building. The entry to the tower is also an awesome experience, I liked the way they presented its history. Then the lift ride was fascinating with the visuals. At the top here comes the Seoul city view with the Han river. At 550m height, the experience is really worth it. Don't miss it.  For discount book your tickets online in advance.",a week ago
2,Marta Am√©zquita,5,"Very great tourist destination. The view of Seoul it‚Äôs amazing, and in my opinion, the pink hour is the best time to go. The whole going up experience is great. The lift takes 60seconds to go all the way up.  We took the package that offers the observatory ticket price + dinner (you can choose between 5 different dishes) + coffee or tea. So it‚Äôs very worth it.",4 months ago

34,George D,5,"I love this tower. Tallest building in Korea. 6th in the world. I heard there are long lines for observation deck. I had 0 lines and went at about 830 pm on a weekday. It was awesome.

48,Dalton Bruno,5,"Did a walk'in. Wasn't sure where to go, to start the ticketing as there was a small crowd. But once we figured it out, the process was great. The pricing was reasonable.  It starts with the usual lower level museum/entertainment section. Then there is a elevator ride up with some cool history.  Up at the top there's so many ways to experience the views and heights. Everything was clean and easy to find. There's areas to eat, a gift shop, a bar etc. It's a fully packed expensive will do it for a 3rd time.",2 months ago
49,Austin Lee,5,"It's more than just a tower observation deck. If you get a combo package with the aquarium, it is definitely worth visiting on a sunny day. At the top, there are 4 floors with different things to see, including a glass section with nothing down to the ground. They also have digital panels that show you what you are looking at through the windows, as well as historical photos of those areas. The topmost fifth (122nd) floor has a restaurant you need a reservation for. There is also a rope bridge experience with a safety harness above the tower, for an extra fee.",a year ago
50,Benjamin Sung,1,"It was our fault that we visited on a school holiday, ""World School Festival"" or something like that. The entire park was overrun by middle and high school students, all still in their school uniforms, when we arrived after lunch. The lines for every attraction were hours long; the combined noise from the parade on the main level and the crowds was deafening; and the whole faculty was simply not navigable. On top of that, the magic pass we paid for with our tickets had some kind of glitch that caused it to fail on our phone, so we never even got into a line. After fiddling with the phone for half an hour while trying to avoid being stampeded by hormone driven high schoolers, we gave up and went to see if we could get a refund on our tickets. The ""information desk"" was a kiosk with a couple of tablets, with no staff person in sight. We fought our way through the crowd along the full length of the main floor twice looking for someone, anyone to help us; finally found a guy who showed us to a door hidden behind one of the walls of the park. By this time our 9-year- old was quietly sobbing into my arms, and I think that persuaded the clerk to grant us the refund, which he said was not normal policy. Even then, to get the refund, we had to make our way back through the crowd out to the ticket counter at the front gates, where they redirected us to the turnstiles, where they redirected us back to the ticket counter. Where they finally gave us the refund after figuring out that our magic pass had malfunctioned. But for me, even without the absurd crowd, not worth the money or time - there's so many better things to do in Seoul, and better amusement parks elsewhere if that's your thing.",a month ago

Once paid, you can expect a long entrance inside and feels like it was done on purpose to keep building excitement. You eventually reach the elevator and takes less than 2 minutes to reach the very top, which is impressive. But be ready to want to yawn to get the pressure off your ears. Once at the top, you will come across some restaurants, shops, and you will be able to take photos with a glass floor, you will be able to step outside briefly, and have a walk around. You will also be watching a video presentation before hand that turns the screen off to reveal the outside to you. Overall, a great experience and worth the money.",3 years ago

I like my personal space, but different cultures have different practices.  They do that in some high end stores in the USA too though, so just think of the following store clerks as your personal staff.

66,Jimmy Zuehl,5,"Pretty cool. A bit of a long process to get to the top, but once there, the view is spectacular. Paid extra to visit the lounge, which includes a drink. Was worth it, as the lounge was practically empty, compared to the busy observation decks below. Don't bother trying to get a picture at the first level. It's the busiest level. Each level tends to get less and less busy, yet  the view gets better and better the higher you go.",2 years ago

There is so much to see and do that you can't possibly take cover it all in one day (I will review the mall separately as well as the restaurants we ate at while here).  Our main goal when visiting Lotte World Tower was to visit the observation deck on floors 117-120.  The trip up is on a state of the art elevator where you feel immersed in the LED screens lighting up around you.  Once at the 117th floor you can take in incredible views of Seoul and the surrounding landscapes as you work your way up the 120th floor.  Be sure to check out the outside deck as you take in the views and walk on the glass floor looking straight down if you dare!,2 years ago

You wait in a line to have them tell you to get in another line which then separates you into two lines, but that's just me being picky. There's 6 stories at the top with different features.

First, it's a very similar experience to Namsan Tower (AKA Seoul N Tower). In fact, in many aspects it felt like a copy-and-paste experience. It's way too similar and it felt like they were too lazy and unoriginal with the design.  It was also odd the top floor had escalators going up, but not down. You have to go out and take the building stairs and come back in.  Second, other than the fantastic view, there isn't much else to do. If you're already been to Namsan Tower, don't expect too much. It will feel like a very familiar experience.",10 months ago

The sheer experience of standing on the glass floor gives u an Adrenalin rush. Make sure u don‚Äôt miss visiting the top floor of the tower. Elevators are super fast and within just a few seconds you will be on top. They also have a souvenir shop (which is a bit expensive) on top. Do not miss having an ice cream from the cafe.

The elevator takes you up pretty fast. The observation deck stretches over multiple floors and the views are stunning. They offer to take your pics professionally and there is also a well sorted souvenir store. If you feel like having a coffee, there is a Angel in us coffee shop too.

The service by the staff was excellent but just watch the locals they always try and push in.  Our experience was fantastic. There's a snack, ice cream and candy bar at the top.  You can go outside on the viewing deck. A MUST DO.  And it's free.  The souvenir shop at the top is very good.  When you are finished and are leaving they funnel you through a final gift shop incase you want to buy more.  The lift is so fast you hardly fee you are going up.  The only clue is that you have to equal the pressure. Your ears. ****** Take alot of pictures while you are up there********  there is also an area to get the photo at the top professionally done.

It contains sky ride, i.e visit to observatory at 123rd floor, there is a big mall in the same building, which is connected to a big aquarium and the lotte adventure park or u may call it a theme park. The tower visit is very nice, at times it gets crowdy and lines at the elevators get a bit long. The elevator leaves u at floor 118. From there on you can go to floor 122 by escalators. Finally for floor 123 u need to climb stairs. Thats the highest point u can go  in this building. Floor 121, 122, 123 have excellent panoramic view of the city. Its amazing and beautiful view from here. There are souvenirs shops and few eating options also available on the top floors. Most exciting is the portion with glass or transparent floor, its good place for lil bit thrill and taking photos. If you have to make a choice between N Seoul Tower and Lotte world tower for climbing up, please go for lotte world tower, its much more exciting, though N Seoul Tower is also a must visit place, but if u have lotte world in your program then you may not climb up on N Seoul Tower.

167,Sourav Bindal,5,"Design  In 1989, the first design was made and there was a plan. Design changed again in 1994, 1995 and 1997. The design that came out of the second Lotte World in 2002 was similar to that of France, which literally copied the Eiffel Tower. Following the revision of the bird's eye view from 2004 to 2006, the bird's eye view was changed seven times in 2008 and the design was changed in 2009 and the Lotte World Tower began to break ground[6].  The Shard of England is said to be similar in design. The Shard, the design of renowned Italian architect Renzo Piano, was launched in 2008 and completed in 2012 and opened in 2013. Its interior and elevator atmosphere are similar. In addition, space externally on the roof tower is similar.  Height  On March 17, 2016, prior to the final phase of external construction, the Diagrid lantern-shaped roof structure was completed. The roof structure was constructed with steel counterparts that are each 12 meters and weigh 20 tons. The counterparts were made up of bent metal panels that are 6 cm thick, and the structure itself is 120 meters high, and it covers floors 107‚Äì123. Approximately 3,000 tons of steel parts, a high-precision 64t tower crane, high-precision GPS alignment systems and highly skilled welding technicians were used in the construction of the roof itself. The roof structure is engineered to withstand its weight without reinforcing pillars, and endure earthquakes up to a magnitude of 9 under the Richter magnitude scale and winds up to 80 m/s.[7]  CharacteristicsEdit  Landmark  Lotte World Tower is a landmark in Seoul. It is the first 100-story building in Korea. As of its completion, it was the second-highest tower in the world, following the Shanghai Tower (located 546 meters high and 118 stories) in Shanghai, China, and the highest in the OECD countries. The conceptual design calls for a slender cone with convex, gently curved sides. An exterior of pale-coloured glass draws inspiration from Korean ceramics and features accents of metal filigree.[8]  Floor plans  Main facilities  Seoul Sky is located on the 117th - 123rd floors of Lotte World Tower in Sincheon-dong, Songpa-gu, Seoul, Korea. The 117th floor is the entrance floor and the view floor; the 118th floor has the Sky Friendly Cafe and Sky Terrace; the Photozone on the 119th floor; Seoul Sky Cafe on the 122nd floor; 123 lounge, which is a premium lounge bar, is on the 123rd floor. There are four media stands on the 117th and 118th floors. The view floor has prominent views of the city, as well as a glass floor and a telescope. The sky skylight of Seoul Sky was the highest glass floor observatory as of the tower's completion. Lotte Tower and One World Trade Center have concluded an operation and technical service agreement.[9][10]",2 years ago

To top it off, the view was really amazing.Service was also so nice. They made sure my coffee was constantly full, and the manager, who seemed French, was so kind and would just strike a conversation with me, perhaps noticing that I was alone.

500,John White,3,"The view from the tower is nice, being that the smog is not too bad. I visited on Dec 25. There was a lot of smog, but the interesting thing is that we were above the smog, so you could see the smog belt from above. The top of the mountains in the distance were clear, as they were also above the smog. The glass floor was interesting. Since I visited on Christmas, it may have been busier than usual. The bad things are the price, which is about $27 US, and the airport security before you can go up. You have to empty your pockets, take off your belt, etc, just like the airport, and then go through a metal detector. A pain just to visit an observatory. Lot's of tactically dressed security personnel are at every stair level. Not friendly looking. Anyway, there is a nice coffee shop at 500 meters, and a small cramped open air area that is manned by yet another security personnel, limiting the number of people going in before others come out because the area is so small. The wait for the exit elevator to go back down was about 20 minutes.Still, a landmark worth a visit to say that you have been there.",2 years ago
