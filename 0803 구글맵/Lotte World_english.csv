Ambience and atmosphere was magical with plenty of locals renting high school uniforms to dress up and take pictures - we joined in this experience too!  If you are looking for more thrilling rides would recommend Everland instead. Lotte World gives a more holistic family approach. Could easily spend a whole day here with the number of rides available. I used the Seoul Discovery Pass for this, be sure to note that redemption is at a separate booth.",2 months ago

2,Max Lee (Zedomax),5,"Lotte world theme park, Korea's first ever theme park that opened in 1989, I have been going here since it opened.  They have giant indoor theme park which is nice for hot summers and cold winters plus outdoor area called magic island also.",a week ago

4,B J,4,"This is a 3.5 to 4 star experience. This is actually one of the few indoor things you can do in Seoul all day during the brutal summer weather. The place is massive there's a lot of things to do. Many many rides and activities. There's a very large cultural museum that will take a few hours just by itself. I give it lower stars because the more serious rides are mediocre at best and has longer lines than anywhere I have ever been to before. About 2.5 hours of wait time for example for the most popular ride. Here's a tip for foreigners. Websites likes viator and trazy offer substantial discount for foreigners (as of July 2022) if they show their passports at the entrance. It's about 35% discount on average. You do have to book a day ahead for it though not the day of. But if you are getting this discount then consider buying their Magic Pass which will make you skip lines at most of the rides except the super popular ones I believe. I wasn't able to get the discount cause of time constraints but if I had to redo, and had time, I'd get the discount with the magic pass, which night have made the overall experience far more pleasant.",3 weeks ago
5,Mohammed Y (‚Ä´ÿ®Ÿà ÿ¨ÿßÿ≥ŸÖ‚Ä¨),5,Very nice place. And you will have fun while you be there with your friends or family. But the only disadvantage is that you need to wait 30-60 minutes to play every game,4 weeks ago

10,Paul Rydell,4,Pre-purchased tickets for foreigners that included 5 magic-passes. Took about 10 minutes to get in at opening.  Don't bother with the magic passes on the app. If you pre-purchased magic passes they are actually on your ticket. We had the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 printed on the tickets. Just go to the front of the line to the magic pass area and hand your ticket over and they will circle one of the numbers and let you in. The lines were 90-120 minutes for the more popular rides on a Friday in late July 2022. So the extra fee for magic passes was definitely worth it.  There are tons of great food options and the prices for food and snacks were very reasonable. Especially compared to US theme park standards.,3 weeks ago

25,R√°Jess,5,It is the only amusement park in Seoul. It is located near the Lotte World Tower. It is like the Disneyland of Seoul. There are so many things to see and try inside the park.

29,Kris Fedorak,4,Went on a weekday 10:30-4:00 while local kids were in school. Despite this there were lots of high schoolers around. Seemed not very busy in the main halls but there were still significant lines at most rides (30+ min). The roller coaster had a 2 hour line around 1 pm. Lines were shorter outside as it was sunny. Lots of great amusement park rides and variety - some for the more adventurous with iron stomachs and others that are tame and better for little kids. Food options are not great.,a month ago
30,Alexander Bont,5,Lots of fun for the whole family. It has a lot of indoor attractions so even if it's raining you can still go here. If you don't like waiting in lines consider purchasing the magic pass which allows you to bypass the lines.,3 weeks ago

I'm really sad I couldn't go to many outside rides as they were closed due to the rain but I did go on the comet express and although I did get soaked, it was so so worth it! Definitely my favorite ride there! It was weird though because for my ride for The adventures of Sinbad, my ride stopped multiple times throughout. The staff apologized and we got through safely(it's not a dangerous ride, you mostly just flow through the river seeing the props). Still, it was kind of weird. The viking was fun and went extremely high but the line was so long for an experience that lasted 2 minutes max.  Still, it was a really fun experience and I highly recommend going when it's not raining!",3 weeks ago

40,Melody GH,3,"Probably I should once again clarify that this is post pandemic which seems to have changed a lot how things work. On top of that, we should be fair and mention that despite being a work day, it was already school break. We arrived at 9 am, and after eating something, looking around, getting familiar ...we began our odyssey to get a magic pass for, at some point, almost any attraction. Spoiler: didn't work. So please do not rely on magic passes. It worked before pandemic, today did not work at all. We queued for 3 hours to join  the first attraction (yeeeah!) No need to say that this drained our energy  quite a lot. Later we queued for an hour and later on for another 45 min. 2 hours for Atlantis (not fun at all if sun is shining and it looks more like a perfect day for beach. So, my recommendation to you all: avoid summer break period, do not rely on getting a magic pass, and save some money to get the ticket which allows you to ride 5 times any one without queuing (costs 49000 won) p/person. On the positive side, employees are always kind and helpful, it could get difficult with English speaking. Food is a little bit expensive but ok. So, overall is a good attraction.",a week ago

The wait for popular ride was about 45-60m (without priority pass).  Souvenirs and food inside the park wasn‚Äôt as diverse as expected.

59,Zhanel M.,5,"Highly recommend buying tickets online as they are cheaper. All day pass tickets allow you to ride almost all attractions for free and there is no limit. We spent all day at the park starting from magic land outside. It looks like a fairy tale city with a castle and the bridge. The queue was not very long on a weekday. Don‚Äôt forget to take the map at the entrance as it will be easy to navigate. There are attractions and cafes, snack bars at all floors so you will never get bored hungry. I highly recommend the Milk bar with delicious ice cream and Gong cha for drinks. Bottle of water is expensive so look for water fountains to refill your bottle.

It‚Äôs super interesting and fun to see Korea‚Äôs take on an amusement park.  Some rides feel familiar to those in the U.S. (like the pirate ship and log flume) but others are different, like those with a 3D or VR component.  The indoor section is huge and amazing, with multiple levels with different attractions.  The monorail or balloon ride are good ways to get a bird‚Äôs eye view of the attractions.  There is an ice rink in the basement where we watched children learning tricks and speed skating.  Outdoors, the rides are a bit more action-packed and several give great views of the surrounding city and the Lotte Tower, Seoul‚Äôs tallest building.  Highly recommend this park as a visitor to Seoul, if you have the time!",3 years ago

If the monorail is working, I would take that instead.",4 years ago
74,Simone Collins,3,"While I am SUPER glad we went to Lotte World to experience it, it left us feeling rather depressed and disturbed, as though we had just awoken from a bad dream. The indoor park and its adjacent outdoor park are impressive, especially given that they're in the middle of a city, but they also feel like a run down, dystopian Disney knock off that has not seen much in the way of updates in the past 20 years. The characters wore worn costumes and equally worn, forced smiles.  All that said, the kids at the park seemed to be having a blast--more with photo and selfie opportunities (often facilitated by special stations and costume places) than the rides. They don't seem to be bothered at all by the strange, creepy undertones of the park.",3 years ago

SOUTH GATE only entrance for foreign. I suggest don't come here during school holiday because lots of highschoolers come for vocation here by bus loads! 2-3hours waiting time for the rides. If you can only come during school holiday time (Dec-Feb) I suggested you get yourself a magicpass (for fast/express lane but you have to double check sometime even the ride is open but the magicpass lane is close; only some hours, not the whole day). Even if you don't want to pay extra for the magicpass which there is 2options; 5magicfor50,000 or unlimited for 100,000 extra) The unlimited(not magicpass; with some obvious other items not included like the coin game machines and etc fews) all day pass is around 57,000. Come noon onwards no point to come early as less people when it is closing time. Watch the free shows & parades. There are great shows and parades! At the end of the day you can go though most VR rides very quickly; about less than 30mins queuing and almost instant with the magicpass.

82,Min Ah Kim,4,We definitely enjoyed our visit here. If you are like us who are not thrill seekers no worries you can still have some fun indoors. I think having both indoors and outdoors is a plus for Lotte World. And additional attraction is the Koren Folk Museum which is a perfect place to revive Korean history.,4 years ago
83,Bo Z,5,"Get there very early before the gates open.  At least an hour. (at least 1.5 hours) just to be sure. (bring snacks to eat while you are waiting). If you have kids there are plenty of rides. Older kids there are even more attractions. TGI Friday's is a good place to eat at fast service on our day. At Christmas time we saw Santa,  marching band and dancers. The gift store is a must visit. If you have a young daughter there's a princess make up area.  The whole area was very clean and the staff were always very helpful. We will be back again.",2 years ago

Buy tickets online is cheaper 35,000won vs door price 57,000 won (check again, it may have changed)  If you like being indoors, this is the SmaLL  place for you. (4 floors of it.)  Except for one section which is outdoors (Bungee drop etc), but they offer no service because there was some rain today.  This park is quick access within city of Seoul. Good for young kids. The other theme park is better, although further out beyond city.  The air conditioning could be cooler, considering we are indoors. Felt stuffy , as we are indoors with long queues.  Pharaohs Fury (motion ride) was elaborate, impressed.  Coin slot machines- some just won't work after you put in your coins. No assistance nor staff to aid or claim.",3 years ago
86,Anna N.,4,"My first time at this park was quite funny. It‚Äôs a really big indoor park with a lot of attraction.  Overall it was ok but unfortunately so crowded (although it was on a weekday), there were so many students and people that i could only ride few attractions.  Since i did not know to go directly to the outside park (magic island) at the beginning, I was not able to enjoy any attraction outside. Therefore, I would recommend to go to the attractions first and then enjoy the indoor park.  The park is quite huge and has many levels with places to eat. Like other amusement parks, they also have music schedules and performances in the park to enjoy.  Some rides were not foc- you have to pay around 5000krw like haunted house.  Others are free.  Lotte world is really a huge indoor park and has a lot to see.  But unfortunately, many schools are going there on weekdays and on weekend there are a lot of tourists. Therefore, you have to be very patient if you want to try every ride.",3 years ago

I downloaded the Magic Pass ride to skip lining up but it's only available in some rides or it is booked early. The food inside was quite reasonable too.

There is a huge rush usualy, and  there are long ques for every swing. We most of the time is wasted in ques. And its impossible to enjoy evety ride and adventures in single visit. Minimum a whole day from early morning to late night is good for visiting this place. There are so many option to get amused by. Sky baloons ride, bumbercars, rollar coasters, live music and other events everyday. There are also many swings and entertainment for young kids too.. many adventures such as  jungle adventure, across the dark, magic island, are very good for kids. This a smalll world of entertainment for kids and adults too. Ticket price is high. But there are many discount passes available for students, young kids and according to time of visit. It is a good place to visit for tourists in seoul. As all the entrrtainment and fun van be enjoyed here. This place can be rated 4 stars. 1 star is less because there are long quues for everything and that wastesost of the time of visit. Best way to enjoy everything is to take a map and make a plan of what you are going to enjoy first and second and so on to save time and energy. Otherwise one just get lost in here.",3 years ago
97,Chris K,5,"Definitely worth a trip if you're in/around Seoul and want to go to an amusement park.  It's indoors (with some outdoor attractions), and it's easy to spend an entire day indoors and still want to come back: That means it's great to go here even if it's raining!  The rides were fun, though the lines were pretty long.  You have to check up on the rides you want to go on to find the best time to go.  Usual waits are under an hour, shorter for some rides.  The food is fun (but not very Korean), and the atmosphere is great.  The park is very clean and tidy.  BUT DON'T GO ON THE BALLOON RIDE UNLESS THE WAIT TIME IS UNDER 20 MINUTES.  The wait was longer than it was estimated, and the views were not spectacular.  But when you get in the 30 minute-range of the front of the line, they have a series of speakers set up so you can hear the staff giving their scripted hellos and goodbyes to each passenger.  I don't know why they thought it would be a good idea to make riders listen to this.  It was especially bad because the woman doing it had a very annoying voice, so hearing her say the same two phrases over and over almost drove me insane.  But I don't blame her -- she probably hates saying it more than I hated hearing it.  Everything other than the balloon ride was phenomenal though!",2 years ago

187,Darwin Scott,4,"Can be Fun but overcrowded, expect to wait. I came here on a Monday on a field trip with my university. Among us was apparently 3 other high schools. It took over 3 hours to ride popular big rides like the french revolution. Other than that it was quite good, highly reccomend going for shorter lined rides if its crowded such as the hot air balloon, bumper cars, haunted house, flying machine, watch the live show, or zombies (halloween event). In total it was worth the price i paid about 25,000won if you go to the south gate and buy a foreigner only ticket at a office there. Otherwise the regular price of 60,000won or more isnt worth it as it's basically a discount Disneyland with 3 hour wait times and characters nobody knows. And dont get me started on that some rides require even more money to enter like the haunted house!! Total cash grab!! Please do your due deligence for tickets, and dont expect too much if you've experienced other theme parks. Somes rides lack the real magic ( adventure of sinbad) of others, and can be downright dissapointing if you wait that long, but if you have a spare day and some fun friends it can definetly be a good time, go check it out!",3 years ago

296,Rodney Bates,5,This place was really fun. Nice food courts and tons of shopping. Only downer was that you had to sign up on iPads for waiting list some where as long as 6 hours to even go shop in a store..  I did go up in the tower it was outstanding. Being able to walk out on glass floors and look down was quite amazing.,a year ago
297,Miyuki U,5,"Went with my 5.5 month old and she enjoyed it. There was a nursing/changing station which was was very clean and not busy. Do understand though that babies won't get to do much so if you go with an infant or 1-4 y/o it will be more for the shows which are every other hour.  We went on a Saturday so of course it was busy but nothing like ""Disneyland busy"". Which is nice because we could see everything. Food prices won't cost you an arm and a leg which is a plus and there were sitting areas. Right now it's spring but almost summer so the adventure half of the park will be hot and filled with older kids to adults as that's where the amusement park rides are.  Overall I would go again!",a year ago

Some of the rides, like the FlyVenture need some repairs, as the screen has some cracks which nullify the special effects of the ride. Still, my son loves that ride, even though it also no longer sprays a water mist as one of the special effects of the ride.  It also seems like they are closing the rides about 30 minutes earlier than they had been closing them before. On one small curious and disappointing note, the KFC (my kids favorite) does not serve the original recipe chicken ~ only the spicy extra crispy, which for kids is a dealbreaker.  Nevertheless, Quiznos Sandwiches provided a wonderful meal (and much healthier too, which makes Mommy happy!!).  All in all, I would give this visit to Lotte World a (""B -"").   It was above average and everyone had a nice day, but some of the ""Wow-factor"" seemed to be missing, even though our kids didn't seem to notice that.",8 months ago

Just going around the area for sightseeing was already mesmerizing for the first timer like me. :) We also went to the outdoor rides and tried several of them. There we saw the tallest tower in South Korea, the Lotte Tower. If you want to visit this place, make sure to allot one day for you to fully enjoy your visit. Also, make sure to stay in the evening to see the place transforms into a magical park with lights shimmering to all direction. Don't forget to take a photo with the Lotte tower. :) Enjoy your trip and be safe. :)",2 years ago

Arcade was pretty shady, the toy crane game grip was so weak, i dont think anyone ever won a toy. Food choices are pretty similar throughout the park. If you are military (US or ROK) you get a discount, which is great if you have a lot of kiddos in tow. Elevators throughtout the park is plentiful so strollers are def recommended.

Great time for the children with lots for them to do (ages 5, 3, 10 months.) Great rides they loved and a fun parade etc.  Some staff not very enthusiastic and seemed to be just putting in their time while others were great. One concern was one of the ride workers checking her hair in her phone while securing the kids to the moon/Sun ride. Way to many staff had their phones out and weren't paying attention.

I think that ride is the best but sadly it was closed down when we got there ‚òπÔ∏è. The outside area is pretty small and the good rides are all 60 mins or more wait time.

438,Melih Ergundogdu,4,"Go there on weekdays if you can. Weekends you need to wait 1 hour 30 minutes for a 5 minutes ride. It's the biggest indoor theme park, the machines are somehow old but still enjoyable. Don't forget visiting the outside part and lower floors as well.",4 years ago
439,Jon Bach,1,"Absolutely hated it, 6 hours and I only got to ride 4 attractions. Not worth it unless you get the pass to skip the lines. Lines have ridiculous wait times, expect most to be 45-70 minutes long, or more. They also don't tell you that many of the attractions also require an additional fee to ride. Many good rides we're also under construction during my trip. Weather conditions also affect which rides are open, but they won't tell you.",3 years ago

444,Soomin Park,4,"Great collection of entertainment with some impressive rides. It was very crowded even on Monday, and air conditioning didn't work well. The waiting line was 60-110 min until 6pm, got much shorter near the end of the park. French Revolution was the best ride in the park. Still very fun place to visit and lots of other things to enjoy in Lotte World and Lotte World Tower.",3 years ago
445,M Carter,5,The kids love it actually. It is a fun place to create memories with family. Waiting times can be long. Pick your day wisely especially if you have young kids - and get there early. The indoor balloon ride is very popular so do it as early as possible because it just gets busier and busier as the day goes on.,5 years ago
446,acar ahmet,1,First of all it's crowded. it is not worth to go there spend money and time to get what total 10 to 20 minutes rides or activities. staffs are rude and there is no proper information desk. it was quite difficult for me as a first time visitor to figure out how things work. you can make 3 reservations for magic pass but all the popular rides are already booked ^^ it was the worst amusement park experience in my life. i will probably never put my step there again.,2 years ago
447,Susan Phillip,4,"Very modern park, ice rink is superb.  Lots of reasonably priced food and drink outlets. Queues were very very long though. We averaged one ride about every 45 mins. Even so teenage daughter loved it, especially Atlantis, french Revolution and gyro drop.",2 years ago
448,Ruptanu Barua,5,It is wonderful. Variety of rides and exciting events are available to enjoy. I personally visited in the year 2015 from Bangladesh.

Those who visit SEOUL he should  visit at least one time.,2 years ago

460,Reno Cheong,4,"As close to a Disneyland experience you can get that's absent in South Korea! Actually fun to experience a indoor theme park, quite conceptually amazing. Please be warned, it has the same long queue times as any world class theme park you can find anywhere in the world; that is most rides expect minimum 1 hour wait, from roller coasters to the simple carousel. If you can, spend more on fast past to jump queues do so, they sell out quickly early. Time is money and you want to experience much you can here. English communication easy",2 years ago
461,X L,1,"Avoid at all cost. The queue line are always unbearably long cattle pen in a mass of excited kids. Any time, any day. It'd be fine if they did their best to reduce them but this park has reached a new level of not giving a dam. The boat ride goes half empty. They run their roller coasters with one single train while there is a 110 min wait! And the operators don't care, chitchatting. There is no single rider to reduce the queue line. It's ridiculous. And if the dark rides are OK, the other rides and the roller coasters are not even that good and they are old ,unlike Everland's wooden. Just buy some sandwich, take your kids to the forest, and you'll have a way better time than in this dump.",3 years ago

Spent a extra 40,000won per person to get the magic pass with how crowded it was but there wasn't that much ride. Certain attractions didn't let you use the magic pass (don't know why I pay for it at this point) and the wait was over 2.5 hours so I didn't even bother. Also more than 5 rides/attractions was close or not operating so I felt like I got cheated and didn't get my money's worth for the trip.",2 years ago
466,Lianne,4,"Better to come early to make the most of the fun rides. Unfortunately, it rained when we visited so most of the outdoor rides such as Gyro Spin, Gyro Drop, etc. were closed. Also, download their app 'Magic Pass' to see the status of the rides, maps, etc.",2 years ago
467,Darren Goodair,3,"Over half of the big/adult rides were closed for maintenance. Can they really not figure out how to schedule maintenance appropriately to only close 1 or 2 big rides at a time? The pizza restaurant was a Dominos that charges $40 per pizza and has the audacity to chase you down to clean up your own table after paying that ridiculous premium price. I recommend only going if you verify what rides are open on the day, and in that case the park is excellent with really outstanding quality.",3 years ago
