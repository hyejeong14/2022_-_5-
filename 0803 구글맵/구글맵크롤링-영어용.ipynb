It takes a while to get to the top, the elevator, than the cable car, than some stairs, and than the lift, so plan your time. Try and get to the top at sunset. It amazing!! The night view is also spectacular, so don't miss it. Just make sure the weather is clear. The place is very well organized, and even though there are many people here, everything is running smoothly.\", \"Good place to have a look at Seoul's skyline. The entry ticket is reasonably cheap but there isn't too much to do at the observation deck. Unfortunately, the windows were quite dirty and some views/photos weren't as good as they should have. Definitely come at sunset to enjoy both day and night views of the city. The park around the tower is also super nice and worth exploring. There are good opportunities to take photos of the skyline in the park itself if you want to save some money.\", 'Nice attraction. Low price as well so took the cable car up and walked down. Would not suggest walking up the stairs. Went up around 1830 so i could see both day and night sites. Really cloudy today so the range is limited. it gets busy and crowded up there at dark. Got better photos after i went back down to the entrance. there was a lot of glare on the windows up top once the sun set. Did not eat at the French restaurant up at the top.', \"Awesome to see Seoul from the tower! We didn't pay to go up to the top, but still got quite the view from the free areas. This is really accessible with the shuttle buses, so do visit here! Be sure to catch the cultural performance in the afternoon--cool stuff with swords and all.\", \"It just does not get better than this tower in the springtime. The weather is nice, and the trees are lovely. If you don't want to take a bus to the plaza, there are many little trails to walk on.  Lots of food options, picture spots, and a magnificent 360 view of the city. If you have not come here yet, please do so.  The only downside I can think of is that it will be crowded.\", 'Great place to visit and one of the iconic places of Seoul. I recommend taking the cable car up to the top of the mountain as it is quick and offers nice views of the city. \\\\once at the top there are panoramic views of the city and it is a lovely place to watch the world go by.', \"A one time place to visit if you are in Seoul. We went on Sunday. It is situated on the mountain and there are two ways to reach up there, either you can take a cable car or you can hike. We chose the second option. It's a steep hike of about 2Km. Bring energy drink with you as you are going to sweat a lot. You can get the view of entire city from the top. It's a good place to visit with your friends once on a weekend. Book ticket online on waug for a discount on ticket.\", 'I hiked up to the tower from a few miles away with a backpack on—the hike is paved and has steps, but it’s *a lot* of steps. I was pretty sweaty and winded by the time I made it to the tower.  The view from the lower observation areas is spectacular, honestly even better than the view from the tower itself. This is primarily because people smudge the windows inside the tower, and there are so many kids buying souvenirs and candy up there.  That said, going up is kind of fun and they make it into a bit of an experience, with an interesting interactive video projection/art room and some cool videos in the elevator. There’s also a really nice restaurant inside the tower if you’re interested in impressing a date.  Definitely worthwhile. I’d recommend hiking up! It’s a nice area to walk and you can find other nice lookout areas along the way!', 'Great spot to look down the Seoul from here. Visiting in evening is a good choice for you to enjoy the daytime view and the night view. Take cable car to the peak, and have a cup of coffee while waiting for the sunset. Then you can enjoy the breathtaking view of Seoul.', \"Definitely an experience worth doing.  I hiked from the base of the mountain, all the way up to the tower then went up to the observation decks.  Very beautiful scenery, Seoul is a beautiful city and this is definitely one way to see it from a high viewpoint  Try to make it up there just before sunset.  It's breathtaking.\", \"I have been here a few time over the span of five years. Over time the locks outside have gotten disgusting. I can't remember if the light room was always there, but it's a nice addition either way. The periscopes are amazing. The coin machines seem to always be empty or put of service.\", \"N. Seoul Tower was extremely beautiful and there was a lot to see. Almost all of the stores were closed so we couldn't find bottled water anywhere until we got back down off the mountain. Other than that it was a lot of fun.\", 'Gorgeous place to go on an outing. N Seoul Tower is also quite famous for their \"love lockers,\" in which couples take locks with their initials and store them anywhere in the area. It\\'s a little lonely when you\\'re quite single, but the sights are outrageously gorgeous. I took the scenic route by walking the whole 2.3km up, and ended up with very nice views of Seoul. Highly recommended! In addition to the pavillion, the Namsan Tower houses 7 floors with different shops, a game arcade and even photo booths!', 'The next point of the expedition has been checked. We left a padlock with names and drank a coffee with a nice view. I don’t know if we can rest here, but I’m sure we can drink good coffee. The place also has attractions for children (adults will also use these attractions)', 'A great excursion on a weekday when it was not crowded (can imagine to go here on weekend can be hard work....). We didnt have to wait anything and boarded the cable car right away. Same thing with the elevator to the observation deck in the tower, which made this experience a nice one. Many places at the top to sit and relax and enjoy the views. Provides great views of this great city. I recommend this site but do it on a weekday to beat the crowds.', 'Excellent tower and decent experience. There are very nice views at the top that can you enjoy. The problem is that it got really crowded on top with hundreds of students shouting. Perhaps the number of people who can enter can be restricted.', \"Been here a bunch of times and it's one of my favorite places in Seoul, but I had never been at night until this last trip, and let me say, it's way better! Beautiful view of the city and a cooler walk to the top. Be ready to climb some stairs.\", 'We went there on sundays. All folks of life was there including grandma with 2 sticks going up from below to the top. Our journey From DDP riding train n walk for 15min up to hill to ride cable car. Going back we just walking down the hill until we reached the bus to town. Its tiring but with those breathtaking views, its worth the sweat!', 'must visit when in Seoul!  It’s a moderate trek up to the tower( 13000₩ 2way cable car also available). Views are excellent and the shop at the observatory sells some nice souvenirs', 'We walked here from our hotel in Myeongdong. The prices were pretty normal and we enjoyed the sights a lot! You can walk a path to the tower or take the gondola for a small fee. Then the tower itself has a fee to the top. At the top platform after the cable car you have a cafe, souvenirs shop, pagoda, and a nice view. Once in the tower, it gives an amazing 360 degree view of Seoul. There’s a cute candy store at the top for kids and a souvenirs shop with postcards and magnets, shirts, etc. They have various packages too where you can get two tickets into the tower+2 beers or sodas+ a love lock for $36,000 krw. You will need to make a reservation for this. We went around 4:30 and it was busy but not too bad. On our way down there we’re tons of people heading up for sunset- which is a very busy and crowded time so try and avoid that if you don’t want crowds.', 'Piece and wonderful place. In contact with nature you can feel fresh air to the top of the mountain. Foreigners can get some reduction on ticket price if the they want to get to top of Tower....', 'Solid hike to the top. Didn’t pay to go up the tower or use the cable car. If your into a bit of exercise close to the myeongdong area this is worth a look. And when the sky is clear it’s beautiful', 'Was a short hike and very beautiful. The busing required instead of any other entries was different for visitors. Glad we had a local, that knew how to get into here! The love locks are cool and they had music and dancers, too.', 'Always love going up to the top of the tower and seeing a 360 view of the city! If you walk up there are lots of stairs, but the bus or cable car is also available. Day and night have a different feel so if you could try to go a both times.', \"It's like heaven ❤️ Awesome feeling when you are in observation deck. I am from India and I am pursuing my PhD in Hanyang University, South Korea. I Love South Korea with all by my Heart ❤️ I Love Seoul ❤️\", \"Amazing views. No need to go past observation deck. Buy a lock and share your love, it's kitschy but fun!\", \"Can't explain in words the beauty of Namsan Tower ❤️ it's awesome. Simply Awesome. I am a PhD Research Scholar in Hanyang University, South Korea. I Love South Korea all by my heart ❤️ I love Seoul and people of Korea. They are very Kind and Generous ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I Love Korea 🇰🇷\", 'The tower is on the peak place in the city. One can get by city bus or cable car. Wonderful sight seeing of the entire Seoul city. Must visit place if your in Seoul.', 'I\\'ll update this post after a second visit where I actually climb the tower. However this place gives you a breathtaking bird\\'s eye view of Seoul and I\\'ve attached a photo evidence. It\\'s also an amazing place for walks. Of course lovebirds put \"love padlocks\" of their love around the tower\\'s railing here.', 'The Seoul Tower measures approximately 235 m tall.  Construction started in 1969 and made its debut in 1980. The tower has become an iconic landmark and is now considered the definition of Seoul.  It is the second highest point and is used as a communications tower and observatory. Being perched on top of Namsan Mountain, and in addition to its height, it provides a spectacular 360 degree views of the cityscape.  Seoul Tower is surrounded by attractions, restaurants, and other landmarks. The tower’s exterior lighting change color and has a restaurant with a rotating platform. Besides taking in the panoramic views, the next practice for visitors is Placing named love padlocks on the tower fence to showcase eternal love. This location has also been depicted in Korean movies, and TV shows.  I highly recommend taking in the commanding views during the day and at night. The night scene takes Seoul’s glimmering lights and bustling city background noise to another level.', \"N Seoul Tower is one of many attractions in Seoul but it is something I consider a MUST for tourists to visit. The tower is located on top of a small mountain which you can reach by cable cars, buses, or even a hike (from what I've been told). And the accommodations, technology, and overall vibe of not just the tower but the surrounding area was absolutely stunning.  You'll get an amazing view over Seoul and it's surrounding mountains / nature. I visited S. Korea during 2018 - 2019 (pre-covid / pandemic) and looking back at this experience, it was really memorable. Nostalgic even. And personally, disregarding the tower's height, this experience was FAR superior than other towers like the CN Tower in Toronto. Seriously, tourists give it a visit, I recommend going during evening, you'll see the city nightlife come to life and the sun setting.\", \"It is a representative landmark of Seoul where you can enjoy the panoramic view of Seoul. Great opportunity to learn about Seoul's culture and history, as well as Great city views. There is plenty to explore around the tower after visiting the tower. Various dining options, Hanbok Culture Experience Center, Lock of Love, Namsan Park, Namsangol Hanok Village are near by.\", 'Stunning tower overlooking seoul cbd, inside the tower there is a projection art exhibition room before you reach the elevator that takes you to the viewing deck near the top. Around the tower is a nature reserve which serves as an amazing green space in the middle of Seoul.', \"Very romantic place. From the top you can enjoy city view. I think it's even more beautiful during sunset 🌇\", 'The Seoul tower is very beautiful.  But the most beautiful thing is the journey through the trails.', 'It’s not a great observatory but also provides an opportunity to do a little hike. There’s a small parking place on the foot of the tower. There’re some shops from one can buy small souvenirs. Like all other observatories, the telescope is actually coin-operated. So, just keep few coins if you want to enjoy a nice look of the great Korean capital.', \"It was amazing😁😁!! The walk was long and I was able to see nearly the whole of Seoul from up there. I just have to say, if you don't want to walk for nearly 1000meters up a mountain, you should take a cable car situated a little bit further away from the entrance of the mountain to Namsan Tower. But, in all, if you want to see a breath-taking scenery, definitely walk up the mountain🤣 (not for the faint hearted!!🚫) HAPPY 추석!!!🥳\", 'Excellent experience. Views of the city at night are beautiful. Perfect place to pick up souvenirs. You can hang out here for a bit as they have places to sit up in the tower, and also some small bites, and desserts. I would highly recommend the cable car up to the tower, unless you really like conquering long hikes with loads of stairs.', \"Has a great 360° view of Seoul. Fun place to spend time with family/friends. Lots of souvenir items available, snacks, drinks and amusements like arcade games and interactive installations. Different cafés in and out of the tower. Which makes it a bit hard to decide where to eat, it's a bit overwhelming, especially if you are already hungry 😂😅. I suggest to research the cafés beforehand so you won't waste time trying to decide where to eat. 😅\", \"Great views of the entire city, cable car ride is a treat. I'd recommend taking the cable car up to the tower, then walking down.\", \"Escape the daily rush for a little while and make your way to the observatory deck to discover Seoul's beauty from a different perspective. The N Seoul Tower (Korean: N서울타워), officially the YTN Seoul Tower and known as Namsan Tower or Seoul Tower, is a communication and observation tower located on Namsan Mountain in central Seoul. Height :- 236-meter (774 ft)  It’s a fantastic spot not only to take in views of the city but to learn a little bit about Seoul and South Korea while you are there.  Aside from a visit to the observation deck, one of the top activities for couples at N Seoul Tower is to hang a padlock from the fence around the plaza. I recommend walking up and down the hill instead of the cable car if you can. Observation deck tickets cost 10,000 won for adults (about $9) and 8,000 won for children 12 years old and younger as well as seniors (just over $7)\", 'Awesome place! Go on a clear day.

At the top of Namsan is the famous N Seoul Tower, also called Namsan Tower. Personally, I really like the four seasons of Namsan. When I was in elementary school, Namsan was a picnic spot in spring and autumn. It is one of the must-visit places in Seoul.', \"it's perfect to visit at this time just because of the weather and the scenic view... the flowers are blooming as well as entertainments at the top of the mountain.\", 'Very nice view and is totally worth the walk!

The 236-meter tall tower marks the second highest point in Seoul. Plaza P0/B1 (Lobby): Includes: Entrance to Observatory, Information Desk, Alive Museum, Cafe, Children\\'s Theater, Nursing room.It was the first multipurpose tower to be established in Korea, effectively incorporating a sightseeing observatory to a broadcasting tower.

The tower\\'s observatory offers an unobstructed view of the whole city, allowing it to become one of the all-time favorite attractions of Seoul citizens as well as domestic and international tourists.

Evening view is eye catching. ❤❤', 'Beautiful place to catch some stunning views of the sprawling city below.', 'One of the hallmarks of Seoul, a beautiful tower. Getting here is part of the experience - you can either take a bus or cable car. The path to the tower is amazing, and you can admire great views of the city even before reaching the tower.

My visit was on a weekday night so there was no waiting to buy tickets or go up in the elevator. They offered a variety of places to eat for kids and couples. There was public transportation.

Beautiful city views. You can also take the bus up and down.', \"The perfect place to have a complete Seoul city view. The view from the observatory deck is truly amazing and the most interesting part comes when the sun sets. Don't miss to visit the the place.

Do use klook/kday to if you want to head up to the tower!', \"Having been to many cities worldwide, I have been up my fair share of observation towers. And sadly, this has got to be the worst one. It's as if whoever designed the observation deck, did not do any research into what makes a good one. I went at sunset time in hopes of enjoying the city lights. Annoyingly, the observation deck area is filled with souvenir shops, coffee shops and even a candy shop. All of these produce a lot of light that reflects on the windows inside, making it hard to see outside and even more difficult to take pictures. To add onto that, the windows are incredibly dirty and are covered in fingerprints. The outside was also caked in a decent layer of dust. There is no outside platform, so this is all you get. The one goal of an observation deck is to be able to observe, and this goal cannot be accomplished properly. It was honestly a huge disappointment, and I would not recommend the hassle of taking a cable car and then wasting even more time trying to go up the tower just for this.\", 'I highly recommend taking in the commanding views during the day and at night.

I hate dust dust micro dust dustdustdust', 'Make sure to check the Air pollution before you go so you have a good visibility.', 'This is one of the most famous landmarks in Korea. No trip to Korea is ever complete without going here. May it be day time or night time, the view at N Seoul Tower is picturesque. Visit here during day time if you want to take nice pics with the tower itself, the love locks, and other places. But, visit here at night time if you want to see the beautiful lights of the cityscape/nightscape of Seoul.  It may be accessed via walking/hiking, bus, and cable car. I don’t really recommend using the walking trail if you don’t want to get tired and look drained in your photos. There are also a lot of restaurants to eat at and spots to take pictures at.

I enjoyed my 2.5 hours just roaming around & eating lunch. It was such an enjoyable time!', \"Quite pricey to get to the top, but very nice 360° view on the whole city, so worth it. Just make sure to go there when there is good weather and there is no fog hovering above the city, otherwise it may ruin you experience.  PS: Best view I've had on the toilet so far! 😅\", 'A nice place to visit in Seoul city.', 'Great views of the city! Worth visiting 🥰', \"Amazing place. Night view of the city is amazing. Better to visit during evening time as you get the view of day and night together. Gets little crowded with night. Seating arrangements are not too good. Don't buy ticket in advance.\", 'Really clean, well-maintained landmark with great views of  Northern,, Western,, ans Southern Seoul. \"Locks of Love\" literally, not the hair type, where each couple in love professes their love on a lock, key chain or anything really and locks it to a rail.  They take this serious enough to even make Christmas trees of it. Unlike a permanent tattoo, if you break up, you take your key and remove the lock, if you want. There\\'s a few place to eat at the base of the tower, there\\'s interesting benches that look like the buckled from your weight and a good spot for couple poctures.  You can take a bus to the top, walk up the paved road or there are trails you can hike up. I took the trails, only 1km up, and on the way down had a nice jog through many of them that circle the hill.  Lots of fun, great family, couple, or solo outing. Enjoy 😃!', 'Simply breathtaking!!!.All of Seoul from one place❤️', \"Very beautiful! I advise you to visit at 4pm / 5pm and stay to watch the sunset, because the view is wonderful and by watching the sunset there you can see the tower day and night. The ticket price is fair for the service it offers, ₩ 11,000. Don't forget to charge your phone and camera, as you will definitely want to take lots of pictures there! ^^ For those who have a lot of energy in their legs I recommend walking up the hill, the climb is long but there are many observatories on the way with a privileged view of the city, I recommend going on a not so hot day. And take a padlock to hang on the wall. It is not necessary to climb the tower to have a legal experience.\", \"This is my first time visiting namsan tower. It's nice place to spend our weekend\", \"It's a rather OK experience, but I wouldn't say mandatory when visiting Seoul. The view is impressive, but it tends to be crowded, expensive and overall a little bit overrated. In my opinion there are better places for taking pictures and seeing the skyline of the city.\", 'Nice place to visit, very cute and pleasurable experience. The love lock hand rails are nice to see. They also have a game place and gift shop.', 'Nice place to see whole of Seoul from high point. There is also shops and cafes. Specific bus is needed to reach there. Cars are not allowed', 'Iconic symbol of Korea My 1st time visit as of 2009, 2nd visit was at 2019;', 'Great place to take pictures from the City, you can either walk a lot of stairs, or take a cable car.

Park your car nearby and take yellow bus to go up hill.\", \"Highest place in seoul!

The view of Seoul metropolitan will let you feel how far you are from so called busy life. Lots of other places to visit near by. A visit to N Seoul tower with a good plan will make your day a interestingly memorable day.', 'Except for the fairly long queues (we visited at around 7PM) the experience you get is unique and worth all the 11000KW (around 10$ at today’s rate). We visited the tower in the Halloween time and everything was very nicely decorated. The views are fantastic and the 840 stairs long walk to get up might sound a bit scary, but it really isn’t. It is magnificent to walk up because there is also a nice panorama terrace where you can take a break. For people who don’t enjoy walking there is always the cable car that brings you up in no time. At the Seoul Tower, to get all the way up the elevator accelerates at around 8 meters/second and after only 30 seconds you are already at the top of Seoul !', 'The view was spectacular. You’ll have a 360 degree view of Seoul from above. The walk up hill towards the tower was nice and comfortable. There are many artists providing caricature painting or drawing services at the top of the hill.  Best time to visit is early morning or just right before sunset. Golden hour will provide mild light which is best for photography & the city will look a lot better at those times.', 'Great views of the city for a fair price (we booked through Klook for nearly half price). Make sure you use the restroom at the top, insane views for a bathroom!', 'Having so many people around you, you find it quiet calm and peaceful place. High above the city, it provides great sightseeing. I sometimes went there to see the sunsets. A great place to visit.', 'Seoul tower offers the most amazing & complete ariel view of the city unlike any other place. However one needs to be careful before going up, since if it is foggy then its a waste as you wont be able to see much. Interesting fact - the tower itself uses lights to indicate whether the visibility is clear or not, so its a good practice to watch for the lights and then make your way there. You can get to the base of the tower for free, which itself is good enough to get a splendid view. But if you want to spend money, you can pay more and make your way up the tower which as a restaurant with a better 360 view. There are two ways to get there - you can trek your way up a nice path or take the bus. The only downside is that it is super crowded, and you need to jostle for space to get a decent view.', 'Awesome views of downtown Seoul. Lots of restaurants and cafes, small stores and such. Has a cable car to take you to the top. Cable car entrance is located on the north side near the tunnel exit. Price is $7 American one way.', 'Stunning! Stunning! Stunning view from the top!  Just disappointed with the staff at the Cable Car Line were not friendly, I was freezing my fingers were cold and frozen. I saw the heater and tried to warm my fingers up for few seconds. JUST FOR FEW SECS, I knew there was barrier line near the heater. They sshh sshh me away as if I was a duck.  Dude! Seriously you knew it was super cold outside and your gesture was not appropriate to a guest.', 'The best. The tower has a lovely view. I recommend the hike on foot, at least downwards. It is fully illuminated at night (even the mountain road). The way up is recommended to be done at daylight where you will enjoy the lovely park scenery especially during spring or autums. Stay at the tower till sunset - it is rather crowded, so you can be in a restaurant. The hike down is fully illuminated and lovely. We loved it.', \"It was nice, but a bit expensive for what it was. Youre basically paying 16,000 per adult for a view of Seoul. There is a cafe and a tourist shop at the top, but that's it. Not bad for half a day, but wont go back.\", \"We didn't reach the opening hours of the tower but we got the cable car up there and the view was pretty amazing. It's worth it to reach the top even if you don't visit the tower.\", \"I was a little bit too late. I should have visited the tower before sunset. I think that's the best time to visit this tower. However, this tower still looks beautiful and awesome. I already know that this tower is located on top of a mountain, but did not expect if visiting this tower can be so tiring. I strongly recommend visiting this tower by riding the shuttle bus or the cable car, especially if you  visit this place at night in fall/winter. I personally won't be able to walk to this tower at night. But maybe I will try to walk to this tower next time in the afternoon in spring, so the weather is not so cold.\", 'Great place to visit! Beautiful view of the city. Have been here twice during my stay, the view at night is much better than during the day, because of the smog. (You even have a great view while using the toilet!) I recommend going up by cable car, since it is a long walk up with very uneven stairs steps. The prices to go up the tower are very reasonable.', 'Fun tram up the mountain making it easy to get to. The view was spectacular! We enjoyed the millions of little locks with wishes/love messages. There is a restaurant and gift shop selling the usual wares. Lots of nooks and crannies you can enjoy the view from!', \"Beautiful experience, the views are incredible!! We couldn't have asked for a more beautiful place to see all of Seoul,it was full of charm and picturesque keepsakes we just couldn't get enough of. You could buy any kind of gifts you wanted at different prices. There are different kinds of restaurants and coffee shops you cant just choose one, and the night view was so beautiful you cant just stay and watch, you have to take pictures because you want to remember this forever.  The line to get to the tower is long but it goes really fast, and the line at the tower is even longer but definitely worth the wait. We can't wait to comeback and create more memories!!\", 'Beautiful 360° perspective of the city, make sure you choose a sunny day to visit; avoid windy days as well as it can get pretty cold up there. There are 2 ways up, one from the Namdaemun Market side which has proper stairs, and the other from Hannnam, which cuts through the forest like a small hiking trail. Cute restaurants with burgers or noodles, a bit pricey but well, you get to enjoy your hotdog looking at the valley, with the river and the many peaks.', 'Nice view Over Seoul', \"Very photogenic place to take pictures, not only for it's panorama but also the wall of locks. You can find a little shop on the top of the mountain and buy little lock and write your wishes on it and put it on the wall among the others. We were visiting this place in the last week of August where the traditional cultural performances took place. We were introduced to several musical instruments, fight weapons and dances with a sword. Quite unique experience!\", 'Cool sights! Took the bus up and the cable car down. Great experience with a nice gift shop.', \"Nice view of the city. Though the bright lights from the candy store in one section of the tower adds glare to the glass, so you see shadows when looking out to the city. Book tickets online as they are cheaper. Holographic room before heading up was fun. If you came from a long day of walking and sightseeing, best to take the cable car. If you decide to walk, it's about a 20 mins on an inclined slope.\", 'Took cablecar up to the tower. Little to no wait to get to the top and travel to the viewing  area. Amazing view of Seoul, second only to Namhansansong at night.', 'One of positive experience in Korea. Walking, seeing beautiful landscapes and flowers. There are several nice stop by spots in the park. We actually enjoyed spending whole day in there. first part of day - walking in the park. second part of day - entertainment into Seoul Tower. Food courts are not recommended because of middle quality. Even ice cream is terrible :) But it is joy to visit with children. Highly recommended place. Good Seoul!', 'Another landmark to visit while you’re adventurously roaming around the city. Located upon the hill .. you’re able to reach the tower by bus or walk. Due to its extreme popularity by international tourists and even local ones, some crowds in the certain times are expected and unavoidable. But it will be worth your attempt by the time you get to see the stunning cityscape at the top , believe me 😉✨', \"Beautiful view! To go up you can take bus #02 all the way to the top, and then walk a little bit to the tower. The tickets  are purchase inside the tower. There's a few restaurants you can eat at, with a nice view. You can also buy post cards and stamps, and dropped them off right there too.\", 'Excellent panoramic view.', 'I guess this place is a must visit if you are in Seoul. You can either take bus, cable car or hike to go up. Pretty nice city view and cold ( we were there in December). You also can find the famous love locks with different sizes, shapes, messages from around the world there. Recommend to go there late afternoon so you can see afternoon and evening view at the same time. We got free ticket from Shinsegae to go to up to observation deck (Ticket price Won11000 at the ticket counter) a bit queue to go up. While waiting for the lift they show some digital art stuff. Oh yes before go up they will help you to take picture and once you reach the top you can check the photo and purchase it if you want. Honestly to say its not worthy to go up to the observation deck. Once is enough lol.', \"Seoul Tower is one of the landmark that we have it in our itinery. It was quite a long walk up hill after the train station to reach the cable car station, and then a brisk queue to board the cable car. After reaching Namsan cable car station, there's a flight of stairs to reach the tower so it is not really disable friendly. Quite a nice place to go especially during the dusk so that we get pictures during the day as well as the night.\", 'Superb experience seeing whole of Seoul from the top. Absolutely must do thing if you are visiting Seoul for the first time.', 'You should definitely go up to the observatory. The view is spectacular! At night the city lights up and the view is incredible. We went up just before sunset to have the chance to see the city both in sunlight and in darkness. The tower itself is full of attractions, coffee, and restaurants with great view.', \"Catch the cable car to the top.  And walk the last steps to the top.  Visit the gift shop. When going to the top of the tower look a the roof of the elevator. Great views from the top.  There's a cafe at the top. We were lucky enough to catch a demonstration of swordsmanship. And on special occasions you can watch the lighting of the signal smoke stacks a must do if you have time. The most amazing views of Seoul from the top floor of the tower. In winter it is so cold at the top especially when the wind blows.\", 'The view is absolutely stunning, especially at sunset and night. It is one of the few places where you can see entire Seoul city at a glance.', 'This place is worth it. The view outside the tower is    breathtaking, although somewhat crowded. To get to the plateau, you must either drive, walk up, or take a bus. I recommend going up the tower for sunset for gorgeous pictures, sadly it will be crowded. Walking down the mountain is really relaxing at night time with look out points that are pretty isolated. Beautiful view of the Seoul skyline.', 'Another iconic tourist attractions in Seoul', 'A great visit to the top and to experience the views from the N Seoul tower is fantastic! Very busy so prepare for some lines but worth the wait for a great view of the city as a reward. Some cafes and markets outside to explore as well as lots of history. Can walk up the road, steps or take the cable car to get there', \"The best place to see the whole city! So romantic, but very much a couple destination. We took the stairs up to the top. It took a while but so worth it. You can book a trip that includes the Seoul tower and get there by bus. But when you don't see and feel the same. The restaurants are nice and shops was very cute. A lot of tourist, but very clean and chill. I would recommend it!!\", 'This place was just wonderful, from the bottom of the tower to the top, the view is incredible. There are also plenty of shops and activities along the way as well as restaurants. I was impressed by how respectful people were, it was crowded but totally worth the view. Easily accessible from Myeongdong we even got to take the bus (don’t forget your Tcard!!). From the many breathtaking places we saw in Korea , this mix of modernity and traditional views is always at the top of the list, it brings you such a feeling to be at the top of such a place you should definitely include it in your travel plan!', 'You can see a panoramic view of the whole city. Well maintained. Exciting cable car journey. Loved the love locks😍. You should go up to the top of tower. The view is really amazing. Never miss it. The queue for the cable car is too much. Waited more than an hour. You have options to walk through the stairs if you like.', \"A must see if you’re visiting Korea. 9.500 won to take the cabin car up to the tower and another 9.500 for going up to the tower. There’s combos for popcorn and drinks that are reasonable.  There's quite a bit of walking but there's several lifts and most places are handicap accessible.  There's long lines so come prepared to spend 4-5 hours easily.  There were shows going on and several other attractions.\", 'Great place to hang out with friends and family. The view up here is spectacular. On a clear day one can see Seoul as far as your eyes can see. The tower at the top has a three hundred and sixty degree view and has photographs of the different countries one is facing at. There are lots of cafes and restaurants. You can take the cable car 🚠 or have a 20 minute hike up to the TOP.', \"It's pretty cool. You can go at night and take some pretty good pics of the skyline. It also might be nice to see the sunset there. Lots of couples and families, lots of tourists. Prepare thyself. (Also, I don't think that paying to go up in the elevator is 100% worth it. You can check out the love lock terrace for free)\", 'This place was amazing during sunset. And if you’re just too lazy to walk, they have cable car and you can experience a beautiful scenery during autumn especially. Stay a little bit longer to get some drinks and enjoy the beautiful lights brightened the tower.', 'Best view of Seoul and it is free. If you want to have a better view you can go up to the tower.', 'Walking around the tower and watch the sunset is a peaceful time there. From Myeong Dong station, you can take the bus line 2 and 4. And you can take the cable car at the foot of the hill. You can see the whole Seoul city from the tower.', 'A MUST visit while in Seoul. We hiked to the top via the stair path while my MIL took the bus up. We were hot and sweaty by the time we got to the top, but it was worth every step!  The view is amazing. You really can’t beat it in Seoul.  There’s a gift shop at the bottom of the tower where you can buy “love locks” to leave on the railings at the top. There’s a gold pig (in 2019) to make a wish on. There’s food and ice cream as well. You can walk through some parts without a ticket but you need a ticket to go to the top of the tower.  It’s a really neat experience. Even if you don’t got to the very top, a trip up to the base is worth it!', \"Some fantastic parkland if you decide to walk up.....this is an arduous task and not for the faint hearted. If you're unfit or just a little lazy, take a taxi or bus 😉 The tower itself has fantastic views overlooking Seoul and for the more romantic there is a tradition of placing locks and tags with messages of undying love on the rails there. Take your own or buy one there. Refreshments were reasonably priced and the N Burgers were pretty impressive to be fair. Worth the 2 hour walk up many steps and steep paths as far as I was concerned but definitely taxi next visit.\", \"Beautiful mountain both before and after sundown. Can opt for either the cable car or hike up the mountain to enjoy the fresh air with splendid views. Definitely filled with people both tourists and locals. The place filled with love. You can either bring your own locks or purchase them at the stores provided. Do take note to only put the locks up at the allocated spaces to avoid it being removed. There's churros and snacks too. When it gets a bit cold, you can visit the arcade to get things heated with family, friends or partner. There are plenty of places to take photos of and you can't help but reflect as you watch the night skyline. Really enjoyed my experience there!\", \"Awesome view from mountain top. Didn't see any point to go to the top of the tower. Take cable car up or walk up. The walk is quite enjoyable. Highly recommend a visit, especially on a clear day. Don't bother if it's hazy.\", 'Almost over 10 times I been there', 'Literally one of the top must sees in Seoul no matter what other sights u gonna go for. Albeit with the crowds of people lining up to get to the top of the city, the overall experience is still great. It’s a bit expensive to have the entry ticket, but it totally worth the cost as you have the experience posting postcards to your families n fds. (Yes this post office is exclusive for those whom paid the entry fee to the tower)', 'Not much in the observatory, but i enjoyed the room full of lights before going up. Love locks are nice too. Dont take the cable car, waste of money.', 'Very popular observatory tower in Seoul. Features tower observatory deck, light projection holding and waiting area, interactive lift, love lock area, coffee and souvenir shops. You have to check the weather on your visit so the view from the deck will not be obstructed by clouds. Its raining when I went so photos are not so good. I think its great and romantic when not raining.', \"One of the famous tourist spot in Seoul. This is a must in the itinerary. I've been here twice but I still want to go back. This place gives a very relaxing feeling after a long walk. There's a lot of things that you can do in this place. And everything you need is here. The view from above during night time is amazing.\", 'Beautiful views of Seoul. Classic nightscape. Plenty of places to eat, drink, shop. The views from the observation deck are ruined by the lights inside. Have to put camera to glass to lose the glare. Hello Kitty island is there. Good places to have a beer with a view. Can walk up from myeongdong or take the cable car. Great views on the way up and down.', \"We hiked from the bottom to the top, it was quite easy if you are fit, and it's a short hike too. The view from up top is amazing, you have to pay to go on top of the tower for the view of seoul and there is a souvenir shop up there. It was an amazing experience to be up there though if you are a tourist. Even the bathroom has a view!\", 'A must visit in South Korea in you are in Seoul. The view up here is spectacular. Such an amazing view of Seoul. Even if you don’t get a ticket to go up the tower, it’s totally worth going up the cable car or hiking up the hill. You can take the cable car or have a 20 minute hike up to the TOP. Taking the cable car up will save you some breath. If you are going at night hiking will be better. During day time there a huge line for the cable car. Day time and night got its own beauty. During day time on a clear day one can see Seoul as far as your eyes can see. Awesome views! Recommend going during the day for photos. The tower at the top has a three hundred and sixty degree view and has photographs of the different countries one is facing at. Between the tower and cable car is an area where there are thousands of keys locked into fences and sculptures which is a very beautiful sight. There are few cafes and restaurants. I went in summer and autumn its perfect. In winter it’s quite cold I heard. Anyways worth a visit. Ah don’t forget to bring a padlock with names written if you are interested because on top it’s quite expensive. Loved the place', 'Schedule for a night view is the greatest. The weather during early summer is a fine cool and the view is spectacular. Took the cable cable up was fast. There many restaurants at the Seoul tower. You can further buy a ticket to go higher up to the tower TOP for a different experience.  The view is just go nice and worth the time going there.', \"Great views. I imagine it would be beautiful at night as well. There's a restaurant up top and a Twosome Place coffee shop. The gift shop sells postcards and stamps. You can write, decorate, stamp and mail them right from the top of the tower. Steep walk from the busses to the tower\", 'An amazing place for a walk over thousands of stairs. A nice evening spend to be over. It has multiple water taps on d way as well and nice and clean toilets.

It has multiple restaurants Inside the tower building.', 'this place is cold enough but they have beautiful scenery, you can go here by bus which can be found easily. Many flowers, plants and trees along the way. The route is pretty hard for the elder. The tower located on the peak of the hill. No merchant allowed in this area, so if you want to buy some stuff or food, they have one classy building like a tavern near the tower.', \"Beautiful at night! Don't go on a cloudy day! Check out all the floors. The bathrooms also have huge windows which is interesting. Outside there a lock bridge which is amazing to see\", \"Probably a must see in Seoul. Really can get any degree of experience for a reasonable price (but can spend a bit too, think cable car round trip, elevator to the top, any food or souvenirs).  But the view is pretty terrific from the city and the experience is grand.  Just make sure you consider visibility (which is not a guarantee) when planning your trip; going all the way up is probably going to disappoint if you can't see anything...\", 'Great city view and nice place to spend sometime with your family/kids/couple. Good varieties of restaurants, shops, game centers, photo corners that you would need half a day to cover most major areas in this tower.', 'While I was there the gondola wasn’t working so i had to walk up the hill to the tower. Lots of stairs but totally worth it! Great view over Seoul. In combination with the Lotte tower this is a perfect complement from the other side.', \"Cable car's pack. ... take a direct bus up then walk down the hill would be a better option.  There's cafe and restaurant at the top... so you can get some snacks and nice coffee at the top of the hill.\", \"Take the cable car and go to the top of the tower. It's worth it. It's more than just a tower with a view... Although the views were superb. The light room with amazing. Gift shop was high quality and there's a restaurant too.\", \"N Seoul Tower is the signature observatory tower of Seoul, sitting on top of Namsan Park. It also houses thematic museums, cafes, restaurants and souvenir shops, so you have plenty of options on what to do.  At 10,000 won per entry, N Seoul Tower is one of the cheapest observatories that I have been to. You can mix and match your ticket to have museum entries, food or dining experience to go with it. For a really romantic night, you can make advanced booking (they don't accept walk-ins) for n.Grill, a high class French restaurant.  Really enjoyed my experience here. We had a lovely coffee at the cafe on the observatory tower with an equally lovely view. Highly recommend in for an evening outing paired with dinner so you get to see both the day and night view.\", 'Beautiful place.i love it.', 'Crowded but worth trying. You can choose to walk to the tower or go by bus. I saw many Koreans jogging. It must be better to walk slowly and witness natural landscape', \"This place is amazing! Lots to see here and plenty of restaurants to munch or eat or drink to although of course a bit in the expensive side. The best way to get here is to take the yellow bus either 2, 3 or 5. They all end up at the very top of the tower where you can just walk the rest of the way. I didn't know that till I was ready to come down. There are also cable cars you can take down but the bus is the cheapest. It cost 10,000₩ to get to the o Top of the observation deck for a complete 360° view but otherwise it's free to walk around and take pictures of the love bridge.\", 'Go here directly from downtown local park by bus, took around 30 minutes. You can get here by cable car too but I prefer bus to see how high we should go uphill. Like others say, they’re lot of lock chain and love setting to make couple more comfy with the ambiance. There’re lot of restaurants inside too for you who get starve over wandering outside. I went there on winter 2018 and you can see there’re leftover snow on the ground. Definitely will go there again on autumn to see the best view of orange leaves 🍁 남산 타워 너무 좋아요 😁', \"The view from the 5th floor observation area was nice. You can see far away. Getting up to the tower was an adventure in itself.  The cable car ride was fun although it can be a little too crowded. You can probably walk up the mountain but when it gets hot it's way better to pay for the cable car. Adter the cable car you can walk along and see all the heart locks people leave there. The mountain top is a good place to spend a day especially for tourists but it is more geared towards couples. Families and groups will have a good time too.\", 'Namsan Tower is always a great time for family, friends, dates, or even tourists. But I think it is only great if you go up the short hike (1.5km) from the Grand Hyatt. It’s a nice, scenic hike that isn’t the main way up, but surely the most enjoyable with the best views. I recommend going during the day, but the night views are also great!', 'Loved the view even though it was raining. Will definitely go back to experience more of the attractions.', \"The best place to unwind. With or without partner it's okay go to here. Very beautiful and nice place. I want to come again.\", 'A must visit place!! The view of Seoul city and beyond from the observatory was simply A-M-A-Z-I-N-G !!! Perhaps also my first visit was at night. This time around I had a guide and the weather was good!! Clear sunny skies 😎', 'Worth the trip up. Beautifully tended gardens and park leading up to a small, modern, and understated market area with several restaurants and souvenir shops. $10 to go to top of tower, but free to still see great views if you want to stay at the lower levels.  Local tour buses stop at the tower or can be accessed by cable car.', 'I took a walking hike up the hill and took the public bus down.  Spent nearly 3hrs there.  Nice restaurants and nice views.  Take some time to explore and prepared to climb lots of staircases to explore more pretty corners.', \"Surrounded by a lovely 30 minute walk to the top of the mountain, I'd really recommend skipping the bus and doing it on foot. When you get there there's a great food court for lunch and some lovely bars for a beer with a view. Even if you don't go to the top, include this in your day exploring Seoul.\", \"A must do in Seoul! See the city from the sky deck. Great little digital art pieces before you enter the observation deck. We took the Namsan cable car up to the tower but there's a lovely hike you can do with good weather. If you're going there with a loved one - join others by adding your love lock below the tower along the walk way bridge.\", 'After a lovely walk ( yes, not the bus or cable car ) through the lush green forests ( was spring!) to the impressive tower. Many places to snack, drink or restaurants around. Good views but the W10000 ticket to the observation deck gives great orientation of Seoul for a first visitor.', 'One of must visit attractions in Seoul', \"Beautiful place to visit and great for pictures! I recommend taking the cable car. It is fast, inexpensive, and easy! I recommend eating before or after as the food at the top can be a bit more expensive is you're on a budget.\", 'View in here is refreshing is refreshing and relaxing. Tourists are everywhere but since the place has several good places to take pictures, you will definitely get a perfect shot. We are in a  tour package so it is very easy to us to get to the place.', 'My very first stop in Seoul, such a fun place!  Got rather lost walking/hiking up through Namsan Park, perhaps would recommend cable car both ways! I felt it was good value but actually there are many cute shops and things to see outside as well esp appreciating all the many many love locks! Bring your own or buy one there', 'We had so much fun, and I really like high places because I can take beautiful photos. We made a really long queue for going there despite the hour (it was quite late) because you need to take the cableway but it was totally worth it. After the tower we made all our way to the observatory and it was AMAZING, I could take some beautiful photos and the city view was so breath taking!', 'Top of the Seoul city. You can get to there by a couple of ways, by cable car, bus or on foot. The hiking trail is very nice or should be a manageable one even if you are not a frequent hiker. You can enjoy red leaves in Autumn. There is also a couple of restaurants on the top of the tower. The cafe and fast food shop are also good and offer seating so that you can take a break on the top of the hill.', \"Instead of getting a bus up like what other people seemed to be doing, we ended up climbing up the road through the park to get here. We were a bit rushed since we still had one more stop after the tower. We used the Discover Seoul pass for the entry ticket. There is a number on the ticket and you can only line up if your ticket number is within the range on display. While waiting you can get something to eat, shop for some souvenirs, or go look at a display like the Hello Kitty one by the ticketing area. The top had really nice views of the city. The glass had cities and their distance from the Tower which I thought was quite nice, particularly since Auckland was there. We somehow managed to get there for sunset which was quite nice. The plaza downstairs had plenty of shops and restaurants. Would've like to spend a bit more time to have a more thorough look at the area.\", 'Very calm place, one of my favorite for the rest. But of course, rest after little hiking only)', \"Good experience with great views. Spent about 2 hours here overall, staff were friendly spoke good english and price was very affordable. From the nearest metro station, there's a shuttle bus that took me up to the cable car station, and the cable car took me up to the tower which involved a bit of waiting around, but ended up being quite fun. The tower has a modern feel to it, and provides awesome views of the city.\", 'Very good spot to have a 360 view of Seoul. Good walk to reach the top or you can use the cable car. The place is quite busy in the day. Definitely unbeatable for an amazing sunset. Enjoy!', 'Definitely one of the places every tourist should visit in Seoul. There are two ways to hike to the top. The one of the front, at the start of the cable car, has more steps. There is also one other way, if you walk to the left from the cable car station, that goes more around it. The last one gave me more a natural park feeling. Once at the top, the hike gives you a satisfactory feeling.', \"Maybe I do not deserve to get love, but I'm still allowed to feel the loving atmosphere in N Seoul tower when history meets the modern city.\", \"It's a good place to take photos overlooking the city scape. There's a coffee shop if you want to sit and chill while looking down. Outside is the love lock area which is a nice place for couples pledging their love for each other. The tower also has the shop where they sell uniquely designed souvenir items which could not be found downtown.\", 'The tower is located quite far from the main road. You can ride bus just walk to reach the Tower. However, even if you ride the bus, you should do a small hiking to reach the tower. After that you should pay about 15000 won to go to the top of tower building. But, if you just want to lock your love key, no need to climb up to the top of tower building.', 'Place to be in Seoul. Fantastic view of all the city. I suggest to go around the sunset but you should visit it every hour of the day. Beautiful. Strongly recommended!', \"Namsan Seoul Tower is a great place to spend the day. We parked at the National Theatre and walked up, but if we had planned better, we would've taken the cable car. Parking at the National Theatre doesn't take cash, either, so you have to talk to an attendant and pay if you have a foreign credit card.  DON'T use Waze to try to find the tower. Map yourself to a good parking location. We ended up on the steepest, scariest roads I have EVER been on. 😂  There are several floors of the tower that are free to the public. You can also take an elevator to the top observation deck and upper floors. It's awesome to there! The views are great, and on the windows, it shows how far you are from other places in the world. One floor up from that, there are informational signs on the windows that explain what you're seeing, like the wall around Seoul.  On the ground, the love locks are so fun to look at. They even have a machine where you can buy a new love lock for 12,500 to 14,000 won.  Everyone working here speaks great English, so it's easy to ask questions, get food and shop if your Korean language skills aren't up to par.\", \"We can overlook the whole scenery of Seoul. If it's cloudy or foggy, it's better to visit there at night to enjoy night views!! Walking up the hills must be great hiking, but if you save your energy you can take a cable car. (7,000 won for one way, 9,500 won for round trip)\", 'We took the yellow public bus to reach here. Journey was a bit rough. Luckily my parents manage to get seats on the bus as the journey uphill is a bit rough.. Nice giew on top, instagrammable spots definitely! Worth a visit even without entering the tower.. Spend about 1 and half hours here to relax on the evening before sunset..', 'Amazing 360 view of Seoul and a of its suburbs, you cant fully comprehend how big the city is until seen from here. It was easy to get into as not so busy. They observe the covid 19 rules. I think it was worth the price (13000 won for an adult). A definite must do if visiting Seoul.', 'A good workout after eating for a whole week in Seoul if you choose to walk up the mountain. Do NOT follow google map directions of taking the blue line bus and getting off at Huam Mineral Spring, that walking trail is closed off. After some struggle with directions from locals, I walked back to the Library, which was one bus stop before I got off bus 402, and took the walking trail that ran parallel to the tour bus route. It’s a sloping trail that’s completely paved and should not be too difficult for most people. I went there in mid May on a sunny day and it was a nice walk. Saw families with small children and retirees exercising up and down the length of the trail.  There are buses that go up the mountain, bus 02 (yellow line) is one of the options that I found on my way back down. Get a T money card from a convenience store and load it at one of the machines in the train station if you’re using buses to get around.  Note: no taxis allowed up the mountain. I tried taking one instead of the bus and the driver said he can’t go there.  There’s a Starbucks and some food spots in the tower together with Hello Kitty Island with lots of cutesy props for photos and a gift shop selling Sanrio gifts.  Once you’re up in the observatory, it’s just a nice city view for pictures and another souvenir shop. You can buy post cards on the observatory level and send it using the mail box located there. However, there’s a note on the mail box that said something to the effect that no delivery is guaranteed. I mailed the post cards over two weeks ago and the recipients still haven’t received them, so use at your own discretion.', \"Took the cable car up here, I would recommend you taking the stairs down to enjoy the scenery if you're keen, view from up there during Autumn is amazing, probably a bit chilly for some as the wind tends to be stronger up there, overall experience quite good and would recommend coming up here to place your ever lasting love lock on the metal handrail (if you believe in such a thing), they say that your love for one another will be eternally lock together but you'll be at the mercy of the maintenance guy from removing it hahaha! Anyway it's fun, go give it a try.\", 'Great place, re-visited after 14 years. Great weather so the view was great from the observatory. Due to Covid-19 pandemic, it was not very busy at all for a Saturday. Had a great time.', 'Whole city is visible from height, awesome experience. Floor has some magic music and video..', 'Stunning views of the city!  Perfect walk from the Millennium Hilton.  Great experience and well priced.  I would consider this a must see when visiting Seoul.', \"pros - A charming, peaceful view of the city surrounded by nature.  - I guess 10 000 won is an okay price  - The surrounding hiking paths are a fun way to reach the tower's site  cons - The light show going up is a bit uninspired  - Didn't much care for the forced theme park vibe  I actually preferred the view when walking down from the tower's site on the main road. Still, the view was more than lovely at sunset.\", \"Amazing view, very crowded though. The base level with all the locks already gives a good view, so you can stick with that if it's too crowded. Hello kitty museum is pretty fun too.\", 'It was amazing view. Went there near sunset times. It was so great! The sun looks beautifully shimmering the tree. Wait until the light hits the tower. so worth to visit. Only pay for the cable car, not going up to tower, too crowded to go up.', 'Tower is located in the heart of Seoul station. There are 2 ways to reach the base of tower; by bus or by a cable car. From base of tower, entire city can be viewed. An high speed elevator takes to top of tower which further gives beautiful view. Recommended to visit after dark to enjoy a lit-up city view. Do check the OLED tunnel by LG just before elevator tickets', 'Absolutely worth the hike, no matter how our of shape you are.', 'It has a nice view of Seoul. Not much to do. There are few restaurants and coffee shops. Better come early in the morning as it becomes too crowded mid day onwards.', 'Good scenery. Grab a ticket for the cable car and enjoy. Best timing to go is ard evening to catch both day and night scenery. Grab a good spot at the observatory for the sunset', \"I'm not going to lie, even if you take the cable car, it's one heck of a climb. But it's gorgeous. I literally nearly cried at the awe and majesty of Seoul from above. And there's a lot to do inside, including cultural and historical stuff to check out.\", 'Great view from the top, still worthy to have beautiful  scenery from below the tower too. Visit any time either in the morning with sunrise or evening with sunset, you can have different experience. Do not forget to have ecopark reserved jungle walk (well developed walking stairs) from TOWER station down to  Dongguk University.', \"This is a must place to go especially when you are with your special someone. Riding the cable car was already an experience as you get to slowly see the entire Seoul. At the top, millions of locks and keys were so colorful it reminds you of that place in Paris. The view was prestine and they say dining in the tower should be included in your itinerary though we haven't include that in ours.\", 'Amazing views of the city. Surrounded by gorgeous park. Short walk or bus ride away from main train stations. The tower itself is pretty unremarkable in that it is kind of a generic shape (consider Tokyo skytree or Seattle space needle for comparison). But it’s the views and the surrounding scenery that make this place pretty remarkable. Do visit if you’re in Seoul.', 'A great place to visit for the view and the quirky, fun atmosphere. I recommend visiting N Seoul Tower in the evening as the night views are fantastic. It costs roughly ₩10,000 per person to get to the top floor observation deck (which I do recommend). Make sure to stop in the bathrooms at the top as well!  This place is a great place to go for a date as there are a lot of romantic spots and photo opportunities. You can also buy locks here to affix to one of the gates or other places near the base of the tower (similar to in Paris).', 'Finally I MADE IT HERE ! One of the place I want to go on my bucket list ! As amazing as in the Korean Drama 😍 Bought the tickets online as well as the N Burger 🍔. The view surrounding was LIT ! Beautiful hill, you can see seoul from above.', \"The view is worth getting to the tower. No need to go all the way though. It's a long wait for a minimal experience. Stay on the outside and walk around...breathtaking\", \"Beautiful tower views with entertainment, shops, restaurants etc. I've been to several towers in many countries and have never seen so much to do at one. We ate at the italian restaurant on the second floor once you've crossed the cable car and it was great with killer views.\", 'Great view for day and night. You can go in the late afternoon so you can enjoy both view. You can buy lock there also if you want to hang there', 'Very hight and colorful tower, that makes possible to see Seoul from \"another point of view\", showing the magic of the lights of these city. It\\'s easy to reach by feet from Myeong-dong station (just take the street on the right side of exits number 2 and 3).', \"A very iconic landmark of Seoul. This is also a must visit when you travel to Seoul. You can reach this place by cable car or bus. The place also one of the spot when you join the hop on hop off Seoul city tour bus. From the bus stop you have to walk for a few minutes to get to the tower. Don't forget to buy love lock and put your lock on the spot provided.\", 'It was a great place to see the whole city! Make sure you make reservations if you want to eat in the fancy restaurants or there are lots of casual options. Lots of things to see and do.', 'Great place to visit in Seoul. Best to go during sun set, astonish views of the city. There is a restaurant and a coffee shop. It is not too expensive to go up the tower to the observatory deck. Take the cable car up and then walk down the path on the way back. You can come with friends or children. 360 view', 'Great place to see a view of Seoul for free. Nice walk up - be prepared for relatively steep uphill walking. The VR place inside is a nice touch with a free go available.', \"Beautiful views of the city from the mountain, especially around sunset. There are also restaurants, shops, a video game arcade, and many spots to take photos. You can get up the mountain by bus, cable car (from Myongdong) or walking. There was a craft beer and music festival last time I went and we saw an excellent band called Blue Snake (mostly classic rock covers). I've not been to the top of the tower (too expensive) but the area around the tower at the top of the mountain is a must for anyone visiting seoul!\", 'One of the places you have to visit if you are in Seoul make sure you take a camera, money, comfortable clothes and shoes. There are buses that takes you up but you can walk and enjoy the park. You can find some stores at ground level and on top.', \"There's so much to see and do in N Seoul Tower. It was autumn when we went there so the leaves were falling on our way to the tower. It make take quite an effort to get to the tower though. The inclination is quite steep. But getting there will be very worth it especially with the view that you'll be seeing there. It's also a treat to see the tower glow green. It means that the fine dust is at a safe level.\", 'It feels good to be back, night time still the best time to come.', 'Took a bus there from Myeongdong station. The ride to the tower is about 30mins. Reached there slightly before dark so I could view the sunset and stayed till it was dark to view the city night view. The lights of the tower changes according to the air quality around Seoul. Blue indicates the air is clean and red if the pollution is high.', 'Great views of the city... Can get crowded, really crowded over the weekend as it is a popular spot with tourists and locals. Long waits for the viewing platform... There is a walking track up to the top which is a steep climb of both stairs and ramps, budget about 30-40 minutes for the climb... Or be lazy and take the cable car up, wait time for this can be long upto 40mins', \"Fun place to go to. I think it could be one of the must go at least once when you're in seoul! It's so high up there. You could either take a bus or take the cable car but if you do want to take the cable car, I would suggest you to pre-book it online so you won't have to wait in line for such a long time. In terms of what you can do in Namsan tower, you can take cool pictures of the scenery! You can also put down your own lock of love or friendship on the railings and take a commemorative photo! There's also a hanbok experience area on the lower ground floor where you can rent the hanbok and go around the tower to take pictures while you're wearing the traditional dress! It was a great experience for me\", \"We really enjoyed our trip to Namsan. It's certainly a romantic place and it seems as though many couples come here. There are trees for love locks and many a photo opportunity. The views are amazing! We went up to the tower and had a package which included popcorn and beer.\", 'Namsan tower and the area around offers amazing 360 degrees views of Seoul, but is at times very packed with tourists. The surrounding park has lots of tracks you can use to walk up/down to the tower while you enjoy the nature and views of Seoul.', \"The place was a quite nice to see the night view. It's a shame that the weather wasn't that good. (You guys must check the fine-dust rate before you go)\", 'Put it on the must visit destination if you in seoul. The light on the night is amazing with cold winds. Suitable for couples. There are shops and restaurants and easy access convenient stores nearby.', \"These picture are taken in Aug, 2010. After drinking a beer, We went to The Namsan Tower by bus for no particular reason. It was rains. We had so happy time. I'm still missing those days.\", 'You can see the entire city. Unfortunately I went on a cloudy day but it was decent, though I was advised by the clerk before purchasing the ticket that the view would not be great. There are also items to see outside the tower in the quad.', \"Very cool place to see when you are visiting Seoul. It's at the peak so you get to see Seoul from very beautiful high point. Great place to enjoy and great places to take photos. Highly recommend for anyone to stop here and enjoy nice lovely afternoon.\", \"One of the better views of Seoul, especially at night, can be found here.  One can walk up to the tower if they don't want to pay for the cable car, but it's not for those out of shape.  Restaurants can be found in the tower itself and in the square that surround it at the base.\", 'Now it is beautiful time to visit. There is lots of facilities at the top of mountain.', '3 options to reach here. Walking from Myeong dong and get the cable car (need to walk a bit, just a bit more to reach the tower), by public transport - bus (stop at the bus station and need a long way to climb the hill), by car (just need few step to climb 😂). The restaurant at the tower was super B. Better climb at noon, around 3 / 4 pm, watch the sun set here. What a lovely place.', 'Beautiful Place, very near the city, easy to reach. Must visit in evening to night time. Bus is the most convenient way of reaching there. I also liked the small amusement centre inside the tower', 'Due to holidays cable car was crouded, we walked instead for only 30 minutes going up. It gave us a nice view. Going down the bus station had 1 hour queue so we went down by walking, the trail has good light and lots of people around, pretty safe', 'It is located on a hill and you can go there either by bus or by cable car. Many people go there by walking to get some exercise. It used to be the tallest tower in Seoul at one point. There is a teddy bear museum inside the tower complex. It is a beautiful place for sight-seeing. Many korean dramas have been shot here, which makes it a popular place among Korean drama lovers.', 'Such a beautiful place especially in autumn with the yellow and red leaf. You can come there by bus, cable- car or by walking.', 'We went to Namsan Seoul Tower last night (17/Sept) for 2 Adults and 3 Kids and cost us 65K krw.', 'So much good in heart Los amoss😍😍😍EKA', 'Namsan Tower is sort of a must go when you visit Seoul. You can either take the cable car up or just walk.  It takes about 30 minutes to walk up but the trail is quite pretty, a lot of trees and a nice deck near the top that gives you a good view of the city. It’s 10,000 won to go up to the observatory, I think it was totally worth it.', 'Take the bus if you can’t hike. Will take around 30 min leisure hike. Disappointed because it’s jammed packed with tourist from China. Literally more than 5 big busses brought up this hoard of tourist at the same time.', \"Awesome place. The tower is a huge building with a great view over the city. You don't have to take the cabin up the hill because the walk around the hill is beautiful and takes only 20 minutes. You have to visit this place at night.\", 'A landmark of Seoul. Perfect place to see Seoul from the top. There are many ways to go up to the tower. Walking up through Namsan Park is one of the best. It is an easy hike with beautiful scenery along the way.', \"The views are spectacular (especially at sunset). Lots of tourists that you can't really get away from up top, but there are so many routes up to the top. I'd recommend the trail by the old stone wall. It goes through a beautiful park and had almost no tourists.\", 'It’s one of the most famous spot in Seoul - must visit. We walked from the Namsangol Hanok Village, fresh atmosphere, nice weather. We really like it. It only can be reached by the cable and it’s worth. You can see full view of Seoul city if you go to the top of the tower. So 2 tickets: cable from the bottom and other ticket to go to the top. There are some ice-cream shops and cafes. But do not try Churos, its really bad hahaa', 'We have an awesome experience here. Going up we choose to take the cable car and purchase ticket in klook for the attraction inside the N Tower. Going down we  choose to take the stairs coz the line going down usi g the cable car is soo long. Its a long walk but thanks to the cold weather its a bit easier for us.', 'The view is breathtaking. It even much more fun if you could take a stroll from down to top. Slow walking with kids plus few pitstop took me about 2 hours to reach tower. It was a good experience for kids to appreciate the beauty of nature. When you reach at top you must rent a hanbok (traditional korean wear) for a pictures around the tower area for 3 hours. Ample F&B outlet there for you too. Just enjoy the scenery. A must place to visit in korea #wonderlust #familytrip', 'Very beautiful. I stay very near to this place. 3minutes of walking. Very calm. Please dont come here during weekend. So many people. I stayed until close time. Very clean place. Process of ticket redemption is very easy.', 'Located at the top of the hill. You can get here with so many choices! Going on a budget? Just get into myeong dong station and hike to the tower it takes around 2 hours till you get there. Or you can try the cable car, and last you can take a shuttle bus to the tower ( mostly from myeong dong station ).  At first we decided to take the cable car, but since as we got there the queue already get too long so we hike to the tower by foot :) ( since its autumn, so yea we made to the top cause the weather wasnt hot ). But its worth! The view is beautiful from the top ( you already can see the view since you hike to the tower ).  We spent few hours there, from eat, took a photo using hanbok, and enjoy seoul city and night from the tower. Should visit if you go to seoul!', 'Nice place to enjoy and relax. Fascinating scenery from top of the mountain. Amazing tower. Souvenir shops are available. Enjoyed very much the walk climb from the main road to the top and down the mountain.', \"I though it's just a tower.. You came and take lift or elevator and it has done.. But no...

You do not to need get to the tower too to see fenomenal view. I recommend to go there before sun set to see city during day and wait for sun set to see night view. In the lower level on tower you could find a few place to drink coffee and eat. There is also souvenir shop.', \"This place is insanely picturesque, especially at night. The slopes around it are an easy enough walk if you'reable bodied and remotely fit, the stairs are oddly spaced which makes navigating them more difficult (especially at night) but there's the cable car and buses as well so access is easy.  It's a couples place but groups and singles won't feel awkward. Can get crowded\", 'Iconic tower in Seoul which is good to visit in the evening. You may drive up to a landing area n then hop on a bus for a short ride up to the actual tower entrance. Tickets are required for entrance to the tower itself, however walking around the surrounding area at base of the tower is non chargeable. Do note that it’s best to take the bus down n not attempt to walk down as it can be a rather long dark hike. Upon entering tower entrance a lift would bring one up to the observatory area which is circular so you can view Seoul 360 degrees all round. There are also retail outlets here selling souvenirs, snacks n candy etc. The night view is best as one can see the lights of the city from Namsan Tower. Recommended visit!', 'It leaves me speechless. So beautiful in spring, many people visit this place. Better stay here whole day to maximize your time. Bring your own lovelock and put it in with the other locks. You can also visit the tower to enjoy the view of seoul.', 'I went to N Seoul Tower for free with my Discover Seoul Pass. Has a nice cafe on the observatory floor. Loved the light experience show just before the elevator.', 'Nice observatory to have a 360 view of the city.  I enjoy catching the sunset from here.  Adult ticket prices if you buy from the ticketing office here is 11,000 KRW, I got mine at a discounted price from Klook.', \"Can't really say you've been to Seoul if you didn't go to N Seoul Tower. So did our obligatory visit to this famous landmark. A lot of tourists, but since we visited in autumn, the weather was perfect for strolling around and takig photos of the foliage.\", 'Best possible view of Seoul hands down. Taking the cable car up the hill was very fun as well. Definitely recommend.', 'Going Namsan Tower in winter morning is the right decision. The air is cold but so fresh. View as always pretty amazing. If lucky you can have snow fall here.', \"a must visit place when u're traveling to south korea,, u can take subway, bus, car or taxi to get here.. and u can ride cable car also if u don't want to hike to reach the main location or the top of the tower. i reserved everything for namsan from klook and it's so much easier than waiting in the line..  the scenery was good, there's so many instagramable spots, clean and there's also few shops and restaurant u can buy souvenir and love locks also but the price is really expensive, so better to bring the locks from ur hometown if u want to save more money\", 'Beautiful clean they sell locks in the gift shop', 'Best seen at night when the air is clear, this tower used to be a communication tower retrofitted to accommodate tourists in 2005. Try hiking up to this iconic landmark on Namsan mountain to take in the Seoul skyline. Taking the cable car is a nice alternative but there is usually a very long line and ticket prices are a little high for such a short ride.', 'Too expensive for what it is. The lights inside are overly bright, making it difficult to take photographs at night. The view from the urinal is better than the view from the main deck.', \"This is a must-see in Seoul! It's beautiful during the day and an exquisite view of the city at night. It's a steep walk to the base of the tower but stairs and elevator available once you get to the tower. Great dining and shopping opportunities within the tower. There's a bus stop conveniently at the base of the tower so easy to get to with the bus line. Great views and opportunities to see the tower for free -- you only must pay to see the highest view. The paid view is great, but if you're watching your budget you won't feel left out with just the free views. Loved this!!\", \"fantastic, amazing, awesome place. When you reach the top of this tower, you can see all of Seoul scenery. That's cool. You can also go around this park and sometimes it has a traditional performance.\", 'Super long queue to get on the cable car when we were there around 4pm. I think many want to get on top to see the sunset around 5.30pm in winter. We waited about 45 minutes just to get on the cable car. It cost 9500 KRW for return tickets. After that we have to walk a short flight of stairs up to the tower area. Quite a bit of lighting display of different dinosaurs during Christmas season. We have to pay 10000 KRW for the entrance fee up to N Seoul Tower. And the wait is another 50 minutes before we are being called by our number to go up the tower. After that another 30-45 minutes queue to get on the lift up to the actual tower level. You can see the whole landscape of Seoul from up there but I personally feel there are much more to see with day light. Not able to see the faraway mountain view in the night. There are major cities name printed on the glass panel for you to locate your city. Lots of people up there too so my not be able to get perfect picture of yourself. The queue back down all the way takes even longer than when we were heading up. So be prepared to spend at least half a day queuing just to go up.', 'Fun spot for tourists and locals to take in all of Seoul. The Seoul Tower is an iconic landmark with amazing views of the city day and night. Ride the cable car to the tower or walk up. Next buy a ticket for the observation deck of the tower. Send postcards, take photos, or just have a beer and enjoy the view. Some outdoor areas as well including the very popular love locks. Also for sale too.  Some nice lunch spots as well. A must see for most tourists and a fairly common stopping spot for locals.', \"You have to take bus to go to the Namsan Tower. You never can take the train since the tower is on top of a hill. You can find the bus number and schedules online. Take the bus that take you all the way until in front of the door of the Namsan Tower. The hill is really high up and if you don't want to get tired, really take the bus! Just sit on the bus until the last stop 😁 On top of the tower, there are lots of lovers lock and amazing arcades inside the building. The scenery is really beautiful.\", 'One of the most popular tourist destination in South Korea (seoul) free of charge unless if you want to get on the top of tower this place is also know for lock on the payment Tourist all over the world come here to write their name on the lock and locking it on the side pavement', 'Really live going here on my visits to Seoul. Got a bit lost the time I walked up the mountain to reach it bus stull worth the walk.  Plus you get a nice 360 view from the top of the tower.', \"Enjoyed it a lot. However, services can still be improved. We went there with our 5-month old. We asked where the breastfeeding room is. We were assisted, but I wish the staff could have informed us that my husband and I can go together to the bf room, then go directly to 3rd floor where we will wait for our turn to get on the cable car. I had to go with my baby to the bf room, while my husband had to cue along with the rest. If we were given complete information, we could've saved time. After all, it's a privilege given to us for having a baby in a stroller.\", \"Quite a walk up.  Can either walk up the steps or the road that the cars drive up. Fantastic views at the top.  My second time coming and loved it.  Lots of room at the top to walk around and spend and hour or 2 up there.  The love locks are a cool feature.  It's a must do.\", \"I was sceptical at first on the other reviews but its definitely worth going to visit if you're in Seoul. Fantastic vista of the city skyline, and don't have to pay to go to the observatory to get the views. Lots of places to eat nearby too. Easy enough to get a bus in from the city centre.\", 'There are 2-3 bus lines that go up this hill. But its a nice hour walk up a gentle sloop. Wear nice running shoes for comfort. Beautiful sunrises and sunsets over the city.', 'Must visit if you are going to seoul, it is located to to near Myeong dong subway station. Rather than taking Taxi or any other transportation. Just walk the mountain and enjoy roads.  You must go to observation desk of Seoul tower, from there you can see 360 degree view of Seoul.', 'this place is highest hill in seoul. you can walk alway from metro station and taking the bus. You do not have to take something eat. there is many restaurants and cafe. even local korean beer also. there is a special thing on that. you can buy the lock and hang on the wall and leave the message with your lovers. it will the perfect memorial thing that you can do.', 'You can see the city from the top. You can either walk up to the mountain or right the cable car, 9,500KRW for round trip. There are restaurants, Game Center and other activities.', \"Neat concept but could be better. The lower levels have restaurants but is still being developed. The viewing deck was filled with at least 100 small children on a trip... can't control that. We also went on a cloudy night - the ticket booth warned us before purchase which was nice. The view was really obstructed by the bright lights within the viewing deck. Also seating was limited... which was odd. At least 50% of viewing deck is retail space which made things very crowded. The bathrooms were the best part! If you have time and 10 bucks/ person it's okay. Take the 02 bus there and then start walking up the big hill!\", 'Very crowded on a Friday night, and very humid during summer, but a great experience nonetheless! Took the free \"glass elevator\" up to the area where the cable car is, then paid for a round trip ticket for a ride up (and down) to N. Seoul Tower (also known as Namsam Tower). Minus one star for the fact that if it is crowded, you will be waiting forever to ride the (1) cable car back down. Consider buying a one-way-up cable ticket or just walk it both ways if you are crunched for time.  The views at night were spectacular! Didn\\'t have much time to enjoy anything else, but there was your typical gift shop arrangements and photo areas for your tourists\\' memories. The crowds, temperature, and how much time you have to explore might influence how you will enjoy this place, so please plan ahead!', 'Nice place to visit in evening and at night, you can enjoy sunset and great night view here. And also a romantic place to visit with couples, here got colorful love locks which they believe can stay together with lover forever.', 'Must place to visit in seoul. Best time at night for the night view of the city. Nice views of the city at daytime and easy hike', 'Really fun to visit with kids and a great place to take in the city of your visiting. It can get crowded on weekends, and it can be a bit over touristy. Buy at least the quality of the baubles they sell have improved', 'Great view over Seoul city, you should visit and take the elevator up to the operation deck, it is cheap and  you have such na nice view. There is also a cafe and toilets. N Seoul Tower is hereby recommended!', 'The tower area is pretty small hence you will finish one round of it in a very short time, which is not that worth it for the Cable Car & Tower price. You can skip this attraction unless you have plenty of time as coming here also take effort walking from Myeongdong under hot sun and climbing a few flights of stairs.', \"It's a one of the main attraction in the Seoul city\", 'Beautiful and romantic place for making pledges to each other. Coffee shops aplenty. Nice to get a cable car up great view and beautiful scenery', 'It has beautiful night view, as it is located on a hill, makes the observation deck higher above ground. Perfect place for dating. There are locks sold under the tower.', 'A \"must\" experience while in Seoul.  Namsan Mountain is really the place. The Tower is on top of the mountain.  A great view of Seoul from either the mountain or the tower.  In the fall, the mountain is alive with color. There is also a very good restaurant at the tower top, best experienced at night.', 'Great view, however you are always behind dirty glass, so the pictures you take might not be great. The walk up to the tower is quite nice, and not so tiring (from both sides of the mountain) - this way you can reasonably save a few bucks', 'One of thr best tourist destination in Seoul that you must visit before going back. The views from tower are awesome. Lots of shops can be found on top or at the bottom of the tower too. You can also buy memorable lock to attach to the fences, which is a very popular thing to do.', \"A great and Must go place if visiting Seoul. To ho up there there is a lift, I used it last year but don't remember the price of the ticket. But this year I went by foot and it was amazing. It takes about 30 minutes to climb around 1200 meters of stairs. It is not hard to do and there are places where you can rest and take beautiful pictures. Bring some water for there is water only at the top. The price to enter the tower is 11000 won for an adult and 9000 won for a child (2019 year). There are several restaurants, a gift shop and several terraces where you can take a picture if the entire city. Also if you go wit a loved one you might consider bringing a small lock for the custom there is  people in love to lock it there and leave a small message/promise on it. For me the tower is one of my most favourite places in the city.\", 'N Seoul Tower is the landmark at the heart of Seoul. I was so happy to stay close to Namsan and go hiking every morning.', 'Great view during the sundown and during the dark evening. However make sure to check the smog levels because if you time the wrong day you will barely see anything.', 'This place is easy to get to if your going from Myeongdong. We took one bus for about 20-30 minutes.   No taxis are allowed there.   After getting dropped off,  you walk up the hill to the tower.   There was about 4-5. Floors of stores n restuarnts.   You have to buy a ticket to go up the tower.   It has a nice view of the city. A couples spot.', 'Such an interesting place! There are so many things to explore inside too, and lots of yummy food to eat! I walked down this time and my legs were shaking afterward, but man the views of the city were fantastic!', \"I didn't get to go up in the tower as I was pressed for time, but I did see the surrounding areas and it was just as beautiful. The slant elevator ride to the cable car is so cool and the cable car itself gives a cool view of the Myeongdong area. The view from the surrounding park is gorgeous! A must-see!\", \"Whether you take the cable car or decide to hike up, the views are incredible. You don't even need to go up the tower, but it is a reasonable charge to do so (₩11000).\", 'Amazing view from the tower, and from the way to go here.  The attraction is for free (except if you want to go up to the tower). It is possibile to arrive here by walk or by bus, even by car, and the view (in particular during the sunset or sunrise) is amazing!', 'Great view of the city. Best part was we bought a lock to write on and secure it with the other thousands just like in the k-dramas!  Many shops and places to eat and drink.', \"I was lucky enough to go to the Toronto aquarium,  and that ruined all others for me. This one is still ok, just be prepared it's in a shopping center,  so you can do some shopping after.\", 'Beautiful view of Seoul from the Tower. There are few food shops as well in case of you are hungry. Few souvenir shops but bit expensive than Seoul city. Going up by cable car is a good experience. You will find lots of love padlocks as well which are creating this nice place more lovely. I would recommend this place. You can easily spend 1-2 hours here.', 'It is quite the struggle getting up here, whether you decide to walk up, or shell out money to take the cable car. Once at the top, you have to pay again to take the elevator to go up the actual tower. Unfortunately, the view is not that spectacular due to the smog, but it was still enjoyable. I still really liked the tower because there were a lot of cool displays, restaurants, and stores at the bottom, including a lot of neat LG OLED screen walls.', 'I went up and night and it was beautiful! The lights and bright and colorful and great for pictures. Up there, you could see whole of Seoul lit up. There is also a proposal spot where you could take nice pictures with your significant other. Just a note that it might be slightly colder up there.', 'bought via klook. the queue was too long to take from the cable car station. took us 2 hours to reach the top. would have chosen to take bus up.', 'It is a good place to watch sunset. However, you should be aware to choose transportation or will be ended up like me. Walking 1 hour up hill with quite rough path. I took some photo. Pardon me about the quality since I only use handphone not professional camera.', 'The highest vintage point to view the entire city. It says here that the tower exists in the last 25 years to create beautiful memories, and it is certainly true. It is rather beautiful to get a 180 degrees view of the city in the day and night. Catch the stunning sunset over the west side of the tower on a clear evening; the golden autumn leaves from trees at the summit forms a beautiful contrast over the white skyscrapers of the city below. Lots of eating places at the summit and in the tower, just a tad pricey. Come early in the day or later in evening if you want to avoid the queue.', 'View is really good no matter in day or in night. We arrived there around sunset and stayed till night. It has some restaurants, cafes, shops inside. Kakao friends VR is at 4th floor, we had fun at VR games too. We originally planned to count down 2020 at Seoul tower, but outcome is the last bus from Seoul tower to city departures at 11:30pm. Seoul tower is still worth to come by anyway.', \"It has really great view of Seoul city, it was quite breathtaking but I believe the night view would be stunning. Don't forget to visit the toilet too😁\", 'Very nice walk up to the tower. Good exercise but not the best option if you are not in fair shape. Then the cable car is a better option. The “lock” tradition on the top is not unique but very impressive. The burger place at the top was also very good and with fair prices. Good half day activity.', 'A nice place to enjoy seoul from the top. Unfortunately I came here when the sun almost set so we just enjoy the scenery aroun n tower, enjoying the love lock dock and having a pretty sunset around there. It is really easy to reach here, you just grab bus to namsan and the last stop to n tower, but younhave to walk a lil bit to the place. But eventually when you walk around you will enjoying the amazing view.', \"I'd like to share my experience of visiting Namsan tower. It is located in Yongsan,Seoul. Its admission is free. You go up the mountain or ride a cable car. But you can ride a cabe car only you buy a ticket. You go up the mountain, you can see the downtown of Seoul. Its view is beautiful. If you ever happen to find yourself in Seoul, you might not want to miss this place.\", 'Nice view. Many tourist. If you are first time in Seoul, can take a look. Got to climb a slope up to take cable car up to the hill top. Need to pay for the cable car ticket.', 'Very nice view. Not very expensive. Very good scenery and pictures to take.

Definitely worth a visit if you are visiting the city.', 'Great views of the city', \"Walking up to the tower during the day/evening time and staying until dark makes for a good walk and nice photos in both day and night time. The cable car is cheap if you don't want to walk. The gift shop in the observation deck has nice souvenirs at reasonable prices.\", 'We went at 7pm on a Thursday and it was VERY crowded. Expect to wait an hour to go up the tower (and another hour going down). However it was worth the wait, the city was stunning at night! :)', 'For me, nothing so exciting. Only view is superb. You take cable up to the hill, then if you want to go to the top of the tower for even better view, you need to pay more. But stay on the hill already good enough. There is a shopping mall, and walkway for taking pictures and enjoy the view. Oh...this is the place where lover comes to lock the key, similar idea to a bridge in Paris.', 'The N Tower can be accessed by bus. There is entrance ticket but forgot the price, maybe KWR 10,000++. Do try a game at the observation deck in which you imitate movement and you will get discount voucher for a coffee or beer. Have a cup of coffee (Twosome Coffee) and enjoy the view.', 'A great place you should not miss if you travel to Seoul South Korea. There are different ways you can go to this place.  1. Bus (Namsan 02, 05) - better use Naver Map. For me, this is the most convenient if you want to avoid the long line for cable car. I have tried riding bus going to N Seoul Tower last October 2018.  2. Cable car - worth a try but pricey, expect long linesand crowded.  3. Hike  Love locks are pricey compare to what you can find in Daiso or other stationary shops.  Crowded during the day and less people during night. My first time I went there was last October 2018 and it was morning. Then I visited the place last January 2020 around 8pm.  The place overall is a great one.', 'A very awesome place to visit in seoul. It is very good to visit in spring season. Cherry blossoms give awsome look to that place. Love locks around tge tower make its look more adorable', \"U should prepared for this trip.. it should be your morning itinerary.. because 1. the view is good in the morning..and 2. your leg wil be ready for walk in 45degree high 😂 U should brought your marker from home, because in this place u can't find marker for your padlock BUT Overall this place was nice, especially the view!! 😉\", 'The employee will take you to go the top of tower and you can see beautiful view.', 'The best way to get to Seoul Tower is from Kampung Ku... From here you can get to the Tower by using a cable car. Per pax its only 10k won = MYR 35.00 Its only take 15 minutes from the station to the tower. The scenery is so awesome, the view of Seoul city and you can try your luck by locking it with a pad lock. A lot of souvenirs shop but the price is a bit expensive. If you need a cheaper souvenirs you might visit namdaemun night market.', 'It was the first time to follow an extremely picturesque hiking route up the mountain. And also the first time to visit Nam-Seoul Tower in the evening.  It was breath-takingly beautiful to see it up close lit up at night.  The vibe inside was awesome with the music and all the people on the observation deck. The ladies room toilet cubicle had a window with a view!!', 'I had to wait for an hour to get there with the cable car but it was totally worth it. The place was beautiful with a lot of places to see apart from the observatory deck. Also, the hot cocoa and grapefruit smoothie at Starbucks makes the place look like heaven.', 'From myung dong to here is just a few minutes drive!!! I suggest coming here around 5pm and stay a  few more hours till the sun comes down so you can see the city view at night as well ~~ ( we came early and didn’t catch the night view😕)', 'Here is really famous in korea. If you watch Korea drama, you must know here. Lots of ppls in here and very relax. If you don’t wanna climb the mountain by yourself, you can take the cable car', \"You can ride a cable car for under 10,000 won, or walk your way up the hills. I took the cable car because my feet were sore from walking hours around Seoul, but otherwise I would recommend walking up. You also have to pay to enter the tower itself, in which I regretted for not doing - good excuse to visit Seoul again though! Here you will be able to see more historical sites than at Lotte World Tower Seoul Sky because the latter is within the Gangnam district just across the river.  If you came as a couple you can purchase love locks. There are a few restaurants, cafes and souvenir shops outside of the tower. There's also a Hello Kitty Land, but I'm not sure if you can enter for free.\", 'The tower is located quite far from the main road. You can ride bus just walk to reach the Tower. However, even if you ride the bus, you should do a small hiking to reach the tower. After that you should pay about 15000 won to go to the top of tower building. But, if you just want to lock your love key, no need to climb up to the top of tower building.', \"I don't think it's worth it to go level upstairs because it just for view and it's too crowded and it's pays.  you have to wait for elavator to go up and down because it's so full.\", 'Best view of Seoul 360 is here at the top deck. A sightseeing worth to go if you are in Seoul. Don\\'t forget to visit the \"Locks of Love\" at the stairs of 1F too.', 'A great place to get a view of the city. Do take the cable car to get here especially if you have kids you need to carry or elderly as no car or tour bus can go up to the base of the tower. A challenging short hike a steep hill from where the car/bus stop. To avoid the crowd, go during weekdays. We went in the morning as soon as the cable car started to operate so there was hardly any queue to get on the cable car.', 'Weather good, people friendly and a nice place to visit.', \"You have a 360 degrees view. You can take the cable car to get there or climb the stairs. I would recommend taking the stairs because there is a huge queue for the cable car and the stairs are a great workout. It's a nice view of Seoul from the top, but it's really crowded. However it shouldn't be missed.\", \"Observation tower quite okay but I prefer to go to palace. Maybe this is first and last. My daughter like stay at Hello Kitty island we spend 1H and half here to draw and explore the hello kitty island.its hard to use elevator due to many people want to use it if u bring stroller for baby like us make sure u have patient and if u dont just bring the stroller using stairs 😂 by the way it's good experienced to bring my boy n girl looking what really have in Namsan Tower thanks N Seoul Tower ♥️\", 'A very popular tourist spot, super crowded during high season, famous for love lock area and tower itself. Entry fee is there and it’s a Wheelchair friend, You should definitely go up to the observatory.', 'Nice place to visit with great views. The love locks was cool also. You can go to the love locks area for a great view. No need to pay for observation area.', \"There two routes to take to get to the actual tower, which offers an amazing view of the city in all directions. You can either hike, or take transportation. First route: if you are feeling tired or cannot do the hour long steep hike you can take the express bus that has stops all along the main road leading up to the mountain. I have never taken it myself, but the route involved minimal transfers. Second route: this was the tough route, definitely the much harder one. If you are looking to get a workout in the middle of your trip, look no further. This is it. The trail is very long about an hour of walking up a steep mountain. The trail is very well marked, with paved paths and markers to tell you out far areas of interest were. I'm not sure if it was because I was super tired from shopping most of the morning or hot out, but the trail signs didn't seem to be accurate. The signs would always say something like this: N Seoul Tower, 500m. Here I am thinking okay that's only half a kilometer that not bad but it took me 20mins to walk it. One must understand that I am an avid walker and go on a very difficult steep hike at least twice a year. The hike up Namsan park/mountain was not easy, especially coupled with the stagnant polluted Seoul air, but if you do walk up there are areas you can stop to observe the view you may not be able to get this while on a bus. Occasionally a local ajumma(middle aged auntie) would pass you, all clad in sun visor hat, running shoes, walking stick and backpack running up. This sure gave me the motivation to run up faster. If you are normally not an active person, you may get very sore in the days following this hike. The view at the top is very nice and I mean before you pay to go up in the tower. There is a plaza where sometimes there's an even going on where traditional korean performances take place. There's the love locks fence where couples, would put their name on a lock and put it on the fence, you can bring your own or buy one at the gift shop for about 15,000 won (about 15 US dollars) the attendants all speak a bit of English so even if you don't speak any Korean you would be fine getting by. To get to the top of the tower, there's a fee (I paid 15,500 won which included passes to two exhibits: hello kitty Island and toytopia) I think for regular visits its only 10,000 won (slightly less than 10 USD). All in all, this was well worth the money.\", 'Rode the tram up and hiked down, great photo ops both ways. There were several performances at the top of the mountain, restrooms, and shops.', \"Visited this place for many times already but is the 1st time with my husband ^^ This place is really nice place for sightseeing,  you can walk or go by cable with ticket for cable, the view was really so romantic and lovely for couple, also can do love lock To go to the top of tower need to buy 1 more ticket and go by lift, it's great view cause you could see the view so far from the top The service is so so View, sightseeing 10/10 Service 7/10 Suggest for couples 😅🥰\", 'Good place for tourists to visit but not many options to eat  Also if planning to visit ok weekend be ready for long queue in Bus as well as Ropeway', 'Namsan is a very interesting destination of Korea. Many people come here every day. A special feature here is the love lock - where couples hang and show love. The higher you climb, the more beautiful the view is. The atmosphere is extremely fresh. You can see the city when climbing up high. Although a bit tired to climb, this is worth visiting Namsan when coming to Seoul.', \"My perfect visit to Namsan N tower palace. I'd like to share my experience of visiting namsan N tower palace. It is located in seoul, the capital city of south korea. Nansan tower is located on the mountain, so you have to use bus or Namsan cable car to see the sights. In the Joung sang park located in Namsan N tower, the beacon fire site used during the Joseon Dynasty remains. The view of seoul Namsan tower is refreshing. Because the scenery is beautiful! If you buy a ticket to the observatory you can view it from a higher position. I strongly recommend a visit to namsan N tower. I hope my recommend is helpful!!!! 😃😃\", 'The absolute best view of Seoul. Not for those who are afraid of heights. Tourists should definitely pay to go up to the top at least once, but the free viewing areas at the base of the tower are also very nice.', 'I really like this place, but make sure to use comfortable shoes and spare some energy if you are not used to walk far. If you use dont like to walk, you can use taxi to reach the cable car. If you like to walk, then just walk until you reach the tower and dont use cable car. If you want cheaper, use discover seoul pass or buy it online before. If you like the night view, better to start walk in the evening. The tower color in the night also represent the air condition. If the air is really good, the it would be blue. If the air is good then it would be green. And if the air is bad, it would be yellow and red if its really bad.', 'The path up was a moderate slope but the view was brilliant. You get the whole view of Seoul and there are a few cafe and shops up there as well.', 'The place where we can observe Seoul from the above. Nice view, specially when sunset comes. And forget to bring a lugage lock key to lock your heart to Your Special one. 💚❤️💜♥️', 'Not bad', 'You will love observing and experiencing being at the peak of Seoul. The beauty and the feeling is so mesmerising. From our Hotel,  we took the Gangnam Station Line 2 heading to Badang - change lane to Blue Line 4 to Myeondong exit 7 or 8 and go to bus station and wait for Bus 5 to take you to Namsan Cable Car.', 'Nice to see seoul tower It is not on very bright but you can see seoul city ,small shopping area and photo venice view but from parking you have to walk 0.5km and night - we can enjoy 😊', \"Came here at night to long lines going up, dirty windows to try taking photos through and about s 50 min wait for the elevator down.  To me, the trip wasn't worth the effort. Was sadly disappointed.  Hopefully if you have a day trip it's much better.\", 'Crowded, fun and worth checking out!  I went before sunset on a Saturday.  Super busy, long lines and waiting.  The cable car is large and holds many people. Waited in a long line in the lobby then walked up several flights of stairs with crowds of people.  Arriving at the area of the tower we walked up hill just a bit to the base of N Seoul Tower.  Beautiful sight and lit up during the night. Large space and even with many people the ground area and over look of the city did not feel crowded.  Lots of happy, excited people snapping pics.  Waited in another line to board the elevator to the top of the tower.  Fantastic views of the city, Han River and so pretty with all the city light colors.  Interesting that there is a large candy store selling by the kg.  Then another super long wait in line to catch the elevator back down to ground level and then another long line to catch the cable car back to the car parking area.  Even with waiting in long lines it was fun and worth it.  It was a Saturday evening after all. Recommended.', 'You will never get too old visit the place. Its been so many times which I barely remembered because I was living in Korea once.  Its changed quite a lot...cos its once full of locks much more than the current one. Not allow visitors to throw away locks into the wood, which is a great idea. Weather here is truly nice compared to town. Visit N tower observation point will cost you some bucks. Within the tower also offers foods, snacks and drinks.  Its still one umbelivable landmark in Seoul.', 'Love this place. Second time visiting here and it amazes me. Located in a high hill in the center of city, allows good pictures and knowing people all over the world', 'This is such a good place to have a long and peaceful walk alone or having good conversations with someone else. The view is beautiful.', 'I think this most beautiful place to walk around and enjoy 360 degrees view of Seoul. Observatory was okay, but you have to pay ticket to get in. Instead you can still enjoy the outlook in open air without entering the observatory.', 'Pretty good landscape. Might be able to see North Korea on good weathers.', 'I love coming here. The cable car ride has a nice view, once there you get an awesome view of Seoul, there is coffee shops and the locks along the gates are just so charming', \"It is an exciting place to visit. The view is awesome, and there is no entrance free (But you need to pay if you want to climb the tower). However, it's not necessary to climb the tower, just enjoy the view and fresh air.\", 'A beautiful place! However if you are going with an elderly, please assess whether they are able to walk up steep slopes. If not please try the cable car option.  It was a pity for us as my grandfather is having troubles walking and couldnt go up to the tower.  But a good place to visit!', 'We took Namsan Tour Bus No. 03 to the tower for Won 1200 per adult one way. The view was nice, and the weather was pleasant. There is a variety of eateries from burgers to Korean Noodles.  Nice panoromic view of the city. Be forwarded  that the walk from the bus stop to the tower is pretty steep and more trying on the return trip. Other Namsan Tour buses include No 2 & No 5.', \"If you've been to other high towers before, this will be a similar experience but of course with different panaromic view. You can see the entire landscape of Seoul from the top. Can go if you have an hour or so to spare.\", 'N or Namsan Seoul Tower is a must place to visit when you\\'re in Seoul. Why? First, you get to ride a cable car to reach it. And once there, a few steps up a stair will lead you to thousands of \"love locks\" hanging on the fence and a christmas tree-like contraption.

Fantastic journey and experience.', \"Climbing up the uphill landscape towards Namsan is totally worth every step. It was one of the most beautiful sights that I have ever seen in my whole life. The night lights of the city are like stars that brings everything to life. They carry a vibrancy and serenity at the same time. We were literally huffing and puffing on our way up on a cold and windy autumn night. But all the huffing and puffing didn't really matter when got to take a look of the beautiful gift that Namsan gave us. My sister and I literally just stood in there for quite sometime taking in the magnificence of the view. On our right the Seoul city view and to our left the majestic N Seoul Tower. It was a perfect night to end our first day in Korea. We also got to have a picture where Cha Taehyun posed for a picture for The Seollal Episode in 2 days and 1 night. Fun fact: Our guide told us that if the tower in lit Green meaning the atmosphere is clear of the microdirt and the air is clean. Other colors such as blue and red, indicates a different reading. On our way down, wind blew and ginko leaves fell, adding to the serene ambiance. Definitely worth hiking!\", 'I’ve visited Namsan Tower several times over the last decade, and honestly I think it’s still one of nicest ways to see Seoul from a different perspective! ♥︎  There are different ways to get to the top—you can take the cable car, hike, or if you’re on a budget, take one of the many buses that goes up too!  It’s free to go around the lower deck, there are also lots of souvenir shops, restaurants and food stalls in case you want to purchase gifts or you get hungry.

Cars/Taxis are allowed to reach certain points only. Either you have to walk from there or take bus.', \"The view is definitely something worth checking out at least once during your visit to Seoul! This park is surrounded by nature and it was nice hearing birds singing in contrast to the cars of the city. There are hiking trails throughout the park, a bunch of restaurant, small stands at the base of the tower and even a bus to take you up the big hill. Seems to be popular with couples and families. Even if you don't go all the up to the top of the tower (for about 12,000원 ish) you can still see a lot of the city from the base of it.\", \"Bird eye view of Seoul, 360 degree manner.

The view is great and the surroundings are nicely set to take pictures and walk watching the landscape. Highlight: lunch in the restaurant at the top of the tower. The food was delicious and the view, unbeatable.', \"Great tourist place! Take the tram to the top, there's plenty of places to eat, buy souvenirs,  take photos,  etc. It was cloudy the day we went, so we  couldn't see the lights of Seoul from the observation deck. Definitely visit if you get the chance, and add a lock for your love!\", \"Great view of Seoul from the Tower.  There's also a toy and bear museum here.  Was a little cloudy whilst we were there, otherwise, we has a great time.\", 'Nice overview of the city, but make sure there is a good visibility before going up Otherwise you can just observe from the surrounding park area which is also very nice with great views.', 'I saw many K-drama filming in this place,, most of them are the romatic when (the one i remember the most was boys before flower, when gu jun pyo and geum jan di were trapped in the cable car and found by the janitor staff the next morning),,, me and my hsband are putting our lock in the one of the pine tree,, hopefully our love lock forever like those iron lock,,  this place one of the highlight during our visit in Korea. this landmark offers you with beautiful view from higher place. showing you distance from where you stand and your country, really love this place.', \"The place you can see the view of South Korea from the top of the tower. It's where you and your partner can have a lock-pad together  to show your lover.\", 'Nice views and a fun experience overall because of the added rooms and interest when going up the main tower. Also property in expensive. Just a shame it wasn’t a nice day for me! The way the outside area is lit up at night is nice too.', 'Large tv tower just like in other cities like tokyo,malaysia, etc. You can hike to tower ground or can take a cable car that cost about 8000 won. And if you want to get in tower observation area you must pay more, in the base of seoul tower you can find many love locks, and cafe, also they have beautiful cityscape of seoul down there.', 'Make sure u come here use bus 02 03 or 05. Sometimes google map will lead you use other bus, ignore it. It was nice place to enjoy landscapes of Seoul city from here.', 'Good to go during sunset, can see both daytime and beautiful night time scenes of Souel. May consider to go up by walking and down by cable car', \"Especially the walk up is scenic. Getting up there and having a cold drink and some food while you enjoy the view is a great way to spend a morning. At night I'd take the cable car though.\", 'To have a better tourist experience, take the cable car ride (single route) from Namsan Cable Car for you to save time and effort. Must experience the Observation deck (will require a fee) to have a better vantage point of Seoul. Lovely tower. Lovely view!', 'Beautiful place, the lower deck cable cart line was about 1 hour to wait for, but totally worth it. I would not go up to the tower, the lower deck’s view is already breath taking, and no glass between you and the view, so the photos on your phone would looked better. The restaurants up there however, were slightly overpriced, so we didn’t try them, we came down to the Myeong-dong station with taxi, and had some amazingly delicious Gimbaps instead, and still costed less than eating up on the deck haha That being said, definitely amazing view, must go place, visit after 4pm in summer would be more ideal, because the heat will kill you lol', \"Good view, especially at night. The Tower is located on the hill and first you must hike to the top or just take the cable car. Although, I recommend to take a walk and admire the Seoul's panorama.\", 'watching fall color from top of it was the best part. I would recommend to visit this during fall. also year round views of surrounding seoul city is awesome', 'The view is not that spectacular for that kind of crowd but I guess that is the only place you can get any view in Seoul. The wooden platform was NOT stable, therefore next to impossible take any long exposure night scape photos even if you have the sturdiest tripod in the world, on top of that there will be people constantly pushing you against the guard rail, 100s of people walking around the platform so the platform is constantly moving. Good luck', 'An absolute must on any trip to Seoul. Went up at sunset which was amazing as you see the sun go down and then the city light up. Worth the ticket price to go up the tower and see the whole city.', 'This is the best place in seoul for visiting as foreigner.. namsan tower can be seen from everywhere in seoul.. but if you want to see seoul at one glance go to namsan tower. The best view can be get at night. There are many thing to be entertained here such as alot of restaurants. there is Play area for kids and ery beautiful tarraces to view around. On a lighter not There are so many many love locks are around at every place.. on the reelings, lock trees, lock and locks everywhere. But the best thing is there are many photobooths here. There are 5 floors of the building beneath the tower and every floor have photobooths where you can pay a lil amount and make awesome digital photos. If you want to get the locks, they are available in souvenirs shops located at the place. The best thing about this tower is the lights of it. The tower changes light color according to tge weather. If the air is clean the light will be blue. But the fine dust level is high, the tower lighting will be all in red color. As it is located ob alot hight level on a mountain, There are 3 ways to go up there. First way is having a bus. There are different yellow buses for going and coming back.Second way is to go by cable car (much better option.) So that you can see all around while going up.. Third way is walking to the height. Only if you have enough stamina.. overall its a good place to visit an weekend evening.', \"If you're in Seoul, it's impossible to miss this tower as it's right in the heart of the city. There is no fee to enter the grounds, however, there is a fee to go up to the observatory and to ride the cable car.  Both walking up and taking the cable car has its pros and cons. You get a lovely scenic break from the bustling city if you hike up, but the cable car provides a fantastic view of the city (granted, if it isn't too smoggy). Be aware that lines can be long during peak times!  If you and your significant other are also wanting to lock your love, you can purchase locks on site as well!  If you have the time, go during the day to see all the buildings, the Han river, and trees all around seoul and go at night to get a gorgeous night view!\", \"I love this place as it's really natural. It can only be reached by the cable car. In May 2019, it costs 8500 won for a return ticket. You don't need to pay additional fee but for the cable car only. You might need to consider bringing a jacket, especially if you origin from tropical countries. This place is colder than the big city like Seoul. There are many spots you can enjoy or take pictures so you might want to spend a bit long time here. This is the highest and most panoramic place I visited in South Korea.\", 'I love the scenery. I took the cable car to the Tower. It was quite the hike up. 😄 as the quote say \"the best view comes after the hardest climb\" 😍', 'You can have beautiful views of Seoul city.

A little bit not easy to go up, but it is possible.', 'A must visit on ant trip to Seoul', \"Tourist place that's super crowded during high season. Famous with the love lock area and the tower. You have to pay to get there. And have to pay another extra if you want to get to the tower. We can reach there with elevator and cable car. It's also wheelchair friendly.\", 'As with many places in Seoul its all about being romantic. Beautiful and romantic scenery and at the top theres a few small restaurants, ice-cream parlours and souvenir shops.', \"The view is better at night. Overall experience was okay. There's too many people during our visit which on weekday, can't imagine how pack it can be during weekends. We took cable car (return at 9,500 won per adult) and skip the stairs.  To buy the tickets to the tower, you need to buy at the entrance upon arrival from the cable car. Must include in your visit to Korea. Suitable for couples.\", 'Though we went there during a rainy day, the view is breathtaking on top of the tower.  A  bit of a trivia, the color of the tower indicates the level of the microdust in the area: Good(Blue), Fair(Green), Bad(Yellow), Extremely Bad(Red). We are lucky that day since the color is Blue 😊. For travellers, watch out for this on your visit to N Seoul Tower. Also, around the area, you will see the famous romantic destination of K-Drama, which consist of many love padlocks of couples.', 'Take a ropeway of cost 8000 won to reach at the foot of the tower. After that, you need to give 10000 won if you want to ride top of the tower. The night view is fantastic.', 'It is very nice place yet almost impossible to go by car as you may go untill a certain spot and then have to use bus or hike for 30-40 minutes.', 'It was free to visit the base. Take the cable car (foe a fee) or hike up. Beautiful sceneriea from above.', 'This place are awesome, fresh air and nice view. This is also a icon in Seoul city. Even cable cars are in maintaining, we still can go there by shuttle bus.', 'High point in Seoul with breathtaking views of the whole city. Unique - they point distance of other countries at the observation deck. Stunning views of the bridge and experience was made much more special with photo booth and friendly service.', 'It is a place where every korean drama addict can relate. It is where the famous love locks can be found and the setting of numerous korean dramas. Nonetheless, it is a very beautiful stop while in Seoul. The observatory atop the tower offers a great view of Seoul. There are also restaurants where you can dine after roaming the place.', 'Absolutely astonishing view. Worth walking up on foot, if you have the stamina. The linea for the cable car can be really long, especially in the evenings.', \"This place is one of my favorite places on earth... The atmosphere is full of love, beautiful view everywhere, and there's even great food! You can even buy a lock for you and your significant other and lock it there forever to represent your un dieing love! If you are dating, or married, or even single, this place is awesome for everyone, including kids. I highly recommend coming here!\", 'You can see all of Seoul, some Heongdae, Gangnam. You can huke or take a sky car up. Wonderful.', \"A must if you're in Seoul. Has to be a sunny day. Also recommend going for sunset\", 'We took the bus to NSeoul Tower which was a breeze and took us like 20mins more or less, expect to walk a bit to reach the tower. They also offer cable car ride which leads you to the tower right away, we like the place esp. the lock heart reminiscing BOF Kdrama, place could be crowded and also the keepsakes are bit pricey! Overall good experience! Not much food stalls.', \"Get here via local tourist bus (bus 05 from Myeong-dong exit 3), around ~1100 with a T-money card. Takes about 20mins I think?  We didn't go inside the tower or observatory because the area around the tower already had several observation spots. I guess it also is popular for the younger crowds and couples because of the love lock part of the area.  Must visit to get a wide view of Korea.\", 'Worth seeing Seoul from the top of the tower to appreciate the layout and how large the city is. The walk up is also beautiful, the cake car is also an easier option up there.', 'Most awesome thing to try when coming to Seoul. There are a lot of people from cable car to actually entering observatory but! Totally worth of it. You have restaurants, photoboth inside and can see all of Seoul, I do like night view it makes you feel warm. + You can actually send postcard to your family/friends! And if you have lover you can lock your love and throw key! Totally recomend going! :)', 'Good walk up the hill with nice views from the summit.  Restaurants are available from the peak serving a range of western and lo al food.', 'Missed it my first time in Seoul in 2017 and made a point to visit it this time. Well worth the two year wait! Tip: if it’s cloudy, go hiking in any of the hills and visit the tower when the sun is out. Lots of food and souvenir options. Cable car ride was 9500 Won and the trip to the top of the tower to the observation deck was 11000 Won. Very reasonable! Next trip through I’ll skip the ride and walk up.', 'Great tourist spot, lots too do at the tower base. Not just a boring tower', \"N Seoul tower is The very famous land mark in Seoul. Various pleasures, beautiful sightseeing, many scientific things, everything is amazing. That's it! When you visit in Seoul, please be sure to visit here. You won't be disappointed.\", 'I liked the view from up there and it was pretty amazing since I had never saw this kind of scene in my whole life of living in Korea.', 'Nice views of the city, but really crowded spot, dozens of young couples go here to take pictures in this self-proclaimed romantic love spot. If you want to go up to the tower plan in advance, as queues may be huge, specially at dusk. Several food places (basic quality) and some souvenir shops. You can walk the main road up or go by bus, but the best experience, if you are capable to, is walk up there through the natural park below the tower (bring water and go during day, as the park has no lights at night, around 2km depending on your exact route).', 'The experience of climbing was good with great views and a lot of greenery around. Partial shade as well if you choose to go a bit early before sunset. A lot of stairs but I am definitely not a cable car person. Nothing you havent seen before about the tower though. Having said that, still worth a trip', 'Awesome tourist destination!  Incredible views!  You need to be able to walk up & down stairs.  Food, shops.', 'Quite a touristee park overlooking Seoul; but it is very pretty and there are a few things to see and eat from the base of the tower. At the top there is also an observation deck which is worth visiting.', 'Cool place.  Great exercise getting up and down!  Food was fantastic at the Korean restaurant!', 'Amazing spot for tourists, especially couples who can buy a lock and put it here as a memorable experience. Reading the writing on each lock is fun too! Too bad I wasn’t there on day time, but the city at night looking from the tower is gorgeous !', 'We opted out of the cable car, as we actually bought tickets for the cable car thinking it was the only way up to the tower, and we waited in line forever before we had to leave because we could not wait in the line any longer. We returned the next day by bus, and were dropped off a small hike away from the tower. It was a great experience! You can purchase the locks there if you forgot or did not have the opportunity to bring one.. the price was actually reasonable. The rainbow ice cream was tasty!', \"I took the shuttle bus to the last stop and then walked up. Personally, i figured i would have to walk a great distance at some point, especially after visiting Busan Tower. You don't actually have to pay, unless you want an even higher viewing point. I got there before sunset and it was beautiful. Definitely put it on your list of things to so.\", 'Beautiful views of the city don’t really even need to go up the tower itself as the park at the top of the mountain is also quite beautiful. Gets crowded around sunset but definitely not to the point we felt awkward. Just a lot of people.', \"Definitely don't climb up the trail. Take the cable car it's well worth your money unless you like a physical challenge. Climbing down should be easier though. I did not go up the tower itself as i thought the ticket was pretty expensive. Besides, from the base of the tower you're pretty much higher than the rest of the city anyway. Not much to do up there besides the view.\", \"Taxi driver didn't know he cant drive up, so we walk up the hill. Good experience though as we get to see nature and hikers. Seoul Tower itself is massive and magnificent views all around, plenty of things to do there. Had lots of fun\", 'Must visit.. there’s a lot of stairs, a lil bit tired but after reach the top 👍.. the food, the art, the scenery, the facilities, the crowd, everything was great..', 'This is famous tower in Seoul. I went to this place on Saturday, i was waiting for 1 hour to get in the cable car and another waiting 30 minutes in line to get in elevator to go up to the sky lounge. Then I saw the beautiful night sightseeing in seoul city.', \"Worth visiting at night for the stunning views. Be prepared to either walk up the stairs (very tiring) or you can pay to take the Namsan Cable Car if climbing up hundreds of stairs isn't for you. The wait times were approx 30mins when I visited for the Tower and roughly the same when exiting so be prepared for that. My main gripe were the reflections on the windows from the shop lights which ruined the views somewhat.\", \"The N Seoul Tower or officially the YTN Seoul Tower is symbol of the Seoul city. It is also formerly known as Namsan tower or Seoul Tower. It is one of the best place in Seoul city. Must visit place of Seoul. View from the top of Seoul tower is amazing. Don't miss sunset view. Better to visit at dusk. There are two ways to get to the top. One is cable car and other is just climb it. I prefer second one.\", 'been here many times...but today extra ordinary feelings coz i came with my kids... my kids enjoyed it a lot!!!', 'This place is definitely a must see.  We walked from Yongsan to the tower and had an extremely fun time.  There are many sights, sounds, and tastes to experience along the way like Namsan park, the love locks, and many souvenir shops and restaurants.  The real beauty, however, is the spectacular view of beloved Seoul from the tower.   Take the trip, see the sights, feel the power of the tower!', \"I went there near closing time to see the night lights. It's an okay experience. The price is not so expensive. One  inconvenience at these glassed towers is that it's hard to get good photos. You'll get better photos at the base of the tower. I enjoyed walking down from the tower to Namsan park.\", \"Great place to spend the afternoon/night. It's a perfect place for a date. There are plenty of little gift shops, eateries, and even an arcade with a kpop photo booth. They also have a love lock area and you can pick one up for 10000₩ (about $10 USD) or you can be frugal and pick one up at Daiso. Don't forget a sharpee! When we went they had a small drum and martial arts show. They even had some of the audience participate. Overall the view is amazing and there are plenty of different activities to keep you busy. We had a lot of fun.\", 'Visited the Seoul Tower with my family and it is truly a majestic place to visit! I was in awe when we we went to the top via cable car! You cannot miss this whenever you visit the lovely country of Korea!', 'It worth visiting due to scenic view of the city. Spare some extra time on holidays due to crowd.', 'A must visit place when in Seoul. Best time to visit is during evenings. Cool breeze with perfect lighting. Love locks all around to make this place special. To go on the upper deck,  you have to pay around 11000 KRW,  this is after paying around 95000 KRW to reach at the tower.  A bit costlier,  I must say. A worth visiting place', 'The tower is on the top of a large hill which gives you the best views of the city, but can be a bit of a hike up many, many stairs so the cable car is recommended. However the views from the top are totally worth it!', 'Come here when the end of winter, i dont recommendation because the wind sooooo bad 😭 but definitely will come here again if i visit Seoul next year', 'Amazing view and well connected, with multiple buses coming and going.

A special place for sure.', 'Beautiful view even in the foggy night. Plenty of food and shopping. The lift is not private so be aware when you want to have time alone with your friends or date.', 'Overly crowded at any time of day. Only one exit elevator, so good luck if there’s a fire. Waited more than 1.5 hours in line to get out.  All smudge marks on windows. No one cleans them.  You can have nice views of city without going to the top. Once you get to the tower bottom views are amazing.', 'Good touristy views and was not busy on a weekday. Good price of KRW26,000 for 2 tickets to the observatory, 2 beers, and large popcorn Other exhibits such as hello Kitty museum are extra.', 'Great views and places to eat and little shops at the top.', 'Excellent place to visit.  Great scenic view of the city.  The light show before entering into the Observatory was superb.  It was a time well spent.  The Love locks locked onto the gates were also a cool sight to see.  Mwah!!!', \"A romantic place, especially if you visit it in the evening with a special someone. If you're healthy enough, you can try to climb to the tower on foot from the base (car entrance). My wife and I followed the trail all the way from the opposite Namdaemun Market, and we made it to the Tower in one and a half hours. But the scenery you enjoy up here was worth the efforts.\", \"It has a nice 360 view of Seoul city. The buffet restaurant at the 3rd floor os pretty good, but don't set your expectations too high. To reach the tower from the car park/bus stop is quite steep, esp. for little kids or elderly.\", 'I really enjoyed the views and area around the tower, everything is spacious and well organized. Highly recommended for anybody visiting Seoul for the first time, expectacular views of the city from its heart at Namsan Mt.

If you visit it, don't stop by the tower only. You can enjoy other facilities such as 360 degrees experiences, 4D theater, game center, etc. All of them are free for foreigners (once in a lifetime) but not sure for local citizen.\", \"It was amazing seeing Seoul city from the top of the observatory deck. Easy to access, you can find many transport options to go there. I think it's best to visit at the evening.\", 'Best views of the city. Nice place to take photos of Seoul from a high point.

There is also a cable car that take you to the highest part while enjoying the views.', 'One of my favourite attractions in Seoul. You will not regret a trip to the tower. Four storeys of dining and arcade games will help keep you entertained. Access to the tower itself is 10,000krw and can take up to 30min in line during peak times (queue down is very long so please allow time). The tower has two observation decks and a cafe. There are great photo opportunities but note that the insurmountable Skyline is impossible to capture in one photo!

It is always very windy up there.', 'Astonishing view of the City from the Observatory deck. We went at night time and would like to come back during the day.
