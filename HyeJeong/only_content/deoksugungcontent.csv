0,One of the most symbolic historically meaningful palaces of the country Superb access by public transportation and highly walkfriendly Youll feel a hyperreal serenity at this place which magically fades out the citys bustle and takes you back to the time
1,Would have put a five if the MMCA museum was opened But it was closed for renovations Overall a nice place to walk around and sit to enjoy the good weather we are having in Seoul now
2,I had an incredible day walking around the palace Its beautiful to see all the people in traditional dress to take pictures
3,Very nice palace in a huge space near center of Seoul Cheap entrance fee 1000 KRW Clean toilet
4,The entry tickets are only 1000 Won so its definitely worth a visit 1 Its open until late in the evening but if you get there past 1630 or 17 pm there are no english tour guides available And without a tour guide you cant visit one of the museums inside Fortunately the information signs for the different locations are also in English  2 A lot of the previous buildings of the palace area were destroyed You also cant enter any of the remaining ones  3 Definitely a spot to take great photos at 
5,This is a must visit location stunning and so wellmaintained artifacts and buildings so homy they hadhave underfloor heating you would like you could live there
6,I took a walk in Deoksugung palace There were many people taking pictures and there were foreigners and visitors wearing Korean traditional clothes There was also a space where I could appreciate works of art but I should take off my shoes to enter It felt more like a wellmaintained park than a palace
7,This is a very beautiful place to see A blend of history and nature surrounded by a great modern city
8,This is where history and modernity meet Inside the palace grounds are also Western architecture buildings In addition even the stone wall around it is famous and was featured in KDramas such as Goblin This palace also  holds a Changing of the Royal Guards Ceremony which is free of charge even passersby can watch it   This is near other tourist destinations such as Cheonggyecheon Stream and more So might as well fit this in your itinerary  Read more on my blog at sophiaorlanesblogwordpresscom  Note Went here in December 2019
9,Another great cultural institution in Seoul Loads of beautiful and interesting buildings well maintained
10,A beautiful and peaceful palace right across the city hall You can even see the changing of the guards for free at certain times everyday
11,CMMA museum has excellent history foe Art a must visit while in Korea
12,This is the smaller of the two palaces Deoksugung Palace offers a rich history of its protected grounds Beautifully maintained this Palace is a great place to bring the family
13,This place is so calm  peacefully I wanted to make meditation when i walking around
14,as a tourist you should definitely visit the palace  It is very beautiful and its design is similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing The changing of the guard that takes place at the gates of the palace is also very beautiful  it is definitely worth visiting there
15,A beautiful palace that is perfect if you do not have a ton of time but still want to see part of Koreas history
16,Traditional and modern palace in South Korea Othoniel was been there 
17,If you come during the changing of the guard then you can watch the changing ceremony and take pictures with the soldiers in uniform from the Joseon era
18,Its such a beautiful palace with plenty of areas to walk around Its not as big as some other palaces but its definately a place i recommend I went Wednesday not realizing that the last Wednesday of every month is Culture Day which means its free admission day
19,Historical area in the middle of modern architecture It was so amazing being there For me sunset is the best time to visit Deoksugung Be aware that the temple closes at 9 pm
20,Another option to visit when youre in Seoul They have a mini art exhibition at that time when I was there and it was fun to see the modern art with traditional background Over all the place was less crowded and good for an afternoon stroll Its a smaller area compared to the other palace so you wont find that much to explore here but it is still nice for a visit
21,Nice Tourist place since there are not so many tourist you can discover it more indepth and take a few pictures without them It is also very interesting since here not only the old style but also the new style is present This place is interesting because here the western and the eastern world came together
22,Yey for the free entrance on lunar new year They put classic Korean games inside where anyone is allowed to enjoy The temples like most of them were amazing to see One thing unique here is the stone buildings Make sure to visit the displays inside
23,Deoksugung Palace is virtually two palaces in onea Korean traditional complex blessed with numerous examples of lateJoseon palace architecture and a Westernstyle palace complex comple with two imposing neoclassical structures and Koreas first Westurnstyle garden
24,One of the most beautiful palaces in Seoul Also there is a national museum inside The spacious palace makes me feel calm and peaceful I could talk and walk much with my family with enjoying my countrys traditional buildings and views 
25,Its such a beautiful place I fully recommend going if youre ever in the area Its 1000 entry fee and you can spend however long you like there The juxtaposition between the old and the modern is amazing to see
26,Love this Deoksugung Palace that is in the heart of the city and a strong 5 Star to the management for preserving this heritage Amazing to see the old historical site and sight vs the new development side by side Thrilled to see the beautiful architectural design and structures of roofs rooms walls and buildings Great to witness the upkeep of tradition with the old costumes worn during their ceremony performed Love this place
27,An underrated historical sight in Seoul Perfect for a stroll Spring and autumn are the best periods to visit
28,For a different and peaceful experience visit this sight in the evening Theres practically no one around and the buildings take on a different character when illuminated with the light Absolutely stunning regardless what time of the day but extra Magical when you can enjoy at your leisure without the hordes of tourists
29,amazing place worth of spending 2 hours here even just walk around tradition shows take place every day and local guide Even most of the palace are burned into ashes the remains are still amazing Check wiki or whatever in your hand to explore the history of this site in advance
30,Interesting historical place to be visited in Seoul Located in the heart of Seoul you will find a little serenity in crowd You can look back and learn from the shades of Korean past life What makes this place unique is you can find the contrary view between Koreanstyle building opposite to European one But there is no prayer room provided here So its less visitor friendly especially for Muslims
31,Quite a small palace but the history behind it is interesting its very quiet and peaceful and only 1000 for a ticket so its very reasonable  We arrived just before 11am and they were doing the changing of the guard ceremony and afterwards there were photo opportunities with the guards  There was a great contrast between old and new architecture as well
32,Great spot in the heart of the city Despite its location it seems to be one of the least busy of the palaces in Seoul Its not as big as Changdeokgung or Gyeongbokgung but its very pretty and worth a visit Very peaceful place
33,It is always a classic for every cities around  the world to have the privilege of having a palace be it just a monument to a historical significance or otherwise  It will always has a drawing magnet for bringing tourists and even city residence to relax and feel a sense of tranquillity amidst the lush landscape both hard and soft
34,Maybe my favorite palace in Seoul Great memories of visits on October evenings 
35,This place is really fantastic There isnt only hanok a traditional Korean House there is also some English style buildings
36,One among five palaces in Seoul built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty There are buildings in traditional Korean style but also National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art I would recommend to see the change of guard
37,The only palace with western style architecture inside and a very interesting history You can also watch Changing of the Guards at the Daehanmun gates just outside at specific times of the day As with most sites in Seoul theyre closed on Mondays City Hall is just across the road and if you walk along the walls to the left facing of the gates you can reach the Blue House and some very weird statues too
38,Deoksugung also known as Gyeongungung Deoksugung Palace or Deoksu Palace is a walled compound of palaces in Seoul that was inhabited by members of Koreas royal family during the Joseon monarchy until the annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910 It is one of the Five Grand Palaces built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty The buildings are of varying styles including some of natural cryptomeria wood painted wood and stucco Some buildings were built of stone to replicate western palatial structures  In addition to the traditional palace buildings there are also forested gardens a statue of King Sejong the Great and the National Museum of Art which holds special exhibitions The pathway along the palace fence is a beautiful treelined road including ginkgo trees and is famous for dating couples The palace is located near City Hall Station
39,This a more modern palace It opens more hours so you can go later in the afternoon
40,Smaller palace but more different rooms to see  Better than three nigh palace which has lots of buildings that all look the same and have nothing to see inside them  Its free to get in
41,A small palace considering its size but it also houses a British residence and an art museum within it All of them were pretty nice The British residency tour needs to be booked and the museum ticket is also charged separately
42,Costs 1000krw to get in or free if you wear the traditional clothing If you buy the multpass for 10000krw you get tickets for many more Very quiet and peaceful area to walk around and appreciate the buildings and gardens Has an art Musuem also which is 2000krw to enter Time it right and you will get to see the royal palace guard changing and get a photo with the guards
43,One of the Palaces in Seoul that opens till abit later than others Great place for scenic walks and photographs Entrance for 2 adults  2 child is only 3000Won Very relaxing place Recommended Take the public train only 4 mins walk
44,Let me just say the surrounding of the palace at fall time like this makes pretty pictures The palace is smaller than Gyeongbok and less famous Being less famous means less tourists here but its  still a pretty palace complex with buildings from different periods The one thing this palace has that others dont is the changing guard ceremony The one I saw took place at around 4 PM
45,a great place to spend an entire day relaxing or walking around while looking at beautiful historical buildings and various artmuseum exhibitsespecially during autumn when the colorful leaves are just stunning
46,The place is definitely worth visit You can sense the tradition there There is good information available for tourists about the history of the place
47,Very good palace  However the size is small compared to other places Deoksugung palace was first used by king seonjothe 14th king of the joseon dynasty  while he was in exile during the Japanese invasion of korea in 1592 when he used the house formerly occupied by the descendants of prince wolsan as a temporary palace
48,Nice palace Less crowded and good opportunity to know about Korean history in midst of city location Easy access via train Also worth a stroll around surrounding area to get a feel of day to day life of people 
49,Definitely worth stopping by on your way through the city center Beautiful Westernstyled garden an ideal place to relax in this big and rushed city
50,Beautifull place and full of history you can choose many photo spot because theres too many and all of them beautifull You can get free entry access if you use the traditional Korean costume
51,Very reasonable entrance fee Palace is small s ale and quite empty Mostly in Korean Not very interesting Im afraid The changing of guards at 2pm was nice Be careful of the protests outside the main gate Riot police too
52,Loved it Also I was fortunate enough to spectate ceremony of some kind which was super fancy and exciting At the end the guards gave everyone an opportunity to take a photo with them That was very cool
53,Lovely place with a mixture of European and Asian architecture Everyday there are guard performances right in front of the palace The palace is full of beautiful trees that bloom in the fall and spring which makes this palace even more beautiful I highly advise to join a guide who can tell you in detail the history of the palace
54,Few confusions while buying the entry tickets to the palace Price list says 1000 and 10000 wons for royal palace Which we thought it will be inside  But the ticket is to visit 4 palaces which is located around the city Anyhow the ticket is valid for 2 months so no worries Coming to the palace little disappointed for not having any info about the palace or buildings  We can read only msg Like do not enter Apart from that palace good nice and old Palace represents a mixture of Korean and western culture
55,Deoksugung is one of the Five Grand Palaces of the Joseon Dynasty located next to Seoul Plaza and City Hall in the city centre Note the palace is closed on Mondays  This palace served as the residence of the Royal family twice during late 16th century and then again at the turn of the 20th century providing well preserved buildings of traditional Korean and Western architecture  Here you will find a collection of traditional Korean style entrance gates lovely inner courtyards worship and residential halls pavilions and landscaping all quite similar to what you see at the much larger Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces You can also watch Changing of the Guards ceremonies here at Daehanmun Gate  Two unique inclusions at Deoksugung include the Western style buildings at Seogeodong Hall which was built in European style in 1910 and the adjacent building used to house the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art MMCA  Deoksugung branch  One of the things we very much enjoyed about visiting Deoksugung during the autumn was the fantastic fall foliage display seen throughout the palace grounds There were numerous spots where we found multiple colours of tree leaves that made for lovely photographs The autumn scene here was considerably more impressive here than at other palace grounds visited during this trip to Seoul  We were however disappointed to find the MMCA Deoksugung Art Museum closed during the time of our visit There was no indicated closing on the MMCA or Deoksugung websites nor at the place entrance which was odd  Overall we quite enjoyed spending time at the Deoksugung Palace Not only was it exceptionally beautiful this time of year but we found it more management a place to visit compared to larger palace grounds around Seoul You can comfortably browse Deoksugung in 3045 minutes or longer if you want to visit more leisurely This is a very good and cheap attraction visit to consider making during trips to Seoul

66,Small and underrenovation at a few zone An hour at this spot is just a right time Though the stonewall walk path is beautiful decorated from the palace
67,Deoksugung palace is unique among the many palaces i visited in korea because of the harmonious mixture of western and eastern architectures It is also best to experience the change of guards ceremony at around 23pm in the main gate although entrance may cost you around 1000 won

69,Beautiful beautiful palace Continued restoration and recovery work makes this place even more meaningful You can see change of the guards at specific times Also walk along the stone wall outside of the place is wonderful activity to do

204,If you want a quick stroll to history and to follow steps of queen and king The best thing about this small  palace is that  you can see the separate houses Jeon in koreanfrom 500 yrs old to 1919 when the real last emperor of Lee dynasty Kojong struggled to hold evetything that was falling apart rapidly by foreign imperialism power that shattered  country  asleep for 500 yrs
205,A photogenic place good for tourists to visit  experience the history they got both the eastern  western architectures here I went here in the evening and the lights here at night are pretty nice still good for the photo shoot A beautiful place
206,Culture arts and even a mini concert
207,Can see the influence of the western culture in some of their building Not a big place so can finished the whole place in less than an hour if you really take your time to walk around and takes pictures Lots of trees and I believe it will be fantastic view when all the cherry blossom bloom at the same time
208,Beautiful palaces right in the heart of Seoul If youre looking for a less crowded and more peaceful experience of a Korean palace then this is the one for you Even though situated in the centre of the city the complex is calm and tranquil with a lovely congrats between the skyrises and traditional homes Well worth a visit if you have time Access from City Hall metro station
209,The palace area was beautiful The tickets cost only 1000won that day but I know that if you rent and wear a Hanbok traditional Korean outfit then entry is free Operating hours 09002100 and its closed on Mondays
210,Its really nice The old korean architecture with a small mix of western influence Then there is also a museum Entry is 1000won Its also nice for an afternoon date
211,guide tour at night was good
212,Amazing place I was there in autumn and you could take really nice pictures also good for walking It totally worth the entry fee which is for foreignersnonKoreans were 1000 won about 4 There is a small pond located in the palace complex without the massive number of tourists one can easily feel the ancient Korea
213,A beautiful palace Huge place to get lost and relax
214,It was a very interesting place  I have seen many palaces before but the booth outside letting you try on the traditional clothes for free for 3 minutes really impressed me  There was also a changing of the guard ceremony that was interesting
215,They had local volunteer guide which was so nice to explain the history about the place
216,A smaller palace in the middle of town Well worth a visit especially if you take the free guided tour about 50 minutes Time your visit to see the changing of the guard which is quite entertaining
217,Nifty little palace in middle of downtown We got free tour from a local Korean girl in middle school who was super nice  Interesting history  She told us it was once a zoo for short while  Doesnt take long to walk around  Worth checking out
218,These days the Korean royal family is no more than a symbol of the glorious Joseon dynasty charged with the role of promoting tourism Deoksugung really is a remarkable palace not only because it has survived in one spot for 400 years although greatly reduced but because it is so well preserved cohabiting with the many skyscrapers and hustle bustle of down town Seoul The inside of the roof is incredibly ornate and the dragons standing watch over the gate are a highlight The ancient dress uniform of the Korean soldiers manning the gate have to be seen to be believed Worth an hour of your tourist time Deoksugung is the smallest of several palace complexes in the Korean capital
219,This is one if the smaller palaces but probably the most interesting and good for tourists short on time It has ancient Korean style buildings and a historically interesting western style palace as well The best part is the inclusion of a modern art museum which holds special exhibitions of Korean art
220,Huge area Only 2 area of toilet Quite and beautiful
221,If you had to choose a season for visiting there it must be the autumn  fall Everything is just so beautiful and the pictures comes out so well

246,A place where you can feel traditonal Korean palace Though its located at the middle of Seoul once you go in there you can feel the quiet and peaceful atmosphere National Museum of Art is also located here so it would be great to visit the museum also

259,I enjoy watching the changing guard ceremony Its old korean culture The changing guard ceremony is at 2 o clock in front of the gate It happen about 1 hour This event should be on must see list during your journey to korea The palace is very nice during cherry blossom time because there are too many cherry blossom around the palace area Even the korean people like to visit the palace during cherry blossom

324,Touristy  people dressed in Chosunera dress demonstrating various court activities that would have occurred hundreds of years ago including the receiving of emissariesnotices and changing of the guards It makes a lot of noise and I suppose is worth a few photos but becomes a nuisance to those who work nearby
325,True beautiful place around the skyscrapers Right near seoul city hall and galleries you can take a rest in this calm and neat nature
326,It is a smaller palace but what is great about it is the guard change ceremony which is really impressive and colorful and also has explanations is several languages You can also try on a guard costume

330,The palace guard ceremony was very nice and can even take pictures I rate the place 5 stars It was a nice experience
331,Quaint small palace right next to city Hall Definitely worth the detour if you pass by there Ii went in the spring but it must be stunning in the winter as well
332,Extensive complex of mainly single storey dwellings rather predictably of crude timber working and even less finesse in the connecting courtyard stone slabs These being extremely rough and uneven serving as a reminder of how prudent one was in taking travel insurance Trekking shoes a must Intricate painted patterns and motifs related to the past culture worked in the interior ceilings and external buttresses executed with low durability paintwater based   Exhausting walk of much the same No evidence of cavalry stabling or food growing patch  Alleviated by enormous GrecoRoman stone buiding by western know how and furnished by Maples of Londonat the time the global source for opulent furnishings The building itself is not open to the public just a basement section on Daehan Empire  Adjacent is another western building requiring ascending steep shallow stone steps to enter National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Artyet anotherDeoksugung location Here an interesting collection The Arrival of New Women  early 20th C pioneering artists both visual and performance surprisingly mainly trained in Japan during the occupation years and some fled to Shanghai or the then Soviet Russia Some very endearing phonograph songs  Take note the scale of Seoul is enormous and the walk back to the metro stop City Hall can be agonising   more anon  ngmingsphere
333,One of the big 5 old palaces in capital city of Seoul that has been existing for more than 600 years since Chosun Dynastys foundation in 1392 right after the collapse of  Koryo Kingdom that same year DUCKSU Palace is located just across the street from Seoul City Hall and also from the Plaza Hotel Seoul The sight you should never fail to see is the changing ceremony of royal guards that takes place in front of the main gate at 12 oclock noon from Monday to Friday
