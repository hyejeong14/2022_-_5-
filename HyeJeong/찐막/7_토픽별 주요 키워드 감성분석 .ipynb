      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "it is better to use cable car to go up there because walking is not suitable for oku old folks less exercise people the way to reach n seoul tower is too deep unfortunately the day i reached n seoul tower the cable car is on maintenance so we need to go up and down by foot luckily the weather is good and cooling the scenery is undoubtable and very nice one thing that need to take note is to reach the observatory floor there is only one lift and the only way to go there please queue at the right floor as we experienced queueing at 2 floors but the lift isnt stop and always full to advise just wait at ground floor the love locks area is full and we decided not to lock because seems no empty space to put on it the view from top is very good worth to pay a visit\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "huge disappointment went to the cablecart to get there but it was closed due to strong winds st happens so we had to take the bus the line for the bus was massive took 60min of waiting after the bus drive headed to the tower took the elevator up collected our tickets and was informed that there was another 40min wait before we could take the elevator up to the observation deck after the 40min wait you take the elevator up to a room with 360 projectors showing random animated movies on the walls to distract you from the 30min addition waiting time here when you finally reach the observation deck you can barely see out the windows as the lights from all the souvenir shops there are reflecting in the glass as a result of this the windows were full of finger prints and nose prints from people trying to see anything and the windows werent cleaned after this disappointing experience we decided to head out again only to find another 30min wait to get down   summary of time waste bus 60min entrance 40min entrance 2 30min exit 20min  spend your time on something else\n",

      "we went up by cable car and when we arrived we found the whole area looked very dated admittedly there are very good views from the top of the tower but we thought there are much better places to visit than here unless youve got plenty of time in seoul by all means go and have a look but ensure the skys clear because youd only go up there for the views the tower itself and immediate surrounding areas are a little underwhelming and that includes the hello kitty island experience which i can only recommend if you are a diehard hello kitty fan even for the likes of us who find hello kitty quite cute it was not worth our time\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "the smooth safe ride up love locks beautiful views of seoul city and an experience a lot like teamlab borderless in japan once you go in to the tower its on a much smaller scale than the teamlab borderless one but amazing nonetheless you will have to pay more to go up but so worth it the observation views are gorgeous and you really get a unique view of this special city theres even a post office box up there that you can send postcards to the usa and other countries from great experience\n",

      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "we took the bullet elevator all the way to the observation deck and it lasted only 38 seconds or less one would hardly feel it because theres a video showing on the ceiling while its going up the best part of being on the observation deck is the ladies comfort room one wall is entirely made of clear glass and youll see seoul while you use the commode weird but great experience we were also able to do the lovelocks and it was fun\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "ive been here twice once in the evening and once in the day from the entrance to the tower you can appreciate the cityscape of seoul and its a great view it doesnt cost much to go up the tower only 10000 krw per person plus there is a bundle of 2 popcorns  2 beers for 26000 krw which we availed of the top of the tower itself was quite small in terms of circumference only housing a candy store and a souvenir shop were located at the main viewing deck with a nonadvertised coffee shop at the lower floor which we wouldve gone to and stayed at if we had only known theyre the only accessible nonrestaurant establishment with seats it was a great experience but its more than enough to go up the tower once no need to do it again and again\n",

      "it was a great experience going up the n tower this time in a car instead of the cable car it was certainly a different view as i recall 10 years ago the inside of the tower is slightly different to what it is today for example 10 years back there was no led tunnel at the entrance the entrance is unique the tunnel is made of led panel that plays 3 different videos it started with seoul city universe or nebula and followed by marine lives all different video gives one different feeling as you walk through it my favorite so far is the marine life video\n",

      "your basic tower experience a zoomy ride a full round view and snacks and souvenirs for those who want since the tower is already on a hill it does get up there and you can se for miles the windows are kept clean for photos at the base there are some zero dollar view points and more kitsch we also rode the cable car to the base and added feature\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "its my second time here my first time was over 20 years ago it is an awesome place offering great views of the city it was very crowded this time round with long lines snaking up the stairs leading to the cable car boarding station the boarding process could be done better and safer in my opinion like having a holding area with set number of people held in a room or something safer instead of having people stand in long lines along the verona stairs which i consider as a potential safety hazard overall a memorable experience and brought back seeet memories when i was younger then  would have given 5 stars if not for the excrutiatinf long wait times snaking up various stairways hope the boarding process will improve another thing is when u buy food or snacks i was not able to find a trash can\n",

      "romantic place to be if youre a couple a gondola ride up to almost the peak would be a fast way to reach the top remember to bring a colourful padlock along too to lock up memories of your visit there overall a lovely experience indeed to take a walk along the grounds there in nice cool weather and superb views once up the tower also visited the hello kitty museum at the base of n seoul tower and it was as pretty as can be hello kitty\n",

      "its just a big tower to look at seoul from above but it lacks a character and kind of soul that similar towers in other places have  eiffel ostankino pearl tower taipei 101 cn of toronto sears seattle tower gave me a much more powerful experience important hint dont go for a airtrain that brings you to the foundation of the tower  use the stairs considering the long lines it is much faster\n",

      "i realize that kdramas gave me illogical expectations for this place i blame do min joon  i liked the exercise of the trek up the hill towards the cable car station the cable car experience my first was like standing in the mrt during rush hour though the view below is beautiful so find a good spot near the glass we went and paid the krw9000 to go up the observatory but it was disappointingly small compared to those in macau and shanghai it was an unnecessary expense personally i think an hour roaming around the love lock platforms and watching out for free outdoor shows would be enough might have been a better view of the lights if we went at night but then it would be hella freezing\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "something you should do in every city is to go to the highest peak point to have a overall look of the city  n seoul tower is exactly the place to do that  quite cold  breezy during the winter and chilling like any other place in seoul  the cable car comes quickly however it is not the usual small cable car with seats it is of the larger ones where a lot people gets packed into it in a standing position  theres food available around the tower and also the famous lovelock thingy  the tower itself however is quite small and the overall place will take less than an hour to be fully explored  the walk from the nearest subway station to the cable car station is quite tedious youll have to do some 1530 mins walk depending on your speed and climb some slope while doing it throw in some 5 degree celcius winter breeze then youll have some unpleasant experiences\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "although i usually avoid tourist attractions when traveling this particular one turned out to be a good experience the tower is located in a nice park and a cable car takes you right up to the lookout platform there is some climbing involved so wear comfortable shoes while we were there there was a cultural performance that was entertaining there is also a gift shop inside with some nice souvenirs the best part however is the spectacular panoramic view of the city be sure and visit on a clear day to take full advantage of this birds eye view\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "i chose the walking route to get to the top of this tower the other option is the cable cars which i did not experience  it took around half an hour to walk to the top from the taxicoach dropoff point and there are various stopoff points along the way where you can enjoy the view  at the top are various cafes and places where you can buy padlocks and plastic to write on you will realise why when you get to the viewing area  the location is very popular with couples who write love messagesletters on their padlocks backs of phones or anything they can find really and chain them to a fence of alreadyfilled love messages\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "the tower is at the base of namsan one of the small mountains encircling the northern historical part of seoul there is the cable car for the unfit or lazy and also a delightful walk up the hill on a good day when the carbon monoxide is not in play there must be tremendous views in any event the experience is well worth the cost of getting to the summit free for walkers but otherwise 8 for the return cable car ride  at the bottom of the hill there is myeongdong for the shoppers and close by namdaemun market a maze of narrow shopping streets best explored on foot  taxidriven tourists will gain nothing from the experience\n",

      "we took the bullet elevator all the way to the observation deck and it lasted only 38 seconds or less one would hardly feel it because theres a video showing on the ceiling while its going up the best part of being on the observation deck is the ladies comfort room one wall is entirely made of clear glass and youll see seoul while you use the commode weird but great experience we were also able to do the lovelocks and it was fun\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "ive been here twice once in the evening and once in the day from the entrance to the tower you can appreciate the cityscape of seoul and its a great view it doesnt cost much to go up the tower only 10000 krw per person plus there is a bundle of 2 popcorns  2 beers for 26000 krw which we availed of the top of the tower itself was quite small in terms of circumference only housing a candy store and a souvenir shop were located at the main viewing deck with a nonadvertised coffee shop at the lower floor which we wouldve gone to and stayed at if we had only known theyre the only accessible nonrestaurant establishment with seats it was a great experience but its more than enough to go up the tower once no need to do it again and again\n",

      "entering the structure through a led tunnel was amazing going up the observatory through the elevator was an experience itself with the short video clip watched on the elevator ceiling the whole of seoul can be seen at every level of the tower but best at the observatory and even through the bathroom a mustvisit place in seoul\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "we went at 1015am just after the 10am opening time the tower was still fairly quiet no queues and we enjoyed the view having said that the experience is quite cheesytouristy eg the animated video played in the elevator and you still get really good views from the park at the bottom of the tower because of these points i dont feel like this is a mustdo and i wouldnt recommend it if you have to wait in line\n",

      "not too bad of a view up there but we realize without paying for the observatory deck the deck below where all the locks are do have a nice view the wait to head up was crazy we were told to come back 2 hours later but thank god we bought a package with the sensory experience and could head up the observatory right after heading up to this place was quite a chore we had to wait an hour or so for the bus to travel up and down heard that the waiting time for cable car was worse the frequency of the buses were slow would suggest them to have a shuttle bus specially dedicated for visitors even if it means charging rather than having to take a public bus and to impose on their locals who merely want to take a bus from one point to another actually another good place to see the view of seoul would be seoul sky tower that is newly opened and more accessible\n",

      "i believe it is a most visit place in seoul  i love how it is located at top of mountain very beautiful views at the way to tower very green forest and i saw many people hiking to the tower the ticket is not experience and there are many good romantic places that lovers would love to see and leave some memories for example writing on walls hanging locks also many shop stors that offer beautiful souvenirs but they are expansive also there are areas for children to play\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "i just returned from the tower after not having known what to expect id be underselling the experience if i didnt say it exceeded my best expectations ive really grown to love korea and plan on visiting again in the near future the park itself is immaculate with well maintained trails that are somewhat physically taxing but the average person will be just fine there are also cable cars for those less inclined to get to the top on foot halfway up the trail youll find a few places to grab a few items to both eat and drink the view gets increasingly more beautiful as you climb with the top offering a spectacular and unobstructed view of beautiful seoul youll find plenty of options for both food and drink at the summit and tickets to the observation deck are moderately priced there is a quaint gift shop located here as well as more options to eat and drink all in all a great experience for solo travelers such as myself to couples and entire families of all ages\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "instead of taking the cable car i went there by climbing the stairsit was a bad choice but im not regretting my choice because it was a spectacular view and experiences i mean i know you can get the same view if youre using the cable car but it is all up to youbut for me it was really close to nature and you can see the eldest holding hands like a real relationship goalduhsince my guesthouse just around the corner so its really handy when i was there i went for 3 packages which includes the hello kitty island a too much pinkish place for people who are hate pink ssen toy museum yassss marvel fan star wars alert and observation decksurprisingly at the hello kitty island was a fun place to enjoywhile the ssen toy museum a place that so amazingimagine the life size of iron manokay i need to stopso the last stop will be the observation deck was well yeahif you used to go any obdeck so just the same when i went down the surrounding for this tower as you already knew the lockish for couple things but also good for taking pictures\n",

      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "we have visited a number of towers in various cities worldwide unfortunately we didnt think this compared particularly favourably the place was crowded and noisy and it appeared to consist more of numerous retail outlets rather than a tourist attraction much of the tourist industry was focused on the practice of love padlocks  quite interesting to see chained everywhere but obviously a good opportunity for selling these items  at the top of the tower was noisy with very loud pop music the windows were not totally clear and no local landmarks were indicated the deck one floor below showed some local landmarks but it was not possible to walk all the way round  the cable car offered an efficient service to avoid a hot lengthy claim and it afforded some reasonable views  we managed to get in the front on the way down  the visit was by no means a disaster there were quite good views of the city and it was worth the visit however are less commercialised site and more indications of the local geography would have enhanced our experience\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "it is a wonderful experience to watch the city from the tower top it has small shopping area and you can look for memento and giftsthe sky scrapers of seoul the river and the lush greenery are all a sight to see for those looking for a sight seeing holiday seoul could be an option\n",

      "====================================================================================================\n",

      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "good thing is the amazing sunset view but i think you can have similar experience with other hilly places such as hukchon maybe because i had a tight budget but i feel the experience here is like downloading a mobile app that i think would be free then its inapppurchase with very heavy charges they charge you 800020000 krw for cable car or each floor if you want a full package you need to pay a lot this is very crowded ao it takes 1 hour just to stay in queue ;___;\n",

      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "i do love a sky tower but this experience wasnt the best from a distance n seoul tower stands tall and chic our experience was far from chic queued for about 15 hours before even making the cable car flight in a waiting room crammed full of tourists and little ventilation the room was filthy with people dropping their trash all over the place and noone cleaning it up not ideal but we dealt  when we eventually made it to the tower foyer and the top of the hill we were presented with a further wait whilst we waited our turn to ascend the tower itself  after our expedition to the top we were quite disappointed the windows were really dirty which made photographs and the general view pretty poor there were no outside viewing areas and they really pile the punters into this tower so theres very little room for manoeuvre theres also a picknmix candy store which is just absolutely ridiculous  probably worth a visit if youre in the area but you should try to go early in the day to avoid the crazy queues\n",

      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "i didnt take a ticket to go up to the observatory however the view is nice from the around the tower with lots of things to see i find to enjoy this experience is to walk up from the bottom of the road instead of taking the cable car or the bus the walk is about 1 hour and so nice along the winding road which is mostly shaded lots of people walking their dogs jogging and just enjoying the day out food and drink is expensive when you reach the top  5 dollars for an ice cream  so you may want to pack some things in your day pack before you gowater etc it was nice to see seoul from this point\n",

      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "this is a must visit for anyone who would like to experience highrise building we took a lift to 117 floors and from there you can take pictures lying on the glass looking down for people who afraid of heights perhaps you can take pictures leaning on the glass windows instead a good place to visit\n",

      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "i took the sky shuttle to the top of the tower it was not a very busy day for it but they still packed you into the elevator like sardines it would have been a much more enjoyable ride if they had 2 or 3 less people on the elevator you literally have people pressing up against you on every side once we got to the observation deck i was disappointed to look out the glass and discover we were in the clouds you couldnt see anything it would have been nice if they had warned you before you bought your tickets that you wouldnt be able to see much there were a couple small breaks in the clouds and you could see a little bit of the ground but then all the rain running down the windows made good pictures nearly impossible when it was time to line back up for the elevator to go back down there seemed to be no order to the line people were cutting the line pushing  shoving it would be a great experience on a nice day if the staff did a better job of managing the crowd\n",

      "please make sure to visit this place during the day unfortunately we were there at the evening and didnt have enough time to see all of those little shops osulloc is worth a jeju tea time experience\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "insadong is where most of my gift shopping took place but the area offers fantastic restaurants traditional tea houses street food that takes on a performance art flair and friendly shopkeepers bargain hunters can score here if theryre mindful as many items that experience a high markup in fancy tourist shops can be found in humble street stalls for considerably less not to be missed\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "this is the main touristic street of seoul and it has lots of souvenir shops art stores and traditional eateries also just close to the jogyesa temple in the street which runs parallel to insadong there is a small place in which you can rent and wear a hanbok for 20 minutes for 3000 krw this would be an unforgettable experience for foreigners you can take lots of photos in 20 minutes one more thing dont forget to buy ice cream from the turkish ice cream shop at the insadong intersection the icecream guy has lots of funny tricks for you and it is really hard to take the ice cream from his hands just try and see and burst into laughter\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",

      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "a great place for souvenirs wide vairiety and were also cheaper than other places not so much on skincare but a lot of unique brands and items that can be seen there overall was an interesting experience\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "insadong is like a place trapped in time you get a whole new feeling and experience once you enter the main street of insadong time and activities seem to slow down just a little for you there were many people when i went there but it never dampened or affect my experience there at all tons of galleries shops selling traditional handicrafts instruments and paintings tea houses chic little boutique shops and quaint undiscovered restaurants which fell right into my alley i love appreciating art and antiques so i really enjoyed my time there especially when the art galleries there displayed art and held exhibitions free of charge i practically spent the whole afternoon going in and out of different galleries and admiring the archaic yet enchanting old shophouses lining the main street very touristy area but i still loved it\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "this market has some great little cafes and restaurants so try some tea or shaved ice while you are here the antique shops on the side streets are really interesting and some of the main souvenir shops are really goodhigh quality items not necessarily cheap but very good busy and crowded but friendly and fun to experience\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "insadong is less than a mile stretch filled with stores and street vendors it can get pretty crowded especially on the weekends but its a fun 23 hour stop you can find some pretty cheap souvenirs to take back home and dont forget to explore the side streets where most of the cafes and restaurants are at this is where we had our first silkworm experience and the taste and smell still haunt me\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "there are many markets out there but this one is the best for souvenirs i was in seoul three times in the last year and i cant get enough of this place great street food good restaurants you can bargain here  yes there are various official tourism stores that are a little more expensive but they give you great ideas of the traditional gifts to go out to the other stores to bargain  various temples at either end of the street and a palace  get the donuts that are 2000 won delicious  we found a place to have fish eat the dead cells of off our feet for 9000 won interesting experience they also have legit massage parlors as well\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "if you are looking for small things to bring back for friend and family than this is one of the places you can come to find lots of restaurants as well along the side alley so you got to walk into them several shops selling tea and their accessories  there is also a couple of shopping malls rather a 45 storey high building with small shops selling several items  a good time is that it is across from the buchon hanook village if you are staying there to experience the traditional korea homes than this place is just walking distance away\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "this is where you go to get the traditional food knick knacks teas and tea pots there are plenty of shops make sure you talk to the shop owners about tea and various items they sell that you may know recognize its a neat little strip of shopping plus the restaurants in the area are old traditional hanoks and is a great experience for foreigners if you can sit on the floor\n",

      "good experience\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "might be a good place for kids if you want your kids to grow up with terrible morals and no respect for animals and life came here in december of 2021 thinking coex aquarium was a major tourist destination but was immensely disappointed when i saw 20 clown fish in a 20 gallon fish tank to add to it there were about 20 other fish living in the tank there were no plants no anemones for the clown fish to live in and it was the first tank on display  there were two manatees a dangerously endangered species literally in a tank not even two manatees long no plants cruelty  visit coex aquarium to experience cruelty at its maximum potential\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "you can meet various fish and animals that live in water here in addition you can see performances in the water and participate in various programs such as feeding experiences so make sure to take a camera or cell phone that you can take pictures with discount events are always under way for many people so it is effective to check the website and visit there there is also a parking space so you can go without any burden there was a souvenir shop so i could come back home with good memories\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "bought 4 tickets to coex aquarium via klook and it cost us approx sgd25 per paxwith the experience many interesting sea creatures penguins sharks walruses etc especially love their interactive stations where they allow u to touch the sea creatures eg starfish clams fishes they even have a fish spa area very suitable for families with children my elderly parents loved it too totally worth the trip  the layout of the whole area is v well thought out foreigners also get to experience a free hanbok experience\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "just like other reviews here the reason why we went to this aquarium is to fill out the use of our discover seoul pass the entrance fee to coex is on the high side and will easily justify the cost of the discover pass this is one of two aquariums that is available for entry by the discover pass and this is one is much better as the other one felt more like an oversized aqua pet shop  some displays are in ponds some are in big tanks but a lot are in aquarium tanks sizes however the aquarium tanks are big for a lot of the fishes so these provide great viewing opportunities the fish spa experience allows one to feel the doctor fish nibble on your hand  the coex mall has also been upgraded as compared to the last time i went here a long time ago\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "went there at 12pm with a group of young kids over the summer just in time to catch the sea animals feeding schedule there was a small touch pool and also a hand spa from doctor fish what an experience for the kids it took us about 3 hours to finish the whole thing as we also took quick snack break there is a snack cafe which sells hot dog sausage ice cream and drinks there are many drinks vending machine in the aquarium too  if you simply want to see some sea marine the tour usually takes 115 hours\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "it was an ok experience but way too expensive for what it has to offer not impressive and the entrance was around 25000w\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "i have been to several aquariums but this is by far the best great tour inside plus a show as well nice experience for people of all ages\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "coex aquarium s located inside the coex mall in the beginning of the visit i though that was so bad experience but the visit along the way is getting better and better the high point is the sardines show a very nice place to take children\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "on a work trip so decided to drop by the shows were average and was hoping to see a bigger tank i was comparing to my experience in osaka and singapore aquariums entrance fee is 22000 won that said they made the whole experience very convenient with multiple lockers clear signs interaction with sea creatures etc it was just smaller than expected\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "visited the coex aquarium after a visit to bongeunsa temple not a really big aquarium tanks are mostly small however i enjoyed their petting zoo whereby we were allowed to get up close to sea creatures overall an average experience for i have seen bigger aquariums\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "quite a standard aquarium experience in the middle there are some funny installations such as phone booth aquarium or fishes swimming inside a laundry machine a bit expensive compared to other major aquariums in asia\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "when you see the aquarium from inside coex mall its deceiving it seems like it would be a very small aquarium but once youre inside it keeps going and going with pleasant surprises i especially liked seeing the sharks through the clear glass tunnel i also enjoyed seeing the penguins jump in and out of the water there are two downsides to this aquarium its very crowded on saturday afternoons which should come as no surprise youll be bombarded with kids and some parents that might bump into you with their strollers also the prices are a bit steep 22000 won for adults 19000 for middlehigh school students and 16500 for senior citizens but if youre patient youll be able to enjoy a nice experience\n",
