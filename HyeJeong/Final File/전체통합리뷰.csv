82,3, The view itself is mediocre It has only a symbolic meaning of visiting the mountain behind the neighborhood where Namsan Tower is located on a trip to Seoul 
83,3, I honestly expected much more The views are nothing to write home about during the day or at night the climb is quite shabby in the elevator expensive and you have to wait If you have nothing else to do in Seoul 
84,5,Beautiful place to visit with friends or couple

153,5,  N Seoul Tower aka Namsan Seoul Tower has been established as a landmark and tourist attraction in Seoul for a long time 
154,4,Great view of Korea from the top A must visit for tourists
155,3,We didnt reach the opening hours of the tower but we got the cable car up there and the view was pretty amazing Its worth it to reach the top even if you dont visit the tower

157,4, A must visit place when visiting Seoul You can see the whole view of Seoul and the night view One of the best places 
158,5, Its a weekend so the wait is over an hour But the night view of Seoul at night is so wonderful As much as the observatory is open it would be nice if the souvenir shop on the first floor was open until late You 
159,5, Namsan is always good to climb fun

207,4, A good place to visit in Seoul sunset recommended 
208,5,super view  worth your trip
209,2,Having been to many cities worldwide I have been up my fair share of observation towers And sadly this has got to be the worst one Its as if whoever designed the observation deck did not do any research into what makes a good one I 
210,5, The night view is so beautiful I went up from Hwahwa Station and although there are many stairs it is worth going up The Namsan Tower shopping mall is only open until 1000 
211,5,Nice view
212,5,fun
213,4,Observation Deck Was Seoul City view 
214,5, Bongsudae is good Samulnori and martial arts class 24 demonstrations held at 3 oclock are so wonderful Be sure to check it out

221,5,The view is amazing during all times of the day A special place for sure
222,3,Are you going to  Namsan Tower from downtown by walk Its like climbing 100 story building Not recommended for children and the elderly 
223,5,  
224,5, If you come to Korea you must visit it at least once I like the sunset and night view 
225,4, 
226,5, The view is beautiful even from the top but when you climb the tower the view is beautiful  Its worth going to see it at least once 
227,5, The weather was so nice and the surrounding scenery was beautiful 
228,5,Great views of the city
229,5,Thats a very beautiful place
230,5,Cue to cable car were long but did keep moving
231,5, It was good except for the huge line to ride the cable car But maybe its because I went late There was also a lot of garbage from people 
232,5, Convenience facilities such as food and entertainment are common The scenery is good to overlook Seoul at a glance 
233,4,It was nice
234,5, attractions in Korea good for a walk 
235,4,It is very nice place yet almost impossible to go by car as you may go untill a certain spot and then have to use bus or hike for 3040 minutes
236,4,Excellent tower and decent experience There are very nice views at the top that can you enjoy The problem is that it got really crowded on top with hundreds of students shouting Perhaps the number of people who can enter can be restricted
237,4,Good place to have a look at Seouls skyline The entry ticket is reasonably cheap but there isnt too much to do at the observation deck Unfortunately the windows were quite dirty and some viewsphotos werent as good as they should 
238,5,The best spot for the view of city
239,5,The place of my dreams  Where I want to go I wanna know it I wanna explore it I wanna find it out by my own
240,5,I love South Korea  
241,5,Great views of the city for a fair price we booked through Klook for nearly half price Make sure you use the restroom at the top insane views for a bathroom
242,4, Namsan Uejeoppine Cable No kidding waiting for one hour 
243,4,Another iconic tourist attractions in Seoul
244,5,worth a visit
245,5, Great place for sports and relax While looking at the city of seoul from a heightwaow 
246,5, There seems to be a lot more to see and play than before 
247,5, Seouls famous Namsan Tower I went up the stairs for the first time on a weekday The stairs are about 848 revisions 
248,5, It is a very cool place  not the highest in Seoul but you can see all the city from here There is a 12000 won ticket for a man I used to spend a lot of time at the light show downstairs Then comes the fun 
249,5, Its a very hot day so its foggy and the night view is a bit disappointing  After viewing only one elevator is operated and many people are inconvenient 
250,4, Everyone who has been there admits it what do I need to say 
251,4,I have been here a few time over the span of five years Over time the locks outside have gotten disgusting I cant remember if the light room was always there but its a nice addition either way The periscopes are amazing The coin machines seem to always be empty or put of service
252,5,Must visit
253,3, Ill try to enter After all even today the observation tower is Pasu 
254,3, Night view is okay After Corona people just flocked to ride the cable car  Its hard for Jin to run out 
255,2, There are too many people so it is difficult to see the night view the waiting time is long and the inside of the tower is cramped I recommend just going up to the octagonal pavilion 
256,4, Even if the number of ticket booths is reduced one person at the sales counter should be awakened 
257,5, I saw the key to love Does their love last Today someone grabs the key 
258,4, I think it would have been okay if I didnt go up to the observatory with the kids They liked the light before the observatory elevator 
259,4, I think it is a place with the best conditions for a place where you can feel the full view of Seoul 
260,4, I couldnt find the lock box I left 4 years ago The road to Namsan Tower was almost flat and convenient As the corona virus was almost over the number of tourists increased and the cable car was also in operation 
261,5,Excellent panoramic view
262,3, The night view of Seoul from a high place was great but there were inconveniences due to the overall facilities and operation 
263,3, The observation deck is nothing special Rather eat delicious food at the restaurant on the second floor 
264,5, Namsan Tower that Neymar also visits It is one of the landmarks of Seoul and you can see the city at a glance and there are food 
265,3, Tower Jazz was really good As I kept watching the sunset night view I felt that it was a famous place in Seoul However the interval of the shuttle bus going to the tower is too long so it 
266,5,Come here when the end of winter i dont recommendation because the wind sooooo bad  but definitely will come here again if i visit Seoul next year
267,5, One of the places where you can see the night view of Seoul 
268,5,I liked the light show which requires paying extra 16K won to go to top of tower

270,5,Like all places in South Korea it is a wonder
271,2,Every step I take I wont go again byebye
272,5, The view of Seoul Tower on the daily walking course is really good 
273,3, Tower tickets are discounted today But we couldnt go because we had to go home With the promise of the next take the cable car 
274,4,N Seoul Tower was extremely beautiful and there was a lot to see Almost all of the stores were closed so we couldnt find bottled water anywhere until we got back down off the mountain Other than that it was a lot of fun
275,5,Excellent view of the city Go early as it gets pretty busy as the day goes on  Cable car up unless your very fit
276,5, I went up on foot Good for a walk You dont have to go up to the tower to get a great view 
277,5, A must in Seoul however I advise not to go there during the first days of your trip to make the most of it It is indeed more fun and enjoyable to get to know the city a bit before seeing it from above You will 
278,5, Representative attractions in Seoul N Seoul Tower 
279,3,Well a little boring
280,3,bought via klook the queue was too long to take from the cable car station took us 2 hours to reach the top would have chosen to take bus up
281,4, Seoul lookout site to see the city in 360 You also dont miss much if you dont go up to the top of the tower which costs about 19000 won There are very good views from the free zone and you can go up by bus or 
282,5, Visited by Seoul Trekking Its convenient to take the bus 
283,5, Great place for a view of Seoul The night view is more beautiful A place where Brazils Neymar also visited recently 
284,5,One day I will visit Seoul 
285,4, It is good for a walking course and if you are tired you can take the bus 
286,5, Its worth going up once in a while You can see the whole view of Seoul It may vibrate a little and make a noise 
287,5,Amazing view
288,5, I went to Seoul Trekking hosted by the Seoul Sports Council It was a 62km trek from Jangchungdan Park to Seoul Tower and it was a very fulfilling and proud time 
289,5, The tower is great  the view over the city is great Unfortunately Corona has also left its mark here and some shops in the shopping center are empty 
290,5, I also enjoyed the performance hosted by Seoul Metropolitan Government 
291,5, Its sweeter and more accessible than Lotte World Tower But even a visit to the Brazilian national football team represented by 
292,5,It was a fun experience If your an out of town personbring your comfywalking shoes
293,5, Its good to go for a walk and visit in downtown Seoul from time to time 
294,5, Its a place I know but its a strange place Its gotten a lot better As expected the view of Seoul is Namsan 
295,5, Take circular bus No 1 and climb to the top The feeling of looking at the East Sea will come crashing down like a wave 
296,5,Beautiful placei love it
297,5,Very beautiful made a wonderful impression
298,5,Stunning views over Seoul Nice area to wander around I liked the duck statues and padlocks There were places to eat and toilets Worth noting we were offered 25 off if we paid by cash instead of card Bus went part way up the hill then there was a short walk Caught the cable car back down You have to pay extra for this
299,4,We took a train and then a bus to get here Once you hop off the bus there is still a failry decent uphill walk involved Lots of greenery and the view was worth it Seoul is an awesome city to look down on and i would recommend doing this and Seoul Sky at Lotte world tower as they both offer jawdropping vistas even if the Lotte World view point is higher
300,4,Very good experience Good views from the top however we went on a clear day so it could be different on a rainy day Lift was a bit tacky but overall would reccomend going for the views 
301,5,The Seoul Tower is really not difficult to access I just walked to it and it was not even a hike but a nice walk
302,4,Such a nice place for a walk and has a beautiful view My husband and I went up by walking since I love hiking but you can also decide to go up there using the cable car They were also filming some kind of a Kdrama at the top so we had to be quiet Also we used an app called Dealightme to get a discount for the tower entrance fee Im sure it would be a great experience where you can see beautiful sights of the whole city Lastly dont forget to leave your Lock of love if youre going there with your significant other xD
303,5,The visit at the seoul tower is an experience unforgettable  well the are in that place made me remember the scenes of my dramas and the think that my favorite artists were recording in the place i am filled emotion i enjoyed a lot the route well it was how to be in a dream made reality  is a place beautiful because from above can you see all seoul and the view is great  you feel in the Paradisethough a disadvantage of place is that the lights of the business are very talls and hinder the vision from outside This visit it was the best and definitely i recommend let them go a visit the tower
304,5,With these view things they are always hit and miss  This was a hit and I would highly recommend coming  Use the Cable Car to come  We arrived just before sunset the day views were nice but slightly cloudy  As day turned into night the views were spectacular  Before getting your ticket and going to the top of the tower or after get a drink or bite to eat or browse the shops and soak up the atmosphere on the lower ground section  Lovely with the lights  Such a great vibe  Can get chilly so take a light throw  Purchase a ticket and then head up  Pretty quick  When you get to the top it is all enclosed but the night views were stunning  There are seats if your lucky enough to get one plus a place where you can purchase drinks sweets souvenirs and other things  Very busy  Strangely there were a lot of children  Clean  There are toilets as well Waiting for the lift to go back down took a bit longer but was still quick  Nice  I would have liked it to be less busier so you could really soak it up and enjoy the views but it was a weekend and I still enjoyed it  Would recommend for sure  Staff are not the friendliest  For those scared of heights this was not that bad at all
305,4,The tower is one the most amazing place in korea From there you have a beautiful view of seulyou can leave your love lock and take beautiful photos with an amazing background I recommend goin in the afternom or eveningyou can enjoy the view of the city more and there are few people It has affordable prices and the costs are around 9500 W for adults or 6500 W for children The tower has an abservatory this is a unique and extraordinary experience  It really is a very beutiful place people from many countries visit the tower this has to be one of the first place you will have to visit in Korea
306,3,Nice view of you can see if though the filthy windows We went at sunset and it was packed and stuffy I wanted to avoid covid so we got the heck out working 10 mins Better off going to the Lotte World Tower
307,5,I hiked up the stairs path and down the road path I think next time Id stick to the road side because the stairs are SO HARD to climbat least for me Still I was proud to get to the top Once there the view of Seoul just cant be beat Its amazing I went in the Fall so seeing the colorful trees just added to the beauty of the journey
308,5,I have visited couple of times Both experiences were amazingly great Highly recommended if you like walk and enjoy the opportunity to see greater Seoul
309,4,We visited Seoul Tower during the summer of 2020 It was pleasantly even more enjoyable than I thought it would be Be sure to wear walking comfortable shoes The trolley up gives a lovely night time view Theres a love locket bridge You and your special one can either bring a lock or purchase a lock at a little store and attache to a bridge or any of the rails in a certain area you can also sign the benches and novelty items there Youll know the spot when you see it The elevator up the tower is super fast and all the little rooms you go through to get to the viewing spot at the top of the tower are delightful and offer opportunities for selfies and pics We enjoyed the great view of Seoul from the observation tower and the portions of the glass floor Actually found some really great gifts to bring home to the kids who didnt travel with us Overall an enjoyable experience Plenty of taxis outside but beware they dont want to travel too far out of their radius so you might have to check with a few before finding one to get you back to your hotel depending on where you are staying Also know in general traffic in Seoul is horrible It can take way too long to get from one spot to another Plan for that as you make your plans
310,5,The SkyRail Cable Car saves you the time  energy of climbing up to Seoul Tower on foot so youll have more timeenergy to explore while you are up there Worth the 12 per person I suggest bringing a lock from home w your initials on it; that way youll have a unique lock thatll stick out from the sea of locks sold up there Breathtaking views too
311,5,The views are amazing but I also really recommend walking up and down the hill instead of the cable car if you can  Its a long climb but so worth it especially if you go at sunset Youll also skip the long cable car queues this way
312,2,I walked from my hotel a nice 3 km walk through Seoul Last bit through a forest The tower plaza decks and viewing deck at the top is covered in American kids Halloween music like monster mash Cute at first but after about 10 minutes Im dying to get away  The music and the gift shop feel of the whole place was a big minus for me There are some restaurants were you can escape the music It is a great view from the top of the tower though
313,5,Namsan Seoul tower or Seoul tower or the radio tower is a popular tourist spot in the heart of Seoul close to Myeongdong It is located on top of a mountain and is accessible by roadcable cara hike Prefer going in the evening to catch a glimpse of sunset  night time of Seoul However it gets crowded  boarding a cable car would be a long wait A whole lot of love padlocks are put up in the rails  it was mind blowing to see them locked for years together You can see a lot of people struggling to pose and snap the whole tower in the picture This was fun to watch  View point for photoopusual convenience storessnack barsrestroomssouvenir shop are available at the top
314,5,Great view after a power walk through Namsan Park Loved the views of the city in all directions Gorged myself on gummy candies from the candy store
315,5,this place had 360 degree vies of seoulbest time to visit is afternoon until night to see the lights at night
316,4,I went to Namsan on my first day at Seoul I went there at golden hour to catch winter sun set Seeing Seoul from top bathed in golden sun rays it was really worthy went all the way to Namsan Tower against breezing wind winter A cup of hot chocolate was enough to keep me warm during my visit
317,5,If your in Seoul you should visit the N Tower The view is very fantastic you can see the city lights on the top its nice to visit during evening They also have restaurant there in case your hungry and you want to enjoy the view while eating
318,4,The N Seoul Tower is relatively easy to get to by trainbus You can take a special bus to the top of the hill or you can hike it up the hill which is a very good workout Go to the tower in the evening as the view of the city is fantastic There is also a couple of gift shops to purchase your souvenirs A must see while in Seoul Take the tram ride up to the elevator at the base of the tower if youre not up to the hike
319,4,Well worth the time and it offers a great view of the city There is plenty of merch to buy and of you get hungry there see restaurants here as well Of you visit during winter you should dress warm since it could get pretty windy up here  It is easy to get here by bus and the entrence fee is pretty cheap
320,4,The day we arrived in Seoul after putting our luggage at the hotel we straight away took a bus to Namsan Tower I booked the ticket using Klook and scanned the ticket at the entrance The view at night is amazing you can see the whole area If you have strong legs you can walk up the hill
321,4,Located in a relatively central location in Seoulno direct metro but can easily navigate your way there by alighting at Dongguk University stn exit 6 n go to bus stop near Uni bridge Take bus 2 n 4 to reach Tower located at Namsan Mountain whereby one can take many nice photos Tower visit itself is rather optional as the mountain already provide a fantastic view of the city Defo worth a visit
322,4,I purchased the Skip the Line ticket but for the time I actually went during the day middle of the week January I didnt need it however it seems like from other reviews you may still want to consider it I took the Hop On Hop Off Bus  Palace Route to get to the tower Its still quite a hike up the hill but the sun was out and the views of Seoul were really incredible I feel very lucky that the weather cooperated and while there was some glare through the windows and a bit of haze I think my photos came out okay and I had a good time just walking around the floor looking at different points around the city There is helpful signage with the distance of different cities from Seoul There is a small gift shop where you can buy postcards and even mail them There is a sit down restaurant but I believe you need to have reservations Once you get out of the tower there are other restaurants and souvenir shops I wish I would have taken the cable car that sounds like it was fun
323,5,I sure am a sucker for towers and tall buildings I donno why and Nseoul tower was one of the best121 floors high I guess and the glass bottom and all the photo opswe all had a good time
324,4,We visited it during weekday to avoid the long line of the cable car We skipped the ticket line by purchasing it thru Klook The view is much nicer in autumn
325,4,Its a pretty nice place I enjoyed the hike up to the tower got some great pictures Not really worth the money to go all the way up to the tower tho
326,4,from myeongdong we walk uphil to the cable car station it was 3PM in the afternoon And once we arrive at the station we need to wait in line for around 50 minutes before we can go up it was quite a waste of time considering the cable car ride was only 5 minutes  then since we already bought the observatory tower ticket via Klook then we go up directly however to my surprise the view from the deck was not that special so its not worth the cost You can see a better view without go up to the observatory tower and spend more time on the locks of love area which is cute  we go down via shuttle bus to myeongdong its way cheaper and time savings compare if you have to take the line to get the cable car
327,5,Super awesome place I really love everything from here  Would like to go back again here Super worth it
328,4,We had 1 day in Korea so we decided to go despite the weather It was a lot of people local and foreigners We can only imagine how spectacular it would be on clear day
329,5,I did not mind spending the money for the cable car ride or the ticket to the top They view was absolutely worth the cost  The coffee shop at the top had amazing desserts there were stoolstables to snack at the 360 degree view was amazing the elevators moving quickly and the bathroom had quite the view seriously
330,5,Located on Namsan mountain in central Seoul its easy to get to Just after dusk provides breathtaking views You need to take the cable car up the plaza area Here you will find lots of attraction like the love locks something similar to Paris wishing pond various observatory decks food court museums and the entrance to the observatory tower itself which boasts of panoramic views of the city of Seoul One of Seouls must visit attractions
331,5,Namsan Tower is known for many things the cable car ride the nice trekking at Namsan Park the great aerial view of the city museums and cafe  At a height of almost 240m the tower has an onservatory deck that offers an amazing view of the city The iconic letter N was the result of the remodeling of the tower in 2005 Since then the place is known as N Seoul Tower with beautiful bright lights at night
332,5,My family and I vacationed in Seoul for New years Eve We stayed at the millenium Hilton in front of Seoul station we didnt know what to do for New years Eve countdown So we decided to climb the mountain directly in front of the millenium Hilton At The summit is Seoul tower From which you can see the New years Eve fireworks from down below The temperature was about minus 8 degrees Celsius We bundled up around 11 pm and started up The hike was very lovely As you hike up you can see a beautiful a 360 view of the city of Seoul at night Its not a hard hike And there are art installations along the way Including a strange love heart lock it installation Apparently you can buy love heart lockets and write a message and lock it around these fences and other art installations along the mountain At the top of the mountain there are cafes and gift shops You can purchase tickets to go in to Seoul tower We did not do that Instead We got some hot chocolate and coffees and celebrated 2020 watching the fireworks from down below The fireworks were very small from our vantage point and not that impressive but overall it was a beautiful hike and an absolutely fantastic way to ring in the New year It started to snow along the way as well but that made it all the more romantic and special My teenage daughter took many pictures We walked around with our hot drinks looked around the gift shops and then made our way back down as we started to feel the chill I highly recommend this hike I could not have imagined a better New years Eve  It was perfect
333,5,What a gorgeous view of Seoul at night When we got on the bus to go to the tower I didnt realize that it was at the top of a hillmountain so I was surprised that we didnt just walk but I was thankful as we made our way up the windy roads that walking wasnt happening It was definitely worth the trip and I loved the whole experience Would definitely do it again next time I come to Seoul but maybe during the day next time
334,4,The prices for the ticket were a bit expensive considering the surrounding attractions are significantly cheaper We enjoyed the view though and the many opportunities to grab a souvenir Would definitely come back during a different season to see how the view would look during spring or summer
335,5,It was really an amazing view at night Although it was 1c but it was nice to see The place had recreation for the young ones  had alot of food plc too
336,4,great views at the city from above but was a bit hard to walk up closer to the tower the views outside were actually more picture worthy Loved sweet post card mailing service the best souvenir ever sent a card from atop of the tower to my family across the world Liked walking around different lower levels lots of cool statues and giftshops food places etc
337,4,It was opened to the public in 1980 and provided TV and radio broadcasting in Korea and also used for tourist purposes and on a nice day you get great views from the observation tower Located on Namsan Mountain it stands 480 meters above sea level and visible from most parts of Seoul
338,4,We went up the tower the day after it rained which meant the air was clear and we had absolutely stunning views all the way round especially over far into the mountains to the north I imagine that had we gone later in the week when the smog started to creep back in the views could have been quite disappointing It was also reasonably priced and the gift shop actually had some good quality items which was a nice surprise I have knocked a star off as the little cable car that takes you to the base of the tower from the bottom of the hill was not working on the day we went and we had to take the stairs  not an issue for us but if you have mobility problems you would have been stuck
339,4,There is LED tunnel Love Lock area and also the observatory deck It is best to go with lover Easy to go there by bus or cable car
340,5,beautiful and clean inside and out Alot of history is shown throughout the area of the towerThe ride in the elevator was beautiful  look up when you get inside the elevator
341,4,Well worth a trip up to the N Seoul Tower Great views on the cable car up to the tower and from the tower itself
342,3,The tower is interesting but probably not worth visiting unless you have a nice clear day It was dull the day we went and you couldnt see much
343,5,highly recommend to take this trip during night hours so you can actually see the city lit up I would highly recommend spend the extra money to skip the line do to how busy it is You can purchase locks there for 10 to place wherever you would like If you go while its cooler outside dress warm it does get cold up there
344,5,Nice view  around the City Local Customs is the attractive part of the place Dont forget for  key 
345,4,Climbing the little mountain where the tower of Seoul is located nearby the right heart of the city Enjoy the 360 view Amazing
346,4,Firstly do not trust Google maps direction to get to the tower It requires you to alight at a quiet bus stop n walk up aong walk up a hill Follow the directions on the website Its more reliable  The tower deck is not that big but it does provide you with a typical city view that must towers provide  Do check out the toilets Its a place where you can relieve yourself while admiring a city view
347,5,If in Seoul for a short period of time and not sure what to see definitely make your way to N Seoul Tower From Myeongdong walk to the cable car and ride up from there The views from the top are amazing
348,4,Its quite a ride to get to the tower but the stunning view the adjoining Hello Kitty museum and Ryans Cheezball Adventure is worth the effort The all around view from the tower also tells you in which direction your country is from that spot and the distance too It was an evening beautifully spent
349,5,Nice visit efficient ticketing and very quick lift to the top The digital visuals in the pre tower departure area very good and some of the best we have seen Not really any queue to get up to the top or back down again Good views of the city
350,5,Visited the observatory by cable car The cable car is a short walk from myeongdong train station The cable car brings you to the walkway of locks where one can continue to the tower At night one can see the bright lights of Seoul as well as the numerous vehicles coming in and out There are some retail and ding establishments at the retail area of the tower
351,5,We bought 3 ticket for 1 couple n 1 adult got free popcorn for 2 Nice view from top when reach viewing floor
352,4,It was quite hard getting there; we got lost thrice Waze was a mess in guiding us We found a different route to get here though We booked online tickets to take us there via the cable cars  It was cute getting to the area where there are lots of love locks The view of the city from the top was beautiful on a sunny day It was windy though but altogether it was a nice experience
353,4,The tower is a place to observe the city You can choose to go up by walking the park take a cable car or by bus The canke car will cost you about 7000\ one way or about 10000\ return
354,3,Probably outshined by Lotte Tower which of course is bigger and badder but the wait times and surrounding area at N Tower are much better There is good food a bar lovelocks and a trippy colors room before you enter the tower elevator
355,3,I didnt go to the actual tower but rode up to it and put a lock on the lock wall If you can bring your own definetly do as they are overprised  and dont forget a pen as they have none for you to use  only to buy The view was pleasant and the price was fine
356,2,If you are planning to go to the observatory mind the weather conditions as they do not have any notice about the visibility They did not offer to give a refund or to make it valid for another day Very disappointed
357,5,Amazing view from the TOP after we trekked 15km up  There a love locks area up the mountain  Sky tower are awesome  we got to view beautiful Seoul because the sky was cleared 
358,4,Overall excellent experience Dont try to drive there unless you know the way Navi apps dont quite work The taxi took us on our second attempt Long walk up to the tower but there is a gondola option Lots of food and souvenir shopping options up there We waited 40 minutes for our queue to go on up It was t quite and large as I though once up there but the views were amazing Go at night for the best experience A lot of others scenic spots on the ground and trail
359,5,A tall towers light ignite the beautiful sky of Seoul on the top of the hill that is called N Seoul TowerNamsan Tower With its astonishing beauty Namsan mountain flourished with locals and foreigners alike  This is a place where love Cupids make their wish and lock their love in the pad lock to symbolize eternity of true love or finding love of their life A breezy windy moment spend with love one and beautiful scenery of Seoul city 
360,5,If you are a fan of Kdrama the night scene at N Seoul Tower definitely did not disappoint The cable car ride was pleasant and orderly There are multiple inexpensive dining options by the tower The public space to view the night scene at the foot of the tower was huge so even on crowded days it did not feel claustrophobic It was a pleasant place to spend a nice evening
361,4,A quintessential tourist stop in the outskirts of Seoul We did not go up the tower Just hung around the base area and took in the scenic beauty There are locks for sale for the lovebirds to place on the fences A lovely view of the city from the top of the hill
362,5,Decided to pop in to ya e a burger woo no regret The burgers are juicy and Smokey We had both Classic and a Tower burgers as well as the potato croquettes No regret
363,5,Went during the day and Took a long walk up from Myeongdong tiring as its up slope Ideal to walk from Shinsegae department store and take the slanted elevator up to the cable care point View is wonderful from the top and super cold during winter Some restaurant and shops best for scenery viewing So many love locks around
364,3,Going by public transport with old folks is not convenience as you have to walk up the hill to reach the Namsam cable car centre
365,4,This place have a nice birdeye view of seoul You can still see them without going up to the main tower There is a place for the locks where friends lovers and family expressed themselves by placing a padlocks phone covers there Take care because the slope is quite steep getting up Basically its good for photo taking
366,4,Took bus 6011 from Namdaemun Market Beautiful walk for those who likes to stroll up on foot but require lots of stamina  Need to pay to go up further to the tower We just checked out the six storeys at the base of the tower You can shops and convenience store here Lots of shiny locks at level T1 where lovers secure their love locks  Go around 5pm to catch both sunset and night view
367,5,This is where you can find the famous Love Locks in Seoul Offers a beautiful view of the city during the day  a magical view at night
368,5,Wonderful Romantic and Memorable thats what weve experience visiting N Seoul Tower or Namsan Seoul Tower In the chilly dusk of November in Seoul we went here via Bus 3 in Chungmuro station exit 4 The ride took about 30 mins because its the rush hour and many stops so if you would like a faster way to get here can take the Namsan Cable car or taxi or you could hike to the tower itself Takes around 1100 won one way and it is the last stop in its route There are many tourists in the entrance and buses both public and tour buses and parked there so it tends to get busy Indeed it is one of the most visited attractions in Seoul Standing high at 774 ft it is an observation and communications tower and the second highest in Seoul It is my second time to visit this place but this time during the day My first time in 2016 it was at night and we went on top of the observation deck inside the tower overlooking Seoul from Namsan Mountain where its located right at the heart of Seoul The ticket costs around 11000 KRW This time around 2019 we didnt go inside but we visited the base of the tower which surrounded by the beautiful Namsan park and its wide array of trees that include Maple Pine Ginko Cherry blossoms and many more Since its fall the colors are full of Red Yellow Orange White and Brown truly mesmerizing eye catching romantic and beautiful We took a lot fo beautiful photos and videos before these blooming trees in the colours of Autumn Up here you will have a panoramic view of Seoul  its skyscrapers buildings castles villages and rivers It is indeed a magical view for us You dont even need to go up the observation deck Another great feature we did is the Lock Padlocks where tourists and local couples put their padlocks as a key of their endearing love for each other You could write your names and buy the keypadlock from the minimart inside N Seoul Tower We indeed put our padlock in the midst of thousands of locks placed in this mountain The Lock Padlocks also offer a great panoramic view of Seoul the Tower and Namsan Park We left just before night falls via bus and it was a short yet memorable visit for us It is indeed of the best and beautiful destinations in Seoul so please do come visit when you arrive here in Seoul Korea
369,4,Like any tower in the world N Seoul Tower has its own unique attractions Located on the top of Namsan mountain it offers breathtaking 360degree views of Seoul city There are 2 public transportation options to get there via cable car or bus Via the cable car there is no immediate subway access and youll need to walk up the hill from Myeongdong subway station Mind you if youre traveling with young children or elderly this can pose a challenge Or you can take bus No 02 No 03 and No 05  Once at the base of the tower the area is clean and pleasant to visit Dont miss out on the love padlocks near the tower base for nice phototaking opportunities To get to the top of the tower requires separate entrance tickets
370,5,Set on a small mountain in the middle of Seoul the tower has views that show the tourist just how big Seoul is with satellite towns stretching aolong every valley from the cental mass of the city The lift to the top is quite special Walk up the mountan if you are able
371,5,A great experience to visit N Seoul Tower Its almost like KL tower of Malaysia Nice surrounding embeince To reach there the cable car ride was great
372,3,Went on a hazy night so the view and the photos taken were not fantastic We bought Klook package which offered transport via Hyundai Starex van uphill plus the observatory deck tickets And we took the cable car downhill which was a great experience About 20pax in a cable car Cable car station is just about 1015min walk to Myeongdong station
373,4,Very touristy but you can see the whole city We walked up the mountain but realized afterward that there are 3 city buses that go to the top
374,5,I recommend going to the N Seoul Tower Observatory at night since you can see a beautiful view of Seoul There are a lot of places to eat and shop As couples you can seal your memories here through the Love Lock bridge locks are sold in vending machines which is so cool The easiest way imo is taking a bus to any available station near you Also the comfort room in the observatory is something you shouldnt miss 
375,3,You really do get a spectacular view of the whole city of Seoul most especially at night when all the lights are on It is breathtaking The staff directing us toward the elevator and the one who went with us inside was really cheerful and attentive The 3 stars is because when we went there in the evening there were only a few staff that we could see most of the time we didnt see any The ones at the information were not too helpful as well I was asking for help with the machine to scan the QR codes I had 5 etickets and was asked to input the numbers instead one by one  took me quite a while to finish and when I could not read the last one since it had very small prints the guard took the paper from me and scanned the QR code in just a few minutes if only they told me that was the easier way then I wouldnt have wasted my time inputting the numbers manually Other than that my friends and I did manage to have a good time there
376,4,On my Third Day in Seoul I walked up Namsan Hill Beautiful walk with all the tree turning red yellow and orange On the 5th Day went up using the cable car It is a must visit Enjoy the view of Seoul from there Only sour point was when i bought coffee from Twosome Place i was not allowed to drink in the Burger Restaurant where my daughters was having their Hotdog Too rigid in my opinion
377,5,Another top option to include in your to do list is to explore Namsan towerthey say it is the geographical center of Seoul The observatory have orderly queue and there are employees assisting every guest theres even a photo activity w cgi effect background but best to arrive early if you are targeting to view the sunset on the tower the best time to see expanse view beautiful of Seoul 
378,3,Lots of walking n sightseeing if u have time can easily spend half a day Trick to photographing is to tilt your cell phone to adjust the background
379,4,Yes admission to ride the elevator to the top but it is worth it and not just for the view Prior to the elevator you walk down a psychedelic hallway before entering a bizarre room with swirling lights and patterns I think it is to entertain the visitors while waiting for the elevator But it was quiet on our visit and hence no line up and no one was in the room we were free to act stupid and take videos of silliness before heading up Once at the top its a short 360 degree walk around with window panes distances to world cities imprinted on them tourist trinkets and snacks for sale and a restaurant one floor down Then its another ride in the elevator back down Speaking of elevator even though the ride is 20 seconds at most they get you to look at a screen in the ceiling which plays a short video I guess to stifle the boredom in the vertical box all 20 seconds of it  Oh and the view All depends on visibility On a clear day as the song says I can see for miles and miles
380,5,We walked up to the Namsan Park Cable Car Station Bought oneway cable car ticket instead of round trip to N Seoul Tower  The tower offers gorgeous city views Many food outlets there too  Thereafter we took a leisurely slow walk all the way down to the base of the hill and took many many gorgeous photos of the beautiful autumn foliage
381,5,Namsan Seoul Tower serve as radio tower and also a tourism spot It is near Myeongdong walking distance is around 1520 mins depend on your paces Reachable by bus and cable car  Excellent views Great experience  Dont go on weekend The queue is super long  Food is limited choices Can be extreme cold in winter  Prepare a love lock if you want to lock one
382,5,A well recommended hike from the Grand Hyatt Seoul to the Tower Excellent for all ages especially families
383,3,Two options to the top of the tower hike or take a cable car We decided to take the cable car After purchasing the tickets we have to stand in a very long queue which goes up two floors to reach the cable car station It too us 40 minutes before we got into the car The ride was smooth but the view from the car and from the tower is nothing special We went there in the night expecting nice views but there is too much light which prevents us from getting a good view of the city see picture  Lot of young couples around who come to lock their love on the railings of the tower using a paddlock This seems to be a popular belief There are restaurants and souvenier shops in the tower
384,5,The hike up the park alone was amazing although there are many ways to get to the base including a very scenic cable car  It was so unexpected with interactive virtual reality and light shows before you even get to a 360 spectacular view of Seoul If you dont do anything else do the Tower The price wasnt bad and using a Visa card we received a few dollars off
385,3,We went there upon arrival so we not dat familiar with the subway and bus  we kinda took the wrong route but ended up at the entrance near the library It is quite a hike to go up so we wud recommend you to take the shuttle bus no 3 or 5 which wud bring you up to the tower  It is true that the best view wud b at night but you wud want to be there before the sun goes down for photo purposes We took the bus to myeongdong after our trip to namsan
386,5,I have seen this tower so many times in dramas and couldnt wait to see it in person I was not disappointed The fabulous views from the top were amazing The locks and hearts were just as I imagined Im so happy I got to experience this
387,4,We got off the hop on hop off bus at this stop on a whim and had a brilliant visit here We spent a good two hours wandering around and taking pictures of the fantastic views over the city We didnt bother to get tickets to go up the upper tower as the views would only have been more distant We did however take a return trip on the Namsan Cable Car and got some good views from that A very worthwhile visit Unfortunately we werent able to visit at night to see the skyline lit up but Im sure it would have been brilliant
388,5,It is the best place to see the Seoul at a glance  Weather was really awesome too  I enjoyed it a lot
389,5,N Seoul Tower was on our list during our travelUsually people recommend to go Seoul tower during evenings to watch Citys neon lightsBut due to time constraintwe went there in the morningWe took cab till foot of the hillFrom there we chave chosen HikingYou can also go through cable car but we captured many awesome pics during our hikeIt was easy and took around 1 hour for us to reach thereWe just went to foot of the tower and returned through cable car as it was difficut for my 4 yr old son to hike downPricing is as below \7000pax 1way \4500child1 way \9500pax2way \6500child2way
390,4,I visit towers in every city I travel to so Seoul was no different However it took a lot of effort to get up there The easiest way is to take the metro to Myeongdong station walk 1015 minutes to the Namsan Oreumi elevator to get to the cable car station Even once you get off the cable car there are about 100 stairs to climb There are separate entry tickets for the cable car and the tower Get there before sunset to get great day and night views of the surrounding city
391,5,Perched on a hill accessible only by a town bus or the cable car this provides a great view of the city of Seoul  We went by cable car  and it was easy and fuss free Climbing up the stairs youd be greeted by a stall selling snacks Try out the soup fish cakes divine especially in cold weather A little further up you will see the locks and love messages there the Hawkeyed would Spy abandoned phone cases but these have handwritten presumably love notes scrawled in permanent ink we didnt get a chance to do this  Perhaps next round  We purposely chose to go up later in the day just to see Seouls night light If you are the sort whod like to spot landmarks please go before sundown  Layout is very much like the observatory tower in Shanghai though A good experience all in all
392,4,We brought an infant in stroller and it was smooth to go to the tower through the cable car However as we had reserved ticket to the top of observation there was no way for ppl with stroller and ppl said it was repaired so the only way we had to use the stairs which was ridiculous and we had to miss the opportunity and the ticket to go to the top
393,5,It was only about 10 to go to the top of the tower You get a great view you will see just how huge the city is You have to check out the urinals in the Mens room The best standing view ever Make sure that you take a bus up the hill Its a long walk uphill if you dont
394,4,The view from the top of the tower is spectacular The walk down is pleasant and provides more views Once down continue to the market
395,5,visited this place before but didnt appreciated it much because too many people and long lines but this visit is so magical 10am just about it opens you can appreciate the place and better view weather also cooperated bright and clear sky even at a very cold temperature of 4C
396,5,Honestly loved everything about this placeNseoul Tower is probably the most beautiful place ive been and I live in NEW ZEALANDSeoul is my favorite country
397,5,We had a beautiful day here You could see the whole city from the top It has super clean restrooms too
398,4,The tower offered great views of Seoul even though it was a smoggy day Ticketing was easy and relatively inexpensive Just a warning we used a bus to get here and it was a pretty steep though short hill to climb from the bus stop to the tower
399,4,Great place to have a 360 view of the city There is usually a long wait so depending on when you get there you might have to get a ticket and youll be told the time you can go up
400,5,Good place to visitSuggest a taxi to the cable car station for a great view over Seoul Just be aware that if you have anyone affected by flashing lights they might not want to go up the tower Good post office selling postcards and stamps plus you can mail right away Remember in SE Asia you have to use the glue stick provided to affix the stamp to the card Enjoyed our visit and the views
401,3,Well its a landmark and yes you should see it but I felt a bit let down as I expected more its not bad but surprisingly little things to see or do for the schlepp
402,5,We took a ride till the tower It cost 7000 won for one way and 9500 won for round way but we had to wait about 45 min for a ride so if you can just walk there The way up ist beautiful The tower stands in the middle of the park so you can enjoy amazing view Sometimes there also performances and we saw one with traditional warriors of Joseon  was a surprise for us Totally worth it
403,5,Make sure you get here around 5pm so you can see the sunset I walked up here via the extensive paths around the park
404,3,We stopped here as part of a tour so we had our own usher who guided us to the elevators The grounds are pleasant and parts of the old city wall can be seen in various places The light show at the elevator was a bit much The top floor with all the windows was filled with souvenir shops Great views of the city however
405,5,Cool weather and very nice scenery at night at the top of the tower There is a Japanese restaurant which serve nice and delicious foods too
406,4,It is better to use cable car to go up there because walking is not suitable for OKU old folks less exercise people The way to reach N Seoul Tower is too deep Unfortunately the day i reached N Seoul Tower the cable car is on maintenance so we need to go up and down by foot Luckily the weather is good and cooling The scenery is undoubtable and very nice One thing that need to take note is to reach the observatory floor there is only one lift and the only way to go there Please queue at the right floor as we experienced queueing at 2 floors but the lift isnt stop and always full To advise just wait at ground floor The love locks area is full and we decided not to lock because seems no empty space to put on it The view from top is very good worth to pay a visit
407,5,Rode the cable car to the top fun ride and such lovely view the N Seoul Tower experience was even better unbelievable view and a great experience Took the seoul city tour package
408,5,We stopped here as part of the hop onhop off tour so the cable car and trip to the top was included I recommend doing all of it The views were stunning We travelled with a toddler and she also loved it
409,4,Went up and down on the cable car and had the buffet dinner Went at dusk so got to see the night lights tooMy hubby likes towers so every city we go to we go up any tall building that allows us to Lotte tower was another good one
410,5,Had a great time on a not bad day when visibility was okay Lots of walking even with a lift to the station then cable ride to to the tower Buy or bring couples lock and add to the collection
411,5,I went twice during the trip one night trip for buffet dinner and food is not bad and view is awesome One day trip close to sunset Both day and night trip is awesome and I love the view and Seoul is under your leg Do not miss this scenery
412,5,Very cheap to go up and worth it We walked up more strenuous than you think in about an hour and got the cable car down
413,4,The views from the tower were excellent on a bright sunny autumn day  The elevator ride took less tha 15 seconds to the top There is also a Hello Kitty outlet and walkabout at the lower level
414,4,Not far from metro a quite place in the city good for slow walk to the cable car to the top of the mountain Wonderful view of the city from the view Worth visiting and the price is reasonable
415,5,This is a great place to go if you love to walk and dont mind a little steep hike Once you get to the top the view is amazing Theyve got food and beverages at the top so dont be too worried about that chicken and beer and coffee of course Inside the north tower there are also restaurants however they are very expensive Once at the top of the north tower you get a beautiful view with clear windows that go around in a circle that also includes a candy shop and a place to write and send post cards  Interesting yet fun fact the restrooms in the top of the north tower have glass walls Yes  youre read correctly Glass walls So youre doing your business as you enjoy the view   On a nice day this is a fantastic place to visit
416,5,Background get all your information from the N Seoul Tower website Gettting there most convenient is to catch the shuttle buses described in the website They drive a circular route so if you catch it at the beginning of the circle just after it has descended from Namsan Hill it will be quite a lengthy ride of over half an hour before you get to the top of the hill The best part is that it terminates at the base of the Tower All other public transportation terminates at the base of the hill Cable car most directions will lead you to the north base of hill where the cable car is located It will transport you up the hill to the base of the tower It is a pleasant ride but reputedly has long lines If you are staying in Namdaemun or Myeongdong it is an easy 20 or 15 minute walk respectively to here For the mountain climbers 1 walk up the stairs adjacent to the cable car 2 walk up the LONG road that the shuttle buses drive up 3 search for typically unmarked nature trails that will take you up the hill At the base of tower splurge and get in the VIP line by having lunch at N Grill Best time to go avoid the teeming masses by going at midday on a weekday So we caught a shuttle bus on a Friday zipped up to N Grill for lunch Enjoyed a serene and delightful lunch with a view then took the elevator down to the observatory for the touristy stuff A wonderful 2 to 3 hours Thereafter walked down the steps continued north which dropped us right into Myeondong
417,5,Like many other big cities Seoul also has its own Tower and the view from the top is fantastic As in other places such as the Tower Eiffel in France you first travel to an intermediary platform about half of the height of the tower and then you take an elevator to the upper floor There were lots of people but going up and down is very well organized Upstairs there are shops the same as in many other towers
418,3,We went up the tower and have a look at the love locks While looking around I failed to see a 15 cm step down which caused me to fall down So always look down as well while you are enjoying the view
419,3,Long queues and poor visibility due to the weather a far better viewing platform can be found at Lotte World Tower
420,5,I took a night tour bus to here and we only had 30 minutes to take pictures at this place I was not able to get to the top of the tower because of the time limit however the view I did see was fabulous The mountain is steep and it is best to walk up it slowly if you arent used to walking up mountains Though I had no time to get to the top I enjoyed the view I could see There are many tourists on this mountain and everybody is camera and selfie happy so you may have to wait to take photos at different sites This was worth coming too even if you cannot make it to the top
421,5,Can enjoy beautuful whole seoul city viewrecommend for evening time  but verrryyyyy long waiting line for cable car ticketalmost one hour
422,4,We visited on a Sunday morning and there were pretty long queues for the cable car so took a while to get up Queues were small to get up and down the tower though  There are great views of Seoul from the tower but the whole experience is a bit tacky with lots of food outlets  souvenir shops around the base plus all the locks on the fences  Enjoyed seeing the beehive beacons and city wall and the wishing pig Also the rainbow ice creams are lovely
423,4,I went after dark to see the lights The Seoul skyline is impressive There are some food shops in the observation desk candy gift shop etc There is a pretty long line coming down so be prepared to wait We took the cable car up and back At times they jam 40 people in the cars depending on the day so if you hate being a sardine wait  Overall worthwhile trip
424,4,More than the tower itself how to get to the top is the most interesting part Based on what you prefer you can do a 35 K rolling hill walk combination of flat walk with some decent hikes  some through steps and rest through single lane path series of steps all the way to the top or take the cable car to the top If you are staying nearby good area to go for a morning walk or a run
425,4,There are so many LOVE lock place everywhere down the Tower make u feel full of love before go up to the Tower I like to pick candies and sit inside the tower to enjoy the view I prefer go there before 300pm otherwise you needed to line up to get uphill by cable car
426,4,My family enjoyed going up on the tower and seeing the views and the also the interesting exhibits inside the tower My kids particularly liked the cable car that took us up to the tower and also the shows outside the Tower They had a sword show and a talent show
427,5,Its an amazing tower in Seoul You can see all Seoul from the top Nice places ther is restaurant and coffee shop
428,5,You have a very beautiful view from the tower  It s a magical feeling to be so high in the sky with al the clouds The view of the city is very beautiful It gives you the feeling to stay for a very long time up there The more than a million love locks there shows the amount of visitors going to the tower A number one must see for everyone visiting Seoul 
429,4,Took a bus from Seoul station to tower Must visit place in Seoul as you can have the 360 degrees whole city view Bought ticket from klook and redeem it at kiosk outside the entrance with ease
430,5,Best is go there in the night And I alway stay at Myeongdong area and make sure that my hostel or guesthouse can see N Seoul tower view 
431,5,I had tried to go to N Seoul Tower on a Sunday and the queue was so long it would have taken at least 2 hours to get up plus it was rainy  Instead I went back the next day and not only was it better weather and almost no queue but they didnt make me buy a new ticket and even offered to refund my ticket from the previous day  I went up the little elevator to the cable car where there was free entertainment I did not expect to see  From there I visited the Hello Kitty museum which is small but so cute  Then I got in the elevator to the top of the tower There are cool projections on the way up making it feel like youre shouting into space The view from the tower is incredible  A super fun day out and really reasonably priced
432,5,Namsang tower is a great experience from the cable car drive to the walkways with thousands of lovelocks and the stunning view from the top We find the view late afternoon is the most beautiful and no need to pay to get to the top of the tower
433,4,Its better for me take the hop of hop off so they in a way explained historic places the other just take you at their time at the end goes to a natural antiaging shop
434,4,Well worth it Awesome views A short walk from Myeongdong where I stayed I took the cable car up and walked down
435,5,Was a good relaxing environment to catch sunset they have different areas to enjoy the attraction There were gift shops restaurants we enjoyed the candy shop at the observation deck
436,1,Huge disappointment Went to the cablecart to get there but it was closed due to strong winds st happens so we had to take the bus The line for the bus was massive took 60min of waiting After the bus drive headed to the tower took the elevator up collected our tickets and was informed that there was another 40min wait before we could take the elevator up to the observation deck After the 40min wait you take the elevator up to a room with 360 projectors showing random animated movies on the walls to distract you from the 30min addition waiting time here When you finally reach the observation deck you can barely see out the windows as the lights from all the souvenir shops there are reflecting in the glass As a result of this the windows were full of finger prints and nose prints from people trying to see anything and the windows werent cleaned After this disappointing experience we decided to head out again only to find another 30min wait to get down   Summary of time waste Bus 60min Entrance 40min Entrance 2 30min Exit 20min  Spend your time on something else
437,4,Nice walk up the hill Good scenary Visit the Ryan cheese ride taking cute bear photos and Hello Kitty Island also Lots of peoples
438,5,The hiking till the tower is absolutely worth it Once you reach the top there are several shops and resturants typical stuff for turist I really advice to pay the fee to go at the top floor of the Tower Beautiful experience
439,3,Every travel guide to Seoul recommends you to visit the N Seoul Tower but after queuing up in the long lines to take the cable car up you are faced with another long queue and expensive tickets to head up to the observatory Way too crowded and too much lights from the sign to get a nice night view of the city You can give it a miss if you have other things to do on your itinerary
440,4,I went during the day so I could see the area clearly The views were very good and the windows on the observation deck showed what major city was in that direction and how far the distance is from there
441,3,One can walkdownby bus or cable way to reach to the bottom of towerthe surrounding is naturalpicturesqueObservatory desk not too high and view also not clearThe speciality is one can bind a lock to the fencing and take photosBut its not a big tower than shanghaitokyosydney and burgkhalifa of dubai
442,5,I went at night time and bought a 1 way ride to N tower there was a kpop band doing a concert their which you got to watch for free the views of seoul at night were amazing If you give during the day you can enjoy the park aswell There is loads to do at N tower The walk back was stunning Just be careful on some of the stairs as they are close together
443,5,Do go there if you get the chance The drive to the top of the hill is through a beautiful parkCars have to park at the bottom but buses are allowed to drive three quarters of the way upThere is a steep climb at the end but well worth it You are taken into a room with a picture of cars travelling along on the floor which was quite spectacularThe ride in the lift up to the top was spectacular with a visual experienceOutstanding views at the top with great photo opportunities Loved it
444,5,Awesome location and must visit activity Go there prior sunset and stay there until sunsets to view sunset
445,5,we follow google maps and we missed the stop better listen to the announcement in the bus since we missed the stop we walked to the Namsan Library From Namsan library we chosed to walk steep 16 kmnot to hard in autumn since the cool temperature it was beautiful and crowded especially during the sunset timeeverything trying to find the perfect spot for taking video pictures during sunset there are some cafes down there food not bad but the service is quite long Going down no problem there were some busses that would take us downtown
446,1,Were not gonna complain about the hours it took to get to the observatory because had it been a good experience we wouldve forgot about the hasssle; but it was not Once we reached the observatory we couldnt enjoy the view as the reflection of the food and drinks station light on the windows ruined the view let alone how dirty the windows were AVOID
447,3,Too many lines No sign posts View of city was not clear since the glass was reflective The view from nearby Signeol Seoul was much much better If in Seoul one could consider going to tick off the list but this ones quite average
448,5,Was a big walk up we chose not to take the sky lift take plenty of water and good shoes Its doable though and worth the good work out Great views by the time you get to the top the tower is more like a lighthouse so dont be worried if issues with heights Beautiful views worth seeing
449,4,The tower gives a great opportunity for fantastic views over the city Even at base level the views are great but the 360 view from the observatory is better However its not the cheapest of venues to visit  so make sure its a clear day else its an expansive cloud view There ate various floors of food stalls  kid activities
450,5,Namsam tower is a must go not only for locals but visitors alike especially I youre looking for a romantic scenery Although it can get a bit crowded sometime it is well worth the travel at least once in your life Its not only for couples so dont feel left out if you are alone If you are a couple bring a lock with you to secure your love on a rail fence at the top My suggestion is to go right before sunset instead of daytime the city lights is very beautiful so you can observe both day and night while youre up there
451,4,Lots of development around the tower over the past several years My favorite way to get there is walking one of the many paths through the woods I get lost every time I go so I will not try to give directions Other options to the tower are cable car and bus There is are shuttle buses that regularly circle loops between popular tourist destinations  this is easy and convenient The tower now has many little shops restaurants coffee shops plenty of snacks and trinkets to buy even without buying a ticket to go up the tower This is nice in case you are there on a cloudy day when its not worth the  to go up the tower Also plenty of photo ops and opportunity to get a love lock or leave your cell phone cover on the fences not sure what this is all about visit the hello kitty island etc a trip up the old radio tower is quite spectacular  they have a neat light display before the fast elevator ride to the viewing floor On the observation floor there are signs to let you know what you are seeing pretty amazing views on a clear day and of course shops to buy snacks and souvenirs Its been ages since we visited the restaurants up in the tower It was a nice experience however limited vegetarian options and not really great for little children Overall a good place to visit better on a clear day wonderful to get a little exercise if you have the time and ability Something for everyone at the tower  I would go again and absolutely bring friendsfamily when they come to visit
452,5,Arrived at cable car station only to find it was cancelled due to winds Advised to take a No2 bus to tower but could not find it Decided to take short cut up the steps Ascended with sensible pace and forced stops  Bought tickets and lift to top floorThe 360 view was breathtaking of Seoul had enjoyable refreshments and returned to base after an hour We went on a Sunday pm  no queues and all staff very helpful
453,2,We spend lots of time waiting in line to go up and even more to go down The view from the bottom of the tower were maybe even better than from the top Really overrated site
454,4,Even before you go up to the tower the surrounding grounds look pretty Lots of selfie time with beautiful backgrounds The love locks areathe love archway when lighted up Go there during the evening time and you can have both the day and night time photos A few eateries like mainly drinkssnackscafescan be found there View from the TOP of tower was so so to mebut the elevator ride up there was swift and interesting because you were asked to look up to view the show about the tower I thinkthink it was done so you will be distracted and not feel nauseous when climbing up at a speed to the TOP floor
455,4,Recommend coming here in the evening for a great view of Seoul lit up I didnt go on the observation deck but managed to get good views of the city from down below There are a few reasonably priced restaurants on the lower floors of the tower Bus no 2 goes here from the Chungmuru area
456,4,As usual the tower Is a must if you wish to see the city from the top Great view and location around is also interesting
457,5,One of the best viewing platforms in Seoul Only costs around 4 compared to 16 at Seouls Sky Although the observation deck is lower the view is much more beautiful than Seoul sky and you can see all the sky scrappers which are especially nice during dusk and at night when everything lights up and there is an outdoor observatory too Forget Seoul Sky do this instead  Recommended
458,3,Well you gotta do it when in Seoul right Trouble is everyone else had the same idea so it was rammed at the top  Terrific view though as youd expect although the glare from the gift shops reflects a bit too much on the windows at nighttime spoiling photos a little  Im glad we went; but it was just ok and didnt wowme
459,4,Very good to visit but if possible avoid of the weekend as it can get quite busy Be prepared to wait for at least 1 hour in the line each way
460,5,Too bad that we were not able to go inside the tower itself only a distance from it since it was too cold We were just at a village tourist attraction down below It looks nice from afar
461,3,We made the mistake of trusting Google Maps to get up to the tower It took us to no mans land and our curvaceous Tongan bodies had to hike up the mountain certain someone would have a heart attack on the way Though it seemed like a bad idea once we finally got up the mountain we felt like Rocky Balboa or that we had conquered the world and we got much needed exercise  The view on the Sky Tower was as expected however the highlight were the toilets with a view Wish I had needed to go at the time because that wouldve been a memorable 1
462,5,It is a tower located on the hillside you need to take a cable to go to the hill top you need to walk around the square where you will see lots of padlocks But you have to pay for 11000 won to go up the observatory to see the whole country view You can also have a meal at the top before you come down
463,3,There are 2 ways to visit N seoul tower by cable car or to hike up My siblings and i decided to hike up as the cable car waiting time was 1 hour It was a long hike with stairs and its tiring So I recommend to take the cable car if you are with kids or if you dont plan to exercise  N seoul tower itself was nice the view was great   its mostly just enjoying the view and also chilling around that area  So if you love looking at the views and take photographs then this is for you otherwise theres nothing much to do
464,5,The view of Seoul city is beautiful to see from this place I recommend to come here by sunset There is an area where you can leave locks of love so dont forget to bring your own locks and write a message if youd like to leave one There are also shops and food shops Its easy to get there by bus as well
465,3,Make sure and scout out the hot spot times I went at a very busy time and the hours spent waiting to get to the look out not the observatory tower was excruciating Beautiful and worth it nonetheless  Seoul especially is full of lovey dovey photo ops
466,4,Seoul North Tower was the final stop of our first day tour in Seoul I can truly say that we were not ready for walk up the steep hillinclinemountain lol to get to the tower Of course theres easier way to via Tram But we decided to be brave it was a real workout but worth it Our guide took care of tickets and other requirements for us to get into the Tower What an amazing view What was most noticeable to us was the cleanliness of the place Well maintained in comparison to my experience at the Tower in Paris Although it was crowded walking around was easy An highlight for me was the toilets in Tower Our guide suggested that we should see it even we didnt want to use it Pic below There also other attractions on the grounds of the Tower as well Well worth a visit but be sure you are rested and ready to take it all in  they do have comfortable sitting areas We spent approximately 1hour and saw most it had to offer
467,4, N Seoul Tower Situated near Mount Namsan or Nam Mountainnestled in Namsan Parkthis was Koreas perhaps the first integrated transmission tower and Seouls first broadcasting tower How to get there Well for the sporty kinds one could hike for the restone could take a bus or hail a cab to the cable car station From the cable car station one could continue hiking up the steep hill or take the cable car and breathe in the breathtaking view of the city Best time to visit is late evening so that one could capture the twinkling lights of the city below After demounting the car there is a walk up a few stairs to a landing with ice cream shops The landing is indeed pretty with cartoon characters constructed around benches and love birds locking the locks around the railing as a tribute or a promise to each other Once you move towards the second landing or the terrace you see a beautiful sitting area surrounded by trees and yet again you see beautiful locks attached or lovers attaching to a padlock to the Locks of Love Seoul Railing As One could also buy heartshaped coins to throw into the Wishing Pond in hopes of finding eternal loveThe terrace has a sitting area an eatery and a shopping center The upper deck of the terrace has a huge heart shaped structure You can click a romantic picture or two with it as a background The ride up the elevator to the observatory gives you an awe inspiring panoramic360degree view of SeoulThe revolving restaurant and Grill at the towers top story without doubt gives you an imposing and magnificent view of the bejewelled sprawling city below
468,4,There are a few ways of getting atop the mountain to access the tower but the ways are not really explained or marked properly including the time it will take to reach the top This is my second time hiking up the hill This time I took the stairs which were packed and it it is around an hour to get to the top with a multitude of breaks for taking photos The hike is moderate but those with knee pain might find it difficult I wish we had taken the other hike not up the stairs but we couldnt remember how to get to it The views were nice and sunset beautiful We took the cable car down
469,4,Not the first to visit and of course be sure that you will enjoy a clear sky otherwise you will loose the reason to go all this way up to the hill the breathless view of seoul
470,5,NSeoul Tower experience is something that a traveler should not miss when in Seoul It gives us a breath taking 360 degree view if the Seoul metro
471,4,A lovely way to see all the landmarks of Seoul once you reach the top The best was before going to the top there was a 3D room with some amazing 3D animation We were not able to enjoy and we were in a rush I recommend you keep half a day so you could enjoy the surrounding area of the tower in the ground levelYou can find the centre of Korea in the garden
472,1,We planned an afternoon visit If you are hard of walking like my partner or pregnant like myself this is not recommended The queue to get tickets for the cable car is extremely long and in this Seoul late summer heat is was unbearable The queue moves quickly however there is no coordination and it seems people just stand everywhere Once tickets are bought you queue to get up to the cable car As My boyfriend has a walking issue and I am pregnant we got the lift up however if this wasnt the case you had to queue round the stairs of the building standing whilst waiting The cable car itself is a nice experience if you enjoy heights and it has a nice view Once youre at the bottom of the tower it is equally as busy We bought tickets to go up the tower at 640pm We did not make it to the observation deck until 830pm The boarding system is amongst all of the shops and cafes and it is a SHAMBLES Its very very very busy with very limited seating and as I say in this heat it is not enjoyable You then queue to get to the observation deck once you have boarded and this again takes forever Once you reach the observation deck it is just so busy you cannot enjoy the view We spent maybe 10 mins before trying to make our way down  only to find the queue for the elevator down was roughly 4560 mins long Overall a wasted day
473,4,Beautiful birds eye view of the city But the waiting time is very high Better to visit during summer
474,4,Lovely walk up instead of the cable car lots of steps but shaded through the trees some squirrels and birds to see on the way Great views over Seoul without going up the tower The usual coffee and restaurants in the buildings below the tower
475,3,We went up by cable car and when we arrived we found the whole area looked very dated Admittedly there are very good views from the top of the tower but we thought there are much better places to visit than here unless youve got plenty of time in Seoul By all means go and have a look but ensure the skys clear because youd only go up there for the views the tower itself and immediate surrounding areas are a little underwhelming and that includes the Hello Kitty Island experience which I can only recommend if you are a diehard Hello Kitty fan Even for the likes of us who find Hello Kitty quite cute it was not worth our time
476,4,Best place to rest and enjoy the view of seoul Full of light at night and many places to take photo
477,5,We came here as part of our bus tour so it was a quick 1 hour tour and we had to get going  Place has several coffee shops and restaurants if you have more time The view was spectacular from above Well worth the time Easily spend more time if you can spare
478,5,Overall this place are superb We took taxi from Myeongdong to Tower We took cable car and reach to the top Such a beautiful place and very huge and clean Must visit
479,3,N Tower has great views from the top of Namsan yet the facilities are old tower gets very crowded and is a little bit overpriced
480,4,Great views of the city Not as tall as the Lotte Seoul Tower but set up on a hill which gives it almost as much of a commanding view Several coffee shops and restaurants as well as gift shops at the tower as well Spend an hour for a quick look around or spend longer and enjoy the view while drinking coffee or grabbing a bite to eat
481,5,What a superb view This is the tallest building in S Korea and 5th in the world The glass floor will give you a fright and if you are brave enough you can walk out onto the floor and have your picture taken Looking straight down through the glass is amazing On the floors at the base of the tower you will find restaurants I thoroughly enjoyed this sightseeing excursion and did it at the beginning of my trip From the observation floor you will get a 360 degree view of Seoul
482,5,Despite it being extremely windy from the typoon we still had a good visit Amazing views We had lunch at the restaurant which was amazing You cant beat dining with a view like that And for something different definitely use the toilet facilities its worth it
483,5,Great place a must to visit kids and adults been to other observation decks but this was the best
484,4,Seoul lies out there like 30 big cities all so close together that theyve become one Great view but it can be crowded  The view from the actual tower is impressive but you have to pay for it and the view from the bottom is just fine as well
485,5,The smooth safe ride up love locks beautiful views of Seoul city and an experience a lot like TeamLab Borderless in Japan once you go in to the tower Its on a much smaller scale than the TeamLab Borderless one but amazing nonetheless You will have to pay more to go up but so worth it the observation views are gorgeous and you really get a unique view of this special city Theres even a post office box up there that you can send postcards to the USA and other countries from Great experience
486,5,In the Namsan area we visited this site in order to see the city view and were surprised for the better then our expectations I recommend to go there and use the cable car  to get there
487,5,I have visited this place in Feb 2019 Located near Myeongdong Subway Station We reach there by walk Best time to visit is in the evening There is one place on the tower where couples tie locks  Its really cold during winter Definitely will visit this place again 
488,4,Its a popular place for both tourists and locals Especiallyat night many tourists go there to look around the Seoul city with the beautiful light
489,3,Visited in the evening but the view was marred by fogsmog If you get clear weather the view would be great Took the escalator lift to the base of the cable car tower and then up via cable car The wait on a weekday evening was reasonable for such a popular place Quite a few eating places be prepared to pay tourist price though
490,4,A new style of getting out and about Very interesting place never seen anything like itenjoyed very much
491,4,I have visited this place in Feb 2019 Located near Myeongdong Subway Station We can reach there either by ropeway or by walk Best time to visit is in the evening There is one place on the tower where couples tie locks like Pont des arts Paris Try to avoid this place on weekend as it will be crowded
492,4,Took the trip up to the base of the tower by the cable car however didnt go up this time due to the heavy haze  I have been up before and the view is good however there is a lot of reflections off the glass  The base has cafes and tourist items available however I noted the price was well above city prices  Great view even if you dont go up the tower
493,5,Is a Must When visiting Seoul great place to spend the afternoon or the whole evening shops  restaurants coffee shops and lots of entertainment
494,2,To be honest I found this tower to be way too touristy We went there in the evening to enjoy the lights of Seoul but we were kind of disappointed You have to wait in line for quite a while to take the elevators to the observation deck of the tower and when you eventually get up the reflections of the candy and souvenir shops in the tower spoil the view You can buy and write postcards that get stamped in the tower itself but the view is better when you stay outside on the hill  Not worth the money
495,5,We tried to go at night but much too crowded By day it was fantastic There is so much to do including the trip to the top There were performers and restaurants and shops It was the best day with my daughter of my entire trip to South Korea
496,4,We were staying just a short walk from the tower cable car so we thought wed go one afternoon  We got there around 1630 and I was glad we did  The ride in the cable car is reasonably priced around 1000 AUD for a return trip  The longest part of the journey was the 3 flights of snaking passenger line that we waited in  The cable car offers a pretty good view the car gets loaded to maximum capacity so try and get in first for a good window position  Once up on the tower area the views of Seoul just keep going  Its very popular with locals and we saw plenty of local sports teams during the night  Plenty of places to eat ranging from street cart style food court to restaurants  There is a padlock area that was supposed to be removed some months ago but I think there may have been a lot of resistance to that move You can still buy padlocks of various prices and write your message of love  It was really nice watching the views change this time of the year it didnt get dark until after 2000 hrs  We didnt stand in line for as long to go back
497,5,Went on a sunday night  the queue for the cable car was huge We waited about 40 minutes The view from the top is amazing though  we were fortunate with the weather too
498,5,I love Seoul Korea N Tower gives a breath taking view of Seoul It has the locks bridge souvenir shops cafes Hello Kitty shop cable car ride Cant wait to see this place again
499,5,The view was incredible and it was not too scary for someone with a fear of heights Ticket price was cheap and so was the restaurant next to the tower There was even somewhere to write and send postcards inside
500,4,Make the hike up if its not unbearably humidhot its a nice walk up from Myeongdong doesnt cost much to go up and has great views of the city Personally Id avoid any cafesrestaurants at the tower and head back down to Myeongdong for food
501,5,Greater after renovated The tower has many gimmick along the way to the top   star ocean room  the 360 angle projection mapping room  even the ceiling of the elevator have the vdo while it elevating Make you feeling excitement  great view of course  great air
502,4,This is probably the best overall view of Seoul It has four different floors available for viewing You can watch the Sunset and get a good picture There is a gift shop where you can buy a souvenir and a lovely French restaurant We went to the Tower on a holiday so the observatory was a little bit crowded 
503,4,Fairly busy place Take a bus 02 to get there via line 4 Easy to get there The main issue is getting to the entrance as the lift is full most of the time Once you enter the tower you will be entertained with visual lights  Remember best place to take photo is in the observatory deck toilet
504,5,Seoul toweris situated at the top of the Seoul There are love locks for the couples So many locks were locked at this place thousands of them The beauty is awesome Must visit during nights
505,5,Beautiful place but there is a big long walk hill that needs good fit body and not recommended to go on summer really hot The place is clean and perfect for souvenirs they have the best collection for the tower
506,5,Its a must on Seoul beautiful view you need to take a cable car which is full and seems shuttle are also available Once up you need to buy another ticket to get to the top can take another 20 or 30 minutes There are restaurants souvenirs Before getting to the top of the tower theres an awesome video mapping show it worth to stay and watch them all excellent job  On top of the tower crowded as any other landmark will auggest to avoid on cloudy or rainy days
507,5,10 minute less taxi ride from Myeongdong No long line ups Locks and pens can be purchased at the location relatively pricy
508,5,Amazing views of Seoul and the mountains We took a hop onhop off bus tour to this delightful tower The views were well worth the trip I wish we had gone back in the evening to see the views from that time as well The day views are amazing and there are quite a few things to do and eat there as well A little something for everyone
509,5,I love this place Situated about 480 meters above sea level you can see the whole view of Seoul There were interesting places to seefood to eatthings to buySurely a great place to visit I hope to be back
510,5,We hiked up to the tower A bit strenuous but worth it There was a show at the base which was fun Lots to see and take in at the top And the food was great Took the tour to the top Gift shop at the top along with a panoramic view of the city And the bathroom stalls have windows from floor to ceiling  hilarious And they were very clean Ice cream churros beers treats everything for everyone to be satisfied
511,5,If youre in Seoul YOU MUST go to the N Seoul Tower The view of the city is incredible It is the perfect instagram photo spot There is food at the top and it is fun to hang and people watch everyone at this tourist hot spot
512,5,Must visit in any time of the dayThe Hello Kitty shop is super cute the love locks and basically all the area around is Amazing oh and of course dont forget the once in a lifetime view of the towers last floor Simply a must 
513,4,High with a beautiful sight over the entire city We loved the signs on the windows that took us home I personally do not like all the souvenirshops but a lot of people do so it seems to be a thing fot lots of us But the view is great go there when the weather is bright
514,5,A tower located on the Namsan Hill You can get here in various ways We went by cable car which station is located about 15 minutes walk from MyeongDong subway station line 4 The tower top is reached by an elevator From above there is a great view of Seoul you can also eat something in the restaurant at the top of the tower
515,5,This is one of the top rated things to do in Seoul and for good reason The views from the top are absolutely unreal That said there is quite a hike from the bottom to the top of the tower No cars are allowed in the area so you take a shuttle bus costing about 1200 won per person from Myendong Bus stop 3 and a few other locations It takes about 30 minutes to get there From the drop off point you have to walk up a steep hill for about 5 minutes to get to the lift to get to the top Once there you buy your tickets They offer a student discount and also a senior discount for people over 65 and also a handicapped rate Make sure you have some documentation of the disability as Japan and Korea are really tight about this and will not take your word which is really stupid Last week we had to wait about 40 minutes because of the amount of people there so we spent some time in the gift shop capitalism amirite Ended up getting to the top eventually and was blown away by the sheer scale of Seoul This and Tokyo just make every other city feel like small villages even LA and NYC
516,4,The top of the tower shall show you the view of the City of Seoul You will see the buildings or the industrial part of the city  If you will go via train Myeongdong you will still need to walk a little bituphill Lot of energy though is needed because it is uphill and the stairs for the cable car After riding the cable car you can walk and look at the love locks place Walking further youll arrive at the observatory You will need to have the passes and ride the elevator by then  The place is popular for tourists so expect queueing for cable cars and elevators
517,4,Magical place I arrived at 8PM and lift at 11PM So in daylight and night and the twilight The restaurant turns so you see all of Seoul from a bird point of view It is expensive like 100 euro But so worth it And very good as well Small portions so if you have a big appetite It is very quite and lots of privacy
518,5,I loved this overall journey of going on gondola n cuming back by foot loved those love locks its beautiful n nice views of city from top of mountain dono why this place have bad reviews kids loved it 9 n 5 years old n its very easily approachable from local bus
519,4,Lots available Would be a great date spot where you could spend most of the day Different food options good little hike can opt for a cable car ride fun love lock location a kids area and just some nice nook and crannies to sit and enjoy
520,5,We walked from Myeongdong area to the cable car station 2025 mins where we took  W35000 for 3 adults 1 child to the tower ground floor  We booked tickets at the Klook apps in advance for entering the tower which are much cheaper It gave instant confirmation with QR code We just need to take the physical entrance slip at the kiosks with the mobile confirmation  There are some shops and restaurantseateries at the Tower  Its a popular place and must visit We spent 3 hours here in late afternoon  I must be back in one autumn as it will be full of maple leaves
521,4,N Seoul Observatory Deck showed us an amazing view of Namsan and Seoul It should be visited by tourist as it is known as one of the top tourist destinations in Seoul
522,4,My kids enjoyed the N Seoul Tower and the Hello Kitty Island especially the latter The only really disappointing thing was that the grand piano did not work Maybe there should be a restaurant in the Hello Kitty Cafe
523,4,I think it was worth the line and wait to go up to the to There are lots of fun things to see and do as well The tram up and down is such a unique experience highly recommend for anyone visiting Seoul
524,4,Glad I visited now as the leaves of the trees are so greenmy favorite time to visit is at twilight the changing of colors outside while Im up there is really magical
525,5,We had amazing view through N Seoul Tower and I love that you get to choose riding with fee of course or going through the stairs
526,4,Nothing much to do up at the observatory level just enjoy the scenery and have some twosome coffee
527,5,good experience top building  good service  good manner  good prepare  fast  quick  beautiful  amazing view
528,5,We took the cable car up to the mountain the views were stunning there was much to see and the waiting time wasnt as bad as i expected took only about 5 mins on a Tue at 3PM highly would recommend the voucher redemption was easy as well the machines present had an English option
529,4,Nice view at the top Stayed there for longer than expected Very good experience and easy to redeem redeem
530,5,I didnt expect this trip to be so much fun for my children There were Cartoon characters everywhere which they loved to spot There was a Cablecar ride to the top not as hot as I thought it was going to be inside the plastic box full of tourists they have barsrestaurantsice cream parlours and the view is stunning on a clear day The cost doesnt get you to the top which I do find disappointing You have to pay an additional cost of 11200 at the half way point to go the all the way in an elevator to the top 3of our party did and 3 stayed behind They enjoyed their extra trip which had an exhibition at the top The cable cars were larger on the return journey which I found very reassuring Taxis and busses are at the entrance if you dont want to walk back to your apt It didnt feel packed with the amount of people actually up there There is an amusement arcade half way which entertains the kids no end
531,5,Its one of the most famous spot in Seoul  must visit We walked from the Namsangol Hanok Village fresh atmosphere nice weather We really like it It only can be reached by the cable and its worth You can see full view of Seoul city if you go to the top of the tower So 2 tickets cable from the bottom and other ticket to go to the top There are some icecream shops and cafes But do not try Churos its really bad hahaa
532,5,N Seoul Tower what more can i say It has a certain romantic feeling to it yes also known to be the hotspot to get engaged  it really is a sentiment the facility caters for all ages and all walks of life the N Seoul tower has tons of restaurants and gift shops up in the tower and also out there is also a game arcade restrooms and of course accommodating the most beautiful veiw and prospect of Seoul getting to the destination itself was not a hassle depending on where you stay in Korea you can always catch a bus at Dongguk but getting up to the tower requires abit of foot work and good old hiking shoes or any type of shoe that wont have you slip on its inclined path but the little hike is all worth it The entrance fee is reasonable about 10000 won and youll always be entertained in the towers elevator the tower assistant were helpful friendly organized and structured it can be abit overcrowded up in the tower but it still IS A STUNNING VEIW
533,5,There are two ways to go up to N Seoul Tower using a cable car or walking We chose to go with a cable car The cable car was pretty expensiveand a little long line but were okay with that It was a beautiful view from the cable car We can see the city view When we arrived we bought a love lock and hang it there Overall it was an excellent experience
534,4,My second visit to N Seoul Tower was tons more comfortable than my first one as I didnt have to spend hours finding my way to the tower brief recap we got lost walked for almost an hour and ended up riding a bus This time we rode a bus and alighted at the towers lower entrance which meant that we had to hike uphill to reach the ground floor of the tower It was a bit of a climb but it provided for a beautiful view of the tower and its picturesque landscape We arrived just before sunset so everything was highlighted with a gorgeous golden hue background We were fortunate for clear skies during our observatory tower visit; however the views you get as you climb uphill or descend downhill prove to be more breathtaking than the one you get on the tower
535,5,A beautiful and inexpensive way to discover the city from above We took the cable car up to the tower as the walk can be a bit difficult and long particularly in the cold winter so I would recommend the cable car which is cheap and very frequent The tower gives you a time to enter the observation deck and while you wait there are little shops food sellers and museums to look around Its a very interactive day out be sure to bring a marker and lock for the railings outside the tower Buying ones there can be a bit more expensive but its a great way to mark and remember your day
536,5,A must see for the sights as well as sounds on the path we spotted interesting birds and spiders Bring enough drinks stay hydrated Stop at the shop some cute crafts and stylish earings
537,4,We opted to walk from the nearest metro station all the way to the top and were pleasantly surprised to find that the road up is not actually that long It is steep for sure but goes quite quickly and I am a slow walker The tower itself was impressive and we opted to go up onto the paidfor viewing levels It was quite busy but not too bad in comparison to the free lower levels The view was great and it was a nice clear day so we could see quite far The tower had a handful of restaurant options including a great fried chicken place but dont order the seasoned chicken unless you are aiming to clog your arteries because WOW there was a lot of sweet sticky sauce on there Apparently seasoned in South Korea does not been herbs it means sauce  we found out the hard way The Starbucks on the lower levels where you get the tickets has a nice outdoor seating area that we enjoyed as well
538,4,An early dinner on 38th floor of Hotel Lotte and we were off to the N Seoul tower We could see the tower from the hotel  After a mini bus ride to a little hill  we had a cable car ride to the hill top to reach the base of the tower A swift lift took us to the observation floor which is circular all round the tower giving magnificent view of the city The are nic e write ups to describe the sights and also major cities in each direction with distances  very nice info
539,5,I have to say that I have a profound love for korea so coming to the famous N tower was a must The view is just magnificent and there are many places to take cool pictures If you go in cold weather seasons go well covered because if chilly up there Also I dont think is necessary for you to pay the ticket to go up in the tower the magic is outside Is crowded as hell too and it took ages for me to leave the place so i would definitely recommend you to just go to the outside part the pictures inside arent good anyways because of the glass Stay outside
540,3,Want some fresh air and exercise A good way to do that is to walk up one of the many trails or pathssteps to the top A nice walk with good scenery At the top well not so great and very touristy with inflated prices for everything I highly recommend that you forget the cable car or bus and just stroll up a nice way to do some aerobic exercise
541,4,This is where you can get a nice view os the whole city I decided to go up walking and there are many nice tracks to get there if you are motivated to walk more than an hours otherwise take the cable car  Plenty of restaurants and shops Very popular place
542,4,My mistake is to visit this popular attraction on a weekend evening When I arrived on Sunday at 940pm and got the ticket it showed the estimated waiting time to take the lift is 40 mins Examine the crowd Well the city view on top is nice with all the buildings and streets lights There is a small Hello Kitty museum separate ticket and a sweet shop on top The next pain is to queue and wait for the lift down I took a public bus back to Myeongdong around and was super tired by the time I reached my hotel past midnightThere are sites such as klook and kkday which offer discounted admission tickets to the tower and Hello Kitty museum
543,3,This is the best place for Seoul city night views However the waiting time for the cable car is quite long as it is crowded with locals and tourists Overall it is worth a visit if you enjoy night views ps speaking personally I think that paying to go up to the viewing tower is not really worth it as it is not much differences
544,3,Yes theres a great view at the top  just like in the Empire State Building or other tall buildings in the world But I actually found the free view from places like Namsan hill to be even more spectacular without the crowds the cost and the hoopla Steep walk from bus area to get there if youre driving up  otherwise the lines from the cable car or the regular elevator can be long on weekends Once I was up at the top I didnt need to stay up there very long If you feel you cant visit Seoul without saying you were there or you have no other means to see something from a high view knock yourself out and go  but if you can climb Namsan Park yourself or see a highfloor view from a hotel skip it
545,5,We really enjoyed our time there We went up by hiring a private taxi from Klook along with the ticket to enter the tower  If you wanna partipate in lock with your partner I recommend not buying from there it cost to much You can chill out in the twosome cafe and have fun  Generally a great place to chill If you have elderly please consider using the cable car
546,4,We rode a bus going up the peak It was a busy day in Namsan Tower When the bus reached the parking lot you still have to walk about 10 minutes in a steep slope to climb to the tower itself  The place was full of people and stuffs being sold We were told it was nice to go up the tower in their observatory but we didnt There are toooo many people and very loooong lines If you want to go up you need to be early or stay longer  The old shed in the area has a sad story behind it ask your tour guide if you have one because im not spoiling  There is an outside observatory deck which they call the love locks deck with scopes that will aid you to view the entire Seoul Landscape  And speaking of love locks they are literally everywhere In the park near the tower on the observatory and you can find love lock trees You can buy one if you want to leave locks there  The view is spectacular and even more beautiful with sunset and evening
547,5,It was very nice night view of Seoul city People was not that croweded and could see the fantastic view of the capital city
548,5,The tower offers great panorama of Seoul I didnt go to the tower during my previous visits This time my hotel was in a walking distance therefore I decided to visit the tower I went in the morning and walked instead of using the cable car Surprisingly there were many facilities that offer food and drinks including draft beer Based on my experience I would suggest to go late afternoon to have a dinner see the panorama in daylight and after dark and enjoy glass of beer I usually walk a lot however walking to the tower was too much exercise and I had sore muscles even three days after So some people should consider cable car
549,4,Definitely worth a visit if just for the Seoul views You go up by cable car There is a whole collection of  lovers locks tied to each other and to whatever it can be locked on Largest collection I have ever seen The views from the top are mindblowing and give a fair idea of the size and plan of Seoul
550,4,The tower has great views of Seoul We took the cable car up and walked back to the bus for our return to the city Lots of options to get there things to see coffee and food available to enjoy while you take in the view even the toilet as a view
551,4,The Seoul tower is more than a great view Its great fun for the whole family there a park in the area hello kitty mini park cheeseball adventure and plenty of wal trails to catch a view before the view To top it off you can get there by cable car that has it own wow view
552,4,They seem to think this tower can compete with worldwide tall buildings Its laughably short but compared to the other buildings in the city it does provide a nice view of the city We did a beer and popcorn package but if you dont get it to take up we wanted to sit and enjoy you have to take a long trip back after the ride up and down
553,4,After getting off bus no 5 you have to walk 510 mins of upwards landscapes to reach the N Seoul Tower  You can talk a few photo of its famous lover lock on the wall  And you can take close up look of N Seoul Tower You need to buy entrance ticket to go up to the Tower  The view is good and worth a visit  I attach the bus no and its route  So you can know which places for your next stop Hope I can know the bus schedule so I dont need to wait that long for the bus
554,4,Walked over to the cable cars from the hotel Took me a little while to find Only 10000 KRW 866 to go to the top Cheapest tower Ive ever been up Thursday afternoon and although it was not empty I certainly would not call it crowded Views were okay Difficult to find a clear day in Seoul this time of year I would definitely recommend it Lots more to do and see than just go up in the tower Best I can tell it is free to go to the tower And there are lots of great views and restaurants and shops at the base of the tower without paying to go up Several degrees cooler up there than it was down on the streets
555,4,While there is a cost to go to the top the midlevels are fun with nice views and lots of entertainment going on during the day
556,3,N Seoul Tower provides great views of the city on a clear day This is not our thing; ergo the rating There is a lot of activity in the tower and there are lots of peopleboth tourists and locals We suspect that it might be better to visit in the evening
557,4,It was nice day to see all Seoul in the sun sunset timewe have fun day with my family good few from up
558,4,We kind of got a bit lost going up there because we had a misunderstanding with the bus driver So we took the cable car instead and fortunately it was not crowded and the ride up was nice You had to wait for a while for the elevator though but the view was really good You get a 360 degree view of the city lights There were lots of food stores below too if you get hungry And of course the there was the famous love lock Definitely worth a visit
559,4,I feel like a trip up the Namsan Tower is a highlight of visiting Seoul However make sure you are prepared to spend a long time waiting There is a wait if you want to take the Omni elevator to the cable car station or you can choose to walk up the stairs like we did there is a wait to buy your ticket for the cable car there was a 40 minute wait after that to get on the cable car and then you have to walk up more stairs and buy your ticket for the tower and wait for 30 minutes until it is your turn to get in line and wait to go up in the elevator The view from the top was beautiful We had hoped to go up while it was still light and watch the sunset but it was dark by the time we made it to the top The only downside of this is that the lights inside the tower reflect on the glass so you cant take pictures of yourself and see the city very well There is also a 30 minute wait to go back down the elevator We did enjoy the view from the deck at the base of the tower and got some good sunset pictures
560,5,Namsan Tower AKA N Seoul Tower  Great place for a all round aerial view of Seoul  We took a walk up to the cable car station from Myeongdong Station Takes around 15mins  Remember to bring along your locks  or you can get one from the shops there Locks are pretty expensive there though  Nice and beautiful place overall
561,5,There are many beautiful spots to see on the way leading to the tower There are the Locks of Love which are posted in and around the various fences of this area You can even buy your own padlock and leave a message on it and then lock it onto a post or wherever there was space There is also a kids play area stores for souvenirs or snacks obviously the observation tower statues and figures to take pictures of and many rest stops along the way Although the observation tower is a good view of the surrounding area you can also get the view when just looking from the view point areas from outside the tower which is free
562,4,You can get great views from here but during peak times of the year it does get overcrowded But definitely worth going to at least once
563,4,Went up by cable car was a very interesting experience  There are LOADS of locks couples put everywhere They put it on stair railings poles anywhere they possibly can Bring your own lock  We didnt buy a ticket up the tower The view from below was already amazing
564,5,N Seoul Tower is one place you must to go when you are in Seoul What Amazing view is  Take a bus number 5 from Myeongdong Market Bus stop locates in 3 exit of Myeongdong subway station N Seoul Tower is last stop
565,5,Get an uninterrupted view of Seoul from the tower The whole place and gardens below are beautiful From the bus stop the walk up the hill is reasonably steep but it takes only 5 minutes to reach the ticket office and elevator Wear good gripping shoes as down is as hard as up Worth a visit for sure
566,4,The N Seoul Tower is such a prominent landmark that you will just have to see it and the best time to go is before sunset  The light on the Tower is an indication of the current air quality from blue to red It was green normal air quality during our visit  Wed visited the tower as part of a half day tour From the bus station to the base of the Tower there is a steep slope going up leading to a viewing platform  The view from the observatory was stunning  you get a all around view of Seoul Even the mens toilet get a framed up views
567,5,Like any other tall buildingattraction you go for the view I found N Tower to be less of a rip off than most of these types of places It was cool to ride the unmanned tram up a small hill to the cable car Views were great They do charge for the cable car as well as to go onto the observation deck and for photos but the price was reasonable Its a hike even with the tram and cable car so it was nice to do this towards sunset on a cooler day
568,5,This was great to find First get off at Myeongdong and take exit 1 There is a free shuttle to the tram You can Google free Namsan shuttle bus and you will get the site with time schedule I think it is hourly Go up the tram or if you want walk to bar of tower Go up tower before sunset and enjoy the view Be sure to visit the toilets the view is one of a kind for a restroom After taking the tram down I then walked to the Hoehyeon station on line 4 It was an easy walk There is a Cafe up the tower were you can get a coffee or sweet as you watch the sunset
569,5,Use google map to take bus 402 etc Then alight at namsam library beside namsam park  Go to namsam park and go walk towards Seoul N tower
570,5,Went up by cable car during the evening The cable car ride was quite worrying as there were 20 people cramped into a carriage and some of us were wondering aloud if this was our last day on earth lol There are places for you to place a love lock at the summit with your significant other The view from the tower itself is superb We were there to watch the sunset and the night cityscape and the silhouettes of the mountains surrounding Seoul makes for a breathtaking sight Expensive but still a must visit in my opinion
571,5,Arrived the N Tower with our group after our great lunch in the financial district of Seoul What a spectacular 360 degree view of the city Luckily we were able to watch an endorsement photo shoot by a well known KPop artist of a Nissan Car We have wonderful tour of the city that day
572,4,It is always exciting to see the landscape of Korea Seoul in particular on top of the tower You can see the big buildings
573,3,After going up countless towers on a tour of Japan and Korea perhaps this was a tower too far So I accept that this may influence this review We had to wait 30 minutes at the cable car before we could get up The Q down was even worse so its quicker and more fun to walk down Once at the top the views are great but it was a little rainy when we visited so the view was not as good as Im sure it is on a sunny day  so keep a look out for the weather forecast before deciding which day to visit on our second day in Seoul it was completely enveloped in cloud Well worth visiting none the lesshow can you come to Seoul and not say youve been up the tower
574,5,Stupidly I agreed to walk with my friend from Myeongdong to N Seoul Tower It took an hour but dont worry there are several buses which go to the top Out of the 3 towers you can have a view of Seoul this is the cheapest and buying from Klook is 40 cheaper  N Seoul Tower has a great view of Seoul especially of Myeongdong There are several activities you can do  have a photo taken with a green screen and insert different backgrounds send a postcard from the observatory deck or have a coffee or meal The mens toilet has a great view as well
575,4,Best to go a little before sunset to fully enjoy the view from the o observatory We went on a Friday late afternoon and there was queue for the cable car rides There are many choices of food available Do take time to enjoy a coffee and savor the sights What was terrible was the very long queue for the elevator ride down from the observatory It took more than 30 mins waiting time for the elevator aftet spending 15 mins in the observatory Place was packed to the brim and we could not fully enjoy the sights Perhaps would be better to visit during weekdays
576,4,We hiked up the mountain using a stairway path It was a hard hike But once we got to the top there were lots of things to do I think the coolest part was seeing all the locks of love at the top Theres a lot of restaurants up there and we went to Tokyo Steak which I highly recommend  If you go try to go on a clear day We went when it was overcast and a lot of pollution was trapped so the view of the city wasnt good at all
577,3,I caught the cable car because it was easier for me to get to  When you make your way out of the station at the top youre greeted with nice views and lots of the famous love locks The view so far is really nice and you can see quite far I thought The view from the observation decks will be so much better I was wrong  You head down some steps into a concourse area where you can buy drinks and trinkets I purchased my ticket for the observatory and waited in line for the elevator to the observation area  Essentially I paid 10000 krw to ride a lift and look out of windows covered in the handprints and faceprints of small children all the while getting barged out of the way by impatient tourists  Personally not worth the money Catch the cable car or walk up the steps to get nice panoramic views Dont bother with the observation decks  Im giving it 3 points because I quite liked the views from the hill below
578,4,We were lucky we visited on a good weather and we could see the views clearly The toilet cubicle is so interesting too with a big mirrow reflection in front of toilet seat and the glass panel at the side of it so we could either look out to the view outside or look at ourselve in the mirror
579,4,If it is your first time in Seoul and would like to enjoy an aerial view of the city this is the place to go I would recommend going there late in the afternoon so you can enjoy the view when there is light until after dark so you get to see the city both during the day and at night There are several restaurants should you feel hungry and want to eat There is a convenience store for your basic needs If you are travelling with very small children and elderly it may be a challenge walking up the steep hill leading to the tower There is a portion there where there are trees where you can attach your lock as a remembrance until the next time you visit the tower The best way to reach the top is by car if not bus Taxis are not allowed so its a longer walk by cab If you go up there during the colder months of the year bring a jacket the cold is felt very much at that height
580,3,We made the journey to the tower giving ourselves plenty time but disappointed to find the ticket booth had closed early We were also ushered away from a viewing deck despite it being quite a bit before the displayed closing time We did have a bit of a wander about where we could including the love locks so it wasnt a wasted journey
581,3,Good view of Seoul but mostly building Went up observatory and came down to the car within 30 minutes
582,4,The NSeoul tower is located close to the town centre and so provides a great vantage point to see greater Seoul and gain an appreciation of its size We visited during the day and apparently were fortunate in that the air was relatively clear which allowed us to see more than is normally the case Nevertheless the atmosphere seemed misty and objects in the distance are observed in a haze  At the base of the tower is an open area with a small shopping complex and open space which was busy with families and tourists There was also a small market which according to our guide was unusual  Access to the tower us by a pair of lifts which were not busy so we didnt wait long to get to the viewing platform This is on two levels the upper having an external area Souvenirs and snacks are available including a self serve sweet shop which was very popular  Well worth a visit and I imagine the night time view would be even more spectacular
583,3,its a nice tower but personally not a must place to visit  facilities is good the view the the tower is great but since this is no Iconic thing you can see from the Tower so make it less interesting  T
584,5,Great views of the city all around Take the Namsan cable car from the Hoehyeondong platform to Yejangdong platform at the top of Mt Namsan near the N Seoul Tower The cable car is about 605m meters up hill over the road  forest with scenic views of Seoul below You then exit and walk up to the Tower level where they have many gift  food shops From here you can buy tickets to go up and view the city hopefully itll be a clear day so you can see North Korea in the distance Interestingly around the observatory are the names of many world cities with the distance to each one depending which direction you are facing The atmosphere is one similar to going up the CN Tower in Toronto but with the added excitement of actually doing it in Korea The city is truely amazing  full of life
585,5,We took the cable car up to the tower It was a lot bitter than I imagined It has few restaurants and many sites for photos We loved walking around the tower and taking in the view of the city We ate at the restaurant at the tower and it was surprising really good It was well worth the trip
586,5,We were here on a tuesday afternoon and it was perfect Stunning view over the entire city The cable cart cost about 10000 won and so did the entrence to the observation deck  The restaurant on the observation deck is very pricey but there is a great Italian restaurant on first floor with an AMAZING view
587,5,I was using cable car to reach this place And its so amazing You could see Seoul from this place This place is so romantic 
588,4,There was a slight uphill walk to get to the base of tower Some lovely views of the city from the Tower
589,5,I love this place getting there was as much fun as the attraction lots to do great views and plenty of great pictures The lines can be very long depending on the time of year you visit You can walk but we took a cab and then used the cable tram to get to the top The lines for tickets and tram can get long just keep that in mind We spent about 4 hours at this attraction
590,5,A bit of a uphill walk from myeongdong but so worth it once you make it to the top There is a tram that will bring you to the base of the tower then take the elevator to the viewing deck of the tower for a charge for both
591,5,We visited the N Seoul Tower in April 2019 and were not disappointed The surrounding was beautiful with cherry blossoms all around it The view was spectacular especially at the top of the tower  We bought the tickets the day before on Trazycom and got a 25 discount It was easy to exchange evouchers for tickets at the kiosks at the Tower  My recommendation is to take the bus cheaper than cable car which drop people off near the tower  only a short walk to it Be prepare to walk uphill a little bit
592,3,We were advised on which bus to take The view at the foot of the tower was beautiful Bought ticket up to Observatory floor on 5th floor which included lunch at Hancock restaurant cost 50000 won altogether The view was nothing special
593,4,If you intend to take the cable car to and fro to Seoul Tower  please dont as it is not worth it  More than 35 were sardined in and with hardly any place to move  there is nothing to enjoy Its just a waste of money Take the bus
594,3,I really had high expectations of this place since I had read so much about it and being a Kdrama fan I thought it would be a wonderful and a romantic place Wellmaybe it would have been different if we went up the other way with the cable car but we went up there as past of a halfday tour First of all you cant get up to the tower area itself without walking up or taking a city bus or being part of a tour No cars are allowed That part was okay as we did go up by bus What was disappointing was that it seemed very commercialized There was a fee to go to the top of the tower That was understandable but thenthey take a photo of you when you enter which of course comes with a price tag And it was extra to go into the Hello Kitty area which seemed like a promo store We didnt go in Dont get me wrong the view was nice from the top and outside where you have the love locks and park area I guess Im just a bit jaded because of my disappointment Maybe it would have been nicer to go in the evening with all the lights But to meyou do it once
595,4,The views from the tower were amazing The walk up the hill to the cable was not but its South Korea and its mountainous  I highly recommend getting a combo ticket My friend and I got one that included two tickets up the tower two popcorns 1 regular flavour and 1 special flavour  we chose caramel and two drinks all for 22000KRW A single ticket up the tower for an adult was 10000KRW so if you are with someone get the combo its such a good deal
596,5,Beautiful view and relaxing  up here On the way up here they have many cute coffee  shop and some good snack too  Best way to come up here from your hotel is Taxi 
597,4,Well pretty much what youd expect  some great views some tacky but fun souvenirs etc Cable car ride is fun as is expected Nice territory to walk around as well
598,4,Went here because I skipped it my past 2 visits to Seoul It was quite a hike from Myeongdong to the cable car station to bring us up the tower I forgot how much but around 9000 won roundtrip but its manageable After getting off the cable car you can already see colorful love locks all over; you can place your own If you dont have a lock they sell it there You can also take photos of the Tower from that area Then there is an option to pay to get up the N tower itself Since we didnt want to eat another buffet meal we only got the tickets with pizza and pasta meal for 2 not at the top of the tower though but the pizza especially was superb At the tower itself we didnt need to stay long; 1520 minutes was more than enough It was fun to play the interactive booth game though where you can say hi to people at the Busan tower 
599,5,While the tower itself is like most viewing towers the whole experience is unique  You start from the walk up to the cable car centre Then there is the joy of taking the cable car up to the base of the tower Once you arrive on the other side there are lots of picture spots and also an area where couples place locks with their names written on it like in Paris  On the top of the tower you have a 360 degree view of Seoul from viewing platform There is this machine which is linked to the viewing tower located in Busan southern part of South Korea where you can interact with visitors who are there
600,5,The view from observatory deck is fantastic It worth to visit It easy to access from itaewon by bus no 03 and from myeongdong bus no 05
601,5,South korea is truly bless by nature You can ride or hike going to namsan tower It was spring when i came so the scenery is superb It best to travel during springsummeratumn
602,5,Good view on mointaintop But the Seoul Tower is smaller than Tokyo Tower and Shanghai Tower and 101Taipei
603,4,We walked up to base of the tower and back Pleasant climb in a natural setting The top on the hill has some shops and food and some public seats so you can spend some time
604,2,There are very few elevators Once ypu get off the cable car it is nothimg but stairs The veiw is beautiful but not worth the hike Getting on and off the cable car there was nothing but stairs Not sings letting us know There is an elevator from the main road to the cable car stand If yoi have no mobility issues it is worth the trek If you have mobility issues best to stay clear
605,4,My first trip there Good eye opener to see how this being built and its concept The weather was not good during our visit Could really see the outside view But with visiting The ticket price cheaper will be good
606,3,Other than the steep steep walk towards the tower where the padlocks are there wasnt really much to see here The food at the top were limited and pricey Our trip here could have been replaced by another place but what the heck; a check mark for you now that weve seen it  Note the treetops with LARGE bird nests and the walk path that abound with beautiful flowers including tulips  There are many stalls at the top selling assorted merchandise  all pricey 
607,5,I went here wanting to go up to the top but it was a very hazypolluted day so I dont go to the top as you can walk around and see Seoul for free  Great views on a clear day
608,4,Visited with a good colleague and he talked me into visiting on a day with good views It was fantastic; what an experience  On the square at the foot of the tower there are lots of activities
609,4,Awesome site to see while in Korea Its a must see We went to the top and took pictures Theres even the little lock thing that people do You cant miss it theyre everywhere They sell them there so no worries about bringing your own I was told theyre love locks
610,4,Was happy that our guide was able to drive us almost to the top where the views were good but because of the haze rather restricted distant views
611,3,Ive been to many tower view points in my tours Seattle Needle Eiffel Tower the Empire State Building to name a few and here it was a bit disappointing  Were reached the tower towards sunset to see the sun goes down on the city but as the visibility was very poor due to the temperature and the atmosphere we decided to check the tower itself There is a deal for two at 22K W for two tickets  2 drinks and 2 popcorns heavily stuffed with butter and upon entering it looked very strange to the team there that we as two tourists didnt want to get ourselves pictured for an overpriced photo set 1 for 15K W and it goes on  Once we reached up we discovered that it is almost impossible to get a clear sight in the night because of the merchandise and internal lights that these boots are reflecting All the surrounding windows had reflection of everything you see inside people shopping lights of candy stores etc and you could not take a decent photo with those reflections I guess during the day it is much better but trying to compare the pictures shown by the staff of Seoul at night makes you wonder where was it taken on the roof top of from a different building 
612,2,Got off seoul ststion subway to walk to hilton bus stop up hill to find out bus stop a block away from hilton Then bus 402 takes us to 2nd stop which gps said to get off on to find it in middle of no where So we walk back to 1st stop to walk what was around a mile up a 45 degree inclineyes it sucked ass But the best part was it smelled like sewer the whole way When we finally got to the top it was definitely not worth the effort Moral of story is research a better way to the top because u will be sweaty thirsty and exhausted if you take the walking route
613,4,My hotel was not far away so I walked to the cable car station which was easy to find I decided not to walk up the path because I have a bad knee and climbing that many stairs would have hurt I bought a one way ticket for 7000 won I didnt have to wait long for my turn on the cable car only about five minutes around 1045am on a Saturday The trip up is about two minutes in the cable car but they reallllly cram people in that thing The views from the main platforms of the tower were excellent and it was nice to see the love locks as well They have lots of food options there as well I did not pay to go up to the observation deck since I thought it was overpriced especially when you get such good views from the free platforms Please note this is a super crowded attraction so prepare yourself for that I then walked back down since it is much easier going down stairs for me  walk back down took about 1015 mins for me going slow Overall it was worth seeing and you could certainly do it for free if you are fit enough to climb all those stairs
614,5,The view makes the trip up so worthwhile The view is breathtaking Bus trips up to the base are frequent and convenient
615,5,We visited at night and it was an amazing view The city stretches out in all directions It was also cute watching all the couples
616,2,Maybe its Labor Day holiday so there were many peopletourists From the bottom of slope waiting for elevator up to the ticket station  queuing to collect tickets to go up the tower station and finally to top of tower was long long queue and we waited for almost 23 hrs I did not think the night view was that fantastic for the wait it was not worth it for me We also queued an hr to wait for lift to go down Bad experience by the end of the night my legs were aching so much The staff there were not doing anything to make the wait more efficient Maybe it is better if it is not public holiday
617,3,There is quite a bit to do at this location including many restaurants to have a meal However this attraction is at its best only when the weather is clear and the air is clear so you can see afar If the weather isnt so good than it would be a slight disappointing experience and you would miss out on seeing how Seoul is from top with the surrounding mini mountains
618,5,I am thrilled to find cherry blossoms in here Good place for sightseeing and picturetaking although most of the time there were too many tourist in here
619,4,Really beautiful we went during the day however I think at night would be spectacular Also dont go on a day where there is dust as the view isnt good on a day where there is a lot of pollution
620,5,Must visit in Seoul Colder up there wear warmer clothes and gear specially if youre visiting from October to April
621,5,Use the cable car going up you can easily walk down on your way back This site will show you how big and wide and how progressive Seoul is Its really impressive and the site itself is a mix representation of Korea very advance but they have cultural presentations scattered around the area too This is the best place to take selfies and the background views are pretty impressive Dont miss it
622,3,Tried to go 5pm on Sunday It was super crowded At the cable Car they put up a sign saying queue will take 90 min We skipped that and went to the tower A long queue again to go to the observatory But I strongly suggest exploring outside first where the love Locks are instead of wasting time in the queue I didnt know that and regretted the queue
623,5,Really nice place with beautiful night scenery Took a cable car up and the night view was awesome Be sure to lock down your love with a padlock there
624,5,For firsttime visitors and if sightseeing is an important agenda in your visit then you should definitely visit this place For starters it gives you a breathtaking view of Seoul and depending on visibility you can see nearby mountain ranges I assume that it also gives a very nice view at night where you can see the vibrant lights of Seoul City  If you are with your sweetheart you can also venture and put a lovelock here to show your affection to him or her Together with all the other lovebirds whove also done it before you
625,5,Really great views people watching coffee and food options up top We walkedhiked up paved through whats l like a linear garden with fresh air and nice views Then pay to go up to the top the views of the enormous Seoul metropolitan area are outstanding Top it off with the cable car ride down but note thats quickly over
626,3,Only stay up there for a short while Nothing fanciful Head straight to the ticket booth to purchase your ticket as you will be given a number and you got to wait for your number to be called
627,4,A must go place for tourist however if i go again I wouldnt go up the tower Ill just buy the cable car ticket And i reckon the view there is good enough
628,4,There are two ways to go by walk and by cable car We had used walk Many stairs in a beautiful forest full of spring flowers and birds Tired but happy On top was waiting for us N Seoul Tower View from the top is amazing Special when is good weather and visability You can took great photos of Seoul In tower are place yo eat play restrooms Gift shops tax free Also you can leave your love lock Fully recommended
629,5,Once we got off the bus we were surprised by the steep walk up the tower It was difficult especially with a stroller Then when we got to the foot of the tower there was a long line in the elevator and we decided to take the stairs so were very tired when we arrived to the viewing deck The view was wonderful We then paid a ticket to go to the very top of the tower  the view was good but it was very crowded  Please avoid going on a weekend or on a holiday
630,4,I would recommend visiting this place during day time for better photo taking The hotel I stayed in Tmark Grand Hotel is very near to the tower and we got on a direct bus just in front of the hotel Easy and convenient The love lock area is always packed with tourists and quite difficult to find a nice spot to take pictures We only stayed for less than 3 hrs including a short coffee break
631,4,Excited While we were in line for the cable car I thought it will only take us a few mins to hop in Not really  If you want to take the cable car it will be a very convenient journey to the topBut youll have to wait more than 30 mins looping around before you can even hop in I guess its a lot better than walking all the way to the top  I wish they had a warning downstairs before getting the ticket that we will have more 30 mins wait   We were excited for the sunset but we missed it Oh well The view was fantastic up there though
632,4,Waited an hour to go up to the viewing deck that aside the views of Seoul are fantastic Worth the visit just take into consideration waiting times
633,3,Seoul tower offers the most amazing  complete ariel view of the city unlike any other place However one needs to be careful before going up since if it is foggy then its a waste as you wont be able to see much Interesting fact  the tower itself uses lights to indicate whether the visibility is clear or not so its a good practice to watch for the lights and then make your way there You can get to the base of the tower for free which itself is good enough to get a splendid view But if you want to spend money you can pay more and make your way up the tower which as a restaurant with a better 360 view There are two ways to get there  you can trek your way up a nice path or take the bus The only downside is that it is super crowded and you need to jostle for space to get a decent view
634,4,This is a super fun day outespecially if you like hiking We decided to walk from our hotel turned out we were illpreparedlol and there is are welldefined trails with pretty scenery and a couple of reststops where you can buy drinks and snacks on the way up Once there there are a bunch of great photo ops including a pagoda the padlock love fence and of course the tower itself The price to go up the tower is very reasonable if you have kids youll probably spend more at the candy shop at the tophaha and on a nondusty day the views are supreme
635,4,The cable car is fun and easiest way to look at Seoul The queue to get to the cable car is fast and the staff were helpful and attentive to old folks  Only thing is when we got off the cable car on top we need to climb three flights of stairs to get to the tower For people with accessibility issue or old folks like my dad they can take the lift behind the cable station Unfortunately the signage was not obvious and the lady behind the ticketing counter was not conversant in English We only realise when we were leaving the place
636,4,We visited the tower at night hoping for a great view However it was foggy and we couldnt see a thing It was still a fun adventure
637,4,Try to go from evening to night U get a nicer view of the city There is long queue but move quite fast
638,3,Unsure if it was the time we went but the lines were HUGE We caught the elevator up to the cable car the cable car up to the tower and then the elevator to the observation deck There are quite a number of stairs and my poor Dad who has bad knees from an old sporting injury was hurting afterwards Its definitely a tourist trap you get up to the observation deck spend minimal time because its so crowded and then wait longer in the line to get back in the elevator to go back downstairs it hardly seems worth it Good to go once but wouldnt be high on my priority list to go again
639,5,The Hop On  Off Bus makes a stop here Gorgeous view from the top It was a great day weather wise The tulips were in full bloom as well as the cherry blossoms  Dont forget to use the restroom inside at the top to take in another great view
640,5,They provide a shuttle bus from the subway station This bus stop in some points and also reach the tower park area Cost 10000 Won for observatory deck but I bought online in Klookcom because its cheaper half price  Locals bring food and do some picnics in this area I shd bring food here hahaha Well in N Seoul Plaza yes there are many restaurant to choose I eat budaejjigae here and its delicious
641,4,What I liked the most about the visit was hiking our way up to the top Its a nice walk that rewards you with nice views and a few restaurants The views from the top are ok although the smog is not helpful
642,3,Limited interest as very touristic place with many fast food restaurants and gift shops  The panoramic view is nice by clear weather and you can really see the dimension of the city  To do if you have time to waste but not a must do
643,5,This the best view point location from which all can gaze down on the whole city of Seoul But our best memories will be of the restrooms Restrooms were floor to ceiling glass and we got in trouble when there were women in the mens bathroom The men face out and the women face sidewaystotally strange experience
644,5,I got here by subway than catch a shuttle bus no3 to come up here Be there around 330 pm I saw some traditional performance Then walk around the place I brought the eticket from tripcom got some discount The top of the observer floor you can see the Seoul city in 360 degrees make sure go down there on a clear day On the way down I walk to the Library direction very nice cherry blossoms trees the biggest tree I have ever seen
645,5,On top of the tower one will be amazed by the size of this world city Its just incredible Really love to go here when I am in the city
646,4,This place is very nice specially for lovers It has a view overseeing the city which is very beautiful Nice place for picture taking Senior citizens will find it a little bit challenging to climb Must see when visiting korea
647,5,This place is totally worth going up to The 360 view of the city is fantastic There is plenty of room for everyone to get a view
648,5,We rode the gondola to the top of the hill and enjoyed the views from Seoul Tower The souvenir shop and the teddy bear shop were favorites We hiked down and enjoyed the vistas along the way
649,3,The only nice thing is rows of cherry blossom trees going up the to the place on the bus shuttle There are small shops selling ice cream and beverages at the outside of the tower
650,3,We took the cable car to Namsan park It was a uphill climb to the cable car station The view at the lower deck is sufficient for us We did not go to the observation deck Be there early to avoid the crowds as there were bus loads of tourist when we left the place at around 11 plus There are three buses available at the bus stop which can bring you to selected train stations
651,4,Well we do not choose to go up by skycab we walk up from Namsan park it was a right decision we made Namsan park is abeautiful park and nice place to see sunset we visited during the evening and when reach the N tower the night view of Namsan City really make us feel great in cold looking at the nice city night view feel like you empty your mind i think it is one of the best spot for city night view sightseeing in Seoul
652,5,Nice view This is up at the top of a mountain The area has the Lovelocks corner where you see a lot of padlocks put by couples and you can even put one too Theres a store there selling love locks Theres also the beacons and the tower itself which you can go up using an elevator At the top the view is nice You get to see the city view There are also a lot of souvenir shops and food stalls at the top of the tower At the top is a little small so you may notice there are a lot of people beside you  Going to the location Make sure youre prepared to walk uphill here Maybe 1015 mins walk as the bus cant go up any higher Also make sure not to let your children run down this hill because one of the people in our tour group had let her children ran off and they came rolling downhill Good thing there were people who managed to catch the child But please be careful with your children going up or down the hill
653,5,Seoul Tower is an excellent viewing point You will have a nice view of Seoul from the base of the tower even if you do not choose to take the elevator to the top It is quite crowded on the weekends On the weekends they usually have a small flea market there in late afternoon The best way to get to Seoul Tower is by cable car Buying a round trip ticket will be cheaper
654,2,Sad impressions from the observation place with so dirty windows at a sunny week Forget abour taking professional photos here Enter price is cheaper online search on klook
655,4,The North Seoul tower is the best way to see the city and the amazing views around Seoul  Take the gondola cable car up which is near Myeongdong Metro station and you are taken to tower base within 10 minutes  The views at the base of the tower are stunning but you get the full 360 view from the top of the tower  In all a worthwhile few hours
656,1,The view is great but the 90 minutes que to lower elevator and 60 minutes que at the top is not worth it  Go there and enjoy the view from the lower deck for free
657,5,A cheap morning or afternoon activity thats allows you to appreciate the scale and density of the city that is Seoul  They run a tight ship here you are up top in no time  I recommend booing via Klook and simply scanning your pass at a machine to print a ticket; saves a line up
658,5,I took the challenge to hike up for about 3 kms to and from N Seoul Tower  Once you reach the top the magnificent view of the city from afar is worth the climb
659,5,This is a must visit place for couples friends families and even singles The place is full of love lock and the stores sell all these items Good to read what people write from all around the world Lots of tourists and locals Very good vibe
660,5,Get your bearings for this vast city from the top Take the cable car up and a slow walk down with memorable views of the city Specially during spring blossom period
661,5,N Seoul tower is a great way of viewing Seoul Cheap very accessible thru bus or hop on hop off bus We used our Seoul pass to enter Theres a restaurant gift shop and of course their observatory viewing floor Try to use their washroom even in there you will be enjoying the view You can also rent hanbok and get your picture taken thru their photographer I forgot how much is the picture but its a reasonable price
662,5,The walk towards the tower may seem exhausting at first but once you get to the place and see the view of Seoul you regain all that drained energy  The view is definitely breathtaking   The only thing I disliked about it was that we were on a tour group so we had little time to savor the beautiful weather up there as well as the stunning view of the city Oh well there is always a next time 
663,5,We visited the Namsan Tower as part of a voucher deal we purchased The walk up the mountain looked like a lovely and peaceful hike but not an easy climb therefore we took the easy route up via cable car Visit early in the morning to avoid the crowds however the view can still be obscured by morning mist so beware During the time we were in the observatory the mist partly cleared therefore we were rewarded with wonderful views The windows of the observatory tell you in which directly many cities are and the distance However we would of liked to have signs pointing out the Seoul landmarks such as bridges etc as we spent time trying to find these  The love locks are a beautiful attraction You dont need lock you padlock as soon as you see the main bulk of them on the walk up as there are places to lock them all over the site  A must do activity when visiting Seoul
664,5,Seeing the whole Korea was fun Travelling through cable car is more fun too Lots of restaurant to choose from is a plus
665,5,It was an overwhelming experience to see the downtown Seoul especially in the middle of the night when the city lights are colourful we also managed to send a postcard to the post box right at the observation deck Thanks to Klook we managed to get a discount price and save a time
666,5,I usually shy from expensive tower attractions that involve several intervals lining up in queues Mid morning and midday really was not bad for the lines We had no more than 10 minute waits You absolutely MUST go to the bathroom as both genders have private bathroom views
667,4,I It ride on the shuttle bus 5002 in dongdaemon station and from there it was just 15mins It was 10pm already when Ive got here but thanks to the management they still let me in and used my voucher I thought it was not crowded but there still a lot of tourist and locals are going here
668,4,Nice place to visit including the surrounding park an oasis of peace in a huge city Magnificent view over Seoul  with clear sky  You can go either by cable car which is not that impressive or from the other side by bus or taxi directly from metro station meyoudong which costs only about 5000 Won
669,5,Fresh air and awesome view Staying up there in the morning with sunset is just beautiful Its a bit cold for this time but worth it You will have an overall view over Seoul
670,4,N Seoul tower and the surrounding Namsan park and gardens provide a nice break from the busy city Enjoy a walk through the gardens up to the tower or take the cable car
671,4,Nothing spectacular about the tower itself however on a clear day you can see all of Seoul and the surrounding areas and mountains It is a must to visit the toilets which have a clear glass wall and a wonderful View
672,5,We took the bullet elevator all the way to the observation deck and it lasted only 38 seconds or less One would hardly feel it because theres a video showing on the ceiling while its going up The best part of being on the observation deck is the ladies comfort room One wall is entirely made of clear glass and youll see Seoul while you use the commode Weird but great experience We were also able to do the lovelocks and it was fun
673,4,Great view good for tourist to spent time here D  Have variety of food too and money changer if u need
674,5,You can ride the cable car from Myungdong near Sinsegae Dept store or ride city bus which is easier at the bus stop located just in front of from Namsan Hanok Village or Daehan Cinema at Chungmooro metro station
675,4,My husband and I hiked up to Seoul Tower It was a bit of hike; however the result was great The view of the city was great even though it was a bit cloudy There are several restaurants to choose from Great for a few hours our of your day
676,4,We didnt pay for the tickets to go up since the view from the bottom was already nice I took the cable car up to Seoul tower There were so people walk up which was free and they can also saw the view while they were walking We took the cable car down and there was a lift took us to the street See the last photo Overall its worthy to have a look while we were in Seoul
677,4,The second highest point in Seoul city this tower provides a gorgeous view of the city at night The observation deck at the top provides a dazzling cityscape from the glass windows and houses a souvenir shop While exiting the tower I also came across the row of Love Padlock trees and heart shaped chairs which seemed to be quite popular with the couples visiting the tower
678,4,We went at night time and it was a lovely clear evening so the view was good You catch the cable car up If you are a senior 65 or over you get a discount The locks of love are there and there must be millions of them It should take you no more than an hour ago do this activity
679,5,We are from the United States so were not able to really plan this visit around the weather If you go be sure to go on a clear day We were lucky to have great visibility the day we went The locks of love was great as well We had no idea about it before going and were able to participate in it by adding a lock for us Worth going for sure
680,4,Ive been here twice once in the evening and once in the day From the entrance to the tower you can appreciate the cityscape of Seoul and its a great view It doesnt cost much to go up the tower only 10000 KRW per person plus there is a bundle of 2 popcorns  2 beers for 26000 KRW which we availed of The top of the tower itself was quite small in terms of circumference Only housing a candy store and a souvenir shop were located at the main viewing deck with a nonadvertised coffee shop at the lower floor which we wouldve gone to and stayed at if we had only known theyre the only accessible nonrestaurant establishment with seats It was a great experience but its more than enough to go up the tower once no need to do it again and again
681,3,Im sure the views would be nice if it werent for the smog 360 views of the city available Avoid the souvenir shop Utter rip off Was charged 9500 won x 4 for four cards to send to folks back home Thats almost 40 USD Im honestly horrified that they charge such prices but promised some folks I would send a card Never again
682,4,The tower experience itself is quite good IMHO however the Seoul skyline isnt particularly striking eg compared to Busan There are enough interesting things to eat and explore around the tower as well to spend a couple of hours  Tip be sure to check out the restroom on the lower observation deck 4F 
683,5,Although the queue is quite long but on the top of the tower the 360 degree view is just fantastic Beautiful place for sunset
684,5,Very happy we made it to this attraction We got here during sunset and it was great Very busy though so beware of people
685,5,We went on a nice sunny clear day and were able to see all around the city I recommend getting the beer and popcorn adult package you can take it up with you
686,4,You can get a good view of Seoul at both the bottom and the top That is because the tower is located on a mountain that is at one of the highest points in Seoul Walking up the mountain is a nice way to get there but there are also buses from Seoul Station to get to the top of the mountain
687,4,Went to N Seoul Tower for the 3rd time alreadynever fails to amaze me My faves there are visiting the Hello Kitty Island  the Locks of Love So easy to go there from Myeongdong just ride Bus 05 Always enjoyed my experience in N Seoul Tower Till next time
688,4,Got up at 530an to hike from Meyongdong to the top Amazing views along the way Very physically draining You will need to be pretty fit to make Well worth it when you get to the top Took me an hour up and 30 mins down Which included breaks to take photos Cable car wasnt working when I was there but I still would have walked as it didnt open till later Lots of CCTV cameras so felt safe in the dark
689,5,This could be a very romantic place to visit Views are great although it was extremely hazy on the day we visited Not sure how it looks at night but I bet its very nice You can hike up or take the cable car Its definitely a worthwhile visit while in Seoul
690,4,My family of 4 stayed near Seoul Tower and made the mistake of choosing to walk to the tower From the map we are just less than 800m away to the tower But the walk to the tower took us nearly an hour The 1st part was just a uphill walk quite tiring but managable The 2nd part are mostly steps We saw lots of cars parking at the end of the 1st part and some cars parked at the tower From some reviews we gathered there is a bus which we could have taken  The view on top was great The space at the observatory is not big and I was surprised to see quite a no of people  There are quite a few restaurants and cafes at the tower We went to Owls Cutlet and the food was great
691,3,we took the Namsan Circular Bus yellow bus no 05 up to the top of the mountain it was the cheapest mode to get there other than hiking up on your own the view from the namsan mountain was spectacular
692,5,Having visited quite a number of these towers this is by far the best The tower itself is not as tallest but the atmosphere within and around is unbeatable The endless number of padlocks and viewpoints make this a special place Once up the tower you get great views of the city You can easily spend 23 hours here
693,4,If youre into city views I recommend visiting Seoul Tower Unlike the typical skyscraper in every major city; Seoul Tower somehow engages the tourist by setting up multiple activities to partake along the way up Theres multiple platforms to sit or take pictures prior to entering Seoul tower Also theres love locks attached to the fence panels Travelers could take bus or the Gondola 10 USD up to Seoul Tower  Key Note If you arrive late near closing time the gondola that takes you down will have a long line If you want to enjoy your date night and stay up late at night; you could always take the bus down Its safe but its a longer wait for the bus
694,5,Seoul Tower or N Seoul Tower is one of the most romantic attractions that many couples have The couple must come to lock the keys together And also has a beautiful view point Have convenient travel The entrance fee is not expensive People are friendly cute and Has a very clean place
695,5,N Seoul Tower is one of the major tourist attractions of Seoul Considered one of the most beautiful towers in Asia Is a place that has beautiful and varied lighting There is a restaurant on the tower that will turn around every 48 minutes named N Grill When going up to the tower to see the beautiful scenery
696,4,if you have been to other higher places in world this doesnt give you that adrenaline rush bt still its good for one time visit and those love locks are good for romantic evenings
697,5,Actual fact is a quite romantic tower to go especially for couples who want to lock their love up on the tower Is beautiful view from the top and breathtaking too
698,3,Whether it is due to time constraints or the weather is too coldcloudy N Seoul Tower is your alternative to Building 63  With the Seoul Discover Pass youll get to enter the Observatory Deck for free and get 30 degrees view of the city  The surrounding areas at the feet of the tower are nice for photo ops Just gotta find the right spots
699,5,We loved our time climbing from Meong Dong to the tower great to make you feel warm as the snow just fell the night before We loved the view and the landscape
700,4,I love the cable car ride to the top of the mountain I love the magnificent view of Seoul from the mountain The tower is interesting and sell many things from food to souvenirs
701,5,Every previous visit to Seoul had been cloudy or rainy meaning the tower was not good to visit This time was a beautiful sunny day and worth the visit  We went up to the tower in the cable car which was fun in itself
702,4,Overlooking Seoul at N seoul tower despite the very cold weather the place the viewthe scenery was beautiful There were restaurants as well to chill out until nighttime And couples lock their padlock of love onto the railing and to dream that their love will last forever
703,3,I visited Seoul tower with my friends Its just the view from the tower But due to glass reflection was not able to click good pics Just an average place
704,4,If you want a perfect view take the cable car up to the base of the Seoul Tower and walk down the trail to the national library It is around 860m with a stopby to see the view We went there at 2000hrs Very nice  Seoul tower itself going up you wouldnt see best view although you can see a smaller version of Seoul through unwashed windows Up there you can only go in a circle and buy souvenirs For me its overrated  Check my pictures Ive attached for the view I was talking about
705,5,We went there at nightIt was a freezing night we took the cable car 12 min ride When we got there we saw the whole city and the night view is absolutely beautiful Highly recommend to all travellers you should visit at least once in your life time P S Some souvenirs shop there u can buy some postcards the couple locks thingalso restaurant and cafe
706,5,From Hyatt Hotel you can hike going up the tower there is a road not frequently taken but if you love nature you will like the view30min 1hr hike depending on your pace It is best to bring water and wear proper hiking clothes The 800m mark going left and 1400m mark going right was confusing so in between we walked up where you will see a small trail near a housejust use gps and follow direction where the tower is
707,3,One of the place that I looked forward so much but ended up being so disappointed It did not appear as charming and nice as my expectation Ticket is a little on the pricier side as well but the hike up to the N tower was worth it the view of Seoul from above is just breathtaking
708,3,Built on a mountain Seoul tower is a quite high place in Seoul People can see the skyline of Seoul and enjoy the food meanwhile However I have to admit I prefer the skyline of Tokyo or Hong Kong There are no so many skyscrapers in Seoul compared with the two cities Also It is a little far away from the highest skyscrapers like lotte world tower So I dont think there may be best places to see the seoul skyline People can arrive at the tower by the cable car instead of climbing the mountain
709,3,This is one of those obligatory attractions in any city you visit to get a birds eye view of the city  its layout Visiting in Feb when the temperature stayed below 5 degC meant we needed to take the cable car up It was a good experience and not too expensive Surprisingly there was quite a number of visitors but it wasnt very crowded So the cafe and various FB places were comfortable The only issue is that the windows were not fully clean and so it was impossible to get a good selfie picture or any good pictures for that matter
710,5,Visited Seoul tower at nite and presented with delightful displace of light show bathing the tower and lights from surrounding structures down below Mesmerising
711,3,Timing is everything it seems when it comes to visiting outdoor attractions in the winter During my visit to Seoul in February I enjoyed some spectacular clear and sunny days However on those good viewing days my schedule would not permit a visit here to the N Seoul Tower located within Namsan Park here in Seoul South Korea Then I looked into taking a tour to the N Seoul Tower The price was prohibitive However the booking agent for the tour told me that their bus would go to the base of the N Seoul Tower My friends who live here said that you have to walk up a long walk to get to the base of the tower  So I hired a taxi and off we went on a dark gray overcast and snowy day to see the N Seoul Tower I expected the taxi would take me to the top to the base of the tower This was not the case at all I saw the snow covered walk leading up a hill and had to decline a visit  Disappointing Yes indeed But my timing was lousy and I had to be at the airport and wont have another chance to visit the N Seoul Tower until who knows when  What is the point of this review I strongly recommend that you DO NOT OPT TO VIEW THE N Seoul Tower on an day with inclement weather
712,5,This is definitely a mustsee attraction at night This is no doubt about it The views are just stunning amazingly colorful and bright But be aware that you when you take the cable car the price does not include the observation deck of the N Seoul Tower Its only less than USD10 but I thought I was getting a packaged deal when purchasing my cable car ticket
713,5,This is a wonderful place from which to view Seoul We enjoyed strolling the grounds taking in the views trying some virtual reality seeing all the love locks and then taking the elevator up the tower Do make a reservation if you want to eat at one of the two real restaurants otherwise you can get a wonderful burger or coffeedessert at one the selfserve type spots Walking down the path at night was lovelyseeing the city lit up at night was just beauriful Not exactly accessible for those with mobility challenges
714,4,Short waiting time A bit steep and Im not sure its suutable for people with a disability in parts  Cracking views
715,5,very nice view by the way on top of the hill some small kiosks with refreshing drink and food easy access
716,4,I love that N Seoul Tower has some seemingly random combo tickets A trip up the tower with pizza and beer anyone It made the experience more fun and it did seem like you got more bang for your buck Like most of these kinds of attractions Empire State Building CN Tower Space Needle Venices Campanile it is way more crowded than you might be led to believe from pictures movies etc but I still think it was worth it The atmosphere at night was fun and the views were gorgeous
717,3,Queues for 1 hour to boardand the cable car with people cutting queues A better system could be in place
718,5,Had a great trip to N Seoul tower We walked all the way to Shinsegae mall turned left and walked about 5 mins we took the elevator provided Because it was freezing so we gave up walking up the hill all the way to the tower we took the cable car instead The view was spectacular especially during the winter We brought our own keypad lock because theyre selling for much a higher price at the tower Overall the experience was great and we enjoyed it
719,4,The view overlooking Seoul is better at sunset The tower in itself is more impressive at night with all the lights Take the Namsan cable up to have the full experience 
720,4,A must visit place for us since its like an SOP whenever we visit another country Go to their tower N Seoul Tower didnt disappoint us It was a short cable car ride up and when you get there they have the Lovelock platform where visitors make a wish in a padlock and lock it in the railings Its pretty cool and the place is filling upI wonder what it would be like in the next 10 years Since its winter when we visited it was freezing to the point you really wanna get out of there We decided not to go to the tower itself and just enjoyed the view of Seoul in the viewing platform  Its a good place to visit especially if youre in Seoul for a very short visit They have different tickets for the cable car ride and different ticket going in to the tower Quite expensive but you can just stay in the viewing platform and enjoy the view
721,4,A mixture of colorful love keys and skies made it nice picture Get cable car recommended returnway to get there do not forget to try yummy hot fishcake in the winter time on the way back
722,4,We took the cable cart up to N Seoul Tower We didnt actually go inside however just walked around took in the spectacular views We then chose to walk back down and not take the cable car down as we enjoy walking It was a nice walk and along the way there was a cool free workout park there was multiple bench press sit up benches weight machines etc We stopped and did a 45 minute workout before continuing back down the hill
723,5,The views from the tower is amazing birds eye view of the city At night the city looks spectacular Loads of restaurants and shops and the sunset from there is beautiful
724,2,Im not quite sure what all the fuss is about We had to do an uphill walk to the base of the cable car for 10 each then pay another 10 each to go up the observatory which essentially gives you a city view not unlike any other big cities Lots of stairs and walking not worth the effort
725,5,Good place to see Seoul 360 degree Not a crowded place even during Christmas period Will go again in different seasons
726,5,I tried going up to the tower by hiking Do not start hiking later in the afternoon It became cold and dark So i abandoned the hike and tried again the next day 2nd attempt was by taking the bus from Chungmuro St exit 2 Shuttle bus no 02 Only 1200 won Straight up to the tower  The view was magnificent very cold did not buy locks to lock away my romance Few restaurants souvenir stores and my favourite Olive Young store Saw few elderly people had their morning walk up to the tower Such a Refreshing site  Must visit this place Try using the cable which i could not find at that time
727,4,Nice sunny day so we got good 360 view of Seoul Went there on Friday morning so it was not that crowded We took bus 02 from Hanok Village which took us directly up to N Seoul Tower and later took bus 03 which took us to our next destination which was Itaewon Very convenient
728,4,Went there to celebrate my birthday Fees for cable car observatory deck and other attractions are quite expensive however your Seoul tour wont be complete if you dont go to this famous tower
729,3,From Myeongdong subway station you can easily walk your way up a steep road to the cable car station that will bring you up the tower The cable car comes in frequency of 10 minutes and will be filled to its max capacity with people  My family went in the evening and saw the sunset Also the good part about going in the evening is that you get to see the day view  also the night view  Objectively I do not find the view from the top especially amazing But nonetheless still scenic I am guessing most people go to seeput their couple lock There is a mall there that sells souveniors food and other things too
730,5,We went up to the observatory in 30 seconds we can viewing 360 degree city blue house yeouido hanriver and many bridge on river too I taken many pictures at there I was veteran and I also got discount on admission fees I was sorry that I could not take night tour I would like to have a night tour at next opportunity
731,3,Dubbed as the mustsee site in Seoul and a part of all tour packages the tower seems to be overrated Packed with a lot of tourists long waiting line Btw it does offer a great view of Seoul by night
732,5,The Seoul Tower is an absolute must particularly at night It gives you a 360 degree view of the city with its brilliant twinkling lights The signs that indicate what cities lay in which direction are helpful in establishing your spot in the world Its a treat
733,3,I think I will never visit N Seoul Tower again at least not on holiday evenings  Reason 1 terrible waiting time spent 20 minutes for the escalator up to the cable car ticket booth 80 minutes for getting the cable car tickets and getting on the cable car 30 minutes for entering the tower  They limited and controlled the total numbers of visitors up on the bird view area In a word it took me more than two hours to get to the bird view area  Reason 2 poor quality of viewing  On the windows were stains left by visitors Besides the reflection from the lights of the stores were annoying  I have no idea whether a daytime visit during week days will be pleasant or not However Im sure I wouldnt like to visit N Seoul Tower on holiday evenings again
734,5,Not suitable for elderly people that cant walk far and up the hill The parking space for vehicles are way down the hill But its a beautiful place if its not raining and foggy
735,5,We went there before sunset and manage to see Seoul from above coming alove with the lovely lights Plenty of beautiful photo worthy shots in the changing light
736,4,Nice veiw over Seoul but a very long wait for the elevator Visit the skybar and enjoy the veiw It must have been one of the most expensive touristattractions in Seoul Still worth a visit
737,4,Great view of the whole of Seoul but not much to do up in the tower for the price we paid W10000 Nevertheless it was still a nice experience  I would recommend going up half an hour before sunset so that one can catch the view of Seoul both in the day and night view  Theres also a postbox and postcards and stamps sold in the tower so that you can write and send postcards from the top of Seoul ;
738,4,enjoying the sights of Seoul city from a height is the icon of Seoul city the love padlock is an attraction for tourists visiting here facilities available both even for parents and even pregnant women because there is a cable car available
739,4,If you are couple dont forget to bring lock or you can buy it upstairs Buy the lock at the entrance of cable car will be cheaper then upstairs  I went there through cable car Its great and enough for me We dont go to the top of the tower  But playing around at the bottom is enough at least for me there are several restaurant that you can choose
740,3,I went here with a couple of my local friends the queue though omgosh We went there around 7pm and the queue was superrrr long I dont think Im gonna revisit The view at night is nice but I wont spend Another hours standing in long queue like that for just looking at Seouls view at night
741,4,You must go there and remind you to try the lunch buffet at the lower level The price is very good Just around 16 in the Canadian dollar The other lunch buffet is double this price Please try to go there on a sunny day when the view is good too
742,5,Stunning view from the top A little bit expensive for me Food is also good Things selling here is pricey
743,3,We came here in the evening on a Friday night and it was crowded Theres also no taxis that we could take to go back to our hotel  because we had been on a DMZ tour that day  just want to get back to the hotel as soon as we could I think it would be better to come here during the day
744,5,N Seoul Tower is an excellent place to visit with family and friends for any occasion because offers a great view day and night to the city of Seoul The Tower is on top of a mountain and allows the opportunity to go for a walk and observe a large forest around the mountain plus having a delicious treat before going to the top of the Tower Once on top of the Tower you can take some pictures of the city and buy some souvenirs
745,4,You can walk to the tower but its hard up hillwe got the cable car with was 9500won each but well worth it before you go up the tower you can take nice photos of seoulit costs 10000won each to get the lift to the top of the towerthe views are great seeing all seoul right back to the mountainsyou can walk round the platform 360degreethere are lots of shops cafe and places to eat but a little bit priceyit would be hard for a wheelchairbut a must thing to do if your in seoul
746,5,Been visiting Korea for two consecutive years and wasnt able to visit this top spot in Korea snd frlt the need to come back and see this beauty so I did not want to miss seeing this the second time and I love it Very picturesque
747,4,I spent 24 hours in Seoul and this was the first place I went It was night and really cold but the view is good you can see quite a lot of Seoul and the surrounding area Its a very popular place and there are lines to do basically everything like take the cable car to the top of the park take the elevator up to the observation deck in the tower and take the elevator back down
748,5,Having been here twice ; first via coach stop which required visitors to walk up a very steep road up then took cable ride I can say that cable ride is more fun and offer better view KLOOK voucher exchange can be done at Level 5 via few machines Easy
749,4,We went at night on 2018 Boxing Day and it was freezing There is a long line for the cable car going up  down but its well supervised and no pushing  shoving  everyone seemed rather civilised and it made the wait bearable About a 15 minute wait in line either way You get a good view of the city from the top of the mountain We didnt go up the Tower tickets were very pricey but I dont recall the exact price The usual souvenir shop and some eateries at the top go up if you enjoy the view One can also opt to walk up  down and I wouldve considered the walk down if I had time to spare it would have been pleasant in the cold Word of warning though  heaps of taxis waiting at the foothill but do ask if they will use the meter  the first few we asked refused and quoted ridiculous fixed prices  we refused and on the 3rd attempt got one that was willing to go my metered prices We went in a group of 12 and on average it took 3 tries to get taxis that were honest  so its possible
750,4,This is quite a nice place to visit Taking cable car one can view Seoul areas If you are challenging I would suggest you to walk down in order to appreciate more about Seoul However the best time to visit this place is evening after 4pm when the sun on the other side and you can take beautiful pictures Enjoy
751,5,Cable car return tickets cost 8500 won per person and entrance fee to the actual tower was an additional 10000 won per person The elevator had an entertaining projection on the ceiling while going up for 30 seconds The views from the top of the hill are definitely worth it because Seoul is a clean and attractive easy to look at city The windows of the observation deck have names of other world cities and distances to them so you can have your photos taken by your home name Even the toilet cubicles have a view The restaurants at the observation deck are overpriced so just wait until you go out to the terrace where there are several coffee shops ice creamery and a couple of average restaurants We spent some 2 hours all in all Better to buy a one way cable car ticket and walk down the nice paved path
752,4,Visited this place as part of a tour package and spent about 1 hour here The view from Seoul tower is amazing and we were lucky as it was a clear day  The elevator had a nice ceiling video while bringing us up and down Worth a visit if you are nearby
753,4,It takes about 1015mins walk from Myeongdong to reach the elevator which will bring up to the cable car station The cost for round trip for cable car was 8000krw Upon reaching the top of the hill you could decide if you want to go up the tower Even if you decide not to go up you will still get a good view and there are lots of places for taking photos Just like most of the towers you get panoramic view of the city at the top of the tower The ride up the tower was interesting with the display on the ceiling of the elevator
754,4,The N Seoul Tower is a very touristy spot on top of a hill but even though its quite expensive Id recommend it to everyone The place is especially nice for couples because there is a spot where you can buy love locks and hang them up for good luck in a relationship Was nice and Id definetly recommend it for couples
755,5,Spend my time at the Seoul towera lot of places you can go once you reached on top via the cable carNice view Reccomended for all
756,5,You can pay for the cable car round trip or one way or you can ride the bus to and fro the tower The cable car is nothing special but it is very convenient We enjoyed N Seoul tower the view the locks the open space and especially the free hanbok wearing
757,4,We visited this place during winter and I honestly dont have a feel for shopping that time because it was too cold for asian born in tropical country The best thing that you can do here during winter is to have a taste of its street foods
758,4,We took a bus up to the mountain followed by a stroll up the slope to the tower We could view the city not only from the observatory deck but also from the toilet while doing business Its interesting Once done going round seeing city from all angles you could order a cup of coffee sit by the window and enjoy the drink plus views Very relaxing The sight of love locks makes you wonder why people locked their love there Isnt that 
759,4,We made journey but it was worth it They view is phenomenal especially at night seeing the palaces lighten up Very polite people who were guides Advise anybody that is going to wear sneakers It is a good hike
760,5,I personally think the visit is worth the price Had a hotel in Myeongdong so all I had to do was to take a lift to the cable car place You should visit when the sun is setting so youll see Seoul during night dusk and day The inside of the tower is really crowded during that time though You can send postcards directly from the tower which I recommend
761,5,I think Seoul is an identical metropolis It is green  not tall city like suburban or something like that But it is really a metro  full of many transportation and technology Actually I dont like to pay for climbing to see view in high rises like this And some time it was disappointment This time I had read reviews in this Tripadvisor and finally went to From above  you will see this green metropolis clearly It was beautiful In fact the ticket for transportation itself is not expensive But if you want to challenge yoursef  you may climb to the base of the tower with your own feet
762,5,favourite part were the love locks  i loved being so high up and the view was so beautiful spent 3 hours taking beautiful pictures here
763,5,There is a currency exchange machine located behind the Twosome Coffee and beside the restroom  Reminder You need to bring your passport because they will scan it for the limit amount you can only exchange I dont actually know how they do this Wow Korea  The rate is higher than the ones we found at the Incheon International Airport ie 93993950 Airport 10005 N Seoul Tower
764,3,The experience was great but the cable car ride only gets you to the bottom of the tower and then you have to pay again to go to the top of the tower We only ride the cable car because we waited 45 minutes to ride and then it was going to be another 70 minute wait to ride to the top of the tower
765,5,Can view how the city is divided by the river Contrast of old and new building Meantime have the famous corner of locks u can see messages of people to their love 1 or couple Since we follow tour We dont have much time to walk around and read but we have nice view as you can see from my pictures Love the winter view Imaging it full with snow Even more lovely
766,5,Entering the structure through a LED tunnel was amazing Going up the observatory through the elevator was an experience itself with the short video clip watched on the elevator ceiling The whole of Seoul can be seen at every level of the tower but best at the observatory and even through the bathroom A mustvisit place in Seoul
767,4,We took a short cable car to the base of the tower since we had a stroller but it would be a nice walk We did not go up into the tower but the base was a large park area with nice views of the city and mountains
768,5,A trip up N Seoul Tower ensures you appreciate the size and area of Seoul Even after spending a few days here we had no idea of the scale of Seoul until we went up the Tower
769,5,Had an ir temp handheld for this trip First time to get a headache from the weather haha Kids love it  just be sure to be prepared especially if reaching night time Ate at n burger for dinner 
770,4,This area is walking distance from the Myeongdong area about 1520 mins You then have the option to ride a cable car up or to walk up to the Tower The cable car is just a few minute ride so we opted to walk It takes about 30 minutes to walk up much longer for us as we kept stopping to take pictures of the view  We did not enter the tower itself there is a fee but we enjoyed the scenery at the top There are some restaurants at the bottom of the tower
771,3,This was nice to visit but will take you a bit of time would recommend about 23 hours total  If you choose to take the gondola up most popular option you can walk which is about 30 minutes but not sure what the track is like which will cost you 9500 won return We waited in line for about 30 minutes for our tickets and then there was a further wait time of 40 minutes to actually get on the gondola The view from the top was lovely
772,4,There was a performance at the plaza area outside near the gift shop where they let spectators try their hand at piercing a bamboo with a spear Everyone laughed when the warrior the staff haha gasped in awe as one of the ladies managed to pierce it successfully D He had helped her wedge the bamboo before that On an unrelated note the gift shop staff was very stingy with their carrier bag I know they dont have a culture of giving plastic bags but its a gift shop at a tourist spot right
773,5,We had the Discover Seoul Pass and we utilise it got our visit to this atttaction Easily accessible by the shuttle bus which has several pickup points at several convenient metro stations   Good panoramic view of the city   Prob a must see attraction for tourists
774,4,We booked the tickets to the observatory tower at N Seoul Tower through Klook as its cost around SGD650pax much cheaper when compared to purchase onsite If travelling by taxis you have to stop at the cable car ticket booth and travelled up by cable car or by bus Its better to reach around 10am to avoid crowd as the queue for cable car can be long After getting off the cable car please proceed to B1 of observatory tower to print your ticket using Klook barcode issued to you We spent less than 30 mins at Observatory Tower as its very small and crowded I feels this can give a miss The lovelocked area is good enough for you to walk around and take some decent photos of the views
775,3,Good views only if the smog and pollution have cleared out Go after a big rain Buses go to the top but the is no car parking at the top There is also a crowded cable car that will take you up to the top
776,5,It was amazing The cable car was smooth ride We also tried the stairs even though its high The park is nicely clean and the flowers were beautiful and colourful The people were friendly and nice to talk to I highly recommend this place for people who will visit Seoul Korea Top list
777,4,Nice place to visit and one of the main attractions in Seoul Staff are friendly and helpful From the top of the tower you can get 360 degree view of the city Love locks is a common couple activity here N Seoul Tower is mainly used as a broadcast and communications tower
778,3,Wasnt prepared to walk 20 to 30 minutes uphill to reach the cable car station The station was very packed with 2 car rotating Quite slow and packed really packed  The view was fantastis especially it is winter time cool off the tireness from walking all the way up
779,4,You can see Namsan Tower from standing everywhere in Seoul its that huge and built on a slope We went to the very top of this tower which provides a beautiful 360 degree view of Seoul South Korea Another thing that Namsan tower is famous for is locking love locks There must be million of colorful locks
780,5,Good place for memories taking photos  have coffee shop and small restaurant you can see nice view of Seoul from there easy access by bus 030504 have 5 floors as well as the shiny lock you can buy lock twin and place it there for good luck in relation thats ver romantic
781,3,This tower is pretty much the same as any tower you find throughout your travels The unique thing about it is around it Leading up to the tower are hundreds of locks with couples names on them that are locked on the guard railings There are some restrictions for those putting theirs up and if you dont follow their rules your lock will be removed at the end of the night Good view from the tower of the City but like every other tourist stop a bit over priced Entrance fee is separate from the cable car ride getting there
782,5,We decided to go up the tower at about 3pm stayed until 7pm so that we could view the afternoon sun set and night scene since it was winter There is a 10 discount coupon if you buy the Tmoney card from the subway vending machine one discount per coupon Pro  1 Excellent 360degree view of Seoul The toilet has excellent view too 2 There are cafes and restaurants It is generally more expensive as expected 3 Can rent the local costumes for photography  Con  1 May be very crowded during the weekend We went on a Monday and there was moderate crowd 2 Can be noisy if there is a school group  A must visit once if you are in Seoul
783,4,Namsan Tower is one of the key place that my daughter wants to go Watching the drama Deep Blue Sea with Lee min ho drives her crazy for visiting Seoul Its quite a climb after the bus dropped us Wish the bus can reach nearer to the tower Itll be quite tough for the child or elderly to climb up But the view is worth it Had a great time here
784,5,We got the cable car up to the tower and it was incredible seeing the while of seoul  the tower its self was very busy with a large school trip when we were there but still its plenty big enough the locks are amazing there is so many I could have spent all day reading them 
785,5,I recommend doing this in the evening you see the whole of Seoul lit up Its an amazing view definitely worth seeing
786,5,This tower also known as the Namsan Tower is located on the second highest land point within the Greater Seoul area located on the north side of the river It was built in 1971 and is 236 metres high It was built primarily as a communications tower but with lookout facilites restaurants souvenir shops etc included within the design  My partner and I just happened to be staying at a hotel that was within walking distance 10 minutes which is how we made our way to it via SogongRo road on the north side which then proceeds into a freeway tunnel into the hill beneath the tower and its surrounds Just before the tunnel and on the northeastern side we unexpectedly discovered that there is a cablecar that takes you from the aforementioned road level up to the very large park that surrounds the actual tower itself This saves you a somewhat steep walk up to the tower park but if youre into exercise then by all means skip this free ride and walk up instead Its quite steep  There is also road access to the tower and surrounding park that comes in from the south and I assume that you can get a cab up and there are many coach day tours that can also get you to this park and the tower  There is a LOT to see in the surrounding park even before you decide to take the lift up the tower itself The landscaped area surrounding the tower has many restaurants fast food outlets souvenir shops and lookout platformsThe views even just from these large viewing platforms is very impressive and you can spend an hour or more here depending on whether there are special events displays andor entertainment on the day of your visit before you even consider taking the lift up to the top of the tower itself  But the main purpose of your visit still must include a ride in the fast vertical lifts to the tower viewing platforms where you get a 360degree view of Seoul Quite spectacular Again shops and food outlets on this high viewing platform  And I can only speak for the male visitors DO make a point of visiting the male toilets here Men you can stand at a narrow urinal against what is effectively a glass wall and take in the stunning views of Seoul as you relax and relieve and even taking photographs from the mens toilets are encouraged  A visit to the N Seoul Tower should be a mandatory port of call if you have never visited Seoul before
787,5,Wow Amazing value and gorgeous views from the top of Seoul our family loved this tower Should be 1 place to start your visit to Seoul By the way cross Lotte World Adventure off your list absolutely diabolical thats the tip from our kids too
788,5,The family enjoyed the tower and had dinner just outside overlooking the city We went a second time to see the sunset
789,5,What beautiful views of the city that just keeps going We made a half days of it We hiked a little took the tram ate lunch looking over the city and then added a lock to the already thousands placed there Took some amazing photos too My toddlers loved all the colorful locks and the lock trees and the tram
790,4,There are two ways to go by walk and by cable car We had used walk Many stairs in a beautiful forest full of spring flowers and birds Tired but happy On top was waiting for us N Seoul Tower View from the top is amazing Special when is good weather and visability You can took great photos of Seoul In tower are place yo eat play restrooms Gift shops tax free Also you can leave your love lock Fully recommended
791,4,This is a super fun day outespecially if you like hiking We decided to walk from our hotel turned out we were illpreparedlol and there is are welldefined trails with pretty scenery and a couple of reststops where you can buy drinks and snacks on the way up Once there there are a bunch of great photo ops including a pagoda the padlock love fence and of course the tower itself The price to go up the tower is very reasonable if you have kids youll probably spend more at the candy shop at the tophaha and on a nondusty day the views are supreme
792,5,They provide a shuttle bus from the subway station This bus stop in some points and also reach the tower park area Cost 10000 Won for observatory deck but I bought online in Klookcom because its cheaper half price  Locals bring food and do some picnics in this area I shd bring food here hahaha Well in N Seoul Plaza yes there are many restaurant to choose I eat budaejjigae here and its delicious
793,5,This the best view point location from which all can gaze down on the whole city of Seoul But our best memories will be of the restrooms Restrooms were floor to ceiling glass and we got in trouble when there were women in the mens bathroom The men face out and the women face sidewaystotally strange experience
794,5,Seoul Tower is an excellent viewing point You will have a nice view of Seoul from the base of the tower even if you do not choose to take the elevator to the top It is quite crowded on the weekends On the weekends they usually have a small flea market there in late afternoon The best way to get to Seoul Tower is by cable car Buying a round trip ticket will be cheaper
795,4,The North Seoul tower is the best way to see the city and the amazing views around Seoul  Take the gondola cable car up which is near Myeongdong Metro station and you are taken to tower base within 10 minutes  The views at the base of the tower are stunning but you get the full 360 view from the top of the tower  In all a worthwhile few hours
796,1,The view is great but the 90 minutes que to lower elevator and 60 minutes que at the top is not worth it  Go there and enjoy the view from the lower deck for free
797,5,Seeing the whole Korea was fun Travelling through cable car is more fun too Lots of restaurant to choose from is a plus
798,4,We didnt pay for the tickets to go up since the view from the bottom was already nice I took the cable car up to Seoul tower There were so people walk up which was free and they can also saw the view while they were walking We took the cable car down and there was a lift took us to the street See the last photo Overall its worthy to have a look while we were in Seoul
799,5,Very happy we made it to this attraction We got here during sunset and it was great Very busy though so beware of people
800,4,If youre into city views I recommend visiting Seoul Tower Unlike the typical skyscraper in every major city; Seoul Tower somehow engages the tourist by setting up multiple activities to partake along the way up Theres multiple platforms to sit or take pictures prior to entering Seoul tower Also theres love locks attached to the fence panels Travelers could take bus or the Gondola 10 USD up to Seoul Tower  Key Note If you arrive late near closing time the gondola that takes you down will have a long line If you want to enjoy your date night and stay up late at night; you could always take the bus down Its safe but its a longer wait for the bus
801,3,Whether it is due to time constraints or the weather is too coldcloudy N Seoul Tower is your alternative to Building 63  With the Seoul Discover Pass youll get to enter the Observatory Deck for free and get 30 degrees view of the city  The surrounding areas at the feet of the tower are nice for photo ops Just gotta find the right spots
802,5,We went there at nightIt was a freezing night we took the cable car 12 min ride When we got there we saw the whole city and the night view is absolutely beautiful Highly recommend to all travellers you should visit at least once in your life time P S Some souvenirs shop there u can buy some postcards the couple locks thingalso restaurant and cafe
803,5,From Hyatt Hotel you can hike going up the tower there is a road not frequently taken but if you love nature you will like the view30min 1hr hike depending on your pace It is best to bring water and wear proper hiking clothes The 800m mark going left and 1400m mark going right was confusing so in between we walked up where you will see a small trail near a housejust use gps and follow direction where the tower is
804,5,This is definitely a mustsee attraction at night This is no doubt about it The views are just stunning amazingly colorful and bright But be aware that you when you take the cable car the price does not include the observation deck of the N Seoul Tower Its only less than USD10 but I thought I was getting a packaged deal when purchasing my cable car ticket
805,4,I love that N Seoul Tower has some seemingly random combo tickets A trip up the tower with pizza and beer anyone It made the experience more fun and it did seem like you got more bang for your buck Like most of these kinds of attractions Empire State Building CN Tower Space Needle Venices Campanile it is way more crowded than you might be led to believe from pictures movies etc but I still think it was worth it The atmosphere at night was fun and the views were gorgeous
806,4,A must visit place for us since its like an SOP whenever we visit another country Go to their tower N Seoul Tower didnt disappoint us It was a short cable car ride up and when you get there they have the Lovelock platform where visitors make a wish in a padlock and lock it in the railings Its pretty cool and the place is filling upI wonder what it would be like in the next 10 years Since its winter when we visited it was freezing to the point you really wanna get out of there We decided not to go to the tower itself and just enjoyed the view of Seoul in the viewing platform  Its a good place to visit especially if youre in Seoul for a very short visit They have different tickets for the cable car ride and different ticket going in to the tower Quite expensive but you can just stay in the viewing platform and enjoy the view
807,4,A mixture of colorful love keys and skies made it nice picture Get cable car recommended returnway to get there do not forget to try yummy hot fishcake in the winter time on the way back
808,5,I tried going up to the tower by hiking Do not start hiking later in the afternoon It became cold and dark So i abandoned the hike and tried again the next day 2nd attempt was by taking the bus from Chungmuro St exit 2 Shuttle bus no 02 Only 1200 won Straight up to the tower  The view was magnificent very cold did not buy locks to lock away my romance Few restaurants souvenir stores and my favourite Olive Young store Saw few elderly people had their morning walk up to the tower Such a Refreshing site  Must visit this place Try using the cable which i could not find at that time
809,5,Having been here twice ; first via coach stop which required visitors to walk up a very steep road up then took cable ride I can say that cable ride is more fun and offer better view KLOOK voucher exchange can be done at Level 5 via few machines Easy
810,4,We went at night on 2018 Boxing Day and it was freezing There is a long line for the cable car going up  down but its well supervised and no pushing  shoving  everyone seemed rather civilised and it made the wait bearable About a 15 minute wait in line either way You get a good view of the city from the top of the mountain We didnt go up the Tower tickets were very pricey but I dont recall the exact price The usual souvenir shop and some eateries at the top go up if you enjoy the view One can also opt to walk up  down and I wouldve considered the walk down if I had time to spare it would have been pleasant in the cold Word of warning though  heaps of taxis waiting at the foothill but do ask if they will use the meter  the first few we asked refused and quoted ridiculous fixed prices  we refused and on the 3rd attempt got one that was willing to go my metered prices We went in a group of 12 and on average it took 3 tries to get taxis that were honest  so its possible
811,5,A trip up N Seoul Tower ensures you appreciate the size and area of Seoul Even after spending a few days here we had no idea of the scale of Seoul until we went up the Tower
812,3,This was nice to visit but will take you a bit of time would recommend about 23 hours total  If you choose to take the gondola up most popular option you can walk which is about 30 minutes but not sure what the track is like which will cost you 9500 won return We waited in line for about 30 minutes for our tickets and then there was a further wait time of 40 minutes to actually get on the gondola The view from the top was lovely
813,5,We had the Discover Seoul Pass and we utilise it got our visit to this atttaction Easily accessible by the shuttle bus which has several pickup points at several convenient metro stations   Good panoramic view of the city   Prob a must see attraction for tourists
814,3,Our trip started when we walk from myeong dong to the 45 degrees train at foot of the hill its free but works like a lift sometime it could get over crowded Then reaching the top we proceed to buy our ticket for the cable car tower there was no queue when I was there but I can imagine the freezing cold waiting in line to buy the ticket better use klook app and get some discount or buy at the machine Still we need to queue going up the stairs to the cable car more like cable BUS there are 2 BUS one goes up one comes down They will crowd about 20 people or so into the STANDING only BUS If you are unlucky enough you get squeezed into the middle of the BUS and see nothing but other peoples head So I suggest that if you moved towards the door and the BUS is still not full stand aside for other people to board you rush in to the next ride for prime view During cold season when you reach the top it is freezing windy so be prepared for the open air walk Bring your own lock if you do not want to buy the LOVE LOCK at the top of the hill Put your lock and throw the keyinto a box provided unlike the romantic movie where you throw it into the forest The tower ticket is way too expensive and I think day time is better because the night scene can hardly be seen with lots of souvenir store lights reflecting against the windows so you have to press your head against the glass to really see night scene of seoul I didnt get to try the food so no comment on that Sit around for a while enjoy the noisy tourist taking photos and shouting children trek down hill if you feel like it should not take more than an hour
815,5,Heres the scoop  dont take a taxi Just take bus 02 or 05 from some areas around the city including Myeongdong and it brings you all the up to the base of the tower Its only 1200 for adults 350 for kids Same thing when you are returning back The cable car is 7000 one way for adults and connects from the base of the tower to a middle station For us we have been in many before and it didnt justify the short ride Spend some 115 hours at the base of the tower and take in the beautiful views of the city The weather was great and we took lots of photos And we didnt pay to go up the tower because every country has a talk tower and its pretty much the same 
816,2,Bought the combo which includes the N burger set plus observatory admission Observatory was okay View is nice but the kids found it too boring so we were out in less than 15 mins We didnt realise that taxis are not allowed into the area The taxi driver took us to the cable car station instead There are shuttle buses going in and out Price is 1200 won per person regardless of child or adult Prepare exact as there will be no change given  The burger set meal was a bad experience Burger was so so The staff did not allow us to change drinks Was told to clear the table after we are done with the meal  which we happily did but while throwing the stuffs away we were given death stare by the staffs as we clearly did not know which rubbish should go into which bin If you expect tourist to clear their own tables please dont give us a bad attitude when we try to do it to our best understanding Once we got the the restaurant and handed them our coupon for the burger set the staff rolled her eyes and told another person to serve us Seriously Given a rating of 2 for the view
817,5,Even though it was a very hot day the view from the top was breathtaking Beautiful sight of Seoul at night Long wait for the cable car to go up Sat nite and we decided to walk down after Overall its worth it Dont miss this if you are in Seoul
818,3,Standing 237m atop of Namsan Mountain N Seoul Tower also known as Namsan Tower is a must see when youre visiting Seoul  Granted although it was stunning to get a view of Seoul I personally can think of more places that I would like to visit in this amazing city However dont let that deter you from visiting the tower as it is a big landmark of Seoul Its a lovely experience to have and say that youve been there
819,4,We climbed from the foot to the top its a pleasant walk though may be steep and strenuous for some The path is well paved and theres handrails on the side Theres a love locks area for lovers to lock their love there Nice place for photo taking and crowded too Though we didnt go up the N Seoul Tower we managed to get a birds eye view of the surroundings We could see our hotel in Myeongdong and the coloured leaves around Well worth the effort to climb
820,3,Reach this area via cable car Came around 5 in the afternoon and the line in the cable car was long but moving Reach the tower around sunset and by the time we reach the love locks it started to get dark We have a love lock on hand and found a spot for it Took some photos ate some snacks and went to the observatory There is also a line to reach the top of the tower During our visit the place was really crowded and going back via cable car was also the same I guess when you visit this place you should have enough time to spare or else you wont enjoy it as it feels like everything was hurried because of the crowd
821,5,i took the cable car to namsan where the tower is located  there is a nice park there with great spots to take picture with bird view of seoul in the background they have a space like elevator that takes you to the top and you have a 360 view of the city  i had buffett lunch in the restaurant downstairs which was very good  i left back to the city with the cable car  must see  great view 
822,4,Popular with tourists; expect some crowd Que for cable car was long at the time but it does move at a reasonable pace A nice short ride by cable car Go up the tower observation deck and the view there is fantastic There is a Cafe and a souvenier shop where I bought some unique and cute postcards They sell stamps Drop in their mailbox so convenient
823,4,Walking up the hill to the tower on a Sunday morning was a great way to see the people of the city out for there health and enjoyment The views from the overlooks on the way up the hill were beautiful and the foliage was in full color
824,5,This is a fun trip starting with the free funicular ride then cable car to the base of the tower It is busy but like everything in Korea they are very efficient so even though lines were long we really didnt have to wait for extended period The views from the tower are outstanding especially if you go just before sunset so you get the daynight aspect its a little expensive but I really enjoyed the experience even though I have done similar towers in other countries
825,4,This is a great area to visit during day or night They have great views of the city You can see it from the top where there is a 360 degrees viewing floor with windows all around There is an area u can hang your love locks to commemorate your visit or for your significant other  I think a must place to visit is the bathroom in the tower You get an amazing view while you use the bathroom at least in the womens
826,4,i have been visited N Seoul Tower for two times people can see the busy city from the top of the tower people can take a walk from the well built mountain tracks from tower back to entrance i tried to walk with my friend once in March there were cherry blossoms along the track very beautiful and leisure
827,4,Cool dont forget to drop by their toilets They have the most beautiful view hahaha will recommend
828,5,The Seoul Tower is beautiful You have to walk a ways to get up there but it is beautiful The revolving resturant is there as well
829,4,Although it looks awesome in the night dont go on weekend nights The walk uphill to the cable car ride was long and tiring and estimated waiting time was 90mins and additional waiting time up the tower was 70mins A lot of time wasted
830,5,This is the best couples ticket in the cityEven the cable car from the street if you dont want to walk up a lot of stairs and the gondola ride to the tower are a fun with lots to see Great place to walk and hold hands when you get to the top Love locks everywhere so dont forget yours Bring your camera for some of the best views and shots in the city Fun for everyoneGreat food and drink at fair priceThere was a band rocking out by the base the tower so atmosphere was very coolTo get the best bang for your buckor Won go during the day and leave at nightThis will give you the best of both worldsEnjoy
831,5,Its nice to get away from the busy city right before sunset and also enjoy the city lights from above I like starting my walkhike from Grand Hyatt through botanical garden
832,4,You have three options to access the tower first you can take the cable car both ways second you can take the cable car one way and walk the other or third you can walk up the hill to the tower and down back  We took the cable car both ways and we were glad we did as it rained heavily shortly after we got down from the tower  The tower offers a great views of the city and it is very beautiful
833,4,Its quite a climb from the where the bus drops us off and up to ground level of the tower  so make sure youre ready for a hike wear comfortable shoes The view from the grounds below and at the top of the tower is magnificent during the day or night if you get clear skies I was lucky enough to be there when sky was clear We had a buffet dinner at the top of the tower I would say the view was more magnificent than the food
834,5,i went to Namsan tower 3 times when i was in Seoul because i loved the view so much you dont even need to go into the tower itself to see its so pretty and unobstructed if you go in the early evening youll be able to see the city light up so so pretty
835,4,We went there with the cable car which is a very smooth ride to the the top of the hill where the tower is located We bought round trip tickets but you can easily go down walking and buy only a one way this is to go up the hill and the tower is not included Up in the hill you can take walk and enjoy the view There many padlocks put there by couples The visit to the tower costs extra but you can take only elevator or elevator  2 beers  a big pop corn there are 3 different packages The ride in the elevator is fast and with a small movie on the ceiling We went during the day but can imagine that at night must be fantastic Worth it to visit
836,4,We took taxi from the Hotel Shinshin and arrive at our first line to take a cable car up to our second line to take the gondola up the tower You can walk all these parts if you feel so inclined The walk from the gondola building to the tower being the longest Once at the tower there are many restaurants and shops and for an additional 10000 won to go to the top of the tower another line Once at the top of the tower the view is amazing but you wait in another line to come down to the gondola buildingone line to come down on the cable car Sorry for being somewhat a downer about the lines All the lines did move quickly for the amount of people Saturday is not the night to go is my point The rest of the experience was wonderful the sites were amazing and well worth the visitTake enough money so you can do everything you want
837,4,Better go here at night time so that you can enjoy the night lights  Also you might want to go up here on the left side road than the one on the right since its less steeper I suggest for those tourists with seniors or young children in tow to go up via the left road since you can go up to the tower through their elevator  Padlocks are pretty expensive if you purchase it there so you might want to purchase one before going here
838,4,Our family had been to a no of towers not too different this one Kids loved it maybe the icecream There is a place for lovers to place a lock to secure their loveLOL Not muich to do good view as usual though
839,5,The N Seoul Tower is awesome There are great views to be seen I highly recommend visiting this iconic place when in Seoul
840,4,It is a cool place to just walk around At the top of the tower you have the distances to most home countries When I went you could get a free photo by playing a match the image game We also took the regulars tower photo and they emailed us the jpegs of all the pics even though we only got a printout of one At night everything is lit up and without paying this would still be a nice experience
841,5,You get exceptional views once you get to the base level of the tower  without actually going further up So if on a tight budget you do not need to go all the way up There are restaurants and arcades inside so you should be able to keep the family entertained
842,4,N Seoul Tower is a nice place to take photos and see the magnificent view of the surrounding area We took bus number 2 from Chungmuro station as a family member was not too keen on taking the cable car Besides the view there are also a lot of good food options when you get there
843,3,We did the cable car and elevator to the top of the tower Total cost is about 20USD a person and takes at least 3 hours The view at night was pretty cool but not a must see If you have spare time or just like towers and cable cars like me then go ahead and spend the time  money Otherwise you can take a public bus close to base of tower then walk around the grounds to get some good views and pictures Skip the elevator to tower observation and walk back down to bus Total cost is 3 and takes less than one hour
844,4,You can walk there from downtown and get the free funicular to the cable car  the view at the base of the tower is as good as the top of the tower and theres actually a few things to do prior to going up the tower I would recommend potentially not paying the 10000 to go higher up in the tower if money is tight  but still enjoyed it
845,5,The place is worth visiting and U should prepare your camera as the place is picturestic  U have to take a cable ride to the top and then another ticket to go to the top floor for the unforgettable view 
846,5,We went to the top  night Restaurants require advance reservations and probably that you not be as bedraggled as we looked when we arrived after hiking Namsan on a hot  humid day D  Worth seeing the view from the top particularly at night Can get crowded
847,4,N seol tower is one of the favorite tower to visit A lot of beautiful view to see around the tower
848,2,I dont recommend people to visit as the sightseeing is not good enough and I take a couple of hours to wait for the tram to get there And I only spend 20 minutes to see the sightseeing You wont want to see this after you have been to Victorias Harbour in HK
849,3,We had to wait for a specific bus that could bring us to the top quite odd they dont allow taxis there Beautiful view of seoul at night wish we could stay longer as it wasnt included in our tour group itinerary so we went on our own at night Mightve been nice to see it during the day
850,3,The Namsan Tower was built in 1972 and is the second highest point in the city at 236 meters Inside you will find restaurants food courts and observation decks It is located in the middle of Namsan park
851,5,On a clear and not too smoggy day the views of Seoul were fabulous Even though the Tower and the area around the base of the Tower are highly commercialized the 360degree views were worth it The views from the washrooms were great too  Upon entering the Tower you can get your photo taken then its photoshopped onto a background with the Tower which you can buy up at the Tower There are several restaurants and a coffee shop up at the Tower A candy store and a gift shop are also located in the observation deck of the Tower You can dress up in a hanbok and get your photo taken too  The area around the base of tower is covered with love locks There is a vending machine that sells love locks at the base There is an arcade and a virtual reality room at the base along with a restaurant and other food outlets
852,4,this place is good enough to take pictures but the road to this place is quite tiring because there is a fairly steep incline  this place has a nice souvenir shop at the top if you are a couple then can put a padlock of love so that the couples wish materialized this tower is south korea icon so if you visit seoul then you must come to this place
853,4,Nice place to view the city view of Seoul Just take the cable car or walk up the trail to the top Nice view
854,4,We took the cable car up and take note you still need to hike up the stairs abit before you reach the base of the tower We did not experience the tower itself but mainly there for the love locks and experience Buy the superbly delicious churros icecream or rainbow icecream from the cafes there and take a sit at the viewing gallery where there are high chairs for you to sit like a bar and enjoy the magnificient view while enjoying the sweet treat Its FREE  We went to the Hanbok Cultural Museum at the basement and had a fantastic time but that is another review
855,4,To be honest it quite crowded place however 360 view is great Note due to glass window to take a good pictures is very limitedWorth visiting
856,5,The Namsam Tower is a must see destination when visiting Seoul It has an amazing voew both day and night and most of all it is the perfect place to lock your love with your special someone ;
857,5,We didnt plan on visiting the tower that day We got lost and found ourselves going that way We sure did a lot of walking up hills that day including up the steps to the cable cars level as the elevator car wasnt working when we first got there However the views were worth every step Walk 360 degrees around the viewing area and be amazed The view from the womens bathroom wasnt too bad either
858,3,We visited the observatory Hello Kitty land and Ssentoy Museum It is worth it if you travel there and visit all 3 places in the building We did not go to the place with locks as the weather was very hot and we werent interested
859,4,Worth the trip to the top There is a funicular to the cable car station which we took ages to find _ but it was worth looking for it The views in the cable car are alright but nothing compared to when you get up the tower There is also a HK Island museum type of Hello Kitty and a toy museum We bought the ticket that lets us into all three while we were there You can skip this if you dont have interest in these things but Im a child at heart so I loved it
860,4,Nice view of the city but not worth queuing and paying to go to the top Tickets arent expensive but the view in the tower is the same as what you get outside and there isnt anything much or special in the tower  insanely long queues Take a bus up because its a steep walk up One of the locals actually told us we can WALK from Myeongdong Glad we didnt
861,3,I happened to watch a few shows and videos introducing the tower I suppose the experience of getting there would be cute and romantic but it didnt give me that feeling We went during sunset and was able to see the night view of Seoul However I think its not a very good place to look over Seoul
862,5,Obviously you go here for the panoramic view If at all possible choose a clear day and you can see for miles Come with your sweetheart and place a lock on the tunnel of love or one of the many sculptures provided to do so  Note if you buy a souvenir picture they give you a free digital download which is a nice touch  Secondary note even if you take the bus instead of hiking up there is a pretty steep road to get to the tower Be prepared
863,1,Since in april and may weather is smokey and rainy You wont be able to see any viewplus the pollution clouds coming from mainland chins
864,5,We decided to go during the day  and this meant beating the queues We had no waiting time at the ticket office and we went straight up and enjoyed the view It is lovely to be able to see the whole city laid out before you and be able to distinguish its different areas I am sure the night view is great as well but I can definitely recommend a day trip  I would suggest getting the cable car up and walking down because although not steep it is a long slow rise to get to the tower If youre like us  enjoy walking but maybe not in the best shape  then your legs are sure to be achy And the cable car ride does offer a lovely view thats worth paying for Inside the tower you can pick up souvenirs possibly slightly overpriced eat at restaurants quite dear or perhaps enjoy a drink at the Twosome cafe We had beer and cake there and enjoyed the view for a surprisingly reasonable price  One thing to look out for are performances at the bottom of the tower Theres quite a large square with viewpoints alongside it When we arrived some swordfight demonstration was going on Worth staying behind a few minutes for if its happening
865,5,it is like the iconic tower in seoul that u simply cant miss i have been to there for like 2 times already so i didnt go up the tower it was nov and we missed watching sunset when we arrived still a lovely and beautiful place to visit
866,4,We did our usual hoponhop off bus on our first day visiting a new city Seoul Tower was one of the first stops Excellent way to take a birdseye view over the city and surrounds We were lucky to have a clear sunny day we learned that it can get fairly smoggy andor cloudy in Seoul Our hotel was at the base of the Namsan hill in Myeongdong so the tower became a good home landmark when wandering and becoming lost in the enourmous city I am pleased we visited Seoul Tower on the first day of our visit to Seoul
867,4,A great view of the city and landscape Noting the features from past and present Very pleasant staff at all points of interest The restaurant is pricey 12000 for a steak dinner great if you go in planning such Walking down is worth the trip many more sights to see points of interest and history of the wall and region
868,3,It is easy to get here using public transport but it takes time so be sure to check the weather first otherwise youll miss the view  I arrived in clear sunshine but in the next 45 minutes the cloud cover increased so I had very little time to see everything out the windows You can see a long way when it is clear  It takes a while to come back down the tower too  not sure why but there seemed to be loads of people lining up to go back even as more arrived in the lift  N stands for Namsan in the title
869,5,I fell in love with Korea the first time I visited it and I knew I had to come back One of their popular tourist destinations is N Seoul Tower My husband and I hung our love lock by the tower and wrote it with our names on it It felt great Its also a good idea for friendship not just for couples Locks may be bought from the store near the tower
870,4,I went there a few weeks ago with my boyfriend and I have to admit the view is quite extraordinary I really enjoyed the different activities too even if I didnt feel like paying extra for some like the Teddy Bear Museum I think it is a bit disappointing that Seoul is most of the time foggy so the view can get a bit limited on some days but I was lucky with my visit Definitely a must especially for couples
871,5,Ive been there in first week of May Nice weather and cool to visit there at that time Located on Namsan Mountain and Its not that difficult to take bus to get there Terrible of long queue to take bus to get back down Its not worthy for 10 to go up But great place for the moment of Romantic time with your Love  By the way 10 for pad locks that was sold as souvenir to lock up on the romantic area there
872,5,We went there on our anniversary and totally enjoyed the evening There is souvenir shop too which is pricy Italian cuisine restaurant serves great food
873,5,The view from the N Seoul Tower is fantastic You can see all off Seoul in every direction Take a walk around the park for a pleasant walk leftbound around the park starting from the Namsangol Hanok Village Then it is a 35 km nice walk in the park with a not too steep walk Or you can go up alongside the cable car which gives to a mot of steps
874,5,Second tallest tower in Seoul and its a love lock location The tower have 5 f And each of the floor have its own attraction
875,5,N Seoul Tower is worth the visit Although we didnt climb to the top of the tower we spent time watching the sunset just outside of it The views of the city from the park around the tower are well worth the visit I would recommend taking a bus to the top Walking up to the top is doable although tiring but the views on the climb up or down are well worth the trek
876,5,The scenic view made it less tiring to climb the steep road to the tower When you get there theres so many things to do and to look at besides the tower itself You would not mind the crowd because I think its better when theres a lot of people around
877,4,North Seoul Tower is pretty much a must see when you are in town  Like the CN Toer in Toronto or the Space Needle in Seattle You just pretty much have to do it Great view We went in the early evening and saw things in daylight and night light One thing that we didnt realize was that its kind of a romantic place fire couples to go and place a lock with their name on it on the fence Locks are available to purchase there or bring your own Food is available there Anything from grap and go good to sit down resturant Take the cable car to the base of the tower
878,5,Namsan Tower is really perfect place for seeing Seoul from topif the weather is clear daily time You can reach here by Bus cable car or on foot One of the the best choice is cable caroperating hour 10002300  Fare Roundtrip Adults 8500 won  Children 5500 won  Oneway Adults 6000 won  Children 3500 won it can be changeable year by year There are lots of coffee shops souvenir shops or restaurants There is fun museum you can take pictures a lot inside Dont miss it By the way you can eat something inside tower but little expensive and not tasty for me You have to catch traditional performance also 1500 everyday Ah by the way padlocks are everywhere  so hang some of them and write your love story
879,4,We walked from Namsan park to the N tower and take the cable car down We enjoy the walk cause the view on the way up is very nice we stopped many times to take photos Strongly recommend people to go there Very chill
880,4,Every city has its iconic tower and this is Seouls The panoramic views here even from the parks are simply beautiful especially during sundown The breeze is lovely too It can get quite chilly at times basically in all seasons but summer Probably the most famous thing here is the love locks where couples can buy locks and write messages on them to lock them in dedicated sections Its quite pretty with all the different coloured locks Theres a cable car ride as well which could be worth the trip even though I did not personally experience it
881,3,We visited n tower today The place is magnificent You can reach by two ways  Either the bus or the cable car We have reached using the cable car which was a bit hard traveling with a toddler and a stroller  To reach the cable car u have to ride a veichel up to cable car Tickets are for both 1 or two ways Adult round trip  8500 Children under 3 are entering for free  Once you reach the cable car you need to fold your kids strolled  Ride it and then carry it for a very long stairs  Along with your toddler or baby  As access for wheel chairs and strollers are not available which is really disappointed  We didnt actually get into the tower We spent the time around the plaza  Which is consisting of 5 stories I have seen some restaurants with nice view  We were actually looking for the park but not able to reach it as google map services in Korea is so bad and you can not reach using the walking option 
882,4,Easy to go Buses stop at the carpark so you can walk to the tower But the walk way to the tower is going up the hill so that quite hard for elderly people The tower view is beautiful you can also look aroun the tower
883,3,View from the tower is average View of tower itself is better All souvenirs are extremely expensive compared with other places in Seoul Here can be visited with last priority if time is limited
884,3,We went to N Seoul Tower after our palace trip I can honestly say that the place is overrated They have this area where couples can put locks and write something on the locks i guess a wish that the relationship lasts long Forgot how much i paid but i feel that it was more than what the place offers But we went anywherewent for a train and a bus ride which was very easy to follow Still worth a go but again is a little overrated And the locks being sold onsite costs between 65008500w A little pricey
885,5,This is one of the best places Ive visited during my trip in Korea The place has a full view of the City THis is also the place where couples place in their love locks to seal their love as they say Nice picturesque place Every view is worth taking pictures Must see in Seoul
886,5,A great place to visit at night We went to 5th floor for observation deck only The admission fee is KRW 1000000 but we booked thru klook where it more cheaper We went there by bus where you may take subway line 3 Dongguk University Station Exit 6 take the bus 020305 Fee is KRW 120000 by cash or KRW 110000 by Tmoney card What impressed me was you can have a view in restroom as well which is also called as sky restroom
887,4,It was not a very clear day but from the top you appreciate how expansive Seoul is There are great vantage spots for pictures and of course selfies
888,4,You could either go here by walking or using the cable car which costs around 8000 won for round trip Its actually free to roam around the place and look over seoul if you have enough budget and money to spend you could avail the 10000 won access to the top Is it worth it Yes for the view but if you have a lot of children avoid When you get to the viewing deck you have elevator access but upon exit you have to go one floor down and you have to carry everything Imagine When youre a large group I suggest you keep that money for food
889,4,We went up the tower after our dinner at foothills and was enjoying the walk up the hills You can also take a cable car to the tower if you dont fancy flight of stairs There are cafe if you want to sit and enjoy the view while finishing a drink  popcorn
890,4,Visited as part of a halfday multisite tour There are nice gift shops and snacks in the tower and once you go up there are some great shows by performers and breathtaking scenery to take in One of the highlights of my trip
891,5,This 360 degree view of the city should not be missed We were dropped off near the top by our tour bus and walked up the last section to the tower Views on all sides are spectacular and give you a sense of the size and scope of the city You can even see some of the old city wall There is a cable car available but on the sunny Sunday we were there was at least an hour wait You can also hike up to the top but we didnt have enough time to do this either
892,5,Good to do for about two hours because theres a lot to do downstairs from the tower and its great to see the tower at night and in the day
893,5,It opens late and offers amazing view of the city We mapped it and ended up taking the bus and hiking to the tower The hiking trail was well lit clean and well maintained It was an easy and good hike however I wouldnt recommend doing it at night like us as it was a little spooky because there was no one The other more expensive less time consuming option is to take the cable car There are some restaurants at the tower It wasnt too crowded when we were there and city views are always amazing even the bathrooms has views We paid 10000 krw each if Im not mistaken only to enter the observatory however there are other packages available While exiting there are lots of love locks along the pathway and trees If you wish to leave one behind do bring your own
894,4,We went to the top via cable but it is nothing spectacular If you can walk the experience will be much better and the view is great We didnt go to the actual tower but just hang around the bottom around where the love locks are ended up reading the messages left It was a great experience and overall unexpected
895,4,This is the place you should start your stay in Seoul Get a touristmap orient you self on the map make a plan for what and where you want to go during your stay and bring with you this map and plan during your visit in the twr Its great to walk through the city when you go to the twr since you can see the twr from amost everywhere The place it self is a bit crowded and a lot of candy and other stuff to buy Take the cablecar down toward west and visit mayongdong shopping market area Its about 510 minutes walk downhill from the cablecar stop If you have time it is a nice walk up to the twr
896,4,We didnt take the cablecar to the tower we hiked It took us about 15 hours to reach the top with young children Once there at the tower you can shop or eat Also one of the levels of the tower has the oocks of love walls trees Dont worry if you forget your lock they do sell them there for a decent price There is also a hello kitty plac there were you can walk in the oife of hello kitty
897,5,You can get to the tower by foot by bus and using the cable car The view up there is breathtaking at any time of the day if youre in Seoul you should go there at least once
898,3,This was neat but we live in Seattle and it was very Space Needle like The ride to get up there was forever long and thats just to the base of the tower Id recommend this as a novelty but beware of the crazy business of this place
899,3,Good view of the city Although it is open year round avoid it on a holiday We had a 40 minute wait for the cable car 8500 for round trip cable car and another 10000 to ride to the top of the tower Several food choices at the base of the tower and all the way up too Can also walk up to the tower if you are feeling energetic
900,4,The N Seoul Tower is a bit dated but a definite stop to get a birds eye view of just how massive Seoul is in terms of sheer volume of buildings and area If I did return I would choose to walk up to the tower a great way to get in a little fitness and avoid the overcrowded cable car ride The tower itself boasts places to eat a paid museum for Hello Kitty and a toy exhibit gift shops and a Starbucks A little tacky as far as the love locks goes but still a cool place to wander
901,4,It gives you a good view of the city I think the view at night is better compared to day time Can easily take the Bus 5 from Myeongdong and then walk up a bit to the tower Found out that the colour of the tower depicts the quality of air in Seoul Blue is the best quality
902,4,very nice view from above touristy place but still a relaxing place to visit got food options though it maybe a bit pricey nice experience
903,3,Went here on our first day in Seoul It was a steeped walk going up to the Tower and during that time the weather was foggy Didnt see much of the view we are not just lucky enough since the weather was not so cooperative
904,5,Everything a kdrama fan expected and received Wonderful view of the Han river and the city at night
905,4,Nothing much to see Easy to get there by bus Go there at night Only candy stores and souvenir shops on the viewing deck Although its nice if you want a view of Seoul
906,4,Worth a visit when your in Seoul Not too expensive and our ticket included a drink and some popcorn which was nice to sit and enjoy while watching the sun set over Seoul
907,4,Visited N Seoul Tower on a Thursday afternoon around 2PM There werent any crazy lines for either the cable car up to the tower or the observatory I suggest to purchase observatory tickets in advance to make the process a bit faster you cant skip the lines; you still have to line up at the ticket booth to exchange your voucher for a ticket but at least its already paid for The sunlight at 2PM made it hard to take pictures as the glare didnt agree with my camera Perhaps try going in the morning or aroundafter sunset
908,4,This is one of the perfect way to fall in love more to Seoul You can enjoy the city view in daylight and nighttime and in every season You better bring your cameras and your walking shoes if you want to climb the slopes but the easiest way to go up is using the cable car You can do a lot of things in N Seoul Tower and there are restaurants and cafes too
909,5,I say great view of Seoul IF the weather or smog is clear Otherwise it will be like going up into any observation tower and seeing next to nothing With clear weather you can see Seoul better than any place else Lots of food places at the base If you have a significant other bring a padlock write your lovebirds name on it and fasten it with the millions of other adorning the fences around the base area of N Seoul Tower You can take a moderate hike up from multiple directions take a tram ride from Namdaemum area or catch some public transportation or tour Dominant landmark visible from all over the city for getting your bearing Interesting place to visit
910,1,We were here nearing sunset The view of Seoul from Namsan Park was great but not the view from the observatory deck which cost 10k won We felt that the glass was stained and could not provide a clear view Especially at night the glass was reflected by the bright light from inside the deck Ended up we could not see much of the view and have to constantly get ourselves as near as to the glass and kept wiping the condensed glass We also felt that the deck was more like a souvenir shop as it was very packed and the walkway was narrow  Other than that the line was long too So there were waiting lining waiting and lining Pretty standard for touristy spot  Would recommend to just view the skyline at Namsan Park instead The sunset was good too
911,5,We were lucky to get dropped off at N Tower by AJay of Ultimate Korea Tour and then he picked us up after we took the cable car ride down The top of N Tower has great views and of course fun to leave a heart on the fence of Love Locks You can buy a heart lock at the stores up there then write on your lock the date and your name and where you are from then lock it onto the fence Its also fun to get your picture taken in front of a green screen then choose the background pic You can also buy a postcard that includes a stamp and mail it from N Tower  very convenient
912,4,I have visited this place several times I recommend walking up the trail The views are great and its an excellent place to take pictures I think it was prettier without the mall built around it Its a good place to come with kids
913,4,The Tower could be reached both by cable car and on feet The view is very from the tower Couples often place a love locker there
914,5,We went at night which was a different view of the city All of the lights are beautiful and the gondola to the tower is really pretty views
915,4,To avoid the steep uphill walk from Myeongdong Station and the crowds for the cable car we went up using Bus 2 at Chungmuro Station Exit 2 We had timed our bus to reach N Seoul Tower at sunset Near the top we saw a lookout with beautiful views of the sunset but there was no bus stop and our bus passed the lookout Well never mind there ought to be better views at N Seoul Tower itself  Wrong The sunset at N Seoul Tower open platforms were either blocked by trees or were facing the wrong direction Up in the observatory it was not easy to take good photos with the glare from the glass  The Sky Restroom was a cute novelty though  We also liked the new Ssentoy Museum Not a very big exhibit but still good entertainment for an hour or so  We took the cable car down no queue and the Namsan Orumi to Myeondong Station downhill all the way
916,5,This spot is just great You can get a great view of the city and the tower it self has some really interesting things to see and do
917,5,Enjoyable and easy climb up Namsan Mountain to Seoul Tower with a wonderful panoramic view of Seoul
918,5,If you want an amazing view without having to climb a mountain this is the spot for you The view was do good we went back twice during our stay  Theres loads of food options noodles burgers cultets chicken and beer 2 buffets and a French restaurant on the top floor  Theres also a pretty good arcade and there are martial arts displays on sometimes the cable car makes it so easy to access but the walk up through the park is lovely too Not to be missed
919,5,I would suggest walk up instead of taking cable cars The mountain isnt high you should be able to get there within half an hour You can spend a couple of hours to circle around the whole mountain track The view on the tower is just magnificent suggest buying a cup of coffee in the artrium and sitting there for relaxation
920,5,One of the must visit place when youre in Seoul Can get a nice view of the city and you can leave your signature lock here 
921,4,It is a nice place to spend the 2nd half of the day There are restaurants coffee shops souvenir shops and lots of lookout points for photo taking The sunset is amazing from the top and the night view is not too bad either The sky toilet is an absolute must visit just for the fun of it It is very couplecentric on the top with various love locks locations lovedovey photo spots targeting tourists and Seoulites going on dates
922,4,Note that a entrance fee is charged to go to the top of the tower  about 10k  The walk to the tower is rather enjoyable and is a short intense hike from the entrance of the park  The tower itself is very commercial  but what made it interesting for me is the 250 view from the top of the tower As a European it takes this view to grasp the extend of the large expanse that represents Seoul; dense habitations shops and highrises as far as the eye can see  Taking pictures here may not be very fruitful since youre behind glass but youre in the open if you go down to the 4th floor
923,4,There are few ways going to the top The most accessible to tourist either cable car which you have to pay or walking During november the autumn foliage is beautiful at the top you can appreciate seoul city both during day and night trip if the weather permits the sunset is beautiful
924,4,Great place for travelers kkk and weather was cool and really good place for couples i think kk if ure traveler hace to go there but evening is more beautiful and have fun
925,5,It worth to wait in a line to attend the tower and enjoy sightseeing great atmosphere and technoligies An elevator will lift you to the top in 30 seconds to observe spectacular Seouls life All WCs are with a window wall and you may enjoy the view even there Souvenir shop and Hello Kitties museum provide a variety of gifts for adults and kids
926,4,Skip the bus and enjoy the hike up to the park at the base of the tower Have a beer in the rotating restaurant but dont eat there and enjoy the panoramic view of the city Go on one of the rare clear days or you wont have much of a view
927,2,This is my first time in Seoul korea and decided to visit N Tower on a Saturday the line was very long and it took us almost 2 Hours just to get the ticket and ride the cable to go up the tower Once we got to the tower it was very crowded and we have to wait on the line again just go go down the lift The view on the observatory is not very impressive and its not worth waiting for 2 hours
928,5,Seoul tower is a must see attraction in Seoul It is true that you have to climb a hill to get there but on the top your efford is paid off with amazing view of the city It is also appropriate for people in love because there is a fence where they can lock their love with a lock forever
929,3,My wife and I were visiting Seoul for five days and towards the end of our stay we were largely out of sightseeing destinations Almost as an afterthought we decided to see the view at night from N Tower I genuinely wish we hadnt made that decision The process takes a long time as it is crowded getting up the cable car and then up the elevator Then the view from the top is at least at night largely obscured by the bright lights of the gift shop displays which are DIRECTLY behind all the windows So youre essentially seeing glare not the beautiful city lights Big tourist trap too  lots of kitschy souvenirs and overpriced food To say nothing of the love lock gimmick they have going on too And the N Tower itself is hardly impressive if youre been to other towers around the world  Pass on this one
930,5,Ive been here doing the day light and during the night Its such a pretty place And they have a great view of the city Try to go during sunset so that you get both the day and the night view of the Tower and the city
931,3,I was originally going to take the cable car up to see Seoul Tower because I like cable cars However it is inconvenient to get the the cable car eventhough there is a free shuttle I read that in the afternoon the line can be quite long Then once you get to the top there are alot of steps to get up to the tower I opted to take the bus up instead I didnt go up to the observation deck but you can get a decent view from below as well LG has three OLED curved displays One is a wave the other is a tunnel and the third is a circle There is also a 3D immersive video display as well which is kind of cool I waited as long as I could but I had to leave at 6pm Unfortunately the tower was not fully lit up yet They seem to light it parts of it one at a time very slowly for some reason I had to head back to get my bags from my hotel and head to the airport
932,5,I was only in Seoul for a couple days but this was my one of my favorite things to do Be sure to leave plenty of time to enjoy the experience We left our hotel about a mile from the tower at 2pm walking and returned at about 6pm The time is spent waiting in lines to get up the cable car and the tower About an hour wait for the cable car and 30 min for the tower The observation Deck is worth the extra money I really did not understand how big this city really is until I was on the observation Deck As far as the eye can see in every direction the city sprawls out over the landscape It is so beautiful and amazing Truly is a humbling and awe inspiring sight Was worth the wait and worth the experience My guess is that it is less busy in the morning
933,3,You get to see a paradomic view of Seoul city at the observatory View was not spectacular and there wasnt much to do at the tower too
934,4,A was a nice and sunny day albeit a wee bit hazy Went all the way to the top and nice views of Seoul 11 million people are living here Plenty of things to do and can spent half a day easily You can walk all the way up or even cycle but would be okay to go to top by car and walk down Plenty of lights to make evening visit worthwhile
935,5,The walk in Autumn is definitely worth it instead of getting the cable car  The base of the tower had traditional dancing and performances which is great to stop and watch whole you rest a little  The line for the tower was fairly long but the views are amazing from the top The most surprising thing was going to the toilet to discover the full window views definitely an experience in itself lol
936,4,There is nice large park around it with shops out side the tower Acceptable fees for entry and nice view of the city from up and great souvenirs shop at the end
937,4,Superrrrr place for sightseeing especially in the eveningWe visited in the evening and the lighting is superbNot to be missed since you can see the entire skyline of Seoul
938,4,N Seoul Tower is worth to visit 1st time been there by cable car 2nd time I went there last year during my honeymoon trip since the cable car is under maintenance we go up there by public bus Feel so happy go round around the city before we reach our destination I would say the scenery is beautiful from the top you can see the whole Seoul City In the cold weather its so relaxing The padlock is an attractionI cannot help it but to read the wordings on the padlockIts really funny you knowPeople write a lot of things to express their love affair Ha ha ha I really like to spend time up there
939,5,We couldnt take the cable car due to the long queue We decided to walk till the top and the stress was well paid back The view was amazing especially at night A must attraction if u spend somesome  days in seoul
940,4,I went there as a tour leader and brought all my guests there it was pretty cool when u come to Korea around april because the path to go to the N seoul tower got so many trees and some flowers are blooming look like a cherry blossom but seriously it wont be cool if u come in summer coz it will make u double sweating P
941,5,Nice place for tour in SEOUL Tower has different color depend on air conditions Green blue yellow redetc
942,3,I went with my family to show them the birdsview of Seoul Too bad cos it was difficult for them to walk up the steep slopes They should have allowed cars with passengers who are senior citizens to go up atleast near the elevators so they can enjoy the view as well
943,5,It was a great experience going up the N Tower this time in a car instead of the cable car It was certainly a different view As I recall 10 years ago the inside of the tower is slightly different to what it is today For example 10 years back there was no LED tunnel at the entrance The entrance is unique the tunnel is made of LED panel that plays 3 different videos It started with Seoul City universe or nebula and followed by marine lives All different video gives one different feeling as you walk through it My favorite so far is the marine life video
944,4,I went there on 21st September it was windy and cold I love the weather But it was foggy too the view is not clear we could not enjoy the view that much I like the souvenir shop and mini mart there the service received from staffs were so good
945,5,Tremendous views from the top Well worth a visit Exit Myeongdong station and walk to your left up a narrow winding hill for about half a km then up a flight of stairs to catch cable car which is 8500 won Takes just a few mins and the views are great After this you walk up more stairs and ticket office is to the right for the tower
946,5,123 floors Exiting Fast lifts Sky restaurant Good food and and a reasonable menu for a sky restaurant Well organized and good security Enjoyed  Photo facility excellent
947,4,I went to this site by cable car admission fee 8000\person round trip It open until 8am we left on 730am and cable car still operated You can just walk around the tower see the view and theres unique spot love chain everywhere Besides you can enter the tower and go up but it needs extra fee 10000\person In the tower you can see Seoul from the sky and you can see sunset Best spot to take the night scene light of the city is in outside the tower no window Its modern tourism you can get from Seoul
948,4,It seems that every major city around the world has a Tower Its always a beautiful view of the city from high grounds The majesty of Seoul could be only seen from Seoul Tower
949,4,This tower is very similar to tower attactions in most asian countries The tower gives you a great view there are gift shops and places to eat in the connecting building and laces to sit and relax if you need it One thing that is different is that there are lock and keys on most walls This place is a place of love Many couples come here to put a lock on the fence to symbolize their love
950,4,My wife and I got the return cable car ticket from a friend so we went to N tower The cable car journey up the hill was really picturesque We went up here towards sunset and the view was just amazing You could see all the trees and the setting sun while going up the cable car  Once up there we went to the place where there were the love locks It was pretty cool And makes for a nice photo stop You can place a lock there as well but youll have to pay a fee to purchase a lock I think We didnt do that But lots of people were doing that  We then continued to the tower The top was really great with cafes restaurants and souvenir shops there The highlight is the top of the tower where you could just stay and admire the city Really beautiful with all the city lights at night You could even buy snacks and popcorn there  On the way down the cable car broke down And everyone was queuing to get refunds They staff were good and helped to move things along as quickly as possible and we got a refund for not just the trip down but the whole return ticket price So it wasnt too bad  Id recommend it if its your first time there but if youre there during winter be sure to bring enough clothing It gets quite chilly up there because of the wind
951,3,Seoul Tower is an inexpensive attraction for families and couples Its a great place to relax and see some of the impressive Seoul skyline from the highest spot in the city You can take a cable car up to the top for under 10 or make the long hike up on your own I did not go to the observation tower It can be busy during the day so I would advise going in the morning hours or just after 3pm However it is one of those places I would only go once Once youve seen it and have taken all the photos from all the angles whats the point of going again
952,5,If you like to view from height I would recommend you this attraction You can go on to ramp with transparent floor and take your picture The views over the city are beautiful we did it in night and it was perfect
953,1,We paid the 8500 won each to take the cable car up to the base of the tower at night by the time we made it to the top it was pouring down with rain so it did kind of damper our excitement The love locks were nice to look at I wasnt keen on buying a heart shaped locket to write sweet nothings to my husband  You trek up the stairs more and buy a 10000won ticket each to go to the observation deck at the top of the tower I didnt and still dont understand the option to buy a popcorn bucket and coke combo with your ticket Que and get in the lift They tell you to look at the ceiling of the lift and you watch a retro 30 second clip of going up the tower and exploding off into out of space and land somewhere You step out the lift around the corner and stand in another que for a photo in front of a green screen to which you stand in line again to see your photo with 4 different sceneries with or without the tower in it You need to pay 12000won for a photo or more for a framed photo or 2  You can bypass it Congratulations your at the top of the tower Multiple signs of No Photos Allowed You can sit on some stepsplatforms they have You can buy some expensive souvenirs and pay by weight a self fill bag of selected candies  The sights are nice but I personally feel some of the parks around Seoul give you a nicer view without the money grab
954,5,My son and I loved this place It was fun riding the cable car and hanging around the Tower Park Lots of free performances and very romantic as well
955,5,If you want to see Seoul from above this a must Go in the week not weekend There wasnt any queues when we went
956,4,Like most attractions of this type the North Seoul Tower is what it is a tourist trap That doesnt mean its not worth seeing Just be aware that you are there primarily to generate revenue via group photo sales overpriced gift shops and restaurants etc Stick to enjoying the views and youll save a ton of Won   A word to the wise When heading back down to the bus stop make sure you take the correct path Otherwise like us you could end up unwittingly hiking down the full length of the WRONG side of the mountain  If that happens just buy a tramway tickets ride back up to the base of the Tower and try again Bet you wont make the same mistake twice
957,3,This was a beautiful view and it is in a lovely area We went at sunset on Tuesday and it was crazy busy We spent a lot of time in line and a lot of time walking up hills and up stairs There is an elevator to the observatory and we took the cable car up as well Still a lot of walking
958,4,Visited with friends the Tower of Seoul which is in the centre of the city You have a nice 360 degree view and a nice visit
959,5,We rode the cable car going to N Seoul Tower it was an amazing experience because of the stunning views of the city There are thousands of love locks that sorrounded the place The place with all the love locks N Seoul tower is one of the important landmarks of Seoul This iconic tower is a frequented tourist spot nowadays A must visit
960,4,Very easy to get to the tower The peak has some great views of the city Other than that not much else to do
961,5,This is the first place i go when i arrive in Seoul Beautiful at night Went up the tower nothing much up there only for the city night view Took the cable car to go up the hills as we are short of time Theres a free shuttle bus to get to the cable car entrance but you need to ask first as they on write shuttle bus on the bus and we got the bus by coincidence
962,4,We went up to N Seoul Tower by bus It was a rainy day and there were mist all over Seoul so we didnt go all the way up in the tower But the view was til great If we had more time in Seoul we would have went up there on a sunny day og clear night
963,5,N tower has a great night view when you go up by cable car the cable car kinda shaky at first but I think it is safe There are lot of attractions tooteddy bear museum and marvel museum  Please check on my vlog for more information EN CHANNEL search by title 4 TRAVEL BLOG DAY 3 JEJU  SEOUL  NAMSAN TOWER
964,4,Not a must see but this tower certainly has a great view of Seoul and is especially worth a visit close to sunset to see the many lights of the supercity Seoul come on It can get pretty crowded up the top
965,5,Going up here was memorable as we literally walked up the hill to get here My friend bought the package tickets with popcorn and drink and it was worth it The view of the city is stunning
966,5,Catch the bus near myeongdong station which goes all the way to the tower A bit of hilly walking is still required We did not pay to go inside since the attractions outside itself are enough There are number of floors to visit which are free Outside they allow free hanbok trial THere is also a show
967,3,When on in the tower windows were quite dirty so we didnt really get a good view The outdoor view was definitely much better There are many restaurants but my favourite was definitely the fried chicken restaurantreally good and spicy
968,5,This place was one of the top places that I wanted to visit during my stay in Seoul and it definitely wasnt a disappointment As an individual you have the option of taking the bus up the hill or making the hike but mind you its a pretty steep and LONG hike Once at the top there is a fee to go up the tower but seriously its only 10 dollars You should definitely do it I purchased a lock to put on the famous fence of locks because Im cheesy like that but if youre into that kind of stuff its great for couples Going to the top of the tower was amazing but I suggest doing it during the evening to get a few view of Seoul at night you wont be disappointed
969,4,Walked all the way up to the base of the tower through the park a gondola is also available but the walk was maybe 40 minutes and some good exercise Nice views from the top and decent elevator experience but the Lotte World tower is much better Though almost triple the price 27000 won compared to only 10000
970,5,amazing view fun interesting pleasant easy to reach pleasant walking around nice souvenir shops
971,5,This place is a must when you visit Seoul The tower can be seen from all over the city At night it is lit to beatification In the day its not as awe inspiring but still a sight for sore eyes Get to namsan park head towards the cable car and then youre half way up The park at the bottom of the tower is lovely so if you dont want to go up the tower the park has lots to offer too Three stages namsan park bottom of the tower where you can wander around and eat and choose from a range of restaurants and the final stage the top of the shop Make sure you head there on a clear day
972,4,We paid for dinner at Hancock which came with admission to the viewing deck We were there from 6 and stayed till 8 plus It allowed us to enjoy both day and night views The best view of sunset was from the toilet where there was full length glass window to offer wonderful view of Seoul  When we left at night the tower was beautifully lit and the windy weather made the walk down to the bus area such a joy
973,5,The N Seoul Tower is built very recently and gives a fantastic view of the city I visited the top of the tower at the sunset time and this it would be the best time to visit The transition of the daylight to night city lights is beautiful
974,3,Its just a normal observation tower passable Nothing really stands out compared to other towers in other big cities I noticed that there were quite number of shops at the observation deck selling souvenirs sweets popcorn etc The area at the bottom of the tower is actually more interesting There are love locks cafes unique shopping area and empty spaces for performances
975,2,It is a much better idea to hike to the top and look around the area and then take a bus down again Do not spend the money getting all the way to the top because there are other ways to see much better views here in Seoul
976,3,Went on the cable car ride up to Seoul tower station Cable car was squeezy full with no space to take a picture Wonder whats the capacity  Bought a combo for 2 which comes with a popcorn chose within 4 Flavours 2 soda drinks Proceed to the photo taking Station staff there were rushing through with the crowd Went up the lift to the observation deck Deck is reasonably space out with some folks lying on the resting area while waiting for nightfall for the night view  Staffs were talking within themselves and lol probably at their own jokes Staffs snacking away the candies Weeny Beeny  Well the view is beautiful probably the staff needs some motivation to make the tourist to have a more memorable moment Definitely a great view
977,5,You get 360 degree views it does get busy but worth it there are plenty of shops for eating and buying surveys they is a cable car that takes you to almost the Base of the tower or you can catch a cab
978,4,So I visit soul city the last week in May for six days My hotel had a direct view of the north Seoul tower or Namsan tower I really wanted to spend one day and go visit it so I waited for a Sunday evening thinking this would be a great opportunity and a quiet time I asked my hotel could I go to the tower by taxi and they say yes it would cost about 30 US I got into the taxi and pointed at the picture that I had on my cell phone of the North Seoul tower and he departed the hotel I did not know taxis and Individuals are not allowed to enter and drop you off at the north Seoul tower so he dropped me off at the cable car lift The line for people waiting was approximately one hour When I got up to the top of the lift I entered and bought my ticket for the tower observation deck There was a lot of people upstairs but it was a pretty foggy night so the view was not great Trying to get back down again you had the lineup for approximately 35 to 45 minutes to get the elevator back down again All in all it was a good experience but wouldve been a lot better if it wasnt so foggy I headed back to the cable car as I had bought a round trip ticket at 1045 pm because the cable car was closing at 11 PM The line to get into the cable car was approximately three times longer than the first time I got in coming up I knew I would be stuck in the line for at least two hours I ended up walking down the mountain in about 14 minutes I still recommend this experience but I suggest two things number one you go there and make sure its not a foggy day and number two dont use the cable car unless you dont mind waiting just use one of the city buses that are available to go up the side of the mountain to drop you off and return you back down afterwards
979,3,Nice to visit after getting the namsan cable ride Nice view fo the city but again nothing to compare to HK Peak view
980,1,Just a line Took my ticket around 730pm and asked if I would have to wait to go up  No Great lets go   Ended up waiting 1h to go up  The view is Ok you can see Seoul by night But Seoul aint nothing special to see from an observatory by night Moreover there are many light on the top floors which give reflect in many pictures Sky restroom are not skywalk restroom but just with big windows  And then to go down The queue started on the floor 5F when the elevator is on the 4F The complete 4F floor was just a line Never saw that   If you wanna go buy your ticket on the lower area where you can access the observatory You can at least see how is the line  But seeing the tower without getting in is enough and you also have the view
981,5,It is worth understanding that there are three stages up to the tower but it is all quite worthwhile on clear days when you can enjoy the views From pavement level and only a few minutes walk from the main shopping area it is a few steps up to the lower funicular station This is a free lift up to the lower cable car station The funicular is a single car that shuttles about a dozen people up an incline very smooth Stage two is a cable car that shuttles about two dozen people up to the top of the mountain There are two cars and there is a small charge and also very smooth The actual tower is the third stage but you do not need to go if you do not wish The cable car takes you to a small park area which seemed pleasantly cooler on a hot day Very nice to wander round view the city and take pictures I believe there are events up here sometimes Worthwhile way for visitors to use a couple of spare hours and get some fresh air
982,5,You can start your experience by taking the Namsan Cable Car to N Seoul Tower If not you can drive straight up to the tower I went there quite early shortly after they opened for operation The scenery is nice to behold depending on the weather Personally I feel that night time will be a better timing to visit
983,4,This place will give you a captivating sight at night You will see the beauty of Seoul The buildings and their lights are just like stars twinkling below and you will feel that you are in the space watching them
984,5,A lovely place to visit when in Korea We took Bus 5 there and walk up to the Tower It would be nice to visit the tower in the night when all the lights was up You can see beautiful scenery from the tower and the weather was great in May No regrets visiting the N Seoul Tower  Its a romantic place for couples to visit too  Highly recommended  
985,4,This is well worth a trip but there is quite a steep walk from the parking area The elevator that goes to the main viewing level is super fast and accompanied by a sound and light show on it ceilingThe 360 degree views from the tower show just how big Seoul is There was entertainment on a lower level on the day I was there
986,5,this is a wonderful place to go you can see the city from the top of hills eat and have fun I really recommend as a must do in seoul
987,4,You dont realize how large Seoul is until you take in the views Hopefully the day is clear  otherwise it could be disappointing You must be fit to walk the trek up to the tower but its worth taking in the city on the top of a mountain
988,4,This tower is on top of a mountain in Seoul It is accessed by an elevator and the line for the elevator gets longer as afternoon approachesThe view is spectacular from the top It is best to go in the morning  and on a day that the air quality is good
989,5,I took taxi from the hotel to the cable station book one way ticket if you would like to enjoy the walk down from the top The cable will take you up to the mountain I dont recommend at all the observation roof unless you just want to try I advice you to enjoy the views and explore the area You can walk down it is around 2k just follow the signs
990,5,Namsan tower is famous for lover locking their love by the tower However the place is suitable for everyone People also come with their family and friends I think its best to catch up sunset on top of the hill especially in spring You can snap lots of pictures Also you can get to see the whole lights of seoul  Best and cheapest way to go is to take bus from dongguk university station exit 1 The bus will directly take u to the bottom of the tower  Or you can try taking the cable car for more romantic feeling  Walking up the mountain by passing thru the park towards the tower can be a good exercise
991,3,Your basic tower experience a zoomy ride a full round view and snacks and souvenirs for those who want Since the tower is already on a hill it does get up there and you can se for miles The windows are kept clean for photos At the base there are some zero dollar view points and more kitsch We also rode the cable car to the base and added feature
992,4,The night view of Korea from the tower is amazing definitely worth the climb up Also there are quite a few activities at the top to do with dining options as well Very similar to Victorias Peak in Hong Kong Do check out the lovers lock bridge at the top for nice photo taking spots and the 3D LG screen experience that was really entertaining in bringing you into a 3D world with amazing graphics
993,3,I visited the Tower on 4 April evening I took the cable car thinking that it would take me right to the bottom of the Tower However after waiting for almost 20 minutes because of the long queue it took me to the car platform only I still had to take the staircase up to the ticket booth I did enjoy the sunset view from the observation deck but not too breathtaking Maybe its a good place for lovers but for me its just a landmark
994,5,The cable car cue was quite long for 530 in the evening nonetheless a quick process The views are breathtaking and a trip up to the observation deck is a must Appropriate for children and families as well as solo travelers The views at sunset are great
995,5,To help you get a perspective of this amazing city Views are breath taking We walked up to the tower through beautiful gardens then used the cable car down
996,4,This is a good walk or you can get the cablecar When you arrive at the top the view is incredible and a great vantage point A must when visiting Seoul
997,4,We visited NSeoul Tower aka Namsan tower at noon so it was a bit hot for us though it was early April The way led from bus stop to the tower was a bit steep but not difficult to walk The scene around the tower was beautiful as we could see most of Seoul inner city even the palaces It seemed to be a must see so there was a lot of tourists and especially the couples came to hang their love locks No need to buy the ticket to go to the observation deck unless youd like to do so just go to the T1 floor and a beautiful city of Seoul is in front of your eyes
998,5,It was so awesome to see all the locks and to go up into the tower It costs about 10000 won but its worth it I watched EXO showtime so i had to go up I also got the fried potato stick that Tao had haha And there is a cute gift shop at the top of the tower It is accessible by two ways You can ride the subway and then get off at a place where you can ride up the ski lift So you can ride the ski lift or hike up the hill My sister and I rode up the ski lift and then we hiked the trail down There are a lot of stairs It is a super fun place to play You can also get lots of exercises if you want We got water from the convenience store There was also a cafe there too
999,3,On the day we visited it was starting to cloud over so we only went to the base of the tower From at least four different areas you get a great view of the mountains and city So like other reviews save your 10 bucks Every day there are live shows at the base of the tower and they are Free
1000,4,Many people especially tourists there We took Bus No5 from Myeongdong subway there and we didnt need to take cable car There are many locks which makes the place so special especially for lovers and the view of Seoul from above is magnificent However the elderly may need some time and effort to walk up to the tower It was a Saturday There was a performance but I didnt watch it looks like they have regular performance at the square
1001,4,Not surprisingly this is a tourist trap Yes the view is fun and the hike up there do the hike is nice especially if you go during cherry blossom season However if you are able Id highly recommended heading over to Inwangsan Mtn instead if you want the same view for less money and crowds
1002,3,Make sure having fine weather before proceeding  Located on top of the hill and can see the whole of Seoul  Best is with Hot coffee in your hand while walking 360 degree absorbing the view of Seoul
1003,5,Try to come before the sunsets so you can witness the colors of the tower  We hiked all the way up it was difficult but the sunlit scenery was beautiful then took the cable car down  There are observation decks and another tourist spot at the top where they have the love locks similar to the one in Paris  As the highest if not one of the highest points in Seoul you see a great view of the skyline  Definitely worth the hike up you can take the cable car up too but youd miss out on the pathway going up tiring as it is the scenery was well worth it
1004,4,It was a really nice visit but the que is quite long Waited about 12 hr to take the elevator ascend dont know what its called We should have walked but wanted to experience it Another 1 hour wait for the gondola again wanted the experience If you dont care just take a bus to the tower or hike Another que for going up the tower about 20 min Very nice view up top The que to go down was about 45 min tho and no organization to the line so many people cutting in They had cultural programs going on at the base of the tower and we caught some of it Had chicken and beer at one of the restaurant there memmm just ok Took the bus down Our only bus ride in Seoul and it was crowded but fine Would have taken more buses but harder to figure out than the metro Cabs are pretty cheap too
1005,4,The day we visited was too foggy so were not able to see much It seems we should visit again on a sunny and clear day to enjoy the panoramic view of Seoul
1006,5,N Seoul Tower has the most amazing and exhilarating view of Seoul and there was so much to do around it
1007,1,Long lines upsells on pictures and other items Thereis no outdoor observation deck and the windows were filthy Photography from the top of the tower was pointless More long lines to get cable car back down If you want to go take a taxi to the base and just enjoy the outdoor views from there It will save you hours of frustration The only positive thing I can say is that the cable car and tower ticket werent expensive  I have no problem paying and waiting for a great experience but this wasnt even good
1008,4,Its my second time here My first time was over 20 years ago It is an awesome place offering great views of the city It was very crowded this time round with long lines snaking up the stairs leading to the cable car boarding station The boarding process could be done better and safer in my opinion like having a holding area with set number of people held in a room or something safer instead of having people stand in long lines along the Verona stairs which I consider as a potential safety hazard Overall a memorable experience and brought back seeet memories when I was younger then  Would have given 5 stars if not for the excrutiatinf long wait times snaking up various stairways Hope the boarding process will improve Another thing is when u buy food or snacks I was not able to find a trash can
1009,5,Hiked this area a few times during my visit Great exercise great views and a very cool area Totally enjoyed the whole area around the Tower
1010,4,This was a really great part of Seoul to check out You will get your exercise hiking to the top to check out the views There are some great deals for tickets at the main office popcorn  beers etc At the top you can see Seoul 360 as well as some craft beers foods and souvenir stores One of the highlights of my trip however once you get to the top we had issues trying to leave The line was constantly backed up and took 12 hours to actually get out of there It is open till 11pm so you can check out a sunset or the skyline all lit up A good stop to check out if you are in town rather inexpensive with good views  Bonus The color of the tower is suppose to coincide with the quality of air Green  good Yellow  not so healthy Red  Bad
1011,4,Theres not much to say take the cable car up unless you enjoy long walks up steep hills  Once you pay for your ticket and head up its like every other tower in the world it provides an excellent view of the surrounding city Enjoyable way to spend an hour
1012,5,This is a really must do the walk from Myeongdong is about ten minutes after that you get like an type of card elevator that takes you to the main area were you purchase ticket for the cable car You will then take it to the top you also habe the optiom to hike up Once you get to the top you can actually see the city and other beautiful things that the tower has to offer We did not when up to the tower itself because there was so much to see and do We had the best hot chocolate and they have churros Best time to go is night time
1013,5,Cable car ride was very nice with a great view The view from the top of the tower was great There are some places to have a drink and some food You will have to climb some stairs but there is an elevator for parts of the climb
1014,3,we go in winter season day view was beautiful with snow covered landscape but night view was just breathtaking to see millions colourful light up the city and that tower is just pretty to look up to especially in cold winter night
1015,5,Walking from Myeongdong subway about 1520 mins better to go during sunset and at night romantic view prepare time for waiting during peak hour about 60 mins but worth it
1016,5,I tried different way to get here Since I arrived very early in Seoul from Busan through a bullet train walked from Seoul Station to the Seoul Tower while walking i passed by locale jogging and exercising in the cold morning There I had the most steps recorded in my Samsung Health App 30980 The wind was cold while walking towards the destination I saw the whole City it was very beautiful That trees without leaves yet oh my God i really love it
1017,4,We decided to visit N New Seoul Tower on our first dayIt is located on the peak of Mt Namsan and is one of the most representative landmarks of Seoul There are three options on how to reach the base of the tower take the cable car hike it up for free or take the bus We chose the first option as it was the sure way we wouldnt miss the sunset from the observation deck In order to get to the cable car we took an inclined outdoor elevator from the entrance for free It took less than 2 minutes to reach the cable car station and 8500 Won was all for the roundtrip ticket It started to snow on our way up and it was a bumpy ride because of the strong wind but the view was too awesome to even care about it  We hopped off at the base of the tower and we were greeted by thousands of love padlocks which is frequented by the lovers for their ceremonial confession and proof of love SEOULromantic  MOVING ON  we finally entered the base of the tower and proceeded to N Photo Studio where a staff took us a picture and had it photoshopped with the tower in the background You may or may not buy it but Rachelle ordered one for us We then aimed for the elevator to take us to the observation deck Waiting to get in was another trip in itself as they projected a video as if youre about to launch into space Imagine what it was like when we stepped into the elevator Ive no words literally  See it for yourself Video to be uploaded  Reaching the observatory means taking in an excellent panoramic views of Seoul The sky wasnt very clear but the sights were still awesome at least for me Hehe I pictured Hyun Bin or Rain might be in one of those buildings Or possibly Daniel Henney shooting his film Furthermore it is also the highest post in the world where you can send postcards to your loved ones Climbing the N Seoul Tower was a great way to begin our Korea trip SEOULfun SEOULgood
1018,5,The Namsan mountain is very popular for its panoramic views nature park hightech facilities and cultural shows  TIPS TO ENJOY YOUR VISIT  1 To go up you can either ride a cable car or if youre in the mood for an intense workout walk up the pathway 2 Go in the afternoon and stay until early evening so you can get a view of the city both during the day and the night The view is so beautiful 2 Checkout the schedules of traditional performances Its spinetingling watching the shows especially if youre into Kdrama 3 Dont miss the padlocks of love attraction Its a nice area to take photos 4 End the night walking to the Myeongdong area one of Seouls main shopping and tourism district
1019,4,We decided to get the cable car upwaited 40 minutes in the queue 5 minutes later we were up the top  got some great views of Seoul city  We had a wander around the shops  had a coffee while we waited for the sun to go down We looked at all the love locks  all the couples taking selfies   It was a lovely way to spend a few hours We didnt go right up the top of the tower though as both of us are not great with heights like that  it cost extra  We did have a burger  chips there which wasnt great  a bit pricey so dont plan to eat there if you can help it  There was a massive queue to get the cable car down so we decided to walk So many steps But so glad we didnt decide to walk up I googled it  its about 639 steps We loved the walk down stopping when we felt like it  marveling at the people walking up  Definitely worth a visit
1020,3,Its a long uphill walk from myeongdong station to get to the cable car station We heard that theres an elevator oerumi going up the staion but we didnt find it Apparently its on the other street from where we are So from myeongdong station go to the road on the right of pacific hotel just go through that path ahead and when you see the CU store on your left turn right to get to the other side where the elevator is ahead of you Once youre on the cable car station buy your oneway or roundtrip ticket and the loading station is at the 3rd floor  Ride is very quick so even if theres a queu waiting time is not really long Once youre up youd be greeted by a great view of the city The rails and they even formed trees out of it are filled with love locks If youre with a love one its good to put a lock on it too to signify your unending love  they sell locks there for 5000 won to 15000 won couple locks You can also bring your own Budget tip  There are restaurants and other galleries on the plaza which you can also check out
1021,4,I went when it was raining and cold at night but there were still lot of people  There isnt much in the tower to see Shops and dining places are kind of lame But the Starbucks in there has windows and balcony witha good view  After getting there on a cable car i decided to walk down I walked pretty briskly and it took less than half an hour to get down to the cable station on the ground level Pretty dark when I descended in a rainy day and I was a little worried about safety but as I walked down I saw quite a few local couples taking a walk up  The pathway gives you pretty good view of the city And the trees along the path make the walk very refreshing Strongly recommended
1022,3,To be honest it is not worth going all the way to the top of the tower My boyfriend and I have been there and we wouldve rather stayed on the base of the tower and just ride the cable cars There is a small teddy bear museum tho
1023,5,I admit  Ive only come here once in my 4 trips to South Korea  however if youre just visitng for the first time  you cant NOT do it its a tourist trap but also a mustdo During the day you cant take the ride up the mountain via cable car and there are buses you can take back down
1024,5,Check the weather for your days in Seoul On the most beautiful day forecast make a day for Seoul Tower You can access it from multiple directions in Namsan Park You can hike up single track Trails or walk up concrete stairs and wood stairs You can even take a trolley if you spent too much time shopping  The restaurants are average but the views are amazing You can see all of Seoul from 360 degrees depending on where you are standing If you are a couple bring a lock you think you are with THE ONE ;
1025,5,Its super colder visiting here during winter time   But the queue is not too long just 1015 minute waiting
1026,4,This is a good spot to go to when you have done a lot of walking for the day  just want to slow down It has a great 360 degree view of Seoul including its skyscrapers  mountains  I took the Seoul City Tour Bus to N Seoul Tower which stopped just under the hill to the tower Once there you will purchase a ticket to the observation deck which is on Level 5  there will be a time slot allocated when you can go in  Upon existing you will see the love locks that are quite famous at this tower  take some more photos here
1027,4,Climbed the hill to the tower at night from the Cable car station as queue was very long Great views all the way up Took the lift to the observation deck on the tower 8000 won Note last entrance about 1030 at night Tower was crowded but good views over the city Make sure you visit the toilets for the good view Also you can send a postcard from the tower Caught the shuttle bus down
1028,5,view from up i can see part of seoullovelock are very colorful and its so beautifulsouvenirs are available too
1029,5,Went there one night in January so it was FREAKING COLD I think it would be better to visit in the morning
1030,4,If you would like to have a pleasant view of the metropolitan Seoul here is the place The top of the mountain gives you a good view around and on a good day you can see as far as Incheon port a neighboring sea port to the Yellow sea Top of the tower gives you an observation deck and above it a rotating restaurant The food or the price at the restaurant is nothing to boast about The whole place is usually overrun with Chinese tourists and tour buses therefore if you choose a exercising walk up the slope you might have to cope with the fume coming out of the buses
1031,5,Recommend going at night I have gone up a handful of times now and it is great Personally I have walked up each time while many people elect to catch a ride up Not a back walk from USAG Yongsan and quite enjoyable views The best views will be at night though We brought our daughter along and she loved it as well Stroller friendly and a great time If you have never been up before you need to go
1032,4,This again is one of those must see places in Seoul you must take an adventurous steep walk to get up but once your up the view is amazing Might be difficult for those having difficulty walking distances  One of the things I loved most was buying the locks with two keys and attaching it to the millions of others while keeping the key  Nice snacks ice cream and churos await you at the top and plenty of photo opps
1033,4,Before you go make sure the forecast says it is going to be a clear sunny day and the yellow dust forecast is low otherwise you wont have a good clear view of beautiful Seoul from up there I would also recommend you plan it so that you get up to the top of the tower before sunset its beautiful but are still there after sunset the lights of Seoul make for a totally different experience
1034,5,This is a great romantic spit to go to with your significant other The view in the fall is especially marvelous with all of the changing leaves just be sure to watch out for hordes of other tourists who will manhandle you out of the way for a snap shot There is a great Italian joint there and you can also leave a love lock if you can find a good enough spot This place is an iconic part of the Seoul skyline for a reason
1035,5,You will witness an awesome panoramic view of the whole city of Seoul The park is very nice which is perfect for sightseeing the love locks is a great picture perfect as well
1036,4,On foot or by cable car you can get to the tower In front of the tower on the hill is a large space for various events It shows the fight with swords in traditional costumes At the top of the tower where you can see the whole city going up fast elevator At the top you can enjoy the view and have a drink at the bar
1037,5,A must place to visit in Seoul Fascinated with so many locks Beautiful scenery also How I wish I can come back again
1038,5,N Seoul Tower is one of the places to visit when youre in Seoul  Walking from the parking to the tower is a little bit tiring since the road is uphill But if you get tired theres bleachers on your right side before going inside the tower itself  Inside there were cafes and souvenir shops On the top floor itself you see a great view of the city There were also padlock trees where you take photos  It was a busy day when we went but nonetheless you can still enjoy the view
1039,5,A lot of people almost impossible to get a pic without photobomb by other touristslocals  Recommended to go near sunset timing in this case you can get to see the day sets and the night fall in entire different view and feel
1040,4,It is a great place to visit particularly at night There are cable cars to go up to the tower but the queue were unbelievably long on Christmas Eve We ended up walking up and not using the cable car It is quite easy to walk as there are other tourist doing that too There are several viewing platforms along the way and some benches to sit down and take a rest There are amusement parks and eating places once you reach the top I must say it is extremely busy and we couldnt even get a place to eat Perhaps going off peak or not major festive season might be less crowded
1041,4,Romantic place to be if youre a couple A gondola ride up to almost the peak would be a fast way to reach the top Remember to bring a colourful padlock along too to lock up memories of your visit there Overall a lovely experience indeed to take a walk along the grounds there in nice cool weather and superb views once up the tower Also visited the Hello Kitty Museum at the base of N Seoul Tower and it was as pretty as can be Hello Kitty
1042,5,Well worth the time to visit Great views of Seoul Well worth the time to see the tremendous progress this city has made in the past 40 years  The sites are stunning with a good vibrancy surrounding it
1043,4,We took bus there so there was a bit of walking uphill steep road and it was snowing the night before so the road is quite slippery Nonetheless view was good I would recommend taking a bus there since it is way cheaper around 1500 won than the cable car 8500 won There are few mrts with N Seoul tower bus myeongdong Seoul Chungmuro stations
1044,4,The tower was great with fantastic views on the day I visited but for me I struggled to find how to get into the tower by foot Unbeknown to me on one side there is a cable car that takes you up there not widely advertised as most appeared to arrive by organised tours in coaches
1045,5,You will most likely ride the cable car from Namsan Park to get up to this structure which sits on top of a hill On a clear day you can get a good panoramic view of Seoul There are also metal rail walls at the base of the tower where many people leave their mark in the form of padlocks being locked into the railings copied from certain bridges in France Just be aware that they will remove these walls every few years due to the sheer weight of the locks becoming a potential safety hazard of falling over onto someone 
1046,5,Just like any other towers in other countries eg Japan You can only expect the majestic view of the city especially in the night and during Xmas season with all the glittering lights This Seoul Tower have to take cable car ride up to the foot of the tower or if not you have to walk around 15 to 2km up the steep hill to reach the foot of the tower
1047,4,it made the experience so much more fun But ohh boy was it a workout We even had to take a break halfway Make sure to hold the side railing Id imagine the trip back down would be unpleasant if you slipped and fell Would be a faster way down though haha
1048,5,I visited this tower during a Sunday while on business trip You can take subway upto myeongdong and then walk towards the tower which is difficult to miss Just make sure you select the right exit when coming out of subway The hike up the tower is not very challenging but you are advised to take cable car if extremely unfit or need special care The ondeck visit is amazing with lovely 360 degree views of Seoul and tell you the distance for major cities in all directions I enjoyed my visit to the N Seoul Tower
1049,5,Compared with other towers in different countries its rather cheap to go to the highest level of N Seoul Tower and The shops on ground or top floor are also good places to pick up souvenirs The night view from the top floor is superb Its a wonderful experience to visit and good choice of sightseeing spots
1050,3,Its just a big tower to look at Seoul from above But it lacks a character and kind of soul that similar towers in other places have  Eiffel Ostankino Pearl Tower Taipei 101 CN of Toronto Sears Seattle Tower gave me a much more powerful experience Important hint dont go for a airtrain that brings you to the foundation of the tower  use the stairs Considering the long lines it is much faster
1051,5,Not going to lie If you intend to climb up prepare your softest shoe because more than 500 steps awaits you But the view is breathtaking 10 million people from the eyes of the Gods Interactive and interesting museums Scheduled traditional martial shows Its a wow The Tower also provides different beverages coffee and places to relax or have some romantic moments
1052,4,A great view awaits you at the top but accessibility is questionable as we could not find a way to the top without at least a couple of flights of stairs Uber was the best way to get to the cable car then it is a short ride to the top and several flights of stairs to the tower Good activity for a clear day or night
1053,5,I love this place It is extremely easy to get here by public transport Breathtaking view of Seoul city n a sunny day
1054,3,For those that wouldnt pay for the charges to head up to the observation deck of the tower just making your way up to the 5th floor of the facility should get you to the top of the hill and give you a decent view youd have to walk about to get views of all sides  However beware of huge crowds and queues during the peak hours I wouldnt recommend heading there with the elderly or young toddlers and itd be a real hassle  Nonetheless it is one of the touristy places in Seoul Visit if you have to
1055,5,Staying  the Millenium Hilton we watched the cable cars  the beautiful sunrises  sunsets that made the Seoul Tower look so much more amazing from the Ex lounge My husband  I decided to take the stairs all 649 steps The air was nice  cool we took our time  most of all enjoyed the sceneries view especially at the observation deck Walking down  the easy part  took sunset photos made more beautiful  dramatic taken through the trees  the Wall The views climbing up  going down was so worth it  not to forget mentioning the workout is great for our hearts
1056,5,We took the fairy going up and returning nice place to spend the sun set many attract toon up and you can hang the locks there to
1057,3,I come to namsan tower by bus and the bus is very crowdedthe queue is very long view of the sunset at Namsan tower is very beautiful
1058,4,This place is great at night Beautiful views over the city Highly recommend as part of the visit when in Seoul
1059,5,Location is convenient many routes can go up from busy shopping area Cable car is the fastest convenient but expensive about 8000won 2 ways Better buy 2 ways much cheaper than1 way Walk from Myeondong to take free escalator to the cable car station Or take bus many routes cheap as 1250won also can see beautiful trees when going up will also pass the walking trail
1060,4,I have gone N Seoul at Saturday night and i were surprised that many people waited for cable car at station to the Tower that took time so much However I standed on N Seoul with cool weather but I felt Seoul city is beautiful and big city when you saw at here If you came with couple it was romantic place
1061,4,My daughter N I planned to spend half of our day in Seoul Tower At the end we were there from day till night There were many pictures spot and cultural shows which we enjoyed tremendously please check the timing for the show You may consider bringing a lock along to lock up so lovely notes along the way If you had forgotten you may purchase one in a store nearby
1062,5,Love these experiences and try and do this each trip I take to cities that offer this The entire experience from going up and up to coming down and down was fun
1063,5,it is not high but worth going please go good view in night time dont get lost or loose you child if you do loose your child contact the police imminently or check with the people around but loosing your child is very rare
1064,3,Its a good place to have a night view of the city but the tower observatory level was crowded with people You could actually enjoy the city night view at Namsan Park if you dont want to pay entrance fee and spending much time to queue up for the observatory
1065,5,Kdrama fans will know this site well Walk up the mountain and see the locks placed by lovers which are apparently cleared out occasionally Walk up is advanced cardio but there are stopping points along the way There are also bus trips that go most of the way up the mountain Shops and eateries are at the base of the tower
1066,3,If you are looking for a great view at night I would not recommend the Namsam tower The experience of the cable car ok but not worth paying extra to go up there for a view that could be better So dont waste your money at the N tower I recommend going to the Eungbong Mountain It was more of an adventure going up and its completely FREE for a better view I have posted two photos to compare the view from the N tower and Eungbong Mountain
1067,4,Nam San Seoul Tower is a must to see while youre in Seoul You can use cable car and hiking to go there If you not a hiking person its best to use cable car and they will offer cheaper price for return ticket What i really love is the view from above you can look mostly all Seoul city and if youre a lover  couple dont forget to buy a padlock and lock in the padlock area where you can put your wish together There is some trees which different color and looks like autumn color even though its summer season weird but really good to see the color
1068,4,very good maintenance system there is two times entrance fee for the cable car to the top that bring you to the high peak area and another entrance to the namsan tower
1069,3,when I say average I mean its the typical tower that many cities have with the city view and the souvenir shops but whats there really to complain about really if you want the view of the city and some snacks and a Keychain etc photo op etc go here
1070,5,Walking up the mountain and viewing the city from the tower waa a great experience  aim to get there by 5PM That way you can witness the view both in daylight abd2 then in night
1071,5,Namsan Tower is the must see attraction of Seoul I personally did not go up into the tower itself because there was a waiting period of 2 hours and it was already quite late when I got there But the view from the deck was beautiful enough for me The sight of the tower itself and the view of the city of Seoul really made my heart skip a beat I understand why a lot of couples go there There are several buses going to Namsan I myself took bus 3 from Itaewon Ps It is sort of a tradition to buy a lock write on it and hang it up on the fence on the deck I just brought it back home with me as a souvenir lol
1072,5,Towers can often be kitchy and there is kitch here But its set in a wonderful park with lots of people out for exercise and the views are amazing Seoul is a big city and one really gets a good idea of how big the city is how everything is connected where the river goes and the many little mountains in town
1073,5,You can take a long paved route 4060min shorter stairs 20 minutes or pay 8 for a cable car to the top The stairs arent bad at all We did it with 4 young kids 9741 The views are wonderful even if you dont pay Togo to the top of the tower The locks of love are really cool and there are great spots to get snacks dinner hot chocolateetc we hike up before dusk and watched the sunset and it was stunning
1074,4,We got off at the Myeongdong metro station and walked up to the cable car station which was a 5min walk At the cable car station there was a huge wait approx 15hours so we decided to hike up which ended up taking mere 40 minutes in a very slow pace It was a very nice hike with few viewpoints to take pictures and enjoy the view When we arrived at the socket there was a bad surprise waiting for us 25hrs wait But this was only for people not holding a museum ticket So we bought a museum ticker had to walk through the museum and then got up within 35min AndWOW The view is breathtaking and was well worth the wait Be careful about which ticket you buy and try to go a day with little fogpollution I also recommend dawnsunset and night time
1075,4,The N Seoul Tower is great for all ages has great views of Seoul City You can take the cable car ride up to N Seoul Tower from Myeongdong Station look out for the Namsan Cable Car direction take the elevator up if you do not wish to climb up a steep slope up to the cable car entrance
1076,5,We accessed this area from the Myeondong region using the cable car Nice lighted walks and view points scattered around The view from the tower is expansive and well worth seeing Go on a calm clear night Recommended
1077,3,Has good view of the city but bit over crowded There is bus transport near the spot and then a 10 minutes uphill walk to the top
1078,1,Access only by public transport  bus or by telepheric To visit around sunset and following a rainy day as to have a view as far as Incheon airport The access to the tower is free when you dine at the top Reservations are necessary It is a revolving restaurant and it takes about one hour
1079,4,its a great way to see Seoul from above  We go this tower around 730 pm so you can see the sunset and night view of Seoul the sunset is around 8 pm  The view is beautifull though its quite difficult to take a picture with glass around you  Dont forget to take a pee in the toilet if youre men because you can also see the great view while you pee D  And please bring a lock with you so you can express your feeling by putting that lock at the botom of tower  And last dont forget to take a picture at the edge of the clliff in in the bottom of the tower The photo is more beautiful  Instagram  adjimantoro
1080,5,You should visit N Tower if you want to look at the view of seoul Its the landmark of seoul The entrance fee is 9000 KRW the observatory is opened from 1000 to 2300 pm You can take on the namsan circle buses  2 or 3 or 5 or namsan cable car
1081,4,It is a great experience to visit the N Seoul Tower at night One could see the city from the tower and there is a light show on the tower body It is important to do some research on the transport before going there My first unplanned visit was quite troublesome It was at night and I took a taxi from the city The driver dropped me off and told me that was it It was a dark road and there was not a single person around Neither could I see any tower Luckily I found a young couple later on and was told that I had to take a shuttle bus to go up the hill After the trouble it was an enjoyable experience Please also bear in mind that most taxi drivers do not understand English and would not bother to look at your map I ended up drawing a tower Now one could install Google Translate on the mobile phone to help moving around in a place like Seoul
1082,5,Getting to the place wasnt as simple as taking a bus directly there it is a cable car right up and if you are afraid of heights this is definitely a ride of your life the view was amazing during the time i visit you get a glimpse of what you will be experiencing as you ascend when you reach the top give yourself at least halfday and preferably catch the sunset while you are up there dont forget to bring locks for couples and of course there are lots of photo opportunities with the teddies at the teddy bear museum
1083,3,As we realize that most big cities have their own tower this applies with Seoul as well Namsan Seoul Tower is located at Namsan Hills where we can see part of Seoul city for the above  If you happen to have more time in Seoul please have a chance to visit here Nothing much to see unless the view of the city if you are lucky you can have crystal view from the top of the tower but probably you can have haze sometime
1084,1,I came by when it was a China long holiday period This visit became a total Nightmare Queue 30 minutes to get onto the bus to get to the tower Missed the first bus as it was packed full  After which obtaining my ticket at 8pm i had to wait another 44 minutes just to go up the tower the time written on my ticket was the time set for me to get up to the tower So I just sat around waiting  After given entry had to wait and qued another 20 minutes to get into the lift  Finally got to the top only to find the observation deck packed with people  Its hard to take selfies due to the reflections from lights on the observation deck  The whole mood was ruined Me and my wife just wanted to leave after less than 5 minutes of reaching the deck  Getting back down from the tower again was another nightmare Queued for another 30minutes just to get on the elevator  Any activities was stopped due to the packed crowd  After which queued another 30minutes just to get on the bus back to the city  Despite all of that I still saw droves of tour busses full of China tourists pouring in as we left If u ever plan to visit South Korea please make sure it does not coincide with a China holiday  Total time spent on observation deck 5 minutes not including waiting for lift to get back down Time spent waiting 3 hours  Summary DO NOT VISIT WHEN ITS A CHINA HOLIDAY
1085,4,Nice place to visityou get to see Seoul from the top I recommend visiting However when we came down that the taxi drivers asked for higher fare than normal which was unusual in Seoul
1086,5,The N Seoul tower gives you the city view of Seoul I saw the famous love locks which i only saw on google It has restaurants and souvenir shops The night view was awesome since the tower was lighted
1087,3,If youre planning to watch the sunset go early Youll have to queue for the lift up to the cable car queue to buy the cable car tickets queue for the cable carand then climb up to the Tower It took us at least 15 hours just to reach the viewing decks  Its possible to bypass the cable car and drivewalk all the way up but Im not sure how long that will take
1088,4,This is an excellent experience but the lines are long lines were too much for me to cope Seems to be that an excellent experience attracts too many people so I cannot blame them
1089,3,My husband and I visited the N Seoul tower on a weekday at around 7pm We waited about half an hour for the cable car We were packed in like sardines Dont expect much from this ride except transportation only We bought the round ticket I would recommend only getting a one way ticket Its quite an easy walk down It takes about 1530 mins There are lots of photo points along the way which the cable car does not offer Also the wait for the way down was at least 30 mins It was chaos We did go up the tower in the elevator I have to say this part was a waste of money The views from the first level were amazing Going up the tower doesnt enhance the view that much Also it was mayhem in the observation deck You barely could make it to a window spot and the glass was covered in handprints and smudges Dont be fooled The wait for the elevator up was only 15 mins Coming down was over an hour Overall tho I would recommend at least going up the cable car But thats as far as I would go
1090,5,I went there with a best friend and we arrived at 10 AM the weather was perfect during September not much people in that time so you can enjoy the 360 degree site seeing from the top Also the restaurant on the top provides a very delicious food with many types of Kimchi I totally recommended for visitors to go and enjoy the magical view especially from the cable car on the way to the tower
1091,4,Seems to be the proudest tourist attraction do not forget to use the cable cars to reach the tower otherwise you could maybe not arrive ;
1092,3,let me start by saying no matter what this is a must when you visit Seoul when we first get there the line for the cable car was so long it extended well out into the sidewalk we opted for the hike instead its not easy once you get there theres another long line to get your tickets to go up once you get your ticket the wait is about 2 hours for your group to be called pay attention to group numbers because the lady told me it would be a 2hr 45min wait after they call your group its another long line for the elevator to get up there once you get up there theres a ton of people crowding the glass areas even eating in front of it its also very noisy souvenir shops also take up most of the floor space so ppl dont really have much elbow room once youre done with taking pictures yup theres another long line to get back down at this point you can tell everyone is cranky and tired its not all bad tho views were pretty good and there there are plenty of things to do while you wait for your group to be called make sure to wear comfortable sneakers because this will be a rough one
1093,4,Recommend taking the cable car to the top The walk isnt worth itI mean it great views kind of expensive but the restaurant at the top was very delicious
1094,4,I visited Seoul Tower ten days ago it was the last attraction in Seoul I did not visit But It was a little disappointing If you want to see Seoul to experience it to comprehend its greatness and beauty it is better to visit Building 63 places of Han riverside You will see the turns of river parts of this huge and beautiful town you will really comprehend it easier than visiting Seoul tower
1095,3,The feeling being up there is great as the air is clean and refreshing The views are beautiful too On the downside I feel that it is overcrowded and very noisy with many tour groups and visitors There was an event there on my day of visit which further worsen the situation The charm of the place somehow is discounted due to this reason Not sure for couples looking for a quiet and romantic time Maybe along the way up as it is less travelled Perhaps the management have to think of a way to control the influx for sustainability Please keep it well as it is a great attraction
1096,4,Seoul is described as the coolest city of Asia and it is it is a perfect mix of old and new and the tower is a perfect example of the new present in the city It is really high and I higly reccomend to visit the tower during the sunset it is really amazing to see the city from another point of view and maybe only from that view you realize how big and wonderful Seoul is
1097,3,Good place when the weather is fine but you dont actually need to enter the tower The views are similarly good from the top of the hill However the highlight was the view from the mens urinals Best toilet break ever Food is pricy also so stay away You can be a tourist and get a padlock with your love to keep there for ever
1098,5,The hike up to the cable car itself was quite a journey so wear comfortable shoes if you come We went on a weekend so we spent an hour queuing for the cable car so my advise is to come on a weekday when it is less crowded It is definitely worth coming during sunset nighttime to witness the glorious views of Seoul  Also a famous place for couples There are couples everywhere so if youre alone and is bothered by pda this is not be a place for you Then again couples are everywhere in Seoul
1099,5,Easy to reach and worth to visit I visited by bus from Myeondong area and choose to walk to reach the peak of Namsan I visited Ntower at night and it still wonderful to enjoy the scenery of the town
1100,3,First of all dont go to the N tower if it is cloudy or the pollution dominates Seoul During my stay I was very unlucky as I did not see the sun during 5 days the air was something between very misty and polluted Indeed the view from the N tower was quite disappointing On the other way it was nice climbing up to the N Tower basement starting the walk from Namsangol Park
1101,3,We hiked through the woods in surrounding park up to the tower entrance I would call it an easy to moderate hike The tower itself was crowded but the city views were outstanding
1102,3,We got to the bottom of the tower and they told us to go back down on the street and wait for the bus waited for 30 mins and its packed have to squeeze in  Got on top beautiful place you can see the whole city of seoul night time is better Overall its just ok nothing really much to do
1103,5,You can see north part and south part of South Korea from this tower They have some performance when we was there Kids enjoyed so much The love lock are arranged nicely
1104,4,Nice view Located on a hill with woody area around Does not have a sense of history or feel monumental Felt industrial and built to a purpose Could be perceived as boring unless youre into selfies
1105,4,A touristy must in Seoul Go up during sundown and catch the city in lights The love locks area under the tower is highly popular and perhaps a must do if you are visiting with your love Evenings are a little crowded but the best time to visit
1106,4,My last visit to Seoul was nearly 26 yrs ago Back then we had to climb stairs to the Lobby area of the tower Now there is a lift that takes you from the base of the hill to the lobby area We caught the cable car up to the tower and the view was breathtaking Too bad it was a smoggy day but we could still see the city There were little shops and a restaurant at the base of the tower On the first level there was a locks of love fence It was as impressive as the one in Italy Locks of all colors and shapes with names dates and messages lined the fences On certain days there are cultural performances on the second level weather permitting
1107,5,Amazing even the way to the tower is very nice full greenish  going gradually to high you can spend the whole day there                 Go up with very advance left just they will ask you to look top of the left for the panorama  you will find yourself on the top
1108,5,My first i walked up from the market today i took the tram with 8yr old son That saved the trip he enjoyed it immensely When hes older i hope to walk up  Visit the park just northwest cornet of the tower within the psrk limits  Great little restauarant you follow the pathway by the 1392 wall down to the corner cross the walkway its right there Across from the street from the hotel
1109,3,We went there on a Saturday night The place was very crowded So it was very difficult to take photos and really admire the scenary We abort the plan to go up the tower as we were told that the waiting time is at least 45 min
1110,5,You get amazing views of the city Worth the tram ride up and then the elevator up the tower In total spent about 25 CAD round trip using the tram to the tower up the tower and back down The park around the tower is nice as well
1111,3,N seoul tower is one of the must visit places in Seoul It is oneof the main attractions I have been their twice one on cable car which was crowded This time we caught the number 2 bus which was much cheaper There are shops and restaurants up there but you can see everything in about 1 to 2 hours Visit Seoul tower if you have never been
1112,5,This was one of the highlights of our tour The 360 degree view of the city was just amazing Be sure to go on a clear day to really enjoy
1113,3,You can go to the cable car place by car cab bus or by foot After you reach at the edge of the mountain you get to take cable car or climb up the mountain  Pros 1 You get to see Seoul in one site 2 though the cable car is expensive you can climb up the mountain to reach there 3 have cool performance in the afternoon  Cons 1 Ticket for observation deck is not worth the price If you wish to go i recommend you to get combo stuffs Pay some more and grab some snacks 2 When climbing from Myeongdong the slope is too high If your shoes are uncomfy just take cab or bus up there  Tips If you wish to go for observation deck i recommend you to look for tickets online Its nice when you go there at night or during sunset I wouldnt really recommend you to go up to the observation deck as there is nothing much to do up there There are weekly basis performances and benches just below the tower and it is good enough to have to sight when you are climbing up the mountain If youre not a local and love makeups it would be good to visit Myeongdong when visiting Seoul Tower Myeongdong is right below the mountain area walkable distance
1114,4,Crowds crowds and more crowds This place is really crowded with tourists and locals Seems like a very popular place with youngsters as they have love padlock trees and all around  The view of Seoul from here is good but maybe obscured a bit by foliage and geography Lots of hills between the tower and Seoul  Again with a guide the experience is better as he was able to explain the gates of Seoul and how the city was like in the past
1115,5,For sure every visitor should get up the N Tower The view is amazing day and night and is worth the wait and the supertouristic appeal I recommend walking up the Namsan
1116,4,This was worth the trip Fantastic view We tried the previous day in the afternoon but the queue was very long
1117,5,As in any city the high rise building or landmark towers give you an excellent view of the city and a better understanding of its size and N Seoul tower is no exception The atmosphere around the tower base is energetic and lively specifically around the love locks and there is nice cafeterias at the base and in the tower itself with souvenirs shop too I suggest you go in the early morning or at sunset where you can have a better view of the city and not abstracted by the high sun light specifically in summer months
1118,4,Went a day after it rained during late afternoon and the weather was quite foggy Hence we decided to only take the cable car up  down and not up the tower to save some money Theres plenty of things to see at the observatory deck itself as well To add on instead of going up the tower we decided to hang around the observatory deck to wait for the lights at night to come alive It was quite a pretty sight to take in  Also the place can be quite cold even during the summer as there were tons of strong frequent gusts of wind
1119,3,We took the cable car up the hill and found the fences of love padlocks and then went to the various ticket booths We had considered eating at the top of the tower but the various dining options were expensive and there didnt appear to be any menus to allow you to decide whether the prices were justified We obtained 2 lift tickets that also included drinks and popcorn From then on the experience was spoiled somewhat because it just seemed like a tacky cinema You do get some amazing views from the base of the tower and from the tower itself though the windows are filthy At the top there is a massive sweet shop and a small coffee bar There are few places to sit and it is crowded The mens urinal is definitely worth a visit  I think that a visit to the top should be on everybodys to do list but it was the only tourist attraction that we paid for in Seoul and yet it was the worst thing that we did
1120,3,Just soso If youve been to Taipei 101 observatory or others then dont bother coming Pretty small compared to 101  No malls or other places of attractions that are within walking distance  Maybe the more attractive part is the locks area where kdrama was filmed therejust for kpop fans
1121,4,I visited the tower recently and I would say it was worth it and I would do it again although not nearly as impressive as similar attractions for example one world trade center I think I decided to go there because it was my first time in Seoul and I am glad I did but I would not go there again I would recommend take the cable car to the base of the tower
1122,4,Overall Very nice attraction Offers a great view if the city like the tower in Seattle a MUST see when in the area  Value A good value attraction especially when compared to a similar attraction in the US  Area An oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Seoul You can also grab a bite to eat one of the restaurants on site
1123,5,This is a lovely place to see the city If taking the tram is within walking distance of the Myeongdong station The view is spectacular
1124,5,Very nice atmosphere Stores and restaurants are kind of pricey My family climbed the stairs and took the trolley down The trolley was over packed but appeared to be safe All in all it was great to see the city of Seoul from above at night time Crossed off the Bucket List
1125,5,Worth it to spend the time walking up the big hill to get to the tower and then take the elevator up Spectacular views Best before sunset then watch the sun go down from on top of Seoul
1126,4,A bit overpriced and crowdy If you have any difficulties walking a warning because last bit you have to walk uphills to get to this place if you dont take the sky lift We used bus to get there and skylift down recommend your o to the other way around or just skylift up and down Buses stop a bit away but well there it is really nice to see the entire city Worth the money
1127,4,Visted there with business partners nice view there can see nice sunset and they have area for lovers to place those love charm locks some even use phone case for writing more messages Can also dinner there is new so not very crowd Good Food but rmb no smoking there if really need a smoke pls do it before the cable car
1128,4,We visited the Seoul tower as one of the stops during a day tour of the city It was a good experience but the trek from the bus drop off point to the tower itself was one heck of a walk That incline was no joke The fee for the tower itself was inclusive in our tour so I dont really know how much it costs Once at the top of the tower you can use coin operated viewing binoculars to view the city surroundings There are also other photo ops in and around the tower are There are promise padlocks similar to the ones in Paris and other viewing decks for picture taking There are also gift shops and food concessionaires in the area
1129,4,I liked this place and atmosphere there are lots of padlocks of lovers We went there by cableway I guess its quite difficult go by foot but there is a nice park and a great view so if you have enough time and energy better go by foot because there is a big quite on the cableway and a lot of people in a cabin The tower didnt inmates on me because its not very high but view is nice and its an interesting idea with signs of cities and destinations to them on windows
1130,3,We were stupidly enough to try to climb up from Namsan to N Seoul Tower back in April but please take the cable car instead The experience was okay the tower itself was ok things were pricey in there The only thing that avoided me to have a good time was the crowd It was very crowded and I was there in April around 6pm to night  It was a nice view from up there though
1131,4,A nice place to see Seoul cityview and lock the love key for couples But i cant found special thing inside the tower It will better to reach the tower bu cablecar than by walk
1132,5,I went once with friends and once with my significant other Expect a lot of couples in the evening and enjoy the great view Try to go on a clear day The night and day view are both great
1133,5,We took the cable car going to the tower to save some time lol Really loved the place It was kinda crowded when we went there since it was on a Sunday Really loved the love locks too I must go back when I get a boyfriend one day lol Did not have the opportunity to go inside the tower and the teddy bear museum since my and my friend were on a tight budget
1134,4,We took the dinner package and had our afternoon meal at the North tower It is better to be here during the sunset as Seoul is quite smoggy during the day so it is hard to get the complete view of the city There are lines for both the tram going up and down and also for the elevator up in the tower so do exepect some waiting time The food is overpriced but remember that you are mostly paying for the view
1135,3,A tower with no elevator facility for disabled from the parking for them should not be operating until it offers the facility Service staff were not warm and their English skill was very poor Not a pleasant experience
1136,3,Its good to see Seoul from N Seoul Tower but its just like other towers in other countries You should expect 12 hours of queueing if you come here during peak season Make sure you dont come when its cloudy to get the best view
1137,4,The N Seoul Tower also known as the Namsan Tower or Seoul Tower is a communication and observation tower At 236m it marks the highest point in Seoul It was built in 1969 The tower is excellent for photography and provides a panoramic view the city The tower is divided into three main parts including the N Lobby N Plaza and the N Tower The N Plaza consists of two floors while the N Tower includes four floors Situated on the Roof Terrace N Plaza is a spacious wooden viewing deck and this is an area where courting couples snap Locks of Love onto the wire fencing There are literally thousands of padlocks attached to the fence and this is meant to symbolize the couples undying affection Once you get up there you can visit the Tower or just stay below and relax You can still get amazing views without going up the Tower
1138,5,This is my very first time visiting the N Seoul Tower It is a beautiful place for tourists and theres a new shopping area coming Although it is pretty crowded but still worth going It is easy to reach because you just have to take the subway and walk around 10 mins to get to Namshan Park Remember to take the cable car because the view is pretty dope Theres a love lock bridge that couples write their wishes on the lock then lock it on the bridge Good for them
1139,3,We took the free glass Namsan Oreumi elevator accommodates 20 people to the Namsan Mountain Cable Car Station to go from the base of Namsan Mountain to N Seoul Tower We went after a whole day shopping and were delighted to find lockers at the cable car ticket office The staff there was very helpful Cable car costed 8500 won per person return tickets and it took just a short while to wait for a cable car accommodates up to 48 people After the cable car ride and walking a short flight of stairs you will arrive at the roof terrace You can see padlocks and lovers everywhere  We also went up to the Observatory in the tower It was 10000 per person The night view of the city from the Observatory was pretty
1140,4,You park at the beginning of a walk from Hell up a VERY steep road to reach the Tower Take your time and the view from the top is lovely The night we visited there were a ridiculous number of people there and the platform you stand on to view the city lights has a few steps small going up which cant be seen in the dark Very dangerous and a trip hazard The fence is covered with love locks which should be removed on a regular basis as they will weaken the fence City lights
1141,3,Use cable car round tour for 8500 won Should be more beautiful during night viewnot really must can see and many peoples
1142,5,I love this attraction Whether you want to hike up there are many routes with stairs and real climbs or take the tram the view is amazing This is a perfect activity for visitors There are some touristy things like caricatures locking a love lock and taking selfies but there are also amazing views of the city The look outs help you see how big Seoul is and all the restaurants have great views There are a few shops and restaurants On some days and times there are cultural performances This is a must activity for tourists to Seoul
1143,5,Visit the N Seoul Tower at night for maximum impact It offers a beautiful view of the city lights Good food options also although I found that they close a bit early N Seoul Tower can easily be reached by exiting Myeongdong station and taking the Ormi or elevated lift to the base of the Namsan Cable Car At night queues for the cable car either going up or coming down can run long so budget time for that accordingly
1144,4,Its not the best tower in the world and perhaps not even in Seoul but it is still an attraction and I want to do it all in every city I visit Sitting atop the hill makes the tower ever so epic My in laws wouldnt go up out of fear Trust me its nothing to fear If you miss the trolley like we did and have to walk all the way then thats something to fear lol Honestly the locks Everyone loves the locks that adorn the gate symbolizing forever love It looks silly to me but to each his own
1145,4,Seoul Tower is a landmark visible from most parts of town that provides a great view especially on clear days Sherry and I were here on our 45th anniversary and fell for buying the Love Locks Remember dont bring the key back with you  bad luck The cable car to the top was fun and beat the long walk up to the Tower
1146,5,Worth everyminute Caught a cab up to the cable carbought a round trip ticketunfortunately we went on a sunday of a public holiday so it was busybut expected queuing time approx 40 minsworth every minute to see the viewwe then bought a ticket to go up to the observatoryi enjoyed it but not something you have to dothere is plenty of advantage points at the base of the observatory for picturesthey also have a man selling locks for couples to place around the areaseveral eating areas and a water spray area for the childreneasy acess for people with disabilities lifts and runwaysyou could also buy a one way ticket and walk down the path but be warned its a long way downthey do have another ticket outlet upstairs if you change your mindmy suggestion for a great overall view of Seoul
1147,5,To reach this tower there was 2 option by walk or u can take cable car we decided to walk and hike little bit in the afternoonit was long walk but it was really worth it great view from top we did not manage to go up to the tower we just enjoyed the view from the park and rest little after before we head down back to the city
1148,4,As first time visitors to Seoul we had to stop by the Seoul Tower The views from the park and the top of the tower were lovely but know that the tower is a major tourist trap Everything from the tram ride to Tower entrance and pictures cost money and the crowds get excessive so get there very early like we did
1149,5,Love the night view so much Suggest to visit it in the evening  but go there before 5pm as there is a long q and may take longer time to reach the tower to see the day and night view Remember bring a thick jacket if visit at night It is damn cold After the cable car you may reach the Namshan and here yon can have a drink to enjoy the view around
1150,3,N tower is the landmark of Seoul Was very crowded during spring and the air was still cold We walked uphill and a little bit tired Not very interesting many people just sat there and enjoyed the view Theres also famous love lock where couples locked their love So for couples who want to lock their love remember to bring your own lock
1151,5,No other way to see the city then to be above it Great views from up the tower Youll find yourself taking way to many photos which are all great
1152,4,This is the only way to see all of Seoul at once and appreciate the size and density of population The cable car provides an easy way of approaching if you dont feel like a 40 minute walk up the mountain Taxis understand NamSan Cable car Very nice to walk around base of tower before ascending You can sit back and enjoy the view and have beer and sausages if you want to just relax at the base of the tower Also you get to see the ancient signal fire station that provided Seouls early warning system more than a thousand years ago
1153,4,Namsan Tower offers a great view of the city We went there during the last week of the spring season so the weather was still a bit cold We took the cable car going up but we decided to hike going down due to the very long queue Our friend who is based in Korea said that the place is not usually packed but because we went during a holiday there were a lot of locals Nonetheless it was a great experience
1154,4,nice view of the city maybe a challenge to go up by stairs but will try next time at the tower feet you can bring your own lock ant stick it to the fence like the rest of the tourist thats the trend now you can take some nice shoots from the terrace
1155,5,Super easy to get there and back with incredible views Several options including hiking great trails up city bus or cable car Going up to the base of the tower is free going up to the top is around 10 or so Take the time to go you will not be disappointed
1156,4,My husband couldnt make the elevator trip to the top due to his fear of heights but I did it and it was fantastic We were lucky that the air was clear skies blue and the view went on forever Really great attraction
1157,4,You can take a taxi to the short cable car ride if the walk up a steep hill doesnt appeal The view over the city is impressive once up there Its optional to go up to the top of the actual tower we didnt This is a famous place inasmuch as people fasten padlocks and a selection of other items such as mobile phone covers to the railings and dispose of the key Many locks are inscribed with pledges of love Dont worry if you forget your padlock  you can buy one and borrow a pen from a seller at the tower There are literally hundreds of locks and they in themselves make for interesting photos
1158,5,The tower is quite an experience from the minute you enter the elevator The service is great and friendly On a hill at the centre of Seoul the tower offers commanding views of the city For shoppers there will be temptations galore as you walk through the couple of floors at the top The tower is also beautifully lit at night
1159,3,Love the view from there There are three option going up there by walk cable car or bus I take bust from Itaewon take me around 15 minutes Fee to going up to the tower is USD10 but only few people going up there They also got restaurant The view is superb
1160,4,Requires some amount of energy to cover the steep climb road to reach the entry Beautiful view of the seoul and the neighbouring countries with their distance is marked on the glass walls of the tower Suveneers are sold inside the tower with refreshments Nice to spend an hour
1161,4,Lovely place to visit but be prepared for long queues No clear directions for entering the restaurants or restrooms in the tower We had to go around in circles trying to find the enter acne to the restaurant we were booked in Best place to view the Cherry blossoms from
1162,4,N Seoul Tower is a must visit if its your first time in Seoul I do not enjoy the cable car ride up the Tower area though There was no seats and overcrowded with people View up the hill was great but a pity I couldnt capture much photos because of space constraint Once we were up the hill everything was good There were pretty spring flowers blossomed and the weather was good The view from the Towel was magnificent too overseeing the whole of Seoul
1163,5,The view from the tower at night is BEAUTIFUL Buy a one way ticket up by cable car then walk down There are many pretty spots along the walk down to take pictures The wait to take the cable car back down is very long anyway
1164,3,Nice place to see the sunset Buy the observation ticket to go up noting much but able to see Seoul from high up  I enjoyed buying the postcard and sending it back to my friends and myself the post card with stamps cost about 2200 won Please do tell the cashier you are gonna send overseas so she will give you another stamps  I dont know if this is the peak season When I was there its was madly filled with people Too crowded making the observation area hot and stuffy
1165,5,We ride the cable car and passed by the attraction place to tied you love pad lock Beautiful scenary from the top
1166,3,Ive been to the same tower in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia and I have to say Malaysias tower is bigger It was rather disappointing that I can complete one round of walking in just a few minutes However the view was excellent It was to see all of Seoul from above Sunset is a nice timing to go They have souvenirs shops in the observation deck itself You can also sit on some platforms in the observation deck to enjoy and absorb the view At the bottom of the tower itself has aa few cafes where you can sit and enjoy the view They have this place where you can lock your locks something like the bridge in london if im nit wrong Ypu can get up to the tower either by climbing the stairs though not recommended as the stars is steep and its tiring You can also get to the tower via the cable car but it is always crowded sith people from CHINA Alternatively you can get up by the bus It will alight you a few metres from the tower itself where you can walk up a steep slope to the tower itself Its recommended to go if you in Seoul
1167,5,The hike to the base of the tower provides the opportunity to digest breath taking views of the expanse of the Seoul city scapesit is so compelling Seoul Tower illuminates my inner soul just looking at this spectacular landmark It is a must see
1168,4,Was a bit worried of the long line since we have elderly parents with us but we were lucky that we are able to go up with the travel van And they just opened the lift to go up the deck So it was a breeze for us as we do not need to climb the stairs It was breathtaking sight of the amazing lighted city A definite must visit destination in Seoul
1169,4,Overlooking from above Seoul appeared so magnificent with all its sparkling lights Definitely a mustvisit destination in Seoul
1170,4,Beautiful views of the city especially by the night The entry to the tower costs about KRW 6000 Must try at least a oneway cable car ride to from the tower to the city
1171,3,i think its just for looking at the view and walking around the trees of locks climb up the slope and youll see alot of flowers great for photo taking
1172,4,We came here on a clear sunny day and the smog was less hazy than normal allowing for a crystal clear view of the Seoul metro area  Do not waste your money unless it is a clear day
1173,5,A nice few hours visit you can enjoy walking up instead of using cable car stairs are not that steep and not having many steps so can enjoy the views of Seoul more and through the tress   A place for couples to put love lock on   I love the chair designed for couple to get closer when taken photos havent had the chance to test when travel solo  
1174,5,Talk about as far as the eye can see The climb to the tower was ok as we took the lower route There is another route that goes a higher uphill which was steeper and thats what we walked down to our bus from There are a lot of things you can do at N Seoul Tower aside from going up to the observation deck There are open viewing decks where you can hang out with your family and friends you can explore the little shops and eat at the restaurants You can also bring a padlock and lock it to certain parts in the complex All in all a fun experience
1175,4,It is a landmark of Seoul and is very charming during night time A must visit place if you were in Seoul Walking distance 10mins from MyeongDong subway station
1176,5,Start your adventure with the cable car ride to the base of N Tower Experience the Entertainment on the stage below the tower take a pad lock for your loved one Youll see when you get up thereeveryone does it Take the ride in the super fast lift to the top of N Tower for AMAZING 360 degree views of the enormous city of Seoul Fab afternoon out
1177,4,Its quite an easy access to the tower you can take bus number 5 from Myeongdong station exit number 3 If you feel a bit more adventurous you can walk uphill from behind Pacific Hotel in Myeongdong too for 1520 minutes to board the cable car Its gonna be full of people but I think it will never be too crowded You can go to the top and look at Seoul prettiest at night and you can also get a love lock to put around the chosen area or just to look around Obviously theres gonna be A LOT of couples just a headsup ;
1178,5,Despite the weather that day 6 C we braved the cold just to see the view of Korea from up the tower We reached the top by cable car another option is to hike which they said will take 40min Lining up for the cable car took us about 1 hr though And it was March when we went there The view of Seouls skyline is beautiful I suggest you go there early at night 
1179,4,Namsan Tower is accessible two ways One is on a hilly road my taxi went this way and the other less slopping on foot discovered this on the way down and comes out opposite the Myeongdong Substation near Prince Hotel It would have been a nice night view but I went in the afternoon and still get to see the city below As I hop into the cable car I cant help but think of Lee Min Ho and Goo Hye Sun in Boys Over Flowers when they were trapped there overnight All the surrounding trees were rather bare and not much flowers in sight at this time perhaps later after the rain In the main square there is cultural performance at 300pm and I was lucky to catch it Very enjoyable Theres a small souvenir shop a couple of coffee outlets a hamburger place and a few eateries but they appear to be closed Many lovers and couples swear their dying love by clicking locks onto many of the railings just like at the Great Wall in Beijing I missed the revolving restaurant 
1180,5,N Seoul Tower ticket costs KRW 10Kpax while buying online via SeoulTravelPasscom costs KRW 7200pax only  Took bus 05 from Myeongdong MRT Stn to N Seoul Tower that cost KRW 12Kpax with TMoney card Need to walk a very steep road to N Seoul Tower Since the road is very steep it will be slippery when wet so I dont recommend going there during rainy season  Go to the ticketing section to exchange that voucher to a N Seoul Tower ticket It takes 25sec to reach the N Seoul Tower via lift as per staff Once inside you can take the skyview of Seoul There are shops that sells souvenirs while you are still in the tower itself Going to the GF take a stair going to the Love Locks where you can see people attaching locks  Took bus 03 from NSeoulTower to Namdaemun since it was the 1st bus that arrived that also goes near to our Seoul hotel
1181,4,Getting to the tower is not an easy peasy thing to do as if you do not take the cable car which i did not you have to walk up an enormously steep hill to get to the tower However once up there the views of the city are amazing Make sure to go on a clear day so you can really get a good view of Seoul Sunset is best Also take a lock with you so can can add it to the 1000s that are up there attached to every possible place
1182,3,So we took the Namsan Cable Car up to the N Seoul Tower The cable car ride was about 23 minutes Relatively fast We bought a one way ticket because we wanted to go to namsangol Hanok village afterwards The lady at the counter told us we could take a bus to the Hanok village If you plan to go to the observation deck of the n Seoul tower I wouldnt advise getting the combo A package All that is is admission plus a tub of popcorn and a soft drink think movie theatre size  The circle we made around the tower upstairs was a small round Not really worth the money but it is a touristy thing to do This was ok Not much different from going up to Taipei 101 or Skydeck 100 in Hong Kong or the tower in Macau
1183,4,Face it the reason for eating at N is the view And the views were spectacular We booked for 700 Because of the limited space we were not permitted to ascend to the restaurant until 700 But we were able to go to the observation deck it is included in the dinner price We saw the Seoul during light as we walked around the tower at dusk in the observation deck and finally at night in the restaurant when the City was all lit up We were fortunate to have had clear weather and the views were spectacular That brings me to the food It wasnt bad In fact it was very good The menu is price fixe with several options Our family all chose beef which was good The surprise of the meal was the parmesan soup  which did not sound appealing but was very good For dessert the cheese plate was standard fare But indulge in the homemade snicker bar It was really good The meal was not cheap but were buying the view The terrific meal was a wonderful bonus
1184,5,nice view and the trick eye museum was really so funny loved the experience and had really good timethe view is also nice
1185,4,Amazing views of Seoul On a clear day you can see much of he city and surrounding areas There are some nice cafes and restaurants at the bottom of the tower It is a fun family day to walk up the trail and then have a ice cream at Cold Stone Creamery
1186,5,The view from the top was really nice You will see various sights of seoul I love that you can put locks and eat here Really romantic place Just prepare a long line during weekends and night time since this the time that couples date I suggest also riding the cable car since its fun and affordable
1187,5,You can see this tower from almost anywhere in the city it always helped me navigate and kept me orientated It is beautiful at night and and the view is beyond compare
1188,3,The N Seoul Tower experience is similar to Tokyo Tower After paying for admission you take an elevator up to the observation deck on the tower The elevator ride up is about 30s and there is a pretty cool video on the ceiling of the elevator The views of Seoul are breath taking but fog can obscure your view There are many paid and unpaid photo opportunities Before you go up the elevator you are asked to take a picture in front of a green screen and when you get to the top you can see the various backgrounds your picture could be on and available for purchase There is a cafe and gift shop available and pay per use binoculars are also available  The hike up to the tower is not too steep but the ascent could be tiring There is a cable car available that takes you almost to the base of the tower but the cost is extra each way and the parking lot is in a different location If you decide not to walk up the hill to the tower you will need to drive around the hill to the cable car parking
1189,4,Was surprised that the bus only goes so far and you have to hike up the hill for quite some way so its good to be in shape The view is great and the gift shop has quite a few gifts for a good price
1190,4,N Seoul Tower the N stands for the new look of the tower is a pretty hot spot to go in Seoul and for an understandable reason you can look over the brightlylit city at night and it can be quite romantic A lot of couples buy locks and keys for 8000 won and write their names on them before locking them near the tower and throwing the key away or keeping it I enjoyed going up to see it but its a whopping 10000 won just to go a littttle bit higher than the gift shops The extra price wasnt really worth it in my eyes
1191,5,you can come here during the day but the night view was amazing you could hike more like a walk up there or more conveniently take the cable car couples could lock their love keys sold at the merchandise store around the gate at the tower great view during sunset too must visit if youre coming to seoul for the first time
1192,4,This hill provides a beautiful view of Seoul and is a must on any visit there You can either take a cable car up or you can walk We took the cable car and it was great On top of the hill is the tower as well as a few historical sites Allow some time at the top to enjoy the views and sites
1193,4,I would suggest for you to take the sideways elevator to go to the cable cars there are different packages for groups at the cable car From our first visit in 2014 its now more stroller friendly There are now ramps where you could push the strollers as well as an elevator to the cable car area We took the tour this time to the observation deck we got the package for 2 adults with a big popcorn and a big drink at 21000won and a 2 kids package at 17000 won  with popcorn and drink there was a nice elevator gimmick going up and down We also had our souviner photo 20000 won for 2 shots It was nice because we were there before sunset so we saw the city before it turn to beautiful lights
1194,5,We visited the N Seoul tower late on a winter evening and waited for the sun to set The view at sunset was amazing but the night lights were also beautiful you can see for miles and miles in all directions The cable car ride is smooth and there is plenty of space There are popcorn and drink deals and family tickets which make improve the value
1195,4,Visiting in the evening allows you to take amazing picture as the sun set you wouldnt see the sunset but the sky turn beautiful shades in the evening while also enjoying the city night scene at the same time  Easily accesible from Myeongdong station Exit 4 you can either turn into the small road and head towards the general direction of the towercable car station 20 min be warned of steep slopes or walk along the main road after coming out from Exit 4 and turn left on the first major 4way junction and continue straight along the main road 58 mins or so to reach the elevator to the cable car station  Additional tickets is required if you wish to go up to the observatory tower for a 360 view of the city but for me touring the site and the outdoor area is good enough for me to get a birds eye view of the city  Once done you can continue shopping at myeongdong where the shops open till late
1196,5,A must see on a clear day Theres also the equivalent of the Trick Eye Museum inside the lower part of the tower Lots of fun in there too
1197,5,Great view of Seoul from the top and not as expensive as some other observatories in Asia  The staff is very friendly and trying to help wherever they can  Definitely worth a visit
1198,4,Its worth going up to the tower during the evening as you get to see the bright city lights both from the open area and at the observation deck Its a good place to hang out and relax with family and friends The queue was a bit long during our visit so make sure to go there earlier if you can
1199,4,My second time visiting the tower They had recently open the N Tower Plaza which is a 4 storey mall located just below the tower  Very nice view of Seoul can be seen from specific spot here make a very nice photos too with the love locks as background 
1200,5,As Far as the eye can see in 360 degrees from the top of the tower is sky scrapers I have been to observation decks in Tokyo Chicago and Hong King and the view at N Seoul Tower ties the observation deck in Hong Kong as the best This view is highly recommended
1201,5,Because of a flight delay I had only 15 days in Seoul instead of a planned 3 days The tower is close to subway and was easy to get to Walked up to the cable car and made my way to the tower Paid approximately 30 US for admiration and lunch at one of the 2 restaurants at the tower Amazing 360 degrees views of Seoul Just a wonderful feeling to be there Highly recommended
1202,5,N Seoul Tower No 1 attraction in Seoul this is my second time visiting the N Seoul Tower I really like this area very nice view of entire city of Seoul There have many choices to go there by Bus taxi and cable car I have chosen the cable car buy a one way ticket  KWN 6000 after visit buy a bus ticket for return to hotel
1203,4,The tower offers a 360 panoramic view of Seoul The ride up in the lift is a buzz  a bit like going at warp in the Starship Enterprise The walk up to the tower however was a pretty tough climb One wouldnt want to have heart problems
1204,5,I highly recommend visiting the N Seoul Tower if nothing else You can see spectacular views of all of Seoul in one place Of course Id recommend bringing your own lock to the Tower in order to participate in the tradition but locks are sold at the gift shop fairly inexpensive Purchase at least a one way ticket on the cable cars to avoid the walk UP to the tower It is well worth it especially in the winter
1205,4,You can take bus No 23 and 5 from Myeongdong to Namsan Tower with reasonable bus fare In order to go up high you have to pay extra fee around KRW12000 to KRW20000 You can buy some padlocks to lock your love
1206,4,Took a 10 minute walk journey to the cable car station through the path on the right hand side of pacific hotel That route is quite dark and quiet in the night I would suggest if you are going up you may want to consider of taking a cabbus  The cable car to the N Tower is standing cabin not sure what is the max capacity but on my way down the staff tried to pack in as much people as they can felt like a sardine in the can  Regardless of the experience I have in the cable car the view up in the N Tower is beautiful and amazing  Last beware of touting taxi driver On our way back thought of taking cab back to our hotel at sines aDong we are been quoted 30k Won As such we decided to take a walk down back to myengdong instead and cab back to our hotel which cost us less than 10k won
1207,5,On top of the tower u r able to see the whole Seoul Its beautiful especially at night the view is breathtaking But during winter its too cold to stay for longer
1208,3,we came here on a rainy afternoon and saw nothing it was foggy and couldnt enjoy the views its not worth the trip if its rainingdrizzling
1209,4,The views were spectacular You could literally see the entire city and it is beautiful It was kind of expensive so I could only give it a 4 out of 5 rating I would still recommend it The lines are kind of long to get in to the elevator that takes you to the observation level There is a gift shop snack bar and the highest post office in Seoul There is also a really nice restaurant but I didnt go there We took the sky tram down to the outdoor elevator which is really coolwe learned the hard way and walked up from where the city bus dropped us offits a hike
1210,5,Wonderful hike to the top of Namsang Mountain  and a good place to see Seoul from the top A restaurant in the upper level is a nice cafe
1211,3,We couldnt see anything because of smog There were long queues but it was quite a nice thing to do Would only do it if you have seen everything else Plus the photo booth guy was hot 
1212,2,Didnt quite enjoy this visit as it was packed with tourists from the bus journey all the way to the top of the tower  Instructions to get there by Bus 5 Myeongdong Exit 3 walk straight to bus stop If you are at Exit 2 walk in the opposite direction of the exit  there is another Tour Bus Stop at Exit 2 in front of the Prince Hotel but THIS IS NOT THE STOP  The bus stop is likely very crowded as it serves many other busses other than Bus 5 You should see the Bus 5 route see attached picture  Take the bus for about half an hour to get to the top of the hill
1213,5,If you are in Seoul you have to check out the tower The view of Seoul alone is worth it Take the 5 bus up the mountain from the Myengdong station right out the subway exitit is cheap using the City pass card which is worth getting while in Korea I didnt make it up in the observatory due to the price but we went to the N Burger which was good I saw a glimpse of the locks and got good photos of the view Def a must see
1214,4,Took the advice from TripAdvisor and visited Seoul Tower around 4pm to catch the sunset Its abit confusing to reach Namsan Park Cable Car station We took a cab and the driver said we have to walk up the slope as cars are not allowed  So we took a feeder bus outside e slope instead of walking up the steep slope After 2 stops we reached the entrance of the Seoul Tower Such a beautiful sight despite the crowds nicer than the Peak in HK We didnt take the ride to Seoul Tower as we want to walk around the love locks area before it gets dark  By 5pm the skies get darker and weather getting colder Had churros and hot chocolate at one of restaurants A pleasant place to visit and you may wish to come earlier to explore the rest of the park
1215,5,From the bus terminal at Namsan Park we walked up to the tower even though some of us have slight problem in walking On that sunny day it looked great even from outside After buying the tickets we were guided to the elevator to go up to the Observatory Terrace Remember to look at the ceiling of the elevator for the video shown At the Observatory Terrace you can see the entire city view Some windows have displayed the distances from that direction towards many popular cities around the world A souvenir shop is available to handle your shopping desires Washroom and restaurant are just 1 floor down Overall a must go in a sunny day
1216,3,Nice place to visit but we went on a hazy day and couldnt get to see much The family package for 4 persons was worth it Included lunch in Italian restaurant tickets up to observation tower and a family photo shot  The place was also a favourite for young couples to as there were an area where the fence was completely fill up with locks from young couples pledging their love for each other Very romantic place to take a leisurely stroll  On our way down from the platform we were entertained with a traditional show at the concourse showing their martial art which was interesting
1217,3,Sitting at the peak of Seoul it is the N tower or Seoul Tower Suppose to be a romantic place because this is the place where love is symbolized by locks that is attached to a love fences at the base of the tower  It is very crowded even in winter night the lighting is also very pleasing to the eye To get to the base tower is easy use the provided cable car for free  Recomended for couple or fotographer
1218,4,One should visit the Tower between 3 to 5pm in winter provided that the weathers good as the sunset views were amazing It was pretty cold but panoramic sights were worth it
1219,4,The price is ok for an observation deck but the smoghaze means you cant see too far on most days it seems Visibility was about 5km but this didnt mean it wasnt worth it
1220,4,Like Taipei 101 this place allows you to send home postcards  lovely views at Observatory Tower which one must pay to go up And go when the sun sets where you can see the city come alive at night Also dont forget to get a lock to lock in your love
1221,4,We visited this place in the evening We had to walk up a steep and I mean steep haha slope up to the tower Can see that some of us had a bit of difficulty in the cold weather walking up me included Didnt see much of the tower but just took photos of Seoul from the outside deck The night view of Seoul was beautiful
1222,4,N Seoul Tower located on top of Seoul city have gondola sky view tower view and terrace park view with Seoul city view We can see the sunset and have a great time with familly or friends
1223,5,I went to Namsan during winterDecember and the experience was fantastic We were supposed to take a bus up to the peak but we ended up alighting at the foot of the mountain as we saw alot of people alighting at that stop It turns out that that is actually the stop to take the cable car up the mountain However I did not regret alighting at the bus stop We ended up hiking up the mountain at night and the experience was fantastic We hiked slowly and the whole journey took 1 hour The scenery was beautiful and the experience was great After reaching the summit we felt even better as we did it by foot The place is simply beautiful and the trip is definitely worth it
1224,5,Finding my way to the place was easy thanks to the information people you can find in almost all the places Ive been to in Seoul and they all speak English I was given a map in English with landmarks that were easy to find and very accurate At first when I arrived to NSeoul tower there was a long line because of peak season but the lines were all moving fast and it was well coordinated Once I got to the top the view was breathtaking I went at night The price was good and the food there was great I ate at the burger place Definitely a romantic place to enjoy
1225,4,Ive been to namsan tower several times and the last I visit was last winter in december with my friend I recomend to visit at night Im not lying the view is fantastic the beautiful of its lights will make your night more memorable on seoul 
1226,5,The view over the city was amazing the montain and the national parc was dressed for autumn and it was really worh going here The elevators are fast
1227,4,We were travelling late evening using cable car to get to the tower Very comfortable and safe Good view to night city Cafeteria on the top is OK Takeaway memory  you can have 4pattern tower view foto  One of Seoul MUST VISIT places
1228,3,My husband and I visited this place in mid October 2015 via the cable car There was no queue since we went on a weekday in early morning It was a pleasant visit since we were able to experience the panoramic view of the city during a very clear autumn day It became slightly crowded during the day later due to the sudden influx of school children
1229,4,This is one of the structure that stood out in my mind when I think of the buildings I saw in Seoul The tower is particularly beautiful at night with the very bright blue shinning strong in the darkness It is a great place to go for a few pics especially at night
1230,4,Seoul tower is best in the night U can get a taxi to the base from where you need to get to a cable car The night journey in the cable car is spectacular over the thick trees with the surrounding illuminated city of SeoulFrom there there is a high speed elevator to the top of the tower  over 200 metres which is completed in just over 30 seconds There are restaurants where u can dine
1231,3,This is the best place you can get the view of whole Seoul The view are great and even from the toilet there are glass walls for you to view the city Must go to the glass where the name of your city is labelled on it then you will know how far is your home city from the spot you are standing Go a 360 degree the whole tower and you see how far is North Korea which is just over the mountain in Seoul city We followed a private chartered one day Seoul city tour therefore I do not how much is the entry ticket cost
1232,3,Been there at around 7pm during a weekday and there was a long queue for the tram Not too crowd up there and there are a few dining options available When we tried to go back down in town at around 10pm the queue was even longer Be prepared to queue up
1233,5,If you visit Seoul one of the most iconic structures to see is the Seoul Tower also known as Namsan Tower You can get to the tower by taking a bus or cable car To take a bus you simply take the subway line 3 to Dongguk University Station Exit 6 Around the corner do not cross at the light there is a bus stop You can take bus 2 3 or 5 but bus 2 is the one that comes the most often It is best for you to have a Tmoney card so that when you transfer from the subway to the bus it will not cost you anything The bus stops at the bottom of a very steep incline that you need to walk up to get to the tower It is not advised to take this route if you have bad knees or other ailments To get to the cable car take subway line 4 light blue to the Myeongdong station then take exit 7 or 8 You can wait for the shuttle bus or you can walk to the elevator Walk in the direction of traffic along the main road towards Shinsegae department store and Hoehyeon station direction You will come to a big junction at the end of the road turn left and continue walking You will see the elevator but unlike normal elevators this one is very different It moves up at an angle rather than straight up and down From there you will have to purchase a ticket for the cable car 800010000 won You will get a scenic view of Seoul as the car which is usually crowded makes its way up to the station on the top of the mountain From there you will have to climb some stairs to reach the tower This way is not nearly as strenuous as the hike up the steep hill however it is not advised for people who are claustrophobic Once you get to the tower you will find that there are several places to eat sit  relax and enjoy the view You can go up into the observation tower 10000 won and you will have a wonderful view of all of Seoul There is a restaurant above the observation level and there are several little trinkets you can buy at the tower It is a great place to spend an hour or so at
1234,3,Make sure you plan your time properly when you go there We had to wait for almost an hour getting to the cable car and another hour to get up to the tower Of course getting the cable car home was also another hour If you are taking the cable car be prepared for super steep road Wasnt expecting that all
1235,5,Food photos souvenirs and so much more to see and do Great at night Lots of people sights and sounds and a great way to get to know Seoul
1236,4,We went here in the evening and waited a total of 70mins from the line up to buy our gondola tickets and the ride up to the top You get a decent view in the gondola but they really pack you in Once at the top its a really nice view with lots of light and people around Theres a lot of lovelocks as well as some nice seating and restaurants We tried the N Burger which was pretty good
1237,3,The tower itself is unimpressive but the walk up the hill to it is very beautiful especially on a sunny day And good for fitness
1238,5,We went to many different places in Seoul and one of them was NTower Why you ask Well if not because it is one of the symbols in Seoul its a must for the view First of all we took the cable up to the tower for us it was to hot and humid to walk the way up When we were here we had the luck to be part of a event where they dressed you in hanbok and together with local people you did a ritual to warn the people of hostile powers   When we came up there we did the classic love lock  Its really cute of all the people to make different love texts to the one they love  where we also made a promise to come back here again  After that we went up in the tower and was just staring at the incredible view We ate an looked the great view took millions of pictures and then went back down again by walking the beautiful path down It was one of the best todo in Seoul and we highly recommend it  With return ticket Cable car cost 8500 wonadult  One way ticket Cable car cost 6000 wonadult  Boarding point Get of at Myeongdong Station Line 4 exit 3 and walk for about 15 min  following the right side of the Pacific Hotel
1239,4,spent some time here as part of the Hopon Hopoff City Bus Tour After a short walk up a steep slope the views are just great Nice setup at the top with some cultural performances cafes and viewing platforms Many locks present on the fences
1240,4,I went here during spring time April and it was still cold and foggy I think its mainly a tourist attraction for lovers The bottom of the tower if filled with colorful padlocks hearts and so cute messages Here are also some cute lovers benches around the place where you could take your pictures in Climbing up the tower you could see the city skyline it is beautiful both morning or evening
1241,3,Apparently you can trek to the tower from the centre of town but I did it as part of the Seoul City Bus Tour Show your bus ticket and receive a 10 discount on your ticket to the top of the tower  There are a couple of restaurants but I didnt try any of them I went for the views and as it was a clear day I was not disappointed 360 degree views of Seoul were amazing
1242,5,We went one night at 7 and the line was almost 2 hrs long We decided to come back another night right at 5 and the line was about an hour It was worth every minute You wont get these views anywhere else Tough to get pictures since the glass windows were dirtyscratched
1243,3,You can reach the entrance of the tower by ropeway Or climb up some stairs That took us not more than 5 minutes And we did it slowly Once you are at the entrance you can queue up It might take very long to get into the tower If you are looking for a free alternative to see Seoul from above go to the AhnMountain It is next to Seodaemun Prison History Hall Take metro to Dongnimmun station and walk It will take you maybe an hour but it is worth to see the city from here
1244,5,Amazing 360 degree view over Seoul incredibly happy and helpful staff Great burger restaurant on the ground floor as well
1245,5,A must to anyones visit to Seoul From a birdseye vantage see this sprawling city of over 10 million people see the new and old mixed together For those interested in history one can even see the remnants of the old wall that once protected Seoul from invaders as it connected the mountains surrounding the city
1246,3,My husband and me decided to walk up to N Tower instead of taking the cable car it was a long walk with steps catching our breath we stopped to take pictures along the way and was lovely looking down to the skyline of Seoul city despite the haze on that day when we were up there A good kind of exercise but u got to take it slow Wear comfortable shoe if u are walking up to the Tower
1247,4,I used to live in Seoul The city is incredibly big and you may easily get lost N Seoul Tower is located in the center of the city near Yongsan area Definitely the N Tower is an excellent place to start or end your visit to South Korea There are plenty of ways on how to get there Taxi Metro and Bus will do it but i think the cheapest is Metro and then changing to the bus I do not have in mind the bus lines but you can look them up on the internet I recommend you try to get up on both day and night since it is really beautifull and worth it The tower is located in a park so you might as well take a hike and enjoy the nature I might be wrong but I remember the entrance fee was around W3500000 per person From above you are going to see everything in Seoul
1248,5,This is something to see when visiting Seoul The views of the city from the top of the tower are breathtaking A highlight of our trip to South Korea
1249,5,The only thing better than the view from the top is the dining at the top Well worth the taxi ride and initial walk uphill to start
1250,2,Okay I suppose  but the view from the cable car up the hill was every bit as good as the view from the top of the tower but without the extortionate entry fee They also have signs up everywhere telling you youre not allowed to take photos  because they want to flog their overpriced official photos  I wouldnt go out of your way to go to this If anything just take the cable car to the base of the tower and enjoy the views from there
1251,5,I am awestruck by the view Looking out over the city in all directions is simply amazing A mix of large buildings bridges the river the mountains and the green parks will leave you speechless  Getting to the top offers a few options First you need to get to the base of the tower You can walk take a bus or take the Namsan Cable car We chose the cable car Just past the Myongdeong station exit near Namsan tunnel you will find a set of stairs or an elevator to the cable car station It was 8500 won per adult and 6500 per child We were there at opening 0930 and were first in line The car was packed when we went up but the views were spectacular  Once at the base there are multiple places to relax eat and sight see Bring a lock and lock it to the fence its a tradition To get the the observation deck you must pay There are multiple options Some include food drinks and other events We chose the popcorn and drink specials 20000 won for 2 tickets 1 popcorn and 2 drinks The popcorn was huge  The ride to the top was fast Once off the elevator the views were amazing The observation deck is enclosed clean and spacious There is souvenirs and a resteraunt  Overall we spent about 90000 won to get from the city to the top for 2 adults and 3 small children It was well worth it and we will never forget it
1252,2,Keeping in mind that the Souel tower is one of that smallest in Asia its way to expensive You pay a lot for the cable car and for the tower On The visitors platform are no marks or information if what there is to see and which buildungs are used for what porpuse So you got make a lot of guesses
1253,5,Namsan Tower is always a popular place for locals and tourists Its worth the visit  especially the view from the observation deck  and there are often traditional performances on weekends during the summer  LOCAL TIP Dont take the green N Seoul Tower tourist busses as theyre usually overcrowded and only run every 30 minutes Take Bus 3 from the bus stop on the main road closest to exit 4 of Itaewon Station Its a local neighbourhood bus takes the same amount of time and costs the same as the tourist bus but offers more busses and is far less crowded I also recommend taking the bus up no taxis allowed and the cable car 6000 KRW down which will bring you out in Myeongdong
1254,4,Really cool but the air quality can spoil the trip Make sure you go on a clear day Have a beer and enjoy the view
1255,5,We walked up to the Tower in the evening  it was welllit and a lovely scenic walk All very well paved so felt more like climbing public stairs than hiking There are viewing points as you go up that are great for getting good pictures  Once at the top there are many restaurants a cable car which we came back down with and an observation deck costing W10000 for access We went up to the viewing deck but this was inside with glass splattered with rain drops and light reflecting from the various tourist tat sellers  basically not really worth the money the time as it didnt give a much better view than what wed seen already and yielded poor quality photos  Over all worth it for the walk up and scenic views but not for the observation deck
1256,5,Went there during very clear day so the view was amazing I really enjoyed seeing Seoul from such an place Make sure to actually go up
1257,3,Nice sightseeing if you want to walk from the first entry it will take some time and strength cause it is in uphill The road along to the hill is really nice Once you got uphill the view is beautiful also You can see almost all Seoul
1258,3,took the bus ride from the nearest metro station in the evening and it was a beautiful ride Try to reach there in the evening so that you can enjoy it in day light and when lights are on In my personal opinion it is not worth the money you spend to go up the tower the view is much better from the hill top
1259,4,Giving it a 4 stars out of 5 The tower is not very fantastic but still worth the 4 stars  Good view and theres an observation area with locks locked on the railings Bring your steady to N Seoul tower to lock your love there
1260,3,We made it a point to visit the tower as it is iconic in Seoul We decided to visit in the evening as we wanted to see the colourful lights of Seoul We took the bus down the road from Exit 2 Chungmuro Station which took us up to foot of a hill We had to hike up the steep hill to get to the base of the tower It was very busy The tower was full of the locks of love It was quite an interesting sight The ticket counter person wasnt very nice Most people were standing around to check which was the best ticket to buy as they had couple combos etcand she kept asking us to move ahead We have no choice and had to choose something at the spur of the moment She was rude The journey up to the tower was speedy with a clip shown on the ceiling Once up there the view was incomparable  stunning It didnt take long for our feet to start aching as there were so many people around and so few seats When we were heading down we had to wait in a long queue which made our feet ache even more When we finally got down we decided to take the cable car down as it is supposedly part of the tower experience We had a very long wait as it was busy Our aching feet didnt enjoy the wait either There was nothing romantic about the cable car ride We were jam packed in a cable car of at least 30 people If i were to describe that experience Id say we felt like tunassardines in a can I would tell future travelers to give it a miss and take the bus instead Its cheaper and more convenient Dont waste precious time waiting to be packed into a sardine can When we got to the base of the cable car station we had to wait for the bus anyway Overall it was alright but not the best memory we had
1261,5,This is the best view of the city Combine your visit with a nice dinner  There are several restaurants Hankook seemed to me to offer the best value It certainly was enjoyable Bring your walking shoes  its a hike up the hill from the nearest bus or cable car stop and youll do some more walking inside the Tower complex including a few flights of stairs If you wait too long to leave you may have a long wait for the elevator back down But you get to see Seoul We went on July 4 and got to watch the fireworks down at Yongsan Army Garrison as well Just do it
1262,3,It was quite an effort to visit First we walked from myeongdong station up the mountains for like 1015 mins to get to the tram stop Paid an return fare thinking its late theres no way we would walk down the mountains Once we were up there more steps to walk fair enough we are not too fit to start with Anyways The night view was great but its very similar to all other big cities With heaps of light and buildings Shops there are overpriced Not many seats for people to rest And if you want to get up the ACTUAL TOWER you need to pay some extra money again which we did not bother Lucky we went on a week night there wasnt too many people to line up for the tram We actually took a taxi down from the tram stop to myeongdong station which was like less than 5 minutes but cost us heaps more than other taxitrips maybe they charge extra coming down from the mountains We didnt ask the driver was too tired after all
1263,4,Nice viewing point over Seoul Dont have the locals fool you that it is just a few minutes climb to get to the tower though it is quite a climb It is strongly advised to take the cable car Entrance to the tower itself is highly overpriced
1264,3,to be honest of u want a great view of seoul just hike up the hill where the tower is located Its not worth the cost to go up and spend like a couple of bucks in an overcrowded place
1265,5,Unfortunately I havent been at night which I would have loved to I loved the fact that I could send a post card directly from the top of the Tower I was with a group of friends and we bought a lock to add to the bridge of locks Its a high way up a hill to get to the bottom of the tower but worth it 
1266,4,Like most tourist attractions a tower a go to destination for a panoramic view of the city It just costs so much to go up  I skipped the popcorn option
1267,4,Amazing view  experience from top of Seoul It provides a 360 degree view of the city esp beautiful during night time The short elevator ride too is worth attention Love lock on the sidewalks are amazing
1268,5,Been here twice During the day and night I prefer at night as its cooler and romantic to do love lock with your partner You can see seoul lights from above A pretty sight be prepare to hike a bit and used snickers for convenient Avoid hills please
1269,5,Like may cities that have a tower from which to best see the city the Seoul Tower does not disappoint Its a steep walk up a hill so wear comfortable shoes
1270,3,Views of Seoul at night are nice  but nothing truly breathtaking Love locks on the viewing platform were a nice touch but not quite as romantic as in Paris of course  Long lineups for the cable car up and spent just under an hour for the whole attraction Plenty of tourists with selfie sticks and can indeed get busy during the evenings  Can pass if you are strapped for time
1271,5,The view of Seoul is breathtaking The place is very well organized guests are accommodated orderly I love the photo booth
1272,5,Vising towers that have restaurants is our weakness and mustdo wherever we go This tower was not a disappointment Excellent views from observatory and hill itself plus absolutely amazingly delicious lunch at Hancook restaurant This was the most impressive restaurant in Korea we have been to Totally worth the price The best way to get to the tower is taking one of the shuttle busses 02 03 or 05 You will need to walk uphill a little bit to reach the tower so take it into account if you are tired or not very sporty If you are into photography sunset views are obstructed by other tower and trees Night views are spectacular sunrise probably too though we havent come there in the morning Burger place is not the best burger place as they say it Very mediocre
1273,5,Great view of the city of Seoul You have to ride a cable car and its an awesome experience Aside from this view you might want to goof around first in Love Locks and some stores before going to N Seoul
1274,5,As one of the over aged people to visit the tower  the help I received was incredibleI have difficulty walking I had assistance all the time for my visitThe views are awesome and the all round facilities of the Tower are superb If you are incapacitated in any way do go up the tower
1275,5,The scenery was romantic as you can see all Seoul from this place and lock your wish with your loved one To go there was also very beautiful with lush trees everywhere and panorama spots for taking pics the place was also uphill hence very healthy for tracking
1276,4,Highly recommended for first time visitors to Seoul The view is astonishing and there are plenty of space to relax and enjoy the view
1277,5,This was such a nice respite from the hustle and bustle of the city down below We werent aware that theres a bus you can take to the tram station so we hiked up a fairly steep hill to get there not a big deal for those in decent shape but if youre elderly you might want to locate the bus stop and drive up instead  Once you get on the tram to get up to the top of the mountain youll be able to see a gorgeous view of the city down below There are so many adorable love locks everywhere It definitely gave me the warm and fuzzies to see so many examples of people family and friends in love 3 There are a few vendors at the top selling locks so you can buy them up there they have permanent pens you can write with as well We took our time strolling around and checking out the view from many vantage points  It was a very nice afternoon well spent 
1278,4,Another mustvisit in Seoul a touristy place perhaps but its not that bad I spent less than KRW20000 for a return cablecar ticket a cup of latte and an icecream; and I was done taking photos around the tower in less than an hour Tips for those who wish not to spend much money there  just power walk to the tower dont take the cable car   The park is very well maintainedkept The view of Seoul from the outdoor observatory was just breathtaking The lovelocks are pretty to see There are restaurantscafesstalls as well as souvenir shops At a fee the observatory in the tower can be visited It is worth a visit as its a symbol of Seoul after all
1279,4,I been Seoul many time but I must visit N seoul Tower every time when I am there Difference season you have difference feeling of the city You get fresh air and beautiful view of the city i day or night N Seoul Tower is easy to access by taxi or by local bus You also can take cable car from Myeongdong cable car station  If you have time  you can have a slow walk and wonder around the Namsan park
1280,5,Its very fast and convenient The view is breathtaking and especially for couples which are in love there are ao many lockers  dont worry if u dont have one you can get a pair for 7000 won There is a nice terrace with panoramic view and there are also restaurants where you can eat and georgeous icecream also Highly recommend eapecially if the day is sunny
1281,3,A great view of seoul from this tower Good place for couple to lock their love using paddle lockdont forget to take picture at the chair outside of the tower Ohya u need climb up the hill before u get there
1282,5,Though it was rainy day it was a great pleasure to have a trip to Seoul Tower The view is incredible the nature is so so niceAlso there were some beautiful corners to seeSo i highly recommend do visit that while you are in Seoul
1283,4,We were driven up to the tower during the day hoursbHowever once you get dropped off there is still a hill to conquer Once you are upof coursethe view is of Seoul Once you go around the circle then there is the tourist shop There are more downstairs including restaurants and the locks area Ive been to many towers and this is just average I probably would not go back again
1284,4,A good climbwalk for walking enthusiasts The top is dominated by few cafes with exorbitantly priced food and drinks But refreshing to reach the top take pictures and have a nice cold beer and watch the world go by
1285,4,A great way to see this sprawling city We did the walk up through the beautiful park which features a magnificent stone wall built through different dynasties hence in different ways Statues along the walk plus the gardens and cherry blossom trees made this spectacular as the blossoms were falling and the tulips blooming We walked all the way which was ok as we are fit The bus was an option and there were many Once at the Tower there was the opportunity to place a lovers lock on one of the many Christmas like trees as thousands before had done dont be concerned if you forget your lock they are for sale from the gift shops  The 23 second lift ride to the viewing level was well worth the vista that awaited This is a clean and sprawling city We went back down grabbed a beer and sat in lounge chairs overlooking Seoul before starting the trek back down A must see
1286,5,Beautiful view by night over Seoul Its impressive and romantic too For dinner you need to make a reservation in advance
1287,3,Take a leisurely stroll up Namsan Park or take the cable car to N Seoul Tower where you get to enjoy a breathtaking view of Seoul and and surrounding landscape Unfortunately the windows werent very clean and reflections made it impossible to take any decent pictures  Note Internet access mobile is very limited up there We were planning to have a quiet cup of coffee in the cafe in the tower enjoying the views and some light surfing but had to settle for only the views
1288,3,The only thing thats makes this attraction worth it is the view It is not cheap just to go up and the restaurant up top is priced as a very nice diner place  way off
1289,4,The location is ideally for couples who want to put their names on a padlock as a promise of their love for each other I enjoyed walking along the path going to N Tower though its a bit tiring going up there but it was all worth it I took photos beside the lovelock trees
1290,5,Beautiful a must see I recommend to walk up the stairs as it offer multiple view sites along the way and a better experience then riding the cart
1291,4,I got the chance to join the bandwagon of placing our love padlocks At the same time since it is located in the mountain Ive enjoyed the view and the weather very much We were welcomed with a very cool breeze as the night falls It was an amazing experience Too bad the teddy bear museum was already closed
1292,4,The Seoul N Tower visit was great and the views truly are spectacular Just a couple of things to keep in mind  do be ready to walk a little bit and be on your feet for a while Try and avoid Saturday nights  the number of visitors is unbelievable and youll spend a lot of time waiting in line The gift shops are awesome and so are the restaurants And lastly  this goes without saying  pick a clear night so you can make the most of the fantastic views Youll see a lot of people taking selfies  but seriously just take a couple of shots and spend the rest of the time soaking in the views I went at night and it was spectacular
1293,4,Going to the N Seoul Tower was a bit challenging but was worth it As others have said you may opt not to go to the observatory deck because you see enough at the base level Quite pricey for visiting the area though The cable car fee entrance fee food souvenirs plus a different entrance fee for alive museum but all in all still worth the one time visit And yes literally thousands of love padlocks in the love wall Very nice place indeed
1294,4,Seoul can be smoggy Hiking some of the mountains in and around Seoul can provide a nice reprieve from air quality If you want a quick break away Namsan Tower is a good alternative There are a few ways up You can walk from Namsan Park following the road You can walk up the stairs through the park You can take a cable car up When you get to Namsan Seoul Tower you can hang out at the base of the tower which is where you can sign a lock with a message grab a bite to eat  sometimes catch an outdoor cultural performance If you pay an extra 9000 won you can take a 30 second elevator ride to the top of the tower where you can get a good view of the city depending on the weather grab an expensive cup of coffee and then come down The view in the evening is great and then afterward you can walk down and hang out in Myeongdong for a full night
1295,4,Obviously a nice view  Seoul has a lot of fog some days so make sure to pick up the right day Nice souvenirs to purchase You can bring padlocks of love  I would say its an average view tower of any big city You will enjoy 
1296,4,We took the cable going up and down cost 8500 won The view from the top was lovely The area was clean We bought a pad lock cost 5000 won and hang it on the love lock wall There were food shops We tried the ice cream with churros not good but not bad either You can have lunch or dinner at the tower They offer packages of lunch plus observatory deck and observatory deck plus alive museum I would to come back again just to see if our pad lock will still be there
1297,4,I went up this mountain in the late afternoon about 4pm I took a bus at the foot of the mountain forgot which bus service by using the public transport card It was a pretty steep road up and the bus was filled with people The place was packed with people probably to catch the sunset too Went up the tower by elevator at about 6pm Stood by the window facing the far right of Han River and caught the magnificent sunset Great experience Walked down the mountain by foot using the stairs Great view of city lights and breathing through the clean air
1298,4,This is a recommended place to visit while in Seoul Although its not too high but you can view all the Seoul city from here  It is clean it is nice especially the door lock trees below the tower Very unique  Duration of visit 12 hours
1299,5,We took the cable car to the N tower It was a Sunday evening when we visited so do expect crowd We had to wait for quite some time to get on the gondola Once you get off from the gondola there are wood staircases that will lead you to the lock area and the tower You can catch a nice sunset view at the staircases There do sell the locks at the famous lovers lock area so do not worry if you didnt manage to get one before the visit The seller will also lend you a marker so you can declare your love on the locks before you lock it away do not throw the keys to the park below as there is a designated box for you to throw the keys Afterwards take the staircase up to get the tickets to the viewing deck to enjoy a breathtaking view of Seoul at night Beautiful
1300,4,Besides these attractions in the N Seoul Tower there are a couple of shops and icecream shop which was way too cold to go near A touristy store which sold mini N Seoul Towers The view was really nice you could see entire Seoul city in the night and truly worth the climb up the hill
1301,4,We took the lift to the cable car and the to the viewing deck It was enjoyable to sit and have a coffee and a lovely view of Seoul Again as someone else said during the cherry blossom season it must be lovely I recommend it if you have a few spare hours to kill It was lovely to see the young Seoulite families with their adorable children enjoying themselves
1302,4,Best experience ever i took the stairs instead of cable carSUPER TIREDits was like more than 3k stepsi guess but i feel satisfiednice viewamazing i was so surprised all e lights just impressed me worth to visit
1303,3,Went to seoul tower last sunday Took cable car up to seoul tower The cable car was too crowded with tourists and local tourists The place was good It will be better if visit in april as there will be cherry blossom However the place is still very nice Went to see the love locks it wasnt ul to my expectations and it was very commercialized We went up to the observatory but we cannot see much views from top as the glasses are too dirty We cannot take picture clearly Since it is for people to go up to view seoul from high point the glasses should be wipe often
1304,4,I love the view when I went up N Tower and it was a WOW  The walk up a really long ramp was all worth it Spent the sunset watching over Seoul
1305,4,One of mustvisit place in Seoul   Night view of Seoul is so fantastic and made me regular visitor of N Seoul Tower Lights from buildings street lamps and traffic jams are making beautiful scenery every nights   Entrance fee is reasonableabout 10USD compared to another well known observatoriesTokyo Skytree Shanghai Oriental Pearl Tower Seattle Space Needle   Even in rainycloudy days this tower shows you very unique view But I dont recommend to visit here in bad weather days However if you already have been here many times rainycloudy view from observatory will give you another nice experience   The 5th floor of observatory is revolving restaurant which is reservationrequiredgenerally you need to make a reservation 34 days before for weekday and very expensivemost of dinners cost more than 100 USD But it is best place to have a dinner with special person
1306,3,a great location to see the sky view of seoul A mustsee checkpoint for all the travellers in Seoul Suggest to go there at night sunset to see the beautiful view of seoul at night sunset
1307,3,If you have been to Eiffel tower in Paris then you may feel the long lineup isnt justified My family waited for over 1 hour to get on the cable car to take us to the tower When we got there we realized how short the tower was It was decorate with lights to make it more attractive but its nothing compared to the Eiffel Tower taipei 101 or even IFC in Hong Kong The walk up and down the tower to the cable car station is pretty nice though as it is a nicely preserved park with good walking trails
1308,3,I realize that Kdramas gave me illogical expectations for this place I blame Do Min Joon  I liked the exercise of the trek up the hill towards the cable car station The cable car experience my first was like standing in the MRT during rush hour though the view below is beautiful so find a good spot near the glass We went and paid the KRW9000 to go up the observatory but it was disappointingly small compared to those in Macau and Shanghai It was an unnecessary expense Personally I think an hour roaming around the love lock platforms and watching out for free outdoor shows would be enough Might have been a better view of the lights if we went at night but then it would be hella freezing
1309,3,The views were ok but the windows were dirty so even if you wanted to get a good shot of the city you couldnt Im comparing it to Tokyo tower so maybe thats my problem  if youve never been to a city tower like this then I think you should go but if you have I think youll be disappointed
1310,3,The N Tower provides some great views of Seoul especially at night Unfortunately the cost of going up the towers is expensive and no really worth the cost Spend your money else where
1311,5,This is such a prominent land mark of Seoul that a visit to Seoul will not be complete unless it is visited It gives you a high vantage pint to see a 360 unobstructed view of Seoul Worth every penny of the ticket to go up to its observation deck
1312,3,Something you should do in every city is to go to the highest peak point to have a overall look of the city  N Seoul Tower is exactly the place to do that  Quite cold  breezy during the winter and chilling like any other place in Seoul  The cable car comes quickly however it is not the usual small cable car with seats It is of the larger ones where a lot people gets packed into it in a standing position  Theres food available around the tower and also the famous lovelock thingy  The tower itself however is quite small and the overall place will take less than an hour to be fully explored  The walk from the nearest subway station to the cable car station is quite tedious youll have to do some 1530 mins walk depending on your speed and climb some slope while doing it Throw in some 5 degree celcius winter breeze then youll have some unpleasant experiences
1313,4,Tourists could reach NSeoul Tower either by hiking by citytour bus or by a cable car It was almost sunset when we took a ride via cable car from our rented guesthouse at Namsan after half an hour of waiting for our turn to purchase for ticket Cable car was filled with people so you could hardly move and get some photos of yourselves while going up to the top of the hill It was only after we alighted up there when we had the glimpse of NSeoul Tower vividly so captivating with its colorful and dazzling lights It was too windy and very cold outside due to onset of winter season But we managed to stroll and had our picturetakings around for 2 hours Lastly Jim had treated us for a sumptuous dinner in one of the cafes why it was coincidentally his birthday We lost the chance to be at the peak of the tower but nevertheless the feel to be at NSeoul Tower was enough to utter its a worthwhile and momentous experience
1314,5,We got there by bus city tour bus  namsam stop The view from the tower is great but the windows were quite dirty so I couldnt take pictures The best spot is actually at the base of the tower next to the ticketing booth to the right go up the stairs which is free and no windows Have fun 
1315,3,The view from the top of Seoul Tower is great You can see the entire Seoul city below you Take the cable car if you think the walk up Mount Namsan is too challenging The Sky Restroom one floor down from the top has walltowall glass panels that afford you the same view while relieving yourselves  On the way there you will come across a platform full of locks that presumably couples attach to profess their love for each other In the old days the place Mount Namsan was one of the smoke signal relay posts to warn of enemy attack The post is manned by guards and if you come at the right time there is a changing of the guards ceremony  Although Seoul Tower is like an icon I think it is not one of those places that one must visit in Seoul if you are pressed for time
1316,4,You will need a lot of patiences to visit this tower Make sure you arrive more than an hour or two before sunset if you plan to watch it go down The gondola lines are long going up which cost and then you must wait in another line to pay to go up the tower but not before getting in another line to get up the lifts so please go very early There are restaurants and soveneir shops at the base and a candy and more soveneir shops at the top of the tower The view is the whole reason people wait in those lines which is lovely
1317,3,It is very very very very very crowded I have been to 35 countries but this was the busiest place I had to wait If you are going with a good shape just use stairs If you decide to wait for an elevator and a cable car it takes forever I mean forever hours and hours It was very very cold and I could see the snow on the ground It was beautiful at the top but the view is the same everywhere to be honest at nightnothing special I would not do it
1318,4,We went at night and got a great view of the city Getting there by cab isnt possible so the cab will drop you off at a bus that goes up the hill After getting off the bus theres a steep uphill walk that will be tough if youre out of shape or elderly Taking the cable car may be simpler and easier although Im not sure where it drops off wish we had done that  Once at the top of the hill you can get good pictures from outside but even better if you buy tickets and take the elevator to the top of the tower They have the expected souvenirs for sale as well as stamps and a mailbox for sending postcards all reasonably priced
1319,3,While you cannot miss seeing this tower from pretty much everywhere in Seoul going to its upper levels is certainly not a must The tower is located at the peak of mount Namsan in the middle of the park Theres a very nice view from the ground floor of the tower back at the cafe so theres no real need to go up the tower thus saving apx 9 US for the ticket to the observation deck In case you do decide to go make sure its a bright day otherwise youd be looking into clouds and fog
1320,4,N Seoul Tower open all year round romantic hot spot outside the park is free admissiononce enter the tower there will be a fee impose Operation Hour inside the tower 1000hr2300hr What is in there A Love Messenger N Sarang Gom B Your Love Come True Wishing Pond C Get Closer To Your Love One Heart Chair D Promise Your Eternal Love Love Padlock  Restaurant and cafe end at 2200hr N photo area end at 2230hr Alive Museum end at 2230hr  1Observatory Deck Won 9000 per adult Restaurant and Cafe 2 Alive Museum Won 12000 per adult
1321,4,it is best to go here at night to see the entire city in lights wear jacket because its cold if you are into hiking climb the mountain to the tower or climb down you can also go to the tower through the cable car cable car is not cheap you can either ride the cable car up to the tower and climb down the stars if youre going home theres another fee to enter the tower itself the fee is not cheap and there seems not much to be seen so i didnt go inside
1322,4,You get some great views of the city as this is the highest point in Seoul We went there in the evening and I think the view of the lit up city is better then that in the day light
1323,5,a real lookin tower and you really right on top of a mountain and couples go for a date and enjoy the sunset which is not to be missed 
1324,5,We went there at dinner time  ate burgers at the restaurant there Then we took the elevator to the top to see the city lights It was fun to see the city just before dark  after it got dark  the city lights were on The restaurant was spendy but a fun treat
1325,4,Went to this attraction alone  big mistake Ive never felt so alienated in my life as I have been here Man S Korea is obsessed about having a boyfriendhusband I probably looked so lonely to them which was the complete opposite mind you I came in around 1400 and the cable car was packed I think I waited about 40 minutes to finally be on my way to the tower I was told its better to see the city from the tower at night but I didnt have enough time and it was my last day in the city There was a show in the main courtyard  I just really wish the cheesy commercial in the elevator was not so directed at love and having a boyfriend and all that Seriously the mascot is a CGI bear that helps this guy get the girl he likes and they go on a date in the tower Oh and the barricade is filled with those heavy locks with names of couples hoping to make it forever just like the love bridge in Paris but guess what that broke haha Maybe Im just your typical American single girl whos jaded in all these cheesy things but marketing should be inclusive not alienating There were kids there seeing the commercials  already being groomed that in life all you need is a mate to take to Seoul Tower and nothing more  So the views are great and I enjoyed my time here I just wish they didnt blatantly make a point that Seoul Tower is for couples
1326,3,Bit of a bizaare onethe cable cart up is a fun way of getting there but be prepared for the wait we visited off season and still had a sizeable wait  The area around the tower is pretty tacky and commercialised but this is only the forerunner to the tower itself which is rammed with things to buy pick and mix at the top of a viewing platform really Unfortunately not a classy tower like most other viewing platforms  A good view across Seoul but lets be honest this isnt the most attractive city best viewed at dusk or night time dont get hung up on visiting this tower if it doesnt fit in with your time scale
1327,4,We got to the tower by bus number 5 outside exit 3 of Myeongdong station paid 950 won per pax It went a big loop before reaching the tower If you want to get there fast then take the cablecar After we alighted at the terminal at the tower we have to walk a very steep slope before reaching ittiringHowever the view will make you forget about the tiredness NICE We went in the night so cannot comment on the day view Must go place in Seoul
1328,4,Nice view over the city I recommend to visit the tower as the first sightseeing to get an impression of this huge city in development A lot of young couples leave lovelocks here like in Paris
1329,5,Visited on September 25th 2014 Came in the afternoon in order to see the city while there is light and in the dark too There were many people there but it wasnt as crowded as Ive read in other reviews The wait for the cable car was not long just 1 car went up before our turn came and so wasnt the line for the tower It was a very pleasant experience You have to pay for the cable car which brings you to the top of the hill and then pay again for the tower The views were lovely You can see the mountains surrounding the city the river the modern areas the hills  its beautiful The sun was setting and it was a big red ball Everyone were taking pictures yet there was room for all near the windows Outside the tower theres food there are the famous love lock trees and bench and theres a viewing platform Also theres a fountain which is fun for children where they can run between the streams Its wheelchair accessible you may need some help to overcome the slope from the top cable car station to the area around the tower You even get discounts on tickets to the cable car and the tower I think its a must experience After that you can descend by foot to Myeong Dong market area which is a lovely pedestrian area to visit in the evening
1330,4,If you want to have a good view of Seoul this is the place to go it is great If you are visiting Seoul a few days the best thing to do is to take the City tour bus and use these as one of your stops  because it takes you all the way up to the tower Easy way up and you have a 360 view Before going to the tower check the weather Of course you need a good day to enjoy the view
1331,4,First trip we were unaware of the shuttle bus and the cable cars so we made the long trek up the mountain Have to say it was challenging and our last time doing that But the trip was worth the view You and your partner can place a lock on the many designated areas to represent friendship or everlasting love Me and my wife placed ours in 2012 and by our second time there were so many locks we could not find ours But we will place another one shortly At the very top one can view a magnificent view of Seoul Back in 88 this place was no where near where it is at now So to see what Seoul blossom into is just amazing  To get there you want to get off at Myeongdong Station and wait for the many shuttle buses that runs through or walk up the hill across the street from Myeongdong Station and you will come up to the cable cars which is pretty cool
1332,4,You havent gone to Seoul if you havent gone to Namsan Tower Locals and tourists alike flock to the tower all day but most especially during late afternoon to get a glimpse of the beautiful sunset and a panoramic view of the city from dusk til night You can take the cable car but if you want to save some won you can take the subway  bus from Chungmuro Stn Exit 2 take bus 02 leading to the tower For details on the cable car and things to do at Namsan Tower visit visitkoreas website httpenglishvisitkoreaorkrenuSISI_EN_3_6jspcid260067
1333,5,Firstly if youre a man dont miss going to the toilets at the top of the tower One of the best views youll ever have while you take a nature break Great views of the city lights at night It was quite crowded at the base of the tower But not as many people pay the extra to go up so it wasnt as bad up at the top It is definitely worth going up
1334,5,the view is awesome during the night  its a must visit for couple  u can buy the love lock and lock it on the trees  went during march its superb cold during night time advise to wear thicker
1335,4,Although I usually avoid tourist attractions when traveling this particular one turned out to be a good experience The tower is located in a nice park and a cable car takes you right up to the lookout platform There is some climbing involved so wear comfortable shoes While we were there there was a cultural performance that was entertaining There is also a gift shop inside with some nice souvenirs The best part however is the spectacular panoramic view of the city Be sure and visit on a clear day to take full advantage of this birds eye view
1336,3,With the Seoul lock museum and the viewing deck at the N Seoul Tower it is no wonder why this destination is easily flocked by young couples The N Seoul Tower is a perfect spot for that promise of love with the spots breathtaking view and the chilly weather Cuddle up
1337,5,The gem of our trip to South Koreaspent the early afternoon and late evening  slowly taking this amazing view of this vibrant city from the highest point of Seoul breathtaking scene of their river with my lovely wife on our 34th wedding anniversary 
1338,5,If you plan to visit Seoul N Seoul Tower is the spot you need to visit You can look down the whole view of the capital city at the observatory The beautiful Seoul will visit you with memorable experiences
1339,3,Went there by car Love the view Also I can see it everyday from my bedroom window at my brothers 20th floor apartment
1340,4,If you are going to N Seoul Tower better if you ride the cable car going up as private vehicles are only allowed at certain point This entails a lot of walking but the view at the top is beautiful Going to the tower pay attention to the short presentation when you are riding the elevator Once you reached the tower it will give you a breathtaking view of Seoul Love is all around You can buy a postcard and send it to your loved one Another interesting view is the locks of love and the heart chair There are also restaurants to feed your hungry tummy
1341,5,I have been living in South Korea for 12 years I have been to Seoul tower for 5 times since 2003 Seoul tower has been maintained well and worth for visiting during sunny days Below Seoul tower there are some entertainments like Teddy bear museum and photographic zones
1342,5,Its a very interesting place for those who would like to see seoul from the bird eye view But do not go there during weekend Cuz you gonna line up for few hours to get up there
1343,3,Food and drinks are available for some entrance packages  Overlooking Seoul Theres a postbox where you could drop your love letters but not sure if someone will really deliver them  Few activities here Theres a wishing well souvenir shop candy store and telescopic viewers  Small place Can get crowded One servicing elevator You might wait for a while until you can go up or down the tower
1344,4,We enjoyed our time here You can see beautiful views of the city The cable car ride was a bit stuffy going up We enjoyed adding a lock to one of the trees We took the elevator up to the top there was a bit of a wait between elevators but the lines moved quickly It was hard to take pictures because it was a little crowded but not too bad
1345,4,I think the tower is a must see for the fantastic 360 view Having said that it can be a bit of an effort I took a taxi which can only go so far then its a more than 2 km walk uphill unless you can hitch a ride with a tour bus as I did then you still have to walk another 50 metres or so Coming back down I diverted onto a treelined track that I thought would take me to my starting point I was wrong and ended up about a km from where I should have been and some kind locals guided me to the road where I could take a taxi
1346,5,The location of the tower is perfect from the top you can enjoy the view of each side of Seoul city Id recommend to visit the place late afternoon the sun will give nive light over the city and you can enjoy the view before going to the top and get there around the sunset to see all the city light for photographers; tripod is a must Getting to the tower is pretty simple and easy no need to take the train unless you are lazy
1347,3,We took the cable car up to the top of Namsan Park  N Seoul Tower view is ok For first timer might be a good idea to see Seoul
1348,4,To reach the great tower of Seoul you can do it in three ways walk along the path that leads uphill to the tower using the cableway or reaching the top of the hill through the service bus I chose the bus cheaper and more convenient From the bus stop near the tower you need to walk down a hill for about 200 meters before reaching the ticket desk The price of the ticket is expensive in my opinion leads to the tower through a ticket number as there is a high influx of visitors for example if 50 people get out no more than 50 people can get in You reach the top of the tower with an ultrafast elevator the view from up there is fantastic Seoul from the top is amazing This experience although a bit expensive I think it is absolutely worth trying
1349,4,Cable car ride was fun but crowded The views on a clear day are spectacular and breathtaking Seoul is a beautiful city A must see while in Korea
1350,4,We went here thru cable car The queue is a bit long but short waiting time to ride to the top Once you get up there the view at the top is amazing
1351,5,The trip to the N tower started with several meters worth of walking from the Myong Dong shopping area Weather was fine and breezy and before we knew it we were at the admissions area for the transport to the site A relaxing cable car trip took us to the top of the where the N tower was situated A few more steps up and we were at the tower We took a short trip inside the Bear Museum which was a delight even to adults The tower itself gives a sight to behold You will find location references in the tower to orient you as to which direction you are setting your sights at Lots of souvenirs inside You will never go hungry because there are many restaurants to choose from To end the trip we bought and placed a lock on the Namsan Love Lock trees just to be part of it This one is truly a place worth going to
1352,3,N Seoul Tower is a nice place to visit if you want to see Seouls night view The cable card ride up to Namsan was pleasant Its best to be at the cable car station before sunset So by the time you reach Namsan youll be able to see Seoul both during sunset and at night We did not go up the tower though as we didnt want to queue Couples can purchase locks and put it up at the fencing It would be more economical to buy a return ticket for the cable car Another alternative is to take the bus up which cost a fraction of the price It is interesting to take the Namsan Oreumi to get to the cable car station From Myeongdong Station Exit 4 walk straight to Hoehyeon intersection to get to Namsan Oreumi Theres also a lot of eateries there One can buy food and sit at a common sitting area where one can dine and enjoy the beautiful skyline at the same time It can get crowded with tourist and its popular amongst locals too
1353,3,My favourite part of the tower was the walk up there through the park it is a beautiful park to escape the hustle of Seoul I suggest if you are fit enough just to walk up to the top it takes a while but is worth it The tower itself is nice but nothing amazing unfortunately Seoul doesnt have a great skyline so the view from the top isnt outstanding Some really nice cafes and restaurants are at the bottom of the tower good place for a cheap meal Sure it is nice and still a decent view but it wont blow you away
1354,4,Pro  High observatory overlooking the whole of Seoul and beyond Includes the Alive 3D visual museum and the Teddy bear museum downstairs Romantic place Even saw a marriage proposal Declare your love with locks love notes wall notes or wishing well Send a postcard from the little post box up there Beautiful at night Night scenes are awesome SnacksFood available Great place to chill  Con  Fee to take the tram up Fee to go up the observatory Fee to go to the other attractions Quite crowded on the tram  lift Touristy Prepare to spend a lot on souvenirs  trinkets Lots of walking  hiking required if you want to skip the tram or taxi going up
1355,3,It is always beautiful at N Seoul Tower with good views of Seoul and Namsan is quite central in position Of course Seoul is huge so you can possibly see the whole of Seoul Now about practical aspects there are four ways to Namsan Cable Car station  by taxi bus walk hike or lift from below The lift is the cheapest and most convenient but the lift entrance is quite inconspicuous others should be able to lead you to it if you ask its right by the Namsan tunnel Since the cable car is quite slow expect a very long queue particularly at night time or weekends They will shut the ticket office and reopen when the queue is shorter Then the taxi drivers  NOT all will use the meter so be careful They will charge you 20k30k won for a relatively short time to the city centre and they have all colluded City officials shouldnt have let this happen but hey what rights do tourists have anyway  So take the lift down and catch a taxi from there  youll save loads trust me
1356,4,Great place to visit You can go up their by either cable car walking biking or by bus Nice view of the city Great restaurant there
1357,5,Been there during winter the view is breathtaking The mountain is covered with white fluffy snow Nice cable car ride to the top It is freezing cold but we did enjoy our visit there
1358,4,Today I visited the N Seoul Tower I took the Seoul City Tour Bus daily ticket for 12000 won which is about 12 One of its stops is the tower Bought a ticket for observatory deck which normally cost 9000 won but due to my ticket of tour bus received a  10 discount Just before you enter the elevator they will take your picture which Will be ready by the time you reach the top but you are not required to by it The view on top is very good which is worth the money The only claim I have is that the windows from outside were little bit dirty causing the pictures you take not perfect clear There is also a souvenier shop 
1359,2,The N Seoul tower is expensive for nothing The view is not that great compare to other city views You definitely should go down the tower at the top of the hill you will have a same view that the tower for free
1360,4,This was our second time to Seoul so we took the express train from the Incheon airport to Seoul Tower which took about 45 minutes to get there We then spent 3 USD on a taxi to the gate of the park and then another 1 to take the public bus up the windy hill to the top of the observatory area where all the amenities were I am a runner and have completed 8 half marathons and even myself and husband chose to take the bus The hike is all uphill and windy so I recommend you get transportation to get to the top where all the shops food and view is  Once we got there the views were panoramic we could see mountains water and a 360 degree view of the city skyline Breathtaking There was also something really special that was new to the tower the last 2 years or so They had locks for purchase and you can lock it to the fence or metal tree and throw away the key The love lock you get to write a personal message about someone you love as well so my husband and I bought a 9 USD lock and wrote our messages to one another on each side and placed it on the fence with the other thousand or so locks that begun to pile up We spent about 2 hours here and it was a great way to spend time and was relatively inexpensive
1361,5,What a great attraction and such a romantic story The views of the city are great and the symbolism of attaching a lock with the couples names on its to the rails is so beautiful We werent sure if you were supposed to keep the keys are not I think you thrown then so your love can never be unlocked  See many other locks of love around the world such as in Cologne Rome Prague Donestk and Paris  wwwmskotravelscom
1362,4,This is an excellent place to get the Panoramic pic of Seoul for your photo collection We went just before sunset so we could experience both day and night and it is worth the effort and time There are a couple of cafes to quench your thirst and have a bite The whole experience starts with the small railway car that takes you to the cable car that takes you to the tower It is busy but it wasnt overly crowded
1363,3,It is part of the must visit attraction for seoul At one of the highest point near the city Been there twice nothing much actually If you ask me if I will go for a third time the answer is no
1364,3,I went there at around 56 pm in summer so the sky was still bright I guess coming here at night would be much better but I wanted to walk in Nansam Park to get to N Seoul Tower so I have to do that when there were still light in the sky  I have been to Tokyo tower and the tower in Shanghai I am not a big fan of these towers but I feel bad not visiting them as they are seen as such a big attraction To me all three of these towers feel the same The view isnt that spectacular either just a typical city view So I guess it is worth going if you enjoy the tower view otherwise I think it is ok just to take photos from the outside without going to the observatory deck
1365,5,We take the cable car route  still require considerable length of walking  View from the tower is fantastic  Try the toilet on top  the most beautiful view  toilet in the world  Well organized  very nice and clean  Nice coffee and restaurants 
1366,1,I just visited the tower and I did not like it at all The whole view is pretty but it took forever for us to get up to the tower We arrived at the cable cart ride at 7pm and as it is summer there was still some light There was a loooong queue to get on the cable Note no plural thats right for a technological advance country that is hugely populated with both citizens and tourist the cable cart ride only has 1 ONE cable cart to take you up to the tower and another one back down it The posters or pictures of the cable cart is so misleading Theres only a total of 2 cable carts for a group of 2025 sardines opps i mean people swashed in Seriously what was Korea thinking when they designed it So we queued to purchase tickets and then queued again for the cable cart Once when we finally reached to the top it was 9pm Thats right 9pm a whole 2 hours of queueing Then we bloody had to queue again to purchase tickets to go up the tower which took another half an hour We got our tickets at 930pm and was told that all the resturants were closed so no food was available There goes our dinner We had to eat in a cafe A Twosome place cafe muffins and scones Not what we wanted especially since we wanted to eat at the dinner at the Ngrill All other food shops were closing and only drinks were available So we only purchased the observatory deck tickets which AGAIN we had to wait 50min to get on the elvator and up the tower So just over 10 pm we were up the tower for only 2030 min and only to queue again to go back down onto the cable cart then we caught a taxi to take us back to our hotel for room service dinner at 12pm  So all i can say that the N Seoul Tower was not worth the long queue and wait Be prepared to wait as there is a long queue We went on a Saturday night so I guess that makes the queue even longer
1367,3,N tower is a mustvisit place if first time visit to Seoul The overview is great Several ways of approaching on foot taxi bus from several places However food in tower is not so impressive It is better to visit nearby restaurants in Hannamdong Itaewon Namdaemun
1368,3,We arrived at the tower at about 600pm We queued to get tickets which actually only took about 5 minutes There was a huge queue outside but one of the ushers told us to buy the tickets inside We then had to wait for an hour before we could queue for the lift we were warned of this when we bought the tickets This part was a complete shambles There were 100s of people milling around not really sure what to do with themselves There was no where to sit and no one wanted to miss their turn  We then queued for the lift which probably took about 30 mins and then we were at the top I wasnt hugely impressed with the view I wish I would have gone in the day time as I think the view would have been better We then had to queue for ages again to the get the lift back down There was then a huge queue to get a bus back out so we just walked back to the Hyatt It probably took us about 40 minutes  I have been to Taipei 101 and the Tokyo Sky Tree and this does not compare to these two
1369,4,The walk up the N Seoul Tower and the views are extraordinary It gives you a true sense of the vast size of Seoul in a way that nowhere else can give The walk up is quite strenuous if you are not in good shape and can take anywhere from 30min to 90 if you need to stop a lot most people I think take 4550 There is also a cable car up but we did not take it The tower is best to visit in early evening so you can see the sun set over the great city of Seoul and then see the city lit up at night The crowds are quite heavy and if you want to go up get tickets in advance make restaurant reservations or get there early and be prepared to sit for a while until your time comes There is a nice gift shop as well where you can buy a lock write on it and attach it to the wall or trees which are to signal your eternal love  If you are physically able to make it either via cable car or walk I dont think you can come to Seoul and not experience N Tower
1370,5,The cable car ride is a must as the entire metropolis could be seen Upon entering the park there are so many photo opportunities as well as amazing views of the city I recommend going straight up to the very top of the tower as there is a 360 degree view of the entire city of Seoul This costs extra though The weather was great on the day I visited so I thoroughly enjoyed this experience This is a mustseedo when visiting Seoul
1371,4,We headed here at night to check out the lights of Seoul  and it didnt disappoint Its a pretty cool attraction granted there isnt much to do here the time we went  early Jan but the view is nice  The cable car ride up is fun and the elevator up to the viewing platform is well thought of  the graphics and concept is a great idea  There are a few restaurants and cafes around with a neat little souvenir shop  be sure to purchase a tile and be part of the tile wall Also  buy a padlock and join the hundreds of others to lock your love on the gate surrounding the building  The snow covered city below was an awesome sight even though it was bitterly cold outside when we were there  it was completely worth it  Definitely worth checking out if youre in Seoul
1372,3,Lots of people there not recommended for those whom are seeking a serene places to enjoy the capital view and relax Best timing to visit is just before sunset so you are able to see different views of Seoul during day and night
1373,5,Be prepared to take a nice hike up to the base of the tower The walk is long and some parts are steep Walking shoes is a must and water But the walk is beautiful as it is inside a park with lovely gardens There is a gondola or tram type ride you can take towards the top if you want to skip some of the steep steps The tram ride is fun and also a great view Worth the walk and worth the incredible views at the top of the tower
1374,5,If can please come early if you want to visit the Alive museum Alive museum have 2section please visit section 1 then only section 2 Different entrance The observatory desk is close quite early The lock place as well If u want something special buy ur own lock if u want to lock it here Else the lock here is nothing special n expensive Some romantic thing can b done here Best for couple
1375,3,We reached N Seoul Tower by cable car which happened to be the most exciting part of the visit to the top Its definitely not the bestcoolest tower Ive been too as CN Tower Toronto CAN still ranks in my top 3 I describe it more as a short tower on a big hill As well we couldnt see jack from the view as it was extremely hazy  There were plenty of activities on the plaza as it was kind of touristy As we were about to leave the first time they started setting up for a martial show which turned out to be pretty cool Other than that I was ready go Not much to see overcrowded and hazy  If youre in Seoul I do recommend you check out the tower Its kind of like Hollywood you got to see it once Maybe youll have better luckviewing than we did Cheers
1376,5,Its very romantic for couples there and its has a great view of the city and its a symbol of Korea But access by taxi and car is prohibited so you can only walk take buses or cable car from myeongdong stationBy bus you can take a yellow bus at Chungmuro station or at Dongguk University station when you see the parking lot of N Seoul Tower then alight Its really great to go there as its so beautiful especially at night
1377,4,From Myeongdong you can get here by bus It is also much cheaper compared to riding the cable car The view is fantastic No need to get to the top of the tower since the view at the bottom of N Seoul Tower is ok already Dont forget to check out the namsan locks of love also
1378,2,Apart being going to the top by cable car not really intrestinga view of buildingscity landscape full of crowd and you can hardly find a seat to sitdont expwct much
1379,4,Go at night to see the lights The view in the daytime is just not the same And go on a weeknight because the weekends are very busy and the waits are long At the top you can buy postcards with postage request an extra stamp for delivery to the US and mail them from the tower My boys enjoyed writing postcards to their friends We had just missed some sort of ceremony that we didnt know about  perhaps its worth looking into the schedule That might be a reason to go during the day
1380,4,Had a chance to visit the tower on my first trip to Seoul and really enjoyed the view If you get a chance to visit via tram you can also leave a lock of love when you get there
1381,3,We went one evening when it was drizzling Because of that we did not see the sunset The wind was very strong so it was pretty cold We did not stay outside to enjoy the view for too long as it was just too cold I guess it may be romantic if you visit with your other half and on a clear evening so that you can enjoy the sunset Check the weather before you go We took the cable car up but I would imagine walking down the mountain will be nice on a fine day
1382,5,This is an excellent place to go Gorgeous view of Seoul and nice place to spend some time and have a cup of coffee The negative point is the long line to get the cable car to go up to the tower However it moved quite decently so waiting time was less than 1h Climbing to the tower was quick and easy
1383,4,This was a really nice place to visit However the queue for the cable cars took about an hour although this is expected but there are coffee shops etc along the wait so you can by some food or take a rest when you get to the top the view of the whole city is very very nice There is also a padlock corner where you can write stuff and pad lock it to the bars and take pictures etc The top is almost like a park where you can relax I think I saw people having picnics too which is a good idea You can also buy food up there I didnt purchase anything so cant comment on the price I also only ventured outside But it is well worth the visit The only downside is it was a bit difficult to find
1384,3,I went there at night not much of the visibility but the tower itself was beautiful not too special about the view as I came from Hong Kong and lots of other places have much better night view than Seoul but Seoul has her charms If you like Seoul you must come to the tower to take a look
1385,5,I would strongly recommend the N Seoul Tower if you are in Seoul for a visit Best place to see the whole city  We dine at one their cheap restaurant before go up the Tower Food is nice and reasonable  We bought combined museum and n Seoul tower ticket We love the museum as well
1386,5,Loved N Seoul Tower You get great views of Seoul and the tram is very efficient We visited during the evening and there were terrific views
1387,4,We visit this place at night Awesome light up of the n Seoul tower and Seoul city The view from top is simply too amazing that no words can describe There are lots of love locks aroundu can lock yours too Good place for couples
1388,2,We went on a Monday nightfollowed a blog entry directions and got lost insteadwe walked up a super super duper long slope and climbed stairs to finally reached the cable car station By right the directions should be While facing Pacific Hotel and still on the main road turn your body to the right and walk straight all the way on the main road with no slopes at all for about 10 mins till you see a tall building with Woori Bank as seen in my picture then turn left onto a slope While walking about at most 5 mins on the slope you should see an elevator take it and voila you will reach the cable car station easily  Cable car round trip tix  8500 won It is only about 5 mins ride up but you have to queue as the cable car staffs will wait for more people before starting the ride  You will then have to climb a flight of stairs up to the foot of N Seoul Tower  N Seoul Tower admission 9000 won each you can also take a picture when you first enter the N Seoul Tower and buy it at 15k for two pictures  Night view of Seoul is nice but not really that magnificent The view is also kinda disappointing with the poorly maintained glass which you either see fingerprints or be distracted by the many lights behind you due to the souvenirs shop I think it is such a letdown They should just have a space for an observatory deck and have the souvenirs shop somewhere else  Nevertheless a tower at each country is my mustgo However N Seoul Tower is not one of the best tower i have gone to  Anyway go if you love having a bird eye view of the city The admission is also considered quite cheap
1389,5,We walked up at night after not being able to find the cable car but was very glad we did Seeing the view as we walked up was lovely and the walk made the top more worthwhile The tower was reasonably priced very touristy but worth it for the view Would love to see the view again in daylight although view at night was amazing
1390,4,this is where u want to get the best view of Seouland theres this padlocks of love tied to each otherso so many surrounding the tower  we even went to the trick eye museum at the Tower and had a great time there  we took the bus service from the Myeongdong subway station and its way2 cheaper than the cable car
1391,5,The tower itself looks amazing its actually not that tall in comparison to similar observation towers however its situated on a perfect spot on top of the mountain overlooking the city We visited at night time and the views were indeed spectacular even the cable car ride up to the tower was great Note that you have to get separate tickets to ride the cable car then to access the tower itself Once at the top the view is already amazing from several lookout points and it was really entertaining to see the projected videosshows onto the tower There are what appear to be millions of love padlocks chained to the surrounding fences and the theme continues with romantic benches and statues; so Id imagine it would be a very cool place to visit with a partner There are a few nice cafes and even a teddy bear museum afraid we didnt visit to name a few of the additional things you can get up to not to mention the entire surrounding area is gorgeous especially lit up in the evening  definitely worth a visit
1392,4,Just got back from N Seoul Tower went via cable car with is very crowded They just try to fit as many people as they can in it Very cold this time of the year We added our own lock which was nice I remember bring your own as they are quite expensive from the shop I enjoyed the burger shop As for the tower itself its a nice very but if youve been to other towers around the world its wont be too different
1393,3,Forgot to check weather forecast Walked all the way from Myeongdong to the cable car station after travel to the top Being informed that it is a cloudy day So if really go up the Tower also might not be able to see much Another disappointment is the Teddy Bear Museum is closed during winter TT  Tips remember to bring a marker and padlock for leaving the padlock there with your love wishes 
1394,3,It was a tower what can I say It was crowded with tourists taking photos The experience was a bit overrated They do have a teddy bear museum there which would make that trip worth it Overall its an okay experience
1395,4,I went to the tower in Feb 2013 and it was still freezing during that period 1st of all therere few ways to go up to where the tower is located either by cable car bus or car Do check in advance as sometimes road closure do take place so you might have to climb up the steep hill where the tower is located and its still about 2030 mins hike The view on top is beautiful Do take note that there are limited timing daily for the purchasing of tickets up to the observatory deck of the tower so you must decide your timing properly before hand Recommended to go up during the night time and youll see the beautiful landscape and lightings of Seoul
1396,5,It has a great night view where we can see whole the Seoul and the cablecar is really interesting to take I strongly recommend this place
1397,5,My mothers favorite place in Seoul Here you can see the city from a birds eye view Breathtaking and romantic especially during Autumn I recommend visiting in the late afternoon to watch the lovely sunset A must
1398,4,We heard alot about this landmarkattraction so we decided to take a hike up From PJ hotel we could see the Seoul Tower out of our window It was ard 1520 mins walk from the hotel to the cable car station at namsan park There was quite a queue up so we decided to climb the stairs Good thing we did because the sun was setting and the view was beautiful There were more people descending the steps than ascending There were also a few rest points along the way where you can take very nice pictures  We didnt go all the way up the seoul tower but we did visit the area where you can find a myriad of colorful locks wishes and love shaped benches It was quite a view especially during the sunset There are also cafes but was a little crowded I would strongly recommend for tourists to take a slow walk up and enjoy the view along the way
1399,4,I visited this place on last Sunday and it was very nice The view from the top of tower is amazing Anyone visiting Korea should visit this palace To go there you can take subway You should get down at Myeongdong station From exit 10 take a left and go to the namsan cable car station It is at 10 mint walkable distance From there you can take cable car to go to the tower baseReturn ticket for cable car is 8500 KRW About Tower  If you are visiting this tower you should take out at least 23 hours of your busy scheduleAlso visit this place during sunset so that you can enjoy Seoul view both in daylight and during night Entry fee for Observatory is 900 KRW Following things you must do  Go to Observatory find your country location and take a picture  If you are travelling with your kids then you should visit Teddy Bear Museum  Check timing of light shows It is i guess at 8pm and 9pm You should attend this  Enjoy the romantic base of the tower  To Eat   There is some food available at the base of the tower as well as on Observatory I feel food was very bad and costly But few people liked it  Best thing try something at Myeongdong station It is famous for food
1400,3,I went here with my 3 yrs old daughterthe way is steepi need to push the stroller up thereso damn tiredbut the view was awesomei love the escalator up to towersuper fastbut one againit was very difficult to bring stroller herei had to carry the stroller down
1401,3,Steep slope lots of mainlanders noisy had to queue super long to enter the observatory deck Female staff at the photo booth was rude However lift attendant were friendly Must go Teddy bear museum and do buy the 2 in 1 package as it is worth it
1402,4,What can I say You have to go here whether you like it or not You cant go to Paris and not see the Eiffel Tower The Seoul tower isnt too special but we did tie a love lick up there so lets see how that goes
1403,4,Its just an amazing 360 degree view of the entire city marvellous place to visit especially in the evening time
1404,5,It was a spectaculer view when view the city from the top of the Tower also the Love Lock its so unique and creative idea to attrack the tourist
1405,4,I chose the walking route to get to the top of this tower The other option is the cable cars which I did not experience  It took around half an hour to walk to the top from the taxicoach dropoff point and there are various stopoff points along the way where you can enjoy the view  At the top are various cafes and places where you can buy padlocks and plastic to write on You will realise why when you get to the viewing area  The location is very popular with couples who write love messagesletters on their padlocks backs of phones or anything they can find really and chain them to a fence of alreadyfilled love messages
1406,1,To avoid absolutely on weekend The waiting time is very long at each step At the top you get the feeling that everything is done to get a bit more money from you Even the view is not that great due to the windows being dirty The noise at the top is terrible and prevent you from enjoying anything
1407,4,Just few steps from the cable car This place is definitely for romantics what with locks and customized benches Its a must visit when in Seoul
1408,4,a bit disappointed as it was raining and drizzling when we went hence decided to just walk around the area and not heading up to the observation deck itself I love the padlock areait was so nice But wld be nice to head there as a couple to lock your padlock up and write your wishes About heading over to the place N seoul is located up a hilleven tour grp need to drop off at the coach parking area and everyone just need to walk upslope yourself
1409,5,It takes about 4 hours to tour around n seoul tower inside and outsideif you like to snap sunset view and night scene suggest you to go up the tower at around 3pm then you are able to cover everything including the sunset; the night scene of seoul city;  the night performance outside nseoul tower at 8pm sharp
1410,3,Actually theres nothing much to say about N Seoul Tower itself When we were there the observatory was too crowded barely enough space for you to have a view from the top Restaurants are expensive and even the souvenirs But what we enjoyed more is the area where people leave locks spreading messages of love especially couples feeling so romantic Youll see them seated in benches whispering sweet nothings to each other It was cold and windy that night in September 2013 Really a good time for couples in love Another attraction we visited was the Teddy Bear Museum It was awesome seeing them in all sizes in different costumes various themes and some in action You really would spend time taking photos not only of these cute bears but photos with them It was fun When we were about to leave there was this light show of the tower itself So we watched it and enjoyed it although it wasnt extra ordinary But as a whole the experience was good
1411,4,Ive been to Seoul tower late March this year and its been one of my memorable experiences in Korea When visiting the tower i prefer you visit it in the evening where the tower is lighted with different colors The view is breath taking seeing the whole City shining a romantic sight indeed And it is extra cold out there since the elevation of the tower is very high Dont forget to bring padlock or you can just buy it in the tower Couples and friends locked the padlock with the belief that they too will be locked up with each other There is no problem with the transportation since there is a regular route of bus
1412,4,If you want to get the best view of the city go to Namsan park and go up the tower It doesnt matter what time of day it is; it just depends whether you prefer an early morning climb or dusk For me i love the sunset views from here and the changing colors of duskvery romantic
1413,5,When youre up there you can see the whole city of Seoul and it feels great The weather is cool and its really foggy when we got there so the view of the city is covered most of the time One thing youve got to be prepared of is walking uphill for about 15mins From the entrance near the theather you need to walk at least 15mins also uphill to catch the bus and then it will drop you off somewhere near the tower and another 15mins walking Once you get to the base of the tower there are lots of food outlets and souvenir shops We tried the burger at the best burger in seoul and its simply delicious No fuss just great fresh sandwhiches Teddy bear museum is at the basement We didnt visit the observatory coz its really foggy I find the love locks romantic and cute but too cheesy for us
1414,5,Must visit during night for bright view of the city from the tower It is very prominent and can be reached easily
1415,4,The N Seoul Tower was quite enjoyable the fee wasnt too expensive Its hard to recommend going at day or night because at day you can see the locks of love etc more clearly however at night the view from the tower is more breathtaking Id recommend going at both times if convenient or in the afternoon and staying until it goes dark Because that is where the beauty begins I dont know if it was frequent however when we got to the base of the tower there was a lovely show going after the top of the towerprojected electronically from a screen which was loud but nonetheless nice There are plenty of souvenir shops and right about there you get your tour packages You can go to the Teddy Bear Museum etc However the Teddy Bear Museum did get quite tedious I recommend going if youre really interested in cultural history or if youre with children The view from the tower really is the best though
1416,5,As a collection of towers that visited as we travelled Especially like the spectacular of whole of seoul Convenient city shuttle tour bus took us all the way up the hill
1417,5,I had 10 hours in Seoul between flights and it was my goal to get to the top of this tower I took the airtrain in to town and then walked an hour or so form the train terminal to the base You buy tickets and take a cool elevator to the top The view of the city and towards North Korea is pretty interesting  I was soooo glad I made the effort
1418,5,Definitley worth a visit for any visitor to Seoul You get to go up to the top and stay as long as you want You can buy tickets up front that give you a discount on snacks at the top
1419,5,Great view I went during the night and was awesome Great laser show as well Well Worth it Buy the NANTA ticket and get in for free Well Worth it 
1420,5,We reached N Seoul by taking the hop on hop off city tour bus It was spring in March so it was not exhausting at all but a good exercise climbing up to the tower from where the bus dropped us off The view of Seoul from the top was awesome The place so picture perfect  from the love seat to the love padlocks to the tower My friends and i were so lucky to catch a show of the royal guards It was a great experience The place itself brings warmth and serenity  definitely a place for family friends lovers adults and young kids Visiting N Seoul is a worthwhile and enjoyable experience
1421,3,namsan tower is just another tower that you see the overview of seoul tower we took the cable car up and it wasnt a good experience cause the staff tends to squeeze and max the capacity thus it was warm throughout the trip up and cant really enjoy the view up there you can enjoy 360deg of seoul city and visit the souvenir store as well visit if you have spare time or for the sake of visiting
1422,3,It is like the Statue of Liberty if you visit Seoul you have to visit N Seoul tower but you probably will not go there again The view is good but not breathe taking; and you have go in the right weather The Teddy bear museum is not worthy visiting; however if you actually go to N Seoul tower you probably are a foreigner visiting Seoul for the first time; in this case you should see the museum to make your time and money spent on the flight worthy If you have time and the weather allows Id recommend walking around the Park as well as taking the cable car Cable car will take you down to somewhere very close to Myeong Dong which is another mustgo in Seoul
1423,3,The novelty of visiting what is probably the most famous landmark in Korea is the most exciting part of it really You cant go to the highest point of the tower and the area that you are allowed into is a cylinder of souvenir shops Granted the views of Seoul are pretty nice if you can find a time when the weather is clear and the pollution isnt covering the city It may have been a little more enjoyable if not for the pretty substantial crowds but thats to be expected at such a wellknown attraction  The rotating restaurant was really overpriced but the burger place was pretty delicious Unfortunately its really not very easy to find a vegetarian option there  Take the cable car ride it was an experience itself Be prepared to have absolutely no personal space in there though
1424,5,Come here in the afternoon just before the sunset the views are amazing and the city comes to life Watch out if the weather is bad you cannot see that much also on Sunday most offices are closed so the city is not as lit up with the buildings as during the week Its considered to be a romantic spot so you will see a lot of locals having a romantic stroll around the tower There are also a lot of restaurants around so you can have a diner and watch the city Two ways getting there a cablecart ride which takes about 45 minutes or a walk up which many locals prefer as its free and healthier rather then the cablecart Just after sunset on Sunday while I was there there was a sound and light show on the tower wall which was kind of fun Highly recommended place and there is a Teddy Bear Museum somewhere close to the tower I did not have the time to look for it but I bet its fun as the tower
1425,4,Beautiful view of the city of Seoul Recommended to go at night when the sky is dark and the city lights are up
1426,4,Seoul tower has great views that give you fantastic panoramas right into North Korea also However after being up many observation towers around the world they all just seem to be the same these days However at 9 Australian dollars to go up it is by far the best valued price to pay  Stay clear of the gift shops like all of these observation towers; full of cheap and over priced junk
1427,4,Locks left by lovers hoping to lock their relationship forever filled the railings of N Seoul Tower Beautiful sight with benches that are bended in the middle Great place for photo taking We took the cable car up and visited the teddy bear museum inside as well Very cute and informative about the history of Korea during the Joseon and Silla era We were there during Summer and Korea kind of conserves energy a lot so the place is rather stuffy without much air condition and its really hot and humid Try to go when it isnt that cloudy We went all the way up but it was too cloudy to have a good view of the entire city Beautiful nonetheless 
1428,4,The two main attractions at N Seoul Tower are the Observatory and the Teddy Bear Museum Since were not a fan of teddy bears we only opted for the Observatory tickets  Entrance to the Observatory costs KRM9000 RM2571 per adult while the Teddy Bear Museum costs KRW8000 RM2286 Visitors who plan to visit both attractions will get a discounted package price  More on blog post httpwwwkenwooicom201307nseoultowerhtml
1429,4,We spent the better part of the day at the NSeoul Tower and we really enjoyed ourselves If you go to the website you may be hesitant to use public transportation getting there but its a must Privately owned cars are not allowed to enter the area and if you really want to park at the very bottom of this hill and hike it up good luck The public bus will drop you off at the upper parking lot leaving about 1412 mile walk up to the tower Be warned this walk is not for the faint of heart you will definitely earn it  its a steep one Once you reach the top there two ways you can go about the view; 1 pay the full price go inside the tower and ride the elevator to the top Here you will enjoy views from the very top of the tower a few gift shops and easy access to several of the restaurants 2 you can save your money about 37000 won for the five of us and walk around the terrace and take a good look out at Seoul You already on top of a mountain and you can see all the way out to the horizon Having said that we paid Weve taken on this if we are going we are going all the way mentality and thats just what we do We ate at the burger joint at the base of the tower very reasonably priced a good burger but not the best in Seoul not even close The Cold Stone Creamery at the base of the tower was a welcomed surprise as the day was very warm The cultural dancing outside on the grounds the variety of restaurants and the ceiling in the elevator were all pros The grounds surrounding the tower are beautiful So on the cheap bring your own picnic  there are several areas to sit and enjoy walk around the tower and enjoy the view and take in as many of the cultural dancingsinging exhibits as providedtotal cost to you would be 0 won If youre in it to win it buy the tickets eat at the local restaurant top it off with some Cold Stone Creamery and hit a couple stores on the way out Either way you will enjoy the trip we did Couple tips  the 3 bus in Seoul will take you right up to the parking lot area The wait for the elevator down will probably be 3 times longer than the wait going up We ordered several items at the burger joint with a couple requests ie no pickles no onion hot dog plain The fella taking the order said no problem but when we received the food it came out exactly the way it was on the menu Give yourself 23 hours to take your time and enjoy
1430,5,Before the NSeoul Tower is a glass lift Was a big queue ropeway A round trip ticket to Cable Car costs 16000 KRW You can also visit the Teddy Bear Museum and the observation deck Behind two excursions 14000 KRW
1431,3,Its great fun getting there by the Cable Car and the base station itself has fantastic views over Seoul I just found the very top of the tower a little disappointing The views are no better from up there although there is a novelty value to looking out from the bathroom and the shopping  snack bars are low quality
1432,3,N Tower can be reached through a short cable car ride It gives an overview of seoul city with its myriad of lights The place is nice where walls are filled by lovers lock in all sizes
1433,3,Its a bit pricy to get up top and you have to buy tickets for the cable cart and then for the elevator to get atop the tower one at the top the view of Seoul is nice however at night they dont dim the lights inside very much and the glare from the lights is very annoying but what you can see at night is very nice on the other hand the view from the base which is atop a small mountain is also beautiful at night and best of all no glass The entire location is based around love and romance so really I recommend couples to go here If its cloudy its not recommended to go atop the tower as the clouds often hit the top of the tower but not as much the base Of course winter is the best time to go as visibility from high places is always better in cold weather
1434,4,My family went here on early Saturday morningwe took taxi from Myeongdong that cost us 5 but once we get there the taxi is not allowed to enter the park so we took bus No5 to get up the tower and from there would have to walk 5 minutes to reach the towerWe pretty much see the Seoul area if you walk around so it saves us a bit to stay in the ground rather than paying fee to go up the towerThe lock of love area is fascinating though its quite vandalizedLove lock can be purchase for 8 including penthough you can hang any sort of stuff and write something on itFood can be purchase at restaurant and theres dining area outsidea must see area at Seoul
1435,4,I went to N Seoul Tower on Christmas night last year It was freezing cold but the giant christmas tree and the multimedia attraction was amazing It was very crowded with young couples but still very well arranged and neat This place was so good that I returned the next week this time was in day time and I was surprised to see the view of Seoul from the tower Overall the N Seoul Tower is simply amazing and a must visit for anyone who travels to Seoul
1436,5,This attraction is best at night During most of our stay in Seoul it was foggy during the day so we couldnt see very far At night the sky is clear and the city literally lights up The tower is definitely prettier and more majestic at night I would suggest buying and bringing your own lock from home They sell them at the tower but everyone seems to have the same one
1437,4,Liked The views are fantastic from the observation tower Take the elevator to the top There is also the N Grill restuarant on top which is a great place to eat since it revolves The dislike was that there was a very long wait to get to the observation tower and it was very crowded If you come at the wrong time you could be waiting up to one hour to get up and another one hour to get down
1438,5,I truly love the Namsan tower I have been there 3 times 1 on Winter 1 on Spring and 1 on summer I love how the scenery changes so distinctively during the 3 seasons but out of all 3 seasons I love Winter on the Namsan tower the most
1439,3,The queue to ride the elevator up the tower took long Wasnt very impressed with the view Then there was an even longer line to go down the tower Maybe my experience would have been better if it included the cable car
1440,4,The tower is easily accessible from the path to the left of Pacific hotel It was just a short walk up to the cable car boarding area The ride on the cable car was comfortable The grounds at the base of the tower is worth exploring There is a pavillion to rest tired legs and a fort of sorts with patrolling guards in costumes
1441,3,Info given to me said it closes at 11 pm I was there at 10pm and not allowed to go up the tower Walked around the base of it Went up and down on the cable car It wasnt easy getting transport from there
1442,4,Enjoyed our trip up here We went for sunset and it is a great spot to admire Seoul from Liked all the love theming and the padlocks around the viewing spots and the love seats are worth a look We ate at the restaurant at the top called Hankook and it was very good We werent paying though i Imagine it is very expensive
1443,4,By cable car or by bus you have to experience that 10minute uphill walk to appreciate the view of Seoul and the many padlocks left by couples and otherwise at the foot of the tower  the padlocks lined the rails and some are collected into treeshaped structures You can visit the place after the Namsangol Hanok Village the yellow bus number 2 or 3 outside the village in front of the Popeye Restaurant Pay 9000KRW to go by the elevator to the top of the tower I think the scenery would be more beautiful in the fall when the leaves turn yelloworange
1444,4,The view from the base of the tower was refreshing and breezy The fee to ascend to the top of the tower was expensive
1445,5,Fun if weather is good Beautiful at night Not a must see if you flew into Seoul at night but see if you can
1446,4,N Seoul Tower is not world renowned or famous for its height The special quality of N Seoul Tower is the location within Namsan park in central Seoul The view is fantastic but instead of only visiting for the view from the observation deck instead enjoy a drink or a meal at the restaurant near the top  The atmosphere is pleasant and having a enjoyable conversation with a glass of wine is vastly more ideal than quickly snapping some pictures The area can be crowded on the weekends so plan accordingly
1447,1,Payed to go up the seoul tower wife one tear old baby with stroller Went up the the cable car only to discover that I need to go up 50 stairs Had to go back down Fought for our money
1448,3,If you have time I recommend visiting the Seoul Tower otherwise skip it It was a complete tourist trap We took the tram It was pricey crowded and there wasnt much to see
1449,3,During my first visit I was running around like crazy What a pretty tower What a pretty park I bought a lot of souvenirs and took so many pictures  I was really amazed Unfortunately I arrived too close to last admission at the Teddy Bear Museum so I told myself to come back  I went back ten months later and noticed some things  1 When its too cold its not as fun Part of the fun is marveling at the park surrounding the tower and the lights that paint the tower walls When its 2 degrees Celsius its hard to stand outside to enjoy the mountain air or check out the lovers locks on the fences Once you leave the warmth of the buildings all you want to do is hide in another warm place Cold night  misery  2 There arent that many food choices Theres a fancy dinner place a burger place and the al fresco dining place I dont know why I thought we could have dinner there If youre not into pastas and burgers you could have a problem We went to the burger place and the food was soso The fries were good and they sold pink lemonade so it wasnt a total loss Still we would have been better off eating before we went up  3 I need to warn you about taking the cable car when its cold The best way to leave the cable car station at the base on Mt Namsan is to walk to the NamdaemunMyeongdong area We couldnt do this in the cold and decided to take a cab instead The cab driver that was available asked us to pay USD 20 for a three minute ride Dont ever go for this Cab drivers in Seoul are generally honest so this was an exception but it could happen to you too so please be careful  Now that Ive seen the Teddy Bear Museum I think this last time was it for me No need to go back Twice is just right  but if you actually get to see the Teddy Bear Museum the first time once might be enough too
1450,3,There was a fog yesterday night spoiling the night view Could be amazing  Cable car cost 8000 won and another 9000 won to head up to Tower Better off googling it maybe
1451,4,This tower is one of the drop point of the Seoul City Tour Bus and also few bus routes Alternatively you can walk from the nearest subway; ie Myeongdong From the bus stand allowed 1020 minutes to walk uphill  If youre coming by the Seoul City Tour Bus make use of the coupon given when purchased the ticket in order to get cheaper entrance tickets  The scenery is beautiful but towards night the place is bit crowdy with tourists and lovers
1452,4,Beautiful scenery and it is a must go landmark if you go to Seoul For lover there is a place for both of you to lock your love at there
1453,3,lots of walking and the road is steep buts the place is beautiful and teddy bear museum is there so its fine
1454,5,Great views here Walking up Namsan Hill may take quite a bit of effort So its recommended to take bus no 3 Taxi cant bring you up Namsan Look out for bus no 3 from Seoul station You can use your Tmoney for the bus to tap on when you board and tap off when alighting Very convenient The bus will stop you right on Namsan hill where you can get a ticket for 2 foreigners get 20 discount at 18000 won nett to go up the observatory The elevator up the observatory is very interesting took us only 25 secs Bring along a lock and a mini message board to be attached to the lock if you are there as couple You can secure the lock at the viewing platform Great views at night
1455,3,We visited on a clear sunshine day last week My son enjoyed Its Okay I dont say it is a must visit you get almost the same view at the bottom Only thing is you are in little higher elevation We went in the city tour they dropped us at the bottom of the tower All most all the visitors goes up to take photos unfortunately windows of the observatory desk are not cleaned it obstruct you of the clear view Okay for a visit if you havent been in a tower but I dont rate it as a must
1456,4,Last March 24 Sunday my family took the yellow bus using TMoney cards to go to N Seoul Tower Cool weather in N Seoul Tower It was quite a steep walk from the bus station to the tower But the kids enjoyed it  We bought tickets to Teddy Bear Museum inside N Seoul Tower We all loved taking pictures of the cute teddy bears Some bears were in motion and following the music There were also some huge teddy bears  We enjoyed the food at the Cafe near the souvenir shop  My husband and I brought our love locks padlocks and attached it to the wall in N Seoul Tower   Around 3pm we watched a martial arts cultural musical show at the N Seoul Tower grounds Free admission
1457,4,If you want to visit the Seoul Tower i suggest it is best to do it at night the views are amazing with all the lights The tower also lights up at night  IMO the Seoul Tower is very plain and dull during the day
1458,4,Nice place to go and spend time Even if you dont go inside the Seoul tower you can still have a good view of Seoul Definitely a must visit at night to witness the light show
1459,4,We heard that the lights at night were an amazing sight but we chose to go there after lunch to see the details of the city We had lunch first in Myeongdong then walked up going to the cable car The cable car ride costs KRW6000 for a oneway ticket and KRW8000 for a return ticket We purchased the one way ticket so we can experience the trail going down the mountain There was still a bit of a climb going up but there were areas that you can rest take pictures buy snacks and enjoy the view  A major todo in this site especially for couples is to leave a lock with a love message You can choose to leave the message in the fence or in metal trees There really is no rule on how to leave your message  we saw a lot of curious things attached to the fences such as cellphone cases lunchboxes keychains etc I already brought a used metal padlock from Manila but we needed to buy a permanent marker and chose a waterproof bagtag from the souvenir shop to write our message If you dont have a lock the souvenir shop sells different colored locks surely more expensive had you purchased it at your local hardware store  We bought the bundle package tickets to the Observatory and the Teddy Bear museum KRW14000adult The Teddy Bear museum was a cute way to learn about Seouls history and the Observatory gives you probably the best panoramic view of Seoul Near the ticketing area theres a traditional Korea martial arts demonstration that happens every 3pm Quite cool to watch  Going down was a very light hike This was the same trail youd take if you will not take the cable car but judging from the facial expressions of those going up they looked very exhausted halfway up  The whole experience took about 4 hours to complete but Id think some people would probably take much longer if they will choose to eat in the restaurant there
1460,4,We visited it at night and enjoyed the fantastic view and charming lights of Seoul We also enjoyed the beautiful show outside the tower it was very creative thing I recommend visiting N Tour
1461,4,Best time I would recommend would be heading up there around 7 pm on a weekday so you could watch the tower light display at night Make a wish and purchase a love lock and have a forever imprint in Seoul by attaching to one of the many love trees It was just a bit crowded and getting in took forever but couldve been shorter as there wasnt enough a huge space inside Although its postal service did suffice for that shortcoming You could write yourself a postcard and send it from there ; pretty cool For 14000 won you could get a package of both tower and teddy bear museum
1462,4,Never regretted going to this tower See Seoul at literally different level The best time to go is during afternoon time 5  6pm to view the day scenery and chill out at the cafe or restaurant for awhile and be dazzle with the magnificent lighting of Seoul later at night If you long to vandalize the public wall bring along markers coz here in Namsam Tower youre free to express yourself Dont forget to bring any kind of padlock and lock your heart  soul with that special one as remembrance A really romantic getaway with that special one Take a cable car ride up here Its worth the price coz youll be amazed with the surrounding below Beautiful trees and flowers If you wanna go all the way even higher go on the tower viewing deck but theres price to it Quite expensive but when you come all the way here might as well go for it
1463,5,Seoul tower is great However with pollution that locals call fog  you honestly cant see much of the city I recommend going at night where you can see the city lights  BEWARE  there is a fairly steep little hike up to Seoul Tower and the locks If you have bad knees or ankles come prepared You can certainly do it  but no one tells you about the initial initiation into the Seoul Tower hiking club  You will need time here if you want to go up into the tower  but otherwise if youre using the hop on hop off bus  just use the 30 minutes between buses to get a quick view and move on
1464,5,Dont take the bus or taxi up Namsan Trek it and youll be happy you got the workout whilst also getting lovely views I recommend visiting in the late afternoon in spring while the Cherry Blossom trees are in bloom It is a sight to behold  Its also a nice romantic place to take your significant other to stroll and have a nice dinner Leave a lock of love if youre so inclined
1465,5,There are two common ways to go to N Seoul tower 1 by cable car you need to pay a little money for it but its fast 2 By your own foot just think it as a good chance to do some exercise D Or you could just take the taxi  In Seoul tower 1 The teddy bear museum is not really with large scale compared to other TB museum but it do have abundant of lovely Teddy bears 2 The night scape of Seoul is really wonderful but if you went there in summer like me you need to wait for sunset until 700 pm So dont go there too early if you only want to enjoy the night scape  About the ticket I bought combined ticketTB museum  observation floor and get a little discount
1466,5,This tower is very modern beautiful and the facilities are very good From the top you can view most of the part of Seoul Is good to go during the evening before gets dark So you can see the day and the night view there is also the lockers thing So if you go with your wifegirlfriend bring a locker and seal your love forever 
1467,4,View from the cable cars are amazingThis is the place that tourist should visit as it gives fantastic view of Seoul city from the observatory deck Love the Teddy Bear Museumit shows historic part of Korea using teddy bearsso creativelove peg lock trees
1468,4,i like the view of course and amazed with the speed of lift going up and down enjoyed the laser show outside in the mid of winter amazing i also like teddy bear museum and the souvenir shops
1469,4,The tower is at the base of Namsan one of the small mountains encircling the northern historical part of Seoul There is the cable car for the unfit or lazy and also a delightful walk up the hill On a good day when the carbon monoxide is not in play there must be tremendous views In any event the experience is well worth the cost of getting to the summit free for walkers but otherwise 8 for the return cable car ride  At the bottom of the hill there is Myeongdong for the shoppers and close by Namdaemun Market a maze of narrow shopping streets Best explored on foot  taxidriven tourists will gain nothing from the experience
1470,4,Nice way to spend an afternoon About as good of a view of the city as youre going to get  try to go on a day when there is less smog Ive heard that the view is better at night Very much a date location You can even order the couples package with popcorn and a soda Reasonably priced and easy to access via bus or cable car
1471,4,Loved the tinge of romance in the cold wintry air The whole idea of placing these love locks all around the N Seoul Tower as a pledge of eternal love is really WinterSonataish but worth doing if you wanna just enjoy what the locals do My wife and I bought the lovelocks and love them so much for their cutesyness that we brought them home and locked them against our doorgrills instead
1472,4,Catching the cable car up Namsan is something everyone seems to do when they visit Seoul Honestly the view from the base of the tower is just as good as that from the tower itself The film clips featuring the Namsan Love Bear however are worth the wait and queue to get to the top of the tower in themselves
1473,4,Good night scenic view of Seoul multiple affordable and somewhat average dining options There are many events at plaza so check their website to make more memorable
1474,4,This was cool  make sure you check for hazepollution before you go up though I made paid my way up there and realized I couldnt see much which was anticlimactic I enjoyed it nevertheless The lines were long though and it was FREEZING so if you are coming in the winter make sure you bundle up
1475,4,Our guide opted to schedule the climb to N Seoul Tower in the evening rather than its original morning scheduleAccording to her the view of the lighted city from the Tower would be more appealing to us It was drizzling when our coach arrived at the parking lot and our guide cautioned the elderly to just stay at the bus as it would be quite risky for them to join the group The inclined pathway to the Tower proved more difficult to hurdle because it got slippery because of the rains  The panoramic view of the city at the top of the Tower somehow compensated for the difficult climb My word of advice with or without the rains the 1015 minute walk uphill is definitely not recommended for the elderly
1476,5,A must visit in Seoul Amazing view from the observation decks There are also souvenir shops and restaurants in the tower Take take a cable car when going to top of Namsan mountain where the tower is located
1477,5,on their own simply because there are 80 very steep rocky steps between the namsam tower entrance and the place where the cabele car stops
1478,2,We walked instead of taking the cable car up Tiring If youre unfit The views were not too bad but all in all you get the feeling that its just a place to squeeze more money out of unsuspecting tourists I definitely wont come back here again
1479,4,going there at night and youll get a beautiful sights of seoul and the teddy bear museum is cute you can get on a free shuttle car near myeongdong station to the cable car where you buy a roundtrip ticket heading straight to the tower
1480,5,Going up N Seoul Tower was probably one of my highlights from my trip to Seoul We got the cable car up to the base of the tower where you then take a lift up to the top of the tower The cable car ride was about 3 mins long and cost around 4000 won Highly recommended for the immense views Also to enter and climb the tower you also need to pay around 8000 won At the base of the tower you can enjoy stunning views over seoul whilst enjoying the mass volume of Love locks that are secured to the railings I also enjoyed a banging hot dog in one of the restaurants as I waited for a ring to be engraved I highly recommend the whole experience to anyone who visits Seoul
1481,5,We enjoyed our trip to Seoul Tower Actually we had visited it back in 2006 but it was very crowded and so didnt actually go up This time we went on a weekday and had dinner at the lovely italian restaurant there Amazing view and great food
1482,2,I went there because I thought its such a landmark in Korea but really disappointednothing nice as I imaginedIf you want to go this place you must prepare some water and comfy shoes because It was so far far TT I suggest you that should go with some friends because during you reach on the top you might be feel dizzy on the waylol and you would be spend for this place at least 3  5 hrs for the long long queue for the lift take u up thereI confessed the view  atmosphere was so nice but It wasnt worth to spend time for your short tripI swear I dont go back this place again
1483,3,Nice place to visit but no need to pay for 9000 won just to go up to N Tower The observatory is not big and you were surrounded by many souvenirs
1484,2,Hike the mountains near by Not only is Namsam completely overcharged the mountains nearby are free give better views and have more history The food there was not memorable the ride overly expensive and its not hearly as high as the near mountains
1485,5,After visiting Willis tower we had to go here It was an excellent way to see the city On each window the tower lists a city and its distance from the city to seoul This was a fun way to see how far you are from different places you have visited There are also several other attractions such as the Teddy Bear Museum you can visit while you are there
1486,4,You really get a grand view of the Seoul from the tower It is situated right in the middle of Seoul and you can sense the size of Seoul We went there a bit late in the afternoon where it was dusk and it would have been better to go there a bit earlier But the night view is also recommendable
1487,4,Very nice place to visit A lot of people around so it gets crowded on the top especially in the evening as it is known as place for romance But to walk up the hill and see the view worth it
1488,5,Ive been here twice so far once in the daytime once at night Id recommend going at nighttimethe city just looks amazing lit up and it seemed more peaceful  Use the cable car to get up My first time here I couldnt find it so i walked up the whole mountain I dont recommend that unless youre quite the walker  Dont go during a long weekend I did that my first time and had to wait around an hour and 12 just to get up
1489,5,Great view Ok restaurant The revolving restaurant very expensive Elevator service very efficient Worth the effort
1490,5,Please note to avoid climbing you can take elevatorcar from the street below the mountain free which takes you to the cable car station payed which in turn takes you to the tower base where you can buy entrance to even higher view recommended
1491,5,1200 meters straing up overlook Seoul with 360 degrees of what can only be described as fantastic panoramas Try to pick one of the handful of clear days in Seoul we have about 5 to 10 a year and do bring a camera You could cheat and catch one of the gondollas or you can leaisurely hike up the couple of thousand steps to the tower taking as many breaks as you wish along the way Early to mid Fall is the best time to go and take in the thousands of wonderfull trees turning multiple shades of brown yellow red and everything in between A camera is a msut for this visit and give yourself pleanty of time to wonder once at the top Something is always going on in addition to the scheduled demonstrations by costumed soldiers and other entertainers Do take in the thousands of locks left behind by lovers from daus gone byvery interesting tradition
1492,2,Im not impressed I was a bit surprised by their very large boasting sign as you enter the elevator lobby that says voted 1 by foreign tourists I chuckled to myself and thought but foreign tourists are dumb Darn if I wasnt right  First the fastest elevator in the world has no windows in it Now I dont really love height and the windowed elevators in towers always scare me but geez  thats part of the show Watching the ground slip away from you is a thrill  Next the observatory just didnt feel special There wasnt a lookdown window so you can get the thrill of being suspended in the air And unless I missed it there was nothing to point out the major sites of the town  Sorry but I wasnt too impressed with the tower I could have settled for saving 9000 Won and just looking out from the base area
1493,3,While the Seoul Tower offers a nice view of the city I actually find it nicer to look at it from far Not a must visit if you have a packed schedule and dont have much time
1494,4,A tower atop Namsan mountain gives an impressive view of the sprawling Seoul Reached by Cable Car or a fairly challenging walk for the more energetic Top tip for men go to the loos at the tower for a pee with a view 
1495,1,Its one of the horrible place to visit in Seoul Money is charged at aevery point  8k per person for cable car 9k per person for elevator and 12k for photo which is 46k for a couple and at the end it turn out to be just a view of city which can be seen from any high rise bldingnot at all work visiting waste of money and time
1496,4,To truly appreciate the immensity and vastness that is the urban jungle of Seoul you have to see it to believe it What better place than the 360 view provided to you by being at the top of N Seoul Tower  The admission fee and the usual big crowds are nominal compared to the reward of what awaits you at the top Take a loved one and buy one of those romantic little love tiles to attach to the wall in the souvenir shop at the top for something truly special in Seoul  Oh and the view from the toilets are pretty spectacular too
1497,5,Superb all round views of Seoul from here Set in a natural surrounding and although at the top of a steep hill its worth going up the tower not just staying at the base
1498,4,You can either walk up to the tower or catch the cable car We chose to take the cable car up and walk down as if was very hot The queue for the cable car was very long and once in the queue it is difficult to get out so we wish we had walked Once up to the tower there was lots to see and we were surprised at how scenic it was in the middle of a city A great place to send a message of love We enjoyed the walk down and would recommend Seoul Tower to visitors
1499,3,The view from the hill on which the tower is situated is very nice especially at night The area has its own character We decided that is was not worth the extra US 15 to get to the observatory in the tower as i did not look to improve the view too much
1500,5,I am a bit jaded yet Seoul Tower was more than worth the time seeing it Its nice also hiking up a bit to the observation deck if you are so inclined and the weather is cooperative Be sure to visit the loo as it as some of the nicest views reminds me of the bathrooms at the Rainbow room  Also the collection of love locks are a must see There is also a little bit of the city wall and an example of the watchmen that used to guard the city uptop the Namsan Its not just a tall building
1501,4,Other than the fact that it was expensive to take the ride right up to the top of the tower the view of Seoul from the tower is awesome Will need to catch the cable car gg up to the foot of the tower before taking the high speed lift right to the top
1502,4,A should not be missed attraction if you are in Seoul It gives great view at the city especially at night Take the cable car up the hill While there dont forget to visit the teddy bear museum The lunch at the Chinese restaurant is good and service was fast It also have great view of city skyline
1503,5,It is the best place to start visit to Seoul Namsan Seoul Tower may be reached by cable car View from the Tower allows to observe all parts of the city
1504,5,From the top you can look out over Seoul especially on a clear day Labels on the windows tell you how far away many foreign countries are There are little gift shops where you can buy postcards and gifts You can have your picture taken and get two copies for a reasonable price Be sure to take a padlock with you so you can add to the love locks that people leave attached to the surrounding fences Fun to think you will forever be a part of a famous site There is also a Teddy Bear Museum and a cable car to ride We thought the food was pricey but loved the rest of our visit
1505,4,Perfect view at night  Youll feel like you see almost whole Seoul All streets look just like a fire stream and endlessly flow Ted bear museum is also nice looking and you can learn history related to the name of some areas in South Korea its really an enjoyable place especially for kids and couples
1506,5,Take the cable car across to the Tower at night for full enjoyment of the view crowds can be bothersome so go during the weeknights Grounds are perfect for biking and walking Exercize equipment located on grounds for the energetic
1507,3,The trip to get there via the cable car was nice You get good views The stairs from the cable car to the tower were a bit steep for my elderly parents and I dont remember seeing wheelchair access The bottom of the tower with the viewing points and the padlocked covered fences were pleasant enough You have to pay to enter the tower and go up the observation tower etc which we didnt do so cant comment on that It was a pleasant 23 hours to kill
1508,5,take a package that includes lunch and observations it has more value
1509,4,I have tried twice to get up the actual tower on a Saturday night You will wait over 2 hours in the eveningeven as late as 11 PM to get a chance to go up 10 a person 12 for the audio kitcheaper for kids The last tickets sold are like 10ish I beleive Everyone is up there and if you want to for sure go up plan on something to do while you wait There is a gorgeous pagoda all lit up to see under benches Cold Stone Creamery a few expensive restaurants and a small convienent store There are package deals to eat dinner and see the Teddy Bear place I did not do either I did use the green bus to get to the tower as well as the cable car to get down The cable car ride is gorgeous at night and worth the ride down Make sure you get in at the front so you can see the steep descent down The line will be very long for this as welloften times The cable car is at capacity of about 30 people and you will be cramped  At the top you can see behind the ticket box a terrace with this really cool art project about lovers Bring your camera and take lots of photos You can get a decent photo there of Seoul  At the top in the park area is also a typical style drinking fountain with multiple spouts for water and also plenty of bathrooms  The green electric bus will drop you off near the top but everyone has to walk the steep incline up about another 200 yards to get to the actual base of the tower  I did hike it up from Dongik University to the Seoul Tower park Its about a 7 KM walk up a 30 inlinegorgeous wooded paths on pavement and steps It will take you close to an hour to do it if you are a average person
1510,5,Love the view from the Tower and The Teddy bear Museum at the lobby Transportation around Nam San is excellent with the yellow bus
1511,4,make sure you go there at night or later afternoon You will have a good view of Seoul We ate at an italy restraunt at the base of the tower The food is not good and is expensive But we have a good view The N Seoul Tower has better view But so many people at night have to wait in line for elevator
1512,4,I visited on a very warm July day the month to avoid according to a previous TA poster and though the smog free view was very good not that the city is overly spectacular  It was fun writing a postcard and trusting the souvenir staff to attach stamps when you tape your money to the card via a plastic cover a good system and very popular
1513,5,N Seoul Tower is the landmark in Seoul and its good to visit there at any time day time or night time Nice view from there and you can also find a teddy bear museum there as well
1514,4,N Seoul Tower itself is worth visiting however if you want go really up not only up the mountain but up the tower it may seem a little pricey Either you take a cable car or climb the hill yourself the views are amazing Definitely worth going by foot in the evening and watch the sun go down No doubt its a no1 dating spot The love locks around the place are pretty amazing
1515,4,love the cable car although the trip was very short tried the rotating dining at the tower and the food we ordered was superb forgot the name of the dish though 
1516,3,After paying 8 or so to get up the mountain on the cable car I was not about to pay slightly more again simply to go up even higher above the usual grey smoggy day in Seoul and to say I had done it I paid even more in Shanghai for 95 storeys and believe me smog is smog no matter what the altitude of where you are standing The tower is simply a tourist trap in the classic sense Somewhat surprisingly I had a reasonably priced meal on the ground level there however
1517,5,i like the concept inside especially the teddy bear museum and the highest floor viewing area Is almost 280Meter of the ground Up there at night u can see the whole city lights of  Seoul U can even spot ur own country singapore by the glass panel stating how far ur country is from the towel
1518,5,You can go up and see all Seoul but to take pics it was a bit difficult as the windows were quite dirty But the feeling it truly amazing If your camera died down dont worry there is Staff that takes Pics and you can buy them afterwards There is an really good italienfrench Restaurant on the first floor just around the corner after the exit with a really nice Sunset to look at with Seoul in front of you
1519,5,The baby and I went up to the tower by gondola and the others walked which they said was easy and lovely walking through the trees with good walking paths Taking the trip up to the tower by very fast elevator was a trip in itself especially when you looked up to the ceiling The view of Seoul from the very top was spectacular and a great way to view the entire citywow Plenty of good amenities up top shops very clean toilets and good coffee and beer Great place for photos Worth purchasing the photo they take of you coming out of the lift  great memento A truly fantastic attraction for everyone
1520,4,I visited this place in 2006 and two years ago It is tiring to go up on a hot summer day so avoid going there during hot july month
1521,4,nice place on the hill top need to climb a steep slope to reach from the bust stop Good scenery Can see North Korea beyond the mountains Can see the seoul city from the top Good food also available there
1522,4,The tower offers great views of the city I found the hike up through Namsan Park even more fun but you can also arrivedepart via cable car
1523,4,The street up to the cable car station is quite steep so if its hot its a good idea to take the free elevator which goes from the main street right below the station The cable car runs every 10 minutes The park around the tower is clean and cool There was no queue to get up in the tower  which was very nice The view is very good  you really get an implession on how large the city is
1524,3,Having been to Tokyo Tower the N Seoul Tower did not give me the wow experience when I went up to admire the night scenery It could be because there wasnt much to look out for when at the top The view at every angle seemed the same to me Perhaps it could be better if there was a guide pointing out the landmarks to spot when viewing from a certain part of the tower The only prominent feature I could identify was probably the Han River  There are also hourly light shows that will be beamed on the tower itself starting from 8 pm But honestly you can skip it and head straight for the tower It is nothing fanciful  The place like every tourist attraction is full of people and waiting time to get up to the viewing gallery can span up to 30 minutes and that was when I visited on a weekday so I suggest that you avoid weekends or public holidays which in my opinion will take even longer  TIP Tower admission fees are 9000 won for adults but you can enjoy a 10 discount if you use the coupon provided when you purchase a Seoul City Pass Plus their public transport card but specially for foreigners card It is more convenient to get up there via cable car 8000 won for adults round trip but if you want some exercise or just want to take a slow stroll up by all means
1525,4,The Namsan tower is the second tower Ive visited yet next to the Sky Peak in Hong Kong I came to visit the tower using the Namsan Cable car The view from the top was just outstanding It was just too bad for me that my cameras battery went low by night time I felt so unluckybut thanks to my new found companions they offered to take a some pictures of me and send them to my email  When you are at the top observation deck of the tower try to notice the info on the glass wall There you might find your country with its kilometer distance from Korea Amazing
1526,4,The views from up there on a clear day arre spectacular
1527,4,Weather will make or break your Seoul tower experience  Cant drive nor take taxi there Must take bus or use cable car near myeongdong  Must visit if never been to Seoul
1528,4,Went to the teddy bear museum there alot smaller the jeju island but nice  Do not go to N Seoul Tower on a korea hoilday Was there once on a public hoilday and the qing was so long
1529,4,I went up to the tower via the cable car which is the more convenient way compared to taking the bus which I heard you have to climb a very long flight of stairs up to the tower Plus you get to see the scenery while inside the cable car Theres also the teddy bear museum which you can purchase the tickets in a package observatory and teddy bear museum You can visit the teddy bear museum first because the sun doesnt set until about 8pm as it is better to watch the city view in night time
1530,4,The tower has great views of the city and if you are in the neighborhood it is worth seeing This is like a 20 minutes stop on your itinerary The admission price is very reasonable compared to other types of towers
1531,5,Being from Seattle this reminded us of the space needle We visited the tower and placed a lock on the lock wall celebrating our adoption of our daughter Locks are available for purchase on site There is also a sketch artist That does amazing work Also a cold stone ice cream kiosk
1532,4,we walked from namdaemun it was to long other people said the just caught a taxi
1533,3,Its easy to get to the tower Basically you can go to Chungmuro Station or Itaewon Station and just take a bus directly goes to the tower Basically the unique thing about the N Seoul tower is the love locks The center store is also great for shopping The Teddy Bear Museum is average I wont recommend you to visit it if you dont have craving for Teddy Bear or if you dont have kids with you
1534,2,tower is high on the hill but night scene is not breath taking not much high rises and city light to look for too much people line up for cable car since they close at 2300 and the tower close at 2200 the tower admission is way over priced
1535,5,When I show guests around Seoul Namsan is a must Whether you go up the tower or not should depend on the weather On a clear day it is well worth it however on a day with limited visibility you are just as well off staying on the ground Views from Namsan and the tower are even more stunning at night when Seoul lights up beneath you However you should be aware that the main viewing platform is closed off at around 1011pm The easiest way to get up to the tower is to take the Number 2 bus from Chungmuro station on line numbers 3 and 4 The cable car from near Myeongdong is a romantic option although it is a little more expensive  The restaurant at the top of the tower is good for special occasions and the food served is excellent
1536,3,Its OK you get a really good view of Seoul but not much else going for the tower I guess its incredible at night But once you get down from the tower its just a short walk to Namdaemun Market and Myeongdong which you should not miss
1537,5,we loved the cable car going up we loved going up the flight of stairs and we loved seeing all of Seoul from the N tower  There is a burger house there and the burger is actually good Try the fries I loved that the most I am sorry but I can not remember the name of that burger joint  Our friends brought their locks and guests can place their memory locks for free If you havent brought one with you they have a store where you can buy an assortment of locks  must see for Seoul
1538,4,The N Seoul Tower displays different colors at night Its a sight youve got to see 
1539,5,The view is fantastic from up there The fact that the tower is situated on a hill makes the view from the top more spectacular especially at night
1540,3,N Seoul is nice good view very fast elevator I enjoy going here though you have to walk tour way up the hill I dont know if it was just us or our travelling agent but hiking up is no joke I was dead tired really
1541,3,It was ok whilst cheap not sure you need to actually go up the tower when you can see the same from the platform below
1542,5,Although it was raining when we visited there we stayed till the sunset and we enjoyed seeing the lights over Seoul city It was stunning The cable car ride was also a good experience
1543,4,You cant miss the tower you can see it from all over Seoul  Its a must try rated as the most visited place in Seoul for tourists  There is a cable car at Namsam that brings you up to the tower or take the bus Cable car is 8000W for a return trip or 2400W for a bus ride  The area under the tower is great it has food stalls and some great places to take pictures sit down chat and talk the ambiance is great The views are breathtaking go at night on a clear night and you can see pretty much all of Seoul  There is a souvenir shop a minimart and several restaurants  Theres an hourly light show on tower that was fun to watch  The keychain memorial was pretty unique and good to see  It was worth going to we didnt go up anymore to the tower as the kids were having too much fun running around the park
1544,4,Like the towers of the world it is one of icon in Seoul Better to visit after the sunset in order to get night view if you take cable cabin you can look at the nothern part of Seoul only When you arrive at the summit you can see southern part of Seoul including the Han river which devides Seoul into 2 parts there is some small restaurants and dirnks shops If you take a tickets you can go up to the top of the tower
1545,4,The cable car to N Seoul tower gives great views of the city and the views from the tower are great This time we stayed at the bottom but there are lots of places to eat and things to do We did the padlock memory thing there too and had ice cream so it was great fun
1546,4,I think this is a great place to enjoy the view of Seoul city I took cable car there once and the other time took the bus up there On the way there were some people walking to the tower which was totally awesome but for me its too challenging P So any means of transportation you will enjoy it I recommend going from the cable car Its about 8000 KRW for the round trip and 6000 KRW for single ride So what do you do there once reach the towerENJOY Yes taking photos and enjoy the views You can also place your locks which is symbolizing your etenal love with your partner  but dont throw the key down from the tower Lots of people do that and there is warning sign not to do so On the tower there is teddy bear museum and cafe You can buy a ticket to the upper level of the tower But I dont think its necessary though
1547,5,This was our first tourist stop in Seoul It was a great way to get to know the city not just because of the views but for the people as well People watching is amazing at the tower We walked up the mountain which made for a good workout The park surrounding the tower is beautiful
1548,3,Initially was planning to walk from Myeongdong Metro Station passing Pacific hotel to the cable car station for the cable car that takes you up to N Seoul Tower until other reviewers mentioned about the steep walk We cleverly avoided it by taking advantage of the free shuttle bus from our hotel IBIS Ambassador Myeongdong The bus took us right to the cable car station On the way back we did the walk down from the cable car station to the Myeongdong station and yes I can imagine it to be very tiring going uphill  Cable car costs Won 8000 for adult and Won 5000 for child return There is another separate entrance fee for going up the N Seoul Tower  Won 9000 for adult and Won 5000 for child At the base of the tower before taking a lift up your photographs will be taken behind a plain backdrop and superimposed onto a day scene and a night scene Costs Won 12000 for both photos or Won 10000 for one There is also a Teddy Bear museum which we didnt have time for  At the top of the N Seoul tower there are windows showing distances to different parts of the world eg Auckland NZ 958219 km You can walk one round 360 degrees The toilets have good views too People seemed to love buying postcards and posting them into the mail box provided There is a shop selling souvenirs  Outside the tower at the base are shops and an area fence and trees filled with different coloured locks Apparently couples come to lock their love eternally There are also 2 guards in colourful costumes watching the tower My sons enjoyed playing the traditional Tuho game where you throw sticks trying to get them into holes of poles  I dropped my return cable car tickets but by some miracle found them near the spot where I lost them Some kind soul must have picked them up and put them safely in one of the holes in the side wall Thank you whoever you are  Go on a fine day for the best views
1549,5,You can take the cable car or you can walk up there  I recommend the walk because the path is paved and very well maintained You can get to the entrance of Namsan Park by following the signs from the Hoehyeon metro station Once inside Namsan Park it takes 4560 minutes to walk up to the top where you can buy a ticket to go to the observation decks inside the tower The path mainly consists of stone steps and running shoes are recommended You can take the same path back down or keep walking through a nice park to get to Dongguk University where you can pick up the metro again
1550,5,The view is spectacular Well worth the time and a few Wons We took a taxi up to the tower extra 2000 wons and cable car down extra cost but better then walking Take your camera Lots of pictures They do have a smog concern but mid day was great
1551,5,We went there and placed our lock up there Its quite romantic You can also see the whole city of Seoul It has an awesome bathroom with great view on top The best time to go up there is in the evening that way you get to see both day light and at night Then just take a cable car or bus down and continue the next sight seeing spat myeongdong shopping street
1552,4,This is part of our tour and didnt include the cable car ride so we had to drive up and walk uphill to the tower To those who are not very fit physically be forewarned This is not an easy climb Its a long and steep climb You can take it easy though and make stops along the way An elevator takes you to the top of the tower and from the top you can see a good view of Seoul Your picture is taken before entering the elevator and you can get it when you are on the top of the tower 2 pictures with day and night views of the Seoul Tower plus mounting costs 15000 won
1553,3,I think you will appreciate the place more if it it not too cold You can see the whole of Seoul from the top
1554,5,This was one of my favorite places in Seoul The walk from the metro station to the cable car is a bit of a hike up a steep road but I think you can also take a bus to the cable carjust not sure where you get the bus from The grounds surrounding the tower are very well laid out with lots of area to walk around and sit and take pictures There are a w restaurants one American one Chinese and one Italian  that you can enjoys while waiting for the perfect time to go to the observation deck My friendss and I went to the Teddy Bear museum while we were there and it was hilarious It may not be as funny if you are traveling alone but for a group of four after a few beers we definitely were highly entertained The view from the observation deck at night is awesome Definitely worth the money And I have to agree with a recent review about the bathrooms they are super fancy and offer a great view of the city I think this is a great activity for friends families with children and for couples
1555,4,Resonable value at 9000krw for the observation terrace and access to use the toilets well I only tried the mens with the best view in Korea  Get the cable car to the summit dont walk up it like I did I nearly died
1556,5,A must see in Seoul A very impressive 360 view of Seoul that you cannot get anywhere else Very enjoyable for both adults and children alike however parents with wee ones in Strollers may want to think twice as the cable lift drops you only on the lower level of the mountian still leaving quite a walk up several flights of stair cases straight up hill to reach the tower  Located near the city center a very good combiation of attractions is to combine the tower visit with a day of shopping at Nam de moon market which is close by and also a must see
1557,5,I had a weekend free in Seoul and went up the tower there I went up in the cable car from the bottom of the hill but the cars can get very crowded and if I go again I would walk  at least down the hill There are restaurants at the base of the tower that are reasonably priced and you can get a cool beer if you do walk up from the bottom of the hill The queues for the tower itself were fairly quickmoving and just before you go up in the elevator there is an excellent lightshow of Seoul viewed from the tower Obviously if you go up in the day you wont have seen the lights of the city so this is a good compromise Once on the viewing platform I was surprised to find it was multilevel and reasonably spacious It does offer a 360 degree look across the city and surroundings and you finally see just how huge Seoul really is The park the tower stands in is nice and it was a pleasant surprise for me how many locals smiled and nodded as I walked around This all contributed to a very pleasant tourist experience and I would have no hesitation in going again
1558,4,I wouldnt recommend it during a foggy smoggy or rainy time but when the air is clear you get a wonderful view of the city around you
1559,5,The cable car going up to the tower lobby was fun lots of shops and restaurants at the top Recommend to go at night to see the light show and enjoy the cold weather i maybe biased with the weather bec i come from a tropical country so i enjoy cold temperature
1560,5,Reservations were at 5 PM so we were able to watch the sunset Awesome food a 5 course meal Had wine to compliment our dinner a bit pricy but worth it Our kids brought a lock along for us to put on a tree a very special evening
1561,4,We went at N Seoul Tower at night and it gave us a great city light view of Seoul The cable car ride to the top can be crowded as they try to fit a lot of people in You might want to consider seeing the Teddy Bear Museum if youre into teddy bears and stuffs Really cute and interesting exhibits
1562,5,It is very good to see at night and what is more is Teddy Bear stadium
1563,4,The cable car to Seoul Tower can be accessed after long walk from Myeongdong station For first timers like us it was a bit difficult to locate the cable car station Our only clue was we were heading towards the direction where the tower is and the flow of people we believed were also going to the cable car station  The cable car ride gave us the view of Seoul at night It is a short trip to the top  It was an amazing view at the top especially that we decided to go there at night The famous love padlocks is located here There are also a lot of restaurants to choose from but most of them were already closing by the time we got there Nevertheless the view in itself was enough reason after a tiring walk This is a must see place in Seoul but recommended to be visited at night
1564,5,When I went to the tower we took the walking path which was a complete workout but there were many beautiful views that you can appreciate much more as opposed to the cable car There are several restaurants at the top that look over the city very romantic Every hour in the evening they have a light show not mind blowing but cool
1565,5,KDrama lovers you will know this is a Mustvisit place when in Seoul On a clear day the view of Seoul from the top of the tower is breathtaking One of the best places to get souvenirs too
1566,5,With a subway near to the tower around 10 minutes walking its a very good place to visit The teddy bear museum is interesting to see some historical scenes represented with bears
1567,5,We thought we would not bother to go here but our host took us and we are definitely glad we went Seeing all the locks was amazing
1568,5,Lovely place to visit to get a birds eye view of Seoul Was easy to get to using the tram  For the couples who are looking to hang your lock you could buy your own and bring it up to save money but the ones sold at the stores are not that expensive anyway
1569,5,make sure you go to the Teddy Bear Museum Very interesting
1570,4,I had a lovely visit to the Tower on a brisk Autumn day The trees were so beautiful dressed in their reds and golds
1571,5,N Seoul is beautiful Ive been up there in the morning afternoon and evening Each time has its charm Evening time gives it that touch of romance especially with the lights
1572,3,We went to the Tower in late December just before Christmas And we were lucky to be there in late afternoon so we saw the lights coming on at dusk around the cityyou can make out the arteries streets bridges because they are completely lit up by cars stuck in the perennial traffic jam Though a complete tourist trap if you do want an overview of the hugh metropolis that is Seoul this place is definitely worth a visit Other than that I do have one more recommendation Do not miss out on the view from the washroom I am speaking for the gentsFor a similar experienceview comparable to this you have to go to the top of a medieval hill town village hundreds of feet above the Mediterranean Eze in the Cote dAzur The washroom of the restaurantcafe called the golden goat While coming down the hill we unwittingly got into a fake taxi that was waiting there to trap foreign tourists This was the only time in Korea when we got robbed in a cab In general our experience with taxis in Korea had been good A journey to Itaewon that should cost around 5000 wonabout 5 turned into ten times as much Hint You try to get into a parked cab The driver points you to a car behind You assume that is also a legitimate taxi It does have a meter Only one that wouldnt stop jumping for even a split second Before you know it you owe the guy 75 bucks We got off for 50
1573,5,and also you know how far your origin city is from Seoul Visit also the Teddy Bear Museum you can buy a combo ticket
1574,4,Nice but from subway to the namsam elevator hard to find
1575,5,Nice trip nice people nice weathersuperb
1576,5,Even though the temperatures were really cold what set this visit apart from the others was 1 it snowed for us the first time in Seoul when we were approaching NSeoul tower  it was almost magical for us 2 we had a nice hot cup of cocoa at the top of NSeoul tower in a quaint and quiet cafe whist overlooking at a lovely view of Seoul and 3 we got our caricatures done at a small little tent at the base of the tower for 40000 won This was for 2 people with a nice and solid wooden frame and a glass cover   Do make a visit in the evening  its such a romantic place filled with a scenery you will never forget 
1577,4,This is like the Eiffel tower of Seoul My wife and i caught the subway which was a mistake We ended up walking up the stairs which was tiring As a foreigner you are able to catch a cab to the base and then catch the lift to the top  Its a great way to get to know the layout fo the city and learn lots about the city This was my second favourite after the DMZ
1578,5,I did this the first evening I was in Seoul My friends family and I took the cable car 7500 won for adult round trip; 5000 for children It was fun to see the city slip away below without the extra effort to walk up the hill which for my jetlagged self would have been torture  It was awesome to see all of the lights of Seoul from the top of N Seoul Tower 9000 won adult; 5000 child The walls have world city names and mileage on them apparently indicating in which direction you are looking I found NYC but not Boston close enough  The locks on the wall were a very cool idea and I suddenly wished I could have brought my honey with me so that we could cuddle with all of the other couples who were enjoying the scenery and ambience
1579,3,The first cable car was worth it it gives access to nice views The second cable car however wasnt worth it Its rather expensive you have to wait in line and the view is not that much better
1580,3,We took a taxi to the cablecar Rode the cablecar up the mountain  The N Seoul Tower is typically touristy You ride an elevator to the viewing area on top of the tower Good views of the city  We were in a group so we had a ball  We decided to walk down  boy was it fun  The winding roads with trees on both sides made for a lovely walk  Personally I wouldnt recommend a trip tp the viewing area of the tower The cablecar ride is fun The sitting area  the base of the N Seoul tower is gorgeous  The walk down the tower is fantastic
1581,4,Like many other towers N Seoul Tower offers great view of the city on a clear bright day or night if you are going there at night
1582,4,One of those once in a life things nice views at the top of Seoul The trip there was a good experience 3km walk up a hill pass a lot of things Cable car ride back down
1583,4,Seouls N Tower provides an interesting view of the city from high above and the love locks are a pretty funny sight worth seeing  I was hoping to get some good shots of the city from up the tower but there is nowhere where you can shoot without looking through fingerprinted glass and the angle of the glass makes it challenginglimits the angles of pictures your able to take I was able to get some worthy pictures but not what I was hoping  All in all it is a worthy stop and provides a good view of the city that you will otherwise be unable to see
1584,4,The Tower is located on a hilltop in the middle of Seoul and gives you a fantastic 360 degree view over the whole city If you go to Seoul you should start any visit there to get a great overview of this busy city in South Korea On the top floor you also have indications of various sightseeing spots around town and on the second floor on the top there is even a cafe where you can enjoy the view
1585,1,The cable car cost us 7500 won return but it was so packed and we cant enjoy the view only took around 510 minscompare it with NgongPing 360 in HongKong or the one in Taipeithis one is terrible in terms of customer experience  While the tower itselfcost us 7000 won for observatoryhmnothing really special basically
1586,5,The Seoul Tower is really not difficult to access I just walked to it and it was not even a hike but a nice walk
1587,5,The views are amazing but I also really recommend walking up and down the hill instead of the cable car if you can  Its a long climb but so worth it especially if you go at sunset Youll also skip the long cable car queues this way
1588,4,I went to Namsan on my first day at Seoul I went there at golden hour to catch winter sun set Seeing Seoul from top bathed in golden sun rays it was really worthy went all the way to Namsan Tower against breezing wind winter A cup of hot chocolate was enough to keep me warm during my visit
1589,4,The day we arrived in Seoul after putting our luggage at the hotel we straight away took a bus to Namsan Tower I booked the ticket using Klook and scanned the ticket at the entrance The view at night is amazing you can see the whole area If you have strong legs you can walk up the hill
1590,4,We visited it during weekday to avoid the long line of the cable car We skipped the ticket line by purchasing it thru Klook The view is much nicer in autumn
1591,4,Its a pretty nice place I enjoyed the hike up to the tower got some great pictures Not really worth the money to go all the way up to the tower tho
1592,5,Super awesome place I really love everything from here  Would like to go back again here Super worth it
1593,4,We had 1 day in Korea so we decided to go despite the weather It was a lot of people local and foreigners We can only imagine how spectacular it would be on clear day
1594,5,What a gorgeous view of Seoul at night When we got on the bus to go to the tower I didnt realize that it was at the top of a hillmountain so I was surprised that we didnt just walk but I was thankful as we made our way up the windy roads that walking wasnt happening It was definitely worth the trip and I loved the whole experience Would definitely do it again next time I come to Seoul but maybe during the day next time
1595,4,There is LED tunnel Love Lock area and also the observatory deck It is best to go with lover Easy to go there by bus or cable car
1596,5,beautiful and clean inside and out Alot of history is shown throughout the area of the towerThe ride in the elevator was beautiful  look up when you get inside the elevator
1597,3,The tower is interesting but probably not worth visiting unless you have a nice clear day It was dull the day we went and you couldnt see much
1598,4,Its quite a ride to get to the tower but the stunning view the adjoining Hello Kitty museum and Ryans Cheezball Adventure is worth the effort The all around view from the tower also tells you in which direction your country is from that spot and the distance too It was an evening beautifully spent
1599,3,I didnt go to the actual tower but rode up to it and put a lock on the lock wall If you can bring your own definetly do as they are overprised  and dont forget a pen as they have none for you to use  only to buy The view was pleasant and the price was fine
1600,2,If you are planning to go to the observatory mind the weather conditions as they do not have any notice about the visibility They did not offer to give a refund or to make it valid for another day Very disappointed
1601,5,A tall towers light ignite the beautiful sky of Seoul on the top of the hill that is called N Seoul TowerNamsan Tower With its astonishing beauty Namsan mountain flourished with locals and foreigners alike  This is a place where love Cupids make their wish and lock their love in the pad lock to symbolize eternity of true love or finding love of their life A breezy windy moment spend with love one and beautiful scenery of Seoul city 
1602,4,A quintessential tourist stop in the outskirts of Seoul We did not go up the tower Just hung around the base area and took in the scenic beauty There are locks for sale for the lovebirds to place on the fences A lovely view of the city from the top of the hill
1603,5,This is where you can find the famous Love Locks in Seoul Offers a beautiful view of the city during the day  a magical view at night
1604,5,Wonderful Romantic and Memorable thats what weve experience visiting N Seoul Tower or Namsan Seoul Tower In the chilly dusk of November in Seoul we went here via Bus 3 in Chungmuro station exit 4 The ride took about 30 mins because its the rush hour and many stops so if you would like a faster way to get here can take the Namsan Cable car or taxi or you could hike to the tower itself Takes around 1100 won one way and it is the last stop in its route There are many tourists in the entrance and buses both public and tour buses and parked there so it tends to get busy Indeed it is one of the most visited attractions in Seoul Standing high at 774 ft it is an observation and communications tower and the second highest in Seoul It is my second time to visit this place but this time during the day My first time in 2016 it was at night and we went on top of the observation deck inside the tower overlooking Seoul from Namsan Mountain where its located right at the heart of Seoul The ticket costs around 11000 KRW This time around 2019 we didnt go inside but we visited the base of the tower which surrounded by the beautiful Namsan park and its wide array of trees that include Maple Pine Ginko Cherry blossoms and many more Since its fall the colors are full of Red Yellow Orange White and Brown truly mesmerizing eye catching romantic and beautiful We took a lot fo beautiful photos and videos before these blooming trees in the colours of Autumn Up here you will have a panoramic view of Seoul  its skyscrapers buildings castles villages and rivers It is indeed a magical view for us You dont even need to go up the observation deck Another great feature we did is the Lock Padlocks where tourists and local couples put their padlocks as a key of their endearing love for each other You could write your names and buy the keypadlock from the minimart inside N Seoul Tower We indeed put our padlock in the midst of thousands of locks placed in this mountain The Lock Padlocks also offer a great panoramic view of Seoul the Tower and Namsan Park We left just before night falls via bus and it was a short yet memorable visit for us It is indeed of the best and beautiful destinations in Seoul so please do come visit when you arrive here in Seoul Korea
1605,4,Like any tower in the world N Seoul Tower has its own unique attractions Located on the top of Namsan mountain it offers breathtaking 360degree views of Seoul city There are 2 public transportation options to get there via cable car or bus Via the cable car there is no immediate subway access and youll need to walk up the hill from Myeongdong subway station Mind you if youre traveling with young children or elderly this can pose a challenge Or you can take bus No 02 No 03 and No 05  Once at the base of the tower the area is clean and pleasant to visit Dont miss out on the love padlocks near the tower base for nice phototaking opportunities To get to the top of the tower requires separate entrance tickets
1606,4,Very touristy but you can see the whole city We walked up the mountain but realized afterward that there are 3 city buses that go to the top
1607,3,Two options to the top of the tower hike or take a cable car We decided to take the cable car After purchasing the tickets we have to stand in a very long queue which goes up two floors to reach the cable car station It too us 40 minutes before we got into the car The ride was smooth but the view from the car and from the tower is nothing special We went there in the night expecting nice views but there is too much light which prevents us from getting a good view of the city see picture  Lot of young couples around who come to lock their love on the railings of the tower using a paddlock This seems to be a popular belief There are restaurants and souvenier shops in the tower
1608,3,We went there upon arrival so we not dat familiar with the subway and bus  we kinda took the wrong route but ended up at the entrance near the library It is quite a hike to go up so we wud recommend you to take the shuttle bus no 3 or 5 which wud bring you up to the tower  It is true that the best view wud b at night but you wud want to be there before the sun goes down for photo purposes We took the bus to myeongdong after our trip to namsan
1609,4,We got off the hop on hop off bus at this stop on a whim and had a brilliant visit here We spent a good two hours wandering around and taking pictures of the fantastic views over the city We didnt bother to get tickets to go up the upper tower as the views would only have been more distant We did however take a return trip on the Namsan Cable Car and got some good views from that A very worthwhile visit Unfortunately we werent able to visit at night to see the skyline lit up but Im sure it would have been brilliant
1610,5,It is the best place to see the Seoul at a glance  Weather was really awesome too  I enjoyed it a lot
1611,4,Great place to have a 360 view of the city There is usually a long wait so depending on when you get there you might have to get a ticket and youll be told the time you can go up
1612,5,We took a ride till the tower It cost 7000 won for one way and 9500 won for round way but we had to wait about 45 min for a ride so if you can just walk there The way up ist beautiful The tower stands in the middle of the park so you can enjoy amazing view Sometimes there also performances and we saw one with traditional warriors of Joseon  was a surprise for us Totally worth it
1613,5,Make sure you get here around 5pm so you can see the sunset I walked up here via the extensive paths around the park
1614,3,We stopped here as part of a tour so we had our own usher who guided us to the elevators The grounds are pleasant and parts of the old city wall can be seen in various places The light show at the elevator was a bit much The top floor with all the windows was filled with souvenir shops Great views of the city however
1615,4,It is better to use cable car to go up there because walking is not suitable for OKU old folks less exercise people The way to reach N Seoul Tower is too deep Unfortunately the day i reached N Seoul Tower the cable car is on maintenance so we need to go up and down by foot Luckily the weather is good and cooling The scenery is undoubtable and very nice One thing that need to take note is to reach the observatory floor there is only one lift and the only way to go there Please queue at the right floor as we experienced queueing at 2 floors but the lift isnt stop and always full To advise just wait at ground floor The love locks area is full and we decided not to lock because seems no empty space to put on it The view from top is very good worth to pay a visit
1616,3,Long queues and poor visibility due to the weather a far better viewing platform can be found at Lotte World Tower
1617,5,Can enjoy beautuful whole seoul city viewrecommend for evening time  but verrryyyyy long waiting line for cable car ticketalmost one hour
1618,4,More than the tower itself how to get to the top is the most interesting part Based on what you prefer you can do a 35 K rolling hill walk combination of flat walk with some decent hikes  some through steps and rest through single lane path series of steps all the way to the top or take the cable car to the top If you are staying nearby good area to go for a morning walk or a run
1619,4,There are so many LOVE lock place everywhere down the Tower make u feel full of love before go up to the Tower I like to pick candies and sit inside the tower to enjoy the view I prefer go there before 300pm otherwise you needed to line up to get uphill by cable car
1620,5,Its an amazing tower in Seoul You can see all Seoul from the top Nice places ther is restaurant and coffee shop
1621,5,Best is go there in the night And I alway stay at Myeongdong area and make sure that my hostel or guesthouse can see N Seoul tower view 
1622,5,I had tried to go to N Seoul Tower on a Sunday and the queue was so long it would have taken at least 2 hours to get up plus it was rainy  Instead I went back the next day and not only was it better weather and almost no queue but they didnt make me buy a new ticket and even offered to refund my ticket from the previous day  I went up the little elevator to the cable car where there was free entertainment I did not expect to see  From there I visited the Hello Kitty museum which is small but so cute  Then I got in the elevator to the top of the tower There are cool projections on the way up making it feel like youre shouting into space The view from the tower is incredible  A super fun day out and really reasonably priced
1623,4,Its better for me take the hop of hop off so they in a way explained historic places the other just take you at their time at the end goes to a natural antiaging shop
1624,5,The hiking till the tower is absolutely worth it Once you reach the top there are several shops and resturants typical stuff for turist I really advice to pay the fee to go at the top floor of the Tower Beautiful experience
1625,4,I went during the day so I could see the area clearly The views were very good and the windows on the observation deck showed what major city was in that direction and how far the distance is from there
1626,5,Do go there if you get the chance The drive to the top of the hill is through a beautiful parkCars have to park at the bottom but buses are allowed to drive three quarters of the way upThere is a steep climb at the end but well worth it You are taken into a room with a picture of cars travelling along on the floor which was quite spectacularThe ride in the lift up to the top was spectacular with a visual experienceOutstanding views at the top with great photo opportunities Loved it
1627,5,Awesome location and must visit activity Go there prior sunset and stay there until sunsets to view sunset
1628,5,we follow google maps and we missed the stop better listen to the announcement in the bus since we missed the stop we walked to the Namsan Library From Namsan library we chosed to walk steep 16 kmnot to hard in autumn since the cool temperature it was beautiful and crowded especially during the sunset timeeverything trying to find the perfect spot for taking video pictures during sunset there are some cafes down there food not bad but the service is quite long Going down no problem there were some busses that would take us downtown
1629,3,Too many lines No sign posts View of city was not clear since the glass was reflective The view from nearby Signeol Seoul was much much better If in Seoul one could consider going to tick off the list but this ones quite average
1630,5,Was a big walk up we chose not to take the sky lift take plenty of water and good shoes Its doable though and worth the good work out Great views by the time you get to the top the tower is more like a lighthouse so dont be worried if issues with heights Beautiful views worth seeing
1631,4,The tower gives a great opportunity for fantastic views over the city Even at base level the views are great but the 360 view from the observatory is better However its not the cheapest of venues to visit  so make sure its a clear day else its an expansive cloud view There ate various floors of food stalls  kid activities
1632,5,Namsam tower is a must go not only for locals but visitors alike especially I youre looking for a romantic scenery Although it can get a bit crowded sometime it is well worth the travel at least once in your life Its not only for couples so dont feel left out if you are alone If you are a couple bring a lock with you to secure your love on a rail fence at the top My suggestion is to go right before sunset instead of daytime the city lights is very beautiful so you can observe both day and night while youre up there
1633,4,Lots of development around the tower over the past several years My favorite way to get there is walking one of the many paths through the woods I get lost every time I go so I will not try to give directions Other options to the tower are cable car and bus There is are shuttle buses that regularly circle loops between popular tourist destinations  this is easy and convenient The tower now has many little shops restaurants coffee shops plenty of snacks and trinkets to buy even without buying a ticket to go up the tower This is nice in case you are there on a cloudy day when its not worth the  to go up the tower Also plenty of photo ops and opportunity to get a love lock or leave your cell phone cover on the fences not sure what this is all about visit the hello kitty island etc a trip up the old radio tower is quite spectacular  they have a neat light display before the fast elevator ride to the viewing floor On the observation floor there are signs to let you know what you are seeing pretty amazing views on a clear day and of course shops to buy snacks and souvenirs Its been ages since we visited the restaurants up in the tower It was a nice experience however limited vegetarian options and not really great for little children Overall a good place to visit better on a clear day wonderful to get a little exercise if you have the time and ability Something for everyone at the tower  I would go again and absolutely bring friendsfamily when they come to visit
1634,4,Recommend coming here in the evening for a great view of Seoul lit up I didnt go on the observation deck but managed to get good views of the city from down below There are a few reasonably priced restaurants on the lower floors of the tower Bus no 2 goes here from the Chungmuru area
1635,4,As usual the tower Is a must if you wish to see the city from the top Great view and location around is also interesting
1636,3,Well you gotta do it when in Seoul right Trouble is everyone else had the same idea so it was rammed at the top  Terrific view though as youd expect although the glare from the gift shops reflects a bit too much on the windows at nighttime spoiling photos a little  Im glad we went; but it was just ok and didnt wowme
1637,4,Very good to visit but if possible avoid of the weekend as it can get quite busy Be prepared to wait for at least 1 hour in the line each way
1638,4,Beautiful birds eye view of the city But the waiting time is very high Better to visit during summer
1639,3,N Tower has great views from the top of Namsan yet the facilities are old tower gets very crowded and is a little bit overpriced
1640,5,Despite it being extremely windy from the typoon we still had a good visit Amazing views We had lunch at the restaurant which was amazing You cant beat dining with a view like that And for something different definitely use the toilet facilities its worth it
1641,4,Seoul lies out there like 30 big cities all so close together that theyve become one Great view but it can be crowded  The view from the actual tower is impressive but you have to pay for it and the view from the bottom is just fine as well
1642,4,Its a popular place for both tourists and locals Especiallyat night many tourists go there to look around the Seoul city with the beautiful light
1643,4,I have visited this place in Feb 2019 Located near Myeongdong Subway Station We can reach there either by ropeway or by walk Best time to visit is in the evening There is one place on the tower where couples tie locks like Pont des arts Paris Try to avoid this place on weekend as it will be crowded
1644,2,To be honest I found this tower to be way too touristy We went there in the evening to enjoy the lights of Seoul but we were kind of disappointed You have to wait in line for quite a while to take the elevators to the observation deck of the tower and when you eventually get up the reflections of the candy and souvenir shops in the tower spoil the view You can buy and write postcards that get stamped in the tower itself but the view is better when you stay outside on the hill  Not worth the money
1645,5,Went on a sunday night  the queue for the cable car was huge We waited about 40 minutes The view from the top is amazing though  we were fortunate with the weather too
1646,5,I love Seoul Korea N Tower gives a breath taking view of Seoul It has the locks bridge souvenir shops cafes Hello Kitty shop cable car ride Cant wait to see this place again
1647,4,Fairly busy place Take a bus 02 to get there via line 4 Easy to get there The main issue is getting to the entrance as the lift is full most of the time Once you enter the tower you will be entertained with visual lights  Remember best place to take photo is in the observatory deck toilet
1648,5,Beautiful place but there is a big long walk hill that needs good fit body and not recommended to go on summer really hot The place is clean and perfect for souvenirs they have the best collection for the tower
1649,5,I love this place Situated about 480 meters above sea level you can see the whole view of Seoul There were interesting places to seefood to eatthings to buySurely a great place to visit I hope to be back
1650,5,If youre in Seoul YOU MUST go to the N Seoul Tower The view of the city is incredible It is the perfect instagram photo spot There is food at the top and it is fun to hang and people watch everyone at this tourist hot spot
1651,5,Must visit in any time of the dayThe Hello Kitty shop is super cute the love locks and basically all the area around is Amazing oh and of course dont forget the once in a lifetime view of the towers last floor Simply a must 
1652,4,Lots available Would be a great date spot where you could spend most of the day Different food options good little hike can opt for a cable car ride fun love lock location a kids area and just some nice nook and crannies to sit and enjoy
1653,4,N Seoul Observatory Deck showed us an amazing view of Namsan and Seoul It should be visited by tourist as it is known as one of the top tourist destinations in Seoul
1654,4,My kids enjoyed the N Seoul Tower and the Hello Kitty Island especially the latter The only really disappointing thing was that the grand piano did not work Maybe there should be a restaurant in the Hello Kitty Cafe
1655,4,I think it was worth the line and wait to go up to the to There are lots of fun things to see and do as well The tram up and down is such a unique experience highly recommend for anyone visiting Seoul
1656,4,Glad I visited now as the leaves of the trees are so greenmy favorite time to visit is at twilight the changing of colors outside while Im up there is really magical
1657,5,We had amazing view through N Seoul Tower and I love that you get to choose riding with fee of course or going through the stairs
1658,4,Nothing much to do up at the observatory level just enjoy the scenery and have some twosome coffee
1659,5,good experience top building  good service  good manner  good prepare  fast  quick  beautiful  amazing view
1660,5,We took the cable car up to the mountain the views were stunning there was much to see and the waiting time wasnt as bad as i expected took only about 5 mins on a Tue at 3PM highly would recommend the voucher redemption was easy as well the machines present had an English option
1661,4,Nice view at the top Stayed there for longer than expected Very good experience and easy to redeem redeem
1662,4,My second visit to N Seoul Tower was tons more comfortable than my first one as I didnt have to spend hours finding my way to the tower brief recap we got lost walked for almost an hour and ended up riding a bus This time we rode a bus and alighted at the towers lower entrance which meant that we had to hike uphill to reach the ground floor of the tower It was a bit of a climb but it provided for a beautiful view of the tower and its picturesque landscape We arrived just before sunset so everything was highlighted with a gorgeous golden hue background We were fortunate for clear skies during our observatory tower visit; however the views you get as you climb uphill or descend downhill prove to be more breathtaking than the one you get on the tower
1663,5,A must see for the sights as well as sounds on the path we spotted interesting birds and spiders Bring enough drinks stay hydrated Stop at the shop some cute crafts and stylish earings
1664,4,My mistake is to visit this popular attraction on a weekend evening When I arrived on Sunday at 940pm and got the ticket it showed the estimated waiting time to take the lift is 40 mins Examine the crowd Well the city view on top is nice with all the buildings and streets lights There is a small Hello Kitty museum separate ticket and a sweet shop on top The next pain is to queue and wait for the lift down I took a public bus back to Myeongdong around and was super tired by the time I reached my hotel past midnightThere are sites such as klook and kkday which offer discounted admission tickets to the tower and Hello Kitty museum
1665,4,The Seoul tower is more than a great view Its great fun for the whole family there a park in the area hello kitty mini park cheeseball adventure and plenty of wal trails to catch a view before the view To top it off you can get there by cable car that has it own wow view
1666,4,They seem to think this tower can compete with worldwide tall buildings Its laughably short but compared to the other buildings in the city it does provide a nice view of the city We did a beer and popcorn package but if you dont get it to take up we wanted to sit and enjoy you have to take a long trip back after the ride up and down
1667,4,Walked over to the cable cars from the hotel Took me a little while to find Only 10000 KRW 866 to go to the top Cheapest tower Ive ever been up Thursday afternoon and although it was not empty I certainly would not call it crowded Views were okay Difficult to find a clear day in Seoul this time of year I would definitely recommend it Lots more to do and see than just go up in the tower Best I can tell it is free to go to the tower And there are lots of great views and restaurants and shops at the base of the tower without paying to go up Several degrees cooler up there than it was down on the streets
1668,4,While there is a cost to go to the top the midlevels are fun with nice views and lots of entertainment going on during the day
1669,3,N Seoul Tower provides great views of the city on a clear day This is not our thing; ergo the rating There is a lot of activity in the tower and there are lots of peopleboth tourists and locals We suspect that it might be better to visit in the evening
1670,4,We kind of got a bit lost going up there because we had a misunderstanding with the bus driver So we took the cable car instead and fortunately it was not crowded and the ride up was nice You had to wait for a while for the elevator though but the view was really good You get a 360 degree view of the city lights There were lots of food stores below too if you get hungry And of course the there was the famous love lock Definitely worth a visit
1671,5,Namsan Tower AKA N Seoul Tower  Great place for a all round aerial view of Seoul  We took a walk up to the cable car station from Myeongdong Station Takes around 15mins  Remember to bring along your locks  or you can get one from the shops there Locks are pretty expensive there though  Nice and beautiful place overall
1672,5,There are many beautiful spots to see on the way leading to the tower There are the Locks of Love which are posted in and around the various fences of this area You can even buy your own padlock and leave a message on it and then lock it onto a post or wherever there was space There is also a kids play area stores for souvenirs or snacks obviously the observation tower statues and figures to take pictures of and many rest stops along the way Although the observation tower is a good view of the surrounding area you can also get the view when just looking from the view point areas from outside the tower which is free
1673,4,You can get great views from here but during peak times of the year it does get overcrowded But definitely worth going to at least once
1674,4,Went up by cable car was a very interesting experience  There are LOADS of locks couples put everywhere They put it on stair railings poles anywhere they possibly can Bring your own lock  We didnt buy a ticket up the tower The view from below was already amazing
1675,4,The N Seoul Tower is such a prominent landmark that you will just have to see it and the best time to go is before sunset  The light on the Tower is an indication of the current air quality from blue to red It was green normal air quality during our visit  Wed visited the tower as part of a half day tour From the bus station to the base of the Tower there is a steep slope going up leading to a viewing platform  The view from the observatory was stunning  you get a all around view of Seoul Even the mens toilet get a framed up views
1676,5,Like any other tall buildingattraction you go for the view I found N Tower to be less of a rip off than most of these types of places It was cool to ride the unmanned tram up a small hill to the cable car Views were great They do charge for the cable car as well as to go onto the observation deck and for photos but the price was reasonable Its a hike even with the tram and cable car so it was nice to do this towards sunset on a cooler day
1677,5,Use google map to take bus 402 etc Then alight at namsam library beside namsam park  Go to namsam park and go walk towards Seoul N tower
1678,4,We hiked up the mountain using a stairway path It was a hard hike But once we got to the top there were lots of things to do I think the coolest part was seeing all the locks of love at the top Theres a lot of restaurants up there and we went to Tokyo Steak which I highly recommend  If you go try to go on a clear day We went when it was overcast and a lot of pollution was trapped so the view of the city wasnt good at all
1679,4,If it is your first time in Seoul and would like to enjoy an aerial view of the city this is the place to go I would recommend going there late in the afternoon so you can enjoy the view when there is light until after dark so you get to see the city both during the day and at night There are several restaurants should you feel hungry and want to eat There is a convenience store for your basic needs If you are travelling with very small children and elderly it may be a challenge walking up the steep hill leading to the tower There is a portion there where there are trees where you can attach your lock as a remembrance until the next time you visit the tower The best way to reach the top is by car if not bus Taxis are not allowed so its a longer walk by cab If you go up there during the colder months of the year bring a jacket the cold is felt very much at that height
1680,3,Good view of Seoul but mostly building Went up observatory and came down to the car within 30 minutes
1681,5,Beautiful view and relaxing  up here On the way up here they have many cute coffee  shop and some good snack too  Best way to come up here from your hotel is Taxi 
1682,4,Well pretty much what youd expect  some great views some tacky but fun souvenirs etc Cable car ride is fun as is expected Nice territory to walk around as well
1683,4,Went here because I skipped it my past 2 visits to Seoul It was quite a hike from Myeongdong to the cable car station to bring us up the tower I forgot how much but around 9000 won roundtrip but its manageable After getting off the cable car you can already see colorful love locks all over; you can place your own If you dont have a lock they sell it there You can also take photos of the Tower from that area Then there is an option to pay to get up the N tower itself Since we didnt want to eat another buffet meal we only got the tickets with pizza and pasta meal for 2 not at the top of the tower though but the pizza especially was superb At the tower itself we didnt need to stay long; 1520 minutes was more than enough It was fun to play the interactive booth game though where you can say hi to people at the Busan tower 
1684,5,While the tower itself is like most viewing towers the whole experience is unique  You start from the walk up to the cable car centre Then there is the joy of taking the cable car up to the base of the tower Once you arrive on the other side there are lots of picture spots and also an area where couples place locks with their names written on it like in Paris  On the top of the tower you have a 360 degree view of Seoul from viewing platform There is this machine which is linked to the viewing tower located in Busan southern part of South Korea where you can interact with visitors who are there
1685,5,The view from observatory deck is fantastic It worth to visit It easy to access from itaewon by bus no 03 and from myeongdong bus no 05
1686,5,South korea is truly bless by nature You can ride or hike going to namsan tower It was spring when i came so the scenery is superb It best to travel during springsummeratumn
1687,4,My first trip there Good eye opener to see how this being built and its concept The weather was not good during our visit Could really see the outside view But with visiting The ticket price cheaper will be good
1688,4,Visited with a good colleague and he talked me into visiting on a day with good views It was fantastic; what an experience  On the square at the foot of the tower there are lots of activities
1689,4,Awesome site to see while in Korea Its a must see We went to the top and took pictures Theres even the little lock thing that people do You cant miss it theyre everywhere They sell them there so no worries about bringing your own I was told theyre love locks
1690,4,Was happy that our guide was able to drive us almost to the top where the views were good but because of the haze rather restricted distant views
1691,5,We visited at night and it was an amazing view The city stretches out in all directions It was also cute watching all the couples
1692,3,There is quite a bit to do at this location including many restaurants to have a meal However this attraction is at its best only when the weather is clear and the air is clear so you can see afar If the weather isnt so good than it would be a slight disappointing experience and you would miss out on seeing how Seoul is from top with the surrounding mini mountains
1693,5,I am thrilled to find cherry blossoms in here Good place for sightseeing and picturetaking although most of the time there were too many tourist in here
1694,4,Really beautiful we went during the day however I think at night would be spectacular Also dont go on a day where there is dust as the view isnt good on a day where there is a lot of pollution
1695,5,Must visit in Seoul Colder up there wear warmer clothes and gear specially if youre visiting from October to April
1696,5,For firsttime visitors and if sightseeing is an important agenda in your visit then you should definitely visit this place For starters it gives you a breathtaking view of Seoul and depending on visibility you can see nearby mountain ranges I assume that it also gives a very nice view at night where you can see the vibrant lights of Seoul City  If you are with your sweetheart you can also venture and put a lovelock here to show your affection to him or her Together with all the other lovebirds whove also done it before you
1697,3,Only stay up there for a short while Nothing fanciful Head straight to the ticket booth to purchase your ticket as you will be given a number and you got to wait for your number to be called
1698,4,I would recommend visiting this place during day time for better photo taking The hotel I stayed in Tmark Grand Hotel is very near to the tower and we got on a direct bus just in front of the hotel Easy and convenient The love lock area is always packed with tourists and quite difficult to find a nice spot to take pictures We only stayed for less than 3 hrs including a short coffee break
1699,4,Excited While we were in line for the cable car I thought it will only take us a few mins to hop in Not really  If you want to take the cable car it will be a very convenient journey to the topBut youll have to wait more than 30 mins looping around before you can even hop in I guess its a lot better than walking all the way to the top  I wish they had a warning downstairs before getting the ticket that we will have more 30 mins wait   We were excited for the sunset but we missed it Oh well The view was fantastic up there though
1700,4,Waited an hour to go up to the viewing deck that aside the views of Seoul are fantastic Worth the visit just take into consideration waiting times
1701,3,Seoul tower offers the most amazing  complete ariel view of the city unlike any other place However one needs to be careful before going up since if it is foggy then its a waste as you wont be able to see much Interesting fact  the tower itself uses lights to indicate whether the visibility is clear or not so its a good practice to watch for the lights and then make your way there You can get to the base of the tower for free which itself is good enough to get a splendid view But if you want to spend money you can pay more and make your way up the tower which as a restaurant with a better 360 view There are two ways to get there  you can trek your way up a nice path or take the bus The only downside is that it is super crowded and you need to jostle for space to get a decent view
1702,4,The cable car is fun and easiest way to look at Seoul The queue to get to the cable car is fast and the staff were helpful and attentive to old folks  Only thing is when we got off the cable car on top we need to climb three flights of stairs to get to the tower For people with accessibility issue or old folks like my dad they can take the lift behind the cable station Unfortunately the signage was not obvious and the lady behind the ticketing counter was not conversant in English We only realise when we were leaving the place
1703,4,We visited the tower at night hoping for a great view However it was foggy and we couldnt see a thing It was still a fun adventure
1704,4,Try to go from evening to night U get a nicer view of the city There is long queue but move quite fast
1705,3,Unsure if it was the time we went but the lines were HUGE We caught the elevator up to the cable car the cable car up to the tower and then the elevator to the observation deck There are quite a number of stairs and my poor Dad who has bad knees from an old sporting injury was hurting afterwards Its definitely a tourist trap you get up to the observation deck spend minimal time because its so crowded and then wait longer in the line to get back in the elevator to go back downstairs it hardly seems worth it Good to go once but wouldnt be high on my priority list to go again
1706,5,The Hop On  Off Bus makes a stop here Gorgeous view from the top It was a great day weather wise The tulips were in full bloom as well as the cherry blossoms  Dont forget to use the restroom inside at the top to take in another great view
1707,3,Limited interest as very touristic place with many fast food restaurants and gift shops  The panoramic view is nice by clear weather and you can really see the dimension of the city  To do if you have time to waste but not a must do
1708,5,I got here by subway than catch a shuttle bus no3 to come up here Be there around 330 pm I saw some traditional performance Then walk around the place I brought the eticket from tripcom got some discount The top of the observer floor you can see the Seoul city in 360 degrees make sure go down there on a clear day On the way down I walk to the Library direction very nice cherry blossoms trees the biggest tree I have ever seen
1709,5,On top of the tower one will be amazed by the size of this world city Its just incredible Really love to go here when I am in the city
1710,5,This place is totally worth going up to The 360 view of the city is fantastic There is plenty of room for everyone to get a view
1711,5,We rode the gondola to the top of the hill and enjoyed the views from Seoul Tower The souvenir shop and the teddy bear shop were favorites We hiked down and enjoyed the vistas along the way
1712,3,The only nice thing is rows of cherry blossom trees going up the to the place on the bus shuttle There are small shops selling ice cream and beverages at the outside of the tower
1713,3,We took the cable car to Namsan park It was a uphill climb to the cable car station The view at the lower deck is sufficient for us We did not go to the observation deck Be there early to avoid the crowds as there were bus loads of tourist when we left the place at around 11 plus There are three buses available at the bus stop which can bring you to selected train stations
1714,4,Well we do not choose to go up by skycab we walk up from Namsan park it was a right decision we made Namsan park is abeautiful park and nice place to see sunset we visited during the evening and when reach the N tower the night view of Namsan City really make us feel great in cold looking at the nice city night view feel like you empty your mind i think it is one of the best spot for city night view sightseeing in Seoul
1715,5,Nice view This is up at the top of a mountain The area has the Lovelocks corner where you see a lot of padlocks put by couples and you can even put one too Theres a store there selling love locks Theres also the beacons and the tower itself which you can go up using an elevator At the top the view is nice You get to see the city view There are also a lot of souvenir shops and food stalls at the top of the tower At the top is a little small so you may notice there are a lot of people beside you  Going to the location Make sure youre prepared to walk uphill here Maybe 1015 mins walk as the bus cant go up any higher Also make sure not to let your children run down this hill because one of the people in our tour group had let her children ran off and they came rolling downhill Good thing there were people who managed to catch the child But please be careful with your children going up or down the hill
1716,2,Sad impressions from the observation place with so dirty windows at a sunny week Forget abour taking professional photos here Enter price is cheaper online search on klook
1717,5,A cheap morning or afternoon activity thats allows you to appreciate the scale and density of the city that is Seoul  They run a tight ship here you are up top in no time  I recommend booing via Klook and simply scanning your pass at a machine to print a ticket; saves a line up
1718,5,This is a must visit place for couples friends families and even singles The place is full of love lock and the stores sell all these items Good to read what people write from all around the world Lots of tourists and locals Very good vibe
1719,5,Get your bearings for this vast city from the top Take the cable car up and a slow walk down with memorable views of the city Specially during spring blossom period
1720,5,The walk towards the tower may seem exhausting at first but once you get to the place and see the view of Seoul you regain all that drained energy  The view is definitely breathtaking   The only thing I disliked about it was that we were on a tour group so we had little time to savor the beautiful weather up there as well as the stunning view of the city Oh well there is always a next time 
1721,5,We visited the Namsan Tower as part of a voucher deal we purchased The walk up the mountain looked like a lovely and peaceful hike but not an easy climb therefore we took the easy route up via cable car Visit early in the morning to avoid the crowds however the view can still be obscured by morning mist so beware During the time we were in the observatory the mist partly cleared therefore we were rewarded with wonderful views The windows of the observatory tell you in which directly many cities are and the distance However we would of liked to have signs pointing out the Seoul landmarks such as bridges etc as we spent time trying to find these  The love locks are a beautiful attraction You dont need lock you padlock as soon as you see the main bulk of them on the walk up as there are places to lock them all over the site  A must do activity when visiting Seoul
1722,5,I usually shy from expensive tower attractions that involve several intervals lining up in queues Mid morning and midday really was not bad for the lines We had no more than 10 minute waits You absolutely MUST go to the bathroom as both genders have private bathroom views
1723,4,I It ride on the shuttle bus 5002 in dongdaemon station and from there it was just 15mins It was 10pm already when Ive got here but thanks to the management they still let me in and used my voucher I thought it was not crowded but there still a lot of tourist and locals are going here
1724,5,Fresh air and awesome view Staying up there in the morning with sunset is just beautiful Its a bit cold for this time but worth it You will have an overall view over Seoul
1725,4,N Seoul tower and the surrounding Namsan park and gardens provide a nice break from the busy city Enjoy a walk through the gardens up to the tower or take the cable car
1726,4,Nothing spectacular about the tower itself however on a clear day you can see all of Seoul and the surrounding areas and mountains It is a must to visit the toilets which have a clear glass wall and a wonderful View
1727,5,We took the bullet elevator all the way to the observation deck and it lasted only 38 seconds or less One would hardly feel it because theres a video showing on the ceiling while its going up The best part of being on the observation deck is the ladies comfort room One wall is entirely made of clear glass and youll see Seoul while you use the commode Weird but great experience We were also able to do the lovelocks and it was fun
1728,4,Great view good for tourist to spent time here D  Have variety of food too and money changer if u need
1729,5,You can ride the cable car from Myungdong near Sinsegae Dept store or ride city bus which is easier at the bus stop located just in front of from Namsan Hanok Village or Daehan Cinema at Chungmooro metro station
1730,4,My husband and I hiked up to Seoul Tower It was a bit of hike; however the result was great The view of the city was great even though it was a bit cloudy There are several restaurants to choose from Great for a few hours our of your day
1731,4,The second highest point in Seoul city this tower provides a gorgeous view of the city at night The observation deck at the top provides a dazzling cityscape from the glass windows and houses a souvenir shop While exiting the tower I also came across the row of Love Padlock trees and heart shaped chairs which seemed to be quite popular with the couples visiting the tower
1732,4,We went at night time and it was a lovely clear evening so the view was good You catch the cable car up If you are a senior 65 or over you get a discount The locks of love are there and there must be millions of them It should take you no more than an hour ago do this activity
1733,5,We are from the United States so were not able to really plan this visit around the weather If you go be sure to go on a clear day We were lucky to have great visibility the day we went The locks of love was great as well We had no idea about it before going and were able to participate in it by adding a lock for us Worth going for sure
1734,4,Ive been here twice once in the evening and once in the day From the entrance to the tower you can appreciate the cityscape of Seoul and its a great view It doesnt cost much to go up the tower only 10000 KRW per person plus there is a bundle of 2 popcorns  2 beers for 26000 KRW which we availed of The top of the tower itself was quite small in terms of circumference Only housing a candy store and a souvenir shop were located at the main viewing deck with a nonadvertised coffee shop at the lower floor which we wouldve gone to and stayed at if we had only known theyre the only accessible nonrestaurant establishment with seats It was a great experience but its more than enough to go up the tower once no need to do it again and again
1735,3,Im sure the views would be nice if it werent for the smog 360 views of the city available Avoid the souvenir shop Utter rip off Was charged 9500 won x 4 for four cards to send to folks back home Thats almost 40 USD Im honestly horrified that they charge such prices but promised some folks I would send a card Never again
1736,5,Although the queue is quite long but on the top of the tower the 360 degree view is just fantastic Beautiful place for sunset
1737,5,We went on a nice sunny clear day and were able to see all around the city I recommend getting the beer and popcorn adult package you can take it up with you
1738,4,You can get a good view of Seoul at both the bottom and the top That is because the tower is located on a mountain that is at one of the highest points in Seoul Walking up the mountain is a nice way to get there but there are also buses from Seoul Station to get to the top of the mountain
1739,4,Went to N Seoul Tower for the 3rd time alreadynever fails to amaze me My faves there are visiting the Hello Kitty Island  the Locks of Love So easy to go there from Myeongdong just ride Bus 05 Always enjoyed my experience in N Seoul Tower Till next time
1740,4,Got up at 530an to hike from Meyongdong to the top Amazing views along the way Very physically draining You will need to be pretty fit to make Well worth it when you get to the top Took me an hour up and 30 mins down Which included breaks to take photos Cable car wasnt working when I was there but I still would have walked as it didnt open till later Lots of CCTV cameras so felt safe in the dark
1741,5,This could be a very romantic place to visit Views are great although it was extremely hazy on the day we visited Not sure how it looks at night but I bet its very nice You can hike up or take the cable car Its definitely a worthwhile visit while in Seoul
1742,4,My family of 4 stayed near Seoul Tower and made the mistake of choosing to walk to the tower From the map we are just less than 800m away to the tower But the walk to the tower took us nearly an hour The 1st part was just a uphill walk quite tiring but managable The 2nd part are mostly steps We saw lots of cars parking at the end of the 1st part and some cars parked at the tower From some reviews we gathered there is a bus which we could have taken  The view on top was great The space at the observatory is not big and I was surprised to see quite a no of people  There are quite a few restaurants and cafes at the tower We went to Owls Cutlet and the food was great
1743,3,we took the Namsan Circular Bus yellow bus no 05 up to the top of the mountain it was the cheapest mode to get there other than hiking up on your own the view from the namsan mountain was spectacular
1744,5,Having visited quite a number of these towers this is by far the best The tower itself is not as tallest but the atmosphere within and around is unbeatable The endless number of padlocks and viewpoints make this a special place Once up the tower you get great views of the city You can easily spend 23 hours here
1745,5,Seoul Tower or N Seoul Tower is one of the most romantic attractions that many couples have The couple must come to lock the keys together And also has a beautiful view point Have convenient travel The entrance fee is not expensive People are friendly cute and Has a very clean place
1746,5,N Seoul Tower is one of the major tourist attractions of Seoul Considered one of the most beautiful towers in Asia Is a place that has beautiful and varied lighting There is a restaurant on the tower that will turn around every 48 minutes named N Grill When going up to the tower to see the beautiful scenery
1747,4,if you have been to other higher places in world this doesnt give you that adrenaline rush bt still its good for one time visit and those love locks are good for romantic evenings
1748,5,Actual fact is a quite romantic tower to go especially for couples who want to lock their love up on the tower Is beautiful view from the top and breathtaking too
1749,5,We loved our time climbing from Meong Dong to the tower great to make you feel warm as the snow just fell the night before We loved the view and the landscape
1750,4,I love the cable car ride to the top of the mountain I love the magnificent view of Seoul from the mountain The tower is interesting and sell many things from food to souvenirs
1751,5,Every previous visit to Seoul had been cloudy or rainy meaning the tower was not good to visit This time was a beautiful sunny day and worth the visit  We went up to the tower in the cable car which was fun in itself
1752,4,Overlooking Seoul at N seoul tower despite the very cold weather the place the viewthe scenery was beautiful There were restaurants as well to chill out until nighttime And couples lock their padlock of love onto the railing and to dream that their love will last forever
1753,3,I visited Seoul tower with my friends Its just the view from the tower But due to glass reflection was not able to click good pics Just an average place
1754,3,One of the place that I looked forward so much but ended up being so disappointed It did not appear as charming and nice as my expectation Ticket is a little on the pricier side as well but the hike up to the N tower was worth it the view of Seoul from above is just breathtaking
1755,3,Built on a mountain Seoul tower is a quite high place in Seoul People can see the skyline of Seoul and enjoy the food meanwhile However I have to admit I prefer the skyline of Tokyo or Hong Kong There are no so many skyscrapers in Seoul compared with the two cities Also It is a little far away from the highest skyscrapers like lotte world tower So I dont think there may be best places to see the seoul skyline People can arrive at the tower by the cable car instead of climbing the mountain
1756,5,Visited Seoul tower at nite and presented with delightful displace of light show bathing the tower and lights from surrounding structures down below Mesmerising
1757,3,Timing is everything it seems when it comes to visiting outdoor attractions in the winter During my visit to Seoul in February I enjoyed some spectacular clear and sunny days However on those good viewing days my schedule would not permit a visit here to the N Seoul Tower located within Namsan Park here in Seoul South Korea Then I looked into taking a tour to the N Seoul Tower The price was prohibitive However the booking agent for the tour told me that their bus would go to the base of the N Seoul Tower My friends who live here said that you have to walk up a long walk to get to the base of the tower  So I hired a taxi and off we went on a dark gray overcast and snowy day to see the N Seoul Tower I expected the taxi would take me to the top to the base of the tower This was not the case at all I saw the snow covered walk leading up a hill and had to decline a visit  Disappointing Yes indeed But my timing was lousy and I had to be at the airport and wont have another chance to visit the N Seoul Tower until who knows when  What is the point of this review I strongly recommend that you DO NOT OPT TO VIEW THE N Seoul Tower on an day with inclement weather
1758,5,This is a wonderful place from which to view Seoul We enjoyed strolling the grounds taking in the views trying some virtual reality seeing all the love locks and then taking the elevator up the tower Do make a reservation if you want to eat at one of the two real restaurants otherwise you can get a wonderful burger or coffeedessert at one the selfserve type spots Walking down the path at night was lovelyseeing the city lit up at night was just beauriful Not exactly accessible for those with mobility challenges
1759,4,Short waiting time A bit steep and Im not sure its suutable for people with a disability in parts  Cracking views
1760,5,very nice view by the way on top of the hill some small kiosks with refreshing drink and food easy access
1761,3,Queues for 1 hour to boardand the cable car with people cutting queues A better system could be in place
1762,5,Had a great trip to N Seoul tower We walked all the way to Shinsegae mall turned left and walked about 5 mins we took the elevator provided Because it was freezing so we gave up walking up the hill all the way to the tower we took the cable car instead The view was spectacular especially during the winter We brought our own keypad lock because theyre selling for much a higher price at the tower Overall the experience was great and we enjoyed it
1763,4,We took the cable cart up to N Seoul Tower We didnt actually go inside however just walked around took in the spectacular views We then chose to walk back down and not take the cable car down as we enjoy walking It was a nice walk and along the way there was a cool free workout park there was multiple bench press sit up benches weight machines etc We stopped and did a 45 minute workout before continuing back down the hill
1764,5,The views from the tower is amazing birds eye view of the city At night the city looks spectacular Loads of restaurants and shops and the sunset from there is beautiful
1765,2,Im not quite sure what all the fuss is about We had to do an uphill walk to the base of the cable car for 10 each then pay another 10 each to go up the observatory which essentially gives you a city view not unlike any other big cities Lots of stairs and walking not worth the effort
1766,5,Good place to see Seoul 360 degree Not a crowded place even during Christmas period Will go again in different seasons
1767,4,Nice sunny day so we got good 360 view of Seoul Went there on Friday morning so it was not that crowded We took bus 02 from Hanok Village which took us directly up to N Seoul Tower and later took bus 03 which took us to our next destination which was Itaewon Very convenient
1768,4,Went there to celebrate my birthday Fees for cable car observatory deck and other attractions are quite expensive however your Seoul tour wont be complete if you dont go to this famous tower
1769,3,From Myeongdong subway station you can easily walk your way up a steep road to the cable car station that will bring you up the tower The cable car comes in frequency of 10 minutes and will be filled to its max capacity with people  My family went in the evening and saw the sunset Also the good part about going in the evening is that you get to see the day view  also the night view  Objectively I do not find the view from the top especially amazing But nonetheless still scenic I am guessing most people go to seeput their couple lock There is a mall there that sells souveniors food and other things too
1770,5,We went up to the observatory in 30 seconds we can viewing 360 degree city blue house yeouido hanriver and many bridge on river too I taken many pictures at there I was veteran and I also got discount on admission fees I was sorry that I could not take night tour I would like to have a night tour at next opportunity
1771,3,Dubbed as the mustsee site in Seoul and a part of all tour packages the tower seems to be overrated Packed with a lot of tourists long waiting line Btw it does offer a great view of Seoul by night
1772,5,The Seoul Tower is an absolute must particularly at night It gives you a 360 degree view of the city with its brilliant twinkling lights The signs that indicate what cities lay in which direction are helpful in establishing your spot in the world Its a treat
1773,3,I think I will never visit N Seoul Tower again at least not on holiday evenings  Reason 1 terrible waiting time spent 20 minutes for the escalator up to the cable car ticket booth 80 minutes for getting the cable car tickets and getting on the cable car 30 minutes for entering the tower  They limited and controlled the total numbers of visitors up on the bird view area In a word it took me more than two hours to get to the bird view area  Reason 2 poor quality of viewing  On the windows were stains left by visitors Besides the reflection from the lights of the stores were annoying  I have no idea whether a daytime visit during week days will be pleasant or not However Im sure I wouldnt like to visit N Seoul Tower on holiday evenings again
1774,5,Not suitable for elderly people that cant walk far and up the hill The parking space for vehicles are way down the hill But its a beautiful place if its not raining and foggy
1775,5,We went there before sunset and manage to see Seoul from above coming alove with the lovely lights Plenty of beautiful photo worthy shots in the changing light
1776,4,Nice veiw over Seoul but a very long wait for the elevator Visit the skybar and enjoy the veiw It must have been one of the most expensive touristattractions in Seoul Still worth a visit
1777,4,enjoying the sights of Seoul city from a height is the icon of Seoul city the love padlock is an attraction for tourists visiting here facilities available both even for parents and even pregnant women because there is a cable car available
1778,4,If you are couple dont forget to bring lock or you can buy it upstairs Buy the lock at the entrance of cable car will be cheaper then upstairs  I went there through cable car Its great and enough for me We dont go to the top of the tower  But playing around at the bottom is enough at least for me there are several restaurant that you can choose
1779,3,I went here with a couple of my local friends the queue though omgosh We went there around 7pm and the queue was superrrr long I dont think Im gonna revisit The view at night is nice but I wont spend Another hours standing in long queue like that for just looking at Seouls view at night
1780,4,You must go there and remind you to try the lunch buffet at the lower level The price is very good Just around 16 in the Canadian dollar The other lunch buffet is double this price Please try to go there on a sunny day when the view is good too
1781,5,Stunning view from the top A little bit expensive for me Food is also good Things selling here is pricey
1782,3,We came here in the evening on a Friday night and it was crowded Theres also no taxis that we could take to go back to our hotel  because we had been on a DMZ tour that day  just want to get back to the hotel as soon as we could I think it would be better to come here during the day
1783,5,N Seoul Tower is an excellent place to visit with family and friends for any occasion because offers a great view day and night to the city of Seoul The Tower is on top of a mountain and allows the opportunity to go for a walk and observe a large forest around the mountain plus having a delicious treat before going to the top of the Tower Once on top of the Tower you can take some pictures of the city and buy some souvenirs
1784,4,You can walk to the tower but its hard up hillwe got the cable car with was 9500won each but well worth it before you go up the tower you can take nice photos of seoulit costs 10000won each to get the lift to the top of the towerthe views are great seeing all seoul right back to the mountainsyou can walk round the platform 360degreethere are lots of shops cafe and places to eat but a little bit priceyit would be hard for a wheelchairbut a must thing to do if your in seoul
1785,5,Been visiting Korea for two consecutive years and wasnt able to visit this top spot in Korea snd frlt the need to come back and see this beauty so I did not want to miss seeing this the second time and I love it Very picturesque
1786,4,I spent 24 hours in Seoul and this was the first place I went It was night and really cold but the view is good you can see quite a lot of Seoul and the surrounding area Its a very popular place and there are lines to do basically everything like take the cable car to the top of the park take the elevator up to the observation deck in the tower and take the elevator back down
1787,4,This is quite a nice place to visit Taking cable car one can view Seoul areas If you are challenging I would suggest you to walk down in order to appreciate more about Seoul However the best time to visit this place is evening after 4pm when the sun on the other side and you can take beautiful pictures Enjoy
1788,5,Cable car return tickets cost 8500 won per person and entrance fee to the actual tower was an additional 10000 won per person The elevator had an entertaining projection on the ceiling while going up for 30 seconds The views from the top of the hill are definitely worth it because Seoul is a clean and attractive easy to look at city The windows of the observation deck have names of other world cities and distances to them so you can have your photos taken by your home name Even the toilet cubicles have a view The restaurants at the observation deck are overpriced so just wait until you go out to the terrace where there are several coffee shops ice creamery and a couple of average restaurants We spent some 2 hours all in all Better to buy a one way cable car ticket and walk down the nice paved path
1789,4,Visited this place as part of a tour package and spent about 1 hour here The view from Seoul tower is amazing and we were lucky as it was a clear day  The elevator had a nice ceiling video while bringing us up and down Worth a visit if you are nearby
1790,4,It takes about 1015mins walk from Myeongdong to reach the elevator which will bring up to the cable car station The cost for round trip for cable car was 8000krw Upon reaching the top of the hill you could decide if you want to go up the tower Even if you decide not to go up you will still get a good view and there are lots of places for taking photos Just like most of the towers you get panoramic view of the city at the top of the tower The ride up the tower was interesting with the display on the ceiling of the elevator
1791,4,The N Seoul Tower is a very touristy spot on top of a hill but even though its quite expensive Id recommend it to everyone The place is especially nice for couples because there is a spot where you can buy love locks and hang them up for good luck in a relationship Was nice and Id definetly recommend it for couples
1792,5,Spend my time at the Seoul towera lot of places you can go once you reached on top via the cable carNice view Reccomended for all
1793,5,You can pay for the cable car round trip or one way or you can ride the bus to and fro the tower The cable car is nothing special but it is very convenient We enjoyed N Seoul tower the view the locks the open space and especially the free hanbok wearing
1794,4,We visited this place during winter and I honestly dont have a feel for shopping that time because it was too cold for asian born in tropical country The best thing that you can do here during winter is to have a taste of its street foods
1795,4,We took a bus up to the mountain followed by a stroll up the slope to the tower We could view the city not only from the observatory deck but also from the toilet while doing business Its interesting Once done going round seeing city from all angles you could order a cup of coffee sit by the window and enjoy the drink plus views Very relaxing The sight of love locks makes you wonder why people locked their love there Isnt that 
1796,4,We made journey but it was worth it They view is phenomenal especially at night seeing the palaces lighten up Very polite people who were guides Advise anybody that is going to wear sneakers It is a good hike
1797,5,I personally think the visit is worth the price Had a hotel in Myeongdong so all I had to do was to take a lift to the cable car place You should visit when the sun is setting so youll see Seoul during night dusk and day The inside of the tower is really crowded during that time though You can send postcards directly from the tower which I recommend
1798,5,I think Seoul is an identical metropolis It is green  not tall city like suburban or something like that But it is really a metro  full of many transportation and technology Actually I dont like to pay for climbing to see view in high rises like this And some time it was disappointment This time I had read reviews in this Tripadvisor and finally went to From above  you will see this green metropolis clearly It was beautiful In fact the ticket for transportation itself is not expensive But if you want to challenge yoursef  you may climb to the base of the tower with your own feet
1799,5,favourite part were the love locks  i loved being so high up and the view was so beautiful spent 3 hours taking beautiful pictures here
1800,5,There is a currency exchange machine located behind the Twosome Coffee and beside the restroom  Reminder You need to bring your passport because they will scan it for the limit amount you can only exchange I dont actually know how they do this Wow Korea  The rate is higher than the ones we found at the Incheon International Airport ie 93993950 Airport 10005 N Seoul Tower
1801,3,The experience was great but the cable car ride only gets you to the bottom of the tower and then you have to pay again to go to the top of the tower We only ride the cable car because we waited 45 minutes to ride and then it was going to be another 70 minute wait to ride to the top of the tower
1802,5,Entering the structure through a LED tunnel was amazing Going up the observatory through the elevator was an experience itself with the short video clip watched on the elevator ceiling The whole of Seoul can be seen at every level of the tower but best at the observatory and even through the bathroom A mustvisit place in Seoul
1803,4,We took a short cable car to the base of the tower since we had a stroller but it would be a nice walk We did not go up into the tower but the base was a large park area with nice views of the city and mountains
1804,5,Had an ir temp handheld for this trip First time to get a headache from the weather haha Kids love it  just be sure to be prepared especially if reaching night time Ate at n burger for dinner 
1805,4,This area is walking distance from the Myeongdong area about 1520 mins You then have the option to ride a cable car up or to walk up to the Tower The cable car is just a few minute ride so we opted to walk It takes about 30 minutes to walk up much longer for us as we kept stopping to take pictures of the view  We did not enter the tower itself there is a fee but we enjoyed the scenery at the top There are some restaurants at the bottom of the tower
1806,4,There was a performance at the plaza area outside near the gift shop where they let spectators try their hand at piercing a bamboo with a spear Everyone laughed when the warrior the staff haha gasped in awe as one of the ladies managed to pierce it successfully D He had helped her wedge the bamboo before that On an unrelated note the gift shop staff was very stingy with their carrier bag I know they dont have a culture of giving plastic bags but its a gift shop at a tourist spot right
1807,4,We booked the tickets to the observatory tower at N Seoul Tower through Klook as its cost around SGD650pax much cheaper when compared to purchase onsite If travelling by taxis you have to stop at the cable car ticket booth and travelled up by cable car or by bus Its better to reach around 10am to avoid crowd as the queue for cable car can be long After getting off the cable car please proceed to B1 of observatory tower to print your ticket using Klook barcode issued to you We spent less than 30 mins at Observatory Tower as its very small and crowded I feels this can give a miss The lovelocked area is good enough for you to walk around and take some decent photos of the views
1808,3,Good views only if the smog and pollution have cleared out Go after a big rain Buses go to the top but the is no car parking at the top There is also a crowded cable car that will take you up to the top
1809,5,It was amazing The cable car was smooth ride We also tried the stairs even though its high The park is nicely clean and the flowers were beautiful and colourful The people were friendly and nice to talk to I highly recommend this place for people who will visit Seoul Korea Top list
1810,3,Wasnt prepared to walk 20 to 30 minutes uphill to reach the cable car station The station was very packed with 2 car rotating Quite slow and packed really packed  The view was fantastis especially it is winter time cool off the tireness from walking all the way up
1811,4,You can see Namsan Tower from standing everywhere in Seoul its that huge and built on a slope We went to the very top of this tower which provides a beautiful 360 degree view of Seoul South Korea Another thing that Namsan tower is famous for is locking love locks There must be million of colorful locks
1812,5,Good place for memories taking photos  have coffee shop and small restaurant you can see nice view of Seoul from there easy access by bus 030504 have 5 floors as well as the shiny lock you can buy lock twin and place it there for good luck in relation thats ver romantic
1813,3,This tower is pretty much the same as any tower you find throughout your travels The unique thing about it is around it Leading up to the tower are hundreds of locks with couples names on them that are locked on the guard railings There are some restrictions for those putting theirs up and if you dont follow their rules your lock will be removed at the end of the night Good view from the tower of the City but like every other tourist stop a bit over priced Entrance fee is separate from the cable car ride getting there
1814,4,Namsan Tower is one of the key place that my daughter wants to go Watching the drama Deep Blue Sea with Lee min ho drives her crazy for visiting Seoul Its quite a climb after the bus dropped us Wish the bus can reach nearer to the tower Itll be quite tough for the child or elderly to climb up But the view is worth it Had a great time here
1815,5,We got the cable car up to the tower and it was incredible seeing the while of seoul  the tower its self was very busy with a large school trip when we were there but still its plenty big enough the locks are amazing there is so many I could have spent all day reading them 
1816,5,I recommend doing this in the evening you see the whole of Seoul lit up Its an amazing view definitely worth seeing
1817,5,This tower also known as the Namsan Tower is located on the second highest land point within the Greater Seoul area located on the north side of the river It was built in 1971 and is 236 metres high It was built primarily as a communications tower but with lookout facilites restaurants souvenir shops etc included within the design  My partner and I just happened to be staying at a hotel that was within walking distance 10 minutes which is how we made our way to it via SogongRo road on the north side which then proceeds into a freeway tunnel into the hill beneath the tower and its surrounds Just before the tunnel and on the northeastern side we unexpectedly discovered that there is a cablecar that takes you from the aforementioned road level up to the very large park that surrounds the actual tower itself This saves you a somewhat steep walk up to the tower park but if youre into exercise then by all means skip this free ride and walk up instead Its quite steep  There is also road access to the tower and surrounding park that comes in from the south and I assume that you can get a cab up and there are many coach day tours that can also get you to this park and the tower  There is a LOT to see in the surrounding park even before you decide to take the lift up the tower itself The landscaped area surrounding the tower has many restaurants fast food outlets souvenir shops and lookout platformsThe views even just from these large viewing platforms is very impressive and you can spend an hour or more here depending on whether there are special events displays andor entertainment on the day of your visit before you even consider taking the lift up to the top of the tower itself  But the main purpose of your visit still must include a ride in the fast vertical lifts to the tower viewing platforms where you get a 360degree view of Seoul Quite spectacular Again shops and food outlets on this high viewing platform  And I can only speak for the male visitors DO make a point of visiting the male toilets here Men you can stand at a narrow urinal against what is effectively a glass wall and take in the stunning views of Seoul as you relax and relieve and even taking photographs from the mens toilets are encouraged  A visit to the N Seoul Tower should be a mandatory port of call if you have never visited Seoul before
1818,5,The family enjoyed the tower and had dinner just outside overlooking the city We went a second time to see the sunset
1819,5,What beautiful views of the city that just keeps going We made a half days of it We hiked a little took the tram ate lunch looking over the city and then added a lock to the already thousands placed there Took some amazing photos too My toddlers loved all the colorful locks and the lock trees and the tram
1820,4,Perched comfortably atop the Namsan mountain this tower provides unparalleled views of the Seoul metro area One can get to the observation deck in USD 10 and you can also add some combos which include lunch plus drink sets  Accessible by cable car from Myeongdong or by public Bus or even you a mild 30minute hike Look out for the special beacon fire lighting ceremony dates to make your visit even more rewarding
1821,4,Visiting N tower marked my presence at the very spot where my fav drama was filmed 3  It was a lovely walk up the hill and once we were up there we got a gorgeous view of autumn leaves and the big city laid right down below
1822,4,I took a bus up and enjoyed the views and the place totally I do not see a point in buying a ticket to enter the tower Nonetheless I enjoyed every corner of Namsam Theres a cultural show from 34 pm everyday except Mondays I chose to take a walk down which took me 30 mins but the views were great
1823,3,Driving here Car park goes 34 way up to the hill to the Lookout  This has a tower atop but the free to look version was adequate to us A 360  of Seoul the view from the tower should be more far reaching but it was mistycloudy thuscouldnt be bothered to go up Yes  it was a view of the city 4pm so it wasnt a striking sight as there were no lights to hilite the scene A padlockfence where U purchase a plock costs money and add to the collection of numerous otherswho were expounding undying love to someone NOT ME There were movie characters and others for foto shoot opportunities Food and souvenirs were available for purchase Toilets available free To me it was a BEEN THERE DONE THAT As friend saidbrought us here because it was expected Came at wrong time dont know if open at nite How long the visit depending upon the individual me twenty mins enough Wheel chair access would be difficult because of the uphill push and downhill hold
1824,5,Here too many people using cable car on queue so I only walk to Tower takes 12 hour Ohhh so tired please bring your water Beautiful places and blossoms For couples and families can buy key worth 15 inside shopping area There you can see many keys
1825,3,an ordinary experience apart from the extraordinary view of the city the restaurant is not at the price and everything was too commercial starting from the padlocks of the lovers I bought a beautiful t shirt
1826,4,We went there at night But i guess the view during the nighttime is better because of the amazing lights Its just very chilly We had to walk from the foot of the hill to the Seoul Tower entrance And its December so its expected to be cold Just prepare warm coats
1827,3,For 10000 won experience it was ok generally But at the queue you will have to take a mandatory shoot  select your desired photo once you reached the top The lift queue was a torture for me as it was stuffy and took some time before you could take the lift up full of tourists and tour groups The view was magnificient too as it was near sunset when we wentand too many people trying to get a good picture everywhere Then the tragedy began when you need to head back downthe lift queue was super long Took us almost half an hour to get down Then at the 1st floor its where you will visit the Love Locks galleryand thats about all for this famous N Seoul Tower all you see on K Dramas 
1828,5,We got the tickets that included the meal in the Hancook Restaurant The view was great and the food was excellent Even when youre in the toilet the view was great Its a bit pricey but I think it was worth it
1829,4,The place to go to see Seoul city from a higher view point The grounds where the tower base itself is located is already high enough to see great views of Seoul however you could also go up the tower for an unobstructed 360 view Recommend going in the evening as the sun is about to set to see both views when it is still light and as the lights fill the city as the night darkens
1830,4,You need to pay if you want to go on top of the tower However you can still able to take nice photo from the lower deck of the tower without going up Nice place to visit in Seoul Many buses go to Namsan Tower and it just within 10mins walk from the bus stop to the entrance of Namsan Tower
1831,5,Though you have another tower to visit this tower is so lovely please visit you can take public transport so easy and well connected spend sometime there go with family or close friends
1832,4,This is one of the must visit place in Seoul We took a private tour to get there The weather was sunny and cold Managed to see clear and beautiful city skyline Recommend place to visit
1833,4,Make sure you go on a day with good visibility  The tower is commercial shopping and touristy but if you ignore that and enjoy the views its a great location make sure to check out the bathrooms at the top
1834,4,Must visit the Seoul tower while in Seoul The views from the top is beautiful and you can see the whole Seoul from there Its beautiful especially at night You can take the cable car to the top if you dont want to walk Its about 1 mile walking to the tower
1835,5,This is the place is really tremendous and famous in Korea I hope we will not miss the chance of visiting such a beautiful place
1836,3,There are a few viewpoints for this tower The view from the lower level and the top of the tower are roughly similiar Dont think you need to pay extra to go all the way to the top of the tower
1837,5,Climbing up the uphill landscape towards Namsan is totally worth every step It was one of the most beautiful sights that I have ever seen in my whole life The night lights of the city are like stars that brings everything to life They carry a vibrancy and serenity at the same time We were literally huffing and puffing on our way up on a cold and windy autumn night But all the huffing and puffing didnt really matter when got to take a look of the beautiful gift that Namsan gave us My sister and I literally just stood in there for quite sometime taking in the magnificence of the view On our right the Seoul city view and to our left the majestic N Seoul Tower It was a perfect night to end our first day in Korea We also got to have a picture where Cha Taehyun posed for a picture for The Seollal Episode in 2 days and 1 night Fun fact Our guide told us that if the tower in lit Green meaning the atmosphere is clear of the microdirt and the air is clean Other colors such as blue and red indicates a different reading On our way down wind blew and ginko leaves fell adding to the serene ambiance Definitely worth hiking
1838,3,The observation deck was relatively expensive if only for 360 view of Seoul I enjoyed the The Love Chair and Padlock area it seem to bring couples much closer together
1839,4,Spent the day hiking and visiting the N Seoul Tower  GETTING THERE Yes there is a cable car But the hike is very easy  its reasonably flat and you get pretty good views all the way up Once at the tower you need to buy a ticket to go to the observation deck There is a shopping mall below so choose to visit that either before or after the observation deck Then you join the queue get your photo taken optional and then take the lift to the top Once at the top there are three different floors full of restaurants and shops  Tip If you have Lonely Planet they have an excellent selfguided walking tour thats very easy to do It includes a visit to the Old City Wall  CROWDS Its so crowded Be prepared to wait 1015 minutes in queues for food shops and finding a spot to take photos  VIEWS Incredible  Tip Want to get good views but be away from crowds We went to the Hancook restaurant where it was VERY quiet We then sat there ate slowly and watched the sunset from our own table in our own space Its much better then nudging people out of the way on the main floors  FOOD First we got beer  chips from a coffee shop and the chips were laughably bad Then we went and hid in the Hancook restaurant which was a little overpriced but nice and quiet We got our own table overlooking the city  SOUVENIR SHOPPING Some of the best souvenirs Ive seen in Seoul Did all my shopping there
1840,5,N Seoul Tower is worth a visit You can pay to go to the top or just enjoy the views from the many free viewing platforms lower down or within the park itself There is plenty going on day and night with organised performances or just people hanging out taking photos in the different areas The all you can eat buffet is excellent value before 5pm when the price increases significantly A good day out for those on a budget
1841,4,It is a good experience for the family especially with kids and the love lock on the N Korea Tower Very affordable Walk up to the tower and then use the free elevator to come down from mountain to street level
1842,5,I generally skip towers when I visit new places because I have been to so many and they tend to be just waiting in line going up for two seconds and then going back down This one was a much nicer experience There is a cafe at the top and you can kind of hang out for a bit Also the area at the bottom of the tower was really nice and had great views as well
1843,2,The N Seoul Tower is an iconic landmark located on Namsan Mountain in central Seoul Its a tower you cen get some good views across the city weather allowing but sadly thats as good as it gets The main building itself is tired and could really do with a lick of paint and some TLC It has the usual complement of tourist gift shops but better and cheaper items can be located in Seouls many and various shopping areas It has a fair number of food outlets and restaurants but again these are nothing special There are plenty possibly too many places to purchase love locks and plenty of places to secure them to the building as a way of declaring you love Positives Well the mountain park surrounding the tower is pleasant and offers gentle walks and nice views
1844,5,Romantic place to visit You can find many photo spots here especially the lock bridge Many dramas have taken scenes here also  The admission fee is moderate around 10000Won less expensive than Lotte Tower Worth to visit while you are in SK  My advice is visit this place when the weather is clear unless you want see foggy Seoul
1845,5,A must trip to get a perspective of the citys density river and mountains Get there early to see the sunset you wont be disappointed You can get there by public transportation and take the combination elevator cable car or hike up
1846,5,Went to check the tower just because thinking its just like any other landmark tower Proved myself wrong because the park is actually a great place to hangout and have a picnic Views of the city is breathtaking Theres a lot to do in the park and includes hiking
1847,4,So instead of taking the cable car we did the mini hike up This way we were able to see the N Tower in different distances The entry fee is not too expensive especially when you get it with a combo drink with popcorn the wait to go in isnt that long just go within your number The wait to go down the elevators was sooo long though Id say similar to all other towers in Asia if youve been to any like Tokyo or Taipei Its all very similar just not as tall Its not a must but since its a landmark we just went
1848,5,This is good place for any type of tourists but there is a special place for lovers There is place where you could buy suveniours and another place where you could buy a lock and place it on a place and lock it for your partner or lover
1849,5,If you go to Namsan Tower on the weekend ull see a lot people there I recommend u to come here at fall because the weathers good and the view really good  Untuk mencapai Tower nya bisa naik cable car atau jalan kaki ya Tahun lalu aku jalan kaki dan jujur sangat melelahkan jadi ga aku saranin hehe
1850,5,You must see this tower and the park nearby you must see the city from very top there and fall in love with it
1851,4,There are two ways to get to N Seoul Tower  via cable car or by foot We went for the latter It was less than 10 degrees but we were sweating haha I lost track of how many stairs there was but it took as approximately almosg an hour to reach the destination Although it was very tiring like really our legs were so sore after but the view while on our way is breathtaking You can see the beauty of Seoul at night As of November 2018 the cable car costs 9000KRW round trip or 7000KRW one way Either is ok depends on you and your time
1852,3,Way too crowded by local and tourist Have to queue pretty long to get in the elevator for going both up and down the observatory tower Somehow its worth the walk for namsam park and the city night scene
1853,5,We came here at late afternoon It had a beautiful birds eyeview of Seoul I imagine the view would be even more beautiful at night  For those who do not want to get tired walking up there is a free roundtrip shuttle from Seoul Station and Myeongdong From the shuttle stop in Namsan Park you can take the cable car to the tower
1854,4,Last time we visited and dine there at night This time we visited there in the afternoon for a different feel  view    Under a very good weather the Tower trees  leaves environment are spectacular    See the photos I posted to feel what we felt  
1855,5,Long steep climb to the tower Decided not to take the cable car Well lit walkway and stairs Restroom stop part way up The view is spectacular Went at night so lots of lights Enjoyed popcorn and beer for two while waiting for the elevator Convenient wait for your number to go up Very long line going back down
1856,5,Its super touristic but definitly a thing to do in Seoul The view is wonderfull  I recommend to go around sunset so you can see the view by day and night I have the feeling that you can take better pictures from the nightview outside instead of in the tower due to reflection from the lights in the tower
1857,5,We had a great day walking and putting our lock at the tower They have places to get snacks and an arcade my son loved Spend a half day here at minimum
1858,5,My partner and I went to the N Soeul Tower in the afternoon and stayed until night so we could take a lot of pictures You can go there by walking through the Namsan Park cable car or by bus We took the cable car It was a nice experience Even the toilet has a great view of the city Also the Roof terrace of locks of love was nice We bought a love lock and lock our love there Next time when we visit Seoul we will visit Namsan Park
1859,3,It looks like the visit to this site is always part of the tour package We arrived in the evening and the view at the site was good Its now not the highest tower as most countries trying to compete to build tallest towers The 360 degree view was interesting
1860,3,Gives widespread view of Seoul Rather old fashioned with comparison to similar towers Sydney for example The concept is well understood after 5 minutes nothing else to be done next consider skipping this site
1861,4,Worth the visit We went at sunset and enjoy 360 view on seoul The city is big and nice especially by night We used the elevator then the car cable and it was great 30 mn waiting
1862,4,A good place to visit from a list of must do in Seoul There is the love locks a good view from the top
1863,5,Our trip to N Seoul Tower was so exciting At first we were worried that we might get lost going there but with available online maps we were able to arrived there so easy and fast just by train and bus Once in the N Tower process in going to the view deck is very organized that even too much people were there as it was I guess peak hour 6pm the piles and waiting took us more or less 3045mins The view of the whole Seoul was awesome during the night There are lots of instagramable picture perfect locations around N Seoul Tower specially those with their loved ones Surely would still love to be back to see and enjoy at daytime
1864,5,Great view who wants to see the beauty of Seoul Every corner on the tower is picture perfect Will be back here as soon as possible
1865,3,Visited the tower at night The line going up and coming down the cable car was so long Waited for like 1 hour or more Once at the observation deck not what I expected it to be The place is not that big and it became too crowded Could not enjoy the view because there were too many people Walking around the deck was troublesome too
1866,5,What a great experience  You dont realize how massive the city is until you see it from Seoul tower Stay into the evening to see the lights of the city There is a small beer and wine bar on your way up that was quite delightful
1867,4,We visited the tower in the later part of the evening and did not have much of a line at all for the cable car ride up to the tower The view was beautiful and clear and a little windy I would definitely recommend this to someone visiting Seoul for the first time They have a gift shop at the top for you to check out
1868,4,We went at 1015am just after the 10am opening time The tower was still fairly quiet no queues and we enjoyed the view Having said that the experience is quite cheesytouristy eg the animated video played in the elevator and you still get really good views from the park at the bottom of the tower Because of these points I dont feel like this is a mustdo and I wouldnt recommend it if you have to wait in line
1869,4,Took the cable car to and from the tower to enjoy the autumn scenery Watch the beauty of different colours of the trees on the hills
1870,4,Namsan or Seoul Tower is 1 of famous landmark in Seoul We went there day time and nite time Both are beautiful
1871,5,Was with my sisters and 2 nephews We took the Seoul City Bus which has N Seoul Tower as one of its stops We took nice photos before going up the Tower Very nice view from the Tower and cost is reasonable to go up the Tower Coming down we had some food enjoyed by kids and us Moms
1872,4,Suggest to go there early if you plan to go there and watch sunset As theres a long queue waiting in line to go to the top of the tower Estimate will take about an hour  waiting time
1873,4,IT is a long step climb to reach The TOP but worth The effort to glimpse The 360 view OF Seoul There are a lot OF Tourist and there was Cultural Show at The open Space The view is awesome ON all sides OF The City There are stores and restaurants for meals or snacks You have a choice to Go UP The Tower but you have to pay to ride The elevator A must see when IT The area
1874,4,Good to experience specially if you are a fan of the Love Locks area and to view the panoramic side of things of the city Things may tend to queue up during peak hours at the cable car so be sure be there before 5pm and hopefully there are not so many groups tours as it gets crowded
1875,5,I was lucky to choose a warm sunny day in October to visit the North Seoul Tower Having explored the surroundings under the tower first I then bought my 10000 Won ticket and rode the fast lift to the observation deck The young lady in the lift asked us all to look up to the ceiling of the lift as we started to ascend and the film then took us on a journey much higher than to the top of the Tower  we continued to climb up beyond the earths atmosphere and into space Very clever  At the top I enjoyed stupendous 360 views over the complete city and way beyond The sky was beautifully clear and you could see for miles and miles I liked the fact that at one level you could orientate yourself to your home citycountry and one level below you could spot the local sights  The gift shop at the top was well stocked I really appreciated the chance to buy a postcard or two with the postage stamps already inserted in the envelope I just needed to buy an extra stamp to cover the postage back to Europe And there is a postbox at the top of the Tower All well thought through Oh I forgot to say there is free strong WiFi connectivity up here  For me this is a must for any tourist itinerary of this fascinating city
1876,5,The tower gives a great view of the city most specially at night Its a great place to hang out and take photos It was so cold and rainy when we visited the place but it still had so much fun
1877,5,A cable car ride in the night time is worth taking and then reaching the tower is a pleasant feeling
1878,5,We were staying in Myeongdong area and we walk all the way to the cable car station is easy to find just follow the google map will do  We were there on 1910 and the view and the weather is just perfect Autumn season is the best time to visit Korea I guess We found a few photo spots and managed to take some photos because it wasnt crowded on that day The B duck status is so cute and the love locks bridge is just so eye catching We spent a few hours up there mainly enjoying the scenery
1879,5,If your in myeongdong then this place is a 15min walk Once you reach the site you need to take a cable car to reach the top of the mountain The wait for the cable car is 10mins It takes another 5mins to reach the top  Some stunning views from the top If you have a good camera you will be thrilled to take the best shots
1880,4,I took the loop bus no 5 1100 won from myeongdong exit 3 bus stop Took us 30 minutes to reach the tower Once alight there is still a very steep slope to reach the tower It is the same irregardless which transport you take cable car Nice observatory to see the whole of Seoul with its autumn colors slowly turning
1881,4,A very good view from the tower People buy locks write their names and hang therelovers You can take the cable car to enjoy the Scenery
1882,3,Nothing spectacular once you arrive at the top of the Seoul Tower beside enjoing the city landscape It is a tourist attraction so expect nothing more than souvenir shops gift shops kitchy activities and pricey restaurants
1883,4,Recommended to find a way to the cable car station we walk upslope to the station  Take a cable car to enjoy the scenery to N Seoul Tower  Plenty of food options  Good time to visit is an hour before sunset
1884,5,Great stunning views of Seoul However lines are super long It took us 30min to get tickets for the cable car Additional 20min to get tickets for elevator to go up Here is the killer 1 hour line to come back down I am sure it also depends on time of the day and weather etc regardless it was all worth it We loved the view There is also coffee shops up there to enjoy your latte
1885,5,Take the cable car  although we did have to squeeze alongside a ton of people but if youre going in autumn its worth it We loved taking pictures here and our 4yo and 7yo loved to run around and also got to go to Hello Kitty Island which isnt an island but rather a unit which takes you through Hello Kitty history and rooms My kids did enjoy this  We chose not to go up the tower  we did this the last time we went to Namsan so we didnt feel it was worth the money  You dont need to bring any locks along as they are also sold in kiosks for krw10000 on location I would suggest going early as it gets more and more crowded as the day passes
1886,5,I really had no idea how big this city is until I visited the tower The views are incredible The city tour bus is a good way of seeing this along with most other attractions in Seoul
1887,5,Hiked up from the main road Steady incline so a bit challenging yet great views Take an elevator up the tower for great view of city Check out the bathrooms for a unique glass floor to ceiling window No one around to look in Had typical tourist shop but I found some beautiful cards that are pieces of art Couples left locks all around the groundswished I had my husband with me Hike back down was just as interesting as I saw different views that were equally beautiful
1888,4,Almost every city in the world has a landmark and Seoul is no exception I came here last year and again this year to check it out and see the surrounding area and views again
1889,4,Excellent viewpoint to get a away from the hassle of the city A couple of refreshment points and restaurants up there
1890,5,Touristy yes but a must see when in Seoul Great to walk down from the top and dont miss the love locks 
1891,4,Should you wish to burn some calories refrain from riding a cable car going here On the other hand if you are with children and those in their senior years I suggest you take that round trip cable car Try to explore the tower many spots are good for picture taking They also have 3D and arcade sections
1892,4,I visited this tower at night I saw beautiful night view and it was incredible When I enter the tower ticket cost 50 However the top floor in the tower there was 3D art museum It was fantastic Light turned on and the colors show the weather I hope you to visit this tower
1893,4,A good tourist site Reasonably priced Take the cable car to the top and watch the free daily entertainment
1894,2,Visited on a Sunday night Queued almost 50 minutes to go on the cable car which held about 40 people so not as romantic as it sells Then queued up to go to the observatory tower View is worth it but there are better views elsewhere where the view is still as good Worth the time Hindsight probably not go on a weekday
1895,4,We came for a nite view And its beautiful After using 3mins claiming my online ticket  And 10mins queue We r up there Nite view are beautiful There s a few restaurant n cafe Expect a 1hour trip
1896,5,Worth visiting as part of the city tour Great views of the City all round and for photographers great landscape shots can be taken from various angles It does get a bit crowded but thats only because its a great location
1897,5,What a great place for tourists and dates The combination of these two make N Seoul Tower a must visit during your time in Seoul I would especially recommend going around sunset As a tourist I was able to experience Seoul culture because locals actually come here to spend time with each other and add to the collection of tens of thousands of locks that are clipped to fences and rails around the summit There are also restaurants and stores If you come with a loved one and are thinking ahead bring your own lock Otherwise you can buy one in vending machines or the store Highly recommend this experience
1898,5,The hike up to the tower was well worth it Even if you dont go up the tower there is a lot to do in the landing area There are plenty of restaurants and gift shops in the landing area I did not take the cable car up because the line was very long but I here its a unique experience
1899,3,Very short and not impressive cable car will bring you to a hill where you will see lots of love locks several viewpoints and park Viewpoints are really great overlooking Seoul To go to tower you have to buy 10000 wons ticket It includes elevator with a ceiling video ride restroom with a wall size windows and observation terrace with a glass which will prevent you from making great pictures There is a photo service which will take photo of you and add different backgrounds to it for an additional fee Bottom of the tower has LG OLED tunnel and Kakao Friends figures Tower hosts several restaurants including one on the top of it
1900,5,Breathtaking views of Seoul Take a camera for good pictures The inclined steps up to the tower were a pain but worth the 25 minute walk We paid about 20000 KRW  18 If your not in good shape for cement stairs take the sky trolly over My only warning is the exit of the tower is kind of scary for a claustrophobic person Takes too long to exit and the process needs improvement for emergency reasons
1901,5,I bring my daughter use wheelchair to see seoul from here Shes very love itbut no sign for wheelchair clearly so we very difficult to find way I ask a few times to other people to get way for wheelchair
1902,3,First I must say that during Chuseok is not the best time to visit Namsan Seoul tower The queus was out of this world so many people visited Namsan tower during the holiday we visited Namsan on the 2nd day of Chuseok Not only the queue to the cable car but when you reach at the top there were so many people making it hard to enjoy the sceneries On top of that getting a food is another struggle due to the queue Id rather visit it on another time taking pictures is not possible I might say due to huge crowd everywhere
1903,5,Nice to take the cablecar to reach the top of the mountain and enjoy the view We were delighted to see a martial art show at the base of the tower
1904,3,10000 won to go up the elevator to take photos like this; hard to trust the perfectly transparent walls in the toilet assuming someone is definitely watching me doing the business wondered whats it like at night
1905,4,We took a bus to reach the Tower We did not go to the top of the tower but there were a few levels from the ground up that gave us a wonderful view of Seoul and surroundings We had a bite to eat avail from various outlets Great atmosphere
1906,5,The trolley car was packed going up and that was a little disconcerting However once at the top the view was spectacular and well worth the trip
1907,5,We walked from our hotel Got to a very steep hill to climb up and some stairs to get to the cable car We waited for 30mins to get the cable car and then 90 mins to get into the tower to go up The view from the top was worth it An enjoyable evening
1908,3,Can not argue that the views from the top are nice  The tower itself is not all that great  Low end souvenirs at the top  You can mail s post card from the tower  Love locks are cute  Not bad but not a must see
1909,5,Seoul Tower is an iconic site to see in Korea A little known fact is the color the tower is lit actually indicates visibility conditions Blue is clear and best viewing green is next best equaling a little hazy and red means bad air quality and limited visibility so best to visit on a blue dayThe cable car is fun also if you like hiking its a fun time tooGood eateries at the base of the tower as well
1910,5,When staying in Myeongdong N Seoul Tower is a must to go see Get a cable cart ride to the top and check out the views  AnthonyD
1911,5,Thanks to our guide Mike for working overtime in sending us to visit N Seoul Tower and back to Insadong Street after our trip to Nami Island and Petite France
1912,5,hi i just want to share how beautiful sunset view and how to get there if you want to go up to the top of Nseoul tower the entrance fee KRW10000 and also have package with drink  popcorn KRW21000  i go to Namsan Seoul Tower N Seoul Tower by bus number 03 but you can also use number 02 or 05 detail bus stop attached  arrived at the bus stop of Namsan Seoul Tower i had to walk through uphills road about 300meter little bit exhausted  there have a elevator also i just known it when i want to back to the bus station  wonderful view of seoul city and sunset made my weary gone enjoy it and take some picture of lovelock end of sept weather with 16 degrees celcius up there
1913,4,We were hoping to visit for sunset and glad we planned in advance We rode the gondola up the hill rather than hiking since it was a super hothumid summer day There was about a 3045 minute wait for the gondola ride Once we got off the gondola we bought our tickets to the top of the tower and stood in line for only 10 minutes Once at the top we were able to walk around and take plenty of pictures Also bought a postcard with stamp for about 1USD to write and mail from the top of the tower After sunset the city lights came on which was another beautiful sight Then there was another 15 minute line to take the elevator back down to the ground The area was fun to look at with the trees lit up The gondola ride down was quite quick with almost no line This is not a cheap placeI think for 2 adults we spend 50USD between the tower and gondola tickets I would have planned more time at the base of the tower during the daylight had I known there was more to see because they close parts off after dark
1914,5,N Seoul Tower is the perfect place to orientate yourself in the city and enjoy spectacular city views at the same time Its a decent walk up the hill if you fancy a workout otherwise there are plenty of buses to take you to the base of the tower Buy your ticket but dont expect to get admission straight away  this is a popular place and youll be given a timed ticket You can select straight forward admission or other packages  we went for one with popcorn and beer Having to wait I while meant we could explore the lower levels for a bit and appreciate the architecture before we took the lift to the viewing floor  We got there as the sun was setting so could appreciate the city by day and night The views were impressive Try get there so you can see the sun set from the top You wont be dissapointed If you do leave the tower in the dark youll need to take the bus back in to town Finding the right bus was quite a challenge but after a fair wait we found the right one in the end
1915,4,Great spot to see the whole landscape of Seoul They also have their most known teddy bear museum to visit and little memorabilia to brought home Definitely a must visit if youre in Seoul
1916,4,This is a good place to get a good view of Seoul in all directions They have several places to eat and shop for the usual tourist
1917,5,There is always a tower sightseeing experience in a big city but this one was better than others I have experienced With the tower being on top of a hill there are loads of restaurants and bars at the top where you can still enjoy the great view  We loved the bar area at the top as we managed to be at the top for sunset which I would really recommend seeing  The love lock concept has been done before in other places but the massive amount of them here is actually pretty impressive
1918,5,This was a perfect way to end my long day after much sightseeing around the city The views from the obsevation deck were magnificent I would recommend giving it a visit and if you have the extra to spend go straight to the top
1919,4,I consider this a must do in Seoul although it does not have to cost you anything You can walk up to the tower from a few different spots Its mostly stairs and takes 3060 minutes Some really great views along the way up and at the base of the tower You do not have to pay to go up to the observation deck to get the great views You can shop eat and play games at the many stores in the base of the tower This is a great half day for anyone including those with small children You dont really need to bring anything Water is good but easily bought along the way
1920,4,Had three kids along so decided to save a few bucks and just to go up to the area around the tower It had plenty of excellent vantage points of Seoul in all directions and plenty of food and beverage options too Kids enjoyed finding where we were staying but once youve had a look theres not really anything else to do so we had to bribe them with churros
1921,5,I stayed in MyeongDong and took the number 05 bus from outside exit 3 of the subway The journey was cheap and took like 40 mins cos we hit mild traffic then when we got to the tower you have to walk up hill a little to get to the ticket hall You can appreciate the views and the outside stuff like the fence with the locks on it without a ticket; the ticket gets you inside the towers upper levels for higher views I went up early evening and watched the sun go down  totally worth it
1922,5,Absolutely beautiful panoramic views of Seoul from the north Seoul Tower We went just in time for sunset and saw stunning views
1923,4,Good views of Seoul Take the public bus there Its easy and cheap Shouldnt take longer than and hour or 2 to roam around and check out the views of the city Worth it to kill a couple hours
1924,5,N Seoul Tower is a landmark of Seoul because you can pretty much see it from everywhere And its just so beautiful I had the advantage of staying at a hotel with a terrace that was faced right at the tower and every night seeing it was like magic along with all the city lights The view from its top is also very beautiful too bad that we were there on Chuseok and the crowd and huge lines of waiting were exhausting But still I do recommend visiting it
1925,5,I like namsan tower but i think the cable car is not worth it You can go there just by walking and have a good view of nature You can enjoy many things in namsan tower Just dont enter to the hello kitty museum Its not good
1926,5,Took the 1200m ascent and it was a lot of calories burned So I think Bring water Theres a vending machine and convenience store and a burger place when u reach the top Great view of the city during daytime Even better view at night
1927,5,Waiting time for Namsan cable 45mins1hr but worth it once you reach the top to N Seoul Tower The view is awesome  there are performances like magic show  martial arts in the afternoon just before the lights of the whole Seoul turns onwonderful
1928,5,While weekends can be crowded we really enjoyed the visit It was quite windy at the view point so you can carry a jacket if you visit in autumn winters even if its sunny otherwise The view was amazing and I especially remember the video which plays in the lift while you go up or down
1929,3,If you are staying in Seoul you need to go here to get a great 360 degree view of Seoul But beware there are always a lot of people there
1930,5,Now my second time in Seoul which is one of my new favorite cities to visit and it came time to explore further and the Seoul Tower was one of the locations to venture to next I went with a girlfriend of mine and we enjoyed every second of it and even did the photo op opportunity with the digital background and it came out perfect One of the best things I loved about being in the tower was the section of windows that had different countries cities and displayed how far they were and what direction they were in a fabulous idea to have here I also would recommend getting a charicature done while here as there are some amazing artists present
1931,5,Its tough to go up to the entrance to the tower The easiest way is far away from a metro so it would be a good idea to take a taxi to the library There are other ways to walk up but they are steep and hard to climb If you dont think you can manage a walk up there is a cable car which can take you all the way up Fantastic views I went in daytime but heard that the views are fantastic in night time
1932,5,Dont be lazy to climb to the top of tower about 15 minutes  Amazing Seoul was zoomed out here  A huge of love keys that couples buy  stick them by their wishes in it  But if someone buy key from store here  price around 578 usd per one  Worth buying or not  
1933,4,Really close from Myung Dong shopping district withing walking distance but yet so far removed from the hustle and bustle of the city Beautiful panoramic view of both the old and new Seoul Fun place for both couples and families
1934,5,This is a nice visit to get a great view of the city of Seoul We took the elevator up and then the cable car There is actually a nice path that you can walk all the way up to and down from the tower If we had more time we would do that
1935,5,i came here on April it cherry blossom seasons Nice place to sightseeing you can enjoy their nice view  a place you must visit when you came to seoul You can go upstair by walking or cable car for cable car you must pay 8000k won per roundtrip ticket
1936,5,Very good place and close to restaurants we have good time and fun with our friends highly remanded to all love Seoul
1937,4,I really recommended to come in cherry blossom season  1 point shorts for the way walk to cable car was far and slope Its not good for elderly
1938,3,We took the cable car up to the top The price for adult is 9500 KRW for a round trip  rather expensive taking under consideration that you will spend aprox 1 minute in the cabin and there will be not much to see from it Then we got to the top of Seoul Tower where you can admire AMAZING views and take some neat pictures However its next 10000 KRW for an adult During your trip to the top you will be obliged to pose for two photos fortunately you dont need to purchase them 15000 KRW each sick On your way down you will be also distilled through a gift shop  as the staff is hoping that you will be also tempted to buy some more overpriced things P  All in all  the beauty of Seoul is here expensive but worth it However I cannot say I enjoyed the aggresive money extortion during our visit
1939,5,Travelled up the first night in Seoul cable car was fun Views were amazing of Seoul lots to do while you are there We went yo the Hello Kitty world which was fun Nice coffee shop at the top with view out over the city A must to see when in Seoul Be warned the taxi fare there was very cheap but will be charged 3 times the amount if you want to get back We walked down the hill to catch a cab but thats not for everyone Great experience
1940,4,This tower is on the mountain Having laser show here and some restaurants around And its famous for couples to leave a lock with wish on the Net  Weather is cold sometimes so dont forget ur jacket
1941,3,Quite expensive if you want to include going up the actual The cable car only takes you to the base of the tower Very busy however we went up just as it was getting dark Amazing views of the city well worth the visit
1942,4,A classic choice for a tour of Seoul Its a bit of a journey going up there but a nice experence once youve made it Consider using the cable car
1943,5,Nice place to visit Take the cable and lock your lock and take photos Views are breathtaking Recommended
1944,5,A cable car to the bottom of the tower was a great way to go and see the city Views from the observation deck  amazing to see the size of Seoul The locks on the fences and trees and everything else were a sight to see in themselves Great parkland to enjoy and although busy has a peacefulness about it
1945,4,You have to ride the cable car or take the bus to reach the mountain When I saw all the love locks I was quite overwhelmed I felt the immense hope and optimism that caused each couple to place a love lock there There is a viewing deck overlooking the city Unfortunately it was raining hard when we went there so we werent able to appreciate the view
1946,4,Spent an hour here and enjoyed it a lot Nice landscaped parkland with a central plaza with shops and restaurants The views from the tower are stunning make sure you go on a clear day This place gets packed at the weekends so get there early
1947,4,Nice view of whole of Korea Not cheap to go up Need to pay for cable car ride and entrance fee But is the best view of Korea and not to be missed
1948,5,We went around 5pm so we could see the sunset from the top of the tower Ended up getting the 22000won ticket set with popcorn and a drink each and were pleasantly surprised by the size of the popcorn bucket The tower itself had excellent views and lots of good little souvenirs We sent a couple of postcards from the top which was a nice touch  hoping they make it home All in all reasonably priced for good views
1949,4,Ok Seouls tower and viewing deck is not unique at all but on a good day you can see for miles and miles and miles and still not get a grasp of the huge urban sprawl of Seoul today Worth the money on a clear day But the whole picturegift shop thing as everywhere else with these towers maybe a bit less pushy actually And the rest room  at least the mens is a hoot
1950,5,We visited the N Seoul Tower and were amazed by the views of Seoul A must see during the day with refreshments nearby
1951,5,Namsan tower was amazing it will give you a 360 degrees birds eye view of the entire city There are 2 ways to get to the tower first is by bus and second is by cable car We chose the Namsan cable car which can accommodate about 50 persons at a time There you can also find souvenir shops restaurants hello kitty  Sentoy museums The famous love locks recommended to wait for the sunset and hight time when the tower was lit definitely seouls icon
1952,5,Our personal tour guide bought us to the top of Namsan Seoul Tower You can have a 360 degree view of Seoul
1953,5,The views from the top of the tower are awesome I would not recommend going on a Saturday night as it was very crowded It seemed to be date night There are restaurants and souvenir stores Well worth it
1954,5,My husband and daughter went up initially via the cable car and then up the tower itself I didnt go due to vertigo They both loved it  can see for miles  Unfortunately both caught in a massive dump of rain on their way back but both still were upbeat due to the experience  Not for those not liking heights
1955,5,Must go to N Seoul Tower its an amazing view once you get up there lots of photos and videos you can take there is a long line to get up there and back down but it was worth the wait otherwise you can walk but takes up to an hour and has alot of stairs
1956,5,Well the N tower is a small commercial center It is no so cool BUT the best thing is the point of view at the top of the tower You can see all Seoul TAKE THE CABLE WAY to GROW UP
1957,2,Weve waited for more than 2 hours in a long at the end it was normal noting more than seeing Seoul from the top I dont recommend it
1958,5,The views of the city are quite beautiful My favorite part were the  love locks You can take a cable car to the base of the tower if you dont want to walk
1959,5,Visited here with my boyfriend last year We had amazing views of Seoul although a little cloudy  make sure you go on a clear day
1960,4,N tower gives you 360 degree amazing view from the height Whether afternoon or night the view is still awesome The binocular helps to see more
1961,5,A great place to view Seoul at night Lighting is very beautiful and the pricing of the tickets is pretty reasonable as well  A romantic place for couple too
1962,4,Good place to see the city of Seoul from a height The observation deck where tickets are sold are at reasonable height so no need to buy tickets to go on top unless you are very keen
1963,5,I have been in Seoul for 4 days now I fell in love with Namsan Tower I used to live here 20 years ago and my sister remembers every detail of the restaurant I dont think that it exists anymore  The views are phenomenal like everyone said but I must say that the air feels so fresh and clean as well  the forestlike experience with mist in the air felt so good in my lungs  If I lived here again I would probably hike here 23 times a week Since I dont I will probably come back next week at the end of the trip  I went to the top after several hours of the typhoon At first I was a bit miffed as the windows were fogged up with condensation I debated to get a refund until I asked one of the attendants if I will be able to see the views So I waited and the images were breathtaking  Namsan tower captures the beauty and magnitude population of the city  One thing I thought was kind of weird is the voyeuristic feeling you get when you use the restroom You get the best views and if feel like someone is peering into your window but you have complete freedom  Last thing I really loved doing is too go is to watch people below look like the size of ants move around  Here are some of my photos
1964,5,We visited Seoul Tower in a rainy morning and were lucky in that the place was pretty empty which we understand is quite rare That means no queuing up for anything at all  The visit began with walking through the worlds first OLED Tunnel which is pretty amazing and the kids loved it After purchasing tickets we took a locker to place our bags and then went up to the observation tower but first passing an area to take our photos which we paid for later Despite that rainy weather the views were still pretty stunning  Once downstairs there is the large area where lovers can attach their own personal padlocks with messages of love and this in itself was pretty amazing However on this rainy day hardly anyone was out here  Seoul Tower is very child friendly with a Toy Museum the LG 3D World a place for games and a 360Degree VR Tour In addition there are numerous restaurants and coffee shops and stores selling souvenirs  On a rainy day due to hardly anyone being at the tower our family had such an amazing time
1965,5,I have been here a couple of times in the past years and I am delighted to see that there are always new things to do or museums to visit in the N Seoul Tower It is a good place for families to spend 23 hours
1966,4,Its a good exercise when climbing up the slopes towards the tower Price of ticket is quite reasonable and great view of Seoul
1967,4,Its like any 360 tower but on the mountain Take cable car up and down They got a resto but quite pricey as expected Its not really romantic
1968,4,I enjoyed the views from the tower I especially liked the viewing deck with 360 degree views of Seoul We did not take the cable car as it was far too hot this time of the year
1969,4,We tried going to namsan tower by bus from our hotel and got lost because the hotel staff didnt say we had to cross the road from Myeongdong subway exit 4 We decided to get into a taxi when the driver kindly pointed out the bus we had to board was on opposite side of the road So we got out of taxi and got to the right bus stop The many love locks at the tower were a feast for the eyes and the night scene of the city was lovely The walk up and the slope to the tower was good exercise 
1970,4,This is a great place to enjoy the wonderful view of Seoul city in the open air and inside from the tower The view is even better if you go at sunset and stay for the night sky view If you go with a partner or bff make sure to take a love locket to write something and leave it chained as something special to remember
1971,2,Doing a tour of Seoul tower is to expensive and not worth it in my experience The view is fun but I would recomend Namsan tower instead Also the place is crowded with tourists
1972,5,it is good to see seoul from above worth visit it takes 1 hour tour u have to walk up the hill i like it
1973,5,Guys Your Seoul Trip is incomplete if you dont explore Seoul Tower Go in the Evening Catch Cable car in the daylight so that you can enjoy both day and night views from Tower  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PLACE TO VISIT IN SEOUL
1974,5,Stunning views IF its a clear day love how they have distances to every city from the various directions on the tower great Toy museum on the first floor too and the cable car ride to the tower is a must too
1975,5,Dont forget to try cable car to Namsan and back from Namsan using Bus Better visit on Night Nice view in the night
1976,5,We went for shopping though since this was my first time in Seoul we decided to do a little sight seeing We checked into the Pacific Hotel and walked to the Tram entrance a short hike directly behind our hotel The tickets were 9 each for the tram ride up and once at the base of the tower we purchased a ticket to the observation deck of the tower Another 9 each The tram ride offers a great view though I was disappointed that it wasnt air conditioned In case you havent heard summer and winter weather in Seoul is extreme The park at the base of the tower is very nice with lots of areas to sit and enjoy the view restaurants a bar and shopping areas The elevator ride to the top of the Tower is quick with a fun video to keep your mind off the quickness of the ride The observation deck has a restaurant a bar a candy shop and plenty of shopping It even offers a post office with lots of fun stationary for purchase The lines to get updown to the park and tower are long though it is very organized I would suggest adding another drink machine in the staging area to the tram There is one right before you get to the stairs It would have been nice to have a machine as you walk into this room
1977,5,I went to Namsan Tower twice both of them on the last week of June I visited it at night time and on the afternoon the next day afterwards just so that I will be able to witness the night view and day view The night view was kind of a shame to be honest because it was very foggy so we werent able to see much of Seouls skyline However the day view was really amazing Also Namsan Tower had a lot to offer I went to the observatory and had the 360 degree view of Seoul The love locks were great considering the number of locks that were in there It was such a shame that I was alone when I came to visit They also have the hanbok experience which I greatly enjoyed Its definitely one of the must visit when youre in Seoul
1978,5,Nothing really special but it is still entertaining You can take a lot of nice pictures there and see wonderful places
1979,5,Winter time must visit so beautiful from the top if summer time suggest only visit in the evening its too hot
1980,4,The view at the top is great The surrounding area is also a pleasant park for relaxing There is also a love locks area at the base of the tower
1981,4,While in Seoul an nice spot to spend your afternoon hours is the tower of Seoul Sleepy after lunch but not tired enough Seoul tower offers you the excitement that you need but still in a relaxed mood Its a place for families young couples and groups of tourists
1982,4,You can take a cable ride or bus to this place Try to skip ticketing line by purchase your ticket online The tower offers a digital observatory with a 360 panoramic view located on the third floor of the N Tower
1983,5,We went to the N Seoul Tower in the morning which was a cool ride with the cable cart followed by a small climb and lift ride rewarded with the best possible views of Seoul  It is on the tower where you realise what a massive city Seoul really is  Although I think the tickets to the top of the tower were worth it if youre on a budget you can just walk more like climb up to the base of the tower which still provides a very impressive sight of Seoul Just make sure you dont plan that for the afternoon on a summer day  Good alternative to the Lotte World Tower as well
1984,4,Once I got on the correct city bus we drove to the top of the hill where the tower was Make sure you buy a ticket beforehand The views from the top in the observatory are spectacular The city and Han River are very picturesque in the evening
1985,5,If you want to get to tower by cable car from the ticket booth expect a 60 wait to get into the cable car then once you get up to the tower you need to purchase another ticket to enter the tower another 15 minutes wait The wait was long but was well worth it Dont forget to visit the bridge with all the love locks on it On the way back we didnt use the cable car because the line was too long so we hiked down and the view was beautiful as well So if you plan to use cable car just one one way ticket if you want to avoid the line to get down
1986,4,I didnt actually go up the tower it was good enough to stay down and take photos from outside The hop on hop off bus stops here which is nice and convenient You can put a lock on the fence if thats what youre here for Theres TONS of cherry blossoms all over during the spring which is when I came You will be able to get a LOT of great photos without paying to go up to the top which is what Id recommend
1987,4,If you want to go to this place but on tight schedule use their cable car The cable car station is around 10 minutes walk from exit 3 of myeongdong station But if you have extra time just walk uphill while enjoying the scenery Sadly when I visited here in May it is misty so I cannot take a good pictures
1988,4,Caught the Cable Car from the bottom after getting in the sideways elevator from the street The views are amazing Try to stick to the Left on the way up and the Right on the way down for better views Up at the bottom of the tower there is a bit to see and do with restaurants and lookouts and exhibits Probably more to do when the weather is not so hot because there looked like nice walking trails around We were here to find the location of something from one of the Kdramas we watched and once we found the right spot we didnt bother to go right up the tower and we had been up Seoul Sky Lotte Tower anyway There were restaurants up here and we ate at one as they were reasonably priced which was a pleasant surprise My friends were visiting for a second time and it was fun to try to find their love lock again in amongst the massive amount of them there
1989,5,Classic experience with a thrill of riding the cable car The landscape is amazing Clean and comfortable Friendly staff Good view Thank you for great experience and history
1990,4,I recommend to visit the N Seoul Tower at night because the view at night is way more beautiful than the morning view There is an option of walking or taking the cable train up so I took the cable train up there is a bit of wait when we went up and went down after I would suggest to have a meal in myeongdong area before going up since the pricing at N Seoul Tower would be pricey and limited in selection  Tickets comes in a bundle when purchase at the ticket store that could range from 2 different visits with N Seoul Tower or N Seoul Tower ticket  a meal at one of the food area there  When you go up there could be a lot of ppl but dont let the crowd ruin your time because the nightview is simply amazing
1991,5,it looks very beautiful at night and if you visit you will not regret very nice view of the city and we enjoyed every bit of time we stayed at the tower
1992,3,Locations in the highlands of Seoul you can see the sights of Seoul from here especially when looking at the Tower You can enjoy the view of Seoul from a highest place Attention for time to visit consider about backlight
1993,4,The object of the morning was to hike through Namsan Park and make our way up to N Seoul Tower we had not need to visit the tower rather reach the summit and check out the views of Seoul  There are several ways to reach the tower hike cable car or vehicle from the main road in the vicinity of the cable car is a long staircase and pathway up to the tower 1200 metres long there are only a few drinking water fountains along the way and one toilet facilities before reaching the summit  Once we arrived at the tower there were visitors everywhere school children on excursions tour bus groups and independent visitors like us it is a very popular destination in Seoul There are other things to see other than the tower theres a large temple the Namsan Bongsudae Beacons five chimneys and the fabulous views There are locks everywhere designated surfaces for the locks all over fences while rather colourful and great to photograph I do not believe in this movement
1994,5,Only went initially as the boy wanted to go we took the cable car up which was around 7500 each for one way and 9000 return you cant buy a combination cable cartower ticket We opted for the beerpopcorntower combo which was only 6000 extra total 26000 for 2 which was amazing value as the beer was delicious and the popcorn was a good size and gave you several flavour choices We went at sunset and got great views over the city although its not as tall as most other towers We took the stairs back down and it took less than half an hour and you had another great view point half way down We ended up going back during the day as well and took the stairs up and down which wasnt a taxing climb at all and only took around 40 minutes We went back to do the love locks we bought one at the shop where the cable car startsbut you can also buy them at the tower itself The locks are very colourful and make for good photo ops as well It was good to get the views during the day as wellthough we didnt go up the tower a second time
1995,4,This is our second visit still nice to look around but a very hot weather even it is located on the hill  We buy rainbow ice cream that almost instantly melt Second floor with locks surrounding for taking pictures Nice view of city of Seoul from here
1996,5,it is one of mustvisit places to complete your tour in Seoul The 3060 views from observation deck is a great way to understand the city layout and location of those famous places in Seoul I can see the famous lotte tower from here
1997,4,We went just before sunset The views are amazing the views got better as it got darker it is worth the view
1998,5,As Namsan Seoul Tower is the symbol or the icon of South Korea this place is worth to visit It is very well known for its love locks hanging everywhere You dont need to buy tickets if you only want to hang your love lock there You can also go inside the plaza to see around take a picture and enjoy the food You only need to pay if you want to go to the top of the tower and to take the cable car Moreover there is also a performance and you can enjoy it for free For the lock it is suggested to bring your own because its quite pricey there Overall Namsan Seoul Tower is worth to visit place
1999,5,A ride up in the large cable car is the start of a wonderul journey Once you arrive at the viewing platform up the tower the 360 degree views are outstanding Make sure you visit the bathroomsits worth a look too If you part with a few thousand won you can buy a Love Lock and leave it attached to the railings with your loved ones details on itthere are millions of love locks there 
2000,5,Me and my parents went here to visit and this place is amazing So plenty of picture opportunity We paid around 23000 Won to get to up the Tower I personally wanted to get to the tippy top but we were told we needed to request a reservation lol Oh well maybe next time But the view we got was still amazing Please check out my photos Oh parking here is a nogo You have to go park near where the gondola is at or near the science building with the rounddome roof
2001,4,There is a very long steep climb up before you even get to the base to go up 4 flights of stairs and then the elevator to take u to the top Once at the top the view is beautiful There is a gift shop a few food places and the fences with the locks Alot of nice picture taking opportunities
2002,4,Who knew that N Seoul Tower or originally known as NamSan Tower is the Eiffel Tower of Korea That being said dont be surprised in seeing the hundreds of couples that venture out here If you take the elevator ride to the top not only will you get to see the great cityscapes and beautiful scenery of afar but see millions of locks that couples have locked on to lock up their hearts for each other Its pretty cool to see
2003,4,Namsan tower is renowned as an iconic national landmark and for its cityscape This place attracts many tourists and even locals especially during night time when the tower lights up There are many attractions aside from the tower itself; the most famous one is the locks of love where people especially couples go to
2004,5,A scenic place to visit Pleasant surroundings provide a relaxing atmosphere while enjoying the view
2005,4,A must go visiting Seoul Fantastic view despite the drizzle and chilly evening Be ready to walk a bit
2006,5,There is an option to take the cable car ride but we chose to hike from Myeongdong to Namsam park then to the tower and enjoyed the scenery on the way up We reached the tower at 5pm and stayed till after sunset approximately at 720pm The sunset was absolutely stunning Do plan your trip up strategically so that you can catch the sunset
2007,3,For me there are too many people It is somewhat interesting to get on top and to see Seoul from that hight But there is not much to do up there After Lotte Tower was built this Tower became even less attractive If you are really interested you can go one time But it is not in the top 20 things to do in Seoul To make it interesting do the trekking from Botanical Garden or Dongguk University up the hill to the Tower  Also crowded on weekends like everything else in Seoul
2008,5,This is a great experience The tower itself at night is mesmerizing couldnt get enough of it the panoramic night view is so breathtaking the best time to visit is in the evening before sunset i would recommend to get the single trip cable car ticket and walk down as there are more nice views along the way down Besides the cable car has very long queues going down we bought a return cable car tickets but ended up walking down due to the long queue Blessing in disguise we enjoyed the walk in cool breeze and nice scenery
2009,4,worth going in a clear day You can see even the ancient buildings in Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung Palace from just the lookout at the ground of the N Tower No need to go up the tower unless you want to enjoy a decent western meal there
2010,5,Been to London to Paris to Sydney to Berlin to Dublin to Dubai sightseeing towers but nothing compares to what you experience on top of Seoul one Maybe Jungfrau panoramic restaurant in Switzerland can be on a par with it
2011,4,We went here a saturday so I would say it was our own fault about the crowdiness ; The view over Seoul was astonishing and the amount of padlocks were mindblowing  Even though we had to wait quite a bit to go both up and down the cable car and up and down the tower I would say the trip was worth it  Be prepared with a big bucket of patience and a portable fan 
2012,3,This was a nice place to take my sister visit but I think that it is overrated The cable car was hot and crowded You have workers trying to pressure you to take a picture to purchase before you can actually enjoy the tower Dont expect anything spectacular
2013,4,We had planned to go up to this namsan tower park but not sure whether to take the cable car or bus Understand that there is also a travelator option too and of course walk up cycle up too So finally while walking along myeongdon area we just walked to the bus stop and took the number 3 shuttle bus 15 minute intervals 120won per adult that brought us all the way up to the top We just needed to walk another 300m from the bus terminus to the peak The weather was hazy that day so we decided its no point paying to go up to the tower observation deck The time was 530pm and the weather was cooling down but still bright  We walked about to take photos of the view of Seoul city There were lots of tourist but the place was quite spacious There was a section of the base where visitors bought locks and locked it into the fence  I think similar to one of the love bridges in Paris  There are some shops and several FB options up there at the base of the tower  We took a bus down again and it brought us back to myeongdon subway station The ride was comfortable in AC public bus Not crowded at all We enjoyed the outing and including the time we spent together on the bus rides Everything moment made the time memorable
2014,5,The buses are limited from a certain area so youre left to walk up a long steep hill Its doable as many people all ages were making the trek Once at the top the very was very nice There are stores and food options without having to go to the top The tickets to the top were about 8 per adult The elevator was quick and once to the top they have photo booths candy food souvenirs and great 360 views of Seoul It was definitely worth it Then on the way down you can explore each floor and the interesting details that each has
2015,4,N Seul Tower visit is better at night because you can appreciate the lighting Seul city and is more beauty the schedule visit is until 23 hrs You can ride the cable car or go up by stairs ways The people who works and the staff services very professional I really recommend this attraction is very fun and good experience
2016,1,Crazy long ques and crowds pushing and shoving definitely not worth it Very rushed by staff to get you in and out
2017,5,Great view and nice place this place is good for group of friends and lovers The place is full of love very romantic theme and a 360 view for seoul korea
2018,4,You could get a sense of the direction and whole view of the city and the main rivers in the city A very impressive view of the city
2019,4,Visited during the summer with the hope of catching the pretty night view but the afternoon went long and until 7PM the sky was still bright Went up to the 360 observatory deck and the view is very pretty indeed You can see the city of Seoul the Han River from many angles I suggest you order the ticket from online websites before your visit as you can get cheaper price eg Klook Below the tower is the love lock place you can enter for free and a spacious park where you can also view the city from a height There are many senior citizens visiting the place to exercise and stroll with friends
2020,3,I went on a Thursday night on a bus not many people using the bus which was good around 8 pm The evening was humid with some light rain When I got to the bus terminus by the tower the sky was still clear enough for some good night view of Seoul By the time I got up the observation deck of the tower it was very noisy and crowded with people with loud music playing in the background and bright light inside which cast strong reflections on the glass All these kind of ruined the night view and made the visit very unatmospheric Then mist set in and everything was shrouded I stayed for a short time and left I have visited quite a number of high towers in different cities and many offer great views day and night This is probably the worst experience I have had so far I guess it would be much better if I go during the day on a weekday when the weather is fine
2021,4,It may sound boring but its always a good idea to take a view from the top of the tower when you are in a new place Seoul Tower included Awesome view especially at night Also great at daytime It costs 10000 won per person to get on the tower You need to get on the cable car to get up to the NamSan Mountain or walk Taxi and private vehicle cannot go up to the mountain for protection of environment reason You can use either bus or cable car We used the cable car Round trip 8500 won one way 6000 won
2022,4,What I didnt like you have to pay separate for the cable car and tower Not to mention it was very crowded Thursday True we did go kinda late around 2100 At 2130 all the restaurants are closed and we really wanted to dine with the view
2023,5,Only spent a short while here as it gets so busy If you have a good camera then night time isnt so bad but if you dont then day time visit is better to capture the best pictures
2024,4,I went there twice one during week day day time and another on weekend night The week day day time was great not too crowded with good view  On the weekend night it was really crowded and the wait was 40 minutes going up and 40 minutes going down Not worthy We didnt pay additional to go up the observation tower level since the base level offers a good view already  Its worthy going up there but not on weekend
2025,3,Located near Myeongdong station so its easy to reach You need to walk around 1 hour to reach the top assuming you take picture along the way But its like mini hiking all the way elderly  children stroller  wheelchair will be difficult to go There is a cable car but you have to pay Beside its more fun to walk actually because there are things to see  restaurant  interesting photo opportunities
2026,4,I had a two hour visit to the NSeoul tower with a tour guide miss Sue Chung a government certified English tour guide N Seoul tower  the highest point of Seoul  from where you can enjoy panoramic views over the city You could find hello kitty museum onsite The view from the top was panoramic  SEE photos
2027,4,This is one of the attractions to accomplish during any Seoul visit  A bit crawled becuase of touristic mean  Wondeful place to take panoramic photos selfies of Seoul from different angles  Id recommend visit this place during late afternoon so you could enjoy sun set and why not enjoy something else  You need to pay to get to the top which I would recommend to do it but if youre looking to jump higher you have to visit Lotte Tower  555m
2028,2,Unless you are a world tower traveler not sure there is anything here for you It goes up and offers a nice view of the city That is true and overpriced THe revolving restaurant is WAY overpriced I only ate there bc we won a free meal and the 2 glasses of nasty wine was still 2000 The walk was good exercise up the little trail though
2029,4,The view from upthere is really amazing Not to be missed while in Seoul but it is a quick visit that needs to be inserted in a more comprehensive itinerarium
2030,5,During the day you get a great view of Seoul The night view is also amazing Any tourist must add this to your places to visit
2031,5,This is my favorite The love lock is so nice to visit Cool place and and when you look around you will see very nice korea
2032,2,This is a far away tower so you get to see the city but from far Im not a very big seeing big cities from above fan so for me the time to get there and the whole experience wasnt worth it Lots of shops some restaurants and its located in a park so that was particularly nice
2033,5,Sunset from the top is breathtaking After coming in one can stay in the observatorium for unlimited time  great for the beers  popcorn combo 
2034,4,Its good to see the tower and parkbut comparing to other towers i think its not very specialthere are souvenir shops city view cameras some love realted decorations and designs for taking photosetcthe ticket can be bought at the entrance
2035,5,The tower was beautiful Starting off its not hard to get too If you want to take the cable car then youll get off at Myeongdong station and walk about 15 minutes towards the Pacific Hotel to the right The only thing about the cable car is 1 There are very few cable cars so you wont get your own car but youll be on it with about 1520 other people 2 The wait time depending on the time of day you go can take up to 30 minutes to an hour THIS IS JUST ONE WAY btw 3 Be prepared to spend more time waiting in line for the cable car if you decide to do round trip  Another way you can go up is by bus which is very efficient Buses 24 and 5 will take you there and from there you can walk up the hill or ramp  Once you get up youll see the love locks which you can lock your lock in numerous spots around the tower Youll also enjoy the beautiful scenery  I enjoyed the night view for I loved how lighted the city was and how quiet it was to just enjoy the lights breeze and view I also heard that going during the day was just as nice  You dont need to go to the observatory deck to see the 360 view of the city for your able to see it below but if you want to do something extra then you can pay to do it and easily pick up your tickets Its also best to book your tickets in advance for the observatory deck  Overall I would recommend
2036,5,We do enjoy the night scene from the top but the strong wind is too cold so we keep stay in the building itself Due to the strong wind  the cable car is stop operating and we do need to go to Seoul Tower by bus It is quite convenient too The most amazing part is the toilet  is a big see through glass window you can enjoy the night scene while pooing or peeing
2037,4,Went there on a Friday with really good air quality so the sight was impeccable The price of 10k Won is fair The staff was absolutely bored however no interaction is needed to enjoy the view
2038,5,We opted for the paid entrance online But we found out you dont really need to go to the observatory deck to see the seoul skyline  Theres a portion below the tower which overlooks the city already I would say that was equally satisfying already I wouldnt have paid if I knew about it  Efficient eay to get there is via bus  Refer to the photo I took from the free view
2039,5,Enjoyed the cable ride up to the tower it was a cloudy and wet day so the views we enjoyed from up were not that great There is a hanbok rental and photoshoot place at the tower as also Hello Kitty Museum and another kids museum  both small but good to keep kids excited There are cafes too
2040,3,The view from all around the tower is great and could not ask for better however you do not need to actually go up the tower The surrounding views are great on their own and doesnt get that much better that it is worth the money Besides up top is just a massive tourist trap There are some shops and stuff at the base of the tower that are neat and a Starbucks for your caffeine fix So overall would make the trip to it again to see the surrounding area but not the top of the tower
2041,4,There are a lot of cliche things to do in big cities and visiting their tallest buildings is one of them But this was truly a nice experience From the lush setting to the fabulous views it is very much worth the trip Plus you can take a tram to get to it As Mirandas mum would say such fun Not only do you get amazing views of the city but you can send postcards all over the world They provide the postage Make sure you have enough memory free on your phone  you will be taking a lot of pictures Also right before the elevator to the top of the tower the staff take a picture of you that you can purchase later Very expensive and not worth it I saw signs that said no pictures but everyone was They sell popcorn like you are going to the movies like this is an EVENT Inside the elevator they play a short clip that you watch on the ceiling At first I didnt understand why but it makes sense How awkward would it be to be crammed in a silent elevator with 10 other people trying not to make eye contact Great for the whole family Tons of food options too Also if you are with your boo you can leave a lock on the railings like the French used to do on the Pont des Arts bridge in Paris Very cute
2042,5,The tower is very nice and surrounded by cafes shops and places to just sit and relax if you dont want to go up If you do go up you get a 360 degree view of all of Seoul and the surrounding cities It is mind boggling how many buildings there are here The bathrooms in the tower are also amazing as they look out on the view
2043,4,It was a fun hike up to Seoul Tower It had some breathtaking views of the nearby mountains It didnt hurt they had a deal for tickets when I went
2044,4,Sadly I picked a very misty day so there was not much of a viewEasy to get to with public transport Good staff to assist with directions Fast lift Nice gift shop
2045,5,View from the tower is spectacular Go on a day were the pollution is low and you can see forever there is plenty to do and eat around the tower spend a half day there and it is well spent
2046,4,Ideal to go here in the afternoon while theres enough light to see the colorful love locks and walk around the area Then wait the sunset at the top of the towerAnd see the lights change from daylight to city night lights Theres entrance fee so be sure to check Klook or other sites for discounts Like other tourist spots there are shops to buy souvenirs and coffee
2047,5,A very nice place to see Seoul at night Be sure you get there by sunset and stay a bit afterward You can reach the place with the cable car or walk up the hill Nice walk
2048,4,Went there before sunset and it was lovely The tower itself not high only 5th floor bit since it was up high on the hill so the view is 360 ard seoul  Lovely area ard the tower The tower itself is not big and gets crowded during peak time Got a lots of school kids doing field trip when we were up there so going down took us 45 mins queque time 
2049,4,Provides a good view of Seoul Should come late afternoon and leave at night so that you can see the day scene and the night scene
2050,5,This is a magical place esp for couple although i travelled with my daughter We enjoyed our stay here for free From chungmuro station there is bus no5 or 2 as recommended by locals  it was easy to see the yellow bus  just look at the bus map if there is no5 or 2 is passing by We didnt pick a tour since we have a tight budget The view here is so relaxing it was summer but a little bit cold during late afternoon We are looking forward for sunset but it was cloudy so we didnt really see it too bad huh Better bring your own love locks as it was 9 there but it was too pretty and has vibrant colors
2051,5,I have been up many towers but this is one of the best We used the cable car which took no time at all We went up in the evening and the atmosphere was amazing It wasnt expensive either compared to some others Ie Burj Khalifa Dubai It has food outlets shops and a very happy family feeling Would highly recommend
2052,4,What an overwhelming sight Below the famous Namsan Seoul Tower is a huge collection of locks hang on a long wall to symbolise endless love between not only lover but also within families Also other wishes such as friends to meet up in 10 years time With new locks adding daily it is very difficult to find a spot on the original fence Some hanging from another lock Not only padlocks  we saw slippers and socks hanging too Dont forget to sit on a heart chair  looks broken with a bend in the middle Great view of the city from the Terrace Padlocks selling at the premises are very pricey suggest to get in advance from outside
2053,4,We went there during the day The view is nice and ok but I flew to Seoul after Tokyo and was much less impressed by the Seoul view vs Tokyo Sky Tree night view Maybe at night it would be better The air around that area was very good and you can have nice walk around for an hour
2054,5,It is worth a trip up the tower if it is not too crowded and the queue is long The city scene up there is nice at night Actually taking pictures of the city from the park below without the glass window is much better and clearer But as a tourist heading up to the tower is just some novelty
2055,4,Its a nice place with interesting things to do The journey there is also just as interesting The view from the tower and from the bottom of the tower is good and nice
2056,3,The line to ride the cable car to get to the tower is so long it took us approximately 2 hours In the end we only took pictures of the love locks and didnt go to the tower itself because it was so late by the time we went up I dont recommend this if you dont have the patience for long lines The view of the city from the top is also not spectacular
2057,4,N Seoul Tower is quite OK but the view is amazing and it was a bit hazy todaythe view could have been better in my opinion My kid thinks there is nothing much but we agree that the love locks are interesting with some dating back to 2006 Overall a good experience Might come again
2058,5,Lucked out with no crowds or lines Cable car up to the base gardens; quite a few stairs lots of rock walls and stunning views make this outing one of the favourites of Seoul Scoring a reasonable clear day views were amazing the gardens spectacular and the walkways well worth the time Souvenirs food drinks and lots to do Sit and enjoy the cool air or wander around the lush forested area  very much a spectacular spot
2059,4,cant really say much about the tower i mean its a high place if you want to enjoy more get a package with ssentoy or hello kitty island depending on your preference no lines though
2060,4,This place is cool It has a led tv tunnel bridge of love where you can post locks and several snack stores I have not tried going up the observatory as an afraid of heights
2061,5,Stunning visit the price its OK to go up but the view is really worthy by night and sunset We love it Romantic spot
2062,4,Would recommend visiting the place for the sheer beauty of the Seoul skyline from above The cable car option for 85k both ways was pretty fine else the trek to the mountain can be exhausting Since the queue on the way back can be longer I would suggest to may be take the stairs on the way back and pay only for 1 way depends on individual choice The place is huge at the top with some good food options and the famous love lock bridge The view from the top is great and I would recommend visiting during sunset
2063,4,Its a breathtaking view from N seoul Tower The place is really awesome overlooking Seoul City Its really a great view from tower You will surely appreciate the view especially at night
2064,4,Go earlier or you will have to queue for at least one hours after 6pm Most ppl take cable car in the evening to be able to see the sunset Food is costly up there
2065,4,Landmark of Seoul My revisit after more than 10 years Views are the same but much improved facilities after all these years Restaurants and coffee shop on the observation deck floors Walkable from downturn area or can walk to cable car station and take cable car up 10000 won for adult ticket to go up to observation deck Restaurants and coffee places at the foot of the tower
2066,4,It s one of the main attraction of Seoul But my favorite part was the trails that I followed in order to go up and down  though the nasam parc nature  follow the old wall  smells of flowers and trees Really nice experience The view from the top is so nice
2067,4,Beautiful view of the whole city at night and have a few paid attractions in the base area as well Nice place to spend an evening with
2068,3,Good view from the top with small exercise going up to the cable car station we stay at hotel nearby myeongdong station the attraction is a a lot of locks with names on it and it is plenty of them as well as colourful
2069,4,If you are looking to see the city so you just got the place forThe view over the city is very nice but have a look at the weather channel before you got on line for the ticket
2070,4,Went up at Observatory deck of N Seoul Tower for curiosity Went up there not to see the view of Seoul city but to see the sky high bathroom and to dine in at one of the restaurants That was it
2071,5,Beautiful views and lots to see Hello Kitty was my favorite part It was a little expensive but overall an unforgettable experience
2072,5,Definitely a place to visit when you in Seoul the view from above is just great recommended to visit
2073,2,If youre under budget travel you can skip this Nothing to do here accept looking for the city Thats it I suggest traveller just go to namsan park up to N Seoul Tower and skip the observatory Its good enough
2074,4,We visited at night Nice to see the whole city with lights Its little bit expensive to go up but its worthy
2075,5,A bunch of friends went up one fine morning to the tower We took the cable car up and down but recommend walking down  if not both ways We also recommend going towards the end of the day to be able to see the view with both daylight and night lights popping up Sunset view is amazing Enjoy the walk and the view with a bunch of friends or your loved one Worth it
2076,4,U could choose to take the elevator or walk up to the cable car station We wanted to take the elevator but when it came to our turn the elevator broke down So we had to walk up It wasnt too bad though We rode the cable car up to the tower and reached in time for sunset
2077,4,If the sky is clear the view is nice; even better at night The tower is not very tall so it is similar to anyother city; it is however very simbolic from seoul there is like a small mall at the bottom of the tower and ssometimes cultural performances too
2078,4,I wasnt aware this was on the top of a freaking mountain Took awhile to climb up but when getting to the top youll notice the tower itself isnt very big The area up there is touristy with shops and restaurants Maybe get the cable car going up and walk down
2079,4,Lots of stairs and great hike up We took the bus down Evening is great we had good pictures of the tower and the city We didnt go up the elevator There is a free 3D picture show the reruns about every 10 min It was nice
2080,4,This tower is worth checking out when you are in Seoul However the Korea buffet restaurant at the top level is overpriced and lack of varieties not recommended There are other restaurants in the vicinity which I think worth exploring
2081,4,Best for couples to come here and hang love locks on We didnt get up to the top but surely it must be nice view from the top It brings more feelings when come at night time
2082,3,We took a bus from up to N Seoul thinking we have reached Much to our horror there was still a steep slope of 15min in order to get to the tower It did not help that the weather was so cold and getting up there made us out of breath The elevator up to the observatory was cool and the view of the whole city was breathtaking Unfortunately we went at night and all the window panes were full of fingerprints The place was dimly lit with several bright spots from the souvenir store that made photo taking really difficult  Was told by a friend whom went in april recently to go in the day as it is the spring period and there are sakura everywhere to seen
2083,3,Nice view of the city nice park around few pricy restaurant must be seen if you go on Seoul but do not aspect something incredible
2084,5,Great location to view the Seoul city You will be amaze of the love locks there  You can also rent hanbok
2085,4,Instead of getting a bus up like what other people seemed to be doing we ended up climbing up the road through the park to get here We were a bit rushed since we still had one more stop after the tower We used the Discover Seoul pass for the entry ticket There is a number on the ticket and you can only line up if your ticket number is within the range on display While waiting you can get something to eat shop for some souvenirs or go look at a display like the Hello Kitty one by the ticketing area The top had really nice views of the city The glass had cities and their distance from the Tower which I thought was quite nice particularly since Auckland was there We somehow managed to get there for sunset which was quite nice The plaza downstairs had plenty of shops and restaurants Wouldve like to spend a bit more time to have a more thorough look at the area
2086,4,Great view up there I think its better at night We had our private tour guide and he wanted to do everything in the morning lol Try to visit this place when you are in Seoul
2087,5,Just got back from visiting Namsan Tower and Namsan Park Get the cable car up Or walk but its quite steep and youll get access to sweeping to the city skyline Afterwards or before hand like we did take a walk around Namsan park Its beautiful and full of colour
2088,4,Had to wait about 15 mins to take a short elevator up to the cable car center Another 15 mins queue to get return tickets 8500 won per adult Then it was almost an hours queue to get into the cable car to get to the tower  The crazy waiting aside it was a magnificent view of the surrounding town There is also decent FB and shops here too We didnt go up to the observatory or the musuems though  Another thing note worthy to visit is the lovers Bridge Apparently couples buy locks now they dont do metal locks anymore due to environment reasons write their names on it and lock it on the bridge and surrounding areas as a symbol of locking ur love away  To the wife this was a romantic gesture but to me it was a waste of resources and creation of trash To each his own then
2089,3,It was a short cable car ride to reach N Seoul Tower and you need to pay 26000 won with popcorn and 2 soft drinks for 2 to reach to the top of the tower to see the whole city of Seoul Remember to buy love lock to lock your love along the fence or others place that you can find A must go to the toilet and you be amazes to see the city when peeing Its actually take less than 30 mins for the whole sightseeing beside the Qing for the cable car  the lift to go up the tower
2090,5,I heard about the hike and the cable car but since this was one of the stops on our bus tour we did it then The bus goes almost to the top only a short walk to reach the tower from there View is amazing We were lucky with the weather; it was blue sky and very clear so took some great shots We didnt go up as we felt the view from down there was good enough Nice walk around nice food options and plenty of other things to do Must to
2091,3,The cable car is cool but you have to pay extra to go the rest of the way into the tower Lines are pretty long but the view is worth the effort  The best thing to do would be to take the cable car up then walk down along the old city wall Its nice at night  Buy a love lock and join in on the fun
2092,3,Easy access via bus and namsan cable Crowded with a good night view Two spots for love locks photo taking I prefer the one near the cable as its not so crowded
2093,5,A very popular place  A visit to the restaurants require planning as the reservations fill up very quickly on weekends  The entire environment  view from the beginning with the cable car to the seat setup in  The Place Dining  which maximizes the view is a must do for a great romantic evening out with that special person  The Italian cuisine is good  however there is a limited of alcoholic beverages 
2094,5,Very cool place to go when coming to Seoul Take the Tram for a few bucks or walk up the mountain Great views of the city on a clear day Locks everywhere  pretty neat
2095,3,nice view from above we used the cable car all the way and the place was full of tourists The view of the locks all over the fence was colorful and so beautiful
2096,4,Great view from the top of the tower However there were full of tourists thus I had a hard time taking photos and enjoy the view  MUST go to the toilet as it is a open window concept 
2097,4,We used the cable car back and forth from the tower We went before it was too dark and got to the see the city lightning up I think at night the view is more beautiful
2098,3,We went up there just before the sunset its really a nice view during sunset The blossom is really beautiful up there The overlook of Seoul is really beautiful and romantic during sunset  We took a circular bus up to N Seoul Tower Its more convenient if you are going with elderly as you can take the bus from a few metro station exit like Seoul Station and Myeongdong Station So you dont have to walk a lot and a much cheaper and convenient way to get to the tower
2099,4,You can go by bus or cable car and then walk a little bit but its not that far On the other hand if you decide to use the metro be prepared to climb some stairs It takes a little bit of effort to get there but Id still recommend it
2100,4,Really nice experience to climb up to the surrounding of the Seoul Tower and take the cable car up to the actual tower Lots of little activities for children with Pokemon characters and areas to take pictures and enjoy the beautiful views of the city I would really recommend the experience If you are traveling with your partner try and get the lock in the actual city as they are extremely overpriced up in the tower
2101,5,The first time I came here it was daytime and it was fine but when I came back at night I loved it Its a beautiful view and there are fun museums and food places too
2102,2,Below the tower is a mall with some restaurants Theres also a place here to hang padlocks for couples and there are couple benches where you can take pictures of you and your partner Maybe kids can enjoy running around but other than that theres not much  As for the view from the tower itself  its just the view There are no explanations for what you see maybe a brief history of some key places would be great and I think there were no audio guides either Thats why I give this place 2 stars  If you do decide to go up though make sure to try the bathroom where you can get a good view of the city from the comfort of the toilet bowl ;
2103,4,We rode the cable car going up Took the bus on our way down Makes more sense than taking the crowded cable car Long queues to ride the cable car Love locks are good for couples Namsan tower gives you a perfect view of the city Got free passes from Shinsegae Duty Free
2104,5,We enjoyed the opportunity to walk the last part of the trail to the tower and enjoy the cherry blossoms  The tower gives just what you would expect  great views in all directions It was the first real opportunity for us to realise the density and spread of this city
2105,5,Basically it is paradise made for couples Nothing special just bunches of lockes But the scenery is especially good at afternoon to night
2106,5,My friends and I really enjoyed hiking upto the tower Only took us about 15h Nice trails and then great views when reaching the tower
2107,2,Visited this socalled Seoul tower but it was not impressive as it was just too low to offer a good view of Seoul skyline The lift just took 5 minutes to reach the viewing deck I hardly could take decent shots of the skyline as the glass were blurred by the reflections caused by the bright lighting from the candy and souvenir shops on the deck level To make matter worse the attendants could not speak English when i asked for direction to get down from the tower So dont expect too much from this dwarf tower
2108,4,Went up the deck for viewing at night and I did not enjoy it that much I was suppose to go there in the morning but the one on the counter told me that the view is not good because of the fog I did appreciate it I spent a few hours during the day below the deck and it was nice Got really great photos and stuff At night the picture of the tower is cool too because of the light unfortunately it was tooooo cold so I did not enjoy it that much
2109,5,One of the romantic place in Seoul where many couples like to lock up the keys together We saw the view of Seoul Its pretty much and good luck that snow fallsIt make us feels very romantic although it was very cold too Good memories to visit here
2110,2,I cant tell that the view is bad I mean of course we can see Seoul from a very high point but the night I visited the tower it was foggy bad luck  The thing that I didnt like was mostly about the organisation of the visit First of all you have to wait 10 minutes for a lift that can take 15 people max and then once you arrived up at the entrance youll have at least to wait for 1 hour or 2 jours You have to wait standing because there is a few sits Then once you are up in the tower you have once again to wait for 1 hour to come back downstairs  Consequently we literally waited 3 jours for a 10 minutes panoramic view I found this not worth it
2111,4,For 10000 per adult you get to visit the observatory deck of the tower Not a bad price compared to other cities Get there early for a quieter viewing experience We had no wait for the elevators which was great Great views from the top Amazing on a clear day
2112,5,You have to take the cablecar to go to Namsan Tower and then pay more to go up to the observatory Its all worth it though especially just before sunset so you can see the sun set over the city which is very pretty You can also purchase postcards up in the observation deck and post them straight away international too I even received mine though a month late The view was spectacular giving a 360 degree view of Seoul Its a must visit
2113,5,We walk up and took the cable car down from Namsan Tower  We visited the observatory deck and enjoyed the view
2114,5,Very cool view  Can hike to too if you have the stamina or take a round trip  one way cable car   But a love lock to make sure you leave it behind with a message for the city   Really cool
2115,5,Lots of nice views and popcorn  I like popcorn especially with cheese Maybe potatoes too  Shall we go eat swirl potato tomorrow
2116,5,If you want to get here by subway you can take line 4 blue line and stop at the Myeongdong or Hoehyeon station and take 2 minutes walk then you can take the cable car the price for 2 way ticket is \8500adult i recommend this then when you reach the N tower you will find a place full of love lockthey believe when you write your name and your spouse name on it and lock it in this place your reationship will be last forever the price for the lock and key is between \8500\14500 here you can also enjoy lunch or romantic dinner in the restaurant called the place or burger shop and many N tower merchandise are sold here
2117,4,Went up at night and the view was beautiful Walked on the transparent walkway which was an experience Nice way to see the city of Seoul
2118,5,I recommend going up for sunset if its sunny Now it takes a bit to get up there there is a little elevator that takes you up to tram there are stairs involved in most facets of getting up to the tower if you have a problem with stairs I would look up their website and see if they have accessibility things that I didnt see I did see one person in a wheel chair come off tram but not sure if they could go to top yes so anyways a good amount of stairs A little to a long wait for tram  elevator so give yourself extra time if you want to catch sunset or something They light the tower up at night so catching both day and night was awesome Highly recommend that timing
2119,4,Lock key merchandise of N tower love icon and bench you can get all the cheesy romantic ambiance here to to there theres 2 way by walk on wood stairs that took less than ahour with norma pace or by gantole i recommend just use the cable cargantole and later you can go down by walking go up when evening and sunset are near its best view to see seoul by aerial view in 1st phase of photos panaroma booth before go to the higher ground
2120,5,The glass floor was a fun way to see the city Even though it was a bit scary but a good way to view the city
2121,4,Need to walk up hill about 15 min from Myeongdong to take cable car A bit tiring If you are with kid Anyhow the view is nice and we had relaxing time spent there
2122,3,There is only one reason to go to the Nansam Seoul Tower  to get a grand view of Seoul It is worth going up just for that reason The 360degree restaurant view is also spectacular especially at night Just dont expect the food to be more than average and dont be shocked by the high prices  just remember you are there for the view If you are there for anything else you will be disappointed NOTE Dont go up when the air quality is bad  you wont see much
2123,4,You can reach the tower via foot or by cable car At the main times you will wait for the cable car longer than you need to walk up to the tower  The tower offers a wonderful view over Seoul So if you go to the tower spend some more money to go up inside of the tower Its worth it
2124,5,I dont have a boyfriend  but who say we cant came here if we dont have a boyfriend isnt it  we also can take a picture with all the love lock here  and i love this place so much 
2125,4,Its good place to go if you go seoul dont walk go go here the have something like cable car availabe paid 8500 per person to return way Romantic place with populer lock things and tower have good store too But too cold here if you come when winter season
2126,5,Whenever you go to Seoul you should visit the N Seoul Tower Such a wonderful place fresh air and beautiful view
2127,4,Good place to visit for relaxing and great city view Color of tower lighting changes based on air quality love locks are great
2128,3,The place is nice if u dont have any plan we went in evening its ok the tour to visit too small museum for toy and hello kitty museum and can keep love lock if u like food and drink there is few restaurants and bars
2129,3,When in Seoul one must visit the N Seoul Tower because when in Rome Im rating this a 35 because of the challenges my family faced when visiting this landmark  1 We were travelling with my mum who cant walk much According to multiple taxi drivers they were not permitted by law to take passengers up This meant that Mum had to slowly hike up the hill and mind you it wasnt the easiest of hills to walk up to  2 Again mum couldnt walk much There was no direct access to the top of the tower Once we reached the hill and boarded the slanted elevator there were still a series of stairs to climb to finally make it to the entrance of the tower It was rather handicapunfriendly  3 Youd think that after all that climb the view would be spectacular but it was pretty average The entrance free to the viewing deck cost KRW10000 per person and it was indoor Perhaps I am biased but I thought The Peak in HK was a lot better must it was outdoor and far more breathtaking  4 Getting back down was another challenge as you can imagine  I would still recommend this for those travelling to Seoul for the first time but probably best to go during the cold weather otherwise youd be sweating away you are wearing comfortable shoes and are not bounded by toddlerspramselderly
2130,5,I went there in december  It was supposed To be cold but because we walked a lot It was warmer   I think if we go non we can enjoy spring 
2131,4,Our Google maps made us go in circles to find this Use the public library stop then use bus 23 or 5 to get to the top Then youll get free access to the place some restaurants and a great view Theres a fee to enter the top most floor  They also have a Hello Kitty museum here
2132,4,It is best to go there at night because the view is very nice You can skip Observatory because the best view is in outside The place are also nice Theres so many restaurant or coffee to choose if you get hungry or have a coffee break We took a bus going to Tower to skip the line in Cable car and its not tiring
2133,3,In March you barely see anything due to thick fog But I cannot imagine this place will look any different in another season though  Located on a hill near Seoul you supposedly able to see the sparkling Seoul at night  They have a couple of stores and museum inside the tower area but it was just standard This place could be a better tourist destination if they involve more imagination in developing this area
2134,5,We spent an hour at the Tower because the view was very nice You can buy fridge magnets odds and ends Recommended
2135,5,A must see in Seoul  Excellent restaurant with nice view at the top  Go by foot to the entrance it is a nice excercise 
2136,5,It was abit hazy when we get there but we still managed to enjoy our time in the tower Initially we tried to walk but we gave up and ride the cable car instead It wasnt an easy journey I would say There are love locks garden where you can place a padlock all around the tower
2137,5,We loved our visit to this tower at night The expansive lights of Seoul are amazing The tower is fun and easy to visit Its definitely touristy but worth it for the view The cable car didnt seem to be running when we went and we got confused about which bus to take so we ended up walking up the tower It was about a 30 minute walk uphill but it was not hard at all
2138,4,From Myeongdong station take the bus 5 straight to the tower with only 1200W If you dont know how to get the bus there are mobile tourist info providers wearing red jackets at the main tourist attractions to help you out They are indeed very helpful Upon arriving at the tower you may need to climb a steep path about 150m to the main entrance I see many people just lingering around the open space where lovers placed their love locks along the fences Its very sweet and good for photo sessions They sell locks from a vendor machine but it costs 9000 W Wow Why dont we just enjoy the view of Seoul merely Hehe
2139,4,I sincerely recommend to climb to N Seoul tower or to take the cable car in a good clean weather A view is sooooo amazing You can actually see almost all Seoul You can also buy many souvenirs and get nice pics Really popular for love locks They are almost everywhere
2140,5,The tower is really in an amazing location the views were great and we were fortunate to go on a clear day There was also a show in the court yard of music which was neat We enjoyed the exercise and all of the love lockets
2141,4,This atraction is worth to see the wonderful views of seoul the tower has love locks all around the railings with lots of people leaving love messages
2142,5,Took a cable car in the evening quite nice apart from the chill  One of the must visit place when visiting Korea
2143,4,Fast elevators Great heights a bit expensive but worth the try scary though A must try when korea
2144,4,From the observatory of Namsan Tower you can enjoy a magnificent view of Seoul Around the tower is actually a park and before and after the visit of tower you can also spend a relaxing time Actually I walked to the tower from Seoul station It was a nice hiking
2145,5,It was a difficult journey going to N Seoul Tower from our guesthouse But nonetheless the trekking we did was worth it as we see Seoul by night and mesmerized on how people believe about forever by having love locks like the one in Parishoping and praying it soon
2146,5,Great place Enjoyed the hike to and from the tower Amazing view from the observation tower There is post office on the too that sells really nice post cards
2147,5,Super enjoy the overlooking view at the N Seoul Tower from riding to cable car to roaming the area We bought colorful padlock and put out name on it the lock in the designated area at N Seoul Tower Its good to visit during the sunset and night to see the lighting city of Seoul
2148,5,When you go there there are some shops you cant miss Moreover there is one beautiful Starbucks  Next to the tower you can find a beautiful place with some love lockers Well  some   A LOT  You should go there during the sunset
2149,3,It was a grey day and the view therefore was not the best Still worth a trip to see how huge Seoul spreads Nice view even from the toilet  would prefer to have a section without a window but free for pics
2150,3,I purchased the tickets from kkday website with a little bit of discount We get there by cable car which is fast and better than walking that long path to the tower Abit crowded inside the tower You may see the full view of Seoul but I guess it will look beautiful at night Restaurants are available inside
2151,5,We went there last Feb and it was a freezing cold night At the observation deck we were able to send postcards from the Namsan Tower
2152,4,Id highly recommend to walk all the way up to the antenna Its a good workout On half the way youll find some gym machines as well to make the workout perfect  Besides this the view over the city is really nice and this is a must for travellers in Seoul Only from here you will realize how big the city is  in all directions  For walking down I recommend to use a hidden path downwards on the other side Only use it when its dry since it will be muddyslippery There are no English signs so just follow the way downwards and keep the directions since the path splits several times
2153,3,Good place to have great views of the city Not very expensive but Nothing special in my opinion Went there at night so I saw the city with the lights on which was cool
2154,4,I walked up from city hall which was a bit of a haul there is a gondola up which was cheap and fast which would have been a better option overall it was quite hazy but still worth a look
2155,4,though not the tallest building in seoul Namsan tower is a must to visit for first visit to seoul You can put a lock love or just enjoy seoul scenery from a height
2156,5,We went to N Grill restaurant at the Seoul Tower for a setcourse meal with a rotating view It comes with free lift to the said tower After dining we went around the area and decided to buy some love locks It was pretty cool
2157,4,the lift does not bring us directly to the ticket officewe use stairs and it was quite slippery as it was raining on that nightwe went late so most of the shops are already closedone must really know where to board the buses 02 03 and 05 to go to the topWe saw snow the first timethe view was spectacular but as the he8ght restriction it was not that great compared to taipei 101 or tokyo towerCombo ticket consists of observatory hello kitty museum and SSentoy museum which i think quite worth
2158,5,My friends and I decided to walk from Myeondong Shopping District to the cable station of N Seoul Tower We did not look for the bus and just decided to walk The line for paying for the cable car ride and even the line for riding the cable car were really long I recommend tourists to be patient or to come early or may be to allocate longer time in visiting this place Despite of long waiting period we spent it was worth it The place is just so beautiful and romantic We ate in the restaurant in the area before indulging ourselves to picture taking sessions We decided not to buy a love lock but we enjoyed taking our photos in the site Since it is in the mountain expect for a colder temperature especially at night Bring extra jacket with you If you are a KDram fan then this place is a must for you since a number of drama series were shoot N Seoul Tower from My Love from the Star to the Legend of the Blue Sea
2159,5,Nice park around the tower wonderful views of the Seoul Has a restaurant on top did not have time to try
2160,5,Had a free morning so chose to get up early and walk through the lovely park and its trails A frosty morning didnt put me off as the steady ascent soon warms you up So peaceful for a big city As you near the top there are remnants of the old city wall well preserved and worth s look Fabulous panoramic views all over the city too Had hoped for coffee and cake but be aware that the cafes and shops do not open until 10am The walk was well worth the effort with routes to suit all abilities Also a public bus if you have mobility issues as well as s cable car service
2161,5,We enjoyed our time in n seoul tower Been there with friend Can see seoul from the tower A must visit Hello kotty is a good place for children they will loveit
2162,4,Try the hike to Seoul tower Short and sweet but memorable once you reach the tower  Excellent hike especially on a cold day
2163,4,We decided to walk up to the N Seoul Tower it was a lovely walk with little stops on the way which look over the city You can cable car up and or down if you do not want to walk The tower itself is impressive but the views slightly disappointing due to the smog
2164,4,There was a huge line to go up there on the holiday weekend and then no line at all on Tuesday night The views from the observation deck are amazing The colors of the tower at night very cool Not sure about the food up there we didnt go to the restaurant You can walk to the base but its a bit of a climb Better to take a taxi up there and then walk back down afterward and stroll through Meyongdong
2165,4,If you are planning to go here make sure to anticipate at least 3 hours by the time you get through the cue for the cable car and the lineup for the tower A lot of walking and stairs so would be difficult for the elderly and with a stroller they do have elevators but still quite a hike We went at night and it was very beautiful
2166,4,It was ok but not impressive Thanks the gondola The walk up is not easy and you just end up wasting time Good panoramic view of the city
2167,5,Great for the whole family Especially when you have little kids they will enjoy the activities in store there
2168,5,Thumbs up for this place Great for photo ops and sight seeing You can see the city view on the top and tha area is amazing Cable car is 8500 won for adult roundtrip tickets There are also restaurants on the tower but a bit pricey
2169,5,Stunning views of Seoul from the observation deck  its a must see in my opinion We took the bus from Myeongdong to the base of the tower but there is also a cable car There are a bunch of coffee shops and some food places around the base we didnt try these as the few food places we looked at were expensive Coffee totally reasonably priced Cost 10000 for each adult to head up the tower for some beautiful views of the city There is also a coffee shop and gift shop at the top I would recommend waiting for a clear day and going up in plenty of time for sunset There are awesome views from the base of the tower too but I would definitely tell you to head up there
2170,4,Very busyof course we knew it would be after the 40 minute wait for the cable car Huge complex and great views  disappointingly the viewing windows were pretty grubby and not at all condusive to achieving good photos I was quite surprised by this as Seoul was a very clean city and I would have expected there to be a team of people constantly cleaning them Other than the views the tower was very commercial with restaurants and shops A must do I think we spent a couple of hours here and did have difficulty finding our way back to the cable car departure point
2171,3,My friend and I didnt have a pleasant experience while waiting to buy tickets to get to the Seoul Tower Many times we were cut in line by some group of people or a grandma holding a toddler Then later on the whole family cuts in with the grandma and toddler Long story short it took an hour plus to get in line to buy the tickets and then wait another 40 minutes to get on the cable car to the Seoul Tower After we got up we waited another 30 minutes to be seated at the noodle house Everywhere was just waiting It was a madhouse The gift shop was packed like sardines This was during a weeknight around 6307pm It was just impossible to navigate around We were able to get a few shot of the tower but that was it We waited in line for the cable car to get back down And of course we were cut in line again Somehow I think our forehead said Please cut in front of us Overall nothing special but just a tower with a lot of tourists
2172,4,We were in town for only one night so one of the sights we wanted to see was the Seoul Tower and we were not disappointed Were from NYC and this definitely reminded us the Empire State Building in many ways It also featured a great burger joint excellent vantage points of the temple and the space needle is simply exquisite
2173,5,This is a great place to go It is wonderful seeing the city and surrounding areas from on high  I would highly recommend that you go on a clear day so that you can take full advantage of the view
2174,4,many photo spot love locks try cable car some snack bar available not so crowded day and night available for visit
2175,5,At first the walk up the hill was a bit tiring until you took the first ride up  Then you get in line to buy the tickets which Im guessing with no holiday will be less persons  dont worry it will be quick  then you go upstairs to stand in line again to get on the tramp which will take another couple 1520 mins depends on the time of visit  But on arrival to the top  itll be worth the wait  The view  the restaurants  the activities 
2176,2,Its not a place to visit with friends If you are not a couple it will be very boring The view is great but thats all The products prices are a joke VERY EXPENSIVE Disappointed
2177,4,I took the bus to the park at the top Was going to pay to go up the tower but said it was a 50 min wait and didnt want to wait You can walk around basically the whole base and get great views Go inside the base of the tower for fooddrinksgift shop I went during the Lunar New Year so that might be why it was so busy
2178,5,Great views obviously Got a slightly tacky but funny professional photo taken very nice Bought a souvenir up top from the sweetest girl ever awesome view of the city Must do
2179,4,If youre lucky enough to get a clear day this place is amazing You can see EVERYTHING If its hazy or the dust is extremely bad it might not be as impressive Either way the park is nice the entrance fee is very reasonable and the crowds are not too bad Just one thingparents be warned There is a candy shop on the observation deck Your children WILL want candy 
2180,4,The tower its far and difficult to reach by the public transport and expensive to enter  there are places that you can view the city for free or much cheaper than this tower
2181,4,Challenge yourself and go up through the winding stairs to appreciate the scene and the sights of course there is an option to take the tram going up or down The experience us also different when you do it late afternoon or evening as you get to see the lights Trivia  there is a wall situated along the footpath that has a historical meaning more than the locks near the tower   Tips wear comfortable shoes queus can be really long stay hydrated and bring some snacks
2182,5,We came from Myeongdong to N Seoul Tower by subway and took the bus no 2 to tower Weather was very cold good view
2183,4,If you like climb but not too difficult and want to have a wonderfil view on Seouol this is the venue to visit day time or night time both is good The best is to catch the sunset depending on season you might take some amazing shoot of Seoul
2184,5,Took the bus from the city to the tower and managed to catch the sunset It was beautiful esp for photo taking near the locks and keys deck Therere multiple bus number which can bring you back to the main city esp if you stay at Myeongdong Just look at the bored for the location that youre going and wait for 1015 mins for the bus The interval is very fast Very convenient to go there by public Mini shopping centre below the deck where to can eat or buy drinks like bubble tea but dont expect much from it as the main attraction is still the observation deck Theres also an arcade Place was very peaceful Still can oversee the whole of seoul from the shopping area as you can go out and take pictures at a higher level
2185,5,On the way theres always something to stop by for exemple the the locker where you can lock your love with someone special Once youre at the top youll get the view of the entire Seoul  most beautiful at night The Seoul Tower also provides you a lot of other activities such as game station and photobooth Personally I think the ticket is very expensive but itll worth the ecperience So very recommend
2186,5,We woke up super late on the day we visited the N Seoul Tower My friend and I were thinking of not going and just rest the entire day cause we were super tired from clubbing the night before however we thought that if we didnt go it wouldnt feel like we didnt visit Seoul at all And it was a good idea that we went We went there at night and the view was just beautiful Next time I go back I wanna visit it again during the day
2187,5,I went there around 6pm So I can saw the night view of Seoul I usually went there by walk but this time I took a bustakes 1015mins to the top of mountain The bus is stop at Chungmuro subwaymetro stationline 4 The bus number is 2 and 5 Go out Chungmuro station exit 2 and go straight about 20m
2188,5,The view is amazing at night and would definitely recommend coming at night when the city lights up Lots to do and wander around even if you dont want to check out the Observatory We didnt go up and still enjoyed the amazing view and checked out the different shops at the base of the tower
2189,4,This is just one option if youre looking for lookouts over Seoul Other buildings include the Lotte Sky Tower at Jamsil or the Seoul 63 Building Otherwise not bad and worth the visit
2190,5,you must take the ride up to Seoul Tower preferably at night so you can look at the lights of the city
2191,5,We went there around 4 oclock in the afternoon and walked up the hill  did not take the elevator The views were great from that location and so the pictures were good as well My son was enamored by the chain link fence complete with  love locks By the time we went up in the elevator to the tower the sun was setting which was perfect timing for pictures
2192,3,The tower is attractive but the best part is the views from its base which is already at a decent height reached by cable car From there you get great views across the city Views from the top of the tower itself are almost from too great a height  its hard to make out anything of note Oddly a cleaner kept wiping the windows Unfortunately this didnt make them cleaner but left great big smears which then meant everything you looked at was blurred Overall OK only
2193,5,Be sure to go to N Seoul tower in a sunny day Or a day that is clear Seoul can get really foggy sometimes and this is a view that you reallywill love to see I have been a cauple of times and i have walk all the way up take the cable car and in bus so you have different ways to get there Be sure to buy the lock if you go with ypur love one is a really cute and sweet tradition Is restaurants and the food is really good I am not a picky eater and i love to try new foods
2194,5,Amazing city view of Seoul Impressive elevator video show and loved the random game they have against the folks in Busans tour
2195,3,If you have 1 or 2 hour to spare this is worth a visit To get there a bit of walking from myeongdong but it is worth it
2196,5,Took the Cable Cars up to the N Tower and it was amazing We went at dusk and as the sun set we saw Seoul transform into a glittering city of lights and sparkle Well worth a night trip We visited the Love Locks had hot chocolate and took in all that the NTower had to offer
2197,3,Good view and the price is pretty good Id recommend walking up instead of the tour bus unless you are pressed for time the views are fantastic all the way and its a pleasant walk and relatively easy
2198,4,Came here twice But the tower itself is boring to me I love the love lock I love the mountain But too bad they only have two train to go up Or we can take bus instead
2199,5,Wow The N Seoul Tower is a must visit attraction You have 360 unrestrictive views of the entire city In addition each window tells you the distance to most major cities in the world This attraction took me about 2 hours to enjoy including lunch By the way if you have the chance get the Entrance  Lunch combo The cost was only less than 100 and it included three full meals and entrance to the tower
2200,3,Cant argue with the views from the top and the complex itself has plenty of places to eat and lots of souvenir shops etc However Im not sure its worth the money Maybe if you made more of a day of it and walked round the groundscomplex you would feel it was better value For the brave you can hike all the way up
2201,5,Easy to go all the way upspectacular views of the cityoption to go up and down by footsome restaurants and souvenir shops availablegreat place to take some nice pics
2202,5,We were lucky as it was snowing when we visited the N Seoul Tower We took the shuttle bus from Myeongdong and walked to to Tower Beautiful and breathtaking views
2203,4,It is the most popular place in Seoul Easy to get nice view from the observatory if u only wanna take some pics with love lockets i suggest you dont need to buy the observatory tix
2204,4,this is a good place for couple they can hang their lock as a symbol of their love but if youre single you can come here and enjoy the scenery a beautiful view of Seoul
2205,5,Namsan tower is the tallest tower in Seoul and it was very attractive to see the night Seoul when I was travelling
2206,5,I went there a least four times  with my friends  family and lover and all the occasions were good  In winter  in summer  day or night you can go whenever you want it will always be pretty  For me  I prefered the winter view at night it was magical 
2207,5,Everyone goes to the tower and you are glad you did it The view is amazing but try to pick a sunny day or less fog so you can see really far I liked the cable car ride up to the tower but you can always take the stairs At the base of the tower is where the Locks of Love are and thats fun to see You have to buy a ticket to go up to the top or you can eat in a restaurant We just went up and enjoyed the view
2208,5,From myeongdong shopping street you can take a walk to the lift near highway gate To reach the Namsan Seoul tower you should take the tram Up at the N Tower you can can city wall from joseon and see beautiful scenery from top of it
2209,4,The view from the tower was great It really puts the size of Seoul in perspective 10person for the elevator ride up A must for first timers to see how huge the city is
2210,4,The Seoul Tower situates at the town centre just 10 minutes walk from No 4 exit of Myeong Dong Metro Station of Route 4 Small and large cable cars are disabled friendly Although not very high you enjoy a nice panaramic view of Seoul on the obervation deck of the tower By the way the toilet is quite unique with a nice view of Seoul while using it Probably worth to pay a short visit during the stay in Seoul
2211,5,N Seoul tower is famous for tourist sighttry to go there by cable car and youll get amazing view of Seoul  IF the weather good
2212,5,It so amazing when I go to Seoul tower When I saw that place in tv I wish I will go there with friend I just couldnt imagine I can see the real pad lock
2213,5,If one desire the best view of Seoul this is the place you want to be The view is fantastic The walk up is a good exercise but totally worthy
2214,5,The tower was the last attraction I was keen to see and almost didnt get to as I dont think I couldve found it on my own My sister and I were able to access the tower via the cable car service something we TOTALLY recommend Its just a part of the experience Also unless you LOVE to hike we definitely suggest taking the cable car I had spent about 18 days walking around South Korea so decided against walking there  We arrived at the tower at 1030PM last admission for the cable car back is 1100PM otherwise you walk back down if you miss it so we spread our time between looking at the sights taking quick snaps then headed to see the love locks Honestly 1015 minutes up there is all you need The love locks were most interesting for us  The views from the tower were absolutely beautiful It doesnt take you long at all to do a circle before you are back to where you began Each panel has a different country listed so we were happy trying to find ours  The Love Locks didnt disappoint If you are a massive fan of kdramas this is the place to visit as seen in kdramas such as Boys over flowers and My love from the star etc When we came back down the tower there was a wall with thousands of signatures and messages left by people from around the world who had visited so we left ours too D Food places available there too Overall a fantastic experience and Im so glad I got to visit before I left
2215,4,if you take cable car 5K Won for 1 way and 85K Won for return trip for adults Serene and tranquil atmosphere up there and they have performance too
2216,4,You need to take a cable car to reach the top of the towerSome people hike but we found the cable car most convenient as we were travelling with an infant No baby changing place at the tower However when I requested a place to feed my baby the staff were very helpful and provided us their office room to feedThe tower does provide some good views Remember to visit the washroom at the top of the tower They have floor to ceiling windows with amazing views while you do your thing D
2217,5,There are 3 ways to go to this tower by walking using Namsan Circular bus or using cable car We chose the third one to go to the Tower and the second one to go back to Myeongdong We visited this place on Saturday morning From Myeongdong we just walked to the intersection near Namdaemun n Myeongdong We took Namsan Oreumi and arrived at Cable Car station We took one way tickets 6000 won for adults and 3500 for kids It was around 1030 am and there was no queue on Cable Car We visited N Seoul Plaza and found out that that Plaza had a lot of cute animals characters If you have children we suggest you to visit this Plaza
2218,5,We visited N Seoul Tower which is touted to be among the highest buildings in South Korea It is comparable to The Peak in Hong Kong It was fun And they also have other attractions in the building such as The Hello Kitty World and Ssentoy Toy Museum and Shop
2219,4,You can take the gondola lift to the top but if youre average fit I highly recommend to walk up there The road is sure a bit steep but not that bad that you lose breath The whole path is green made of wooden stairs and you can rest at any point There are a few view points where you can see breathtaking views and take pictures Up there theres a park by the tower and cafes and restrooms and souvenir shops I personally enjoyed the hot chocolate in the sun as the weather in November is a bit cool Again we walked down from another path where thousands of people were for a Sunday hikewalk Everyone peaceful There are monuments buildings and traditional villages on the way down
2220,2,From Myeongdong you can walk to the N Seoul cable car station It takes about 15 20 mins walk We didnt make it to the top as the queues at the cable car station was madly insane It probably going to takes us 2 hours just to ride on the cable car
2221,4,Coming up here in winter literally took our breath away due to strong winds and the cold However its still worth it to come up here to take some shots and enjoy the Seoul lights at night Purchasing the lock isnt necessary but still a good memory
2222,4,Everything here is a bit pricy however it is a great sightseeing or dating venue We roamed around the complex looking at the love locks super hero museum coffee shop and gift store We then ventured to the observatory where it had a nice view of the city photo booth and another gift shop We ended the night with a romantic dinner in the revolving restaurant It costs atleast 130K wons per person to eat here you are really paying for the experience
2223,4,It is also known as Namasan tower and located on one of the the highest land in Seoul and is visible from most of city It can only be reached by public bus or a hike up the steep landscape We enjoyed the view of the city and beyond once on top of the viewing platform There are a number of small caferestaurant located within the complex where we enjoyed some food and beer Definitely a place to visit in Seoul
2224,5,To Fall in love in seoul South Korea is to go to seoul tower at night time Tho almost every tourist spot in seoul is to be paid in thousands of won it was one of the best spot in Korea
2225,5,Its so pretty at night Mesmerising view from the viewing deck The love locks were a sight to behold as well
2226,4,Was at N Tower in 2013 In 2017 is so nice to be back it the also a different feel as it was winter it snow everywhere  this time with our little princeI also that the price at the NTower is cost more compare a few year back
2227,4,Just stopped and took pictures did not climb was on Hop on and Hop off bus Toocold to stand around in January
2228,3,Worth a visit for the views but not much else up there and all a bit of a mess Walking up is very steep so be aware
2229,5,You get a great feeling about Seoul nice to be there for sunset especially for romantic dates You can walk up from Grand Hyatt hotel through the park so that you earn your drink and food at the top You can book a dinner at the revolving restaurant  recommended to do in advance or simply go up the tower enjoy the view and have a drink downstairs with still a great view Please note sunset times might be a bit more busy Come when it is still light so you get the best of both Dont forget to use the toiletts or to check it out on the top of the tower  they are with a view Enjoy
2230,3,Firstly if u want to visit the tower u have to climb or have to use cable car But know that too much line to get in cable car Bur when u r near tower u may se amazing view of Seoul And couple may lock as In the bridge in Paris
2231,5,Really great views across the city  Good to go at dusk and stay after dark to see both day and night views
2232,5,Spending entire day here was really worthy Spectacular view from the observatory tower I got a cheap deal from Klookcom and got the chance to enter the Ssentoy Museum
2233,4,Nice but I really would stay with my visit to Lotte Tower Is nice to go but if you have to choose go to Lotte Tower
2234,4,You can take in the 360 view of Seoul from the Tower See Gangnam the new Lotte Tower and the Han River
2235,5,Easily accessible by mini elevator car up and then there is a main cable car ride up to the Tower You can buy locks at the stores itself and join e thousands who have locked theirs on the fences around the tower Good photo spot and there is a mini toy museum and restaurants to eat Queues were fast moving on Xmas Day
2236,5,I saw Namsan Tower on many kdrama and it is as beautiful and romantic as what I see on the drama Go before it turn dark and then wait for nightfall The city below would be tinkling
2237,5,Spectacular views over Seoul Good refreshment facilities at the tower Quite a difficult walk probably 70 is climbing steps but well worth the effort required
2238,4,With the hike up few drinks and a marvellous view before getting cable car down Awkward to get public transport there but possible once you fathom networks
2239,5,Finally on my 3rd visit to South Korea I managed to visit the Namsan Tower I went on a private tour and able to skip the cable car visit and went up by tour van instead Love it Too bad the city view was foggy when I visited but I still like the place
2240,5,Visited the Seoul Tower in the night Nice view of the city with lights on the buildings Took a picture with the tower in the background Also taste the ice cream there Overall a nice experience
2241,5,If you are looking for a great view of Seoul please visit the N Seoul Tower It is a nice ride up if you take the Cable Car or a nice walk if you have the condition From the top you get to see the entire city Also there are some love fences in which people can express their love with a lock Nice to visit dont miss it if you are in Seoul
2242,4,Walking through Namsan Park will lead you to N Seoul Tower Alternatively you can take a cable car from Namsan Cable Car Station N Seoul Tower is a must to visit during your visit to Seoul You can enjoy the view of Seoul vividly from the Tower which need to pay an entrance fee There are also restaurants and some cafe that you can enjoy a cup of coffee enjoying the view
2243,5,We took a bus to the tower There was a walk up a steep hill and at the top to the right is the center point of Seoul marker The tower elevator incorporated an inflight movie on the ceiling At the bottom of the tower you can buy a love padlock and lock it around the fence
2244,4,Its a great tower to visit Nice view if weather is good If you have bought tickets online then that does not include cable car tickets which is 6  per person one way  Many locks can be seen on the grills  A good experience for the tourists
2245,5,Something really cool about looking down on a radio tower It was a great view despite the tower being yellow Yellow means that the air quality is foggy usually because of smog and there not being a strong wind to move it away from the city The tower is at peak viewing when it is lit up blue
2246,5,At 237metres tall tower this is a great place for photographs even in their toilets However do be mentally prepared as the place is slightly crowded
2247,4,Note the cable car tickets are separate to the Tower entrance ticket  We arrived via the cable car and the station opens up to the viewing platform with commitment locks Locks were available to be purchased as well as flowers from vending machines There was a cafe here to wait for the cable car if the queue is long  Otherwise it was a short walk from the cable car station to the base of the tower Tickets to enter the tower are located outside of the tower For two people we got the combination ticket with soft drinks and a bucket of popcorn free There were several shops and cafesrestaurants at the base and in the tower  As we visited in the morning there was virtually no queue for the elevator up to the observation level Great views on a clear autumn day There are very limited seating on the observation deck so dont plan to stay too long  Dont forget to use the washroom
2248,4,We went there by Bus No3 from Seoul Station Exit 9 They have a beautiful view We can see the city of Seoul from above and buy a lot of cute souvenir
2249,4,Though its not completely straight forward to get to the Namsan Tower is the perfect spot to take in a great view of Seoul Grabbing the bus to the cable car is probably your best option after which you can ride it to the tower itself When youre at the tower you not only get a 360 degrees view of Seoul but theres also restaurants snacks and gift shops Dont forget to check out the lovelocks Keep in mind the cable cars dont run when its windy so best to go on a clear day and its generally best to go at night for the view of all the lights when its not raining
2250,4,The instructions online to get to the cable car station wasnt clear so we kind of got lost a few times while hunting for the station We saw a few others getting lost too  However cos it snowed the previous day the fortress wall looked beautiful with the snow on them  View of the nearby mountains from the top was beautiful There was some traditional martial arts performance at the peak too when we were there and my son enjoyed it a lot
2251,5,We took a short tram ride up to the N Seoul Tower You pay to do this and then pay again to go up into the tower Kind of a pricey tourist visit but worth it when you get up into the tower and get a 360 degree view of Seoul There are restaurants a candy store and lots of things for children to do We really enjoyed this site
2252,4,Took a cab up to the cable station you can climb and hike if you have strong legs and energy But personally it would be dreading as i see the steps were steep Cable car ride was nice I think we enjoyed the cable car most Up at Namsan the view was breathtaking Its a place to take lots of pictures and getting a lock was not necessary for me There are cafes place to sit and place to play claw machine
2253,5,Its really good for those who want to release some stress Its not only for couples You guys also can go alone The view is really awesome at night Becouse u guys can see colorful of the whole Seoul City
2254,5,You will get the best view of Seoul Ice cream food  others are available Large Led panel offers a great view Enjoy cultural programs also
2255,5,As many times I can travel to Seoul Ill always make it a point to travel to the tower because of the viewsDo this you wont regret it Theres food up there so you need not worry about eating before you go if youre in a rush
2256,5,Seoul has plenty of interesting places to visit and the N Seoul Tower is one of the places we liked most There are some places to lock a love padlock and leave a piece of your history there You can see an outstanding view of Seoul the Han River and of course N Seoul Tower
2257,5,Hi my family old and young went up to the cable car station via foot path along pacific hotel The route is very steep and long I do not recommend travel by foot just take a cab up and down hill  By cab from top to myeongdong station is only 3600won My family walked up so dont have pricing  The N Seoul Tower itself is wonderful a must visit when in Seoul
2258,4,We went to visit the place at 300pm via cable car ride but to our surprise it was a long waiting lines to catch the cable car Take note of the uphill walking lane to go to the cable car station Our advise is to take the elevator located at the side of the hill which not many people know about it Save you the walking uphill agony esp to those elderly people We only got to know about it on our way down You should also get the Discover Seoul Pass since you can get into the observatory for free Be prepared to wait for 1 hour plus to get into the cable car and another 12 hour to go up to the observatory The view is superb Worth all the queuing and waiting Unfortunately for us it was about to come to winter season so the sky gets dark earlier but night time is also breathtaking You get to see Seoul from farnice
2259,4,Price is Ok Good view of the city Pay a little extra for drinks and a popcorn That tub is huge Would be five stars if it were easier to access You either need to take tram or walk up
2260,4,We went at dusk It was cold but surreal The night scenes were great Weather was really windy and cold but was warm and toasty in the observatory tower
2261,4,If you are a first time visitor of Seoul like me I would really recommend going to N Seoul Tower We took the subway then walked up to the elevator to take us to the cable car station The cable car takes you up the mountain The view from the cable car is also niceif you are near the window It can get really crowded in the cable car Upon reaching the top you will walk up the stairs going to the tower I suggest you go there before the sun sets because it will give you many beautiful photo ops Pick your spot because you are not the only one taking pictures Do not forget to have photos by the love locks You can bring your own lock or you can buy there Romantic couples will have great time there If you get hungry there are several restaurants  cafes by the tower To get to the top of the Tower you have to purchase a ticket When you have a ticket you will line up for the lifts to take you to the viewing deck There you can get a wide view the city You can buy souvenirs take photos or have dinner there We went there at the onset of winter so it was quite cold Timing is important Do not leave when everyone is also leaving because it will eat up your time waiting for lifts and cable car Bring a lot of patience it will help Do not let the waiting in line ruin the experience for you A good camera will help preserve your experience there Overall it was great for me and my family We had fun memories and pictures
2262,4,We went here via cable car KRW 8000 per person roundtrip It was around 9pm on a Saturday so the line going inside the cable car bound for the N Seoul Tower wasnt long however the one bound for the exit of the tower was full of people  We had paid a ticket for the observatory thru Klook and it turned out to be cheaper as the one they were selling on the spot was KRW 10000 per person I got mine on Klook for 298 PHP per person  Buy a padlock and marker in advance if youre planning to leave a padlock in N Seoul Tower because the ones they have there are pretty overpriced  Overall it was a good experience We got to see Seoul from the observatory and it was quite romantic
2263,4,Nice way to break up a city tour walk to the top enjoy a churros they were surprisingly good buy a lock and attach it if thats your thing Lots of photos opportunities  can be a little crowded
2264,5,Went on a very hot and humid August night without a doubt the way to go is up the stairs Its a long and steep climb but oh so worth it Anyone can take the gondola up take the less traveled route
2265,3,Seriously no harm if you skip this if you travel to koreaWas told by the local to drop at myeongdong station and walk to the namsan cable car but the walking part is like climbing a steep slope and i was travelling with 2 young kidsSo my suggestion is to take bus no 2 or 5 from chungmuro to go to the cable carCable car ticket is too expensive for a less than 4 mins ride
2266,5,View is amazing Awesome to see everything from above  during the day and also at night Take the cable car up to the tower
2267,5,Namsan Seoul Tower was built in 1969 as Koreas first integrated transmission tower beaming television and radio broadcasts across the capital Since opening to the public in 1980 it has become a muchloved Seoul landmark The towers main attractions include multicolored digital art projected onto the tower at night a digital observatory a roof terrace the HanCook restaurant the nGrill restaurant and the Haneul Sky Restroom Namsan Seoul Towers mountain surroundings on Namsan Mountain have made it a popular place to unwind for locals and tourists alike  Seoul has a number of viewing platforms where visitors can enjoy the nighttime cityscape or gaze out onto the Hangang River but the towers Digital Observatory is unique offering an astonishing 360 degree panorama over the city and 32 LCD screens recounting the 600year history of Seoul That is why the observatory is so popular and such a source of pride  Situated on top of the N Plaza the Roof Terrace is a spacious wooden viewing deck whose exotic atmosphere makes it very popular with lovers A recent attraction for courting couples is Locks of Love thousands of padlocks attached to the fence by romantic Seoulites symbolizing their undying affection
2268,5,Beautiful Views from one of the tallest structures in Seoul While I was there we got a combo popcorn and beer from downstairs and watched snow flurries from the observation deck
2269,5,Seoul Tower gives a great opportunity to look over the whole of the city for just a small entrance fee I went at night time which was amazing as Seoul was all lit up The cable car was also very good although there is a waiting time to get on There is also lots of love locks if you want to participate in the thousands of locks attached to fences
2270,4,Interesting to see Seoul city from the top I would suggest taking the cable car though it is quite expensive for a short ride Only thing lacking there is no clear instruction as to where to wait for the free shuttle bus that would take you to the cable car station I had to walk and it was quite a walk going uphill Other than the tower itself theres also the area for couples to profess their love for each other on padlocks that they hang on the fences along the way Quite an interesting sight
2271,4,Prepare your very comfortable shoes But the place is very nice to take a photo in almost winter season This is the place of the famous seoul tower love lock But Id rather sit in one of coffee shop under the love lock bridge it has good fish and chips taste and 2 beer in one package only for 17 won
2272,5,This is the tallest place to see all of Seoul You can either walk your way up or use the cable car Once at the top youll be greeted with a marvelous view of the city You can buy a small padlock to write love notes to your beloved and secure it at any of the fences If you want to see more you can buy a ticket to enter the observatory which is about 15 floors higher The view up there is priceless
2273,3,The view from the tower observatory was nice but you get quite a good view from the viewing area below Not really worth the price but the tickets wasnt too expensive We took the bus up the hill cos I read the cable car its not worth it
2274,5,We really enjoyed this place with a very breathtaking views of city of Seoul as this tower is located on top of a mountain  Easy to reach this place We went to the tower by a shuttle bus which stops at most of the main stops around Seoul city Also can be reachable by cable car from which we can have a nice view from the cable car  The place was also not so crowded and we did not queue long to buy the ticket and to board the lift to go up to the observation deck  Overall a must visit for families with young children
2275,5,Had a great time looking out over the city A must if its your first time to Seoul Just make sure your taxi understands you want to get dropped off at the cable car on the south side of the mountain otherwise you have a pretty steep walk ahead of you
2276,5,Excellent tower which is very cheap compare to other cities good views at nighttime and the elevator area is very good for pictures
2277,2,Be ready to climb up the steep steep road Its not recommended for senior people Not good to also bring infants because if theyre on stroller difficult to move up Limited access to go up the tower its quick but line is long There is no view actually because you could see the same skyscape when youre in your hotel or in the airplane
2278,5,We went on the clear morning at 10 am so we did not have a line Make sure to buy a lock there if you are that type of things  we did No line and it was nice Not the best tower but gives you a good perspective on the city We also took a walk down from the tower  very nice and easy walk
2279,5,you can buy a lock with your lover and lock on the wall the lock can buy from the shop at N seoul tower
2280,5,We were lucky and got a fantastic clear winters day Very informative and professional staff as well The padlocks were cute as well
2281,5,The view from N Seoul tower was amazing Everywhere we looked it was filled with colour We took the cable car to the top and walked down
2282,4,The N Seoul Tower is the highest spot in Seoul enabling 360 view of the city It is located on a forested hill to which a nice cable car is leading At its base a love couples area resides where youll find thousands of locks locked on every fence and special tree to denote a couples love Its a nice attraction to visit if you have some spare time
2283,5,Namsan Tower is an iconic structure in Korea and its one of my places to visit in Seoul From Myeongdong I just walked all the way to the top although you can take the cable car for KRW8500 roundtrip I preferred to just walk to the top because there are a lot of beautiful things to see while walking especially it was autumn The view from the top is amazing and it gives you a great view of the city So beautiful to see the city lights if you choose to visit at night
2284,4,We had heard that it gets very busy at night so we made sure we got up to the first platform before the sun set We had time to look around before having dinner in one of the restuarants which was very reasonably priced The view from the top was average unfortunately there was a lot of light inside the building that prevented a clear view of the sky There was a good view from the toilets though
2285,3,Good place to see the entire city from above However KRW 15Kpax is expensive Its only a high tower not any more
2286,5,I liked the atmosphere of this tower on the hill I didnt get to go up at the top of the tower because of the long line I got there at night which was too late to queue up Had a quite reasonable price dinner at the base of the tower and some starbucks drinks Some people come here to exercise because of the steep hill The only thing I didnt like is the overcrowded bus on the way up and down
2287,5,Go to the toilet there One level down from the top viewing deck ; the view will be amazing Trust me
2288,5,Built in 1969 this is an excellent tower on top of a hill providing maximum views Highlights apart from the views are looking a everyones love lockets affixed just outside at the base You can buy food and drink cheaply at the base and at the top Entrance 10000 KRW Allow 1 to 2 hours
2289,5,Perfect place to visit You can see the entire Seoul City from the top of the Tower You can lock your love story also in the special place just beside the tower entrance Very fantastic place to visit the view is extraordinary the cafe area offers great view towards the city as well A very recommended place to visit Note I recommend you to bring some cash when you visiting the site because the ATM on the site charging very high tax
2290,4,Took the cable car to the tower Great place for photo taking Restaurants and shopping at the tower
2291,5,We walked up to the tower late on a Friday night We werent sure if the cable cars were running so we walked about 20 minutes along the road to the tower It wasnt bad of a walk at all  we enjoyed the quiet of the surrounding woods The tower complex has many stores restaurants and attractions The view from the top was stunning I highly recommend going at night but Id love to come back during the day as well
2292,5,A must if youre in Seoul From the tower you get a stunning view of the city and its surroundings Also a very nice souvenir shop at the top
2293,4,A hike to N Seoul Tower is a must Beautiful 360 degrees view of the city and then take the cable car going down
2294,5,The N Seoul tower is accessible by cable car It required a long walking distance with slope to Namsan Cable Car boarding place after coming out from Gate 2 Myeongdong subway station may take taxi to reach the boarding place  The fee will be charged to visit Observatory at the N Seoul Tower But the great view on the top of Namsan tower has definitely become a good spot for photolovers  As well the visitor is able to enjoy the performance Namsan Beacon Mound Martial Arts at 3pm
2295,5,Visited the N Seoul tower a few times whilst visiting Korea truly remarkable sites when you to get to the top from day through to night You can either take a nice walk up from through namsan or you can take the cable car which was quite cheap Oh and great restaurants at the top too
2296,5,Just like most observation towers this N Seoul Tower gives an amazing 360 degree view of the city go Seoul People leave padlocks all around the Tower with writing on them Its a great sight to see Along with the observation deck they have a Hello Kitty museum and a toy museum but they both cost extra
2297,5,If we had more time I wouldve preferred to hike up but we took the cable car You could also hike back down Beautiful area and so pretty at night when its lit up The love locks alone was worth it to venture up the Seoul tower
2298,4,N Seoul Tower itself was just okay Its a closed space so the view was not really spectacular  The place itself was a very good place to visit Theres a Hanbok Experience store in the area which we really loved They have premium Hanboks for rent and various settings for picture taking The prices here are way higher than those found near the palaces but the same goes for the quality
2299,4,Visited the tower a couple of times during various times of the year To me best is during winter as visibility seems to be better You good a reasonable go view of the city dont forget to take your padlock ; Also there are a number of good restaurants and bars on the way back down into the inner city Its a nice walk to the cable cars its a bit challenging walking all the way up but quite good fun
2300,5,The love locks place is kitschy Such a photographic area We rode the cable car at dusk so our view was the city slowly lighting up
2301,5,Walked up gondola down Worth the trek Incredible views that really highlight the overall expanse of the city of Seoul
2302,3,My daughter and I went on a chilly slightly overcast night There were hardly anyone around but there were lots to do and see Several places to have a drink and snacks few restaurantssmall hello kitty store as well as few gift shops and plenty of photo op places can have you wander around for awhile The view is amazing with sparkling colorful lights everywhere Its even more colorful now because the major department stores and few hotels had Christmas decorations on Definitely a must when in Seoul
2303,5,One of the touristy things that everyone should do Take the cable car up near Myeongdong station and you will get an amazing view of Seoul Recommend going at night for beautiful nighttime viewing
2304,5,At first I thought this would just be another tourist trap but it turned out to be well worth visiting I went during the autumn season though so this could be the reason why it was so beautiful All the trees had orange yellow and red leaves making the little uphill walk to the tower such a beautiful experience It felt serene to be surrounded by nature while in the city Seeing the whole Seoul at the top of the tower viewing deck was also great
2305,5,Went with my Brother and his wife and even though it was foggy that day the view was still really nice We walked up to the tower but there are also buses you can take
2306,5,We visited the tower on a nice clear day and used the cable car to get up at about midday It was rather busy and the tower itself is a little pricey from my view so instead we just stayed around the base and the views even there are spectacular and make for some great pictures You must 100 visit mainly on a clear day
2307,5,For those who were not able to visit on Oct heres the place for you for Nov Autumn leaves and trees are extravagant for autumn For those who missed the big exchange of guards you can also have it here Plus photo opportunity with the guards  Double check for the exhibit at the top if its worth the price Skip the deck if its already cloudy on the ground chances are youll never appreciate the horizon
2308,3,After seeing the towers in Shanghai and Kuala Lumpur the view is nice but underwelming The tower is additionally not that high and the viewing deck is not that big However I do recommend visiting the toilets as they also have the same nice view and a bucket of caramel popcorn as you wait to go upstairs
2309,4,our hotel was very close to the cable car station yet we tried walking its a long uphill walk and very tiring but its worth it because you get to see and enjoy the beautiful scenery along the way and upon reaching the tower you get to see the magnificent view of the city
2310,3,Nice views from the top but thats about it We did come in the morning though so the views at night may be better Tip If you plan on visiting during the day come early in the morning to avoid the long lines from the the cable car
2311,4,Namsan Seoul Tower or N Seoul Tower as it is commonly called was built in 1969 It was the first tower tourist place in Korea It was also Koreas first integrated transmission tower beaming television and radio broadcasts to Seoul The tower opened to the public in 1980  The tower has a digital observatory and a roof terrace The digital observatory gives you a 360 degree panoramic view of the city I noted a few restaurants  the HanCook the nGrill restaurant and the Haneul Restroom The roof terrace is a great viewing area It has many padlocks attached to the fence by couples to show their love for each other These are the Locks of Love  The top of the tower is about 480 metres above sea level taking into consideration that Namsan Mountain on which the tower is based is 243 metres above sea level and the tower itself is about 237 metres  You take a free ride on a funicular from street level to the cable car station At the cable car station you need to buy a ticket here for a cable car trip to the tower complex You can buy a single or return ticket to the tower A return ticket costs 8500 Won equivalent to about GBP 600  August 2017 When you get to the tower you then need to buy a ticket for admission to the top of the tower  10000 Won  equivalent to about GBP700 Aug 17 You can get a great view from the tower base and it is just as good as the view from the top of the tower  In the tower the windows have the names of cities of the world and their distance from Seoul The tower has some kiosks selling snacks
2312,5,This place is definitely a must see We walked from Yongsan to the tower and had an extremely fun time There are many sights sounds and tastes to experience along the way like Namsan park the love locks and many souvenir shops and restaurants The real beauty however is the spectacular view of beloved Seoul from the tower Take the trip see the sights feel the power of the tower
2313,5,You need to get to Namsan Park before purchasing a ticket about AUD10 to the tower you can either choose to hike up or get in a cable car Once arrived you need to purchase ticket to get up yo to the tower Expect big crowd if go after 11am as this is a popular tourist spot for groups
2314,3,Whenever you go to viewing spots it is short You see the sight youre done  We waited about 15 minutes for the elevator We probably spent less time than that up top We saw what we could see at night took photos then left There were sooo many kids  maybe a class
2315,5,A must see for tourists  I go every year when Im in the country and although the view is the same it still takes my breath away  The nighttime view is so breathtaking and makes great photo opportunities
2316,5,I would recommend visiting this place at night not to late so shops are open when you go but late enough that you can see the lights I would say I mostly saw couples at this place but even if your just with your friends family or traveling by yourself its still a must do Bring your own lock or buy one there and set your mark You can either take the cable car or the bus transportation is pretty convenient and on a set schedule
2317,5,We spent a lovely evening at the seoul tower area firstly the cable car From here you can get great views over the city alone Bring a camera and tripod Secondly head to a shop and buy a padlock You will see where to put it We then went up the tower and took in the great views of seoul Afterwards we ate dinner at the buffet restaurant at the bottom of the tower Highly reccomended
2318,4,Nice to see from tower Seoul city This is my first time in Seoul so i really enjoyed to see Seoul city from Tower I recommend to visit this place
2319,4,Did a walk up to the tower in the morning Well lit up pathways The steps are well constructed Please carry water or fluid Great city views
2320,4,The elevator ride is already worth it It is just so cool to be in the heart of Seoul and to see the whole if the city surrounded by mountains Make sure you have little sit at the toilet too I know it sounds weird but just believe me on this one haha
2321,4,This impressive Tower literally does tower above the Seoul skyline The easiest way to reach it is by taxi or take a tour but the effort is well worth it It is situated on the top of a hill with a fast winding road to arrive The views are magnificent; across towards North Korea to the North and across the whole city spread out to the South Very impressive
2322,4,The place is a perfect one to unwind and correlate with nature This place with a view of the city lights in the evening and the wonderful trees and nature sight during daytime particularly during autumn which adds wonderful experience on your visit in this place The love padlocks scattered around the place are good way of taking a look about lovers wishes and messages to each other The N Tower is included to the tourist attractions when you get the Discover Seoul Pass
2323,3,The tower has to be visited during night hours to admire the beauty of the lighting The lift has an OLED screen on the roof which displays the city and its buildings along with various land scape  By the time the film is over you reach on top The view from the top is awesome Binoculars are installed on top to see the city from various angle You may have to drop 500 Won coin for activating it
2324,5,N Seoul Tower; YTN Seoul Tower or Namsan Tower is some of the names being called in this prestigious scenery and one of the most tourist spot in Seoul South Korea The tower is renowned as a national landmark and for its cityscape and it sits on the Namsan Mountain and attracts thousands of tourists Its a great venue for family with children friends couples and people who love nature to hangout  The Roof Terrace is a spacious wooden viewing deck whose exotic atmosphere makes it very popular with lovers A recent attraction for courting couples is Locks of Love thousands of padlocks attached to the fence symbolizing their undying affectionWhich is located in the second floor of N plaza  Opens 10AM to 12AM Round trip ticket for cable car valid for 1 day 8500 won Located at 04340 105 Namsangongwongil Yongsangu Seoul Korea Yongsandong 2ga YTN Seoul Tower
2325,5,This area is simply beautiful  especially at night Plan to dress according to the season that you visit It was a bit chilly when I was there at the end of October Beautiful city views Very romantic especially at night Be prepared to wait to go up to the top of the Tower; however the view is worth it
2326,4,We did not go for the observatory deck as the sights are already worth it Take 2 wat cable as hike is too much activity even for a semi fit person in my opinion
2327,3,We didnt bother going up the tower beyond the free locations as we find the base of the tower already offered great views of the city at almost 360 degrees angle  In particular we found the gift shop was pricey and lack variety of souvenirs We took the bus up to the tower and found it very convenient and cheap to commute to Would recommend visiting
2328,4,We were here in the morning so its quiet great but I think its best at night to see the lights of Seoul City at night
2329,5,We took cable car to N Seoul Tower Love their beautiful scenery They have locks trees which you can buy those cute locks from their souvenir shops and write both partners name  lock it there
2330,4,This is the iconic centerpiece of Seoul How can you not visit The park around the tower is absolutely beautiful especially in fall Theres multiple ways to get to the tower you can take a tour bus you can take the cable car or you can hike I highly encourage you to take the time to take the cable car up and hike down or viceversa The view from the top is great but its not near as tall as Lotte Tower which I also highly recommend The only downside to tower is its accessibility I dont believe theres a parking lot to drive your own car its out of the way for a taxi and its not near a subway stop Thats why I recommend the cable car or hiking
2331,4,Who doent like cable car rides and observatories It is a good contrast of beacon hill during the Josepn period and the technology now not to mention the romantic lovelocks instagrammable scenic spots and the vibrant hues of autumn Tip use the restroom
2332,5,Seoul Tower at night was spectacular the entire city is lit up and you can see for miles The cable car up to the tower was also a fun way to get up there There are shops for souvenirs and food as well plus many different spots to view the city
2333,5,Come during the afternoon until dark  Enjoy the view and city lights at night  Also you can enjoy walking up and down But would suggest to take the cable car
2334,4,This is an iconic place you should if you can visit this place it is close to major attractions Theres a cableway to get there
2335,4,Have a nice view I came here at spring and the weather about 15 degree in the evening and may be cooler at night we must prepare light coat love this place romantic and istgramable
2336,4,The ride up the elevator was super fast with cool visuals There are a coiple of activities you can do when you arrive at the observatory Best come at night for awesome cityscape
2337,5,We took a trip here on our first day in Seoul it was busy but a great place to look around and for views of Seoul Again there was reduced entry for seniors
2338,5,Started our day with walk from our guest house to NamsanThis is my fourth time visiting and the excitement is still enticing The wonderful autumn just right around the corner make the visit more meaningful  They have upgraded the place especially the padlock areaThe halloween theme accomplished the fall season perfectly However the shrimp burger no longer been offered  at N Burger  If you like to have view of Seoul plus the scenerynature you should not miss N Seoul Tower 
2339,4,Best to take a bus going here rather than the cable car Bus is cheaper compared to the cable You only need to walk on an inclined road going up so be prepared Its very cold here during Autumn bring thick jackets and its quite windy here They have a place to put your LOVE LOCKS as well You can spend at least 12 hours here
2340,5,Suggested time to go up by around 4pm then go straight on the love lock area and witness the sunset After the sunset you can go to the park beside the tower and theres a show you can watch its ideal to go up the tower by around 7pm so you can see the beautiful lights of seoul Dont forget to buy pop corn and drinks on the ground level before riding the elevator to tower its much enjoyable you see the view while eating and chatting with friends once you are at the top of the tower dont worry theres a lot of space you can sit on  Enjoy
2341,5,If you go up there you will enjoy an 360 unbelievable view of Seoul and surroundings It is surely worth the trip to see how big this city really is with over 20 million inhabitants close to seaside on one side close to high mountains  with skiing possibilities  on the other side
2342,5,Walking through Namsen park up to the tower was our favorite part of Seoul Beautiful views and when you leave down the cable car it is not more than half a mile to Meongdong area
2343,5,The iconic landmark of Seoul Go there in the evening so that u can get both day  night view Do allocate extra 1hour for the cable car queue I suggest that you take the elevator to the cable car station Walking there is tiring especially if you travel with seniors and kids as its uphill road To get to the elevator  exit at Hoyeon station NOT myeondong
2344,5,We paid and took the cable car up and walked around for a bit when we arrived It was nice in the area without needing to go further up in the N Seoul Tower Having said that we paid 21000krw about 21 USD for the two of us to go up the tower with two drinks and a large popcorn Or you can go up the tower for 10000krw each When we went up it was just in time for the sunset and thats when you truly can see how large Seoul really is
2345,4,We walked up instead of taking the tram Fine in 24 degrees Celsius but we are quite fit and were happy for some cardio Lovely once you are up there Cute shops and an arcade too
2346,4,We go on the night time due to our flight arrived in the afternoon Plan to catch the sunset but spend too much time looking for our hostel but the view on the night time also stunning Try the cable car for fast access to the top and video recording along the trip up
2347,4,The symbol of Seoul is open from 10 am Couples leave each others names on the keys after they are written down The observatory fee is 10000 won Hello Kitty has an exhibition hall
2348,4,Visited N Seoul Tower during my visit to Korea The walk to the Tower is very steep and a bit tiring but Im sure young people will enjoy In the tower it was good view of the city The souvenir shop was good too
2349,5,You can either climb up around 200m from the station level or get a cable car The walk is part slope and part steps Good exercise but not at all tough The views as you walk up alongside the old city wall are great  but excellent from the viewing gallery up the tower Highly recommended
2350,5,Travelling to korea will not be complete without visiting this amazing tourist attraction  You need to exert extra effort to reach the top of the Tower We went here last April 2017 and its freaking cold  This is also the place where you can see the love locks in the area Such a romantic place to be with your partner and or ur family
2351,5,Built in the late 60s as a radio and television transmission tower is now a main attraction for tourist and locals alike What attracts many people to this landmark is its multi colored lighting thats projected onto the tower at dusk an observatory that offers a 360 degree panoramic view of the city the Rooftop Terrace and the Sky Restroom My wife and I especially liked the Rooftop Terrace that offers a romantic ambianceThe terrace is a wooden deck with a city view and thousand of padlocks Locks of Love thats attached to fences walls and trees that symbolize undying love Also remember when youre in the observatory make sure to visit the Sky Bathroom
2352,5,Very scenic views we can even see the sunset and the mountains There are also many cultural performances showcasing the skills of the swordsmen
2353,5,If you enjoy a long walk or run check this place out The views are spectacular The walkways get work up a good sweat
2354,4,The tower is advertised as a romantic place for couples When we reached there it was so crowded and the line to buy the tickets were equally long and took us another 45 mins to line up to get to the top of the tower But that could have been our fault as we did not check if we could have bought the tickets online prior to us going up  Once you are up there you can see the whole of Seoul provided its not a cloudy day At the bottom of the tower you can write little messages and lock it by a designated fence there 3  My advise is to buy your own little lock before heading to Namsam tower because buying it there is quite expensive  Overall it was a nice and wonderful experience a part from the crowd
2355,4,First on my list before coming to Seoul was the tower And I didnt regret it at all Seoul is huge so you better come 236m above ground to check the city from air Also I was lucky with the weather so I got a full beautiful picture of this huge city If the weather is nice I would suggest going up by foot and coming down by cable car
2356,4,We made two trips up to the tower  one during the day mid week and we were pleasantly surprised that we didnt have to queue very long for either the cable car or the lift to the top But when we returned with our daughter to do a night time trip on a Saturday it was another story and we had a long wait for the cable car of about hour and twenty and then there was going to be another hour for the lift to the top You get a good view from half way so we didnt bother queuing It was very busy and we didnt bother eating up there either a good trip though and worth making 
2357,5,Perhaps it was because I went during the chuseok holidays It was mad crowded Waited one hour to get up and another hour to get down If youre asked to wait head over to the N Burger Unfortunately when I went late at night the Burger was all sold out so I had chicken tenders instead Pretty decent  Entrance fee is 10000won for adult But you can also get it on KLOOK which is about 20 cheaper Enter QL2E9 when you check out to enjoy 4 off
2358,5,So this is a touristy spot but well worth the time to visit just for the amazing views of the city Saw this as part of a tour but would go to see it on its own
2359,4,Personally I went at night the weather was quite cold October at first but after walking up so many stairs I dont feel the cold anymore Prepare water as there are less water dispenser Also there are not much place for visitors to rest while walking up the stairs so brace yourself It was also crowded when we were there and we saw a very long line for those who are taking the cable car But it has many stunning view and quite a number of observation areas we can enjoy while we are on our way to the top The place with the love locks are beautiful but full of trash so clean up after yourself after eating there Wear comfortable shoes as you will climb alot of steep and uneven stairs
2360,4,Not too far from the city is the observation tower Steep walk to get to the area from the bus Elevator takes less than a minute to the top thou long lines going up and down
2361,4,We decided to walk up to the tower It was beautiful but wayyy too hot in the middle of June Tons of stairs with barely any place to rest When we got on top of the tower we were soaking in sweat The tower and view is breathtaking Keep in mind the heat and stairs if you opt to climb up the mountain Great gift shops here
2362,5,We went to the N Seoul Tower in October The line to enter and to buy your ticket is about 90 min very long line when you are in the line waiting along the way you will find some people selling stuff like food and drinks which I think is a very good idea when you get to the ticket centre the staff there speak EnglishAnd the way up is by elevator before you go on the elevator they show you a short clip but they keep replaying the clip so it becomes boring when you go up in the elevator when you come out of the elevatorthe view comes and there is a candy shop on your right but tits really expensive overall the view is nice but there isnt much to do other than take pictures I recommend you going to the N Seoul Tower if you have never been to it or Korea itself
2363,5,We decided to walk from Naman Gardens A load of steps but plenty of seats along the way It was a little busy while we were there so we divided not to go up to the top of the tower There is plenty of observation areas around the bottom that offers excellent views Lots of shops to eat Gift shops as well Good restrooms
2364,3,It was a good place providing a really good view of Seoul however we feel their observatory tower is a little underwhelming It feels a bit stuffy inside especially when theres too many people and for the price youll see almost the same view from their cafe below The grounds of the N Seoul Tower though is really worth the visit There was a ramen place that we loved some shops for souvenirs large grounds to wander around a place for love locks and scheduled shows that feature traditional and historical culture The cable car ride to and from N Seoul Tower is also a good way to see amazing views around the area But be warned lines get really long so be prepared to wait a while
2365,4,This tower is not very prominent in Seouls skyline because of its small size The actual experience was much better than expected because it makes up for this in views It seemed like I could even see N Korea from here Be prepared for lots and lots of steps if you decide to walk There are mealticket packages that make dining much more reasonable Be sure to see the free cultural performance outside if you can
2366,5,It was fun riding the Namsan Tour bus to see one of Seouls tourist attraction It was an amazing experience Dont miss to see the mesmerising view of Nseoul tower when youre in Seoul NseoulTower Ktravel
2367,5,Gondola ride to the top is the quickest way to visit the tower The view from the top gives a great panoramic from the top It was surprisingly to discover all the love locks at the top Korea is a city of lovers
2368,3,Not too bad of a view up there but we realize without paying for the observatory deck the deck below where all the locks are do have a nice view The wait to head up was crazy We were told to come back 2 hours later But thank god we bought a package with the sensory experience and could head up the observatory right after Heading up to this place was quite a chore We had to wait an hour or so for the bus to travel up and down Heard that the waiting time for cable car was worse The frequency of the buses were slow Would suggest them to have a shuttle bus specially dedicated for visitors even if it means charging rather than having to take a public bus and to impose on their locals who merely want to take a bus from one point to another Actually another good place to see the view of Seoul would be Seoul Sky Tower that is newly opened and more accessible
2369,4,The tower features the highest toilet in Seoul where you can take a photo while doing your business Remember to buy your own lock and permanent market for the lock bridge It will definitely be cheaper than buying from their shop that sells them at 8000 won and above Buy the popcorn package with the tickets to the Observatory Deck In the floors below the Observatory Deck theres plenty of restaurants and entertainment such as arcade and a 3D viewing Highly recommended to take the cable car up and down
2370,2,The 5 hours of waiting in lines was definitely not worth the wait Better to use your time seeing other sights
2371,4,Great opportunity to take in the scale size and layout of Seoul On a clear day it offers amazing views Lots of shops restaurants and souvenir stores at the site
2372,3,10 years ago it would have been a great place to visit Now its nice but not breathtaking Nowhere near the highest in korea anymore  Can get here by walking or cable car or bus All ok options  The queue to the top is ridiculous do dont bother
2373,4,We went there on 41017 We walked from our hotel to Cable Car and it took around 15minutes  We reached Nansam Tower around 240pm I had bought ticket onlineso no need to que to purchase ticket for Observation Just show our online ticket to Information counter  they issue entrance ticket for us  We just took the Observation  Hello Kitty Island package  We spend around 3  4 hours there
2374,5,Was a lot of lines and crowded But very nice views Is obviously a great place for couples and people getting engaged The hello kitty island and the ssentoy were a little over rated I wouldnt pay to go back in them
2375,3,We went to Namsan tower during a busy holiday and it showed It was a fun observation area to see fun views of the city However I didnt like that when we asked to walk down stairs they said no its unsafe and made me really uneasy about where I was Really high with no way to get down if something happened I imagine this is untrue but golly it sure was unnerving For the most part the tower was fun for views and I recommend going at sunset that seems to be a busy time but a prettier time too
2376,5,Had anniversary dinner in the restaurant in the tower Very nice food and view from the top is amazing Bring you padlock and just like tourist lock it on the fence
2377,5,The place is lovely at night with the lights of the tower on and getting a nice view of Seoul from the tower There are shops and restaurants at the Tower Plaza such as Starbucks and Gong Cha
2378,1,Do you want to waste your time waiting for a single lift up then a single lift back down  Do you like to queuewait for hours on end  Then N Seoul Tower is for you Ive included a photo of the line for the lift to the bottom floor what you dont see if that it wraps around the whole building twice  Dont bother coming up to the observatory youll just get back to the bottom annoyed and frustrated
2379,4,The best way to get there is to take a cable car up and wall down On the top of Nansam Mt There is a small park area and the Seoul Tower You can buy a separate ticket to the tower restaurants The 360 view is already perfect to different directions of the huge City Restaurants cafes shops
2380,3,We visited during the cold season so it was freezing up there Ive been here twice but we only did the locks once Tip Bring your own locks much cheaper 
2381,5,The tower is worth visiting both during daytime and at night The red leaves in OctNov make it a good photo spot while the night scenes are also great Youcan find the lock chains for lovers along the railings of the foot paths We enjoyed every minute of our visit there and had wonderful buffet dinner with great evening views It was difficult to get a taxi back to the city centre from the cable car station but you can always walk down to Myeongdong It took about 20 minute Quite a nice walk too after a heavy meal
2382,1,The view is kind of nice but is not worth it There is only one trolley to go up and the wait was one hour so we hiked up The home was not bad 30min approx Then when you arrive to the tower you buy a ticket 10k won and have to wait for your turn to go up Once you are up and enjoy the view for top 30 min then there is another massive like 4050min yo go down So lots of lines
2383,4,Came here for the view and to add a lock to the collection  To take the lift will cost around 800usd per person Locks cost around 10usd Throw in a drink or snack and your total cost will be around 30usd  If you want you can also walk up to the top and will take you around 30 minutes But it is very humid outside So you might be covered in sweat when you reach the top  Looks like I will be back in 10 years to retrieve my lock  Tips Bring water You might want to buy your own lock and print on it before coming to the tower
2384,4,We walked up the hill to Seoul tower which we would really recommend The walk was lovely and we stopped for the view all the way up   When we got to the top we thought we may as well visit the tower for an even higher view and we werent disappointed We managed to get a deal for two people two drinks and a massive popcorn for virtually the same price as two standard tickets which was a win We loved going up in the lift to the top  no queue when we were there and the video was great  We watched the sunset from the top so got the day  sunset  night view We have visited a lot of similar towers and viewing points from around the world and we did really enjoy this one Good value to money and a great walk if you start from the very bottom
2385,4,Ended up going for a morning jog up this hill to see the top While I only recommend this if you are fit the incline isnt forgiving it was well worth the effort The view from the top of this hill allows you to see most of Seoul There are a few places to eat and if youre lucky youll even get to enjoy some live entertainment near the temple at the top The tower is not too expensive and affords you a birds eye view of a massive city  There are a few other things to see at the top of this hill to include the lock bridge where young couples proclaim their love for one another with padlocks hanging from the railings And of course there is the gondola lift that will take you to the top and back for a very reasonable rate Id recommend doing this at night as it not only shows you the entire city but adds a bit of ahh to the ride since you are unable to see the tree line swooping past you  Overall this was a nice little tourist spot in Seoul and worth visiting There are many methods to get to the top and if you have the time it is worth exploring all the areas around the top as youll see some great sights
2386,3,Nothing special there when you already went to lotsa tower from different countries May be a great experience for 1st time traveller
2387,2,no special design You should go at night just to see the view of the entire Seoul Thats it Nothings special
2388,3,Tower is nice it is a small size copy of the CN tower in Toronto You can have a great view of the city but thats all Go if you have spare time otherwise you dont miss anything
2389,4,Its worth the view at the top of the tower to really get a feel for how big Seoul is  bring your nice camera to get some pretty amazing shots from the top Also If possible walk up to the tower and dont wait for the gondola  the line can be ridiculous We waited for over an hour to get on the gondola to get to the tower due to the humidity You buy the ticket up at the front before getting a good look at the line
2390,5,This was our 3rd trip to Seoul and we finally made it to the tower We rode the cable car to the top at night Nothing special there The views of Seoul from the tower were very cool and the city lights very beautiful We hiked down and that was very fun If you hike down make sure you have decent shoes and can walk well Not a place for high heels  Some thought this was the coolest thing we did in Seoul
2391,4,Stunning night view from the top but the queue was so long at 6pm I would recommend a later visit perhaps around 9pm if you want to go up the tower to enjoy Seouls night view to avoid long queues
2392,3,The walk from the closest station to the cable car is up various hills and some fun stairs unless you have a pram then it involves more hills We didnt have a map so relied on signs which along the way we only saw 1 sign for the cable car You can also walk up to the base of the tower but that wasnt happening with a baby and pram The cable car going up was packed as it departs every 10 minutes so best to be one of the first inline so you can pick a corner to stand to enjoy the view going up Once out of the cable car there some steep and uneven steps before you get to some viewing platforms with amazing views out across the city We didnt bother going up into the tower its self as there was some traditional performance going on so sat down to watch this instead Lots of tourists as to be expected but its a nice big open space to sit and relax
2393,4,The tower is quite touristy as expected but great views over the city and a great day out wandering in the park around the tower Many pathways very well maintained clean and beautiful nature
2394,3,Neat concept but could be better The lower levels have restaurants but is still being developed The viewing deck was filled with at least 100 small children on a trip cant control that We also went on a cloudy night  the ticket booth warned us before purchase which was nice The view was really obstructed by the bright lights within the viewing deck Also seating was limited which was odd At least 50 of viewing deck is retail space which made things very crowded The bathrooms were the best part If you have time and 10 bucks person its okay Take the 02 bus there and then start walking up the big hill
2395,4,This tower and location offer great views of this great city of Seoul A cable car ride up or a good walk make the tower available to all tourists The tour cost is reasonable and the views and information provided in the tower give you a good insight to this city The plaza also hosts historical dancers and other events Well worth the time as views on a clear day go on for miles
2396,5,Very Nice view from the Namsan Tower in Seoul you must visit resturant nar toilet souvenir shop rake the cabelcar to Tower Good ride to see the city
2397,3,Not much to do in Seoul so you can visit a big tower that is bathed in colorful light at night Nice view from the cable car and from the hill the tower is on
2398,1,The best time to visit the tower is before sunset so you enjoy the day and night view of Seoul I dont recommend visiting the tower
2399,5,Go for the view Enjoy the cultural dances and performances Very similar to US tourists spots with photos for sale and over priced concessions Plan to stay sundown it beautiful
2400,4,nice restaurants within N Seoul tower must visit nice weather but i think for summer it will be hot 
2401,4,We joined a group tour and N Seoul Tower was one of the destinations The observation deck gives a nice view of the city This place is also popular because of the love locks area
2402,3,Second time to be here Actually enjoy seeing conservatory tower from far More than 45mins queuing on ticket office Inside the cable car standing all the way in packed limited space luckily its short time
2403,5,Visited N Seoul tower twice during my stay at Seoul  once with my girlfriends and another time with my husband Fell in love with this place It has got a romantic fun feel to it There are two ways of reaching the tower By car uphill or by a cable car ride of less than 5 mins On a rainy day its more romantic as you can feel the mist around you At the entrance there is a ticket counter  then go straight up to the top using an elevator Just after getting out of the elevator all the guests are directed towards a gallery where they take pictures of all their guests  dnt forget to giv ur best pose and later if u want a copy  u can buy it from the top floor At the top floor one can view the city by using the special telescopes There are so many pretty souvenir shops  there are many options for coffee and snacks up there Outside the tower there is an open area specially famous for its colourful locks display Its a good photo point Namsan Seoul tower is a must must must visit
2404,4,Went for the third time Couple Love locks are still there We walked to reach the top rather than taking the cable car Nice area for an evening
2405,5,Second visit there Love the place Definitely go up by the cable car its great fun The view is awesome We were lucky to see a weapon handling demonstration which was awesome You can buy a lock and sign it with your loved one Food was good  tonkatsu was really good actually It can get really busy whatever the weather so be ready for it
2406,5,Dont wear any highheels here coz u goin to walk quite far and its climbing Lock your heart here as they got the padlock gate
2407,5,We visited during the week and the tower was overrun with school children on field trips The view was amazing and the area around the park was enjoyable Somehow we missed the tram ride up the hill but the bus from Insadong took us right to the top A little pricey but on a bright day well worth it
2408,5,Its a wonderful place with amazing city view I recommended it strongly to all tourists who visit Seoul Very nice elevator look like Burj Khalifa in Dubai The place contain many terraces with nice view We reached the tower with bus
2409,5,Pad lock lover Couple will write their wish in the pad lock n lock all the way of the staicase I had yummy pop corn in the top of namsan tower Surprisingly the coffee price is still normal price not like other tourist attraction I love namsan tower
2410,3,The tower is surrounded by lavish nature Since its a little old dont expect hightech features The position on a hill gives it a little edge to have a 360 degrees look on Seoul There is a nice souvenirs shop on top and a candy shop underneath it
2411,4,both of us take train then take the public bus there to seoul tower at nightrealy nice view can see the city therev take a lot of picture thereas v went at nightthe light all seems awesomei just feel like so romanticso lovely nnnn sweet at this placethus you must bring your couples there to enjoy this beautiful scene n capture the beautiful scene in koreavisit korea must visit seoul toweryeah
2412,5,The views from the top of the tower are absolutely spectacular If you take the cable car up you will probably have at least an hour long line Then when you get to the tower you will have another 30  45 minute long line so take the wait into account when planning your trip Seeing the view at night with the lights of the city is amazing
2413,5,We went up the tower in bright sunshine and had perfect view If the weather is dull postpone the visit
2414,4,Nice view of Seoul the restaurant requires a reservationI am not 100 sure I didnt go there the helps put Seoul into perspective for me always
2415,2,This is our second time there in ten years Namsan tower is not what it used to be The place is so overcrowded and dirty The line to ride the cable car is so long and once you get on you cant even enjoy the view because so many people are on that you cant look out When youre finally at the tower you cant enjoy the view because of the smog In addition the crowd is so immense you cant enjoy it or take pictures Stay away and spend your time and energy elsewhere
2416,5,I choose to get Namsan Tower by Cable Car due to my Hotel near Myeongdong then I need to walk from Hotel Pacific area you need trekking to find Cable Car station it takes 15 mins then enjoy the view from Cable car once you arrive prepare your feet to go upstairs and Finally you find a super beautiful Namsan Tower enjoy the coolest photo spot museum teddy bear dont forget to go the observatory and also shopping cute things a lot my suggest is buy cable car ticket for return for saving Happy explore Namsan 
2417,4,The locks are not as beautiful as in the KDramas Buying locks here is quite expensive About 20000 won The stairs from the 4th floor to the 3rd floor of the sheep show are quite fun That is a beautiful shooting location
2418,4,After 30 minutes of pain from the rather steep stairs cable car available for lazies the views from the top are well worth it As in most other similar places the top floor is quite crowded but the floor below offers more or less similar angles and less hustle Nice videos projected on the ceiling of the elevator during the up or down rides
2419,4,Must visit this tower because it is the iconic landmark if you come to Seoul You can view the Seoul city from the above and it is very spectacular
2420,3,They say you have not been to Seoul Korea if you have not visited N Seoul Tower  As part of our tour package we were allowed to stay and take pictures for 15 mins only Hope to have stayed longer and checked out the observatory  Must visit
2421,5,Must visit this famous NSeoul tower Namsan is famous seoul mountain and view is fantastic Good food lots of gift places
2422,4,A friend took us up the hill at night to see this spot Although we did not go up the tower or ride the cable car we loved the view from up here 360 and very very interesting
2423,5,Definitely I recommend the visit to the tower during the evening time The tower is on the top of a hill you can get there by cable car very very long line during the evening and weekend if possible better to avoid the weekend or by foot it is a very nice walking of about 30min I spend 2hours on queue to take the cable carITS NOT A PANORAMIC trip like usual  it takes about 1520ppl per time and its just to reach the tower then if you want to get to the top of the tower you need to buy another ticket Saturday night another 1hour queue Anyhow once there is nice cause there are lots of activities to do take pics to a temple restaurants games center love lockers wall Going to the top you can take and purchase a cool pics and I recommend the visit 
2424,4,Very nice view and great relaxing feeling while strolling along hill You can see distance between districts clearly and elevator ride was quick too
2425,5,It is located on the hill in the center of the city and offers a great view on the city which spreads as far as one can see in all directions If you have time get up there in the late afternoon and wait there until dark It is worth it
2426,2,They used to have a light show on the tower but seems its not napping anymore and thats the only they had which was cool But still its good to go there on sunset and enjoy the Seoul view And of course for couples its a very popular destinations to leave a lock there Lol
2427,4,I didnt expect this place to be as awesome as it was Not exactly sure what it was  maybe the views from the toilet Really from floor to ceiling windows with a view of Seoul while you sit and potty Soooo cool Great fun photo opportunities good snacks and even martial arts displaysshows but just the breathtaking views from the top  really worth it
2428,4,Lovely Views from the tower at nighttime or evening go around 78pm when the lights are coming on Its much more romantic We hung around for it to get dark which was a good choice to make Would return 
2429,5,I was fortunate enough to be staying across the street from the hillside entrance to N Seoul Tower so I took advantage of my proximity and hiked the hillside one morning The climb isnt easy to dress appropriately but once youve reached the tower the view makes it all worth while Ive been told that the view is hit or miss based on the level of yellow dust in the city but I was fortunate enough to have a perfect view of the bustling enormous city below Take an additional trip at night for a spectacular view
2430,5,we went there and it is good place to see Seoul from the top It will take not more than one hour tour and you can have a snak there also
2431,4,We went up with light shower  came down with heavy rain Even though we still enjoyed this trip due to few reasons It was nice to try the walk elevator train and cable car all the way up  down The temperature was nice  the views were great The tower is beautiful and the photo service was nicely designed with very reasonable price It costs less then 20USD to go round trip cable car  tower lift which is quite reasonable  
2432,4,The tower is located at the hill top We chose to go up the hill by cable car However the cable car station is located at a place that not convenient for visitors  The tower itself is not tall The entrance fee is expensive as it does not offer much different from the sightseeing spots at the hill top The day I visited did not have many visitors and made my visit very comfortable I do not know if they do not have many visitors every day  There are a lot of restaurants beneath the tower
2433,3,Maybe it was weekend it was very crowded from cable car to entrance to skydeck Recommend you to take bus to top hill bus line 03 02 05 instead of waiting in long queue Entrance to skydeck was through photo zone which is not neccessary and waste time
2434,5,Easy to access by subway and then buscheaper than guided tour Exceptional views from all levels Good facilities
2435,4,Ive been to a restaurant on the top of the tower It was very romantic  N grill on the top has also good atmosphere I had really good time with my boyfriend
2436,4,We walked from Myeongdong station Go right at the Pacific Hotel roadfork to get to the cablecar station The cablecar ride was squeezy  with everyone standing it was hard to get a good view for photo or video It was misty so we did not pay to get up to the observatory The environment was pleasant enough We had a relaxed bus ride back down to the metro station using our Tmoney card
2437,3,It was raining when we went there and it was foggy Could barely see the city from above Nice coolingarea during the summer
2438,5,Our teenage daughters loved visiting the Tower Lots to see Take the cable car up to the Tower grounds It was hot when we went but if cooler you can walk up and down Lots of places in food court Great Bubble Tea
2439,4,Its a hike up the hill but the view from the top was fantastic We went there after a long day of sightseeing and were worn out so the hike up was tiring but worth it
2440,4,Nice attraction with great views of the city See all the locks and relive your favorite Kdrama moment
2441,5,Almost every place has its own iconic tower So this is a mustgo if its your first time to Seoul just for that been there done that picture Its accessible from Myeongdong anyway so why not
2442,3,Unfortunately this overlook is famous as a dating spot in a country rife with couples culture Expect lots of tourists and couples crowding this area during weekends and evenings That said it is a pretty dang decent view if you can peek out from over the crowds and lovelock infested railings I would certainly recommend to hike up the mountain and arrive just before sunset You will be tired enough to want to lounge around until the dusk which gives you the benefit of seeing the city in the daylight the colors of the sunset and the lights after dark There is a cable car you can use to get back down or you can hike it again for another workout
2443,4,I visited here on Aug 13 by cable car located in mid point of Mt Nam You can enjoy night view of Seoul I recommend you to visit here late afternoon Cable car cost of adult is 8500 KRW for round trip and 5500 KRW for oneway trip You can find lots of restaurant coffe shop and souvenior shop in the N tower The nearest subway station of cable car boarding is myuong dong subway station
2444,4,It was our last day in Seoul and even though it was a cloudy day we decided to give this a shot We got there early and rode the first tram up and it wasnt crowded It was a weekday tooNice views on the tram but you get the same at the top so if the tram has a line take a taxi or bus or if you have time and in good shape you can walk up to the base of the tower We went to the top of the tower but you could see that a lot of people dont as the view at the base is pretty good The view from the top of the tower was worth it as you have great views of the city but the clouds kept us from seeing to far in the distance
2445,3,This is one of the main landmarks in Seoul the waiting lines were dredful line to the cable car to the elevator etc The view to the tower is amazing cuz its in Namsan park but to tell the truth it wasnt really that much you can do up there haha
2446,4,The tower its self is great We much more enjoyed the 2nd level as it was less crowded and you got a nicer view the 2nd level also had more information unlike the top that just seems to be about getting kids to ask their parents for lollies  We took the cable car up They PACK the people in so if you dont rush to a side of the cart you basically cant see anything The cart ride isnt great so if i was to do it again i would just get the bus up  Once you get to the base of the tower its then more money to get up I understand they need to pay for everything but it really does feel like a tourist trap  The view was great and Id recommend going at sunset so you can start to see Seoul light up and do its thing  Worth going but dont stress if you dont have time
2447,4,No taxi is allowed for direct access and we took the bus nr 2 directly out side the hotel A little climbing act led us to the Tower Square where we bought the entrance tickets for half price after 1800pm The lift drive has a quick view of the N Tower from space Be aware the timing of going back as long queues are awaiting yours There are impressive breathtaking views on how Seoul survived from the wars With so many bridges and clusters of tall buildings around Soul shows her perseverance and determination to sustain growth inside this compact wellknitted localities
2448,5,This was my second attempt at checking out the tower The first day it was too much smog so I decided not to go up to the top At the end of the week I tried again and I was so glad that I did I used the cable cars to gain access which offered great views At the end of the cable car ride was a performance area food bar and more views Then I purchased a ticket to go up to the tower it was nice with more great views picture opportunities and a gift shop
2449,4,The views from the top of the tower are beautiful but it can get very crowded the you get to the top The tower itself will be lit up at night and is great for pictures Its nice to look at from afar
2450,4,A paronamic view of the city Seoul landscape tall building surrounded by large patches of forest trees consistently seen at 360 degree view from the N Seoul Tower It is interesting to notice that when we were downtown city ground level the surrounding was humid But as we board the cable car we begin to see the wide areas of greeneries and felt the whip of fresh cool air late afternoon Awesome view forest trees all across the city of Seoul
2451,5,One of the Icon of Seoul City N Seoul Tower is very nice place to spend your afternoon especially in Autumn I would recommend this place for couple because is very romantic
2452,1,Nothing really impressed me in SK this one in particular is nothing to be excited about the same stench in the street surrounding the place the oils and filthy water from the street vendors kiosks running on the side of the streets is just disgusting
2453,4,Seoul Tower in South Korea Namsan Tower  Seoul Tower also called Namsan Tower or more recently N Seoul Tower is located in the centre of Seoul on Mount Namsan Seoul Tower was opened to the public for the first time on the 15th of October 1980 Namsan Tower is 2367 metres high and because it stands on Namsan Seoul Towertop of Mount Namsan it rises to about 480 metres above sea level thus allowing visitors to enjoy a great panoramic view of Seoul  Seoul Tower was remodelled in 2005 and it opened to the public again on the 9th of December 2005 with the name of N Seoul Tower N stands for new The new tower has a new lighting system that makes the tower spectacular at night; new facilities such as restaurants shops cafes; a lobby with a media zone where films and music videos are shown for free; two pavilions one for exhibitions and the other for performances; two observatories the new digital observatory with new state of the art digital telescopes and the classic analogue observatory; a new revolving western style restaurant called N Grill on the top floor
2454,5,You might have to climb up or drive up but the view is really worth it It is quite a tourist attraction and is quite busy and of a welcoming atmosphere I suggest coming near the evening to afternoon as the view is beautiful and the N Seoul Tower will light up which is quite spectacular It is definitely a great destination to take pictures and just look over Seoul and as well as that the railings of stairs are chained with beautiful colourful locks that you can purchase quite expensive though If you want to purchase a lock and key I suggest going to the actual store to buy the locks rather than people standing around on the platforms Other than that it was definitely worth the experience As well as that inside there are restaurants souvenirs walls where you can write stuff on and an arcade which I enjoyed greatly Definitely worth a visit if you ever go to Seoul
2455,4,Stunning views or Seoul specially at sunset when the city lights start to light up You will have the whole city at your feet
2456,5,Amazing view of the whole of Seoul With lots of interesting shopsactivities on the lower levels Spent a pleasant morning with teenage family who enjoyed it
2457,4,Its a tower which gives amazing panoramic views of Seoul city Especially in the evening Half way up it has its own lovelock platform Souvenirs usually are a tad on the costlier side but the views are breathtaking Worth a visit for anyone who is visiting Seoul
2458,4,The N Seoul Tower is about a 10 minute walk from Myeong Dongs busy streets Its really easy to get there and there are many ways to get to the tower bus taxi private car cable car or by walking  We purchased a round trip ticket 8500 won to take the cable car However I would RECOMMEND PURCHASING A SINGLE TRIP 6500 and walk down you can see the amazing views of seoul as you make your way down plus it is relatively easy to walk down with the cool wind keeping you nice and cool Really peaceful  There are quite a few restaurants and cafes at the base of the tower which are reasonably priced There are souvenir shops and an Olive Young beauty store We didnt go up to the tower but stayed at the base of the tower to admire the views the views were nice enough at the base If you are a couple go to the Love tunnel Stay from 7pm to 9pm to see the sun set and the city night lights If you are with friends and family battle it out at the game arcade 1000 won per game
2459,5,I was a bit nervous taking the cable car to the tower but I really enjoyed it  I would to it again I visited the tower at night lots of nice things around the foot of the tower  shops food bars and artwork The view at night was very good would like to have done it during the day too Its cheap to go up the tower and it was worth doing
2460,5,N Seoul Tower is not very tall in comparison to other towers but the attraction was very worthwhile Admission is about 8500 won approx 8 USD which includes a cable car ride to the tower base offering great city views Try going near sundown to get a clear view of the city sunset and city lights The colorful love locks are a great attraction gimmick Great for couples
2461,4,I used to go here often when I had visitors They charge to go up there but if you eat at one of the restaurants you dont have to pay for the ticket The food is relatively expensive around 40 per head but the restaurant food is really good and well worth it You can choose where to eat and what you like Definitely worth going  It gets busy during the weekend so better to avoid then
2462,4,A nice place and well worth visiting with your loved one There is a big focus on celebrating love  Quite a boring walk up and down well worth getting the bus
2463,4,We walked up a little way in the park to get to Seoul Tower What is great about the tower is that you do not have to go to the top to see the view as it is on top of a high point The base is great as it has lots of platforms on many levels which all have free access and provide great views of the city The love locks all over it are very cute and colourful If you do want to go to the top it is also reasonably priced Recommend a visit
2464,4,Main attraction is the Observation deck offering an astonishing 360 degree panoramic view over the city That why it is so popular with the locals and visitors Although its touristy it is still one of the must see when in Seoul There is also a spacious wooden deck on top of the N Plaza whose exotic atmosphere makes it very popular with lovers The Locks of Love attraction where thousands of padlocks attached to the fence by romantics Seoulites and visitors symbolizing their undying love and affection There are numerous restaurants in the plaza There is an entrance fee to go up the observation deck but it is free to enjoy the rest of the attractions in the park
2465,4,We spent almost three hours in this place Its an amazing view of Seoul 360 degrees Some good restaurants and coffee shops at the base of the tower We were surprised to find the Love Locks in an area when you get off the Sky Lift Its amazing to see the 100 of thousands of Locks place on the railings in the area I was told its better to go up there at night to view the lights around the city but we enjoyed our afternoon visit
2466,3,The view was okay You can take a cable car up to the tower or you can walk it up the hill There are better things to do than getting up on the tower
2467,4,The cable car ride up to the tower is enjoyable Seoul is not an attractive city so views arent spectacular but worth going up the tower to look out over this enormous city We had a very clear day with good views to the mountains The area at the top near the tower is quite pleasant also
2468,3,Weve been in many towers around the globe and this one probably excited us the least Though you can have a good view of the city and maybe the sunset timing in a clear sky day would make it much better There is a free shuttle bus which can bring you there from the nearest subway station to avoid climbing the hill walking Ask your hotel for information The cable car cost 8500 and the tower ticket another 10000 Almost 20 USDpers  maybe a bit too much Enjoy
2469,4,I walked up to the cable car station from my hostel I visited N Seoul Tower in the evening very nice view I enjoyed my time here
2470,5,The observation deck is absolute amazing Not only its the tallest point in Seoul it has beautiful unobstructed view Its pure and fantastic If you come to Seoul definitely need to come here
2471,5,On a clear night a fantastic view of one of the most vibrant cities of the world plenty of gastro choices and ways to get up to the mount
2472,5,quick visit of tower on May2017 well organized and good facilities available  i walked all the way to top of the hill  there was a long queue at cable car station due to weekend but my plan was walking even before i arrived to station  would like to suggest visitor to go there but not on weekends 
2473,5,Affordable tickets to view all of Seoul from the tower  The souvenirs sold inside are also affordable  Went there during the day  Will try going during the night next time
2474,3,The tower was quite high and one can see the view of Hanyang River However I didnt enjoy it was it was foggy that evening Perhaps it was due to postrain Maybe if it was sunny it would have been a better experience
2475,5,A must if you are in seoul coz this is the symbol of seoul just search for the internet on how to get here and be ready to walk uphill you can also find here the famous love locks
2476,3,I did not go there but noted that several duty free shops were giving out its entry tickets as gifts for purchases So for those that would shop at duty free shops just take the chance to get the free tickets then Enjoy
2477,4,little far from central seoul tower is a good tourist spot surrounded with greenery and beautiful view it is one of the must visit places in seoul you can visit this place in city tour bus or a taxi which is not cheap in seoul 12 hours are enough for this spot overall worth a visit
2478,5,I really like this place Me and my friend didnt take a cableway we walked the way up It was in late August very hot weather during the day but it was worth in the huge queue If you like walking you can do it Its really nice way up with super clean toilets and nice views Up we bought tickets waited something around 3040 minutes you can take pictures etcno big deal and then went up by escalator The view on the city is breathtaking I really recommend We had a nice weather so we saw longer distance choose to go there where there is a nice weather There is a space to take pictures And the last recommendation Use the bathroom The view from toilets is one of the best I have ever had from that type of place 
2479,4,Well would it be very weird to say that highlight of my visit was toilet trip The thing is that there are cabins with panoramic view there and I bet you gonna take couple of pictures while there Apart from that N Tower is the highest city viewing deck and I guess that in sunny weather view is awesome On my visit day it was a bit foggy Cable cars were closed that day so I had to get there by bus and on the way back I had to wait for ages to get back to the city That was the only downside The park around tower is nice as well
2480,4,Dont forget to ride the cable car when going up Your camera and of course your special someone Its where love birds can have a date hehe
2481,5,Suggest to visit during evening time and you can have a good view of Seoul city as well as the sunset Night time might be a little crowded Take a short cable car ride to reach the bottom of Seoul tower where you can find an observatory deck some cafes and restaurants
2482,4,You can come to N Seoul Tower either by cable car or bus better still to try both We took cable car on the way there and took bus on the way back to town Very nice view from the tower top and the cool weather is another plus point
2483,2,I had read that the activities around the tower were fun so we went up to the tower even though it was raining and overcast Maybe the activities would be fun for a small child but I was not entertained The toy museum and the hello kitty museum just looked kind of pathetic from the outside so we didnt pay to go in those The arcade was sad mostly claw machines we had already experienced a claw machine arcade and lost several thousand won because the claw jolts too much
2484,5,Namsan Tower has nice view because you can see beautiful cities Seoul city on top of Namsan Tower I prefer to go at night than noon the reason why when you go at night you can see a beautiful lights And if we purchase with MasterCard we can get a 15 discount
2485,5,One of the mustdothings when visiting Seoul The view from the top of the tower was beautiful Tickets can be purchased from various websites online which are generally cheaper than buying on the spot
2486,4,Nice aerial view of Seoul The easiest way to get there is on the Hop On Hop Off bus But its dufficult for PWDs and senior citizens to climb the steep slope
2487,3,Because involving walking uphill a bit to get therequite sweating eventhough its autumn hehethe view from tower and love padlock thing quite amusingworth to see
2488,5,Incredible views of city If you hike up the hill you will get a major workout Definitely recommend it to anyone visiting
2489,4,The tower is an icon in Seoul It also messages air quality to the masses with its color displays Best part about the tower is the great hiking trails all around The city wall trail even courses nearby
2490,4,Easy to combine with visits to Namdeon market and Myeongdong district The cable car trip was short and enjoyable The additional ticket up the tower was worth it as you can appreciate the shear expanse of the city and pockets of diversity Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful
2491,4,A pleasant visit We take the bus to go up and walk down on return Not many people and we could enjoy the time If the weather was better would make this visit perfect
2492,5,The view from the top of N Seoul Tower is amazing and the cable car ride up is also stunning From Myeongdong station its not a long walk to the cable car station though it is all uphill with a decent set of stairs at the end There is also a shuttle bus from Myeongdong station to the cable car but we just walked N Seoul Tower should definitely be done at night when the tower is lit up and so is all of Seoul One of the most amazing things about the tower is definitely the bathrooms make sure you pay them a visit before you head back down We didnt spent long at the top its actually a pretty small area there is a small gift shop and lolly shop however the gift shop at the base of the tower has a much better range
2493,5,This is one of the stops in the Hop On Hop Off Bus A Its a long climb up the hill but the view is worth it at the Observation deck We already tried the N Seoul Burger with fries and drinks and it was actually good to the palate Love lock is where couples put their names in padlocks along the perimeter walls  Suggest you stay for only an hour or two at the most so one can try the other stops in the bus
2494,4,We took the cable car up and then went to the top of the tower The views were beautiful Even at the bottom of the tower there are great views of the city so if you dont want to spend the money on tickets it would be worth going to the area We bought our tickets from Klook which gave a discount
2495,4,Seoul Tower is easily accessible by a few number of buses we can see the Seoul City all around however the tower is not so tall there are a number of restaurants and starbuck coffee to serve you if you have time I will recommend you to go
2496,4,I was lost in exchanging my ticket from my discover Seoul pass It was disappointing It was rainy in Seoul but I have to see the place as it says its a must see Im a tourist and the locals they can hardly speak English  The ticketing iffice asked me to go down in exchange of ticket the other ones asked me to go up My pass expires and I cant get no ticket but with some rage in my face at least the ticketing office issued me Misunderstanding misleading and nothing special here Rode a cable car for a fee since its slippery and raining
2497,5,I believe it is a most visit place in Seoul  I love how it is located at top of mountain Very beautiful views at the way to Tower very green forest and I saw many people hiking to the tower The ticket is not experience and there are many good romantic places that lovers would love to see and leave some memories For example writing on walls Hanging locks Also many shop stors that offer beautiful souvenirs but they are expansive Also there are areas for children to play
2498,4,Pulling out your camera and take the best toilet view in Seoul The sign said you can and encourage you to  pointing out the windows of course
2499,5,Went with my friends it was beautiful Since it rained when we were there we just bought some ice cream and chilled at one of the covered decks near the restaurants
2500,5,We booked our Namsan Tower tickets through Trazycom as it was cheaper than buying on site We did not have to queue up at the ticket counter and we went up the tower without wasting any time queueing up The view from the tower at night was breathtaking There was bus service to the tower from different parts of town A must visit attraction of Seoul
2501,5,Wow 88 floors up Super fast elevators breath taking views Even though it was raining on the day we went up the tower it was well worth it
2502,5,We walked around 10 minute from Myeongdong station where our hotel was located to the cable car spot The roundtrip ticket to Seoul tower was W8000 but the line was a bit long The views were spectacular at night and there are also lots of cute spots like the tunnel of love and entertainment places Going up the Seoul tower is also not expensive but the views are really nice
2503,5,A must see for everyone visiting seoul HiTech elevator Gives you the feel of ascending up in the sky Make sure to pose for a nice souvenir picture youll have to pay 12000 won if you like it though But its worth it youll get to choose different background The love locks are cute but gets too crowded so try to come as early as possible to get a better  clear picture spot Enjoy 
2504,3,A good walk to lift not a good idea if its a summers day and humid We got the single trip up and got the bus back Good to see traffic when not driving Unfortunately didnt see to far due to smog  It was still good to see how vast the city is
2505,5,The observation deck is worth to go We enjoyed the night view of Seoul City with its complex street lights and beautiful mountains surrounding the city  Some good gimmicks are put on the glass windows which tells you how far other cities in the world is from the tower
2506,5,Enjoyed every bit in here A great place for a photoop or just chilling at one of the cafes One of Seouls landmarks
2507,3,Our hotel has a shuttle that dropped us off at the cable car so we decided to take that up to the tower Also because some family members did not wear appropriate shoes It was earlier in the morning so no line at all The cable car ride only took about 10 minutes Youre in between trees so the view is just ok I would have preferred to walk up and recommend it for anyone who is capable and willing  Walking around underneath the tower there were some areas with ok views Unfortunately it was a little smoggy that day so you cant see very clearly for long We got a couple ice cream cones and sat in the back with tables and panoramic glass window looking towards Gangnam Unfortunately the would be relaxing experience was many times ruined by people dragging chairs across the concrete that creates the most horrific high pitched sound  Given the less than ideal visibility we didnt pay additional to go up to the top of the tower I think if the weather was better especially if you have a clear night that would have been much nicer
2508,4,You can visit the N S Tower day or night there are some great views of the city There is a metro station at the bottom of the hill but it is a steep walk up even to get the cable car It will depend how fit you are There was a show on during our visit which my husband enjoyed but I found it deafening There are other viewing towers in Seoul for example the Lotte Tower which is newer and higher but it is more expensive We didnt go up the Lotte Tower because we had already gone up the N S Tower My advice would be to choose one tower as to do them all is pricey for a similar view If there are an Elvis Presley fans reading There is a small free museum that might be worth 10 minutes of your time It is run by a husband and wife who are obvious fans It is at the beginning of the hill on your left going up Nice Pasta and Pizza coffee shop on the opposite side of the street Sorry cant remember the name There are eating places up in the tower area but they are more expensive
2509,5,N Seoul Tower is a mustgoto place when in Seoul The best time to be there is an hour before sunset That way you can see the city daytime and then transition to nighttime Be prepared for an uphill walk leading to the cable car and leading to the tower itself You can get discounts for the cable car when booked online 
2510,4,The night view is fabulous There are several ways to go there Cable car buses taxi walk I recomend take buses with a bit of walk to top
2511,4,Located atop Namsan Hill right in the middle of metropolitan Seoul the N Seoul Tower is a mustsee attraction whenever you are in this city As with any mighty lofty tower you can be assured of a breathtaking view all round but the extent of what you can see is dependent on the weather Nevertheless it is still a worthwhile visit as the journey there is an adventure itself  strenuous uphill walking nervy cable car ride and earpopping speedy ride up the highspeed lift Oh do check out the toilet at the observatory deck which comes with a view to kill for
2512,5,I decided to walk up and even tho I was lost 1 hour b4 I found the right path I do not regret this site I walked from my hotel and it was worth the walk There is lots of stairs up to where the tower is You can definitely walk I am not that athletic but it was ok to walk up I rested few times There was a place to take pictures half way upgood place to rest your tired legs Dont forget to bring water When I was up there the tower isi decided NOT to go up on the tower Bcuz the wiew was so awesome at where I was that the tower it self was not needed Ofc for those that want to go up to the towerits worth it I am surebut I just sat there on til of that mountainunder the tower and watched ppl and the wiew That was one of my best moments in Seoulso lovely I drank coffee at the cafe and the wiew was like a dream I warmly recommend this experience I walked down the mountain tooit was much easier to go down 
2513,4,Must see this place You get a great view of the city of Seoul Its beautiful in the spring as the trees and flowers add a touch of colors to the surrounding and cooler temperature too
2514,5,We walk from Myeongdong to the Tower it was little bit tiring but it was worth for the view on the Seoul tower We enjoy the sunset and the view and of course the beautiful night Theres a souvenir shop and few restaurant there Nice place to visit when u in Seoul
2515,5,We had our first experiences touching snow here and its so memorable for us Nice view and a place for couple
2516,5,It provides good view of the city Theres a mall inside so you can get some stuff and souvenirs but a bit pricy Locks of love is romantic even at day time We went there by bus which was a good idea than walking since were not used to long walks and its uphill Very tiring If you plan to put locks there bring your pen You have to pay for a pen We felt shy to borrow 
2517,2,If you are feeling energetic you can walk up to the Tower if not theres a cable car The Tower itself is just an excuse to part you from your money with lots of shopping and eating opportunities The view is probably best at sunset but during the day theres a lot of smog and frankly all there is to see is high rise buildings for miles in all directions
2518,4,To get to this place you either take a cable car or climb all the way up 15 kilometers This is a tower that can overlook the whole of Seoul But to access the top you would need an entry fee of about 10000 won
2519,3,We went in the evening The observation deck was quite small Views were quite nice Public transport can get quite crowded Toilets have a great view though 
2520,4,We walked up to the tower in 20 minutes it was not as challenging as we originally thought Once you reach the base of the tower there are a number of restaurants and shops The views of Seoul were amazing and it was well worth for a visit  However as the views were so good from the base we decided not to go up the tower
2521,4,Very good to explore Seoul from the top of the tower Many restaurants at the tower that you can have dinner with your family in any special occasion
2522,4,My wife and I went to the Tower in the evening for 2 reasons  eat at the N Grill restaurant on the top floor and see the views Luckily we had a sunny evening so we were treated to stunning views of the sunset over Seoul You are very high up and so the views are amazing I thought the Observatory Deck was pretty much the only attraction but I was really surprised to see that there is actually quite a bit to see and do there with a lot of shops on each floor So I recommend you allow for about 2 hours of time there Getting there is very easy cable car or a bus If by bus take the number 2 bus from Chungmuro Station outside the cinema and it takes about 20 minutes to the Tower stop From there its a five minute walk uphill to the Tower
2523,4,Seoul Namsan tower or NSeoul tower is one of the popular land mark in Seoul You can enjoy the whole view of Seoul from the top of the tower There are traditional program are being held everyday in the evening time Recommended to visit at good day when the sky is clean If you want to enjoy the night view visit in evening or night time You cannot go there by taxi Take bus form Chungmuro station
2524,5,Love the new outlook of namshan tower Fresh air Love locks expanded Best place for sunset Would suggest the route via bus to namshan tower instead of the cable car
2525,5,We went to the tower just before sunset so we could capture both day and night views I have seen this in many kdramas so it was wonderful to see in person We decided to take the lift up but didnt realise how long the line was If you dont mind walking up it may save you some time The tower is impressive and there are many photo opportunities around We didnt go up the tower as it was an additional cost and the day we went was foggy hindering good views We felt it wouldnt add many city views as the free areas had fabulous cityscape views There are a lot of exhibitions to look at but some are additional costs The highlight of these exhibition has to be the stunning dresses in the hanbok museum
2526,4,For people who like to write and send out postcards  heres the perfect place to do it They sell lovely postcards up at the tower and theres a very convenient postbox just for sending out them Its a great view up there and youll be able to take beautiful pictures in a fine day Theres also the fence down at the tower for couples to hang their love lockets onto it and take some memorable photos around Overall its a relaxing place to chill out and quite a romantic place for couples to hang out
2527,5,Came here with my boyfriend During the day its nice with a lot of vendors and families out walking around eating street food At night its more of a date spot with only couples walking around taking photos writing their initials on love locks and locking them on the bridge holding hands etc Its very romantic
2528,4,We enjoyed going up to N Tower on our first afternoon In hindsight not sure Id go again The cable car was OK after waiting 45mins  being crammed in The complex is looking  feeling old Nice view though and good place to get your bearings
2529,5,This is a must see attraction Take the cable car to access it and enjoy the calm even when it is crowded Vegetation surrounds your path Soothing
2530,5,There is a nice view also with a cable car Better if it was sunny Nice park under the tower so you can walk down
2531,4,This is a great spot a mustsee on your trip to Seoul The Tower offers the best views of the city even if you dont pay to go up inside the tower itself There are buses and a cable car that will take you mostly to the top of the hill There are also hiking paths accessible from more than one spot There is handicapped parking available if you drive but it isnt exactly clear how to drive up there Food vendors Hello Kitty shop and other shops available for souvenirs And of course lots of photos ops
2532,5,Love the view from Namsan Tower night view definetely the best time to go I did both day and night I really recomend night time as it is more calmer and romantic
2533,3,I am confident that the views are great from the tower but by just walking around the tower entrance area you can see how it is full of rip offs like expensive museums sweets coffee etc if thats your thing then do it I did enjoy the great free views around the park and if the tier itself from the outside though
2534,3,I will said there is nothing special Because i was there during day time and you can have some nice view and the weather is cool
2535,2,It was more interesting at the bottom of the tower than the top Some towers stand out due to architecture some due to the elevators some due to the educational value some due to props inside  Unfortunately this tower didnt stand out for any positive attributes It wasnt very educational or special in any way  Health warning If you have photosensitive epilepsy DO NOT go to this attraction There are no warning signs nor does anyone try warn you of anything out of norm  I dont have this condition but I got really dizzy in the elevator They turn on really loud thumping music with flashing lights of a fake night sky I want to say there were mirrors all around to make the elevator feel bigger and it intensified the experience It felt like a rave party in there and youre trapped until the elevator opens Due to the discomfort the ride for me probably felt longer than it really was  In my opinion the special effects were totally unwarranted I rather they spend the money into giving some scientific information about the tower and landscape at the top
2536,4,We went here on our first day in Seoul and it is a good escape from the busy city it is still busy but as it is set in the mountains and in a forest you escape the built up areas We went up n the cable car which can get very busy Im told but was a reasonable wait when we went Go on weekdays The views were amazing and it was a really nice experience
2537,4,You can see the panoramic view of Seoul from NSeoul Tower It will be also very crowded as its one of the main attraction of Seoul Too much couples everywhere Hahaha am sad loljk  Unfortunately didnt try the love lock haha Hmmm maybe next time P
2538,3,Located at Mount Namsan right smack in the middles of Seoul it offers the best 360 view of the whole city Often the site of Kdrama scenes its become more popular lately so I suggest to go there early before bus loads of tourists arrive The mall below opens at 10am so with the food outlets  Theres access via cable car to the tower so you can rest your tired feet and reserve your energy for more of Seouls other attractions Namsan is also a popular park where a lot of people jog walk or just roam around specially in the mornings For lovers you can bring a padlock which you can lock and leave there as a similar to Paris Dont leave Seoul without visiting
2539,5,Theres just so much to do and pictures to take A must see in Seoul but walking up to the tower was a nightmare have some water and good shoes youll need it
2540,4,Namsan tower is one of the main spot to visit in Seoul We enjoyed walking up to the tower and the scenery around is very nice We enjoyed nice city view from the tower
2541,4,i would recommend visiting Namsan tower during dusk That way you get to see Seoul in the daylight and also at night the view at night is really spectacular bring a jacket with you if the wind is strong you will get cool pretty quick  as it happened to us in May 2017 unfortunately during our visit the tower was restricted but the views from the lower floors was just as great we went there by the municipal bus which was cheap and easy we caught the bus near a Myeong Dong metro station and it only took 20 mins and cost us KRW 1200 The bus will bring you all the way up to the tower but when you are ready to go home  do get to the bus stop when there is no queue because if there is a long queue  you might end up standing in the bus due to the large number of passengers also going home i dont advise walking  its a really long and hard climb from the bottom of the hill to Namsan tower there are a number of restaurants up there  we ended up eating burgers with a fantastic view of Seoul city but if you are on a budget there is a convenience store near the Namsan bus stop  which sells instant noodle pots and some snacks
2542,4,We came here to see the night view Its about 10mins by taking cable carbut its full of people lined up for 30mins It took us lots of time to line up and take transportation form central city but the view truly worth waiting Its a nice place for couples so romantic to overview the city at night
2543,4,Namsan tower is very nice spot It is very nice also challenging path to walk up to the tower but the scenery around is very nice The views to the city from the tower was pretty awesome especially at the sunset However there were so many tourists round to pose pictures that we couldnt get a space to enjoy the view
2544,5,mall    Good for couple Good night viewing You can bring a lock and lock at there with you and your partner name in it
2545,3,It costs 10000 won to get up there with the elevator and youre glased in a room with a bunch of expensive souvenir and giftshops No balconies or rooftop acces The staff is friendly though
2546,5,Its a very big tourist spot We visited this place on a Wednesday night It was difficult to find from the Metro But we had a nice walk through the small winding steep roads There is an easy access elevator to use but we were on the wrong path The views from the tower were great since it was clear day The shops were a little pricey
2547,4,Unfortunately in South Korea very few days are clearEven with this in mind NST is a great destination and a must visit if you are on a short trip to Korea We have been 3 separate times and enjoyed it each one I definitely recommend being at the top after dark to see all of the city lights
2548,5,This is tge new and improved N Seoul tower I was amazed by the view as well as the activities If you go check the schedule as there are live performances I even got a chance to spear a bamboo pole The food is great the kids can visit an arcade as well as see how far away they are from home Dont forget to go on the sky tram and also have you camera ready Wasnt expecting it but we spent the entire day there Great fun and you could actually go for free
2549,2,This was a disappointment There is nothing especially notable in Seoul skyline You cant see anything due to the smog and the dirty windows
2550,3,Better go up by cable car its much special Go in the evening and see the sunset the view is nice and its comfortable to walk around the peak Landmark of Seoul
2551,5,This iconic land mark sits high atop the hill in Seoul Take the tram up This is particularly spectacular at night when its lit up with colored lights
2552,5,At this place you can spend the whole day using the cable car is a very nice experience Arriving at the top gives you the option to walk down or to resue the cable car Every level of the tower has a lot of thing to see including kids activities The only problem is you need to pay for every thing 8 to use the cable car and then at each level you may need to pay similar amount to visit some place
2553,5,Seoul tower by clear weather is really nice  Seoulite atmosphere by night  If there is a long queue for the cable car you can walk as well 
2554,5,I just returned from the tower after not having known what to expect Id be underselling the experience if I didnt say it exceeded my best expectations Ive really grown to love Korea and plan on visiting again in the near future The park itself is immaculate with well maintained trails that are somewhat physically taxing but the average person will be just fine There are also cable cars for those less inclined to get to the top on foot Halfway up the trail youll find a few places to grab a few items to both eat and drink The view gets increasingly more beautiful as you climb with the top offering a spectacular and unobstructed view of beautiful Seoul Youll find plenty of options for both food and drink at the summit and tickets to the observation deck are moderately priced There is a quaint gift shop located here as well as more options to eat and drink All in all a great experience for solo travelers such as myself to couples and entire families of all ages
2555,2,Took the cable car up The views were nice but the tower felt like an abandoned mall not much else up there to do
2556,4,Fantastic views  the haze added to the scene Dined in the restaurant was surprised by the excellent quality of the food Well done for a major tourist venue
2557,4,We came here in the afternoon when we arrived from the airport We took the bus which stopped just near the entrance One climbs a few meters of quite a hilly portion We saw the heart locks area The observation deck is great Overlooking Seoul Restos are available
2558,5,Good place to visit to see the whole scenic view of Seoul Especially please plan to sit down on pizza spagetti area in 2nd placesYou can enjoy the food while watching scenery
2559,3,Visited in the evening and hordes of people had the same idea Long wait to go on cable car View is soso  I feel the time could have spent better elsewhere
2560,5,Its properly good for me and family for relaxing vacation I love this and I have plan to go there again
2561,5,Got the opportunity to go up tower just before dusk and able to see city fully in daylight and then after dark This should be on everyones first visit time to remember
2562,5,High on a hill above Seoul with panoramic wonderful views and everyone can see it especially at night time from street level
2563,5,One thing you need to understand when in South Korea you need to expect a lot of walking Like whole day walking  This is a great tourist spot to see Seoul in a panoramic view Love locks are also everywhere
2564,5,N Seoul Tower is just like any other touristy spot that offers a panoramic view of a city but I guess the selling point of this place for me is the journey going up to this tower The around 45minute taking a lot of rests on our way hike up was a breeze because there are proper concrete stairs and the surroundings filled with plants and trees definitely took my attention enough for me to forget that I have actually been climbing up the stairs for a while Dont forget to take a picture at one of the vantage points below the tower showing the juxta positioning of the industrial city and the mountains as a huge backdrop The lovers key park is also cute So if you want to have your own key lockedup in that park I highly suggest to bring your own lock in advance because the locks sold in the area is already so expensive Then the tower itself is also good So if you want to see the panoramic view of the city then the N Seoul Tower is a mustvisit place
2565,5,The Seoul Tower is a terrific way to see the entire city and surrounding hills On the way up the elevator ceiling becomes a video as if you were blasting into outer space To get to the tower there are some inclines and steps  my guide knew where the elevator was to avoid the steps After the tower there was a live performance going on in the plaza of traditional dances and music which was wee done Certainly worth the visit
2566,5,Must do in Seoul I have been to viewing towers in most cities we goto but this was different  You obviously see magnificent views of the Seoul city but there is more especially for children There are video game parlors 3d reality Restaurants Nice views etc etc  So plan to spend a good 23 hrs up there Its worth it
2567,5,After a cable car to access the Tower its 10000 each to get in to the lift to see the observation tower  You can get a discount if you buy a tube pass  10 percent off  When at the top the windows need a clean  the view could be clearer  Best to go at sunrise to get the nighttime view  Its open till 23 00 hrs  Crowded and very touristy prices for restaurants  avoid that  Views are good over Seoul  And you can take some nice pictures  There is a chance also to buy a love locket and express your eternal love for your partner  There are thousands of these  The queue to go down can be long and wait could be 10 to 15 mins to access cable car 
2568,4,Nice evening first time visit I have watched few dramas about this place we went there late but its good night out especially great for couple
2569,4,Ive been to korea a few times There is a few ways to get there Either you can take a short walk from Myeongdong Then take the oreumi elevator up to the cable car ticket counter Or take namsam sunhwan shuttle bus no 2 3 or 5 Both transportation way up will will show you the scenery of korea Its beautiful all year round and each season have something different to show
2570,5,Even though going up here need a lot of queuing From buying the ticket waiting for the tram going inside the tower going back down back to the team again But its all worth it From up there you can see 360 of Seoul When we were there we got lucky to see lotte world fire works Its AWESOME Dont forget to bring your love locks but dont worry they sold those there
2571,4,Really interesting place but if youre not with children that will ask you about icecream itll take 10 to 15 minutes to get everything from this place Good views when the weather is good
2572,5,A trip through this tallest tower is mind boggling It has 23 floors and it is is 183 feet The lift goes up the 19 floors exactly in one minute Inside the lift and while traveling on the lift the entire lift shows a led description of buildings around and also the sky as it reaches the top
2573,5,One can view most or entire Seoul area when you reach this peak A romantic place where one appreciates the beauty of the city
2574,5,Great views of the city and nice place to relax with a beer I caught the bus up easy as and then walked back down
2575,4,Fantastic views and rewarding hike to the top of the hill Be ready to climb not for folks capable of making the trek from the bottom there are buses and shuttles available to get you to the top Night time view of Seoul was particularly enjoyable and made the trip even more memorable
2576,5,Must see attraction  Make sure you plan for time to explore the park around the the tower Recommend you plan to spend time in the park and go up the tower a bit before sunset
2577,5,We walked up the hill from our hotel Hyatt and it we had lovely views all the way through the park Great views of Seoul and there are things to do up there We didnt go to the top of the tower but we did plenty of exploring just below
2578,4,This place can give you a breathtaking view of Seoul from the top Both day and night views are spectacular though I prefer the night view of Korea This place is very touristy and it is a bit pricey to go to the top however if it is your first time to visit Seoul then this is a must
2579,4,It is close to the heart of the city The cable was a interest experience of getting up the the tower But I would suggest to walk to the N tower from the bottom of the mountain as the park was with a lot of beautiful trees and flower A great place to refresh in the city
2580,3,Visited the Seoul Tower in March 2017 I dont see what the appeal is of this attraction I visited on a clear day I could see forever However the views simply are not that impressive  The tower is filled with tourist shops and restaurants with unimaginative menus The entire experience was quite boring  If you mustsee it once Be prepared to be underwhelmed
2581,5,Its an amazing N seoul Tower from our hotel in myeongdong we just take a bus 406 from Namdaemun gate until Namsan Library then we just walk going uphill its worth walking to see the beautiful ambiance of the namsan park Very beautiful once we arrived the tower as you can see the beautiful city of Seoul
2582,4,The best option for panoramic views is the Lottle Worlds sky view but this is cheaper and closer to downtown
2583,5,A park where all kinds of people can go Go there upon opening and leave during closing time so that you will experience how it look like during the day and during the night Explore the beauty of the N Seoul Tower as well as the beauty of nature
2584,4,The tower was one of our stops on the Seoul City Tour Bus hop on hop off course You climb a slight hill from the base drop off point up to the tower itself Even without paying the expensive price to go all the way up the tower we had really stunning views for free just make sure you climb to the highest floor available before you cant go up anymore Going at sunset would be a great option as you then get to see the city views both during the light as well as after dark with the sparking city lights which is quite magical
2585,4,Seoul tower view are spectacular The tower was a wonderful stroll from our hotel and great for evening stroll Visited on Sunday evening and place was very busy and crowded Long wait to get the cable car and entrance to the observatory deck Once there the view was breathtaking I would definitely recommend
2586,4,I have visited this kind of towers many times I didnt expect too much But the tower stands the top of hill and the view is much more beautiful than the others
2587,5,We had a great time taking pictures at the heart lock area and just enjoying the cool weather it was about 14 degrees
2588,3,I suggest taking the hike up the mountain The sky cars we were packed like sardines We couldnt even move or see anything on the way up or down All I could think was this cant be safe So save your money and enjoy the sites The tower itself has lovely views but make sure its a clear day or you will be disappointed It is a rather large tourist attraction so dont be surprised by the amount of people and clutter It is a nice place to be stopping by and a pretty view to see but there are better sites in Seoul that are way more worth your time
2589,3,We had a hard time finding the best way to get there When we finally found the cable car to the tower we paid 8000 KW each and then had to pay another 10000KW to go to the top It was night time and the windows were smudged and the flash reflected off the window so very poor quality pictures Maybe it would have been better to go during the day
2590,4,Must in Seoul Fantastic viwes Go up befaure sunset and stay until dark You wont regret Low faire
2591,5,The N Seoul Tower area is a good place to take in the beautiful sites of the massive capital It has the tower itself but also platforms parks and nature that is nice to be in too
2592,4,The area gives a nice view of the city especially during the golden hour There are many restaurants and things you can do in this area The tower in itself is a landmark of Seoul but a lot of people come here to enjoy the panoramic view Its good spot for taking great photos as well
2593,4,I visited this place just right at the moment sun goes down The beautiful view from the park with the lovelocks a citylights of seoul the tower itself really memorable But this place need a scheduled buses to take the visitors from the bottom to the up above So it will so much helpful without waiting for too long
2594,5,There are 2 ways that I know of to get to the top 1 is to walk up which can be quite taxing if your not quite fit enough the other is to catch the cable car I have used both  The queue for the cable car can be quite long especially before sunset Allow plenty of time for this  Once at the top you will need to pay a fee for the tower itself There are many of locations around the top where you can take some great shots of the city but inside the tower itself is where you really see Seoul for its beauty  Buildings with a backdrop of mountains and cars which look like ants Lots of useful information pointing to different cities around the world  You really want to be up here when the sun is just about to go down The views and colours are amazing so a camera is a must  The food can be a bit expensive depending on where you eat but nothing overly expensive Shop around  This should be your number one place to visit
2595,5,Very nice view in a clear day or night We were there at the late after noon and night and it was pretty
2596,5,As the name Seoul towerit is a best place to go see the whole town from up there the view is always great from there even in the night
2597,5,Every time we come to Seoul we always end up coming to this place the walk to the tower is like a work out its beautiful when you get up there
2598,5,So much to see It is quite a bit of walking so be prepared There is a lot of food and sights to see there Enjoy Asp bring a lock to lock while youre there with your loved one
2599,5,Took the cart up to Namsan Tower to see the beautiful views of Seoul from up above This is a popular tourist attraction as you will see so many people there Theres also restaurants up there so you have a place to eat There are the locks of love that you will see all over the place Definitely make sure you bring a camera to capture all of its essence
2600,4,The first time I came to N Seoul Tower we walked up which was insane Second time we took the bus and cable car and it was during cherry blossom season which was so so beautiful Third time we walked and then took the cable car which was still a bit of a hike as we took the long way to get there but it was still worth it I would recommend going during cherry blossom season because the road is covered in the petals and its constantly raining down with petals from the trees especially when cars and buses come past  Youll see couples on dates most of the time so its a romantic place to take your partner and go for a nice stroll
2601,4,We took the Namsan Circular Shuttle Bus to the tower so that we could enjoy the view from Namsan It would be great if it was not foggy
2602,4,Namsan Seoul Tower is the BEST place to see Seoul in its entirety all at oncethen again youre 480m up in the sky so you have no choice but to see EVERYTHING ; The tower has a gift shop multiple restaurants and even a game room with individual karaoke rooms for 500 W per song  If youre planning to visit I highly recommend some decent walking shoes or even hiking shoes if you want to take the 1100m hike from street level near the National Theater to the base of the tower Its a HELLUVA hike but well worth ithowever make sure you check the weather I went on a bay air quality day and I felt it  If you can try to get during the fall to see the foliage OR go at night to see a brightly lit up Seoul
2603,5,Very beautiful On top is like being on top of the world I only had a short time there but it is all worth it Very lovely and romantic touring the Tower and around it
2604,5,Its refreshing to go a place where everyone seems to be in a great mood and you can enjoy a spectacular view I did not go inside of the tower but at the base there are a large amount of vendors including the Teddy Bear Museum Which is a teddy bear store They even have ice cream stuffed churros
2605,4,The walk up to the tower is up a hill through a forest which is a really lovely walk As you get higher you can see different views of the city and its gorgeous The tower itself is great to see the views the windows were really dirty but it wasnt so bad There are a few refreshments at the top and of course your usual souvenirs
2606,4,We walked from Myeongdong to Seoul Tower The walk is uphill Wear proper shoes Take a cable car up its interesting to see the view Too many locks there but glad we went there as the scenery is beautiful
2607,4,I visited here 2 years ago in the day and this year I had the opportunity to visit at night The view was amazing in the day but there is something about the darkened skies and the bright city lights that makes everything seems so grand  Purchase your tickets at the entrance There are other attractions here as well so you can decide what sort of tickets you want to purchase  There is a souvenir shop as well as restaurants and cafes You can purchase locks at the shop at the entrance level Of you are interested to do tile message you can only do so inside the tower itself  There are 3 ways for you to get here; one way is to ride a bus all the way up There are a couple of buses at Myeondong that you can take You can take a cable car; there was a shuttle bus that picked us up at the same Myeondong bus stop I mentioned just now If you are up for a walk and an adventure you may want to hike up Ive tried the first 2 options but I dont think I would want to hike up 
2608,5,The tower provide a stunning view of Seoul  But I personally think that it is unnecessary to enter the observation area You have to pay like KRW 8000 for the entrance And the view is pretty much the same with view you can get on lower level
2609,5,To visit this tower is must This is the only way how to realize the size of the city The lift is very quick And sky video in the cabin is amazing
2610,5,Tower on South mountain offers great view to the city Definitely must to see in Seoul do not miss it
2611,3,I went during the Golden Week holiday and it was horrible I waited one and a half hour to get in and the ONE HOUR in a line to get out using one of the only two elevators available can you say fire hazard The view was good but definitely not worth the wait
2612,3,We enjoyed the walk up to the base of the tower Once at the base we enjoyed the limited views due to pollution and felt that we wouldnt gain much by going up the tower The entrance fee is overpriced if the view is limited We got great views a few days earlier from a mountain in bukhansan park Walk up only took 20 mins
2613,4,The view is good However before you buy a ticket go to the socalled Heart lock observatory and check the view particularly the degree of smog The ticket is a bit pricey  10 000 KRW approximately 10 USD for an adult The customer service is bad  rude and almost no English The way to the tower is clearly signed It is sometimes steepy but doable You need about 30  60 minutes depending on your fitness Otherwise you can use a cable car
2614,4,Visited the tower as the sun was setting Well worth a visit and the cable car to the top is reasonably priced  though there is normally a queue of around 3060 minutes You can walk up to the top but this is a mildly strenuous option and involves lots of steps  Visit the tower at night to see Seoul lit up below  or at least what isnt covered by smog
2615,5,Its a very nice tower to visit Located on the top of Namsan thats why they called it Namsan tower Just take bus 5 or 3 from Cheungmuro you will be straight here You can see seoul city from the top of the mountain
2616,5,This tower beckons us to visit when we sight it from afar in and around Seoul And visit we did There is so much to see and do at this tower and its surrounds We took bus No 5 from Myeongdong Cars and taxis are no longer allowed past a certain point So the recourse is to go by bus or cable car Im glad we didnt take the cable car for the queue going back down was insanely long The bus brings you right up to the base of the tower This tower should be nicknamed Seouls or Namsans Love Lock Tower The variety of the shapes they form and the insane number of love locks stretch along different walkways are supported by zones  Heart Lock zone Shiny Love zone love seats etc And if you are lucky you might catch the filming of a love scene like we did
2617,5,The North tower offers you a great view of the city The ticket for the elevator to take you to the top is inexpensive and they have a coffee shop a souvenir shop at the top It is definitely worth the visit
2618,5,A nice place to have an aerial view of Seoul It has a nice Souvenir shop and a good restaurant The elevators roofs are fitted with LED screens that show you amazing space journey while being escalated The place has got worlds first LG OLED tunnel which is amazing too The place boasts of the highest wash rooms with clear glasses to have a view of city while relieving This is crazy but a nice idea Must use wash rooms here Happy travelling
2619,4,Nice introduction to Seoul view from the top of the N Tower We visited the place around 10am when there was less visitors Additionally we visited the historical fortress and the smoke signalling chimeys at the base of the tower We soend around 2 hours at this location before moving to Namdaemun Market We could visit Seoul Hanok Village from the N Tower as well
2620,5,This has been one my most favourite attractions in Seoul You can go there by cable car bus or you can hike up If you want take cable car I would suggest going around 10am since it gets really crowded afterwards Also I would suggest to take cable car for one way that is to reach the tower You can easily come down by the stairs while enjoying beautiful Seoul landscape  While going to the tower you can also visit Namsan park and Seoul tower complex Theres a lot of things to do there Gaming zone restaurants teddy bear gallery etc I particularly loved a perfume shop where I could make my own customized perfume The name of this shop is Aroma Aesthetics For me the ideal time to visit this place is in the evening although I had to wait an hour to get into cable car at this time But I guess its worth it
2621,3,If you have time you can head here to see the city from the top of tower It is crowded and other than the view not much more to do
2622,3,It was ok If you can drive up or walk up it might be better The line for the gondola is long Walking is hard all up hill
2623,4,Great views of the city Super packed though  Would recommend visiting via tour though  Our tour guide was able to drop us off all the way to the top Otherwise you can take the tram from the bottom or walk The line for the tram though was outrageously long
2624,5,Good thing we went here on weekday less crowded We rode the cable car getting there and the N tower lights are mesmerizing to view when u get there From the N tower we viewed the whole seoul citylights
2625,4,I walk up and took the cable car down I recommend this route it will allow for a nice walk in a park Not extraordinary but worth it The tower in itself is very much typical for these sort of attractions The first level 5F is very nice with a good view  some restaurants and shops and plenty of opportunities to take pictures You will need to pay 10000 KEW to go to the top It is recommended as there is a nice view A little expensive for teh offereing Worth going
2626,5,So the day that we went a family of 5 the two parents of fiveyearold and two teenagers we took a taxi up to the cable car I recommend that as the best way to get to the N Tower The cable car ride to the tower was jampacked full so its very hard to get your window to get good video so you might have to head your way strongly to get to the window to get some good video or pictures The wait to get on the cable car was not very long so that was very well worth it I think you can also walk up the hill and take all the steps to get to the in Tower which I would love to do on a nice spring or fall day not a rainy day like we went Make sure you take a lot of padlock or some kind of lock to add to the locks at the top I forget what theyre for but its really a pretty cool its a community or World Wide Arts peace youll understand when you get there but take a log or Google it before you get there to know why youre taking a lot There are several places to eat at the in Tower all ranges of prices ranging from probably 2 or 3 Bill signs 2425 Bill signs though so nothing really cheap but definitely a place to stop and eat if you want to have time it was crazy busy even on a rainy day Once youre up in the tower they have names major cities like New York City is so many kilometers away excetera excetera which is pretty cool so you couldnt go all the way around the whole circle and take pictures with you or yourself and your family and with the cities that youve been to or the city that youre from The little to shop up in the tower was wonderful and we thought the prices were very fair for some very unique gift ideas we opted for the little puzzle with the frame which happened to be on sale and they had multiple items on there like weekly or monthly cell so that was really The candy store if its still there was pretty cool also apart everything is impeccably clean and the candy is quite good although a little spendy but its worth it I would say if your only choice to go was during rainy weather then it absolutely still is a must go on but if you could go during clearweather then that would be the best although Im sure thats also the busiest
2627,4,The place is perfect for love birds as its full of signs of love   You have to walk a lot to reach to the main deck but once you reach on top the city view is very beautiful  One time visit place nothing much to explore 
2628,3,The cable car is 8000W to the Base of the tower however it is easy and free to walk up to the Base At the Base there are plenty of places to eat with lots of variety and a little shopping The views from here are also good If you want to go to the top of the tower it is 10000W Obviously the views are great from that height
2629,4,N Seoul Tower being the second highest point in South Korea is a good place to enjoy the panoramic view of the city especially at night where you can see the beautiful color of the city lights
2630,4,this had been recommended to us as a mustsee by a friend You can get to the tower by walking bus or cable car And then go up the tower to see Seoul laid out around you See all the locks hanging off fences and take photos in love seats We went up by cable car and walked down through the forest which made a pleasant afternoon
2631,5,We hiked up instead of riding the cable car enjoyed the lovely view along the way and saw the tower from afar
2632,4,you must go this spot if you want to see night view of Seoul amazing view you can get there with various ways
2633,4,We visited the N Seoul Tower at night the views were fantastic It was very romantic to see all the thousands of key rings on the fence
2634,4,We went there around 89pm the Q for the cable care only took almost 15min because cable care can occupy almost 3040 people when we reach the tower we have to climb the stair its exhausting im not sure if its any lifts available but the climb is worthedthe view ia breathtaking we can spend hours and hours just looking at the view and strolling along the Lock Love Tower food and drink vendor are also a available there really recommend
2635,4,This a popular tourist attraction and therefore prior planning is highly recommended It is advisable to go very early during the day if you want to head up to the N Seoul Tower as it can be very crowded We walked to the ticket office and the walk up isnt too bad Waiting time for a ticket is about 30 minutes Then another 3045 minutes to the cable car If you are super fit you can walk up to the N Seoul Tower otherwise the walk up is not for the faint hearted When we arrived at the ticket box there was an ambulance collecting someone that had collapsed from the walk Once you get up to the tower there is a lot to do shops eateries childrens activities marital arts demonstrations and much more We stayed here for about 3 hours and then walked down It was about 20 minutes walk down but you felt sorry for the people walking up as it is a long walk This is a must see when in Seoul
2636,5,One of our favorite places in Seoul Spectacular views We enjoyed seeing the old city wall and small signal towers Enjoyed seeing a traditional dance performance Thousands of locks attached to many of the fences by people locking their love We were dropped off by our little bus in the bus parking lot and walked up the hill Make sure you check out the window in the bathroom in the tower very surprised to see that
2637,3,Went during night time and it was packed with tourists and locals alike It was freezing when we got to the top of the entrance You get to experience 360 view of the city though nothing spectacular The queue to take the lift up the tower was long and once you are up there you need to hustle with a lot of people who are trying to view the scenery all at the same time Would also not recommend this if you cant take stairs as you still have to walk up a few flights of stairs to get to the entrance at the top even by taking the cable car up
2638,4,As youd expect for a tower over one of the biggest cities in the world Smooth organization and no time limit The windows were quite dirty everyone commented as the saw them it looked like the residue of dirty rain
2639,5,Recommend Its a great spot to watch the sunset and the big architectural balance ball is very cool for nerds like me  I loved it Plus downstairs is that famous dim sum spot I recommend you take a number before heading up because the wait is so long that way you should be up when you come back down Otherwise there is a huge food court with varied options
2640,4,We took a beautiful Uber car to and from the base of the tower one night It was a beautiful clear night so we had a wonderful view of Seoul There are a few cafes and souvenir shops It is worth visiting the toilets as the view out of floor to ceiling windows in each cubicle is magnificent
2641,4,When I went there were 2 options to walk up the hill or take the cable car We did both Walking up was a journey but a pretty one its definitely worth it Getting back down was a little wait because we thought there would be multiple cabins but turns out it was only one At the tower the view was amazing and theres a lock cage where you and your partner could buy a lock write your name and attach it to the fence Pretty cool
2642,4,Nice place to visit couples must have love lock Very enjoyable Cable car to N seoul tower is just short and contains almost 20 people A little bit scary hahahaa but its fun
2643,4,We walked to the tower it is 10 minutes walking but was really very challenging walk as it is in elevated street and there are stairs to reached the main entrance of the cable car There are long long queue for about an hour to ride the cable car It was crowded own and up as it is the weekend so avoid visiting during weekends The view is really excellent and there are lots to do there multi stories buildings with lot to do so you can spend hours there and the cherry blossoms trees was marvelous on the mountain give up gorgeous scenically picturistic view with grades of pink to white to green trees
2644,4,depending on the air quality Quite a hike if you walk cablecar available at a cost Food and drink options at the top Good for a halfday or less
2645,4,You see incredible views from so high up and its rather bizarre yet lovely to see such a view high up when you go the the toilets as well so you can still enjoy the view when you go and do what youve got to do  The food there is incredible and there are plenty of souvenirs for you to buy as well  It is only accessible by tour bus foot or cycling as the city attempts to reduce the emissions up the mountain
2646,4,It is about 1520 min uphill walk to the Namsan cable car station from Myeongdon station exit 3 Take the cable car to the base of N Seoul Tower  Nice views when walking to the base of N Seoul Tower from where the cable car stops  There are many photo spots with Love all over the base of the N Seoul tower a romantic attraction for couples I went there alone yet still enjoyed myself very much  Buy ticket to go up to the observatory deck of the N Seoul tower at the base The staff will guide you through You can buy ticket which includes dining or beer but i did not  I was there from evening til the sky turned dark Beautiful view Nice souvenirs at the observatory deck as well
2647,1,We arrived and my eyes almost popped out to see the queue We started queuing at 3pm plus and by the time we got up there it was 8pm plus We were hungry and i wasnt happy We ordered a noodle dish to share Didnt bother because the place was packed
2648,4,This is a nice place to go to see Seoul in a different perspective Many people choose to hike from the bottom to the top Below the tower there are plenty of places for lovers to take pics and even put locks in the lovers lock area like the one in Paris
2649,4,We enjoyed a free entry  as we are Seniors to The Tower  loved the clear views for miles on a sunny day Seoul is a large city of over 10000000 people  the city covers a huge area The view from up top of the Tower of the many Palaces is extraordinary  clearly displays there immense size Well worth a visit on a sunny day
2650,4,Really good views of Seoul from the tower There are also live performances in the square outside throughout the day There is a very steep road from the car park to reach the tower so this may not be suitable for those with limited mobilityfitness
2651,3,Go there in the morning to avoid queues If you do not mind waiting go just before sunset so you can see the city in daylight and nighttime Waiting times can be easily 60 minutes to the cable car and another 30 minutes for the tower lifts
2652,5,This tower is best to visit either at night or by day Though entrance up there costs a fortune the view of the entire city from its deck is breathtaking
2653,5,What a fantastic view over this great city And in addition they have made a most out of this place With the possibility to go up in the tower or take a picture with Psy close to the Love tunnel
2654,5,The best time of visiting Seoul Tower are in March AprilCherry blossom and Sept OctFall  We visited here every time when we come to Korea You can walk to the tower or take a cable car Good public transportation is available in the city  And you can check out Myung Dong the most famous shopping area and Namdaemoon Market the oldest market for whole sale rice in everything You can find good and delicious food with very cheap price in these area
2655,5,We took the stairs from the bottom walked the park to the top and was able to spend the evening and part of the night here Its so pretty with the lighted tower It was also very pretty with the sunset and I got great pics A must come kind of place
2656,5,Went here on a Saturday night and it was an amazing view The cable car was a bit crowded We ended the evening with dinner at the French restaurant and it was great
2657,5,We went there in the morning and decided to take the cable car for the experience Nice view at the top You can actually take a 15mins walk from Myeongdong station to the cable car station There is a love bridge where you can put a love lock The cafes are decent and have a great viewing area  Remember to bring your lock The price they are selling is expensive
2658,5,Great views of the city at night There is a lot of things to see right outside of the tower We even mailed our kids a letter from the top of the tower
2659,4,We went at this place almost evening When we rode the cable car going to the N tower i love seeing the whole city of SEOUL with all the city lights at its best view
2660,4,Accessible on foot or by shuttle bus it one of the mustsee places in Seoul The park around the tower is nice and the tower offers a beautiful view of Seoul
2661,5,We toured South Korea for 2 weeks and this was my 15 year olds all time favorite thing we did We did a lot so thats saying something The views are incredible its a smooth ride to the top and the show was done well Bring a lock so you can write your name and date on it and leave it with all of those thousands of other locks
2662,3,Cant really go to Seoul without experiencing this symbolic place Its a bit of a madhouse going up and down because of the queues for the lifts but the view is worth it
2663,3,Our family of 5 stopped here as part of the Seoul City Tour bus hop on hop off route We arrived about 3pm on a Sunday and was taken aback by the crowd We looked at the views and checked out the souvenir and other shops in the tower Didnt get a chance to go on the cable There was a long queue for that too Maybe we picked a wrong day to come I probably would have enjoyed it more if it wasnt so crowded
2664,4,Coming from Calgary where we have the Calgary Tower this tower seems small to me however the N Seoul tower is located in a cooler spot on a mountain rather than in the downtown city It was pouring rain today so I did not bother to go up and view as it was foggy and misty From what I saw around its ok but not a big deal for me
2665,4,We took a cable car up to N Seoul Tower and when we reach the top the view is amazing You could pay about 500 won to see a better view of Korea It was calming to see the streets and how small we actually are  The perfect place to snap some good photos to bring home
2666,3,It is a great view from the top even if it is a bit hard to get too Cable car was the option I chose to use Certainly a popular spot to visit
2667,5,Recommended to take the cable car to the top as it offers you a beautiful view of Seoul city The love lock terrace and the cutely shaped candy floss is a must go for couples before entering the tower Hello Kitty lovers can have a great time taking pictures with the lifesized Hello Kitty collect stamps and have memorabilia with the photo booth that imprints your picture on a card Up at the tower the aerial view of Seoul takes your breath away A must go for all tourists
2668,5,We like high towers from where you can view the city Taking the cable car up and down to nearby the tower was easy and the view from the tower was great We like the blooming gardens arount the tower
2669,5,An amazing hike up to the north Seoul Tower  Beautiful views and the gorgeous canopy of cherry blossom trees  Again worth the walk and the panoramic views of the city
2670,4,A fun time but very touristy and rather expensive for what you get The walk updown is great though and really worth doing Consider going up on the cable car and walking down
2671,4,Easily reached by bus from MyeongdongAt nightimetravel by bus allows you to see thhe beauty of Seoul as the bus goes up the trail
2672,5,This is the only place in Seoul that we appreciate You can have the best view of the city Perfect place Cozy ambiance Foods are also sold at the place We decided to walk down back to feel the nature Well maintained 
2673,3,We visited the tower since we want to see seoul from above And we did It was cold in the beginning of spring and theres not really much up there then the view Theres convenience store some restaurants popcorn candies and well the view Theres garden below or use the cable car to reach the top Pay some money again for the tower and on the top is kinda small Comparing with Tokyo skytree or Tokyo tower they seem to have more to offer Still we enjoy the view from above its just gorgeous during sunset and when the nigjt is coming lights from the city are too
2674,4,Best is take the tram up fast and fun Great view of Seoul there are parks and coffee ice cream at the top
2675,4,I had an absolutely fantastic time watching the sun go down from so high in the sky Watching the city light up was also incredible You really get a grand view of the bustling city and while you cant see it you can feel the citys energy Oh and its super romantic There are some restaurants and bars at the top so you can spend hours up there and there are many places to take photos
2676,5,This is another mustsee stop in central Seoul Arrive first thing in the morning to take the first cable car to the top to avoid crowds If you can walk back down the mountain Beautiful views of the city from the tower
2677,4,It is not the best when you have to stay in long line ane there is a space at the top up to max 200300 people Nice view but not the best
2678,4,My family  I went with a friend to N Seoul Tower at night  it is fantastic According to our friend the view is normally foggy because of the dessert sand that blows from China but with luck we werr able to get clear skies  a wonderful view of Seoul  Totally it was organized  well maintained The only hindrance we had was that we are not used to the weather because we live in a tropical country so for us 14 degrees is a bit cold  we had to wait in line outside for our gondola to take us down  we couldnt get shelter from the cold because we would loose our spot  Overall I would recommend this to any first time travels to South Korea
2679,5,I personally prefer this peak to HKs Peak as the view is better and the selection of restaurants and things to explore are more interesting It invites people to leave love locks on the railings and has a romantic atmosphere I went at night and they were many young couples families exploring the place The view was great as it oversees the citys lights  I took a bus up from Changdeokgong but walked down The walking isnt easy if you have bad knees as its steps all the way so if you are travelling with elderly please take a bus or cable car down instead of walking Walking is nice as you will walk along the old city walls and it brings me to Myeongdong directly so I ended the night with street food
2680,5,Second trip to Namsan First took the cable car and loved it Second climbed the mountain Dont recommend it if you have trouble breathing Because the breathtaking views will take anything else you need to make it to the top Fun things to do as shown by a couple of my pics Italian restaurant was delicious and I felt the price was reasonable considering the atmosphere and relaxing view
2681,2,We didnt go up as it was very expensive and there was a set of stairs up a hill pretty much next to the tower which offered a very similar view for free I would also say it is not the worth the trip to see just the tower there are a few parks and recreational rooms karoake pc rooms bars etc  nearby to make going to this part of Seoul worth it
2682,1,We took the cable car to reach the Tower We took beautiful pictures and watched the sun to fade There were a lot of lovers or tourists chose to walk up or down the hill in order to see the beautiful view alongside
2683,4,We went up on hazy morning in March and it cleared to see a great view of Seoul Its a bit cheesy with touristy things But its worth a visit Take the cable car up and walk down close to the Seoul wall
2684,3,If you want to see Seoul  this is a great place to go in order to get an overview  The price is ok and the trip up is efficient  If in Seoul  a must see
2685,4,Symbol of Seoul Must see I went for the sunset and thats worth it Beautiful view even if you dont go up the tower
2686,5,After a long walkclimb we reached this cale car center is a very nice and chilling place in Seoul
2687,5,Stunning 360 view of Seoul at night Good public transport connections or the use of a cable car You can take s walk through the gardens Plenty of gastronomic choices with a restaurant at the top of the tower affording outofthisworld views; pricey but worth every penny
2688,4,N Seoul Tower can be accessed by two ways by walking or taking the Namsan Cable Car Besides providing excellent views of Seoul and beyond there are also opportunities to try on the traditional Hanbok for some candid shots Free of charge as well as for couples who wish to declare their eternal love by leaving locks in specially designated areas Overall definitely well worth a visit  at least for half a day
2689,4,The N Seoul Tower is a great place to visit when in Seoul You get a wonderful 360 degree view of the city and its quite beautiful You can buy many souvenirs and you can even eat at the restaurant near the top The price is reasonable though not cheap Overall IId recommend this to anybody visiting Seoul for sure
2690,5,If You want go to N Seoul Tower better around afternoon like 500 PM or 600 PM South Korea Time and you must go to the observatory because night view from observatory is beautiful view
2691,4,After a nice and long hike you arrive in this kind of park with this quite big tower The view is magnificent and we took amazing pictures with our friends It was quite a sunny day so we were also very lucky
2692,3,Very personal opinion  After getting off the train we were told we could walk to the cable car and so we did At 15C we walked uphill and when arrived at the cable cars ticket I was sweating and took off my jacket  it was quite an uphill walk But of course you have the option to take the cab and on other side theres an elevator from down the road going to cable car tickets  The cable car ride has nice views esp during the time of our visit  winter and snowing I think thats my favorite part  Theres another charge to go to the observatory deck which we chose not to because you can already enjoy the view after the cable car  I rate it average because its just like a mall or some kind of commercial area at the top of the mountain Its not like youre going ski down That hike we did was not compensated with what I saw Again just personal opinion  I also dont think this is a good place to visit when you have even a bit of walking issues  Average because its not a place Id return to even without that uphill walk
2693,4,This is a pretty cool place to go to We took the tram up to the top of this hill It had about a 45 min wait and it was a 10 min ride Then walked around and found a place to put a lock on the fence with the tens of thousand other people Then took the elevator to the observation tower It was a little overcast but they mark the major cities and the distance This was pretty cool When we were done we walked down the hill It was a really nice afternoon
2694,5,Beautiful scenery  Its nice place to visit You can see city view from the top Its must go places of Seoul
2695,3,Not real crazy about this place Food was great a bit pricy but to many people and long lines to get down
2696,4,The place was nice My kids enjoyed walking around the venue and the love locks are also cute for couples
2697,4,We were there last weekend nice sunny day and they had a festival on long queue for the cable car around 40 minutes Each cable car that arrives are packed to the max Once at the top there are a few family friendly attractions near the base of the tower A few restaurants around if youre hungry Also theres actually a lift to go up to the cable car station from the other side near a tollway rather than climbing the hill from train station we only found it when going down Worth visiting maybe better on a weekday when theres less people
2698,5,to get to the top you have to climb about 400 metres for me its a bit tiring in the beginningclimbing while you deal with very cold weather but the ambience is sooo beautiful the snow that fall everywhere on the groundon the trees on the bench and the scenerymade this area one of the best place in Seoul  when I reached the topIm speechless its stunning  you can see the whole city  you can climb to love lock wall by a stair but the price of the lock is soo expensive so just enjoy the viewand have a cup of coffee and snack around  A MUST VISIT RECOMMENDED
2699,4,Skyline beautiful of the city Recomendable We go half a day and we take the cable car Very nice trip to do in the city
2700,5,this is an excellent place to visit the food in the restuarant is very good and has a large range it suit all palates The view is stunning and it is a must doo when visiting Seoul
2701,1,Stupid cable car cannot handle the volume of visitors 40 Tourists packed into the cable car no chance to take photographs or enjoy the scenery Not children friendly at all Coming down was the same 40 packed into the cable car after queuing for 30 mins coming down was a relieve
2702,5,Its nice place to visit You can see city view from the top Its must go places of Seoul Near itaewon tourist area
2703,4,This is a place with a lot of potential It is a good place with beautiful views restaurants and a piece of Seoul vibrant
2704,4,If youre near go there If theres been no rain for some time skip ityou wont see very much Go a day or so after a good rain and youll be able to really see Seoul And plan on dining there too
2705,3,We visited N Seoul Tower on a slightly foggy day and the view wasnt all that aweinspiring to be honest It was pretty romantic to watch the sun go down and see the city light up though  We had to take a subway then a taxi and then a cable car to take us to the tower Overall it cost the two of us around 27000W only to find out that we would have to pay another 10000W EACH just to go up the bloody thing Unnecessary extra cost in our opinion as the view from its base was pleasant enough especially from the cable car Generally a nice thing to do in the evening but dont expect to be blown away
2706,5,A must in South Korea the N Seoul Tower is a must especially at sunset You must take the Cable car up to the tower to admire the views going up and of course the views going down Beautiful shops there Fantastic pizza place Hello Kitty fans will enjoy the hello Kitty shop They have everyone covered The views are truly spectacular
2707,3,Similar to other towers in Korea I think they must all be run by the same company Nice views but overall not much else You walk around look out and then go back down
2708,4,Great view Couples can buy a lock and express their love by writing some nice words on it then lock it at the bridge You can visit the tower but nothing special A few resturant there if you want to take a break Cable car serve both way and cost 6000 won for single trip and 8500 for two way
2709,4,If youre up for a hike this is one of the places that you can visit However if youre not in shape you can opt to ride the cable car up to the tower where youll be rewarded with a stunning city view cold wind and colorful light display The place can be packed with people so choose your time and date wisely
2710,5,A great view and also very romantic They sell little writeable padlocks where you write the name of your wife and yours You then lock the padlock to a specially designated location to symbolize everlasting love It is very popular with couples My wife and I added our padlock
2711,4,If you are in Seoul try to visit the Seoul Tower for a breathtaking view of this vibrant city Located at the outskirts this place is little difficult to get in but provides a grand view overlooking this bustling city
2712,5,I liked thia place It was a great place to relax and take pictures The place was so clean and so refreshing There are other thing to do and look at on top aside form taking pictures The addition of the Love Lock Zones gives couples an extra reason to visit this place
2713,4,It is a must visit View Seoul from the Tower Do not forget to pledge your love and loyalty to your love one by purchasing the lock and seal it at the Seoul tower You may come back a few years later and noticehey my lock is still there Great view and it is also romantic place to be
2714,4,Views from the tower are good I visited in the late evening where its almost dark with city lightings can be seen I would recommend to go around 5 PM depending on the season when there is sunlight and stay until dark to enjoy both views During spring I heard this mountain one which tower is located is full of flowers like cherry blossoms however I visited in feb and its bone chilling cold Also there is a locks areas once you come down from the tower quiet similar to the one in Paris Views from this locks area is great
2715,5,I went there with my kids around December 2016 We took the bus there and it was quite tedious to walk up the slope during cold weather We had a cup of coffee to warm ourselves up before going to the top point of the tower There are several shops and restaurants there but unfortunately one of the store owners located on the first floor selling accessories and souvenirs was not friendly Nevertheless we didnt let this affect our mood The scenery at the top is so beautiful It was nice and we bought quite a few souvenirs from the store there We also visited the Hello Kitty Island located on the first floor which is so adorable We all love Hello Kitty  Friends We spent about an hour there taking pictures My kids enjoy it so much and have been sharing with their daddy who missed it since then lolhe is so jealous about it We will be going there again and with daddy this time of course
2716,5,Seoul has more romantic attractions seemingly built for couples than any other city Ive visited Namsan tower has great viewseither at night or during the day You can even walk up the hill like we did and its not a bad hike
2717,5,Nice view at nite n its super cold Quite tiring to walk up e hill with the kids but its a great experience Kids enjoy e place n will come again but by cable car to go up
2718,5,Visited here on the Seoul City Bus Tour Very fun to go to the top and look out over the city Definitely a tourist trap but worth the money
2719,5,The time I went there is mid March the weather is approx from 0 to 10 temperature go lower after late noon We take the cable car accross and see the Tower in night time We didnt go to the top point However we can see the beautiful scenery from the cable car along the way and reaching point can also see the beautiful Seol scenery kids game arcade and 3d large screen also available
2720,4,Nothing fancy but the locks that were displayed to show love was an amazing sight to see The tower showed the view of Korea and i am not a big fan it Same like burj khalifa
2721,5,Enjoyed the trail up View is fantastic the feel is so romantic Dreamlike view 4pm I bet this place looks better at night w all the lights Will definitely be back  visit this night time 
2722,4,Get a great view of the city to see how big Seoul really is We went at night very cool with all the city lights  The cable car ride to the tower is nice but if you take the back roads to the cable car you better be in shape cause the hills are very steep  Not sure about having dinner up there didnt hear anything or anyone talking about it
2723,4,Although I never ventured into the tower it stands out in the city with such grace and elegance especially at night time and a great opportunity for photographs Standing below gives you the perspective of how tall the building it is I would imagine on a clear day the views would be spectacular
2724,3,The tour was hyped as being fun and interactive but it was morep Li he than anything else The sheer magnitude of steps made this challenging
2725,3,The tower is easily accessible If you dont like to walk the cabs and buses can drop you in frunt of cable car Otherwise there is a scenic walking path The scenic beauty is due to cherry blossom trees planted all around the tower I visited in March Cherry blossom bloom around april Unfortunately there was not much to see If you are visiting in winters  Give the place a miss View is worth it during spring
2726,4,This is THE landmark in Seoul You can get there by bus or better still and if you are up for it then I would recommend walking If you find yourself there during the day it is a great walk uphill though through the park relaxing and peaceful If you get there in the evening then for sure you will find the best spot for some good photos The tower has different beautiful lights and on a clear daynight you will enjoy the view of the city from there
2727,5,You may talk a cable car on your way up and down from Namsan Tower I suggest going there late afternoonearly evening Take the cable car on your way up and walk the trail on your way down to be amazed of the view that you are about to see Really worth it
2728,5,good place to see view of seoul city i went there at night so i can see full of light from there you should go there if come to seoul
2729,4,We can reach this place by using tramcable car or by bus then walking to the top of area Good scenic here and many trees at the garden We can see the whole of Seoul city from here
2730,3,The city view is just so so Not really necessary to go up to the top of the tower But good to take a walk to the tower Theres other view point you can take a photo of the city instead of going up
2731,4,Its typical tower Go there at night to see amazing panoramic view of Seoul Its also accessible by bus and cable car but best way is by walking from Namsan Park for about 20 minutes The place has this Love lock like in france So cute
2732,5,Amazing view from the TOP of Seoul tower have restaurant arcades photos taking in hanbok and during the winter season visit is nice and wonderful Can take a lot of nice pictures;
2733,5,I wish i could have seen the place during an evening tour because the view from up there is spectacular Unfortunately my visit was not for leisure and was for work There are love locks everywhere so be sure to purchase a lock set and place a mark there There is also a beautiful scenic buscar ride down  Definitely a must do while in Seoul 
2734,5,Go there in the night at God weather and you will have a beautiful view of Seoul A must visit of you are around
2735,4,Instead of taking the cable car I went there by climbing the stairsit was a bad choice BUT Im not regretting my choice because it was a spectacular view and experiences I mean I know you can get the same view if youre using the cable car but it is all up to youbut for me it was really close to nature and you can see the eldest holding hands like a real relationship goalduhsince my guesthouse just around the corner so its really handy When I was there I went for 3 packages which includes the Hello Kitty Island a too much pinkish place for people who are hate pink Ssen Toy Museum yassss Marvel fan Star Wars alert and Observation deckSurprisingly at the Hello Kitty Island was a fun place to enjoywhile the Ssen Toy Museum a place that so amazingimagine the life size of iron manokay i need to stopso the last stop will be the observation deck was well yeahif you used to go any obdeck so just the same when i went down the surrounding for this tower as you already knew the lockish for couple things but also good for taking pictures
2736,5,Such a cool place to see the entire city Loved the lock of love We rode the bus up and walked all over Its a must see in Seoul
2737,5,We went there at night You can either purchase a ticket for the cable or just walk up to the tower The waiting line wasnt that long Bring your own lock or purchase one at the store if you are planning to put love lock there
2738,5,Went to the top on the hop on hop off bus tower worth the ticket price 12000Kwon on its own Clear day Highly recommended Suggest do early in your trip to help get your bearings
2739,4,Seoul Tower is a must see in Seoul There are great views and lots of different things to do while visiting the sight Lots of couples visit and place there love locks around the area as well
2740,5,You need to negotiate a steep climb of about 100 meters from the last point where you disembark from your buscar to be greeted with this mammoth structure built in 1969 for telecommunication purpose A superfast elevator will take you up the observatory from where you can enjoy stunning beauty of Seoul city at night
2741,5,We took the cable car up and the view from the cable car was beautiful Needless to say the view from Seoul Tower was beyond words They even have a loo with a view 
2742,3,Went up and unfortunately the glass panes were all dirty and could hardly enjoy the view unless it is seen at night which is unfortunate
2743,4,Everyone at one point must see the N Seoul Tower Its one of those places that you just need to see  Its great for views Go on a clear day  Its a lot of walking so be prepared Its also a steep climb either with or without steps Depends upon which side you walk  This is definitely one of those places that you need to see
2744,4,Easy access to the tower Cable car and elevator You can take great pictures on a clear day Nice view and souvenir shop
2745,5,The Admission 10000 won for the observatory entry If you are not going up to the observatory there is no fee to check out the surrounding area There is cafe shop and the famous love locket walls  The Tower Standing at 2367 meters tall this is Namsans main tourist attraction spot You can enjoy a complete view of Seoul Enjoy the laser show and beautiful nightscape of Seoul from the observatory on the second and third floors or in the revolving restaurant  The Location Board Namsam Circular Bus 2 3 or 5 or Namsam Cable Car
2746,4,There are two common ways to go up to N Seoul Tower 1 By cable car The queue is long but it is moving quite fast The only gripe is that you are being packed like sardines in the cable car and I didnt quite enjoy that 2 By bus Cheaper option as well The bus is not crowded like the cable car But the uphill hike of 5 mins is quite strenuous  Overall it is a great place to visit if you havent been up But otherwise nothing too special
2747,5,You can take a buss or car or hike or ride a bike to it The tower is just a tower durring the day but is nicely lid durring the eveing But the view of the city from the platforms at the bottom of the tower and at the top of the tower is very nice We arrived early and it was quite crowded at the botom platforms When we came down from top of the tower it was very crowded There are cofefee shop and a restaurant at the top so you can recharge and have a nice view before you continue to explore Seoul
2748,4,Very nice outside activity for a sunny day To go there just head to Myeongdong subway station get exit 3 and grab bus number 5 at the bus stop outside this exit The bus takes you to the top of the Nansam hill its an excellent alternative if your are not in the mood for hiking At the summit there is a great infrastructure for tourists restaurants toilets etc
2749,5,A MUST Place to Visit perfect for both day and night view If you are a couple night is the best time to visit N Seoul Tower and during day time it is advisable to be at the place around 10am at least due to group tours
2750,5,When I went there it was snowing and I got so excited to take the pictures there and of course enjoy an amazing seoul from there
2751,4,This is the city landmark where all the tourist and all couples in Korea go Went there on early March at night with super cold weather but still it was very crowded You can reach to tower area by hiking or cable car The view is amazing at night and there are many cafes and shops around the area
2752,5,Located about 15 minutes from the subway you can ride a cable car to the top absolutely not recommended for those who are claustrophobic or you can take a bus to the top You can even walk to the top if you want but its a rather steep climb At the top you can purchase a lock to lock on the fences around the tower Theres plenty of shopping and food at the top but I recommend eating elsewhere as it is cheaper Some areas are crowded but it was easy for us to find a quieter area
2753,5,Ive been to KL Tower before and its just the same as N Seoul I guess its the typical tower experience However the love locks area besides the N tower was so beautiful
2754,5,They have love locks here  If you are planning to go here you can ride a bus and also walk from Myeongdong station We did the walking It was a 10 min uphill walk If you also love walking the Try the walking youll see guesthouses on way up But if you easily lose breath go with the bus Getting there was easy so if you are planning to do the Cable car it is around 15000krw for a 2way trip There is a fee of more or less 10000krw in entering the observatory tower and they have a package that comes with popcorn and drink You can also purchase a bundle ticket where in youll be able to enter the other museums there but it will be a lot more pricey I suggest that if youre planning to go at top go there before sunset You can stay up until the sun sets At night it has a different scenic view as you can see the night lights but youll have a hard time taking pictures because of the light inside the observatory it reflects on the glass windows
2755,3,As a local tower itself I think is not that attractive You can find a few nice mountain trails near the tower The short  walk mountain trails can take you to Grand Hyatt hotel Shilla hotel and down town Seoul From the most of short mountain trails you can meet nice picture of Seoul skylines of East West South and North Get the fresh air in the mountain trails especially during Spring and Autumn times In the early morning you can view nice sunrise from the top of mountain trails not hard to reach the top
2756,4,great place to lounge around and see seoul from above a tower  there is a great place for kids to play and a 4g screen open to anyone  lots of tourists
2757,4,This is the best place for a 360 degree view of Seoul It really helps appreciate the size of this city The available facilities are good enabling visitors to decide the pace If you enjoy uphill walks and have the time then walk up the path from the park below If you are short on time then opt for the cable car to the tower You will need tickets for everything same as such towers elsewhere in the world
2758,5,You dont have to spend any money unless you want to here which is nice We walked up from the millennium Hilton and it was about 15 milesbut a ton o stairs obviously Some great shops and some amazing views at the top There must be over a billion locks at the top secured to various places with writing on them for love The cool this is you can buy a lock up there for about 8 and they give you a marker to write on it as you like
2759,4,Yeah its the highest point in Seoul making it one of the best destination you must go to as a traveller This is a must see place if you just want to unwind and take a look at the vast sea of city lights sparkling in front of you Couples friends and visitors make time to visit the Love Locks to lock the infinite chance to fall in love with this loving place
2760,5,One of the most beautiful places Ive ever seen Be sure to go up the cable car in the daytime At night you can take a trolley to the top Just wonderful Dont miss it
2761,4,it was 10 minutes walk from our hotel in myeongdong going to cable car station we both two way ticket for the cable car the two way ticket price has discount i think the One way ticket is 6000 won while the 2 way back  forth ticket is 8500 won which is cheaper If it was not that chilly cold we could have just bought the one way ticket and walk down the hill and enjoy the amazing view  On our way via cable car you see the amazing view of the city we waited until evening even it was bone chilling to see the light of the N Seoul Tower  We explored the ground of the tower Separate entrance fee for the hello kitty but since were not fan of hello kitty and we did not want to pay additional entrance fee we didnt bother going inside and also a separate entrance fee to go up the observatory  There was a traditional culture show dance number when we arrived Guests were invited to try the spear throwing activity i was lucky to be one of the selected guests even though i was not able to hit the bamboo in front with the heavy and long spear they gave me I think I need more practice I will sure hit it next time haha   There were restaurants and cafes around the tower There is also a souvenir shop inside There were shops that sell different colors of lovelocks but we brought our own locks we hope to find it when we come back  We hope to be back on spring time or on cherry blossom
2762,4,walk up its a short hike and you should not turn around and enjoy the view before youre at the top theres a free bus going down if I remember correctly This is a mustdo in Seoul
2763,3,Need more fitness to walking from guesthouse to this tower to see all the nature n surround of this area Euljiromyeongdong namsan seoul tower
2764,4,I cant say that its a great place but not bad On top you can see the whole city But please be prepared to walk a lot and stand in a long queue In Seoul few people speak English and it was very strained But overall it was exciting I am not sure if I will come back again
2765,5,Definite visit on the 1st day so you can get your bearings and see the city in a Birdseye view Also nice walk either up or my preference down the hill with blossoms everywhere
2766,5,the n seoul tower is landmark of seoul located on the top of the hill you can go there either by cable car or bus it is romantic place for couple
2767,3,We went up on a nice sunny day but wi dows too dirty to get any good photos Outside shots at base of tower were good though
2768,5,Really recommending visiting Seoul Tower a beautiful view from the top of the tower and around outside A cool experience
2769,5,The North Tower at Seoul was an interesting and fun place to visit It was within walking distance from our hotel and took us about 25mins on foot The cable car was fun to ride which took us to and fro up the hill although you can hike it up or down We purchsed love locks from up there and is hoping to visit it again in the near future to locate our locks One can purchase locks from elsewhere which I suppose would be cheaper rather than buying it from up there Certainly one of the best places to visit when in Seoul Cheers
2770,3,You can either get up to the tower by walking or by taking a cable car We were going to walk but couldnt find the right path so we took the cable car instead Even though the cable car service was quite organized there was a long line and we had to wait for about half an hour before we could go up The way up was nice and I got a lot of cool videos and pictures  We didnt have time to explore the ground floor of the tower I did see a hello kitty store tho but Im pretty sure there were a couple of restaurants or cafes down there We quickly discovered that you also had to pay to actually go up in the tower which was annoying since we had already payed for the cable car but it didnt cost that much We also had to wait in line to get to the elevator maybe 15 minutes or so The view is very pretty once you actually get up You can see the whole city Everybody was taking pictures but the windows till didnt get too crowded There was a candy store and a souvenir shop on the inner side I didnt buy anything but there was a wide range of different goods Overall the trip was fun Ive been to Burj Khalifa so it wasnt that mindblowing for me but you got a cool view  We decided to walk down but you can obviously also take the cable car I think our experience would have been much nicer in the summer when its warm and the plants are green I do recommend coming to the tower but maybe not in the winter  visited with my dad
2771,5,Didnt go all the way to the top as was too late for it But pretty sure that I wouldnt spend that much with 4 of us just to go a bit more to the top Walk and views are great from that point already
2772,4,Went here with my wife before we got married It was a very nice place to walk around and enjoyed the experience a lot Remember going up by cable car and it provided a very nice view Couples would usually sign a lock with a message and lock it on the fence Totally surprise seeing all the locks on the fences
2773,4,The tower was part of a tour package we purchased The have a fence at the bottom with locks of love where they gave thousands of locks from couples photo attached The view from the tower is great next time I will go at night
2774,5,Very romantic restaurant You might think it gets old to go to the same expensive restaurant for special occasions but it doesnt That panoramic view will keep you coming back time and time again just like it has for my wife and I
2775,1,Go during the day Night views arent so great and the windows are very dirty which inhibit good photos from being taken Be prepared to waitand waitand wait40 minutes to go inside 30 minutes to get to elevator to go up and 30 minutes to come back down Too many people and very unorganized compared to all the other world towers weve been to Such a shame 
2776,4,Being regular visitors to Seoul we figured we should go and see N Seoul Tower eventually and were not disappointed The tower features beautiful views of the city and is a great starting point for a walk in Namsan Park Having said that it would not make it onto my bucket list for a first visit
2777,3,The views are impressive but it is kind of tacky Perhaps if you dont take the cable car and instead walk the trails it would be more rewarding
2778,5,Nice place to hangout with friends is fun  with girlfriend is even more awesome must go place
2779,5,Nice view from the top around a lot of shops and nice restaurants Perfect to visit this place in the sunny day
2780,4,This is the highest place in Seoul whose top observatory is really proper to see around the Mega city You can also enjoy lunch in the tower
2781,5,Namsan Tower is MUST visit place if you visit seoul for sightseeing I really recommend climb to the top of the hill by walk It take about one  one and half hour depends on the course Several courses are well arranged and very ecological  Recommend to start to walk around sunset time and enjoy night sightseeing at the tower When you go down if you think you lost the right path do not worry Just go down any way you will meet any road you can take taxi or bus Just relax and enjoy Total estimate hours for this hiking will be four to five hours
2782,5,Famous romantic place in Seoul Im glad that I took shuttle bus instead of cable car to reach mountain top of N Seoul Tower The shuttle bus drove along the Namsan Park and the cherry blossoms is amazing deeply amazed by the cherry blossom rain as the wind blows The scene on top of N Seoul Tower was great Recommend to go during evening so that you can see both Day and Night Seoul Citys scenery Definitely worth the visit
2783,3,We went there on a very clear night The night lights of Seoul is average and the sight from the tower is nothing spectacular The only interesting thing is the cable car which takes you to the tower But expect long queues Youd get bored on the tower after 30min
2784,4,You can go there by cable car Good place to visit you can find a lot restaurants to eat something should to visit if you go to seoul
2785,3,The trip was nice Honestly I feel like Daegu Tower is a lot nicer and theres more to see but if youre in Seoul definitely stop by and get a picture at the needle There was a good hamburger place inside that was super packed but other than that I spent about an hour touring the needle when in Daegu I usually spend about 2 hours or so
2786,4,Just like what other reviews have mentioned its the best to go when the sun is going to set and slowly go towards night The view is the best
2787,5,I walked from the Grand Hyatt up to the Seoul Tower Great trails and some amazing views of the city I would recommend this for walking or jogging and just a nice place to catch some beautiful views
2788,5,Namsan Tower is a landmark of Seoul It is one of the tallest tower in the world and it has an elevator which takes you from the ground floor to the Observatory desk 236 meters high in 25 seconds Very very quickly From the top you can see all parts of Seoul The view from there is wonderful
2789,4,Seoul tower was among must visit place in our list during our south Korea visit On reaching the top after going through a lot of queues we realized it has to be a must visit in Seoul A complete 360 degree view of the city along with good options to dine and drink on the top Do not forget to get your picture clicked with your city name on the glass around the wall You can also experience the best undisturbed view from the washrooms Try to reach before evening so that you can get beautiful sunset view as well Would surely recommend this place while your visit to Seoul
2790,4,Not for the disabled Getting to the tram station can be quite the hike uphill Once you pay for your ticket you queue up It can take some time to get on the tram 30 minutes for us on a cold Friday night When you get to the top of the tram more stairs to the Tower I have to admit though the view is beautiful from here
2791,5,Before you head up to the tower look around on the horizon if you can see that it is clear then a good day to head up If it is hazy then leave the tower for another day You can either walk up free take one of the 3 bus routes that go to the top w1250 take the cable car w8500 or a Taxi The tower is open from 10am until well after sunset so great views of the city day and night There are good views on either side without going up the tower but for only w10000 go to the top and have a look all the way round
2792,5,It was super cold that time when we visit  The view was amazing  Got a chance to make a souvenir wood photo of my family  Thank you  Great destination
2793,5,This is the best place to get an amazing view of the city It is well worth the walk and the cable car ride We were here twice as we decided to view it again in the dark and it was incredible I would recommend the night option
2794,5,This place is not only for lovers and couples but also for families Other than the tower they also have other attraction like hello kitty island No halal food option for muslim  The tower itself is great Great view of Seoul Will surely come again when we are in Seoul
2795,5,I love this place and I would like to live in Seul for to be a regular customer in this place  I  Korea 
2796,4,Very beautiful place recommended to visit at night Many tourist in there and many food if u hungry u can eat therewe use cable car to reach there
2797,5, my family really enjoyed this place although its really cold when we got there last dec 221016 but its all worth it we just cant help ourselves to take pictures such a lovely place
2798,5,Recommended to visit at night for better view Need really good stamina to climb at namsan tower because no transport allowed at namsan tower area
2799,5,Half the people here are tourists The crowd of people is quite large Otherwise it nice to visit either during day time or night time
2800,5,Good place to see seoul you can see mega city seoul in a view under the tower are locks to remember lovers love
2801,4,This tower offers a nice view on the whole city but well; there isnt much to see To be honest the city doesnt look exceptional from the observation floor A bit disappointed But the night view is nice Small tip if you bought the tmoney card for transportation in Seoul you have a small 10 coupon to the price of your entrence ticket in the small box 
2802,5,View from the Tower is awesome Better to go on a clear day to get the most of the view Activities around the tower are great very technology orient also fun for the kids
2803,5,As the N Seoul Tower is very central in Seoul it enables you to see the entire city from a 360 degree view If you are in Seoul for the first time try the cable car that takes you to the top without having to do the big hike from the bus stop
2804,5,This was an amazing place to visit well worth braving the 12C temperatures With breathtaking views of Seoul and a great restaurant I would recommend anyone to go We went at night and the lights across the city were spectacular
2805,5,worth taking the Namsam cable car up to the tower inside there are plenty of resturants and shops even if you dont intend to go up the tower
2806,5,Sensational view from the top We were using the hop on hop off Seoul city bus and bought our ticket with our bus ticket and saved 1000KRW per person Not much up there but its a great view Just shows you how huge Seoul really is  Theres places to eat but they arent cheap Recommend going there after lunch and having a beer at the twosome cafe at the top Its the level down where you catch the lift back to ground  Theres a cable car that takes you up there which we didnt utilize but wished we had Dont know much about it but look into it Namsam cable car
2807,4,We enjoyed the view of seoul city during our winter trip u have to climb a lil bit to get to observatory area  Dont forget to sip a chocolate drink as it is a must and eat fries as they are very delicious   Went there by subway and 
2808,4,i visited this tower in the morning so the air was very fresh and slightly colder because its located up near the mountainyou can get a view of the city from the tower but unfortunately it was kind of foggy that day Actually there wasnt much to see but im still loving the view and the air i think its a nice place for a stroll 
2809,2,The view from the tower was just mediocre We went there and a lot of kids hung out there It was mostly just gift shops and cafes It is not worth your time to visit this landmark
2810,4,Visited on a weekend If you want to travel wisely you can reach the tower via bus Its cheaper and less hassle no long lines Great place but no need to go up the deck
2811,4,Dont leave Seoul without at least visiting it once The view from the top is 360 degrees and worth the 8500 won cable car fare To get to the cable car station we walked from Myeongdong station exit 3 but it was a steep climb for around 25 minutes Best to take the lift along Sogongro its the major intersection between Hoehyeon and Myeongdong stations Bus no 3 or 5 also go up there but we opted to take the lift down then walk to Myeongdong shopping district which takes around 20 minutes from the base of the cable car station
2812,4,This tower is very pretty at night If like to watch the city from the top this experience is for you Before you go just make sure to find out the closing time Taxis are scarce at this time as well so plan ahead for public transport It is worth a visit at least once when you are in Seoul
2813,4,We went during quite cold weather so it was a bit difficult until we got up the viewing floor I was particularly disappointed that the windows werent very clear so I didnt get good photos Just on a side note if you go to the womens and probably mens toilet too there is a breath taking view inside the actual cubicles So thats an enjoyable moment to take in while you do your business
2814,4,I have been to better lookout spots in the world but still this is not too bad It is nice in the evening  Dont take the cable car ripoff Dont go up the tower itself it isnt worth it
2815,4,You may feel the love is in the air I just loved to be here see people full of smile during winter including me off course I wish to visit this place again with my families
2816,5,N Seoul Tower has amazing views of Seoul and the mountains You take a cable car up to the tower There are some cafes and souvenir shops there and it is heavily decorated for couple to take cute pictures They sell heart shaped love locks to hang in several dedicated places around the base of the tower It is inexpensive and worth the trip for the views and photoops
2817,5,My daughter and I visited the N Seoul Tower We took the cable car up and back You can walk but it was freezing cold The views are amazing There are also multiple places to eat The place is lined with padlocks You can buy them for about 8000 won or buy a cheap one and write a message and leave it somewhere
2818,4,if you want to see Seoul and its panoramic view then Seoul Tower should be included in your itinerary It is an easy hike and on the way up there are different places to stop and enjoy the view If you dont like to hike theres also the cable car that will take you to the tower But I am not recommending this The wait time is very long When you reached the base of the tower there are different restaurants and cafes and themed childrens museums
2819,5,while I dont remember the floor you can access for free ask take the elevator there and walk around Lots to see Its an interesting place We took a bus up there; would be a long walk otherwise
2820,4,Great view from top Also there are shops that selling a padlocks if you wanna write your couples name  souvenirs ice cream and so on
2821,5,it was beautiful with snow covered all over the trees and landscape we went up and down by the cable car which was quick the snow covered all over the area however we did not go further into the building due to limited time
2822,4,Great experience to climb up to the tower at night Breathtaking views of the city of Seoul from the top of the towers Very popular amongst the local and tourist from other countries all around the world
2823,5,Enjoyed seeing viwes of Seoul  Also of interst were all thelocks that were entertwined on the gates just like the bridges in Paris It was cold and possibly not the best time of year to visit but the grounds were still very attractive I would think even more so in spring time
2824,5,Its nice to go there during night time Can see good view of Seoul Also you can buy some souvenirs
2825,4,Snow started to fall when we reached the top the place was crowded and floor was slippery because of the snow and ice Took a lot of nice and memorable photos and enjoyed good coffee and burgers at the top
2826,4,Been to Namsan Tower twice The first time was during evening time and my friend and I took the bus to get to the place of which we continued by walking uphill to get to the main area which was quite an exercise haha The view was really beautiful during eveningnight time and I was so overwhelmed with everything that I had tears in my eyes yes that dramatic haha but of course do expect a bit more crowd during night time  Second time my friend and I went there during noon time on a weekend so we waited for as long as 2 hours to get to the cable car and everything Make sure you plan well and avoid the weekends as much as possible if youre planning to visit Namsan Tower However day time visit offers a different view and better overall experience so it really depends on what youre looking for  Had a great time on both visits and one thing is for sure lots of couples visit Namsan Tower for their dates so if youre single you might feel a little bit awkward haha P
2827,5,Certainly one of my favorites in Seoul Though it was a chilly winter night when we went here I enjoyed everything in N Seoul Tower from the long uphill walk from Myeongdong Subway Station to the Namsan Cable Car though it was a bit touristy and the cable car got really crowded pick the door side to capture better pictures The tower is situated on top of Mt Namsan hence the name so you can have a better view of the city which for me is best at night Couples should not miss this attraction and the chance to hang your love locks in the thousands of love locks in the tower railings Dont worry if you forgot your pens and padlocks these are available at the convenience store at the Namsan Cable Car station and at the N Seoul Tower Cafe and restaurant are also located in the area You may purchase one way or twoway ticket via cable car but I suggest getting the 2way on winter as it can really get freezing cold
2828,5,Seoul tower is a must see The tower itself not so exciting but its not just the tower You can take a cable car up watch the view and on top the garden and layout is very nice Few eateries and convenience stores and locks for couples to leave behind their memory Excellent place for couples
2829,4,Seoul Tower is a beautiful tower We took the cable car to the tower The walk to the cable car is very difficult as the road heading there is very steep Better to take a taxi to the cable car station When we reached the tower again there were lots of stairs to climb Only when we were coming back that we noticed the lift down to the cable car From the cable car station we took a taxi to the subway station
2830,5,At the base of the tower before you take the lift up you can see alot of locks and it is a really amazing At the top there is 2 levels of observatory and both offer great view of seoul There is a souvenir shop at the observatory which have some nice stuff to buy for memories The place is not huge so 12 hours should be enough If you go at nice the tower lights up and it is really beautiful too
2831,5,This place is great for all kinds of groups Families couples or friends You can also buy a lock to put into the heart and write a note to keep there Its not easy to get up there because theres quite a line to take the lift up Theres actually 2 sections First take the lift up to the base tower Second buy a ticket to go up to the top and get a view Depending on your interest my friends and I felt the base was already enough Theres a gift shop at the top and 360 window view
2832,4,Quite a small circumference of Seoul Tower but with great views of different mountain You can even purchase fb at level 1 before you head up to the highest floor Enjoy your popcorn with the good scenery
2833,5,on a clear day Bit of a bummer to get up there and have the view obstructed by fog or haze On a clear day though fantastic view of the city and all therein and the hills mountains surrounding the city
2834,4,we got there just before sunsetits nice  romantic placewe can put out love lock with our name on it at the wall providedvery crowded and long queue at the cable car station
2835,4,you can go hike to the tower or take cable car I took cable car going up the I walk down Its a nice place to visit Dont forget to put a lock there if you visit it with your love one
2836,4,Visited with husband and our 2 boys 12 and 9 We bought a round trip ticket for the cable car and climbed to the top get a taxi from your hotel to the cable car station; cheap and hassle free Once at the top base of N Tower there are various things to look at and a good selection of decent cafes for snacks and good coffee You then buy another ticket which allows you to go in the lift to the 360 degree observation deck Its all well done and you also get a novelty green screen photo taken extra cost The view on a cool blue skied day was amazing and well worth it Pay a visit to the toiletsyou get a floor to ceiling window to look out of while you do your business There are 3 restaurants to choose from quite expensive but we chose to go back down the tower and have a gourmet burger at N Burger Well worth a few hours but make sure you go on a clear day or night
2837,4,Awesome views from the tower short but expensive cable cart ride to the top but panoramic views of Seoul when you get there Must do attraction
2838,3,Namsan Tower is good to visit during spring and fall since you can see the cherry blossoms or colorful autumn leaves during those times If youre taking a cable car there its a good way to enjoy the view of Seoul from top surrounded with mountains and hills The only problem is this place is not too exciting for single Why Its actually okay for singles to go there but since this place ALWAYS packed with couples this might make singles grow uncomfortable with the surroundings  Good for leisure taking pictures and appreciating nature
2839,4,Great views if the day is clear There is a cost to get around if you want to take the sky lift up and to take the elevator up the tower Personally I thought the combined 18 was worth it
2840,4,Best feature of the tower is the markings on the glass describing where things are located in the North Cool thing to see
2841,4,We had a great time And we so lucky to see and play with the snow The cable car to seoul tower on time Will visit again and will recommend to all
2842,4,Great for families friends and couples Love locks can be found within the area I went during winter but still amazingly beautiful especially at sunset
2843,4,Came by the N Seoul Tower the other day and it offered great views of Seoul for 10k entrance fee There were plenty of addons available including museums meals etc  To get to the boarding area of the tower an optional 8k won tram is an alternative to walking for 1015 minutes in 10C winter Theres also an elevator that goes to the tram that is free although hard to locate  The top of the N Seoul Tower also has a bunch of souvenir shops promoting merchandiseWhich is typical touristy stuff
2844,3,A great place to see a large part of the very large city of Seoul  It would be good if they cleaned the windows better
2845,4,Visited on a cold snowy night in Seoul Great views across the city and interesting history about the location We accessed it very a the Namsan Cable Car which was 34000 won for three adults Lots of food and shops if they s s what you are looking for Very pleased we took the time to visit
2846,4,It is one of those things where you should go at least once and it is good However I have seen several amazing towers and buildings in my day and this is not as spectacular  However it is a nice view of the city on a good night And it is probably a very good place for dating  Dont go up the tower itself it will just cost you money and it is not worth your money
2847,4,Not much to say but wow You can get spectacular views of the city from up here Not such a good idea to go here during weekends I went on a Monday and there werent a lot of people so I was able to enjoy the view  To get here get off at Myeongdong station I went through Exit 3 and made a 15min hike up to the cable car station to get to the tower Quite an exercise but it was worth it
2848,5,Such a wonderful landscape standing tall in Seoul A place you should not miss making a stopover while visiting the capital and take some epic photosfor an everlasting memory of South Korea and its beauties
2849,5,Beautiful place to experience the incredible views of Seoul The tower itself is well maintained and a fun stop on the tour of Seoul
2850,4,you gotta come here when its sunset  the view is magnificent  you can see the whole city with a glimpse of sunset  definitely you have to put it in your list if you ever went to seoul
2851,5,Great combination for this tour Namsan CableCar Through Orumi elevator  Namsan Park upper station of elevator  NTower  bus to Namdaemun market
2852,5,Nice display at night on the tower walls Some nice food establishments and shops therepleasant place for a date or excitable kids 
2853,5,U have to take a lift or otherwise climb up the stairs to get to the cable car station the ride was smooth and fast the sight atop was breathtaking As it was in Dec that we went it was cold when the wind blows Get yr portraits hand sketched by the 5 master artist I will want to go again
2854,5,This place is amazing You have a great view of Seoul from the top And the stores in there are good for souvenirs And I would love to dinner with my wife at the restaurant on the top And is good they close late after all my meetings
2855,4,Great landscape view of Seoul city during sunset Cable car ride was good Lots of picture taking opportunity Nice place to start off Seoul holidays
2856,4,Offers a very good panoramic view of Seoul Requires a lot of walking but it is worth the visit We took the No3 bus that stops by the base of the Namsan Park and walk for about 10 minutes from there to the top The new attraction OLed tunnel was amazing
2857,4,The place is crowded with tourists We walked up and took the cable car down Good exercise The queue to buy tickets for the cable car was long There is a mall with restaurants which you can have your meal Went there late afternoon and enjoyed the view of the day and night There is the love lock  where you can take pictures Didnt enter the tower there is entrance fee
2858,5,Weve heard that there are days when you cannot see anything but we were lucky enough to get there on a clear day and the view was wonderful
2859,3,One of the tourist photo vintage is this Tower Nice Place Beautiful view Good Managed  we arrived to this tower before dark and we could see beautiful lighting along walking upto the tower around 25 minutes good but in end December is too cold
2860,2,The tower is much better viewed from a distance as part of the city view Hordes of people visited the tower I was there; you are herded into an elevator that doesnt even have glass sides for the view Once you are at the top the entire area is taken with junk food and stalls selling tourist trinkets In three minutes you have seen everything  and then you get to stand outside for a long time waiting for the next bus down to the city Not worth the time  The length of recommended time i have indicated includes the bus trip  the time needed to see the tour is about 5 minutes
2861,4,We choose to visit this tourist attraction at night Place needs some walking before you can get the ride to the tower But all worthy
2862,4,We are glad to have come on a weekday morning took the advicestips from reviewers to avoid weekend Observation deck was lovely You have to come here by cable car We managed to stay at the sides for both trips and got a beautiful view Will definitely come here again for my next visit to Seoul And this time at night 
2863,5,I went there on a cold day I went there at around 3pm by the cable car Its a great time as we can enjoy the beautiful view of day and night The view is really great If you go to myeongdong dont forget to go there
2864,5,N Seoul Tower is the landmark of Seoul very worth to see during sunset or night time especially for couples Many shops cafes restaurants and there is a love lock plaza
2865,5,I had no idea that the surrounding city was so big until I climbed the mountain Its completely not necessary to enter the tower itself although I suspect its also quite nice at the peak
2866,3,I was expecting more from N Seoul Tower The tower is considered small as compared to many other towers I have visited  Only took me less than 30min to finish touring the Tower and this includes photo taking time  One thing good thou you can hang your love locks just below the N Seoul Tower and of course more photos
2867,4,Went at night via cable car  more expensive than I would have liked but the view was spectacular Kind of hard to get a good picture from the top because there are so many lights inside producing a glare There is a shop at the top where you can buy a postcard and stamps and mail a memento home took about three weeks to reach USA A fun way to spend an hour or two but I would walk next time
2868,4,Its a must place to go if you are in Seoul Nice place specifically at night but has a better view during daylight Must take the cable car going up just to feel the place Went there during autumn and it was cold 
2869,4,I recommend you ride the cable car to N Seoul Tower at night You will see how beautiful Seoul is with all the city lights There are always a lot of people which is why its kind of hard to take pictures You will also see a lot of love locks formed like a tree or locked on railings There are several shops and restaurants around Overall the place is lovely
2870,5,This was really fun Great views and a nice hike down Fun to get the popcornbeer packages Our kids loved it
2871,4,I agree with other reviews It wasnt phenomenal from a distance or from inside BUT these are the small things that I found very cool 1 Gift shop and candy store Very clean Decent prices Modern and unique gifts Not the same stuff as on the streets of Seoul I suggest buying the small puzzle and frame 2 Locks Bring a lock Put your name wish or prayer on it and lock it to the fence or one of many places Ive never seen this before I cant explain it Just bring one 3 Restaurants They were a bit pricey but lots of options 4 Elevator Cool video shown on ceiling of elevator with video going up or down Reminded me of Willy Wonka with Depp 5 Cable car going up and down Cool but packed 6 I think you can actually will or hike up to the tower That would be very cool to do in the future  Lastly We went with 4 year old up to 16 year olds We all enjoyed it
2872,5,Slope from the bus stop to the square is very steep There was some filming going on The view of Seoul city is very picturesque The observatory is a bit disappointing crowded and touristy Overall a lovely place
2873,3,Nothing special compared to any other but its ok I guess plenty of scribbles for those looking to leave a note on their walls
2874,5,We visited the N tower on Christmas Day and it was a lovely way to start our celebrations The view is awesome Definitely a must see attraction in Seoul Other reviews mention that it gets too busy so Id recommend going in the morning We got there at around 10am and it didnt seem too crowded but it was getting busier by the time we left  Getting the cable car up to the top will save you the uphill walk but it was great walking back down  there seemed to be a few different routes to take and the path we chose had great scenery
2875,3,Typical tower experience Its a must do to get a good idea of how big Seoul is It was a clear day so we got to see as far as possible with the smog
2876,3,Located on top of a hill or is it considered a mountain Namsan tower is a bit of a hike from Myeongdong station but visitors can opt to take the bus or cable car We enjoyed the city views and the free cultural dances when we were there
2877,3,We went there  it is freezing No cable car operating during freezing time  or only because our tour organizer just skipped it not sure as many other tower landmarksuch as Macau Shanghai and many others It is just the view only matters  Accept tower with adrenaline pumping attraction where you can walk along side on the outside of tower platform not so sure about this N tower Other than that either daylight or night it is really up to your choice but during snowy timeall I can see just white 
2878,5,came at early nightbut already crowdedquite tire to climb all the stairs manage to leave the lock and take a pictures at love chairsable to see Seoul at nighttry few snacks
2879,4,VIsited N Seoul Tower 30 December 2016 with my family coming from a package tour in Seoul The Tower is just a usual Observatory Deck Not too much impression compared to other Towers such as Taipei 101 Macau Tower Menara Tower in KL etc Though there is an outdoor Deck at the lower level the N Seoul Tower could still be developed to become more prominent and appealing to Tourists Overall the visit is fine and we also enjoyed the tour
2880,3,We made a mistake by visiting the tower on a Saturday The entrance was crowded and the line to go up the small elevator is also long Eventually we made it to the top and the view was disappointing The tower is not very high The view would be great if its not that foggy No doubt the view will be great if its a clear day I am just not comfortable crowding with group tourists for focal photo shoots We rounded the place the left in less than 30 mins Word of advise go on a week day It should be less crowded and maybe go at night The night view will be more impressive
2881,4,Went there on 1 Jan 17 and we had to queue for an hour to board the cable car to N Seoul Tower including buying of cable car tickets The day was foggy hence there wasnt much view from the observation deck of the tower What made up for it was the Ssentoy exhibition which my boyfriend enjoyed very much and the sending of postcards from the observation deck of the tower There is also a mini photo studio where you can wear hanbok and pay for the photo shoot We gave it a miss as the costumes did not look very nice There were some people queuing for the photo shoot though
2882,4,Get the cable car from the station to the top of this tower The views are amazing Bring a padlock as there are loads of them clipped to random statues here
2883,5,It offers the best of the city and we could see all the cherry blossoms as well It was not crowded when we visited which was very convenient Its something first time visitors should want to include in their itinerary in Seoul
2884,3,The place is very crowded It is located on a mountain so from there you can have a nice view over Seoul for free
2885,4,Obviously check the forecast On a cloudy day you simpyl will not see much It also gets really cold and windy on some occassions  Though if you simply like walking around a bit it still is ok to go With the love locks a pagoda and a bit of shopping and some restos you can still do stuff even without the view  The cable car ride to the tower is really short Slightly expensive for its length Can still offer good views
2886,5,Its worth it on a clear day Get the full ticket with your hop on off if you are using it Great views of the city But so commercialise Its all about buy buy buy
2887,5,It was a nice visit with Top Korea Tour that I have arranged to visit Namsan Park and N Seoul Tower In this tower you could enjoy the view going to the top with a package tickets price There were many floors and you cant believe it theres Hello Kitty Shop and Bears Museum too Many more and it is you to find out It is never regret to go to the Tower visit although it was a misty day Thanks to Juno our private tour guide for bringing us there and along the Namsan Park Freezing cold during Winter Check this place out and you will truly enjoy some little loveydovey moment on one of the floor
2888,5,Went here twice spring 2014 and December 2016 Although there were always a lot of people here I still think this one is a place to chill and relax from the busy city of Seoul I love the view and atmosphere here
2889,4,This place is a must see landmark So many dramas have used this as their location More than that the place has so many things to offer on every floor Theres restaurants arcade shopping selfie friendly places and culture Must not miss the deck area where all the padlocks are There is a restaurant on the top floor that will not serve you pizza if you order only one and you will share That was the only downside of our trip to this place
2890,3,Worth the visit great way to get a view of the layout of the city Make sure you take the cable car up  reduces the walk and a nice ride
2891,4,Although the location is not good it is worth to visit there You an see veru far away of Seoul form here On the way to there you can see a lot of lovers lock It is very amazing The entry fee of tower is low And the restaurant food is nice
2892,3,I think you need to get a perfect day from a weather side We spent 3 days in Seoul and there was too much fog everyday We finally went up It was nice but nothing special compared to other observation building around the world Hard to see much and not worth the price
2893,4,This is a significant landmark to visit as you can have a nice eye view for Seoul The area is not big and it take us less than an hour to explore this area
2894,5,Had a spectacular view of Seoul on top on the 360 degrees viewing galleryplatform A family friendly weather proof venue with many activities cafes and restaurants within the tower building It is also know as the Romantic Island as it is a favorite hang out place for lovers pledging their love for each other with love locks love tiles love benches scribbles A must go for love birds
2895,3,The bus ride up to the N Seoul Park is quite crowded but definitely an economical option to ride up the hill The base of the tower gives breathtaking views of the city Bring your camera and enjoy the views of Seoul at night
2896,5,The ride up the gondola was very exciting  get to the front so that you can see the view on the way up and down Then the line up for the lift to the top of the tower  we met some more international visitors Great view
2897,5,I had been for a conference at Seoul and on our day of outing we were treated to this wonderful sight  It is situated on a height and one gets a clear and beautiful view of the ever bustling and lively Seoul city from here They also have this concept of Love Lock here where youngsters purchase the locks and write the names of their partner and once they lock it they throw the key so the love is locked forever Although I did not do any of that watching the colorful locks in itself was a sight Besides they also have a shopping arena restaurant 4D screens photo booths and a lot of entertainment stuff to do here
2898,4,We got lost finding the cable car site and turned out walking all the way to the top one hilarious moment for me On the other hand we got to enjoy the nature and refreshing environment on our way up Really good place to exercise Also got to try putting on a love lock with by thenboyfriend
2899,5,We were here during last of the yearas it had extended the visiting hours until 1am There is a cultural show daily at the pavilion on 3pm to 4pm Ensure to download the Seoul Pass app in your phone to have a better chance of discount for entry to the tower Tower was surprisingly small compared to my countrys towers but you may find it lovely to see the skyline of Seoul
2900,5,I found the viisit to the tower very interesting for you can read the distance to most of the cities in the worldI met many interesting people over there
2901,3,Perhaps i expected too much but i felt that the N Seoul Tower paled in comparison with other attractions in other cities eg The Peak at Hong Kong The view was average and the locking of love gimmick was overwhelming The restaurants and museums there perhaps could offer a saving grace but I didnt enter due to time constraints
2902,4,Nice place to visit beautiful and a good experience especially in winter time However the visit to the observatory tower is a waste of time and money I think they carry too many people in the cable car
2903,4,One of Seoul attractions You could take bus or cable car to N Seoul Tower Go on weekdays since there are going to be long queue on weekend
2904,4,After rising the cable car uphill you will find th N Tower coming closer and appear in front of you in a manificient view in particular when you are going at night No worries it close at midnight and cable car service stop prior to it When it matched with the lighting of Christmas tree and an older TV tower it comes out sharp and stand for the signature of the city A good place to go definitely
2905,5,If you are located in Seoul first place to see is Seoul Tower even if you are in seoul for 1 day you should visit this place You save your time and money you can see all seoul from top of the rock
2906,4,An iconic site for Seoul tourism where you can have great view of Seoul City from 360 degrees angle and can put some love lock with your loved ones believe to tie any couples together
2907,4,The view was great once we got up there but the lack of signs and direction made it hard to navigate and get up to the tower
2908,3,the tower itself is average but it is pretty an night as it lights up never got a chance to get up there as the day I was going to go it was raining
2909,1,Crazy queue just to take the ride up to the tower especially on public holidays I went on New Years day so it was extra crazy waste of time in my opinion
2910,5,Its best to go here at night where the lights are turned on and its good for you to look at the sky and try the observatory Seoul is one of good light cities other than Hongkong so its worth a try to be there Restaurants here are expensive but its a famous spot for proposal and dating spots Try to lock a key here Its not a good choice to go here at night if you want to take pictures only so think of what you want to do here in N Seoul Tower
2911,5,We climbed up the staircases all the way up to the Namsan Tower for the first time in Dec during winter morning It was a great experience since we didnt want to take the cable car like other tourists The view were magnificient n refreshing since the weather was extremely cold  It was a great experience Will do it again when we are back in Korea again Advise dont climb during winter Its extreme cold 
2912,5,This was a great experience The view is amazing and I absolutely loved the love lock section It wasnt hard to get to We decided to walk up but there is a lift that will take you up as well
2913,4,This is one place to visit when in Seoul nice view from the top From myeongdong station exit 2 we take a long inclined walk going to the cable car The cable car is around krw 8000pax roundtrip that only takes few minutes to get you there The love lock is also located here Good view of Seoul
2914,5,Really cool to see seoul in a 360 panoramic view Its cool to see on each window to which city in the word it points to Also very informative On lower level there are some explanations about different locations in seoul There are snacks food and restaurants to choose from to dine and drink After that you can take the cable car to Namsan and continue the day there Really fun experience and great for photos
2915,4,Ive been to the Seoul tower twice and it doesnt disappoint me Make sure to pay and go up to see the full view of Seoul The toilet up on the sky deck was impressive Couples can also buy their love lock to put on the barrier Good for family and couples
2916,5,Can be a physical walk to get up to the base Alternative is a perambulator thar gets you to the olwer level elevator Once up there are great views shops eateries and a show as they change the guards Beware that view from the top costs more money and depends of the haze Copy of the Paris lock wish is also found here Locks available in the store
2917,3,We visited in October It was pretty bus that day The tour is not very tall in stature due to it being on a hillside instead of in the middle of the city Tokyo Skytree was more impressive for the experience Also its more on the outskirts of Seoul There were souvenir shops but they just didnt have the variety of items like postcards or magnets that other towers have There was also only 1 observation area so you can imagine it gets pretty crowded for those trying to catch a view of Seoul and hard to get a photo op without others in your shot The walk up the hill to the tour is manageable not too steep The trees along the hill path were turning for fall in late October Down the hill there is the Seoul City tour bus stop along with other tour buses
2918,4,Seoul Tower is located in Myeong Dong You can go up using cable car or by walking up If you need to buy souvenir for your friends etc you can purchase fridge magnet there because it is sooooo cheap I bought 10 packets 1 packet include 3 Seoul Tower magnet  it cost only 1000 won per packet
2919,4,A great view of Seoul It was a bit cloudy when I visited the tower Otherwise the night scene will be very nice Taking photo with the camera was challenging unless you place the lens against the glass
2920,5,This was a mustsee for me during my short stay in Seoul and on the recommendation of local friends we caught the cable car up and hiked down Being late afternoonearly evening it was predictably busy  about 4550 minutes wait for the cable car although the trip was then very quick We paid extra for the observation deck and the 360 degree views were fantastic We stayed long enough to see the City light up beneath us It was very busy and quite crowded but the views more than compensated  We chose to hike down which took about twenty five minutes One thing I would suggest is warm clothes as it was very windy as well as cold
2921,5,This place is so well set up There is restraunts places to buy souvenirs and coffee Many places to take photos great view all over Great modern atmosphere A must see in Seoul
2922,4,Prepare yourself for some climbing But its worth it good view while climbing up and down the hill and of course good exercise Visit the area to see the city from the highest point Seoul If you find love locks romantic have it there too
2923,3,You can see the tower from the bottom If you want a bird eye view of the city you can pay to go up the towers viewing deck Other than that theres nothing much you could do
2924,3,Its an okay attraction for family There are lots of restaurants in the park at the bottom of the tower You have to pay money to go up the tower though Good for couples for a romantic evening
2925,5,Took the cable car up here and I have to say there was a lot more to do than we expected Lots of padlocks of love attached to so many structures available to buy at the top Cafes shops couple of small childrens museums; hello kitty and other toys museums Great view at the top Hot chocolate at N Burger was great
2926,5,Nice view over Seoul Easy to access by walking to Nan San cable car station Everywhere you can see the lover lock
2927,5,Start the the tour in Itaewon or the shopping area and walk to the tower in the park The view to this big city is awesome watch the coreans and tourists drink a coffee and enjoy your stay
2928,1,As a famous hot tourist spot I could not accept that they dont have any notice  announcement for guests at the ticket office for cold wet weather  which the mirror at the tower was all cover by moist and nothing could be seen from inside So what is the point for letting guest to go up and cannot see any view expect fog
2929,5,We went at night the view was amazing Im sure doing the day would be lovely as well The night we went there werent too many people there
2930,5,It is a must go for first timers in Seoul The buffet at the tower is reasonably price with a great view Nothing can beat it
2931,3,It is too expensive to go up the tower but the view is amazing though You should go there at night to see the lights Also the restrooms have panorama views The tower is placed on the top of a mountain so try to find a shuttlebus  it is a very steep way You can find this kind of view at other places in Seoul therefore think about if you want to spend your money on this
2932,3,Good for seeing night view of Seoul but will be a bit cold in winter night 30 minutes to walk around will be good enough
2933,5,Go at sunset or at night  Theres a cable car for a fee but its worth it in my opinion  it takes quite some time walking up there  The tickets for the actual tower can be bought inside the bottom floor of the tower and we bought some popcorn and sodas to bring with us Actually we ate it during the rather long queue When you get to the top you can gaze out at the city in every direction  A must if you visit Seoul
2934,3,The cable car was short and slow you may want to take bus on the way back as this is cheaper option It many things to do and quite boring the viewing glass dirty with fingerprints cant have good views The restaurants is very expensive and not many alternatives for the cheaper ones The q is slow and long the bear museum was closed for good
2935,4,Accessible With old folk and young children we took namsan bus 5 from Myeongdong next to subway exit 3 without much walking can enjoy the nice view along the way Love Lock and good view Worth the trip
2936,5,A must see for all visitors It offers unsurpassed and unique views of Seoul and the immediate surroundings Cable cars take you to the base of the tower  a lovely park with spectacular views High speed elevators take you to the viewing platform where you can enjoy the view with  get this  popcorn and drinks that come with your ticket
2937,3,N Seoul Tower is best to go at night  I believe during offpeak tourism period this place is still very crowded Prepared to walk up a very steep slope There are a couple of public bus services that go there I believe Google can share more info on getting there  Besides the phenomenal number of love locks the place can be quite disappointing if you have been to a couple of towers in famous cities Compared to the Sydney Eye and Shanghai Oriental Pearl TV Tower the view of the city is that fantastic  You can buy the ticket to the Tower at a discounted price if you buy it together with a ticket to the Hello Kitty mini museum Unless you are a great fan of Hello Kitty the museum is very small and serves more like a couple of photo spots for visitors
2938,4,Could not appreciate the size and scale of Seoul until up high on the mountain and being able to see 360 degrees Bonus was live traditional music and acrobatic type performance on the viewing level in a small outdoor amphitheater type setting Great for an hour not more probably but worth going up
2939,5,The night view from the top was awesome No need to buy admission tickets as there are alternative viewing points which our personal local guide from tours by locals Denny taught us Saved time n money doing that His vehicle could also bring us all the way up to the building unlike big bus tours which had to stop a few metres away There was also a 3D roller coaster ride in the building for 5000won per person and a free 3D short clips That gave an overall awesome experience
2940,4,The view from that place is breathtaking Mustsee location in Seoul at Any time no matter what the weather is like its always beautiful
2941,3,Having been to Towers in different countries theres not much novelty left Unsure if I had missed certain sectionsbut I preferred Towers with some openness  Seoul Tower seems entirely enclosed Still whenever possible we do make a point to visit the Towers in different places  Personally I do like the lovers pathway with all the locks hanging at the railings  would have done it myself if I were younger 
2942,5,For starters if you love hiking  they have a perfect trail for you to hike on from the bottom of the hill to the top where the Tower sits You can make stops along the way to snap awesome photographs I am definitely not a hiker so I grumbled and puffed all the way up to where the Tower was located you can catch a bus if youre like me and you dislike hiking or you can go by cable car as well Even though I disliked hiking and climbing stairs I have to admit the view was to die for at every stop you make Venturing into the Tower itself was an experience of its own My favorite part of the trip up to the Tower was leaving behind a piece of memory in the beautifully designed memory trees you can buy locks to write on where you can stick to a tree or you can just enjoy reading other peoples memory locks Its a must visit the walk down from the Tower was magical in the night time during winter as well Will definitely visit the Tower again soon
2943,4,We started our walk from The Hyatt hotel and it was just all up Fantastic and lovely walk thru this park Loved how there were 2 gym areas to do you workouts lovely clean areas everywhere  this is how ALL of Korea is CLEAN AND TIDY Whilst walking we past a lovely small lake which has heaps of gold fish in it  however the lake was frozen  rather funny as we tried to drop stones on it to confirm it was frozen as it was 6 and we were loving it There was also a lovely kids playground and some interesting signs around the park Then came the huge steep hills they have steps or ramps to get up them which I had to do the ramp Definitely need shoes with a good grip Once we finally got to the top we found out that there was a bus that could take you to the top Id recommend this if you couldnt do the walk as its definitely something that you should see From the top we found this incredible view 360 of Seoul We had a lovely cheap lunch  pizza  drink  I was there with my brother  the restaurant took us to an area which was for couples  love seat with an amazing view Wouldve been great if I was with my husband so we got up  went to another area which was heaps cheaper  perfect for what we needed When heading into the tower be ready to gave your photo taken  to make a pose Unfortunately we didnt do it in time so we got a crappie photo There are shops underneath the tower however most of them went finished being built only a couple open so not really worth going into until theyre finished Enjoy the return walk as its mostly down hill we actually went thru a dirt track coming back and it went straight down the side of the mountain  extremely quickly considering it took as about 45 minutes to get to the top and about 20mins to go back down If taking the short cut be very careful but definitely worth it
2944,5,Luckily we bought the tickets online before we reach Seoul and the tickets were cheaper than from the ticket booths there Try to purchase the ticket from Klook or Kday as they are definitely cheaper and can skip the queue The cable car was quite packed and needed to queue for about 20 mins when we were heading down Love locks are just mere away from the N Seoul tower Do note that you will need to climb a lot of steps
2945,5,Must visit with family or friends there is a photo booth before the lift lobby and a restaurant at the top
2946,4,The views from the tower are the reason to take the 30 second elevator ride to the observation deck On a cloudy day the view was not as clear There are restaurants at the top as well as a candy store and souvenir area that you can purchase a post card and mail it anywhere in the world Kids enjoyed that and being able to send to their grandparents
2947,3,Great view over the city Very very very hot in the building it was not real busy so you could watch everywhere without always people in your comfort zone
2948,5,You need to walk up a slope to get up to Seoul tower upon reaching the top you are greeted with the fantastic view of Seoul city There are a few places for great photo taking There are some gift shops in the basement of the tower
2949,4,There is no better view in Seoul than from here We went at nightwhich was spectacular Take the tram to the towerit is fun ride We actually did dinner in the tower The restaurant revolves so you see all of Seoul over one hour There are lots of stores etc here also
2950,2,It was very crowded we waited for about one hour to board the cable car which journey lasted about 5 minute Upon arrival the wind was very strong and made it too uncomfortable for us to walk around I believe day view is nicer
2951,3,My husband and I went here at night because during the day of our visit it was really hazy We figured it wouldnt be as bad at night It was still hazy but we did enjoy the view We try to go to different towers at different cities I didnt really enjoy being squished in the gondola on the way up to the tower and the line to get back on it was long though The windows were very dirty from peoples forehead oils and kids fingerprints  so that made it harder to see and take pictures from the tower The best pictures we took of the city was just outside the tower actually Besides that we did enjoy it but wouldnt do it again
2952,4,Visited this landmark and on top of the view over the city we also got to appreciate some red leaves  We took bus 002 up n bus 005 down skipping cable car as read somewhere else that there might be long queues at cable car
2953,3,After a steep climb up the slope you take the elevator to the top of the tower Weather is not very clear hence reduced visibility Otherwise its a birda eye view of Seoul city But crowded with tourists
2954,5,I already walked up to the foot of the Seoul Tower in the week so this time with my wife we rode the cable car up  walked down very easy Best visiting in the evening just after sunset Amazing views of the city at night 
2955,5,If you going to soul you need to see the city from the tower its a beautiful view and you can appreciate the city
2956,4,This is one of the main landmarks in Seoul and a normal stop on any city tour  It is a nice and convenient way to see the city but it is quiet busy The surrounding park is nice for a little walk too
2957,4,This was a very quaint trip to N Seoul tower The tower itself is located in a Park with lots of interesting monuments and views looking over the city I would recommend to do the climb to the top rather than getting the cable car It is well worth it just to see the views of the surrounding areas The toweer itself is located at the top and has a small stone area in front where a martial arts demonstration was taking place when I arrived Very nice views would recommend if you have a few hours to spare
2958,4,It is best to visit at night  to look at the city night view or visit the observatory You can visit by bus or the cable car in Myeongdong
2959,4,It was good views of the Seoul city I specially liked the ritual of putting a lock here for your love
2960,5,Omg this is definately a must see We went at night and the view was soo beautiful It is definately a hike to the tower but there is alot of things to do there You have to pay to go to the top of the tower but the lines were really long so we did not go all the way to the top We did get to see all the locks and the view from there was already breath taking Definately do not skip out on this I would have gone at night and in the morning if i had time This was one of the highlights of my seoul trip
2961,5,We rode the cable car going here and the view was just amazingThis is a great spot to visit with family and friendsTheres the famous love locks and the iconic N Seoul Towerwhich are a must for every tourist visiting Seoul
2962,4,One starts enjoying the moment She enters with the wonderful colourful lights The lifts take us to the upper deck like any other towers and the shops up there commonly found It may sound very funny but dont miss the toiletsparticularly if your visit is during night Its a different experience you dont get in any other towers The walkway downwards is also very easy and enjoyable
2963,4,If you are into towers and seeing views from above then this is a great place Nicer at night however once you get up there it takes only 20mins to walk around take photos and admire the view There is a postbox upstairs where a gift store is located and postcards are sold Postcards are hard to fine illustration ones and view point ones anyways so if your a postcard collector might be worth purchasing the variety of cards there thats available When your done walk down to myeongdong strip down the stairs and walkway prob a 10min walk otherwise you would be paying an overcharge for set price taxis that are available on top Taxis are hard to come by on the top of you dont have a car
2964,4,Visited Seoul Tower during autumn November Great place for picturetaking You can take a bus from Myeongdong to Seoul Tower at about 1500won adult After alighting take a slow walk up the slope to Seoul Tower You can take many beautiful pictures while climbing the slope Beside the Seoul Tower there are rows of railing for people to put their love padlocks You can have coffee at the Seoul Tower and view the sunset at the same time They have Starbucks and other coffee bistro
2965,4,Came here cause when i visit a new city is customary to visit the tallest tower and see the view Up a mountain its about 40 min bus ride from Myeondong and its ok Its not bad view and i guess theres places to shop and eat but I wouldnt go out of my way to visit this again
2966,5,went on a clear day if possible so you could have a marvelous view of Seoul  we purchased a package that allowed us to visit exhibitions that were at the bottom of N Seoul Tower and enter the tower as well  the love lock that is selling at N Seoul Tower is about 8000won each SGD 970 cant remember the price well but i bought mine from Daiso in Singapore for SGD 2 Pen down my wishes on the lock in permanent marker prior the trip and brought it over to N Seoul tower  We then took the lift up to N Seoul tower a little ear block due to the pressure but it was fine  there is souvenir shop on top of the N Seoul tower and my friend bought a nanoblock version of the N Seoul tower i guess it was an exclusive item as i did not see it elsewhere in seoul  i did a touristy thing by buying a postcard and stamp to mail back home to Singapore  the price of the postcard varies depending on the design you choose and the stamp is about 100won it is such a small amount so i cant rem accurately There is a red mail box just next to it so after writing my postcard i just drop it inside  i posted on 1st november 2016 and received it back in Singapore on 23rd november 2016 it was kinda fun to see the postcard again brought back nice memories of the place  before we head down we went to the washroom we are still at the top of N Seoul Tower and boy we had a surprise we could view the scenery from the cubicle inside and it felt like i was given my own private piece of serenity paradise while being inside the cubicle so i cant help by taking scenery photo inside the cubicle after i finished my business of course   we went down and visited two exhibitions according to my friends the exhibitions might vary from time to time so during our visit on 1st november 2016 so one is about Hello Kitty  another one contained Marvel superheroes  Disney related characters we spent about 12 hours at the exhibitions not inclusive of the duration up in the tower there are also little merchanise corners as well  it was worthwhile spending the time there   i really enjoyed myself at N Seoul Tower especially with the autumn leaves changing colours they add vibrant colours to the pictures
2967,4,I visited N Seoul Tower during Chuseok holiday in September You have an option to go up by bus or cable car which you must try it both A little bit crowded but well worth to visit
2968,4,A good half day outing right near downtown Seoul We took the cable car up visited the tower and walked back down which even in late fall I found quite pretty
2969,4,I was trying to find the right amount of reviews to find out the best way to visit the tower or if its worth to buy roundtrip tickets for the cable car We were a group of 7 people and not all of us are physically fit for a hike especially during winter After some deliberation we ended up buying a one way ticket up and decided to walk down going back It was a great decision The walk back offers a nice lovely stroll even if its relatively short in distance I would recommend walking down instead of hiking up I see a lot of people doing it the other way around and see them panting like crazy Take the cable car to ascend to the base of the tower instead Note though that even if it says it is open till 11pm some sites even say midnight the cable car operates until 1030 pm only We went during winter and the place was freezing but its still a nice little spot above the seoul skyline Also you gotta join the lovelock bandwagon The locks cost around 6000 to 10000 won without the permanent marker That costs another 1000 won  I would say that witer time and night time would be best for lovers Not a lot of people and you can find a nice sweet spot somewhere everywhere
2970,5,We chose to walk up its a pretty hefty climb but you get some stunning views on the way up If walking is a problem the cable car costs 10000 won one way Definitely recommend going at night to see the beauty of South Korea with all its lights but I imagine it would look just as incredible with clear skies Entrance is 10000 we got the combo deal which was 20000ish for entry for 2 2 drinks and a popcorn drinks arent alcoholic which we thought I believe you can eat there too for a price there is also a separate hello kitty room and what looked like a marvel type superhero room which again is extra money
2971,4,Yes KR is cold  colder in the mountains Bring sweater jacket scarf gloves  hat for no regrets Beautiful on a good night We went during the day since too tired the beautiful night before Although it was super attractive that night  To get to Namsan Orumi elevator to Tower cable car get off at shopping district metro stop Myeongdong Use exit 4 to pop up at the McDs Enter small street next to it bearing right to deadend Go left  make 1st right to major cross street At cross street look left to see elevator Its about 5 mins walking through back streets  Seoul Tower was one of the highlights of our Seoul experience Ill be surprised to hear any disappointments Expect a half day evolution
2972,5,A 20 minute ride by taxi from Gangnam district to the cable car station where you get a ticket to go to the base of the tower Keep in mind that there arent a lot of cable cars and the queue can be a long one You can pay for the tickets by credit cards An enchanting wall with love locks at the base of the tower is a must in Seoul where you can buy the lock from the top Scenic images from the top with the city skyline are priceless  On your way down you can walk and grab a coffee at the many coffee shops on the road to the bottom
2973,4,We went with our two small children and it was great From the top of the tower there are some amazing views of Seoul Unfortunately it wasnt super clear but we still had a good view We took the Namsan Cable Car up to the top it would be a huge hike to get there if you dont take the cable car If you go in the winter wear layers it was really hot in the observation area There is also a place buy a love lock so bring WON or bring a lock with you
2974,5,I came in october And really cold But a great scene up there in the tower we have a cup of coffee there to warming
2975,3,Go during the day as it is even more crowded at night I visited early during the day around 1030am and it was not so bad  the crowds only starting coming in at noon  The observatory was in my opinion not really worth it even though I got my ticket at a discount
2976,2,Maybe because I was there alone but I feel that N Seoul tower is a tad too touristy and the view up was great but spoilt by the cloudy weather in the autumn morning  You do have to pay to go up to the TOP of N Seoul tower this is an addition to the cable car ride from Namsan CAble to the tower which is perched on TOP of Namsan mountain However if the view is already cloudy as you could have observed from the cable car ride up you may want to skip paying to go up the tower  Instead spend some time strolling around the area and have a nice slow walk down back to myeong dong area a relatively short walk from namsan cable if you are fit for walking  for lunch It will make quite a good morning work out   Oh before I forget do check out the toilet in N Seoul tower if you did spend the money to go up  it has amazing view from the cubicle  I took quite a few pictures just being inside the toilet
2977,4,Seoul tower is one of the attractions to South Korea will go to to walk for an hour in the mountain road remember is a running activity while taking pictures play ground to walk finally came to the bottom overlooking the scenery of Seoul is very good buy tickets tower the scenery is pretty good city night scene is very beautiful and across all kinds of tower at night however do not too big difference Tower outside the night scene lighting is great have contemporary feeling looking forward to the stage of the shop a lot but the pictures of the reflective has affected people probably because there is no thought of a lot of people want to take pictures but behind the glass reflects light On the glass with different angles on the name of the city and the distance from a distance you can see through the distance it is need to take the elevator to the attic an elevator has film not boring On the first floor on the ground beside lover lock Taipei 101 Tokyo sky tower Malaysia has a twin while Seoul with Seoul tower
2978,4,Beautiful scenery and relaxing place Seoul Tower have nice scenery esp during autumn and spring seasons a great place for all family couples and friends
2979,4,   500        From car park area to the tower base is about 500 m with the slope up walkway The viewpoint you can see around Seoul so beautiful
2980,5,Have been to Korea few times but first trip to N Seoul Tower Was planning to visit in the afternoon to see the Autumn leaves But was told that evening view would be better Got up there at about 530 PM Met up with the beautiful sunset Like a sea of rainbow
2981,4,N Seoul Tower is one of the famous scenic spots in Korea We can choose cable car or walking up to the top of the mountain The most special is that there are thousands of locks full of the handrail like a wall The lock represents lovers lock The couples will write their name and something they want to say in the lock After they locked the lock in there they believed they like the lovers lock will lock together and will love each other forever This is a romantic place and full of couple love in there It makes us want to take a picture and also want a boyfriend Moreover we can go the top of the tower We can view the whole Seoul in there But we didnt stay until at night It is to be regretted that we miss the night scene I guess it must be great Besides there are also some restaurant and cafe shop let people take a rest Next time I want to go to there again
2982,5,This is a fabulous tower accessed by either walking up a lovely park or using the cable car Visited early in the morning so no queues however allow plenty of time if you want to go up at night as it is very popular It has a variety of food outlets and viewing areas and is a place all tourists should visit
2983,3,it was nice but i think it was a bit expensive i think its a good place for tourists to go similar to the pearl tower in china
2984,4,I would highly recommend couples to go Seoul Tower There is a symbol for lover to visit You can take pictures in everywhere There are three main parts which are Seoul tower bear meseum and lock bridge No matter you go in the morning or at night The view is really nice At that time I went at night so I dont have chance to show how it looks like in the morning Every time when I go there there are a lot of people such as tourists visitors and even local residents You can choose take bus and walk to the tower or take the cable car I like walking up to the hill because you can see different sides of view of Seoul But just for reminded it is kinda hard to walk the slope This time I took the cable car to leave Seoul tower its amazing Because you can see the other side of Seoul You can see in the picture The view is really nice But the picture couldnt show it clearly I didnt have time to visit the bear museum But I walked around outside There is a souvenir shop that you can buy the model of Seoul tower And there is a store that you can paste your picture on the wooden board But it takes at least 20minutes to produce one
2985,4,Take a cable car to reach For couple there is a lockbridge which u can use pad lock to lock on the bridge for forever mean hahaha need to buy ticket for observatory
2986,3,Beautiful and romantic place to see Dont forget to visit the love locks and take a photo of it the view is very nice and awesome
2987,5,Got there during bad weather there was thick fog and it was raining While i was drinking some tea in one of local cafes weather improved and i decided to go up Did some really nice timelapses with my phone during daytime and some really nice pictures of night Seoul in the evening A must place to visit for everyone especially photographers
2988,5,A beautiful spot with incredible views of the city made even more beautiful by the bright fall colors Watch your little ones because the fences wouldnt be up to the building code in the US and the hillside is steep
2989,3,its a touristy place where one can get a view of the city If you go there by bus 05 from myeongdongchungmuro metro station be prepared to walk a bit as the bus will drop you at a stop station near the entrance where you will need to walk uphill for around 10 min The bus ridewaiting itself is about an hour  hence if you dont have much time you would want to consider taking the cable car There are a few restaurants at the deckbase of the tower we took a return one way cable car ride costing 6000won A return ticket will be 8000won
2990,4,This is actually anothe one telco tower used in the past renovated to serve as a tourist attraction The view is great if the sky is clear or you can go nite time to enjoy the city lights Other than that nothing really special Surrounding area is v beatiful and has some interesting trails to walk
2991,3,The tower was ok Nice views But I was disappointed in package I bought Two beers popcornride up for two Sounds like the top would be a nice place to have a beer Wrong you carry the beers and popcorn up the elevator stand in crowd drinking the beers
2992,3,We waited 1 hr to ride the the tram up the hill to the tower Once there the view of the city is gorgeous but then theres not much else to do Very touristy place and high prices
2993,4,The N Seoul tower complex includes restaurants a viewing deck a tunnel of love and some shops We went to the shops took pictures at the tunnel of love which is a staircase with a led ceiling Then we went to the viewing deck to take some night shots Passing there youll notice that there are thousands of love locks attached to anything We then went to the N Burger restaurant We basically saw everything but did not take the elevator to the top of the tower because reading from the reviews its not that worth once you are on the viewing deck and we got happy with the view from the deck If you are in Seoul you will probably enjoy this place
2994,5,I travel a lot for conferences and meetings world wide That most includes a lot of sitting and inactivity So it was a real pleasure to work the many steps to the Seoul Tower And the view of this gigantic city  twice the size as my country  was amazing
2995,4,The views from the tower would be great if the weather is good unfortunately for me it was very cloudy and foggy so couldnt see much Anyways the ride up on the cable car was interesting
2996,4,My friend and I went at night time Its easy to get there but if you want to catch the free shuttle from myeongdong station to where the cable cars are better check the time schedule of the shuttle before hand My friend and I missed it so we took a cab and paid 3000 won for the ride Actually its pretty close because my friend and I just walked back when we went home but those are your options The waiting line can get pretty long for the cable car ride but it moves fast It can get pretty windy and cold once you get on the tower area cause its high up so Id suggest bringing a jacket even if youre there during summer or spring The night time view is really pretty It gives you a view of Seoul and I bet it also looks great during the day as it is at night If you are going with your lover you might want to try the famous love locks
2997,5,I came twice in my first time to seoul Im so happy whene I came here for the second time I got free magic show that so funny If you go there You can use bus no 5 from myengdong st exit 3 and from chungmoro st bus No2 And if go there by cable car from myengdong sr exit 3 or exit 4 to cable car station
2998,5,A lovely place to celebrate our wedding anniversary From dinner at nGrills revolving restaurant to the placement of our padlock with the thousand others or the cable car ride to and from the tower this is a most memorable place to visit
2999,5,I have walked around this park several times You can make it up to the top in less then an hour depending on how fast you want to make the trip Great trails both on asphalt and through the woods So nice variety Amazing 360 degree views around the city Can take the tram down as well
3000,3,The actual tower viewing platform is quite small Recommend to visit at least once but might not warrant a second visit The park below the tower is quite scenic and also has some performance on occasion
3001,5,A mustsee and dont forget to bring your own pad locks with your names and dates on it They do have locks for purchase at a reasonable price Its an awesome sight to see You can either go up with the cable car or walk up which is very steep Very hot during the summer
3002,2,Perhaps it was my poor experience at the buffet restaurant HanCook the long wait at the Namsan cable car station or getting ripped off by taxi drivers at the Namsan cable car station taxi stop  that led me to such a poor rating  N Seoul Tower is one of your typical observation towers among its brethren  eg Space Needle CN Tower Calgary Tower etc And like these other observation towers they do provide nice views of the city probably the best time to arrive to these towers is a little before sunset at a steep cost  My first annoyance was the shuttle that they provide from Myeondong line 1 is very confusing I waited at the stop and the Namsan Cable Car station shuttle came by My original intention was to take the bus directly to the tower as it was cheaper than the cable car and I heard not so positive reviews of the cable car The bus driver who was clearly English deficient or purposely deceitful told me I was in the correct bus  then promptly dropped me off at the cable car station I have to imagine that this is a scam as you then have no other alternative to get to the tower other than using the cable car The cable car cost is approximately 750 USD vs app 2 USD for the bus ride So I relented to buy tickets only to have to wait around 3045 minutes for a chance to ride the cable car up be aware of the Disneylike lines which hide the true wait time  The cable car itself was standing room only The views going up were a bit disappointing and IMHO not worth the extra 550 USD You can see a nice view of Myeongdong but you dont get that super wide panoramic view of the other parts of Seoul The ride is short as well  app 3 minutes  I arrived a little after sunset so that may have tempered my opinion of the place as the views were much more limited at that time You do have views of various areas of Seoul as well as an area where people chained these love locks to a fence similar to a bridge in Seattle various restaurants souvenir shops etc I didnt realize the Alive Museum is there I went to the one in Jeju and wasnt too impressed  We decided to purchase dinner for HanCook restaurant the buffet restaurant at the tower for approximately 88 USD for two The only nice thing about this is that the price includes a trip to the top of the tower I have a separate review of the restaurant but I can easily summarize the restaurant as terrible I was able to walk around the tower after dinner  there isnt too much unique to see in the tower itself We then took a walk around the area at the base of the tower  and again there isnt much unique to see in terms of shops or restaurant  We took the cable car back down  the wait was much less The trip down was uneventful However I arrived back at the cable car station base a little after 830 PM and unfortunately the last bus to Myeongdong departs at 830 PM Obviously the cable car station ticket office doesnt warn you about this Accordingly you are left to the wolves  in this case the taxi drivers I didnt want to walk back to Myeongdong so I approached a taxi driver for a ride back to Myeongdong The taxi driver immediately indicated it would cost me a 20000 won rate up front 17 USD for essentially driving less than a few miles and actually Myeongdong is literally only a mile or two away from the Namsan cable car station I should have called an UberBlack car at that time instead of taking the taxi But the lesson is  beware of the Seoul taxi drivers  Anyway N Seoul Tower should probably low on your priority list of Seoul attractions as there are many other worthwhile attractions to go to
3003,5,How beautiful night view Little bit hard to go to the tower but clean air You can take the bus to the tower also
3004,5,The way up to N tower look like heaven covered by yellow and red colour of autumn Its wonderful to be there The lock bridge is colorful Luckily it was sunshine I took hundreds pictures there 
3005,5,We took the cable car to get to N Seoul Tower It was a nice ride overlooking Seoul The place is really nice Its also perfect for couples as it has a romantic feel
3006,4,I highly recommend N Seoul Tower visit at night time to capture the night life of Seoul city It is a romantic place for couples to snap their photos  definitely a tourist attraction
3007,5,Seoul Tower is one of the places I constantly come to each time I visit Seoul The best times to visit are at sunset but beware of the long queues at the cable car starting from about an hour before depending on what season youre there In spring daytime is lovely as there are many cherry blossom trees along the way up and in the surrounding areas you can choose to hike up to enjoy the greenery but the cable car offers a view as well If youre there till late the tower will be lighted up and you can also get a lovely night time view of the city You can choose to hang love locks in the designated areas and there are also restaurants and gift shops for you to spend your time in You can also pay a fee to go up to the tower peak but the view from the public area is good enough for us
3008,5,Take the cable car up to the top of the mountain to the tower Besides going up the tower there are a couple other stuff to see or do there with occasional cultural performances happening outsideBring your own lock or buy a love lock there to add to the millions already chained there The view at day and night are worlds apart and if you have time you should def see both or possibly go slightly before sunset so you can get them both in one visit Definitely add this to the todo list
3009,4,Great views of Seoul from the tower and surrounding park area Take the street level elevator up instead of the climb along steep streets
3010,5,This is of course a very touristic place to visit Be prepared to walk up long hills just to get to the top Not for those with health problems or bad knees The tower itself is just like any other tower in any other city The locks are nice to look at around the tower It is definitely something to see if visiting Seoul
3011,1,I went up on a misty night and somehow I assumed it was an open air deck It was not And the windows were all dirty from smudges The view was therefore nothing to write home about Had I known it was a windowed deck I wouldnt have paid 10000 KRW for it Absolutely not worth it Any observation deck that is not open air is in my opinion an obscene injustice to the actual view  The view from the bottom of the tower is far better
3012,3,It is better if you come here with your lover You can buy locks to lock on or go to the top of the tower
3013,4,Easy to find from the subway Lots of coffee shops and food at the bottom 10 minute walk to cable car Great view Wouldnt recommend paying an extra 10000 won to go to the top
3014,5,sure there are many people but this wont stop you at all from enjoying this beautiful place its hard to say either this place itself or what this place can show you is real beautiful try to have a peek in everything single things around here it definitely worth your time
3015,4,Every major city has a tower now which lights up in the night and gives a wonderful view of the city Seoul tower is unique because it is situated on a beautiful hill and therefore is good even on day You can take a bus or walk if you are very brave and it is very nice Must go
3016,1,We started our visit in N Seoul Tower at 4pm in the afternoon My friends and I spend more than an hour in queue just to get to the Tower via the cable car Another hour to buy our ticket and wait for our turn to go up the Tower 15minutes at the top of the Tower 30minutes to get down the Tower Another hour in queue to ride the cable car In short our time was wasted in queue and the entrance fee and the cable car fare were not cheap Were not sure if were simply unlucky that the queues were extra long or if its normal If its normal I wouldnt suggest going here
3017,4,Set in a lovely park the view is everything you would expect It is touristy You have to pay extra to go right to the top There is quite a bit of the normal tourist trash there but the view is great Would be nice to have a bit more information about what you are looking at but a good way to spend a few hours We walked to the top and got a tram down
3018,3,While we thought that when we paid to ride the gondola up to the tower it included all fees to go into the tower Sadly you have to pay admission again when you reach the tower base There are restaurants shoppettes coffee and juice stands and the base and in the tower as well All in all for the price it was ok We went at night so it was a bit cold
3019,5,We walked from our hotel N Fourseason to the N Seoul Tower If you dont like walking the seemingly endless steps you might as well take the cable car We walked because the queue for the cable car was so long We wanted to see the sights before sunset as well as the view at night Bad idea to go on a weekend if you hate crowds and long queues The walk up although tiring was still an exhilarating and a wonderful experience The views are breathtaking There are nice restaurants up there as well as a mall it was not yet complete the time we visited
3020,4,To tell you the truth I was not so interested but my host wanted to take me there We took the cable car up and walked down on the way back If theres a long line dont panic in Seoul long lines dissolve very quickly and the longest you might need to wait is 20 minutes  When we visited the institute was decorated for Halloween and had some Halloween themed extra products and services  The view is nice and interesting distances from other countries displayed on the windows  The gift shop is great albeit expensive  compared to other museum gift shops  You can buy a postcard with a stamp its a package and send it  Once outside dont miss the other sights  we did  Bonus the toilets are Instagram spots theres an Instagram frame on the windows
3021,4,Enjoyed a lot with friends to see the Seoul view  Suggest to go clear day  We enjoyed the cool environment fresh air abs walk 
3022,4,Generally not big on these attractions but gave it a try  tickets reasonable Total touristy attraction but great views Never seen so many gift shops Well done with ceiling video on elevator ride
3023,3,If you have been to the Shanghai Pearl Tower or Tokyo Tower this is another must to visit when you in Seoul We bought a super cool Seoul Tower model in a snow ball as a souvenir from the bottom shop
3024,5,Amazing view and unforgettable visit especially in winter  a must see in Seoul where you can enjoy the Cable car ride to reach there
3025,4,Super nice view of Seoul Gets very chilly at night though Might be cheaper to take the bus from Myeongdong than take the cable car especially if youre not a fan of cable cars P
3026,5,N Seoul tower is must see attraction for tourists Adjacent to green plush Namasan park this attraction is full day activity In night you will see colourfull view of Tower Food snacks and drinks options available Government as well as tourist buses operates here No personal vehicle allowed near Namasan park in order to maintain green park and environment Superb and must visit location In order to show love to your soul mate or girlfriend or boyfriend you can tie clock
3027,4,It looks more like a radio mast from a distance but I would strongly recommend visitors go here The views are fabulous there are normally shows of some sort on the platform there are nice walks round the towerhill and cafes for a snack Take a loved one and add your padlock to the trees and just relax Then take the cable car back down and watch as the scenery opens up as you drop out of the tree line Great
3028,4,Generally it is the place to go if you want a panaromic view of the city Taking a cable ride is the faster and easiest way to get to the top but for the more adventurous and fitter ones a hike up and down will be more fun
3029,4,The N Seoul Tower was an interesting site in that it seemed to offer different people different things There was an element of fun mixed in to the back drop of the great views of the city plus the trees and nature that is the Namsan Park  I didnt go up to the observation deck itself I chose to stick to the viewing platforms around the tower which provided multi level views of different sides of the city  One of the striking elements would be the love locks that are pretty much every where A lot of couples come up here and the sheer number of locks is a testament to that Whilst I came here during the day time you can imagine during sunset and the evening that this would be site for many couples seeking a romantic respite from the city below  Around the tower itself aside from the park are restaurants and cafes that give you the opportunity to just relax and enjoy the environment For families aside from letting the kids run around for a bit there are fun characters to take photos with  Whilst I wouldnt necessarily say its a must see Id suggest choosing a time of day that meets the objectives of your visit whether it be as a group family couple or Individual and just enjoy chill out and enjoy yourself  Note I took the cable car up and a bus down The walk from the metro station to the cable car station is very steep so take it slow walking up or consider getting a taxi if youre with people less mobile
3030,4,I like its location easy and accessible if you go to Seoul this place must go quite interesting and from there you can see many places of Seoul Just that need to line up for at least 12 hrs
3031,4,To visit Seoul tower is a most because The view from The top is magnificent If The weather is clear you can see allmost The hole city And dont forget to buy a love lock before you go upits much cheaper down in the city The lock is for couples in love and you can put The on allmost antingen upthere
3032,5,It was a beautiful place to visit in Seoul You must walk up quite a steep hill Be prepare for that hike The garden of love is beautiful with the puff heart shaped structure and the surroundings This view is probably better during the day but the view from the observation deck is better at night
3033,5,This is a nice tourist attraction that the family can spend 2 or 3 hours easily There are several stories at the base of the tower with food and souvenirs
3034,5,The MUST SEE place when you are in Seoul Korea You can see beautiful Seoul from the tower Very peaceful and unique
3035,5,Go on a bright sunny morning  be prepared to walk You can always take the cablecar down From the hotel I stayed in there is a nice view of the tower from the restaurant  watching the cable cars going up  down in the cheerful sunshine makes you want to go up to the tower When I did make the trip up the fresh air  very good views made it an enjoyable morning Just visit the tower  see it for yourself Form your own impression
3036,5,I was amazed at how much stuff is up on top of the mountain from which this tower arises Restaurants galore and not cheesy Seems to be popular outing spot for locals not just tourists
3037,4,If you have time  its nice to visit  The view was amazing but its quite nice to have coffee when you see view
3038,4,We went up there in the evening before it got dark It is the best time to see the city both in the day and night Being autumn the garden was filled with colours Good photo taking spots
3039,3,Want to see the city from above but dont want to be overwhelmed by concrete buildings This tower is surrounded by trees from Namsan park Before heading to elevator youll have a quick picture taking and one reached the top your picture is done with few different backgrounds of Seoul tower for a fee Exiting tower theres a restaurant down below the stairs and youll find 3D show from ceiling and huge TV wall Nice Its nice to be in nature park but the tourist can be overwhelming Just wish they can limit the number of people to enter the tower and park
3040,4,We took the Seoul city bus hop on hop off bus and it brought us to all the main attraction sites This particular stop dropped us off at the foot of the mountain We took the trail up to the tower It was actually steeper than I thought I was a bit afraid that my 2yo son might roll down the trail Took us less than 10 minutes to get up to the foot of the tower There is a few restaurantsa square that has entertainment and lots of love locks  Tip there are 2 trails 1 is the main steep trail that everyone takes on the right On the left its more like the back trail it is less steep and it leads you to an elevator wheelchair accessible you can also take the stairs up We took the stairs down There was practically no one so we are able to take some great pictures Theres also a Hanbok store that you can rent at a hefty price
3041,4,On the top of a mountain the tallest tower in Seoul gives u a spectacular 360 degree view of the city You reach the tower via cable car which costs 10000 won per person and around the same amount for entry into the tower itself Food isnt great and the souvenirs are a bit tacky But the experience itself is really nice
3042,4,For a first time visit to Seoul it would be good to consider the N Seoul Tower as one of your destinations Of course there are other similar places such as 63 Building for instance but N Seoul Tower would be the easiest for a first time visitor  To get up to N Seoul Tower you would have to get to the Namsan Cable Car first The cable car itself is about 15 minutes walk from Myeongdong Station The cable car will get you up to the top of Namsan Park in about less than 5 minutes However be prepared for a wait of about 30 minutes at least during peak hours Of course there is the walking option from the bottom if you do not wish to wait that long  If you wish to take a good shot at sunset or at night I would say that it is actually better to take it from Namsan Park right outside the N Seoul Tower rather than at N Seoul Tower itself As we went during sunset time it was quite crowded even outside N Seoul Tower itself but the views are quite amazing even then I would advise coming early to get a good view  We went up to N Seoul Tower and found that the views are great but there is not really too much difference from the views outside N Seoul Tower though Because of the glass panels at the observation deck it can be a little difficult to take photos without having reflection in it It is better to go during the daytime if you wish to go up to the N Seoul Tower in my opinion  There are a few restaurants serving those who are hungry for a reasonable price along with a good view of the Seoul skyline as well Overall I would say N Seoul Tower would be good to visit once but there are probably other better places to view the Seoul skyline perhaps even for free too without the crowds
3043,5,I love this place and I like to visit there again If I have a chance I could visit there with my girlfriend
3044,4,I went there at night this place is suitable for everybody The facilities are awesome View from above are so nice  With the view of love lock everywhere makes this place so romantic and very suitable for couples
3045,5,Able to sightsee Seouls night views and theres romantic restaurants up and down of the tower Able to go for jog or ride on cable car
3046,4,Perfect night scene overlooking Seoul city However if youre into taking pretty photos I would recommend that you go in the day instead Mustbuys at Seoul tower would be the teddy bears dressed in traditional hanbok at the teddy bear museum Good as gifts or a keepsake
3047,5,It was a hazy day when I went Despite that it was a worthwhile visit The park at the base of the tower is very beautifully decorated by thousands and thousands and thousands of colorful locks It was incredibly spacious with lots of trees flowers and sculptures We didnt take the elevator to top of the tower due to the weather I enjoyed the view and the walk around the park the souvenir shops etc
3048,4,From Seoul Tower you have the best view ever for Seoul  Easy access with several buses taking you there  All facilities as good coffee and a meal while being there And of course you take the elevator all the way to the top 
3049,5,Be sure to go to the N Seoul Tower Options include walking up limitless stairs or taking the gondola up to the tower  suggested Once there 360 degree views of Seoul A variety of restaurants available for all tastes Good experience for a couple or a family
3050,5,Theres a free open deck to see amazing views over the city Its not necessary to pay to go up to the top of the tower You can reach by bus or walking The park is really beautiful
3051,4,Great view from a high place Going all the way up the tower is a little pricey and not really worth the money as you could probably see the scenary even from the base of the tower Nevertheless scenary is amazing
3052,5,Arrived early10am and took the cable car up the mountain walked around the observation deck Lots of places to take pictures and a few stores for those souvenirs Wonderful walk down the mountain
3053,5,This place if you are staying at any of the hostel near nansan you can just climb up to the cable car area to take cable car or climb all the way up 
3054,4,This is one of the highlights of my trip to Korea From the subway had a long walk and took a cable car to the NTOWER Offers great panoramic views of the city Went to the topmost portion of the tower which they call the OBSERVATORY They have several decors where thosein a relationship sealed them with padlocksAt the ONSERVATORY there are souvenir shops some sort of museum and an Illusion show
3055,5,I suggested you to take the cable car if you would like to climb using the hundred or I thought its million stairs But if you reach the top that would be a great experience nice view saw a lot off lock loveflowers ahhh sweet
3056,4,We walked there on one of the hottest days in Korea It was so hard to get on top of the mountain the heat nearly killed us So I recommend everyone not to walk there unless the weather is nice  not hot or you want to die of exhaustion like we nearly did But nevertheless when you are on top of the tower and you can see Seoul from above all your worries are forgotten The windows were a bit dirty though so the view wasnt the best The price was OK for a small fee you even get a popcorn and coke about 1 I think
3057,1,We are residents in Seoul since 4 years and we went every year more as twice up to the tower It was a nice green place within a busy town I remember 3 years ago it was a relaxing walk up and down and also the tower area was quite peaceful Somehow I have the feeling it is worsening year by year The operator has started to renovate and offer now several floors with shops restaurants and whatsoever Some of them opened and just closed again LOL Why Because probably not many people will spend a penny there There are mainly interested in making selfies Thats it And who shall buy all these things you really dont need We went there and left every time at least 50k for tower entrance and a beer coffee or ice cream There were a few shops totally enough to serve visitors And usually you climb up to have a nice few and not to drink and eat whole day long Anyway this time is over for us spending any coin there This year every time we visited the place it was totally over crowded If you want to visit towers upper floor you shall wait at least an hour or even more Especially on the weekends Same way down I can be wrong but since 2015 it changed dramatically We usually walking either up or down along the small road I remember the time when we saw many people using the bike to go up Time is over Now every minute some old diesel engine is rushing uphill to unload and to come back to collect again Some of them are driving fast and reckless If you have kids you are mainly busy with watching them because you are afraid that something happened I really wonder why Seoul citizens are not doing much about it Did they gave up already Do they like how it is This place becomes really disgusting It has nothing to do anymore with a nice beautiful quiet green park and place It just became a polluted place of commerce We will not visit again We are done with this tower Have fun
3058,3,Useful for getting a feel of the layout of the city but not much more than that as a foreign visitor There arent really any landmarks I was particularly interested in seeing And its not even in the top 5 of the tallest towers in the world The smoggy haze also limited what would be seen  The best part was seeing Hello Kitty World with my daughter We were the only ones in there at the time and had a blast being silly and taking a ton of silly pictures Coming from the US Hello Kitty World is a novelty item for us
3059,3,Its a good spot to admire whole Seoul expecially at the eveningnight You cand get there by a cable car or bus There may be a really long queue for the calbe car A lot of people during weekends and holidays Nice place but it is not a must see in my opinion
3060,2,Sure there is a great view of the city from Seoul Tower but be aware of what it will require to see it I strongly recommend NOT going on a Friday or Saturday night I was here before and it was just a long wait This Saturday night it was a hideous wait around 15 hours to get up the cable car then another one hour minimal to go up in the tower The cable car is around 10each the tower is more than 20each At the tower you will be bombarded by over pricedunder quality food selections like N Burger the worst burger in my life I hear there is a bus you can take to the tower maybe that would be better Taxis cannot take you there or back from there so thats a real bummer I would not do this again unless I had some assurance of a shorter wait In total took us over 3 hours to get to the top of the tower maybe a bit more not worth it
3061,5,We rode the bus to the topbut many people were huffing and puffing their way up the steep and winding road Once on top you can walk around a bit to get your bearings and head over to the ticket counter to buy tickets to the observation deck The elevator takes you to the top and you can spend as much time as you like taking in the view of a very very crowded city of skyscrapers It is hard to believe the amount of people 10 million who live in the city until you see the vast spread of high rise living Next go down a level that I think is actually better than the top level Go down to the bottom and spend time looking at all the love locksthey are EVERYWHERE We rode the cable car down just for the fun of it Otherwise you can use the steps to get back down to street level or catch the bus
3062,4,The views from the restaurant near the top of the N Seoul tower were breathtaking Be prepared to walked up a very steep hill to enjoy the views
3063,4,You can view all of the city on a clear day The day that I went it was cloudy and you could barely see past the river but still a worth while trip I took the train to MyeongDong station and walked to the tram that will take you up to the Seoul Tower and I bought a round trip ticket On a nice day I would have done one way up and walked down Its a fairly steep trek up Once off the tram at the next viewing area love locks were placed everywhere so if that something you would like to do you may want purchase it before getting there or pay 8000 won As you proceed it does get a bit commercial and you can pay to go up to the observation deck There are several places to eat at and I opted for HanCook which is inside the Seoul tower but thats another review and Im happy with that decision
3064,5,Has an incredible view the pictures from there are fantastic Highly recommendedWould undoubtedly
3065,4,Very busy at night up the tower Pretty view during the day but more spectacular at night We were lucky enough to go whilst there was a Hello Kitty museum exhibition held inside
3066,5,Difficult to imagine the lay out of this huge city from the ground Come up to the tower and enjoy a 360 view of Seoul If the weather is fine walk down the path instead of using the cable car
3067,3,Go to the top of the hill and we can watch Seoul If you like to watch Seouls lights go to N Seoul tower at night If you go with your couple bring a padlock
3068,5,Short walk from Myeongdong and a must to visit There is a free show of martial arts in the afternoon which is quite impressive Lots of places to eat You have a very good aerial view of whole of Seoul and can take great photos
3069,4,Came here in the evening to see the night skyline The cab fare from Myeondong area to cable car station is about 4800 won Beware on return there were some cab drivers who demanded 20000 won because these are the waiting cabs Dont give in just wait for those that drop off passengers to this spot It is a bit much to walk up in the dark narrow road So take the cable car Be sure to stand at the windows of the cable car to see the view going or coming down You have to pay a separate entrance fee to go up the Seoul Tower The sight up there is just ok but I guess as a one time visitor you ought to try The souvenir shop at the top and the lighting inside distract the view towards outside at night While there do not miss the locks of love at the foot of the tower Now that the famous love locks at the bridge in Paris near Notre Dame cathedral had been cut and removed you should visit this one
3070,4,It was a nice hike up the stairs to the top of the tower Plenty of photo opportunities along the way Quite a few stairs and there is a small exercise park included on the trail as well Getting closer to the tower there are food stands a monorail where you can ride to the top and usually the traffic is pretty heavy Further up theres a landing where you can buy a lock and attach it to the rails and stairs wherever theres open space Its a really popular thing for couplestourists The view at the top is great and you can see all around Lots of souvenir shops and restaurants too Great to visit day or night
3071,5,First you need to take a cable car to the bottom of the tower where you can find some restaurant coffee shop and many lovers lockssimilar to france where young couple express their love for each other
3072,5,Very entertaining place So happy seeing padlock love and walking around namsan tower There hello kitty island when we visit
3073,3,A visit to this tower is a must do while you are staying in Seoul You can go by stairs quit a walk or by lift There are also many restaurants at the tower but a bit too touristic for what they offer You must go there at night Seoul by night is nice to overview Entrance is not expensive
3074,5,Great view of the city from above We got there late in the evening and the elevator line was 50 minutes as everyone wanted to be up there for the sunset I am guessing the line would be shorter in mid day But still a worthwile destination
3075,5,Seoul Tower is a must Recommended route is to take a cable car up this mountain After that  take a trek down towards Hilton direction and visit Nandaemun Its a good view from the top down to Seoul Recommended to do it in the morning or evening with the sun shining down
3076,5,Went to N Seoul Tower on the first day in Seoul It was interesting trying to get to it as we were on foot and decided to tackle the train and the bus We ended up just outside of Namsan Park by a public library and found a map Once we oriented ourselves we saw there was a tram and made our way to it  We were a little touristy here and paid for the 2 beers and popcorn A little on the excessive side but it made the experience a little more interesting Afterwards we did some geocaching and went back down on the tram  Overall it was a really nice tower and definitely something to check out in Seoul
3077,2,Ive visited many cities and enjoyed city views from many towers and definitely this is not one of the best towers Ive been so far Once you buy your ticket at the counter you are asked to wait 4050 minutes to get into the towers elevator Once upstairs the windows were a bit dirty so the view is not the best Lights inside the deck are on all the time so is difficult to take good pictures because of the reflect on the windows Waiting time to get into the elevator to go down was more than 40 minutes I didnt find any positive point to talk about
3078,4,Awesome 360 degree views of Seoul First you need to take a cable car to the bottom of the tower where you find some restaurants coffee shops and many lovers locks similar to France where young couples express their love for each other The view on top of the tower is awesome make sure to go on a clear and sunny day
3079,4,I am a little disappointed with this attraction Except for the great view of Seoul There is nothing too impressive compares with Tokyo Sky Tree
3080,3,We visited the N Seoul Tower at night The view of the city was great but there was a wait to go up to the observation deck and a huge line to wait for an elevator to come back down Also the lights from the shop and food stand reflected off the glass making it hard to take good photos or just to see the view clearly I did like the fact that you could skip the photo taking which most tourist spots try to force you to do  It was great to see the city all lit up at night but it wasnt a stressfree and completely enjoyable experience
3081,5,Actually nothing special with this place Just ordinary tower But the special things is entertainment inside special effect lift and the keylock park You should try the popcorn sold near the ticket box it was very delicious
3082,4,So let me start by saying we did not do the tower tour We went up to the top of the mountain on a shuttle bus from myeongdong took in the view and turned and walked down the same way we came up We hopped on the shuttle bus expecting to head to myeongdong but these shuttle buses do not run on a loop To leave from the mountain you will need to go the opposite way down and you can ride the bus down if you want It was horrible busy when we were up there and the buses were beyond full so I recommend going on nonpeak times if this is an issue for you
3083,4,We didnt even know it existed There was a booth at a festival promoting so we went on a whim Catching the subway and then bus to get there was fun The practically 15 minute vertical hike up the last stretch to the entrance was a real task The tower itself is average as tour towers go but its something to do It was a foggysmoggy day so the view was just OK  Theyve mimicked Paris with this lock  key program for couples Cute We took the cable car down It was fun because it was a new adventure But its got family appeal Im glad we did it
3084,5,This is a great place to see the whole city from On a clear day I am sure you would be able to see into North Korea but as I went up at night I cant confirm The area outside has some attractions of their own as well such as an old temple and walls full of padlocks
3085,3,The views at night were uninpressive comparing to other observation towers in the world New York Toronto Chicago London or Paris  maybe because of the distance Probably better to be visited during daytime
3086,3,its a landmark that most couple will visit to lock their love scenery was awesome and there is a few restaurant there
3087,4,Nice to visit with your significant other for a romantic night out They sell locks in the stores there for you as well as permanent markers  Great view Theres an entrance fee for the trolley to go up the mountain 17 Canadian for 2 people  This place closes around 11 or 1130pm
3088,4,Well staying nearby at Banyan Tree Seould we decided to walk up there Got lost on the way but then saw the nice sunday crowd of families and friends planning to go up They are offering a combo set for 2 which includes 2 beers and popcornjust like for a movie so we settled for that Views are obviously the best in town but it was slightly foggy on the day A real 360 views as you can walk around Direction of international cities on the windows are a smart addition Worth the visit but not unforgettable
3089,4,A really nice place to relax but be prepared for the coldness I went here during autumn and the stairs after taking the cable car to the tower Theres Teddy Bear Museum hanbok rental and love lock shop too
3090,3,It could be one of the most beautiful places here but unfortunately usually there is fog or smog in the city so the view is not so nice And it costs some fee just to get to the tower foundation as well as to get to the top
3091,3,It seemed like the thing to do so we booked a tour that included the N Seoul Tower It was nice but basically like any other space needle Our guide had us up to the top pretty quickly but if you have to wait in those 12 hour lines find something else to do
3092,5,Sightseeing on the top of hill overlooking whole citywide  Most of the year of visitors from China Taiwan Hong Kong Europe and the other side of the world
3093,5,We did the visit by walking all the distance to the tower and get back by cable great experience All the stuff very well organized all for your pleasure and experience Crowded in the weekends
3094,4,It was a foggy day so we cant see too far away My son loved it as there was performance nearby the N Seoul tower We took two cabs to the tower and found out that cabs cannot go up directly One cab dropped my family nearby the cable car area and the other cab dropped me off at the bus station that goes up which is two different end Please communicate with your friends or families on the dropoff point if taking more than one cab
3095,5,We visited the Tower by taking the cable car That was really Nice Nice view from this area and even better from the Tower Nice Food also at the burger restaurant
3096,4,Great view of Seoul city from Seoul tower Taking a cable car to the tower is recommended unless u have a very good stamina The environment around the tower is good but sometimes it can be pack with lots of tourists
3097,3,Kind of disappointed when I came to this place The shipping area is almost deserted Only the upper deck was busy with visitors Come here only for the view there are other places you can go to for a better view of the city skyline and its free or if you want to have some romantic time with your other half and immortalize your love with a lock on the fence gag
3098,4,Like most cities with observation spots this is no different We went to this one after a rain and the views were great Looking through the mountain ranges around what would normally be river views were actually towers of apartment buildings It really brings home how many people live here It has a 360 degree platform and world cities with their distances on the windows so that adds a little fun to things
3099,5,Take the gondola to top of the tallest mountain in Seoul and then take the elevator to the top of Seoul tower and enjoy the fantastic view Its worth it 
3100,4,Its fun and good place You can see view of the Seoul city  but is pretty cold xD If you no take bus go up then you have to walk around 4km and I choose the way to walk up its very tired but is a good experience Cause the bus is Long q so we walk down too You will walk down is very very fast 
3101,5,Going up by foot its quite a struggle especially if dont like walking Itll take 2030 mins walk uphill Better to ride the bus or the cable car going up
3102,4,An easy place to visit to get the overall city view of Seoul Also taking this chance to experience Koreas bus ride Travel by Namsan yellow buses No 2 3 and 5 that circle the hill The walk to tower is very pleasant in the spring air and beautiful floral exhibit along the way up On the way down you can chose a bus that stop at Namdaemun market where there are quite a few food alley
3103,5,Another attraction with our tour Inline for the elevator  we waited and were asked to take a photo great photo should take onethe elevator it self was fun to be on  it was like a 3 D show for you to see look up they told us and before you know it you there It was a good experience
3104,5,While in Seoul you can see the North Tower from almost any location Visit here in the fall or winter for the best photos The restaurant inside has an amazing view but is a bit pricy
3105,5,We took the hop on hop off bus to stop at N Tower The view is amazing unfortunately it was hazy the day we went They have an entertaining show of music juggling and sword fighting at 3pm which we were lucky to catch The children had a blast watching the show You can take photos with the performers afterwards but have to be quick as they only cater for that for the next 5 minutes after the show
3106,5,A must see This place is pretty huge Much bigger than I expected Has a great view of Seoul City and is very clean Went during the day and will go during the night on my next visit
3107,5,went there by subway train and got off at myeongdong station exit 3 walked about 20 minutes uphill to the cable car paid about 8500 won for return tickets per person could be crowded at times but definitely worth the scenic view of seoul added attraction would be the locks of love and bear museum ticket to the observatory cost us 10000 won per person
3108,5,Spending time at the observation deck of the Seoul Tower is a great way to spend the evening and watch the sun set over the Seoul city skyline I visited in October and the wind can be rather strong but it added to the wonderful experience
3109,5,if you wanna see the view of the city esp at nighttime with glittering skyscrapers and lights from the highways and running cars it worths going to this attraction at night the lookout provides different angle of city hill skyscrapers and Han river If you are bored with tower or something highest in the cityJust forget it  looking around Namsan park at ground level is also recommmended
3110,4,The view is nice but not of the most exciting I have seen Between the cable car and the tower itself there is quite a climb Not easy if you have physical limitations During week ends can be very crowded When you buy a ticket for the tower elevator they have a very convenient system by which they tell you at what time to take the elevator If in doubt there is a screen at the entrance which says which ticket numbers are being admitted
3111,5,Dont go on a public holiday or you will be waiting a LONG time Get the cable car to the base then get a ticket to the top There is a candy bar at the top in case you get hungry
3112,5,Went here around 4pm to catch the sunset which was a sight to see Took the cable car both ways but if you are adventurous you can walk it specially going back The view was spectacular and worth climbing up to Food here can be a little pricey so would recommend to have a bottle of water and some snacks with you since its all walking and climbing
3113,4,The place is so romantic in the late evening when the sun is setting  Climb up to reach the Seoul tower is steep and uphill for about 5 mins  Prepare good walking shoe Great place for couples and Photographers  Well kept Place and amazing view of Seoul for me as my last day memory there Great end of 10 days in Seoul and Jeju 
3114,4,Its good to be there Specially if your are good at walking If going during winter take care of the kids as it gets windy and chilly But an excellent place for couples  Valuable Tip Walk to the tower is more fun than being on top of the tower
3115,5,We took the short ride with the cable car to go to Seoul Tower The love lock balcony was great very colorful After reaching the top of the Tower the view of the city was amazing
3116,4,I have been to N Seoul Tower 4 times  all on a different season If it is your first time to Seoul N Seoul Tower is definitely a must visit attraction You can choose to walk up take a bus or cable car  queue for the cable car usually quite long be prepared to wait for an hour or so sometimes even longer
3117,4,As with all my reviews to sights in Seoul I will preface this by advising visitors to carefully check opening days and times and whether timed entry tickets are needed to access certain parts of the attraction and also the times for booking guided tours in their language of preference  bearing in mind that numbers can be limited  I was in Seoul for nearly 3 weeks and had only 2 days when skies could be declared relatively clear A combination of poor weather and pollution means visibility can be poor and that would not be good for a visit to the Tower Luckily the day I chose views were quite good  It is possible to walk all the way from Seoul to the base of the Tower But its a long steep uphill trek and most people go by bus or take the cable car Even tofrom the cable car station there is a challenging flight of stairs  The attraction is popular and busy Entrance tickets are timed to avoid overcrowding and it is possible to reserve tables at the various restaurants at the summit where expensive set price menus are offered  The observation decks are well thought out with each window containing a description of the direction you are looking Gentlemen must check out the lavatories on the observation level  the views are great  Visitor amenities are excellent Outside there are pleasant grounds and further vantage points to observe the panoramic views of the city and beyond
3118,5,worth to come here you can go around late evening or at night you can either walk till the top or use the cable car you can enjoy the view of the Seoul
3119,5,Not to be missed You get a good view of Seoul and there are quaint attractions at the top too Noteworthy are the relatively reasonably priced souvenir items that would have cost triple in cities like Singapore or Hong Kong and the quality of the trinkets are actually good
3120,5,We went to the tower at 11 am and there were no lines not even for the cable cars The view from the tower was outstanding and to me well worth the cost If you go check out the restrooms on the fourth floor One wall is a window and the other wall is a mirror We also enjoyed the burgers served at the outdoor restaurant
3121,5,walking up takes around 15 minutes on top you have an amazing view Taking the cable car on the other side down to seoul city
3122,5,I would recommend going to this place around late afternoon so you can see the sunset and enjoy the night lights Of the city There are restaurants around the area as well Beautiful place and it was certainly worth the trip going up the top of the tower
3123,4,never miss this place if you are in seoul although theres a long walk uphill to reach the tower its worth the climb stay as long as you like to maximize every spot that is pictureworthy
3124,5,This is a must stop in Seoul Get a cab to Seoul Tower tell the driver Seoul Towa DO NOT try to climb that hill it is a lot further than what it looks like Youll need to pay for a ferry ride RT to the base 8500w then around 6000w for the tower
3125,5,I recommend this stop to anyone visiting Seoul  This is the best vantage point to take in the enormity of Seoul which is one of the largest cities in the world Greater Seoul Metropolitan Area consists of around 25 million people There are multiple places to eat in the tower that cater to various budgets There are always festivities going on in and around the tower throughout the year There are also multiple ways to get to the tower including walking trails public bus transportation and a skytram  Tip  Plan accordingly on special dates We tried to go to the French restaurant located in tower on Valentines Day and that turned out to be a nightmare Seemed like half of Seoul had the same idea
3126,3,Well it takes quite a while of queuing until we could finally enjoy the view It is a nice view especially from the toilet on the way down Dont miss it
3127,5,It is my first time went to Korea I am longing for the country is Korea I heard something from the person have been to Korea She said N Seoul Tower is a symbol in Seoul If I go to Korea must visit the Seoul Tower I waited for the bus in a long time If you do not know which station you should get on or get off just follow the crowd A lot of people go to the Seoul Tower by bus When we arrived at Seoul Tower almost 630 pm Therefore we can enjoyed the sunset on the bus There are a lot of couples and thousands of love locks on fences It is really a wonderful view Many people take pictures to keep the beautiful moments The view of Seoul from the top of Tower is stunning It offers a great view of the Seoul city scapes
3128,4,The views from the tower are outstanding but its a bit pricey It costs about 8 to ride from the ground to the base of the tower but another 10 to ride from the base of the tower to the observation deck There are restaurants both at the base and on the observation deck and the deck has a coffee shop and souvenir shop to purchase items to remember your stop Otherwise it was a great visit and easily reachable by the subway though it is a bit of a hike up hills on sidewalks
3129,4,This place was very busy I suggest taking the hop on hop off bus up there which is what we did as we spent the day using it to see things The bus drops you off and it is a steep hill to the top There you can see beautiful views of the city There is a love lock area which is nice fo couples and some cafes and eating places We did not go up the actual tower it was about 10 AUD We decided not to as there was a beautiful view without having to go up and it looked very busy  our experiences with these towers is that it is so busy up the top you cant really sit down to take in the view however you can decide for yourself
3130,3,The tower is not very high For myself i feel its not very impressive There were some features but generally i didnt feel it was worth the time and money Maybe for the youger generation its awesome and fun
3131,5,You can see breathtaking city views from Seoul Tower We purchased tickets for the tower but realized we saw everything from the top of the hill that we saw from the tower We bought a love lock to leave behind there were many options of food to choose from and the cable car made the trip up and back very quick and convenient
3132,4,View from the top is fantastic especially in the evening when lights are illuminated Go couple of hours before dark to appreciate the lights of seoul
3133,4,If you want to have clear view of Seoul from above you should come in the daytime But nighttime will show you the city light The price quite high now is w8500 for the cable cab and w10000 for the tower ticket Make sure to visit the lovelocker outside 
3134,3,Pick a non cloudy day otherwise there is not a great view We also went on a holiday and it was 15 hours to get up to the top
3135,5,We have been up to the N Seoul tower several times and it is always an amazing time This time there was a really cool traditional dance and fightingbattle demo going on What a treat that was Make sure to have a couple locks of love to put on the wall
3136,3,Its really hard the tower is located in a hill w tried with many buses but it was almost impossible The best option is a taxi or the specific buses that go there Even though the tower is nice
3137,5,Its a must go for all couples its so romantic up there with a spectacular view of Seoul remember to get the locks too
3138,4,Nice trip up to the tower Here you can see Seoul the inner circles but also the outskirts with hundreds of white sky scrapers in a circle around the city where probably millions of families live And notmto forget the love locks probably more than one the bridges in Paris
3139,5,We walked up as the cable car was not running because of the earlier lighteningAlthough it was a long way up there were plenty of rest stops and the scenery on the way up kept you goingLovely view sober the cityamazing views from the toiletsWas nice to go up again for night photos but cable cars very busy on way down
3140,5,This is one of the must sees when visiting Seoul The park Namsan that the Tower is located in is a real breath of fresh air in the otherwise quite polluted Seoul There are many walk paths and things to see in the park so make a day trip out of this attraction
3141,3,This tower gives a great view of seoul but its not much more than that Take the cable car up to the tower the plaza surrounding the tower is probably more interesting since they sometimes have shows going on there
3142,4,Came here as a solo backpacker at night time Stunning views of Seoul even better from the top of the tower It was extremely busy on a weekend night so I spent most of my night waiting in lines  The whole area is geared towards couples eg love lock walls photo ops with love hearts seats on an angle that make you lean into each other so I guess would make a good date spot  Would suggest not bothering with the ticket packages that include drinks and popcorn by the time you are done with lines you will be nearly finished it Would give it a 55 if i had a significant other with me lol
3143,4,I was alone in Seoul so I didnt feel romantic being up there What I found awesome about this place was that I could walk from the bottom to the top using the forest trail not the main road The air was so fresh and I felt so relieved walking up to the top It took me about an hour or so
3144,4,If you go to Seoul you must go to the Seoul tower you see all the city you can do a lot of things inside and you can take a very beautiful ropeway
3145,5,We accidentally walk d to the top whilst looking for the gondola station oh well it was a nice walk and was quite a clear day when we got to the top so we could see for ages  great view of all Seoul We bought a combo ticket and got free popcorn and drinks  bargain
3146,4,I visited around 6pm and it was great to see the view on top I took a bus no 05 from myeongdong Around the tower many spot to take a picture The weather was perfect And also you can take a selfie on the restroom because you can also See the view 
3147,5,Definitely take the cable car as its more dramatic to get up and go ride the fast elevators to the top Great view of Seoul 360 of Seoul and the surrounding communities
3148,3,Youll have to be patient during the long line to use the cable car but once you get to the Namsan tower the view will be worth it If you want to access the revolving restaurant at the top of the tower youll have to make sure to make a reservation weeks before you head there
3149,5,Super nice to have the look over Seoul We chose to go there late in the afternoon and have dinner there later cause like that we could both see the view in the daylight and at nighttime Its free to go to the top of the hill but it costs 10000 won to go all the way up to the tower I didnt do that though since I thought the view was good enough  my friend on the other hand did it and he thought it was absolutely worth it We took one of the many buses to downtown and it was super easy and cheap  Besides from that I can highly recommend to have dinner at the N Burger place  it was cheap and sooo delicious
3150,4,The best time to visit N Seoul Tower would be around 5pm; this way you would be able to see Seoul in 3 perspectives day sunsetdusk night Typically the Namsan Cable Car is recommended as a means to go to the tower; however personally Id rather save money and take a tourist bus This is because they cram too many passengers in a cable car that theres not enough room to actually appreciate the sights Though the bus takes longer it does give you a scenic tour around the city  There are other attractions aside from the observatory deck so while waiting for sunset or evening to arrive; you can use the time to explore the other facilities A feature that really won me over would be the country viewpoints that it had; wherein a window is labeled with names of countries and their respective distances from the tower My friends and I were just crowding over the Manila window the entire time
3151,4,Its not easy to get there if you have problems walking but the view is a reward you you do Awesome view 
3152,3,There were very long line when we get there but its ok since it was early evening and people might want to see night veiw of Seoul but I could not believe the cable car It sounded abnormal and made me and my family scared since it was trembling a lot when it arrived at the top I thought it was very old cable car so it must be replaced with new one If you are afraid of heightdont try it The N seoul tower itself was good to look around entire Seoul night veiw
3153,5,The best views of the city of Seoul by far I would recommend going late afternoon so you can see the view of the city in day time then see just how far the city is spread out on the landscape at night  further than you can see during the day We did the touristy thing and put a lock on the fence with our wedding date you can see that there are so many they must cut them off regularly explored the grounds and then headed up to the top of the tower We also had dinner at the restaurant up the top and it was very enjoyable Would highly recommend spending part of an afternoon  evening at the North Seoul Tower
3154,3,If you will not go to the observatory and you are single this place is not for you Riding their cable car is overpriced The place is good overlooking cold  Bring your own lock if you want to lock your love You might hesitate to bought their designed lock after seeing its tag haha But overall you will enjoy the place because of nature lots of locks and the tower 
3155,5,dont miss this place if you want to visit Seoul  you can see the city from the top tower  it worth to visit this place before going up to the tower you have to come by the cable car to the NAMSAN PARK you will see a huge collection of the love locks  I highly recommend to visit this place
3156,4,This is one of the most touristy places weve been to in Seoul It provides a good view of the city The love locks and the benches designed the way they are to force shy couples to sit together are also cute The price to get to the viewing deck is 10000won per person and 21000 for two with popcorn and drinks The place is ease to reach by bus or by cable car We also saw some people hike so I think thats also an option and a fun way to get to the top 
3157,4,So you basically go up the tower walk around a bit to see the view but after that you dont really have a lot to do The gift shop is super expensive They do have a cafe right there so having breakfast near the view is highly recommended
3158,4,Take the trolley You may have to wait but the walk is brutal Very nice view you wont get anywhere else We didnt go up in the tower itself extra but I dont think we missed much
3159,5,Really worth it to go up and enjoy the nature of rocky mountain by cable car to reach to the tower to enjoy the city seeing
3160,3,Like most tallest towers in the world this was a very busy place even on weeknight There is an impressive collection of love locks and a post office at the top of the tower that sells postcards with stamps so you can write home to mum
3161,4,I went to this place with one of my colleague and we spent very good time thereWe went to this tower by the Namsan Cable car ropeway Alternately if you love trekking you can climb up the stairs and go to the tower also There was fees to take the cable car ride but it was an awesome experience I visited this place in July Many recommended us that it is not the proper time to visit as we would not be able to see the panoramic view due to fog But we were lucky that for few seconds the fog went away and we could take the glimpse of the beautiful view of the entire Seoul We were very happy when the fog got cleared When we get down from the cable car there were colourful locks everywhere which was called as lock of love  I think those people whose wishes were fullfilled had tied them But it was a very colourful view everywhere colourful locks we we went the top most point of the tower there was a post office which was the highest post office of Seoul and there in a shop postcards were being sold Young girls were posting love letters from the highest post office to their love It was a very fun filled visit I liked the place and would recommend every visitor of Seoul should visit this place but you should check the weather first
3162,5,Take the cable car up to the base of the N Seoul Tower Youll find a number of shops and cafes great views and literally thousands of padlocks Most importantly youll find the ticket office to buy a ticket to go up in the elevator in the Tower level 5 observation deck where the 360 views over Seoul are very impressive On the observation deck you can send a postcard and buy sweets and gifts Level 7 of the tower hosts an upmarket French restaurant which I did not visit myself Take the elevator back down and treat yourself to an ice cream a coffee or a bite to eat Its a great way to spend an hour or two
3163,5,Highest place I think in Seoul The air is cold even on summer months Romantic place to be since you can lock your heart with someone you love on their love lock
3164,3,We waited in the massive queue for the cable car ten mins Then decided to walk up the hill instead rather than wait any longer The queue was down the street outside the building Anyway the walk was great hard work but you felt great at the top 20mins later after the lactic acid subsided Lift to observation deck was cool Kinda disappointing as way to busy to enjoy at night although nice n cool The padlock thing is mental here More than Ive seen in Sydney or Amsterdam put together
3165,5,Excellent place to visit with family The bridge is full of love locks where visitors locking them all over the bridge Also they do some traditional show close to tower
3166,4,We loved to watch the entire city of Seoul from above The sight by night was amazing and brings a good sense of the size of the city Huge Must do
3167,5,We hiked from the bottom of the mountain to the tower Very scenic and good exercise Some shops and restaurants up top It cost about 15 to go to the top of the tower so we skipped that Very nice time
3168,4,Go here at night because the light from the city is splendid The only thing bringing my rate down from a 5 is that the fact that there is to much background light in the tower which is ruining the photos if you dont press your camera against the window It would have been nice with an open air platform without a window
3169,3,I wne tot he Tower on a Sunday and it was very busy  Did not go in and to the Top the view from the top of the cable car was really beautiful and I did not feel the need to go all the way
3170,5,Here you can enjoy a great landscape of Seoul were the city starts to crawl the mountains around the centre Went during the day and the view was amazing there is also places to eat in here You can walk all the way from the train station or take the cable car
3171,4,Well we have visited many Sky Towers in different cities in our walk around the world and every time when we come across a new one we would not hesitate to visit it because the view on the city will be different and will gain unique and wonderful experience  So in our recent Seoul trip we decided to visit the N Seoul Tower It was about past 400pm when we arrived and the place was still crowded with visitors mostly foreigners The viewing point on the ground floor was already awesome and it was built on top on the hill Along the way we saw trees with LOVE LOCKS besides the the mental railings that also have such locks too It was so colourful and impressive Unlike the love lock bridges in European cities mostly located above a river where one would throw the keys into the river after locking it right here there is no river but one can throw the keys down the hill Haha you can actually buy a lock in the souvenir shop  Upon entering the tower via the main entrance we immediately saw a souvenir and gift shop with a lovely Hello Kitty display at its entrance and no one could withstand the temptation for not taking a photo with it  Our fullday city tour guide had gone to the ticketing booth to get us the ticket to the top while we were busy taking photos with the Hello Kitty  Then we took the elevator to the top according to our guide the tower was about 250m tall about 80 storeys if I didnt remember wrongly While most elevators in other Towers are standard and quite boring while moving upwards the ceiling of the elevator here has astonishing moving animations that depicted moving into the space galaxy and it was indeed impressive So everyone in the elevator were kept occupied and so focused on it and forgot the time spent in getting up there anyway it was quite fast too think less than a minute  When we arrived at the top wow The view here was spectacular We walked around 360 degree and really have had a great bird eyes view on Seoul could see the Gangnam area South of the Han River Myeongdong etc As the sky was still bright the view was cleared We really enjoyed the view so much  There is also a souvenir and gift store right well where you could grab some candies tshirts postcards etc here Though the place is touristy but they had some promotions and so the items we grabbed here were still reasonable in price  After our visit here we took the elevator down to the 1st storey where we had to walk through a tunnel with LED TVs on both sides featuring Seoul in different times and development phases via computer graphics and animations on the other side they also have TV screens that show the history of the country as one walks around It was very interesting and fascinating and no doubt why Korea is so advance in IT and technology  Well if you like heights and good city view from the top of the world this place will be relevant and good for you As mentioned earlier each sky tower is different and offer different and unique views on the city and so its unfair to compare with one to another Visit with an open mind and with the feeling to see and experience new and different things your visit here will be fun interesting and wonderful
3172,5,My family and I went to visit this iconic place and can say that I truly enjoy the view that the tower has You can see all of the city from the top and the sunset is amazing I really recommend visiting this place
3173,4,i went to the N Seoul Tower via bus 02 from Myeongdong Cathedral Its cheaper than taking the cable car that tends to be overcrowded taking a bus takes you from the bottom of the Namsan Mountain and a little winding road going to the tower few notable places are in the Namsan Mountain such as a school and a library i think not sure from the bus stop you need to hike but hiking gives you a nice vantage point for picture taking wink wink
3174,5,I dont do heights so I didnt go up the tower but walked around the base  and that is a cable car ride up the hill and lots of stairs  Theres a burger restaurant churros and ice cream also on offer at the base And a small gift shop There are also many artistic displays featuring padlocks Very colorful  There were about 50 of us in our group the rest all went up the tower and loved it
3175,3,Share you lover locks view isnt as spectacular Mostly another tourist spot Busan tower was better
3176,5,Some friends and I had a blast last weekend hiking around Namsan park to get to the N Seoul Tower The tower is spectacular from every angle and there are lots of cool views of the tower from Namsan park Once we reached the tower we enjoyed some live music by the temple and had dinner  ice cream at the shops near the base of the tower There are lots of fun and affordable souvenirs available at the gift shop there too We would recommend arriving at the tour around 5pm to be able to see the view of the city transition from day to night It was really exciting to see the lights of the city come on as daylight fell We were also lucky enough to witness a beautiful pink late summer sunset from the top of the tower This is an amazing place and a mustsee for anyone visiting Seoul
3177,4,We visited early in the morning at around 10am and there were already a lot of tourists there We went up and it seems like most of the tourists were still below taking photo as it was quite empty above We have the entire observatory deck to ourselves However we could not really see far as it was quite foggy  Couples can pen down their love messages and put up both love locks and love tiles at the love lock section and the love tiles section in the tower  A must visit for couples
3178,4,You can not get a full appreciation of the size of Seoul and its many districts until you go up the tower The views are not always clear because of the haze but stil worth the visit We went up during the day however some recommend a night visit to see the city lights  If you visit during the day you may consider walking up the hill instead of taking the cable car It is a peaceful walk and mostly shaded but you will need a moderate level of fitness I suggest an 830am start and the 15 hour hike will get you to the tower at opening time at 10am Good to escape the bussle of the city or to fill in a few hours before the shops open
3179,2,The staff kept pushing the passengers into the cable car till we couldnt move our hands to take pictures It was as if we were plainly taking the cable car to the tower but I didnt think that was the case for most of passengers We were not able to move to other side of cable car as we were packed like sardines The view was nice but certainly not the ride
3180,5,The views from the tower are amazing I came here at sunset so got to see sunset over the city and then stayed around for it to get dark to see the city lights I recommend doing this as the views are breathtaking
3181,4,We seem to visit a city tower wherever we visit  this one didnt disappoint Catching the cable car up is the easy way and its a short uphill walk from Myeongdong MRT The view over the city areas to the mountains was very good You can take a walk back down or do part of the city wall from here The garden area around Namsan park is attractive Theres plenty of benches to sit on  refreshments available We went during the day but its open in the evenings
3182,4,I actually enjoyed the view from the deck below the tower better than inside the tower Especially for taking pictures In the tower you have a lot of windows not all that clean so you cant really make a good picture  So if you take the cable cart you have access to some good views not to crowded when we where there So you can get there for free if you walk and not take the cable cart and still have a good view over Seoul  It will take you about 30 min to get up there And if you spend about 1 hour up there not going into the tower you will be done
3183,5,You can see this from the city since it very tall Great view from there to over look the city with all the high building and also the old part of the city We had a good walk from hotel to this tower Good
3184,3,N Seoul Tower is a photo opportunity only No history no culture but some nice photos at night Its worth going to once but I cant imagine a reason to go more than once
3185,5,My first time to visit Seoul and N Tower was my buckelist Must do in Seoul and we will never regret We visited both day and night and both views were just perfect
3186,5,We prefer night visit as the tower looks amazing with its colourful lightings There isnt much to see inside the tower except admiring the city of Seoul in 360 deg Of course you can leave without noticing the Love locks everywhere
3187,5,Our family really enjoyed our visit to the Seoul Tower on the day of our visit there was a reenactment of middle ages sword and pole fighting Once up in the tower we were amazed by wonderful views of Seoul There was also a candy and souvenir shop and a small museum in the tower together with fast food options Truly a wonderful experience though crowded
3188,5,Going up any tower like this will provide the best views of the city You can walk up but is a hard climb Alternatively you can get the cable car up The prices are moderate but you cant miss this There are tours which also take you up this cost much more
3189,4,If you want to see the 360 degree view of seoul this is the place you have to visit I wont mind visit a second time
3190,5,The Tower is at the center of Seoul and provides an excellent view of the city skyscrapersThe platform as well as the tower area provides excellent opportunity and views for photographyA must visit place in Seoul
3191,3,This one you should try to go up on your first time although theres nothing very spectacular it is a mustsee because its one of the most recognisable landmarks of Seoul We took the stairs going up and it was so tiring it is almost 4k steps good things the stairs were really well maintained Took the cable car on the way down
3192,5,I highly recommend to visit the N Seoul Tower at night around 900pm The line wasnt bad at all but keep in mind the ticket booth for the actual tower for viewing closes at 1030pm
3193,3,We took the tram up to the top because it was way too hot and humid to hike up during the day with our five year old While we didnt end up going to the top of the tower this time the views from the hill and base of the tower are still very good We will go back next time we are in Seoul and visit at night
3194,5,It is part of a broad Worldwide tower program  The Great Towers Though a bit hard to get to if by walking quite steep to go by foot there is plenty of other choices A nive combination is walking and riding the cable car
3195,4,Got a entrance package that cost W26000 with 2 entrance tic 2 beer and a popcorn That was the worst pop corn i ever had But the rest was good Not a very fascinating tower with a lot of people fighting to take picture at the window so not much peaceful place for you to get a peaceful high view from top Which I believe is the same in most part of the towel in the world If you do not want to buy a ticket just walk around the towel at the place where the tourist hang the lock Is another nice place also but free Oh the towel has transparent toilet
3196,5,This Namsan park is just behind the hotel we stay It take us 10 minutes walk to the cable car stations You can walk up to the Tower which many local did as morning and evening walk When you reach the tower you shall take the lift up to the tower The views from there able to see Seoul city
3197,5,We went on a Monday evening and so did everyone else The line up was all the way down the road and it took us 15 hours of waiting before we got on the tram Had we known that the path to hike up the mountain only takes 3040 min 24 km we would have hiked it in a heart beat even in the scorching heat On the way down there was also a huge line up so we opted to forfeit our purchased tickets and walked down At first I was very hesitant as it was late out and I wasnt sure how lit the paths were Well this has got to be the best laid out hiking path ever It was paved with stairs and tons of lighting and signs to direct you in the right direction In fact there were still tons of families with young ones in tow that were hiking up the mountain as we were coming down at around 1030pm Theres tons to do and see up there so give your self some time We ate at one of the restaurants which were reasonably priced being on top of a mountain Best advice wear good runners bring water hike up if the line is ridiculously long
3198,3,Guess its one of Seouls mustsee places Was a bit disappointed though It was overcrowded and there is no outside terrace or something which means you cant really take a nice pic Bought tickets with popcorn and Heinekens  liked that option
3199,5,I didnt go up the tower but the walk itself is amazing especially if you go before the sunset You can see the sunset from the hill There are also so many couples and so many locks everywhere so if you have a SO you can lock your locks But other than that theres a watching deck and some cafes on top also the walk down is nice but if you do not like walking there is a service which takes you up I forgot how it was called Either way it is worth a visit A really nice place for a date 
3200,5,Went there after baseball game Note its a long walk The bus takes you there for 1100 WON and worth it The basic ticket is 10000 WON per person Views are great and well worth going
3201,4,A very touristy landmark and crowded over the weekend I was there on a Saturday A very windy area with a good vantage point overlooking the city with basic facilities like car park and public toilets coffee shop convenient stores and souvenir shopping It requires a little bit of climbing but on tarmac so its okay very children friendly area but watch out for cyclists on the way down as they come from behind you keep to the side of the road and hold on to your kids
3202,4,Fun fun fun Long lines on the cable car Thousands of Crazy love locks on fences blocking views Probably dont need to go to the top of The tower
3203,5,We took the cable car up to the tower We opted for beer and popcorn with our admission and sat up in the tower to enjoy the view of Seoul We did it at night to see the lights
3204,4,The Namsan Tower is a great tower which is situated on the Namsan which literally means Southern Mountain It is similar to the observatory towers in Seattle and Toronto and Niagara Falls and other places It offers a great view of the Seoul city scapes Regrettably however most of the time Seoul is so covered in smogboth emanating from China and from its own creation that theoretical visibility does not mean actual visibility Enjoy
3205,5,I love this place Great shopping mall for branded good If you cant afford to shop there but at least come to enjoy the nice restaurant beautiful view of Seoul Tower and Aquarium too
3206,5,Beautiful and wonderful tower in a wonderful place and over Mount And it can be reached by bus and there are many restaurants and cafes and can a good time It is through the tower you can see the city and landmarks
3207,3,I went to Seoul Tower with a group of friends Even though it was a weekday it was quite crowded throughout which gave us some expectations about the view on top of the tower However paying 10000 won to go up is really a waste of money The windows are not well maintained meaning that whatever nice view of the city would go through this dirty filter before it reaches your eyes
3208,5,Fascinating place to visit So much more than just the view which would be worth the visit on its own The walk through the park was very peaceful but very steep in parts If that is a concern the cable car is a less strenuous way of getting to the top
3209,5,We went for the fixed course dinner at the top good food good service table for couple have couch facing the window and fantastic view a wonderful enjoyable evening Best for anniversary or proposing
3210,5,The kids loved the cable car ride to the tower Go on a clear day for the best views of the city Still a lot of steps to walk despite the lift to the top
3211,4,Worth a visit to get some great views of the city both during the day and evening Its easy to get to with the cable car taking you up the hill to the base of the tower Got some great pics from up there
3212,4,Hiking uphill from the subway station to the tram station was daunting in the stifling heat of July There must have been an easier way to get there but we didnt find it The traditional music and dance performances were soso but the view from the top of the tower was nice
3213,4,This is a great way to see all of Seoul in one hit and work out your bearings on a map Cable car ride up was enjoyable 10 mins in between each one going up and down Try and pick a clear day when going up to make it worthwhile like a lot of other people say you dont need to go up the tower we didnt and saw plenty Has a small selection of bars restaurants and shops up there great for a sunset drink
3214,5,The N Seoul Tower especially at night looks amazing Its not expensive to go up in it so you can enjoy hands down to best view of the whole city which is huge
3215,3,If you are in Seoul you should visit it because the view is very good Inconvenient at the top you have many shops so it annoys the ones who want to enjoy the view Very touristic  But again the view is great  Important  remember to see when the last bus is coming because if not youll have to walk all the way down
3216,3,The view up on the tower was quite unsatisfying due to the bad weather Seeing up on the tower doesnt make you feel like being so high up there The only thing that impressed me was the screen at the ceiling of the elevator when going upstairs
3217,5,Rest up before you go as you can challenge the hills up to the tower At the base of the tower you will find food souvenirs and drinks and for the children toys The ride up to the top of the tower is the main attraction and you will be able to see a 360 degree view of Seoul There is a revolving restaurant at the top so you can eat and enjoy the view And now for the children take the elevator to the basement and there is a kiddie corner of rides games and food There is also a little aquarium You can make this a day event
3218,4,It was worth the time to visit  I went on Apr so it was a bit cool at night time  so please prepare your jumper if you come same month 
3219,4,This tower had great views of Seoul and was intetesting to see the beautiful city It didnt seem that high but i guess thsts because you get the cable car first We ended up here at lunch time so it was less crowded which was a good idea Would recommend that
3220,4,I just take a photo from the outside Its very cold here and so windy U can find a lock park in here Bring ur couple
3221,5,My friend and I made the great choice to walk up the hill to the tower instead of riding the cable car The walk really wasnt bad and the weather was pretty temperate for us The night we went it was very clear so we could see really far The views were beautiful and we had a great time
3222,4,Overall  there is an observatory deck free to the public which is quite high up The view from here is good enough and the lovers lock area is also here  worth the visit but only on a clear day  Pros  free area is great  view is fantastic  great atmosphere where the couples place their locks  lots of photo opportunity  Cons  there is a fee 10000 KRW or around 11 CAD to go up to the highest observatory deck higher than the free observatory deck  TIPS  only go on a clear day If there is fine dust or if it is cloudy the view is not as great because of limited visibility  check out the free observatory deck first before buying tickets to go up to the paid observatory deck since the free one might be good enough for you
3223,3,View is great Do not expect much in the observatory Two ways to get to the tower 1 ride the cable car which is very expensive because youll be standing with 49 other people 2 use stairs via Namsan Park
3224,4,We were able to walk to the cable car station and bought tickets for round trip The cable car is just one carriage and packs more than 10 people not sure if there were 20 each time Good to go in the late afternoon so you can hang around at the Observation Tower lots of people had the same idea till sun sets This way we got the daytime panoramic view of the city as well as the night scene We had gone for a Nanta show earlier and bought package deal which came with admission tickets to the tower When we wanted to go back there was quite a long line of people waiting for the cable car
3225,4,The way towards tower is on little height From bus stop it is almost 15 min walk towards tower Buy love locks from market else you need to pay high price at the Tower You will see thousands of love locks there You can print your photo on wood also The city view from this height is awesome
3226,5,The love locks are just normal nothing special We went there during the day and there were a comedy going on on top which was great Transport was convenient too We took the public bus got here during the day spend half day here and sat on the deck with amazing view
3227,5,went during the day but would think that the night would be better a photo is taken of you whilst there and you can select a night or day view which is interesting
3228,3,The tower is unimpressive the climb up is steep and the entrance fee is rather high but once up there it is a great view of the city
3229,5,The N Seoul Tower gives an outstanding panoramic view over SeoulThere are numerous organised trips that can be quite expensive  just get the train right to the tower you dont need a guide
3230,4,I arrived here at night because of the long queues to get in the cable car Wait for almost 2 hours It was packed but still can found good spot for good photos Love the view
3231,4,Its a great place to catch the sunset Just be prepared to walk up quite a number of flight of steps to get up here In fact we walked up multiple slopes and stairs just to get to the cable car station and up to N Seoul tower Come with proper footwear
3232,3,There is nothing special as a visitor about this tower cable car experience was good view from the tower is also good
3233,4,A good place to visit if you are in Seoul which offers some great views of the city Lot of eating options available here You can buy some souvenirs from here
3234,3,We went up with the cable car overall nice view but nothing more Theres the lock your love thing going on there where couple pot locks on practically anything willing to hold it around the tower and promise their love to one another Its nice but nothing too much
3235,5,A mustsee The view of Seoul from the tower is absolutely amazing In the observatory deck there is a souvenir shop full of candy cards mugs etc Theres even a few tables to fill out a postcard and send it back home Once purchased the postcards come with stamps  Now there are a lot of lines involved in this Since I was visiting Namsangol Hanok Village nearby my friends and I decided to do the N Seoul Tower next You can walk from the Village probably around an hour all uphill I decided not to do this after walking halfway up  The first line we encountered was the line to use the gondola to bring us to the top of the hill where the N Seoul Tower is located The line to buy the ticket and get on the gondola was probably an hour  Once we arrived at the N Seoul Tower there was tons of people touring around If youre a couple planning on visit bring an engraved lock There are fences and sculptures lined with locks  The next lineup was the lineup to take the elevator to the top of the Seoul Tower The lineup wasnt too bad probably around 1530 minutes Once inside the conservatory the area was packed with people Note We went around lateafternoon just as the sun was setting The sitting areas were taken up and it was hard to find a good spot to stand by the window for the view However once the sun set the view was beautiful  Once all was said and done there was a line up to go back down the tower and another one to take the gondola back  All in all a great view cool souvenirs and pretty budget friendly
3236,5,It is best at night SPECTACULAR It is a must see You can bring everyone All ages Have a great time everybody Have fun
3237,5,This is a MUST SEE of South Korea Leaving without visiting the Seoul tower is like not coming at all Take a lock with you because locks are really expensive there Eat before going since there are not many options to eat there
3238,4,went there during spring full of people Very nice view and on the way walking up we were caught by the beautiful flowers Many vendor taking picture for you so if u would like to have nice picture pay between 50008000 won and you can have one
3239,4,Ive been there in the evening when the sun was already down and the views are amazing The only downside is that you have to wait a while for me it was an hour between buying the ticket and going up But they tell you that in advance and you can wonder around during that time theres a lot of open space with also good views of the city or have a drink or a meal in one of the cafes there The tower looks amazing in the evening too
3240,3,Did not have the chance to go up the elevator to the viewing deck but the location already gives you quite a good view of the city The number of love locks around the area was mind blowing Locks are attached to fence like structures  multi layered or to tree structures  making them like Christmas trees If you do not bring a lock with you you can buy one right there at the gift shop and attach it to any lock that is already there to symbolize your lasting love to your loved one
3241,5,This place is a MUST SEE Its so beautiful especially at night Waiting for the cable car can be a little discouraging BUT once you get up there it is truly breath taking to look at Seoul from the top Highly recommend this place
3242,5,Went there in evening hours the 360 degrees sight of shiny Seoul is definitely worth every penny to pay for the ticket  Dont miss out photo shoot at the entrance and enjoy the movie in elevator
3243,4,You can go there to see Seoul from the top it is very amazing up there epically when it is cloudy or at the sunset time
3244,4,Must see in korea bit of a wait for cable car but its worth it once et the top great views and exciting timr
3245,5,I had been here many years back but I went there again in this trip  ITS always refreshing to go there and see Seoul from a top
3246,1,Its worth walking up the mountain as you will have a great view over Seoul from the top of the mountain But going up the tower it isnt really worth the price Its crowded and noisy You will not be able to enjoy the beautiful night scenery of Seoul here Rather go to Palgakjung or Han River for that
3247,4,Theres only a handful of days in Korea where its clear out And luckily when my family and I traveled to the N Seoul Tower we happened to go on one of these days Its as expected its tower on top of a hill overlooking a large city So its definitely worth going at least once while in South Korea After youre done with the views theres plenty of restaurants available in the tower and even great views outside of it
3248,4,You get to go on cable car to the top which can be a one way trip or a round trip one way estimated 6 US dollars; round trip estimated 85 US dollars If you buy one way trip you need to return by walking down through a passage where you can enjoy the natural scenery and breathe the fresh air as well You can also bring your partner to lock your love lock a symbolism of your long lasting relationship Ultimately the view on the top is really worth it especially if you watch it during the night
3249,5,Well worth a visit Go early in the morning before the smog haze develops and enjoy the amazing views across Seoul Take the cable car or if feeling energetic its possible to walk up to the tower
3250,3,well i went to tower  end of the the time i just look 360 view which was average  cost is high to pay
3251,4,N seoul tower was nice lovely views from the top Go just before sunset so you can see views in the day during sunset and at night hiwever this is a very crowded time The surrounding food areas were totally overpriced with minimal variety I suggest you eat before you get there Its quite a walk Uphill to get to the tower so wear comfortable shoes
3252,3,Very beautiful place The biggest in Seoul Because of rain it was smog that day I cannot see all the city
3253,5,A one time experience Take the cable car up and down Long waits for cable car and sometimes to get into the city view part of the tower Food and drink pricey up top as you might expect Youll be glad you went but I doubt youll do it again
3254,4,walked up the tower rather than the cable car Great views and view points going up and on the way down At the top there are masses and masses of padlocks with moving words of love and positivity If only the world could be this caring There are plenty of photo opportunities both of the breathtaking views and the colourful padlocks At the tower there are a number of restaurants and gift shops You can buy the padlocks at the tower but obviously at a premium price
3255,5,Nice views However the views from the cable car might be enough and you might not need to go up The cost is not too expensive as well
3256,5,Excellent view of the city Incredibly busy we waited 3040 mins in line to purchase tickets for the cable car Walking is another option but it was too hot for a hike Add another 20 mins to board the cable car and 10 to get to the top of the tower Overall it was still pretty awesome
3257,5,Wanna go to N Seoulyou can try cable car station around myeongdong but in the bad weather it will be closed You can try go another way When arrived in N Seoul Tower you can see love locked around there Go up the tower we can see Seoul 360 You better go in the evening The beautiful city of seoul with glamorous light
3258,4,Be sure to set out enough time for standing in line Copious amounts of people visit this attraction The view is great the windows should just be cleaned from time to time and worth the wait
3259,3,Visited on the evening on August 1st so the temps had cooled down to a tolerable level A few of our group took the stairs up which was a great little workout Highly recommend taking the bus if you dont want to get all sweaty as there are a lot of steps in a steep incline A few members of our group took the bus and had to wait over an hour to get on a very crowded bus The night views were well worth the effort though Be aware of the mosquitoes moths and cicadas as they were all out in force Our entire group chose to walk down to avoid the bus crowds We obviously visited during peak domestic and foreign tourist season
3260,4,Not cheap just for a look but we got the couple package for 21000 won with beer and popcorn so its not too bad you also need to add the cost of the cable car up to the bottom of the tower as well Great view from the top over the entire city that sprawls as far as you can see
3261,3,But my sea bass tasted fishy Not the kind of quality I expected from such an upscale kind of place Other than that though Simply spectacular Period
3262,4,Namsan is a beautiful small mountain in the heart of the city and its tower is above the city giving the visitors an incredible vue But it costs 10 000 won a bit too expensive  But there is too others nice paths inside the forest of the mountain its wildly and safe at the same time I saw butterflies birds and other kind of insects and animal I didnt know I really recommend people to go down the mountain by these paths and not taking the bus
3263,4,Namsan or N seoul tower is 15 minutes at most to myeongdong depending on transport Yu can walk from myeongdong and take the sky train ride the bus or for some which is crazy for me walk all the way to the top Its scenic and beautiful mainly oriented to couples It features restaurants a pagoda and the famous love locks
3264,4,This is accessed via a cable car The wait for the car is quite long When we arrived all at the ticket office had gone for their break Having said that when they returned the queue went down more quickly The charge for the cable car doesnt include the trip up the tower this is an additional cost There are places to eat at the base of the tower The queue to return in the cable car was huge so we decided to walk down the mountain This took about 20 minutes There are some great viewing platforms on the way down
3265,5,It was a very nice and romantic place  We will def come back Best time to go is in the afternoon till night  For couples bring tripod for great shots so you wont need strangers to take shots for you We love this place  it was near our hotel too 
3266,3,You will need to ride their elevator up to the hill to reach the ticket counter The elevator is free You buy a ticket and ride cable car to the Seoul Tower There is a place to sell locks and you can write on it and lock on the fence around the place And theres a lot of people too
3267,4,We took the city loop bus up to the tower The day we went was busy but I have since been told that there is no off peak time even when its misty The views are spectacular You get a sense of the true size of Seoul Its a massive spread out city My only complaint is that everyone touches the class and its hard to avoid the smudges while trying to get a good picture There is a post office box in the tower so for a small fee you can buy a postcard and send to friends When you have had enough of the view you can venture back to the ground level to buy food and drinks Its the usual tourist food but its not too bad If you are with your partner you can then buy a small padlock and place it with thousands of other locks Its a pretty amazing sight and nice to see people getting into the spirit
3268,4,Went in the evening to view the nightline Basically waited in queue behind a whole village takes almost an hour waiting in line to get on a cable car that takes 5 minutes to ascend Had to get tickets to head up to the observatory which was another 30 minute wait View would have been amazing if not for the fog present as it had rained beforehand Descend was more comforting 20 minutes in line and a lot quicker than I had thought villagers were mostly not present
3269,5,Just spectacular You will not see Seoul like this unless you take a helicopter tour which no doubt would cost significantly more than catching the cable car to the tower and paying the extra just 10000w to go up the tower to the observation decks You MUST do this  Wed eaten before heading up and would recommend using the toilet just after youve paid for the cable car We waited about 45 mins through patches of no air con and lovely air con need to be patient Its worth it  The main area at the base of the tower is lovely Despite lots of visitors it feels relaxed and theres space to step back and take it all in Lovely planting and pergolas some of which provide scenic backdrops for photo opportunities Of course plenty of opportunity to buy a padlock personalise and add it to your choice of locations dotted around Tastefully done by the way  On the top observation there are sweet and souvenir shops and opportunity to buy write and post postcards Perfect This area is REALLY busy Once youre done take the stairs down a level Here it is MUCH quieter You learn more from the info quotes on the windows and can buy a drink and sit peacefully taking in the stunning views Its from this level you catch the lift to return to the base of the tower  This really is a must do if youre exploring Seoul and really want to see just how significant sprawling and stunning a city it is
3270,4,N Seoul Tower is famous because of the view Its the best place to see Seoul at night cause its located at uphill and you need to walk around 5minutes from the bus stop to the ground of the tower People also call it as lock tower
3271,5,We wanted to be there early to avoid the crowds so we got to the cable car early There are still a bunch if steps to the Tower proper There is quiet a haze over the city which doesnt make for clear pictures It is a fun and amazing place
3272,4,Theres 2 parts to get to the top If youre coming from ground level the first elevator is free of charge Then you have a choice of paying for the next elevator or  walking up the stairs for free On a hot or humid day or evening I would not recommend the stairs but the option is there The final ascent to the top of the tower does cost you an extra fee though which is where the Teddy Bear Museum was also located The view isnt that exciting just lots of buildings I think thats the only reason to go up to the top as I cant imagine the view of skyscrapers and residential towers would be that exciting from a few metres higher So you could do everything for free if you really wanted to or end up spending around 10000 to 20000 won
3273,3,We went up to see the view from the tower but all we could see was the haze and pollution coming from China to Korea Would have been much better at night to see the lights
3274,2,I was visited this tower on night time when i reached top floor nothing special on this tower Unless u come to this tower with your couple Buy a lock and lock it Thats all Not really good place to visit
3275,4,My partner and I WALKED through the park to see N Seoul Tower and that was a MISTAKE We didnt plan enough in advance to know which subway station to get off at that put us closer to the tram that takes you up So we decided to get off at the closest subway station to the park and hoped to find the tram We didnt and ended up walking the entire way up Be bought the combined ticket which included 2 observation tickets 1 large popcorn and 2 medium drink for 21000 won FANTASTIC DEAL because one observation ticket was 10000 won So we paid 1000 won for our popcorn and drinks Also when purchasing our tickets we were told that the restroom on at the observation deck was out of order so plan accordingly On the observation deck there was plenty of room to sit and enjoy our snack and cool off There was a gift shop coffee bar and treat bar The view of Seoul was hazy of course However N Seoul Tower is a most stop if visiting Seoul
3276,3,Gives you a nice view of Seoul It was our first time to ride a cable car so that was fun but a bit scary for me There were too many visitors both locals and tourists There was a small area for lovelocks just like in Paris Nothing really much to do there except take photos No need to go up the tower really
3277,2,You get there by an elevator The waiting room is not clean it has no air conditioner and they get all people inside So you cant enjoy the view on the way up When you get there you see everything dirty and when you hope to the city before getting in the Tower you dont see a thing because the city is very polluted You have a lot of places to sit down but not clean so you dont enjoy it It could be something so nice
3278,4,Worth a visit to see the park View from tower ok if visibility is good No need to go up tower Namsan park walkingrunning track is a great place for a run
3279,3,Although the views are pretty good the observatory is extremely crowded and its impossible to actually enjoy the skyline
3280,3,We visited in the rain so the view wasnt great But in a clear day it would be awesome Interesting restaurants and lots of love locks  Worth a visit if you are in Seoul 
3281,4,We purchased specified date tickets from Klook ticket discount App Although it was a foggy night and we could not change the date we still dined at Han Cook one floor below the observation floor to wait for the clear of the sky Luckily we did not leave early and the clouds cleared on their own half way through Meanwhile there was a roar of crowd of surprise Therefore we could still admire the fascinating night views of Seoul The buffet at Han Cook offered and included each diner one main dish as well Some main dishes were designed to be shared by two diners My teen children like the main dishes
3282,5,Great view over entire Seoul and a great way to understand how big the city is when planning your sightseeing Take the lift and the cable car from the down town area for some extra fun
3283,4,If you come here during a popular time eg in the late afternoon then be prepared for long lines up and down The cable car as well will have long long lines N Seoul tower offers some gorgeous views of the city around it if you dont want to fight the crowds for a good photo go downstairs to the exit level and youll find the same views but almost no people You can also send a post card from on top of the tower
3284,3,Not best place to visit but gives a good overview of the city  I believe it is nicer to visit wit kids and family
3285,5,We walked up the hill to ride the cable car towards N Seoul Tower Can explore for 12 hours Were there quite late near closing time but still bustling with people especially couples and families Most of the shops are closed My friend and I really enjoyed the HD tunnel from LG So stunning and real
3286,4,We went to Nam San tower because everybody said you had to see Nam San Tower Maybe everybody built it up for me But it was just Ok Its the highest point in Seoul and you get to see the whole city Be prepared to hike We have some awesome pictures from this spot But not sure if it is a MUST see experience
3287,4,Take a few hours after visiting Itaewon or Myeongdong and go up the hill to visit Best time to visit is sunset Expect crowds but great for the family A definite must for your visit
3288,3,We have visited a number of towers in various cities worldwide Unfortunately we didnt think this compared particularly favourably The place was crowded and noisy and it appeared to consist more of numerous retail outlets rather than a tourist attraction Much of the tourist industry was focused on the practice of love padlocks  quite interesting to see chained everywhere but obviously a good opportunity for selling these items  At the top of the tower was noisy with very loud pop music The windows were not totally clear and no local landmarks were indicated The deck one floor below showed some local landmarks but it was not possible to walk all the way round  The cable car offered an efficient service to avoid a hot lengthy claim and it afforded some reasonable views  we managed to get in the front on the way down  The visit was by no means a disaster There were quite good views of the city and it was worth the visit However are less commercialised site and more indications of the local geography would have enhanced our experience
3289,4,This is a nice thing to do at night you can see Seoul it is really beautiful You can either take the bus or walk it is quite a walk but nice to do
3290,5,I arrived quite late there 2130  2200 Was worth to see it at night amazing 360 view of seoul Unfortunatly the viewing decks are closed with glass which makes it difficult for pictures
3291,3,If you can go on a clear day then make the trip otherwise dont worry On the top you can do a full circle to see the surroundings and the view is lovely but too often theres bad visibility Theres the usual opportunities to buy souvenirs candy coffee on several floors
3292,4,N Seoul tower was fun Great views as expected Easy trip up there Didnt take long to get up and back Not crowded and clean like everything else in Korea
3293,2,Its quite short and there was nothing much interesting to see inside nor it has a nice view Quite disappointed
3294,4,Well worth a visit with great 360 views of Seoul distances to many major citys on the viewing Windows  the area around the tower is also good with actors dressed in traditional costumes The hop on hop off bus stops at the tower For me this was one of the better city tower viewing experiences
3295,5,I really liked this I went with my mum and it was a very nice day out This was one of the highlights of my trip to Seoul as the cable car was a really fun experience Make sure to bring a unique padlock The tower itself was interest and very peaceful I liked how on the windows it told you which direction and the distance certain countries are from each window pane The show was also decent
3296,5,Very romantic place I think it was definitely worth a visit Pretty good eats below the building too
3297,4,Spectacular view of the Seoul city from top of the tower  It takes less than 25 second to reach the top with elevator  Lots of soveniour shop on top oc the tower  Must visit place when you are in Seoul
3298,3,A short journey up up up on the hilly top before arriving to the platform to go all the way up to the observatory Once there awaits a beautiful scenery if the weather is clear or just fog and nothing but smog Better be here at night as its more beautiful scenery Just avoid tourist time as its very noisy and overcrowded
3299,5,Love locket to express your love I think it would b better to bring ur own lock they sell the lock from 750015000won can b expensive the tower has 5 levels each level has different of view From tower level 1 fee will apply but if u only stay downstairs u still can see lots of stuff view and nice food
3300,5,worthwhile going up the tower during sunset and or evening as there is stunning view of Seoul from the tower There are several restaurants if you wish to have a meal there
3301,4,Went here on a hot hazy day Took the subway from Insadong and walked 15 minutes up to the Cable car worth every penny on a day like this  The tower itself is expensive the restaurants more so But we had a great time even though fog and smog covered some of our view  Bathrooms were being renovated so make sure you go before you enter the tower  Plaza was a typical tourist trap but crowd pleasing martial arts and traditional music demonstrations art installations and the local park made for a nice promenade  Leave a lock for the love of your life if you feel so inclined
3302,4,Seoul at night is beautiful Go to the observation deck to get the full view of seoul at night I suggest going earlier like 6 or 7pm since there are a lot of people waiting for the cable car or if you dont like to wait or use the cable car go walk up the tower But its better to take the cable car going up and walk down Walking down wont be as difficult plus youll get to appreciate the walk down the mountain too
3303,5,either walk up or take the cable there are 2 levels 1 takes u to the base then lift up to the top well worth it 
3304,4,A nice look a bit foggy of the city the Hangang river and the closer neighborhood There is a small tourist shop for small souvenirs one can buy and send a postcard with a special stamp of the tower At our arrival before entering the tower at the squarethere was a local folklore show with musical accompaniment
3305,4,We went with the last cable car up at night and avoided the crowds and lines but we could only come back by bus or 20min walk which was very convenient bus took less than 10min to get to Myeongdong Beautiful view at night however we missed to go into the tower as the last entrance is at 1030pm and the area closes at 11pm Plenty of people up after 11pm although dark and in the middle of a national park it feels safe and we enjoyed it
3306,5,I went there during the night I spent at least 2 hours to queue the cables bought the ticket n to get to the tower There are different options to get to the tower ie Including good or popcorn I chose the plain one It s a very popular place for both tourist n local people The couples alyways go for a date to out their lock in The view is really beautiful You can walk via the pacific hotel There are lot of cartoon characters around the suburb
3307,4,Enjoyed the performance at the base Love the idea of selling the ticket to tower top with popcorn and drinks Spend good 20minutes enjoying the view Complete the experience with a coffee before continuing your trip
3308,5,The experience to Seoul Tower was memorable Parking in the area surrounding the cable car station was pretty hectic so be prepared to find alternate parking and walk to the cable car station The cable car ride up was pretty quick however there was quite a long line to get on it Once at the top the Locks of Love was an interesting feature and then seeing the Seoul Tower was unforgettable Lots to see and do even before entering the Seoul Tower and definitely worth paying to go all the way up to the obsevation deck
3309,5,The stairs are tough but a good workouf Take your time to explore the park around the tower Lots of things to do overhere
3310,3,Nothing interesting but offers good view of Seoul The price is 8500 won for the round trip cablr car
3311,4,Here you can see great view of seoul city I prefer to visit at sunset time and if you are photographer take your tripod with you Also use the cable car its lovely you can take round trip or single trip but for single trip you will walk till you reaching the main road Enjoy it and dont miss it
3312,5,queue for cable car is usually long next option besides trekking uphill is bus you can take bus here from many tourist place like insadongmyeongdong etc the best time to visit namsan tower is 5pm before sunset fantastic view stay here until night
3313,5,Me and my group of friends came here and it was great There was an amazing view of the city and we just simply loved it Its a bit of work getting to the top thoughas you need to walk up a steep hillbut its totally worth it At the top theres a cute little post office where you can send postcardsand I thought it was really cool There were quite a lot of couples therewhich explains why they sold a lot of lovethemed merchandiseMy boyfriend and I bought these adorable key rings Ill definitely be coming back during my next visit to Seoul
3314,5,when we arrived at the top of N Seoul tower we see the sunset everybody was ready with camera  video to capture the sunset so awesome the distance between n seoul tower to a car park about 30 minutes walk  but the scenery is very fantasticyou must try it
3315,2,You can get very nice views without going to the top of the tower The queue for leaving the tower can be even longer that the one to get in Moreover if you go by night it the reflection of the indoor lights makes really difficult to get any picture
3316,4,Enjoyed a great view from the tower and included posting postcards from here The elevator runs smoothly and all staff are more than helpful Great on a fine visibility day
3317,5,That was amazing time specially in the night  i suggest if u going to South Koreadont miss Seoul Tower 
3318,2,     so many tourists groups a lot of trash and graffiti and noisy  especially the CVS near the bus station trash everywhere and pretty dirty  would be much better if less people go not too much to see actually only souvenir store some restaurant that is it you do not need to go up to the towel to see the whole view Easy to go by bus I would not to go again a place just visit once and it is enough
3319,4,The views of Seoul from the top of the tower are spectacular It costs 10000 won to travel to the top and there are numerous places to get snacks at the tower as well as a restaurant we didnt use If you take the public bus it will take you near the base of tower At the base of of the tower there are picturesque views and many settings that are used for Kdrama that my wife was familiar with If you are with your lover and so inclined bring a lock And dont forget your camera If you benefited from this review please click the helpful button
3320,5,I recommended to do it during the night because the view of seoul is just amazing  you can discover this part of Seoul that you cant see in general  Just do it by walk  its a little bit long but at the end youre happy
3321,4,You have to go to the top to admire the city view Go for dinner at one of the restaurants and you can go to the top for free If you love seeing the city from high up it is a must see
3322,5,I visit Seoul tower and one of interesting thing same as India i saw in India peoples tied a trade on tree and wish i in Seoul Tower young boys and girls lock a locker and wish and keep the keys
3323,5,Dont miss the chance to visit one of the landmarks in Seoul and catch a view of the city from above the N Seoul Tower If its not a rainy or foggy day you should definitely go up the tower Otherwise youll still have picture perfect photos without going up Plus you get a chance to leave your own love lock
3324,5,Oh how beautiful is the view Most importantly the TV series My Love from the Star all the romantic scenes were taken from here It was so fun to sit on the same chair where the main characters satable to experience the same viewhow wonderful
3325,3,Long queues to go up by cable car and enter the observatory and back marred the experience for us I would suggest coming on weekday mornings when there wouldnt be so many people Or you could come in the evening and see the Seoul skyline change from day to night Do note that as of now there are no restrooms on the observatory levels so if youre planning to stay there for a while keep that in mind The view itself was fantastic
3326,5,Panoramic views but do not choose a misty dull or rainy day Shuttle bus for the less energetic but trails go up from the shopping district of Myeongdong for those who want to trek
3327,5,Was able to visit the tower during the eveningnight then again during the day I enjoyed both visits though I enjoyed the night views a bit more Still well worth the visits And it was walking distance back to our hotel
3328,5,OK so you are in Seoul thats awesome And if you are deciding if you should visit this place then think no more and just do it I went there during night time and what a view you get its very similar to the view you get from on top of the eiffel tower There are lots of stores to buy merchant and food so dont worry about eating I suggest you either catch a bus or taxi to the nearest point and walking up as it only takes 20mins If you cant be bothered then you can wait for the cable ride but be warned that you might have to wait for 1 2 hours
3329,4,You can take the cable car bus or walk up to the hill where the tower is located If the day is clear from pollution you have great views to all direction from under the tower So we didnt go up to the tower because the view was amazing enough from the hill For couples There are plenty of places where to put a lock with your names or even a picture of you
3330,3,Seoul N tower is just other tower where you can see the view of the city When we came it was drizzling and sky was cloudy and so we could not see much in my view eventhoug it was a pefect sunny day the view was ok nothing special But they were very creative with the padlocks that visitors put on the fence and places that create interesting decorations
3331,4,Our family really enjoyed going to Seoul Tower The cable car ride was a fun experience in itself although they definitely crowd people in it Theres also no AC so if you are hot andor claustrophobic you may just want to walk up the mountain trail Once at the top there are shops and cafes You can also buy a lock to write your name on and hang on one of the many fences railings trees etc that are around the park The tower itself had a fun elevator ride with a video that plays as you ascend and descend The views were great even for a smoggy afternoon We spent the 12000 won for a souvenir photo because why not If you happen to go when its not insanely hot or rainy the park at the base of the tower is a really nice area to picnic jog or just people watch
3332,4,It is a beautiful place to spend time with your lover We watched the sunset an took photos of the night of Seoul city  There are public eye transport to and from the N Seoul Tower But the waiting time for bus is about 20 mins
3333,4,The view from the tower is excellent This is one high ground area every tourist should visit The best way to get here is to walk through the park Taking a tourist bus to this location spoils the ambiance
3334,5,Im sure that people focus on the view from the top tower which is spectacular especially at night The trip up the cable car is awesome The grounds around the bottom of the tower are very pretty and offer similar views without the dirty glass view from the top Its fun to look around at all the padlocks which is creating fun and interesting shapes This is the thing The tower its self viewed from a distance and up close looking up at it is stunning The added bonus for us was the half mile walk up from the subway which was beautiful offered great views and some great restaurants along the way
3335,5,N seoul tower vert recomended place for tourist to take picture  experience ride by cable car to the top of N seoul tower
3336,4,This is a must visit to me it was very cold in the winter seasonwindy but we had fun just hang out at the tower and bought a package that comes with pop corns and drinks  We took a cable car as it was quite late if we walked from Namsan ParkThere were lots of people with family and also couples there to enjoy the view from above
3337,3,It is a nice place to visit nothing out of the ordinary mostly if you compare it with other of its kind but it is definitely worth going as it is a landmark of seoul  You get a very nice view of the city if is a nice day if it is a rainy or cloudy day it is not worth to go at all since you wont be able to se anything  The entrance fee is very good price and it includes drinks and pop corn for 21000 hkd for 2 person  note that the pop corn and drinks is one big of each to be shared with the 2 persons   Have in mind that from the subway station myeongdong exit 3 there is a free shuttel that takes you to the entrance of the cable car that takes to the tower
3338,3,Its not that tall but you can see the city and you need to climb a lot of stairs just to get to this tower as it is located in a hill
3339,3,If u r in a relationship this place is recommended for you The place can bring great memorable with the beautiful scenery  the Couple Lock that hold you together However if u r single like me u still can enjoyed the place with family or friends The lock is available for everyone  every kind of wishes
3340,5,A nice walk up from Myeong Dong about 40 mins slow pace Lovely restaurant half way as well as a gym At the top they are building a mall with restaurants a mini zoo and a really cool 3D viewing platform Even on a good day views are clouded with pollution but its very green and pretty up there Often cultural exhibitions from 34
3341,5,We spent the best part of a day walking up to the N Tower enjoying the free cultural experiences that were offered at the base of the tower and then the fabulous unrushed set priced meal whilst taking in the amazing views over Seoul and beyond Lunch prices are considerably cheaper than the evening meal which made this an affordable and very special treat
3342,5,My daughter was looking forward to see this place and it did not disappoint We walked up instead of taking the cable car It was a good walk The view is great
3343,4,Im in two minds about N Seoul Tower; while the actual location is really quite cool the tower experience itself was a tad underwhelming By the time you get to the tower proper you are already high above the city and going up to the observation deck does not really add to the overall experience  If I go again I would stick to the restaurants on the main concourse for a beer or a snack even the Family Mart for a cold Hite and a bag of Kimchi potato chips at one of the picnic tables is quite OK and forego the observation deck part  Access is via a short but steep walk from the bus parking lot and takes 15 minutes or so; should be no problem unless you have mobility issues There is no direct access to the concourse at the tower itself by bus or taxi As always in Korea there are lots of immaculate washrooms close by
3344,1,I have been to the tower in Osaka Tokyo Shanghai Macau Hong Kong this made us to wait the longest  First you ll have to wait 30mins to BUY a cable car ticket then another 30mins to get on the cable car the cable car a box for at least 30 standing people   somehow the cable car travel was short Just able 5mins But its not the end  We will have to walk to the top of a small hill  line up for buying tower ticket again which is short  10mins I guess then we start the 20mins waiting for getting up into  waiting line for the elevator  there is only one elevator operating  So another 15mins for line to get on the elevator  Even going back down We waited 15mins in the tower and 30mins for the cable car  Make a cal 2 hours plus spent just on waiting 
3345,3,Fun for a little outing Some restaurants and shops The view is neat from the tower but overall nothing mind blowing Still this is a must do for any visitor or resident of Seoul It is a good romantic spot so bring a padlock to place on the designated trees by the tower
3346,3,I thought Id walk up vs take the cable car  Its quite a hike up the many many stairs so get ready for some exercise  But there are these mango popsicles you can get at the top so that helps 
3347,5,Definitely a must see if in the core Seoul area We were excited to take the cable car up and leave our love locks
3348,4,There are three option to go to the top of mountain 1cable car 2bus no 2 5 3 walkhike approx 1400m climb  If you have already been in a cable car I reckon take the track Because on the way up there are couple of nice place to see and photo island where you can take photos of city skyline The track will take approx 3040 mins Wear comfortable clothes and trainers and in case take an umbrella as rainy season Both views are good the day and night  But if you dont have time and only can visit one time then please go around 6pm so you can see the city skyline at night too as Sun sets at 8pm To go to the observatory the ticket is 10k won and you need to wait like 30 mins or more on weekends There are plenty to facilities for snacks and food up there
3349,4,My husband and I enjoyed the view at the top of N Tower  I was stunned to see city of Seoul at night  Weve used a telescope and saw the buildings clearly from afar  In the end  we felt so attached with the place and promised to come back very soon
3350,5,It is a wonderful experience to watch the city from the tower top it has small shopping area and you can look for memento and giftsthe sky scrapers of Seoul the river and the lush greenery are all a sight to see For those looking for a sight seeing holiday Seoul could be an option
3351,5,It was so nice to reach to the top of the tower i recommend you go at night to see the view It was much more exciting I bought the ticket from TravoAsia just search it online or mobile app they offer better discount They seems focus on Korea and JP only at the moment Anyway i believe its worth to check out Good Luck
3352,5,It was a cold winters night in Seoul and after an evening out walking through the street markets also a lot of fun the food we thought that we may as well go and check out the tower There is a gondola ride you can take to get up the hill which has some pretty awesome views all by itself At the top there are a few stores and some neat old buildings The whole place has a really magical feeling to it The lighting was beautiful and looking back out over the city was just breathtaking The view from the tower was even better and a tub of popcorn was included in the ticket price  The perfect way to cap off a really great night in Seoul
3353,4,Well worth the effort  panoramic views over Seoul Reasonably priced mementos Night or day view  both quite spectacular
3354,5,N Seoul Tower or Namsan Tower is a must destination for lovers due to their famous love locks similar with those in France Though these are not the only one that attracts every tourist and locals alike It gives you the opportunity to have a glimpse of Seoul Being in the peak the observatory of the tower would definitely give you a scenery to remember
3355,5,So many things to do There are a lot of restaurants so many angles to see the city and if you go lower to the park there are lots of places to exercise chill see It is impossible to do all in just one visit
3356,5,After a lot of stairs and many hills you finally reach the top of Seoul tower The view is breathtaking You can see all of Seoul Make sure to bring a lock so that you can leave A message on it and place it on one of the fences
3357,5,Its a food place to check out the panorama view of seoul city from the top Lots of good food available there and the hike is surreal
3358,4,1 nice place to visit with love ones but go there during off peak period as there were too many people during summer 2 another thing to highlight is the car park  there is not enough of parking lots 3 signage of newadditional tourist highlight if any so that we can look out for it when we are at N Seoul Tower 4 overall a nice experience
3359,5,The tower sits right inside of Namsan Park which is beautiful Getting to the top can be interesting After a few miscalculations we wound up taking the stairs Dont take the stairs if you are not ready for a good hike The tower is 1650 meters from the bottom of the stairs The ascent is about 3040 stories I would probably recommend the cable car which can be accessed through the Myeandong subway exit or you can take a city bus and get dropped off at the cable car station The tower gives a great view of Seoul and really shows you how large the city is It cost about 10000 won to go up
3360,3,Its a nice walk up to the cable cars which will take you to the tower Its very crowded up the top and you have to pay to go up to the observatory extra to the cable car ticket There is a bit to do up there though so highly recommend visiting to see how vast Seoul is Go during the day and at night
3361,4,Youll have the opportunity to see the city from above The elevator was really fast Good photo opportunity there although it is a bit crowded
3362,4,very high It has lift facility as well along with stairs It needs 40 mins to go to top from stairs You can enjoy nice view of city Very high
3363,3,The best part about this was getting to the base of the tower and soaking up the romantic atmosphere The love locks are quite a spectacle added to by the love seats There is a whole new entertainment complex with 3D display LED tunnel and photo pith with the stars Quite kitsch and touristy but good for families and young couples to explore Going up the tower was a quick elevator ride distracted by music and overhead movie The tower observation deck itself is sparse populated with money making sweet shops and touristy stuff The views are limited due to foggy misty pollution Go downstairs where there are better explanations of the views before taking elevator back down This whole part can be skipped as views are goodnight enough from base of the tower  Best thing about it is the people watching
3364,3,Easy to find walking route from Myeongdong Was quite hot when we went at 2pm Bring your own locks of you dont want to pay 8000won onwards to commemorate your visit
3365,4,Nice view but a bit folky during our visited on June 20 Love Padlock can found along the way upstairs that represent commitment and love between two people
3366,4,I climbed til the tower through the stairs as a goal You can use the cable car too to go up but when u go by yourself and with energy and time to go through the stairs is a good excercise with the opportunity to have an amazing view from the city without mirrors The best is to go during the sunset it is so beautiful You can buy drinks before going up
3367,5,We arrived here on a sunny day thus the scenery from the tower was really clear We had coffee at the cafe on the observatory level and spent time admiring Seoul from birds eye
3368,3,We took the cable car up and walked down I wouldnt recommend walking up unless you were really fit The cable car was busy and crowded and if youre a bit claustrophobic like me you just hold your breath for the duration of the trip Its a very popular tourist place with great views of the city But once youve done it youve done it and you dont have to do it again
3369,5,The place gives you the vantage point view of the city Great photo opportunity especially near the gardens and the love locks area
3370,5,Must see place the view is breathtaking also the park is amazing the view is a must see The restaurants are all good This is an amazing place
3371,3,There is distance going there so if there are children n elderly might need to take cab there  Cable car ticket reasonable Viewscenery are awesome Fresh air Overall good
3372,5,This is truly an important part of Seouls personality and history but honestly you cant beat the view from the top If you want to really understand the size and layout of this city get yourself up to the top of the tower The cable car goign up in an excellent choice but walking takes about 45 minutes at a slow pace  just head to jimjilbang after to clean up and youve got the perfect day Make sure you try and see the performers at the top doing weapons displays and traditional music  dance Its free in the open courtyard and fun to watch with some popcorn from near the elevator 
3373,4,You can walk take the cable car or a shuttle bus to reach the top of the mountain on which Seoul Tower was erected Its often hazy but the views are nevertheless worth the climb Buy a love lock and put it on the railings on the viewing platforms like thousands of visitors before The observation deck of the Tower can be accessed for a fee
3374,5,You should go this with your lover not just firends at the night time you can see fantastic night view
3375,4,The views from the tower are good but I found that the journey to the tower was more interesting There are buses that take you to the tower but I caught the cable car to get up You then pass by the locks of love on which people write messages of love Once you get to the top I found that you can walk around the tower very quickly A package deal can be bought so that you can go to the Alive Museum which is fun if you have two or more people  If you want to buy a souvenir my advice is to purchase it from the gift shop downstairs because items are cheaper than the shop in the tower I guess it costs money to get the items up to the top I got off a the Chungmuro subway station and walked up to the cable car
3376,4,Extremely crowded on weekend nights as it is a popular dating spot for local couples Waiting time for the cable car was 40 min at around 2200 on a Saturday night But the view on the illuminated city was worth it
3377,3,Perhaps the cloudy June day dampened the experience for us but we made the most of our time We took the cable car and spent some time with the lovers locks on top We also took the combo ticket to the top of the tower which was an overpriced experience particularly given the overcast day Next time might suggest cable car up and walk down
3378,5,The Seoul Tower is a nice attraction of Seoul The ticket costs around 10 dollars and the view of the entire cityis amazing
3379,4,A good view of the city from here You can get the cable car and then walk to the tower There are many attractions one of which is the LOCKS OF LOVE were people hang locks as a teen of their eternal love Many souvenir shops selling the locks
3380,5,A pretty place to visit Take a picture of the numerous locks  it looks like Christmas Trees with colorful decors I heard the Burgers there is good but did not have time to check it out Maybe next visit will do that
3381,4,Namsan tower is a very beautiful place to visit at night especially for couple you will be impressed with the scenery we can see seoul city view from the top of the tower You can put a lock love in a place that has been provided a very romantic place and suitable for taking photos If you are korea drama addicted you must be love this place Its good for you do not until late at night around 10 pm there are no public bus but you can use the cable car with a very long queue You can visit the website korea tourism organization to get a discounted admission
3382,3,visited seoul tower at night time as its my only free time though paying less for entrance for night time the view from the top would be better appreciated in the daytime the cable car is too crowded i hope they make one for smaller groups also and not just lump all tourist at one go waiting time is reasonable the place is super clean and nice place to have photos taken  
3383,4,I was here during the weekend and there were folk dances and sings very impressive for foreigners I saw samurai dances Ive listened the famous Arirang song
3384,5,If you want to see great views of Seoul Seoul Tower is a MUST to go attraction Standing proudly above the city it offers breathtaking panoramic views of the City It gets a bit chilly in the evening there due to mountains hight so better have hoodie or jacket with you 
3385,1,Went up by the cable car and waited for at least 30min for each trip so spent at least 60mins in total Nothing to see and the love locks idea is silly  Impressed that the local people used the park for exercising Its looks tough o walk up so many fleets of stairs
3386,5,It lays in Namsan Hill with spectacular view of Seoul city Wish to see visit it again at night  Theres a place for love locks where couple can buy locks and write their names on it and lock it on fences or provided public fixture to wish love endurance and happiness as so they believe  Theres a cafe and souvenir shop so if you tired of walking up you can take a rest for a while Probably because I was so excited I did not feel exhausted Just want to maximize my time before the travel ended since its only short visit  Next time will bring my family to pay a visit again
3387,1,Very dirt window of tower When you look for night view Indoor lighting is brighten than outside as there is a souvenir shop You cant really to enjoy view Besides take long queue for cable car If you travel with baby and stroller The staff only let mother and baby to take elevator and father to queue in separate line Staff cannot speaks in English for explanation It is really poor service
3388,3,The cable car ride to the top is fairly short but I enjoyed it I always do though I enjoyed traveling over the heavily treed park and raising higher over the city At the top it is a bit of a climb up stairs to the tower but I took my time and took photos of the millions of love locks attached to fences  structures made for the purpose There are plenty of over priced locks for sale too I suggest if you want to put a lock there take your own then it will be different from all the others Maybe They have a good idea for the elevator lift to the top of the tower something a little different but I wont spoil it by telling you There are the usual shops and restaurants At the base of the tower around the other side is a Starbucks but it is a little hard to find A short walk downhill to a nice bus stop with a small convenience store and plenty of seating and you can catch a but to another part of town to explore
3389,5,Generally too touristy but if youre lucky you can get in when its quiet and enjoy some performances Even at the bottom you have some great views of Seoul so dont feel like you need to go all the way to the observatory deck to have a view  I usually walk down to Myeongdong area from the Cable Car entrance via the horizontal elevator Can do the same going up if you want to save on taxi fare
3390,5,Seoul is amazing People are so kind and respectful on top of that it is very safe Getting up to the Tower was a fun experience Everywhere we went people were friendly kind helpful and loved showing us around
3391,5,Was great Awesome views But its worth it the money for the cable car Its a steep hike up so its hard if you arent use to walking a long way
3392,5,It is very beautiful place The view of the city is quite breathtaking They have 360 degrees glass walls offering a good view however the inside is very brightly lit so good luck taking any bird eye photos in the night However I presume it would be good beforeduring sunset The lovelocks area is also quite good Overall recommended place
3393,3,It looks good till the time you reach the top The excitement in the cable car and the temple before the entry is quite dramatic and raises your expectation But once you are on the top and with the stunning view of the city  is totally spoilt with the bright neon light and absolutely not possible to take any picture Its a total waste if you plan to visit the place to take some good picture This is in the evening  I am not sure what happens in the day time though
3394,4,by day its just a tall tower by night its lighted up and so can we viewed from far away you can either take the cable car or public bus to go up the fill for us we took bus 2 in front of grand ambassador seoul hotel you can use your tmoney card to pay for the ride most famous would be the thousands of locks which couples write notes on and then locked them on the structures provided view from the top is also spectacular good for our photographers friends there are restaurants up there but during our trip as we were there late around 930pm most of the restaurants are closed if you want to view from the observatory you need to pay an entrance fee
3395,5,Take busor gondola from mingdong to the peak and must go the top of tower for great view but the museum not worth money even if they come with the set ticket  Btw if you want you could buy the locker form vendor to lock on the wall would be interesting finding next time  we did last year and its take us 45 mins to find it how lucky we are  and last but not least better go the afternoon one hour before sunset enjoy the view from different three
3396,3,A friend and I were in Itaewon and randomly decided to walk up to Seoul Tower Once we reached the Grand Hyatt we cut through the park and followed the signspathssteps to the paved bus lanes and walked the remainder of the way up  Making it to the top and seeing the view was well worth the effort Theres restaurants shopping and plenty of snacks to be purchased once you make it to the tower If you want to go into the spire you have to come out of pocket  We decided to take a cable car down the opposite side of the mountain and cabbed it back to Itaewon later that evening  Great experience but I cant say its something Id do often
3397,4,An usual tower you find in any modern city but its worth visiting as you are already in SeoulYou may walk up hill to the tower or ride a cable carpreferred walkingDo not buy the photo sold on the gateits costly and umworthyBeautiful scenes around including skyscrapers Take a few photogrph from top
3398,4,They manage to keep visitors to que in line and crowds move smoothly even though there were thousands of vistors coming through out the day The souvenirs offered were affordable nice and have variety of selection Those who have kneejoint problems are not advise to visit this place as you need to walk up the hill which is quite high for an average person to reach the tower entrance
3399,3,Its a very steep walk up the hill to the tower but if you can afford the 90 minute wait you can take the aerial cable car Give the tower a miss and explore the delights of the extensive parklands as you stroll back down to the city
3400,4,WE took the cable car in the evening so as to catch the sunset view it was a bit hazy so we called off going up the tower nevertheless at the foot of the tower you still get a pretty good view of the city the restaurants were also reasonably priced so we ate there We had no problem hailing a taxi on the way down as our initial fear was that there were too many tourists like us who went there on our own
3401,5,We can see a whole view of Seoul Especially at night It is also a nice place for a couple visiting for a better relation
3402,4,A day trip exploring seoul took us to the tower and many palaces Recommended the lifts in the tower lead to a good view without much walking
3403,4,Great views but super crowded on the weekends so if you go then plan to stand in line for up to 45 minutes in each directions on the tram and again for the elevator Buy a lock to add your love link to the massive display Nice little restaurant and bar at the top if you want to linger
3404,4,i went there at spring time and you can see amazing cherry blossom everywherethey also have little tulips garden that not to be missedmaybe the only thing that matter is too crowded of buses that park
3405,4,It cost about 22000 won to go on top of the tower and it comes with free drink n big size popcorn They offers few packages tower tour There will be a mini studio for photo session at the entrance u can buy ur photo 1pc at 12k won and 2pcs for 15k won They have 3 michelin star restaurant but u have to booking online to dine in Theres no much different of panoramic view from the bottom and top of the tower Countless of love lock hanging on the wall of a terrace attached to the tower You can buy the love lock from souvenir shop but its very expensive We get to the tower by bus It was heavy rain and windy so they closed the cable car and the hiking trail as well Nothing much we can do it was too cold and raining Maybe summer is the best time to visit N tower
3406,3,Getting on the tower requires either robust legs vehicular transport paying for and squeezing inside a cable car  Atop the tower you have to pay to get on the observation deck and worse its nothing much to see on a cloudy day
3407,5,a very romantic place in seoul one of the highest place in the city lovelocks are the best perfect for picture takings and breathless views awesome seoul tower
3408,5,Just to remind please get prepare to get your self fit b4 visit Kindly wear good sport shoes   There are many alternatives way to climb up to towerby bus ramainya orghiking for sure  Try to buy tower ticket using promotion korea tourism might be a lot of discounthappy visiting
3409,5,One can have fantastic views of Seoul from N Seoul tower on a sunny day and night It is located on the top of the mountain
3410,5,The view is awesome Nice gift shop and restaurants to spend a little money There is more than just going up in the tower but the view from the observation deck is breathtaking
3411,4,Our itinerary was tailored to our preferences with my friend suggestions at South KoreaI think its more beautiful in the evening
3412,4,We went twice once in evening the last in afternoon All are awesome The tower is very crowded it is difficult to take a photo in there The view is amazing and the air is natural
3413,4,It was one of my favorite moments We were lucky the weather was perfect Not too cold and not too hot Good place with family with friends or even solo
3414,5,That place was amazing and great atmosphere We loved taking telephreak up to the tower The area up was awesome the coffee shops there are lovely and also the food shops I give them two thumbs up You will find the 3D monitor which was a great experience we saw the show two times  Locks of love  loved
3415,5,I have seen so many K Dramas that mentioned this place or showed it that I just had to go and see it myself Yhe place is truly amazing Some posted on my Facebook page that those were beautiful flowers when they saw the picture I posted of the monument of love locks You will have judge for yourself Sorry Im all over the pictures I like taking selfies Note its not just for young people but families and especially older folks and its wheelchair accessible as well You dont have to climb the mountain to get up there Next time I go I will go up on the cable car and come down walking Beware there are a lot of stairs
3416,4,We visited this place in the night It is open till 1030 PM We didnt get a chance to go up to the observatory as it was extremely crowded But all other spots at N Seoul Tower are beautiful and the view of the city from the top is beautifulThere are a couple of restaurants on top You can trek one way and take the cable car the other way
3417,5,Great views atop this tower There is also a candy store and they have signage on the windows indicating how far different cities are Fun and entertaining
3418,3,My visit to the tower was pleasant enough though the waiting time to get to the tower was quite long I enjoyed the opportunity to have photos taken in traditional garb albeit overpriced but overall it was not a very exciting tour
3419,4,We saw it from a distance and as we got closer the sheer grandeur of it became apparent It is an epic structure and worth seeing if you are in the area I love super structures and I am amazed by the architecture The surrounding area is very nice and its worth a trip if you have the time
3420,5,Morning time is rhe best time to see the N tower  It shows all seoul  And while you there you can try some of the perfect options they offer  there is a wood laser machine that print picture on a peace of wood You can take a picture by your self over tgere or by the help of the other people  but i recomend that you use an old picture you like the most  The prices not that much There is also an italian resturant Thire pizza is a must try
3421,3,If you have been to other tall buildings like 101 in Taiwan former World Trade Center in New York etc there is nothing really fantastic about the Seoul Tower What is cute are the love keys that you will see in the garden just before you go up the elevator to the view deck
3422,4,I think this place is special for couple who wants to leave a love padlock in that place Its not that high but good enough to see the whole Seoul I think its a nice place to just drop by for some coffee Me and my husband went up to the Tower and ate at N grill restaurant The food was expensive but delicious We did spend a romantic dinner there
3423,4,Was scared of the tower but the view was amazing you can really see soul the blue house and so many areas its breath taken when you get to the top scary too so many locks that are let by lovers and people who just visit its a place you have to see for yourself its worth it
3424,5,Its a good place to visit awesome view romantic place and the cable car ride was not that good as it was a bit crowdy Comfortable shoes should be worn as lot of walking is needed It is worth it to visit this place
3425,3,Location Bus  There is a shuttle bus from few subway station Myeong dong station is one of it that takes you all the way up to N Seoul Tower  Cable car  walk from Myeong dong shopping street follow the road sign along the way to the cable car station Takes ard 15 mins walk Cable car takes ard 10 mins ride up to N Seoul Tower You can also take the shuttle bus from Myeong Dong subway station to the cable car  Environment High up at Namsan hill overlooking Seoul city This is also the place where the love padlocks is located Originated from Europe but it is very popular here in N Seoul Tower as well Sometimes if you are lucky rave party will be happening at this place  Price Pretty expensive for my liking  FYI You have to pay another entrance fee to go to the top of the N Seoul Tower
3426,4,The tower itself is just oknice views and large gift shop but surrounding area is a nice place to hang out for an hour or so Take the cable car if possible fast and beautiful view
3427,3,A very popular destination in Seoul for local residents A huge number of visitors reach by cable car noticing thousand of thousands of wish locks reflecting popularity of the venue In the cable on the way we can see one part of Seoul by night Various floor and steps amply display colourful locks on treesrailing rather everywhere showing a faith for future and love Spread out are at top and interesting floors in tower resembles like any other tourist city tower Though venue can be covered in 2 hours it has less dramatic element for an overseas tourist
3428,5,Dont miss the road at the base of the mountain that has a walking path Very beautiful and a great escape from the hustle of the city If I had found this earlier in the trip I wouldve gone daily I highly recommend it for anyone who loves nature and exercise and wants to get away from it all I believe it is c all ed Ring Road and it actually has a spongy surface which is easy on the knees for walkers and joggers
3429,5,A must see in Seoul It is also the hight peak in the area It provides an observation deck to see the city It has a variety of stores restaurants and Love Locks Area
3430,4,To reach N Seoul Tower u can use Cable Carits a great experience in this cable car u can also reach by walk or road Enjoy Love Lock point at the exit of cable car Remember to bring ur Lock and Keyis believed that ur love wish get true here Climb up to now reach N Seoul Tower U can buy ticket to of N Seoul Tower observatory view is amazing Lots of entertainment and sovernier shopping at the base of tower This tower is at Mt Namson about 200mts above and one of the high level of Seoul Even if u dont want to go at observatory deckdo visit this place as lots of fun for all family and couple at base as well In Night u can enjoy beautiful LED Lights on N Seoul Tower
3431,3,The Tower was good but not up to expectation You pay for a cable car to get to the Tower Then they charge you again to take an elevator to the top If skies are clear views are spectacular You can see for about 50 miles on a good day Keep in mind smog is an issue and can blur viability Restaurants and trinkets all available As you can imagine this is highly commercialized I recommend doing this at night With city lights more beautiful
3432,5,we walk from grand hotel myeongdong which we are staying It took around 15 min and purchasing the tickets was a breeze We get the package which include a meal at the restaurant there The view are so so but the areas there are very nice
3433,4,We walked from the station all the way to the cable car station You might need to ask for directions a few time as the sign is unbelievable hard to find Since it is an uphill walk be prepare to hydrate yourself  The Seoul Tower cable car is pretty cool but still average  The place is extremely beautiful flowers trees You can also easily find food there The lovers locks is free entry but the Seoul Tower isnt  There are also a lot of places to see if you decided not to go up into the tower Depends of the time available to get the full experiences at least 4 hours is required  There are also traditional dance performance
3434,4,As a tourist its a norm to go visit all sorts of towers Taipei 101 torontos CN tower hong kongs sky 100 etc once to be would be more than enough
3435,4,Not my first time to Namsam Tower but it was my first time walking all the way up there and it was good You get amazing views breathing in fresh air taking pictures It was a long walk though and many stairs so this is definitely not recommended for people with knee issue Remember to bring water if you opt to walk up there
3436,3,You may go N Seoul Tower if you are in Seoul for 34 days visit as going up and down even by trollyshall take at least 12 hours
3437,3,We did this as part of a tour The view is definitely cool from the top but I was able to see comparable if not better views from hiking
3438,5,We took the bus 05 from Myeongdong to Namsam Tower It was a loooooong tiring uphill walk to the tower but it was worth it
3439,3,It was a lovely view The cable car views were better than the tower  The lines were long every step of the way We went at night  The rest restaurants were all closed by the time We got down from the tower around 930 Thank God we opted for the popcorn and beer option or we would have starved  If youve seen towers in other cities this was not one of the best  You couldnt take very good pictures inside at night because of the glare  Finding an affordable taxi at the cable car base was very difficult at 1030 at night
3440,5,Its about 8 return ticket on the cable car to the top and you dont have to pay to go up the tower because you get great views Seoul just from the top and get to see the lock bridges Buy your lock before you get up there because its expensive once youre up
3441,4,Best viewed at night The cable car ride costs W8500 round trip per adult and there is food and drink up top For an additional fee you can get up to the tower Be ready for long lines because this is a popular spot particularly of lovers There are tons of love locks all over the fence lines that it blocks views But the night time view of Seoul is inspiring Some people walk down but you can cab it up and down
3442,4,A very pleasant walk in the park to reach the towerA fine view of the city below even in the mist I try to forget the locks
3443,5,Wonderful view of the city of Seoulpadlock exhibit was interestingthe XMas Tree padlocks were amazing The walk incline was a great walk but would be a challenge for those with ambulatory issues
3444,4,A must see tourist atraction when in seoul Beautiful view of seoul from up above  Plenty of 3d museum to choose from Didnt get to ride the cable car but its ok There is always another trip
3445,3,This a tourist spot but the view is amazing I went up to the observation desk took lots of photos Then had a glass of wine to enjoy the view This is a great at night or sunset
3446,4,The N Tower is fun to visit  you can see the panorama of Seoul and even put a little lock with your name on the treelock The way up to the lift is long windy and arduous  hence use the inclining lift cabin on the main road  its much more fun unless youre into hiking  There is a shop at the bottom of the cabin which offers all kind of merchandise  dont be tempted as prices are atrocious and you can get things twice as cheap in the town  Purchase a return ticket  dont be tempted to purchase a ticket with a meal and off you go  There is a lift that could take you up the 5 flights of stairs but only if youre very old or very pregnant   we braved the lift anyway and were told that we have to be punished by waiting 10 min for such disobedience The visitors are lined up in a very military  communist regime style  you do what you told  but this is all part of the experience  Up the top there are more steps to conquer  then youre almost at the top The views are great and there are plenty of opportunities for the photographs and selfies  There is a concert available on a daily basis   worth watching for a bit and there are plants of eateries up the top although the prices are higher that in downtown Seoul  In the way back try to take you place on the bottom right corner of the cable car  thats where you can have the best view as the car descends to the ground
3447,5,I would recommend going up to the tower by cable cart and then coming down Nasam walking to enjoy the park as well
3448,5,Awesome view of the huge city that is Seoul And take the popcorn and beer package just take it
3449,4,this place is located on a mountain we can go there by taking a shuttle bus around Myeongdong area After arrived there we can go up to see the tower by walking or taking the cable car We can get inside the tower and go up to enjoy the city scenery from the top of tower entrance ticket needed It is a nice place for couples and families
3450,4,Great 360 degree view of Seoul nest seen on a clear day Sunset is best time but busy over weekends You do notice that air is cleaner than below The cable car is worth it going up but if its busy save your money walk down using one way ticket It is a steep walk up from the street Views are great you can see the expanse that is Seoul There are 1000s of locks attached to the fence like on the Parisian bridge and you can buy them onsite There is a burger restaurant and Michelin starred restaurant on the site
3451,4,Im on a trip here to South Korea for my sons wedding Not only are the people extremely nice but there are plenty of amazing sites to see the Tower being one of them From taking a cable car up top of the mountain then zooming up to the top for dinner or if you choose a buffet Amazing views of Seoul  unless it is on a hazy day You can also visit the love locks which my son and his fiance put their heart lock on and signed If you are here you must take time to at least see the observation deck Its amazing
3452,3,Went up the cable car and then walked to the tower to take the elevator up from the cable car Nice attraction to see and be at but not worth to go out of your way Famous tower but is a tourist spot
3453,4,I lived in S Korea for two years and the best time of year to visit the country is spring and fall The weather is perfect that time of year frigid cold in winter and more humid than FL in summer with lots of rain Better than the weather though is the air clarity and quality So I recommend hitting up Seoul tower in the spring or fall because the air is more likely to be clear and less polluted If you get there in late April May you are going to hit the yellow dust but you will see the flowering trees and flowers In the fall the trees offer so many different colors We went to the tower at sunset which gave us amazing sunset photos until the rain hit us There is a shuttle that will take you from the bottom of the hill to the top and a railcar We took the shuttle but man the lines can be long and the later the day the less busses so its hard to catch one We did not go up the tower I enjoyed stayed down watching the city and mingling with the people enjoying the space We left around 89 pm and there were hardly any buses running so we walked down
3454,4,We visited the tower at night and it was great to see the city sites at night There are many love locks on the fences It is quite a walk from where the bus drops you off so I would not recommend to visit here if you have difficulty in walking
3455,5,We like to visit places that have nice aerial views around the world and this was indeed a nice one Its sad to see the effects of pollution but it was a great experience with the value added of showing how far different places in the world are If you have time when in Seoul dont miss this one
3456,4,The view from above is very nice and beautiful also if you are couple this place is very romantic at nighttheres many photo spot for you to take a picture
3457,5,On the last nite in Seoul we visited this beautiful Seoul time just only from the bus stop area where we took foto to the tower and city view  Since we hadnt enough time to go to the tower  it was after dinner and still 30 min to go to our hotel  It is worth the nite visit to N Seoul Tower and I dont know why they call it N Seoul Tower 
3458,5,This was awesome to see it at night There was lights  sights to see down in the city around us The Temple was all lite up and looking up the Tower it was awesome A must see for anyone visiting Seoul South Korea at NIGHT
3459,5,N Seoul tower offers some of the most breathtaking views of Seoul We went in the evening and we were able to watch the sunset over the city It was so beautiful to watch the city light up at night as the sun set I highly recommend visiting later in the day so you can witness the sunset We did a ton of sightseeing that day so we opted for the cable car The price is minimal and it saved us a ton more walkingstairs The cable car is popular so be prepared to wait in line headed in both directions There is a restaurant in the tower that offers dinner as well as snack and coffee counters  It is traditional for couples to leave a lock on the rails at the top of the hill My husband and I purchased a love lock from the store They are expensive on site 15 but we opted for the two locks so one stayed in Korea and one traveled home with us as a souvenir
3460,5,This tower is a must see when you star in elevator a light show welcomes you and show projections outside and inside elevator  View is amazing with many interesting information available
3461,3,I dont know but theres nothing really special about the Namsan Tower I mean if you been to other towers around the world youd agree Just a typical sightseeing place for tourists who need a quick picture
3462,4,If in Seoul you will always catch a glimpse of this tower when walking on the streets This is a must visit You can have breathtaking views of Seoul Its got some attractions like 3d art museum inside for taking pictures Also while going up there is a place where there are a lot of padlocks must visit that too
3463,5,We took a slow and nice walk up the hill to the tower It is a walkable distance from Myeongdong We took the cable car up to the tower at night the lights were beautiful and the weather was nice and cool Went up the tower and we enjoyed the ride up the view was amazing and we tried to spot our accommodation from the top of the tower A must do is to send a postcard back home as this is one of the highest postbox in the world If we were to come back we would take a walk up the hill especially during Spring where you can see Cherry blossoms
3464,4,Its a place for romance  provides a spectacular view of Seoul When the city lights light up the view will be amazing
3465,5,This is a very amazing place since I cant do the same at home for me the experience is unique I took the Namsan cable car to the tower and the view is beautiful; best time to go is on the afternoon to watch the sunset This is a place where many couples go to you would find locks representing their love before going into the tower They have gift shops and restaurantcafe inside the tower Ticket was about 1000 or 10000 won per person Theres not much to do unless you are with company and are going to eat in there
3466,5,Seoul is a mega city We know this although maybe we dont understand what it means  The N Tower makes you realise and appreciate what it looks likes to gave millions of people living in a relatively small amount of space The views will leave you in awe and make this a must see in Seoul  The price is low compared to similar places in other cities around the world only 10000 won  You can get there by hiking up the hill which is actually really nice or getting the cable car walk from Myeongdong tube station to cable car about 10 minutes You can probably get a taxi up as well  Best to go on a weekday to avoid crowds We went along the afternoon around 4 and we actually didnt need to queue up for the lift at all It got a lot busier in the evening
3467,4,I love the view and the place though we only stayed outside For the easiest and fastest way to the tower use the cable car Food is also available and a lot of photo ops 
3468,5,If you want to really get perspective on the size of Seoul is then this is a must This place We were really awed by the citys density and sprawl The steps are a very pretty walk but you need to be fit we only did them going down which was quite tough
3469,5,Awesome view of city in the evening We climbed and spend good time It is very cool and has excellent preservation of nature in the city Amazed to see how good they have maintained
3470,3,Long wait to take the tram up from main road as there is only 1 car Lots of standing You could walk up the rather steep steps if you have good knees Thereafter another long wait for cable cars We took about 15 hours to get up Loads of people once you get off the cable cars Last of the cherry blossoms was lovely though The locks of love though gimmicky was actually nice You can buy lock from the stall up there I think we paid krw7000 for one To get away from the sea of people we bought a Cass beer each and was allowed to sit at a bistro overlooking the city not superb views but ok for a rest n beer
3471,2,Went there on a hot sunny afternoon after quick shopping in myeongdong Wasnt easy 2 find our way to the cable car I find that signagesdirections r lacking a lot in Seoul for main tourist attrctions It was nothing amusing watching the view fr the tower perhaps it would better at night The park before going up the tower was quite relaxing though Give this a miss if u hav a packed itinerary
3472,5,The best way to see all of Seoul Ive been up there a few times in Summer and Winter when I had friends visiting me and both times it was spectacular The perfect way to get a view of all of Seoul You have to visit the Tower if youre in Korea
3473,2,This is a really small tower when compared to towers in other parts of the world The area is quite and nature friendly Good for couples  Closest scares from metro is by Myeongdong station Have to walk around 400 meters to get to the cable car access Buy tickets and go up Coming down its better to walk if you enjoy nature walking  Tower access costs extra The main attraction I found here is that couples tie a lock on the rails Never seen anything like this Anywhere else in the world So buy your lock from the Myongdang market under the street while going there  A good view of the city is an added advantage  Click helpful if you find this post helpful
3474,5,The best time to visit N seoul tower is around evening time 56pm and you will get the view before sunset during and after We were amazed by the awesome view There is bus from seoul and few areas straight up to tower and you require to walk up 5 min This is the cheapest and fastest way  There is few restaurants and souvenir shop right up the top with lots of photo worthy places  Do spend 12hours here to enjoy the view and have a cup of coffee
3475,4,I was staying in the Hyatt and they provided a map detailing walkingjogging routes to the Tower Very pleasant walk through woodland dotted with the occasional garden Very peaceful until you reach the Tower where you come across the tourist buses and the hundreds of tourists  it was a Saturday though To be honest even though busy it was nt that bad and you did not have to wait long to get spectacular 360 degree views of Seoul This time did nt take the lift to the top of the Tower but for KRW21K it is worth it on a clear day A number of restaurants and bars available if you need refreshments For me it was well worth the walk up the hill
3476,4,The Tower was visible from near the hotel so decided to walk A cable car ride gets you to the tower base Another ticket needed to go up into the tower One novel sight was the 100s of 1000s of padlocks placed by couples Heard of the practice never seen it before The view from the tower was worth paying for The view over the city was hazy due to approaching rain Food outlets are all around from fast food to restaurants
3477,4,The tower is literally and figuratively top attraction Many tourists consider this as the main attraction in Seoul Accessible by a bus in Chungmuro Station However the walk from the parking area to the entrance of the tower is quite steep When on the top floor the view is fantastic Souvenirs are also available on sale
3478,4,You will know this is the seoul tower when you see it far away Maybe I was expecting an amazing view but this is just an average view If you dont have time you are not missing much This is something I would come see once for the experience but I wouldnt come for a second time I recommend coming 1 hour before the sun sets so you can see the day and night view at once Dont come on rainingcloudy days or you wont see much
3479,4,Easily reached by most public transport taxis or by foot the cable car serves the tower park and return tickets are quire economical  The park has some nice features and if you are a fan of love lock there are many areas mostly quite full where couples lock themselves in for the hard slog  The trip up the tower is by express lift and the beer combo gets you two beers for less than the price of one The usual photo booths operate on the way up which explains the long queues going in But the views from the top are fantastic and if you fancy it there is also a restaurant there  All in all a trip worth making if you have time to kill in Seoul
3480,5,We went on a Saturday evening and we didnt want to stand in the long line for the cable car so we took the hiking trail up which was a great workout and also had good views and certain points  There was a free concert going on there too and the beer  popcorn combo for 2 was quite reasonable
3481,5,Enjoyed Seoul night view we went after 8 and the tower ticket were available till 10 with closing time 11 the waiting time was around 45 mins but it was worth we took combo ticket with popcorn and drink which was really worth
3482,5,We thought the view from the top of the hill was good but we were pleased we went up the top of the tower as well as the view improves and explanations of the sights was good
3483,4,The tower gave us a great view to see the city that never ends The restaurant had many options to choose from and it was enjoyable to see the view of the city while dining
3484,5,Unlike great towers in Tokyo Beijing Toronto and great cities the Namsan Tower is not that high But with the Namsan Mountain together it is one of the very tall towers in the world It covers all it needs to cover for TV and radio for people in Seoul and cities near by  It is very friendly and allows people to come near with a fresh mountain environment That may be the main reason why there are so many people visiting day and night
3485,5,There are long lines at nightBut the views are worth every second This is an inexpensive fun thing to do The views are spectacular especially at night
3486,5,Amazing view It was a 30 minute wait for cable car and then 15 minutes for elevator but so worth it I recommend to go there when its dark outside youll see better and its beautiful with all the citylights Bring a padlock to hang outside as a memory
3487,5,This was great fun took a tram from its little station up the long hill to the tower There are gardens and benches there as well You then take an elevator ride up the tower there is food available and windows all the way around the tower signs showing distance to far away places We were there when the Cherry Blossoms were blooming and there were lots of spots to stop for pictures
3488,3,If anyone want to visit the place please be there before the sunset cause the view will be nice before dark Night view oh well it never give me the wah impact
3489,5,Ride the bus to the top if youre with young children The walk is very tiring But nice view it got up there
3490,5,If you have ever wanted to enjoy the scenic landscape of Seoul while youre urinating then this is the place for you The restaurant on the top was pretty good
3491,5,Seoul city looked alive and vibrant with lighting everywhere from up above at N Seoul Tower In here also located the second Bear Museum within this building at the basement floor Cute and cuddly bears displayed on various settings Souvenirs sold for mementos Came here twice
3492,5,I enjoyed my visit The staffs at the information counter were helpful To get there you can get a free bus ride from myeondong Just wait at the bus stop next to the subway station Just look at the signage and you will be safe
3493,3,The tower offers excellent views as you would expect from a large tower on a hill in the centre off a city It was easy to get tickets and for an additional 7000 won we also received two pints of beer and a large popcorn in addition to our two tickets Although hazy we were able to see a lot and signs around the observatory helped direct us towards various landmarks  At 1400 their is a one hour show at the plaza at the foot of the observatory This was worth staying to watch and there was enough space to get a good view The show was an exhibit of traditional fighting styles the photos will give a clearer insight
3494,4,This attraction is so close to being really good it gives a great view of the city and in nice weather its a nice couple of hours What lets it down is the quing Endless endless ques to get the lift then again to get a ticket for the cable car then again to get on the cable car then again to go up the tower They could easily sort this out but my guess is they dont want to make the investment Still if youve got a few hours to kill and its a nice day venture to the top
3495,4,From namsan guesthouse 3 just walk about 10 minutes before approaching the cable car  Waiting time queuebefore taking the cable car is around 30 minutes  we take evening Do come in morning time to avoid waiting too long  When arrive at the tower its a breathtaking and the view was very nice
3496,4,That is a must if you are in this area We walked up arround the tower this is a long way but nice to do We had Lunch there and we found a great buffet Verry good foot
3497,5,I visited Namsan Tower and you can see the beautiful city lights I havent been in the N tower I just walked around the area and still you can view the beautiful city lights of Seoul Must visit during night time
3498,4,To get a great view of the city go up to the peak of this Namsan Hill I was there during the weekday so it was not very crowded And we managed to get onto the cable car as soon as we bought the tickets The nature view and garden up here are breathtaking and one not to be missed for your picture collection
3499,3,This place is very nice lots of people taking pictures and chill around sometimes there are cultural events here when we came there was like a traditional sword and martial arts performance There are also a few snacks stalls and a small olive young here Most people will take pics as the lovelocks are all over Very lovely
3500,3,All big cities seem to have a tall tower of some description and this one is Seouls Not sure what function it serves or why it is even there One thing is for sure though that you cant miss it if in Seoul You will find it lurking in the background of many of your photos in Seoul
3501,1,caught a taxi to get up there to have a little look unfortunately the taxi didnt get me there and left me at the cable car entrance there i waited more than an our to go up than another hour to get in the lift of the tower visited 10 minutes and then it took me another hour to get back down queues everywhere i regret i went there
3502,4,Going all the way up the tower is definitely worth it cause youll have the best view over Seoul Theres also restaurants cafes there but theyre quite expensive
3503,3,Pay quote a bit to get to the top of the tower but its a bit of a letdown as it is nowhere near as high as others in Macau Seattle etc Lots of shops and park type areas around but the top of the tower itself is tiny and can be walked around in less than 30 seconds Nothing special to be honest and you wont be devastated if you missed it out when in Seoul
3504,4,You can go up to the tower for about 8500 krw and see lots from there They also have locks all over from previous couples I would say millions of them They have some cool combo deals but if you want to go on the cheap you can bring your own locks and walk back down for cheaper
3505,5,We were too late to get to the very top but we got to take the cable car to the top and hang out by the platforms  I highly recommend going for great views of the city  Its great for couples as its romantic There is a heart shaped chair to take photos in and there is a gate filled w love locks
3506,4,If you really want to be on top of the world for just a day try the NSeoul Tower This place is best for those who want to have their moments together and profess their love Not to mention going to the observation deck in a swift
3507,4,Go early in the day as it gets very busy witb tourists A stroll up to the tower is a must for any visitors to Seoul The views are wonderful and worth the walk There are places to buy snacks and drinks at the tower
3508,3,At 230ish meters this is a pretty small tower by world standards Up top the viewing deck is somewhat small the wait to get up is somewhat long and the disappointment At the lack of anything upstairs is somewhat large Its a bit of a tourist trap in every way possible Worth doing if you havent found anything better to do
3509,5,Our tourguide Chance Kim from VIP Travel had showed us around and we were so grateful to him for being so accommodating
3510,4,The North Tower is the best way to get some fantastic shots of Seoul plus theres some great souvenirs at the kiosks at the top Having said all thisGO EARLY IN THE DAY This is a very popular spot for tourists and its not unusual to wait over an hour just to get on the cable car to get to the Tower So plan ahead especially if you want to take kids I would not go to the restaurants at the Tower mostly because they are very crowded and expensive for whats offered Take some snacks and enjoy the little park area if its a nice day
3511,4,It is a pleasant walk uphill to the tower Although offering excellent views the day we went the sky was rather murky due to the dustpollution blown in from China
3512,4,Despite the long lines its well worth the trip up to see the city Better to do it at night as the city lights are amazing
3513,4,Wasnt expecting to catch the cherry blossoms so late in the season Was 2 week of April There were at least 710 bus loads worth of tourists near the foot of the tower We had wandered away from the crowds looking for a good photo opportunity along roads less travelled and threaded upon Was first our stop in Seoul was a lovely start to our trip Seoul little time Seoul much to do
3514,4,We planned to be at the tower by sunset but we were not able to do so  We walked on the way to the cable car from Myeongdong around 30 minutes We did not know we had to queue for about an hour just to ride the cable car By the time we reached the tower it was already dark  Nevertheless the view was spectacular It seems to me that all bridges and roads seen from the observatory lead to N Seoul Tower Its like being in the center and on top of the world  IT could have been more pleasurable if it wasnt too cold for an al fresco dinner or drink  I would recommend going to this place on a warmer night maybe summer
3515,5,I think you should not ride the cable car because it destroys nature But everything else is good Oh and make sure you go to Seoul an tower on a sunny day
3516,5,N Seoul Tower is a beautiful destination for pictures and to get a view of the city The observation deck gives you a great view The park around the tower is very pretty and you can take the cable car up to the tower
3517,4,We enjoyed a ride up the cable car at night It was almost closing time so had to wait in line for the ride down Beautiful view on a clear night Sweet displays of love locks and sentimental thoughts
3518,4,even the rain cant stop us strolling in N Seoul Tower This place is a must visit when travelling in Seoul View from the top of Observatory tower is very nice
3519,4,nice place great view little bit expensive you get to see Seoul at night go by cable cart nice illusions  send a postcard home with local stamp
3520,4,Awesome view and the weather is lovely  lots of tourist every corner but fun  the city view from top of the tower is breath taking beautiful
3521,4,We walked there from Myeongdong market First we used a free lift that moves diagonally over a slope Then we bought cable car tickets and waited in a long queue for almost an hour It was a Saturday The cable car took us to the base of the N Seoul Tower My wife and I contributed two lovelocks to the thousands that were already there  We went to the observation deck of the tower using a lift I didnt find the deck or the view that impressive Of course you get a good view of Seoul City But somehow that didnt impress me  When we returned to the base of the tower it was 9 pm We were fortunate to witness a electronic dance music EDM concert for free Then we returned to our hotel  I was looking forward to walking my way up and then down However my family was not so keen about walking
3522,4,The N Seoul Tower isnt tall relative to the other towers in the world but since its built on the summit of the Namsan Mountain it enjoys a nice elevated 360 view of Seoul which provides you with views of the Geongbokgung and other palaces as well as many other sights around Seoul Lets one orientate oneself around the city  The observatory consists of two floors accessible by a fast elevator
3523,5,I really love everything about this place you can find food and many beautiful souvenirs D here you can see the beautiful seoul view from all its angles 3
3524,5,Wonderful views of the city Loved mailing ourselves a postcard from the highest post in the world Received it a couple of weeks laterwhat a great memory we have
3525,5,Great experience with Seoul tower where you can get full view of the city from above We took the Seoul city bus tour to get there It worked out best if you get the Observatory combo which includes 2 adult tickets 1 large popcorn and 1 large drink for 21000won If you buy tickets separately it will cost 12000won each Should check out their restroom as well stunning view from above
3526,5,It was super amazing People go to Namsan for the view and the famous love locks but I always go for the traditional performance Its at 3 and it has the dance with percussions first and then the martial arts part with weapons and all
3527,4,Managed to catch some leftover of cherry blossom up at the N Seoul tower We took a cablecar up and down as we are Travelling with two young toddlers The cablecar is big enough to accommodate the stroller  you do not have to fold them  which is very convenient for family travelling with young children It is a very stable ride up and down the tower  If you are fit and strong the option of hiking up the TOP is also available if you choose not to take the cablecar ride Nice view from the TOP Restaurants and souvenir shop is also available up there should you need a bite or coffee break On a side note after taking the cablecar ride down you may choose to walk down to the Main Street  appro ximately10 mins  which have a children animated museum Quite an interesting place with plenty of photos taking opportunity if you are travelling with young children All in all is a nice trip up the Tower
3528,5,I cant lie the tower is a bit of a tourist trap but you cant visit Seoul without seeing it just once I highly recommend going at night to see the city all lit up  the view is gorgeous We rode the cable car which was nothing spectacular but it felt like a necessary part of the experience Pro tip If youre taking a taxi you may need to ask for Namsan Tower rather than Seoul Tower
3529,3,Beautiful place to go at night time Will see many teenage couples there Cable cars are very full and busy The entire place is busy overall
3530,4,peaceful place suitable place for family vacation before u go to namsan tower u can go to namdaemun market first for shoppingsouvenir tshirt ext
3531,4,Though tower can go up with cable car recommend to walk up as the scenery are amazing fresh air green tree and view of the city
3532,4,The climb was arduously hard especially for people with weak legs It was steep But the view was picturesque you can see the whole city including the sea and mountains The place is filled with beautiful flowers Aside from that theres a lot of places there where you can take pictures  View aside if youre with your special someone its a place for you You will enjoy the place with locks the benches and displays for lovers  The souvenir shops carry a lot cute and unique items However they are more expensive compared to the other shops who also sells souvenirs
3533,5,Nice view of the city in the day as well as in the night You should go to Seoul Tower if you are in Seoul
3534,5,Namsan tower is very nice place U can choose either want to walk or use cable car The place is many of love padlock I like an environment there
3535,5,There is a cable car which runs regularly to the top It cost 13500 won We managed to go late in the afternoon which made it possible to see the city at sunset and with the city lights On the windows surrounding the tower are distances to world cities There are platforms outside to enjoy the panoramic views The only food available are popcorn soft drinks and candy
3536,4,Dont miss the pork cutlet rice after your walk of cherry blossom There is a row of good restaurant for you to try
3537,4,One of the star attractions of Seoul is the Seoul tower You can locate it from distance as well as its quite high and also located on the hill Nice place to visit
3538,4,An elevator takes you up and you can see 360 views of the city Its really spectacular especially considering South Korea is 70  mountain and one cannot see the horizon Being that high up you can see for miles There is of course the requisite shopping when you are tired of the views It is worth the trip If you have a fear of heights not to worry there is plenty of heavy glass and metal posts so one doesnt get the sense they will fall Do use the restroom on the floor below  there are views from the restroom as well
3539,4,Visible from many places including Banana Backpackers very appealing Even at the base of the tower the views are great
3540,4,They have nice view when u reaches the top of the tower They have created this tower into a Lover Tower too which u can buy a love lock to lock it into the love tree or the side railing
3541,5,The Tower itself is cool The observation deck has an amazing view both day and night The area around N Seoul Tower is beautiful You can walk up the trail to the tower or take the cable car either way it will be an enjoyable experience for you Its alot of walking if you want to walk up the tower but great exercise
3542,4,If you visit seoulyou must visit N Seoul Towerthis tower is a symbol of koreadont forget to bring your padlock and write your name and your couple also
3543,5,A must visit for any season of the year There is a cafe a museum a super cool lift that goes up to space and pf course a great view from above
3544,5,The views from the top of the tower are fantastic You can walk the whole 360 degrees and see for miles You can even enjoy a drink and some yummy things to eat A great feature are the directions and distances of a number of places around the world as you walk around the viewing platform An absolute must visit
3545,4,First time i get this place My eyes is look toward the bear that hanging on the tower It was a nice place The lock of love is looks like in the other city like paris or etc
3546,4,The view from the Tower is not so different from the base of the tower in my opinion The glass at the top is not as transparenttoo much glare so you can only see when you are right up to the window whereas I have been to other towers and its completely clear from wherever you stand Having said that its pretty economical to go up 10000 per person 21000 for two people plus a huge popcorn and two drinks  Popular couples spot but fun for families and solo travellers as well 
3547,4,We went up on a very foggy evening so it was so cold and the view is not so good nevertheless it was a very good place to visit We can still see a great night view despite of the fog For those who are fit a walk in the park would be best plus the Cherry Blossoms on your way up is an added attraction
3548,4,Forget the bus or taxi going here Take the cable car instead  The scenic view although relatively a short distance and the experience is what you get your moneys worth actually  This place is where past meets present and gives you a sneak peak of the future The 360 degree view of the entire city of Seoul is breathtaking  Oh and the elevator See it for your self 
3549,4,It is one of the most popular landmark in Seoul so if you have time head to the N Seoul Tower The view from the mountian is stunning There is a cable car which can take you up there but you can also walk up  about 3 km if the weather is nice There are some restaurants up there as well so it is nice to spend a few hours there
3550,4,A must visit during ur days in Seoul Went up to the Seoul tower and had a panoramic view of Seoul city It was amazing You can have a walk up to the Seoul Tower or take public transport both will give you different experience
3551,5,My 6 year old son 63 year old mother loved our visit to the N Seoul tower It was amazing Going to the observatory deck was a beautiful experience Great view of the city as well as the Namsan mountain It was cherry blossom season so we had the opportunity to really get up close and personal Best way to see cherry blossoms in full bloom in Namsan mountain Loved the love locks area as well most especially if youre a KDrama fan Weather is good at the top during Spring Loved it Would go back again with husband Maybe try going there at night for a different experience
3552,4,Namsan Seoul Tower is a great place to see a view of Seoul Take note that to take the cable car to the tower area is a fee by itself and to go up to the tower is another fee So be prepared Best time to go here would be at night as you get to see a beautiful night view of Seoul from here Can get pretty crowded too
3553,4,the tower affords a pretty amazing view of Seoul as well as the beautiful hillside park surrounding the Tower Be careful about letting someone talk you into walking up the hill It is longer than you think
3554,5,We had this included in our tour of the city and it was a amazing view from the top Very busy but worth it You get to see the schemer scale of the city from uphere although Im told that visibility can be poor when the pollution from China drifts across the citymiso avoid if its not a clear day The trip up to the base of the tower itself can be via cable car or walking if your energetic but the cable car is quite fun Great way to see the city
3555,4,We took the cable car up and it had just started getting foggy so by the time we were up there we couldnt see Seoul but on a nice day you can see for miles my wifes sister told us There was also a restaurant up there which you have to climb stairs to get to and beyond To see all of this you must be in good physical shape
3556,3,A bit too touristy for my taste but the surrounding park is well worth having a stroll in Walk in the park and if you have time try the tower
3557,4,A right choice to travel up to Namsan Park in the evening to catch the sunset view Magnificent panoramic view of the night scene of Korea A mustgo place if you want to catch the night view of Korea in the lovers park 
3558,5,We came here when green leaves started growing and some petals were on the wooden walking bridges  Its nice and lovely but busy Worth to visit one time
3559,5,What an amazing place to visit in seoul Even if you dont want to pay to go up the tower just standing outside you have a great view The Love Lock wall was ny favorite Make sure to buy a lock write your names and lock it amongst the other lovers Was awsome attraction
3560,5,I liked the idea of lockers we was having our luggage of shopping and we wasnt sure if there is large locker to put the bag on it and there was We enjoyed the view of the seoul then we enjoyed the museum there and we had our Coffee on nature it was amazing experience
3561,4,Nice area nice view to the Seoul city You can drive up jogging up or take the cable car up We took the cable car But the price for the ride was not cheap The cable car was lousily designed compared to cable car at MaoKongTaiwan or Langkawi Malaysia It was a short ride as well  The scenery around the tower was great We could see the lights of Seoul city from a high area There were lots of gate there for couple to install their love locks  To go up the tower need extra entrance fee Thus we decided not going up to the tower
3562,3,I been visit to KL tower Petronas Twin Tower However I felt it is not a must place to visit in Seoul if you want to see something cultural  There is this Love Lock area in the ground floor of N Seoul Tower which is quite a scenery similar to Paris Love Lock
3563,4,Great views of Seoul especially at night You can purchase a lock there and affix it to the fence A cable car takes you to the base of the tower There is a cafe and observation deck at the top
3564,5,Beautiful views great walk up and a must do in Seoul Take your time on the way up to admire the scenery and enjoy a nice meal when you arrive at the Tower Great way to spend the day
3565,4,on a clear day that is When its hazy you still see a lot though If you dont want to climb the hill take the cable car
3566,4,Went up by lift down by cable car Nice view of the city Can see cherry blossom too April Will recommend to anyone who wants to hv a good view of Seoul
3567,4,Scenic view of Seoul without having to go up the tower Just at the foot of the Tower at the Summit a nice walkway of Cherry Blossom
3568,3,Been to Macau tower and Crowne plaza Cebuand N SeoulTower is no bettter But the location is indeed ideal for sightseeing though the way to get there may be tough for newcomers  What stood out is the viewdeck with the names of major cities around the world indicating the countries and the distance from the Seoul tower  Suggest a traveler visits in the morning for a better appreciation of the view
3569,5,Set in park land and accessed either by cable car or a path through the park Good idea to get cable car up and walk down Views even from foot of tower are spectacular and worth seeing at night Also there there is a daily beacon lighting ceremony 11am and martial arts display 3pm
3570,5,Great views and good culture brilliant all round I enjoyed going up the cable car and also seeing how far we were above sea level and the distance to different countrys
3571,4,The cable car ride was awesome We didnt get the chance to get to the tower due to time restrain Some of our lady friends got to try on the national costume Restos are available around the area
3572,4,Im glad my friend and I decided to go Namsan tower to try our luck for cherry blossoms after the end of youeido cherry blossom festival This location has more cherry blossoms in bloom minus the crowd and you can get wonderful pictures We took the shuttle bus and drop off at the base at the mountain Awesome view during the hike up Easy walk and very relaxing with the cool weather Took about an hour with photo taking
3573,5,Its a must in seoul specially during spring We took the bus strolling through sakura with amazing view of the city from up Many restaurants and cafes just take your drink and enjoy the view at sunset Lovers buy lockers and make wishes Its a must
3574,4,Although we visited the Seoul at different times of the year the recent visit during the cherryblossom season was the best From Seoul station the blue bus takes you to the public library from where the scenic walk takes you all the way up to the tower and back The place visited by many locals and tourists That time the carparks are overloaded and buses continuously take tourists up and down Namsan hill So many scening areas along the way invite for making pictures or picnic
3575,4,Beautiful at night We did not go up the tower but only went up to the platform to do our locks of love Even that scenery is nice much less the one at the top Go at night for a better view
3576,5,If you are looking for the highest point in the city of seoul this might be the one There are several food served with great city views and for sure the legendary key park where there is believe if you write down your name and your spouses your love will last forever
3577,3,nothing much to shop around only good thing is the night view shuttle bus was crowded left after an hour
3578,5,It was hard to locate the cable car to get up to the Tower by looking at the map We finally took a cab to the cable car station Waited about 30 minutes for the cable car Maybe because it was a weekend so it was very busy Prices are quite steep for food n drinks there
3579,4,better take the oreum travellator than to walk from Pacific hotel we went up from pacific hotel tiring to the cable car station
3580,5,Spring is a perfect time to go to Namsan Park and walk up to N Seoul Tower The sights are just beautiful Wear your best walking shoes and dont forget your cameras
3581,5,Not necessary to take the cable car up A walk up was nice too Although the tower was pretty touristy a good mix of local crowd was there also
3582,4,On a good day you can have a nice view over Seoul but the queues for the cable car can be over an hour long so be prepared to wait   
3583,4,Fun time Cable car was experience to the top and the evening view was beautiful They have cafes and two restaurants
3584,5,Worth a visit for the photo ops from the top observation deck Can be crowded Be patient and you will be rewarded
3585,5,With the changing air quality in Seoul you need to choose your day to ensure a good view The tower is lit each night with a colour to predict the air quality the following day Green is good  Good combi packages available to go up the tower but also good views from the bottom Lots of options to get to the tower bus; taxi; cable car; or walking A walk down to the park is a good way to finish or walk down to the Hanock village for a bit of culture too Lots of options at all price levels for eating
3586,4,A walk up to the tower is rewarded with attractions and fun foods Great views in the fall when the leaves have changed colors Enjoy some ice cream or churro and a burger Or choose to dine at one of the other locations around the base It also makes for a great romantic date
3587,4,If you are into Kdrama this is a must for you The colourful locks were very nice and captivating that we cant help but reading the notes attached to it one by one Also you can see the whole Seoul from the tower
3588,5,Theres no where in town to get a better view of Seoul Here you can see the whole city from a higher point of view and then you get to buy some nice souvenirs and have some quality food If youre going to Seoul this place is a must It lets you view the city in a whole other perspective
3589,3,Queuing for going up and going down we spent more than 2 hours doing that I didnt find the view as impressive as I was expecting it
3590,4,Great place to view the setting sun and the gorgeous seoul cityscape Its touristy but youll only be here if youre a touristha There are two ways to get here 1 cable car 2 walk along the city walls  its a long walk and for the adventurous There are a ton of eateries atop Go if you have an evening to space go for sunset Its in Namsan so if youre staying somewhere in Namsan can walk to the cable car station
3591,4,Another tower another quick lift another revolving restaurant not tested This is Seoul Tower which obviously offers splendid of all sides of the city and for this it is worth the queue and the detour No discussion especially because Seoul is a complex and diverse city with all its hills and its difficult too appreciate it globally otherwise This being said the tower itself is nothing special even rather on the dated side in comparions with many others for example the windows are straight and dirty which is not ideal to take pictures Th cable car to reach the tower is very nice too and offers nice views on central Seoul and the mountains
3592,3,The observation deck is small and there is not much storytelling or explanation of the places you can see from the tower The gifts sold on site are exquisite and thats the best part of the place
3593,4,We experienced fantastic views of the city on a bright and clear spring day We timed it so we would see the sunset and Seoul at night highly recommend doing it this way but allow time for the cable cars as queues can be quite long We enjoyed the walk back down rather than queuing for the cable car again
3594,5,The view from the tower is amazing One can see all throughout Seoul One of the cool things we found was the different cities listed with the kilometers away from the tower
3595,4,Yes I have a habit of going to high point when I visit to somewhere Thats what I said like the title buy anyway it was nice
3596,4,Is like Eiffel for Paris Burj Al Arab of Dubai N tower is a tower that somehow marketed to represent Seoul Which is the reason why it is also called the Seoul Tower  There are restos in top of the tower and cafes on the ground floor This is were youll find the famous love locks They have a viewing area on top of the tower but there is also a deck on the grounds where you can have a view of the city
3597,4,You get to see the whole city from just one tower I recommend not to go at Christmas because itll get extremely crowded and will take hours to get to the top of the tower When you get to Namsan there are little stores that you can go to like get ice cream There are a few stores that sell food and theres a gift shop too
3598,4,Need to take cable car to go to the tower Estimated time to get into the cable car is about 45 minutes as always long long queue night scenery from the tower is amazing N seoul tower also famous for love locks unfortunately laser lights show was temporary suspended during my visit in Mac due to regulatory inspections
3599,5,I thought the highlight is the elevator with fancy animations but I was wrong It is the view on top as well as the experience getting in and out of there
3600,5,We took subway to Myeong dong and walked abt 15 mins to the cable car station  Another opinion was to walk up which we are not so adventurous and no stamina  along the way Theres many shops with fancy deco and a line of restaurants b4 reaching the station   Everything is so organized at the station as everyone lined up orderly one shortfall is the toilet  Only 1 cubicle and its pretty stressful with ppl waiting outside if u need the loo  Upon arrival at the tower  its so beautiful  Theres a part outdoor where u see many love locks along the walkway   Theres a trick eye museum there but the queue was very long with tourist groups so we decided to give it a miss   Love the souvenir shop many nice items that u bring home for momento  
3601,3,Initially planned for a hike up but it was way too cold so we took the bus up and boy were we thankful Its quite a long journey up Didnt really managed to see the sunset as it was pretty cloudy Its a tower View of the skyline from above is a sight to behold not possibly captured through camera lenses Eat at the restaurant Churro there are delicious On a good day itll be a nice to walk up
3602,4,Great view from the tower to see the city even though from indoor observation deck We went up and coming back using cable car and during a night time it was nice with all the lights around the city At the plaza area they have fence full of padlock love padlock _ you can buy padlock there and write your wish and lock it along the fence They have restaurantcafe as well I would recommend to go here
3603,5,This place will help you to see the entire city in few seconds I visited it during the day and I really enjoyed the location
3604,4,U dont have to go upif u r budget traveler just to reach up the mountain is great and free Before sun set was WOW
3605,4,I went up there at night for the very first time during my last travel and the stunning view of the city caught me  Although the place may be a bit crowded during peak seasons it is still a mustvisit especially for first timers 
3606,4,We took the walk up to the base of tower and it was quite pleasant While we decided not to actually go up the tower because we had already been to plenty of towers earlier in our Asia trip However the base of the tower had plenty to offer Good scenery and there was a cultural performance at the courtyard when we arrived Otherwise fairly ordinary but we were glad we skipped the cable car and walked down the opposite side from the way we came up
3607,5,It was really nice we had to take a cable car and walk up and we saw Seoul city site and it was beautiful It is nice and worth the visit if you forgot to bring a lock dont worry they sell them up there
3608,5,Had a beautiful view of Seoul from the top Could see Seoul 360 degrees Fantastic  Staff at N Seoul Tower are very efficient
3609,5,Enjoyed the cable car ride to the top of the hill where the N Seoul Tower is located and enjoyed the smooth ride up and the opportunity to see the city from above We didnt go up in the tower as it was starting to get foggy and the view was becoming limited but we did enjoy the park like area at the top and the thousands and thousands of token to love in the form of locks  yes locks everywhere you looked Quite the sight and a top 10 destination while in Seoul There are places to get some refreshment or have a picnic
3610,5,Best Experience and a must visit place in Seoul We took a cable car to top and the view was awesome
3611,5,We took the cable car up and walked down I think thats the best way of doing it personally We thought it was great during the week not a lot of people and great views just a tad expensive
3612,5,A must see tourist attraction Views of the entire city are wonderful We didnt go all the way up to the top of the tower as you can see all views from the exterior viewing areas
3613,2,Went here at night so the experoence might be different during the day  It is a long ride to the top and when you get there you can view the city from behind a 360 degree glass viewing deck  Aside from the shops and food not much to do here I would rather have spent the time doing something else
3614,2,Its a really nice view but not really worth the wait and fre to go to the observation deck You get pretty much the same view at the base of the tower If you are going up do it in the evening when its dark Its so much cooler to see the city lit up by all the lights
3615,5,Dont bother with the cable car Easy walk to the top Good views from stopping points Would highly recommend going Can do up one side and down the other
3616,4,We visited Seoul tower at night We caught the cable car which was great and once we arrived paid to enter View was amazing Try and go on a clear night and if you can avoid weekends Theres a queue for the cable car; queue for the lift to the tower and queue for coming back down in the lift and for back on the cable car Long waits but great view
3617,4,Seoul Tower is definitely a cool place to visit for your first time in Seoul Keep in mind that it does take an effort to get up to it a pretty steep paved inclined road but once you get up to the tower area the views are worth it It was pretty cloudy the day we went up to the top of the tower but the views were still great to experience anyway Another cool part is the love locks area Definitely check that out and add a lock if youre there with your special someone 
3618,4,We came here but not going up to the tower We only see the suroundings You have to pay if you want to go up to the tower There is a coffee shop under the tower open at 10am There is a love padlocks area So you can bring your own padlocks You also can get a nice city view from the love padlocks area
3619,5,I wanted to visit this tower so much It was so peaceful and beautiful This has to be in your top 10 places to visit in Seoul
3620,5,Beautiful scenery spread everywhere Cold and windy you better put your coat on Even more beautiful at night because it has a light show But there is not enough restaurant or even bench to enjoy the view from outside the tower
3621,5,We hiked up from the bottom through the park as it was a perfect day 2km ish up Be aware that there are squat toilets on route not normal ones  The actual tower is great and gives stunning views over the entire city You can even get a package including entrance popcorn and beer to go up with Entry isnt excessive either  This is a must see for visitors to Seoul
3622,4,This is located in Namsam Good to see the city view from the hill  Also there is restaurants in N Tower
3623,5,Long queue on Sunday which we visited The queue took almost 1 hr to get to the base of n seoul tower through the cable car Be prepared to be packed like sardines in the cable car  We didnt went up to the observatory as it was getting dark There are souvenir shops and restaurants We even brought our own locks to lock at the bridge You can buy locks there
3624,5,Went on late afternoon watched the sunset although a bit crowded the experience is just fantastic Besides coolest bathrooms you will ever experience
3625,5,I had an opportunity to hike at Namsan Fortress Trail going to N Seoul Tower The hike was very worth it I also visited the Teddy Bear Museum inside Also I went up and see a spectacular view of Seoul
3626,4,We went around 4 PM so the lines to buy tickets and board the cable car were about 2 hours long Once up to the base of the tower by cable car there are shops and a few things to see but there are a lot of people awaiting their elevator time slot so it can be crowded The views from the top are nice and the city lights are very pretty The line to come down can get long so be careful you arent stuck at the top near closing time as you have to remember you need to take not only the elevator down but the cable car or a long walk down the stairs I would say it is worth it but budget enough time at least 45 hours if starting n the late afternoonevening 
3627,4,Love the city view of Seoul that I had while taking the tram up to the N Seoul Tower Loved the colours during sunset  The night view was superb as well with the neon colours of the tower
3628,4,I love everything here From the tower lock of love are and surounding Its beautiful especially in the evening The color of the light on the tower will changing in the evening Last time I came here there was a Teddy Bear Museum The museum is gone now Replace by a few restaurant Im happy because they still keeping the Lock of Love area here So we can put something here to remember
3629,4,Amazing view at night We took a long one hour and a half hike up to the top not very smart decision but I have a Wonderful time with my daughter  Love the scenery 
3630,4,My fiance and I did an evening trip to the N tower We found it a good sight The troll ride up always full but offered a good view and a cool experience The view from the decks and the tower especially gives you a great feel for just how huge and expansive Seoul really is There is the locks of love countless amounts of them for the love birds out there There is some touristy aspects but not bad Gotta do this when in Seoul
3631,4,We had a great time here enjoying the view We took the cable car up and it was real easy The only thing I suggest is that you come here during warm weather When we visited it was cold and windy
3632,3,Very long climb and not much to do from the top except take photos and get a nice view of Seoul  Because of the long climb you can easily spend 3 hours in the area which is better spent elsewhere  The viewing area is enclosed so not very romantic The locks area is cool for couples though  Would just visit this once but there are better places to go
3633,4,all my reviews about seoul are effected with the fact they are not stroller friendly and if there was by any chance an elevator again it would be either out of service or way far went at night if you want a view of the city its better do it during day time
3634,5,The tower apparently has a lighting system that signifies the air quality We lucked out and visited on the clearest day of our trip You reach the tower by walking up a winding incline or take a cable car 3 minute ride At the tower observation decks afford an impressive view but the best view is from the tower Tickets may be purchased at the ticket office at the base of the tower The panoramic views are impressive and they will take your photo 12000 for 1 5x7 photo or 20000 for 2 with a green screen to allow changing screens Food and souvenirs are available for purchase
3635,3,one must go and catch the sunset here beautiful surroundings interesting place you can enjoy it here solo with family or with friends
3636,3,I visited seoul tower in the month of July It was my birthday so I got a good discount for visiting seoul tower They also offer many foreigners and couples discount Tower was just fine as there was nothing much to do View from the top was good and thats all Get some pictures clicked with a background view and you are done You can also purchase souvenirs for yourself We carried out our own lunch so dont have much idea about the food services there After having our lunch we visited the alive museum which was right next to the Seoul tower I would highly recommend you to visit Alive museum if you want to have super fun and planning to visit Seoul tower Otherwise visiting seoul tower alone is a complete waste of time in my opinion Good luck 
3637,3,We had the wrong time to visit N Seoul Tower there was a scheduled fireworks display and so the place being up high and a good viewing area was jampacked with people so we did not enjoy it much It was even difficult to get on a bus from somewhere near Myeongdong to N Seoul Tower If it were a different day it would have been better  That aside I think NSeoulTower area is an entertaining place with food places Bear museum good view of Seoul and a good place to walk around be prepared if you want to walk uphill though
3638,5,We took the tram to the base of the tower bought our tickets and rode the elevator to the top Its worth the extra dollar for the popcorn and soda The views were spectacular and since this may be my only trip to Seoul I am glad I did it Then we walk all the way down the hill to find the subway
3639,5,I went there with a group of 15 people and everyone of them loved it Its a very romantic place so if you are planning to impress your date this is it
3640,4,Easy to get to by metro and shuttle bus And surrounded by a national park Go on a clear day though Its a bit featureless rely but does gave reasonable views over Seoul Its not expensive and you can spend a couple of hours on the trio including going up the towers
3641,5,Specifically recommend visiting Seoul tower during the day near sunrise or sunset as the view is simply astounding This is a photo worth sharing
3642,4,This is landmark one of the most visited site in Korea Its the highest ground in central Seoul you can observe everywhere especially in good clear weather But beware so many tourists will be also there you might have to walk in line and get tired soon  you dont have to spend  to get to the top of the tower The view from the peak itself is beautiful enough Early morning and late at night are the best time to check out the view
3643,4,There is a tower in every country but N Soeoul Tower will give you special experience There are special area on the top for couples families and someone who has got a specific hope You should buy a padlock before you go and write your wishes there to use permanent pen There is a cable car to the summit but you have a strong legs you can enjoy the beautiful walkway to the summit Also whenever I go there I go to famous restaurant in front of the area Its pork cutlet with rice but I cant remember the name of restaurant
3644,5,Nice to visit for a short period of time  The view from top of N Tower is fabulous And even from the bottom of the tower the view is very nice Dont even need to take the elevator up to the top  The only drawback is that have to take a bus up to the tower which can be a bit inconvenient
3645,5,Its a place when you will really have a great view of the surrounding For first time traveler I believe that if you have the opportunity to visit the Tower grab the opportunity Especially for those who enjoys watching a beautiful scenery
3646,3,Have to confess that we never found time to get to the top of the Tower But it is a pretty visible highlight of Seoul as its situated atop a hill Its often hazy due to pollution and Dust Im told the dust come from China but that makes it more Star Wars like to me
3647,4,Good places but still renovated was we come so we unsure what the best value about this places We just view all the Seoul city view from this places
3648,2,we took a cab to the cable car station  followed by a 8000 per person cable car ride up to the tower base Before taking an elevator to the tower top Frankly nothing thrilling the tower is amongst the lowest in the world
3649,5,A great 360 view of Seoul Get there early to avoid the queues Restrooms and restaurants available so you wont get caught short 10000\ Make sure you have a clear day to visit other wise its a wasted journey
3650,2,I was stupid enough to want to walk there DONT The road takes you round and round around the tower instead of straight to it Just take the bus there its much easier You can take the bus to the Tower from meongdong The tower itself was very expensive Too expensive So I didnt bother going up there even though it took me an hour and a half to walk there The view from the bottom of the tower was already nice so I didnt want to pay 22000 won to go further up for apparently nothing
3651,4,If you are in Seoul you must visit the tower really good views from the top You can hike up to the tower or take the cable cart to the top Plan for long lines for the cable carts going up and coming back from the tower
3652,4,The view is amazing from the tower where you can the beauty of Seoul Souvenirs shop is located at the top of the tower and also around the entrance along with cafes The entrance also surrounded with art work and greenery view
3653,4,Well nothing much to talk about this placebut the scenery was amazing esp at night I went in Feb this year decided not to take the cable car and climb up to the top with my own footworst decision ever i wish someone would carry me unfortunatelynot be able to find one I dont spend too much time here 1hr is enough because its too crowdedpeople everywhere really hard to find a good spot for me to take a picturesighed But still worth a visit
3654,4,Ive been wanting to come here ever since I first saw that cable car scene from My Lovely Sam Soon and was not disappointed We planned to arrive during sunset and the hotel I was staying is pretty nearby so we decided to walk on over The walk up to the cable car station wasnt bad at all probably because there is this elevatorramp hybrid thing that helps you up this last steep portion The cable cars were really cool to ride in although they do kind of pack you in since there are a lot of people  Once you get to the top you have to climb a few more flights of stairs which isnt bad but may be for those with mobility issues Once you get close to the top you can start to see all the locks of love There were quite a few vendors selling locks so those looking to lock their love last minute dont have to worry The view below the tower is really gorgeous although it was a bit windy when we went There are quite a few restaurantsshops around the bottom of the tower for those who are hungry from the climb  The tower costs an additional extra to go up to and we bought the package deal in which popcorndrinks are included Its funny how they play this scene that youre blasting off to space as you ascend in the elevator Once you get to the top of the tower its pretty much a 360 degree view of Seoul with souvenir shops in the middle I like how on each window it tells you how far you are from a major city in the world and its nice to sit down and chill next to a pretty view   Theres not a wholeee lot to do here besides admiring the scenery but the entire experience was definitely worth it and fun
3655,4,The place is beautiful in the night  it has beautiful views and there is shop were you can buy lock and lock it in place they say it will make your love together  Then you can go up the tower it show the city view and there is restaurant and souvenir  In all its good
3656,5,Twice Ive been there during winter I love walking up the slope and looking at the scenery and how the trees cast shadows on the path Im not sure how itll feel for summer though The wind can be a little too much for winter and high altitude I think u have to go up the tower itself so that you wont get blown away Same I think scenery up the tower is best when you go just before sunset so that you can enjoy 2 different feel
3657,5,We took the bus 2 3 or 5 up to the last stop and walked the rest of the way up to the peak The last stretch is pretty steep to say the least so if you have mobility concerns please check before you turn up We paid 10000 wons each to go up the tower and from you can get a panoramic view of the city Worth the visit  If you have purchased the Tmoney card please note that there are some discount coupons that come in the box and there is a 10 coupon for N Seoul tower
3658,3,There is practically nothing to do once you are up in the building though there are quite a number of activities eg wax museum at the bottom of the tower but you have to pay for it Basically there are only 3 floors accessible for tourists and 2 of them are just restaurants There is practically nothing to do on the top floor which is just souvenirs shops and the view of Seoul
3659,4,Hi all  My guide bring me the first stop is to the seoul tower 3D dimension which was good experience for mine young kids and if I did not recall wrongly which locate on the 2nd floor and the 4th or 5th floor was the open space where many locks was locked on the fences say once u put a lock with the person u loved it will be forever love
3660,5,A must see Make sure you visit in the late afternoon and stay into the night The views are incredible and you wont soon forget your visit
3661,5,Bring you hiking shoes when you visit Seoul A walk up Namsan Mountain to the base of the Seoul Tower is an absolute must Locals of all ages do this hike so do not be intimidated by a little uphill walking Paths are well marked well lit and well maintained Namsan is pretty at anytime of the year but spring and fall are exceptionally stunning At the top the views of Seoul are fantastic I find it really memorable on a clear night This will be one of the highlights of your trip to Seoul
3662,4,On our fist day in Seoul we rode the Seoul City Tour bus to get an overview of the city We got off at the N Seoul Tower to get the panoramic view It really is a fantastic view of Seoul; you really see how huge the city is There were also some cultural events going on touristy but entertaining There were people dressed in traditional clothes performing different acts
3663,4,Went through subway  staircasessss  uphill  cable car It was a winter freezing with the strong wind Otherwise the whole seoul is under the foot Nice place for photo shooting Worth for visiting although is tiring Haha
3664,5,Hit the cable car walk round the summit once then bail  Amazing views inexpensive with a sweet cable ride in  out  Highlights views Lowlights not much education as to why it exists
3665,4,I think going to the N Seoul Tower is a must when in Seoul Unfortunately we walked from the train station to the cable car station so it was quite tiring I had to stop a few times to catch my breath When you get to the cable car station more stairs The cable car is I think W8000 for a round trip ticket This will bring you right up to the platform where you can walk about and this is where lovers leave their locks all along the fence and even on the trees There are restos and coffee shops and also a gift shop To go up the Tower you have to pay an additional amount which I forgot Too bad it was a bit cloudy the day that we went so you couldnt really appreciate the view Still a nice place to go to and include in your itinerary 
3666,4,We opted for walking up to the hill from our guesthouse and ended with the magnificent view of Seoul Worth it
3667,4,This is a great place to go to get oriented on Seoul or go on a romantic stroll The love locks are a nice touch too
3668,3,The tower sits on top of Namsan mountain which is already very high up above the city so I didnt pay to go up the observation deck There are a few free viewing platforms at the base of the tower and the views are superb I came up here via Seoul City Tour bus which I think is great value
3669,5,Great views can get photos done with ticket purchase to observation deck Cute wall where couples people like to lock in there promises Large area where they often put on shows and artists who will sketch a caricature for 15000KRW per person Cable car will transport u to Myeongdong for 6000KRW from the Namsan Not accessible by car From MyeongdongJunggu area take bus 2 or 5
3670,3,You can get the teleferic to get to the top less than 5 minutes or get there walking many stairs be aware Whatever the way you choose you have a view of the city and youre able to get a dinner on the restaurant on the top with such view Apart from that is a simple TV tower nothing special except for the colors which can be viewed in the distance Plenty of padlocks from lovers french bridge style good place to go with your couple
3671,5,Namsan tower is located in the middle of seoul and its the highest place  from it  you can almost see all Seoul from above you can go up  1by bus 2by cable car 3by foot i recommend going there at dawn to see the view in the morning and watch sunset and see the view at night also this place is famous for love locks
3672,3,Only lover locks and the tower itself not attractive enough This place should includes more restaurants and great view and platform for taking photo Maybe some special design structure For young travellors what attract us is nice view and relaxing place If there is some linkages with the hiking trail it would definitely attract young peopel to come who can inject more energy for this place
3673,5,Another of Seouls amazing spots Walk around the tower and get multiple views of the city Take a break at one of their cafes or restaurants which also offer a great view while you eat Leave your mark behind by placing a lock on of the lock trees or fences
3674,2,Packed up with tourist expensive everything lots of queuing and too commercial Ok young couples might enjoy this thing but for others I wouldnt suggest The view was nice for sure but overall experience was a bit lame
3675,4,Spectacular view of Seoul from a tower on top of a mountain Very touristy yet worthwhile Go on a clear day for best views
3676,5,Entrance fee was pretty expensive therefore we finally decided to stay just under the tower but even from here the view to Seoul was amazing and we enjoyed time spent there
3677,5,Its my second time in South Korea and I couldnt resist going back here The view is priceless you have no idea that Seoul itself its sooooooooo huge Youll love all the restaurants and things to shop up there
3678,5,Been up twice now The second time the clouds got in the way but this is rare The restaurant is really good and not bad value given the context
3679,5,It was fun to see all of the love locks that couples had left in this place And the views were great Lots of people though
3680,4,This attraction isnt the cheapest in Seoul but its definitely good if you want great views of Seoul The first time I went it was foggy and I couldnt really see much so they give me a ticket to go back This was good for me because I was in Korea for a year but not so good if you are only there for a short period of time So its definitely worth checking the weather before going Ive been both day and night time During the day its a nice walk through Namsan Park up to the tower and there was different games and activities going on outside of the tower On the night time the tower is lit up and the views from the top were amazing So it really just depends what you want to see Ive walked up and took the cable car The walk was nice but can take a while so again it depends if you like the walk or just want to see the tower The restaurant in the tower is nice and you can get a combo ticket for a meal and entry but it is also very expensive Theres a gift shop in the tower also
3681,4,This is totally worth your time You get to see the whole city by just going to the top of this towerThe elevator ride is already an attraction
3682,5,Seoul tower was amazing The views were great and there was so much to do inside the tower like take fun pictures eat and of course shop The hike to the tower was fun although tiring for those not in the best shape but worth it
3683,4,Nice setting especially as the sun is setting It was snowing the day I went and the incline car couldnt operate so there were quite a few stairs to climb to get to the cable car Then after cable car you go to the tower to go up Give yourself plenty of time  this is not something like many towers Ive been to where you walk up go in an elevator Youll spend at least 30 minutes just getting to the base of the tower
3684,5,See the city at nightr type lift takes you up to top of the mountain lots of history there both recent and past The views were great Lots of locals Some neat traditions for those in love If you climb it it will take a while and allot of steps
3685,5,I visited the N Seoul Tower on Monday so it was less crowded and you dont have to get in queue to get into the top of the tower It has a lot of cute souvenirs too that cant be found in other place so I suggest you to buy something in here
3686,2,We didnt feel much great here Its like normal mountain where you can find city view Its not unique things for sure I think its suitable for couples
3687,4,Very Cold Very Nice View Very Relaxing Very nie to walk around and drink coffee Very nice to see happy people with happy faces 
3688,4,You get dropped off at the bottom of the towel and have to take a very steep 10mins ish walk up a hill but once youre up there the view is beautiful You can also pay to go up to the top of the tower
3689,4,Here is like an exercise weekend place 30 seconds elevator up to the viewing deck nice experience but no nice pictures for me
3690,5,The tower and location on top of the mountain offers amazing views of the Seoul from every angle I went in Feb and it was chilly but the walkhike up to the viewing sites warmed us up I would recommend going in the late afternoon so you can see the city in the daylight and night There are several eateries if you get hungry and lots of snack food you can buy as well There is an area where lovers can put their locks on the gate I would buy your locks and bring them before you come if you plan on doing this Locks at the gift shop might set you back a small fortune Ha Overall I enjoyed my time here I am glad that we added this activity to our site seeing agenda If you go to Seoul its just one of those things that you should do
3691,3,The views were good and the facilities  restrooms eatingdining were good and theres a plaza that is currently being constructed I enjoyed the view from the top  however it wasnt that much better than the view from the hill so Im not sure it justified the price tag
3692,4,We visit this place at mid FEb 16 which is the weather is chill For visiting this place from Myeongdong station take exit 3 and find bus stop Take bus 05 to Namsan Tower it takes around 15 minutes of ride by bus This place is have TV Tower and lock loves wall So if you believe then prepare your lock to hang on the wall Also from this place you can see Seoul city It is free unless you want to enter and take the elevator to the Seoul Tower
3693,4,Going here last April 2015 So many people came here just to looked at the famous Love Lock So glad to be here ;
3694,4,Great view from the top of the N Seoul tower you can see the entire Seoul city view Nice view inside the cable car on the way to the tower
3695,3,The slope was quite steep not recommended for people with weak legs Cabs are not allow to go up hence we change to bus at the foot of the tower
3696,4,Make the climb up the short hill to the top where the tower is Take some time and enjoy a coffee or even an ice cream Take in the scene and place a lock on the fence to create a lasting memory
3697,5,Get to the top of Seoul namsan tower for a romantic moment Dont forget to bring along with a lock of forever love for a couple
3698,5,I once visited this place with my father and siblings Being here was so pleasant and fun Me and my siblings had so much fun This place reminds me of the time I had with my family
3699,4,A 15minute walk through the park to the tower landing awards the traveler with a picturesque boardwalk covered in love locks  The tower itself provides and expansive view of the city from the sky
3700,5,if you want a 360 degrees view of the city it is worth a visit the observation deck would give you a glimpse of the massive development of seoul as a extremely develop state
3701,4,I love the idea of keylocks its so amazing coz its shows how many million couples got there to locked their love for each other Heard from sayings about the locks meaning the view at the top is so refreshings and relaxing
3702,5,We took cabel car to the top of the tower and public bus back to the city The view of the city is very beautiful
3703,5,Yesterday i decided to do some tourist life stuff around Seoul The tower is one of the most ideal places for that Many people walk up to the tour while others like myself take the cable cars to the top of the base of the tower before taking the elevator to the top The views were just astounding Being able to see all the cities and buildings and then the mountains in the background There were also plenty of couple things to do as Korea is big on couple promotions There are thousands of locks down on the base near the tower for couples promoting their everlasting love to one another It was cute
3704,3,Seouls north tower on Namsan mountain makes a pleasant excursion during the day or at dusk It gives an excellent view of the whole ugly sprawling city spread over the mountains and down to the river with clear information displays and some restaurants too But although the crowds were not that substantial it is nothing that special  until you compare it to any of the other attractions in Seoul We caught the metro from our hotel to Chungmuro station on the orange line and then just outside caught a bus number 2 or 5 which run frequently up to the tower Dont try to walk  it could take you an hour
3705,3,fun short cable car ride to reach tower in centre of lovely park with good walks never feels crowded
3706,5,N Seoul Tower is a must visit if you want to have a glance the whole of Seoul Best way to enjoy this scenery is to dine at restaurants at the tower Is a breathe taking view from high above be it day or night time
3707,5,Take the cable car to see the whole city from different perspective Take the bus the way going down or walk if weather supports will be another great thing to do especially in late afternoon
3708,4,Must definitely stay until late night and look at the night view Breathtaking views of Seoul  But it was crowded haha And too bad we didnt get to visit the museum because it moved to some other place We took so many photos when we got up to the tower
3709,5,If you stay in Seoul you can see the great view of whole city at the N Seoul tower There are many ways to go up there On warm days you can hike slowly from the subway station watching the walls and trees In winter you had better take the cable car You also see the wonderful scenery of the Seoul night  In April the best thing at Namsan is walking through the cherryblossomtunnel
3710,3,Its the iconic landmark in Seoul Best view during night time for the panoramic view of the city skyline Ride the cable car if you opt for a more comfy experience
3711,4,This is a nice place to spend some time Great spot for people watching on top of the mountain There are places to leave love locks if that is your thing Nice views of the city Well worth the price of admission
3712,5,If you want an amazing view of Seoul city this is a must Take the cable car up around dusk You can then compare the city in the day time and then see all of the beautiful lights of the city
3713,4,When you reached to the N Tower it got a very nice view A beautiful place to dine too You have options what to eat The food price is quite expensive but if you want to splurge a little bit for a good view then it will be worth it  Going there we go via metro and walked to the cable car station It was a long uphill walk If one is not use to walking it will be tiring But once you are in the cable car the view is magnificent It will be worth the walk
3714,3,We decided to take the cable car up and walk down This was indeed the correct decision If you decide to walk up be prepared for a tough climb There was a 30 minute queue for the cable car and we were jammed into the car like sardines but still it got us up to the tower OK and without breaking a sweat  At the tower we were a bit confused about which ticket to buy There was the observation tower and a combined Tower and Pavilion ticket but it was not clear what the Pavilion actually was Finally we bought a beer package which was access to the observation tower for 2 persons and a beer each for 26000 in total Not bad considering the tower alone would have been 20000 cheapest beer we had in Seoul ha ha You need to collect your beer though before you take the elevator to the top  The views are pretty average Its not like the Eiffel tower where you are looking down on so many historic places Here you pretty much just see a concrete jungle  When we came down we bought a lock and wrote our message on it and hung it on the fence Kind of quirky but we enjoyed it Finally we walked down to the bottom which is very enjoyable and recommended
3715,4,from above you will be able to see the beautiful seoul we went there at night and it is really beautiful this place is good for lovers make sure to lock you love and promises 
3716,4,We have been there in winter time in the evening So there were less people then expected The staff is very friendly like everywhere in Seoul You can choose to go up the hill by cable car But I guess you can also walk Later it is queuing again for the tower ticket Inked the tower it is quite empty only candy shops
3717,5,i have visit with my boyfriend to seoul tower we plane go up via stair can you believe it;s really very good fist i think very difical but it is not when you date with your love it is good for talk
3718,4,This is a Famous Tourist Object at the center of seoul Here we can go up at the tower and see the view of seoul city but another one that also famous is the Lock Love Key at the same location at the n seoul tower Ground floor Here we can put a lock and put name of our couple and throw it away the key and most people believe their love will be eternal 
3719,4,Most breathtaking views from the top of this Tower The surroundings were stunning with line of trees at the roadside I can imagine how beautiful it is in summer time
3720,3,The special thing is lover locker I have buy 01 locker 10000won Dont have many restaurant here The burger is very good cost about 750012000 won
3721,4,very nice place to visit but weirdly expensive  first you pay for the gondola up and then you need to buy tickets for the elevator to the top  dont get the set popcorn drink and ticket  not worth it Beautiful views of Seoul Dress warmly  very windy at top
3722,4,this attraction is kids friendly suitable for the whole family thus is taks some time if you start by the cable car the line for it was 60 minutes in the tower you can have some lunch the view from the top is awesome great all around seoul a nice half day in seoul
3723,5,The sunset view is So Beautiful Make sure you bring your loved one to enjoy it D After sunset you can also enjoy the city night view from Aboveand it was amazing
3724,5,When you are in the bus going to the top of the mountain you see the city When you arrive there the weather is colder but you can see the hole city and the tower is vrry beautiful
3725,5,Namsan Tower is a beautiful place to view the entire Seoul City But it is also the best place to experience romantic feels for lovers You can see love locks and photo shoot spots for lovers anywhere around the area It is so romantic that love songs can be heard in the background You will definitely bring back the spark between you and your lover when you both visit Namsan Tower together
3726,3,Go here and experience the fantastic view It is defiantly worth it But dont go up in the tower the view is amazing but the long line and all the people are not worth it There are only Windows to look through and they are full with peoples fingerprints and so on The view is good enough from the mountain
3727,4,I deduct one star because of the wait To get up to the tower took us about 3 hours It was a 5 hour trip total Once youre up to the mountain theres more waiting but the views are totally worth it It costs about 17000 wan to ride the cable car then 20000 for the observation deck which you buy after reaching the top of the mountain via cable car Theres plenty to see on the mountain top but even more inside the tower Just make sure you have time It was a neat experience especially for my 1st Korea trip
3728,4,Enjoyed a late night outing up the cable car during a light snow The snow unfortunately limited our visibility of the city below but it was still beautiful and very romantic We ate some fish and chips at the top a nice surprise and came down on the last cable car of the night around 11pm
3729,4,very pretty location and snowy  waterfalls hard freeze leaves that were still frozen existing outlets for souvenirs  on which you want to buy a lock to be hung on the iron are encouraged to make as a couple  very nice atmosphere
3730,5,This is the perfect place to go for a panarama view of Seoul It is especially nice on a clear day This is a fun activity for all ages
3731,3,Ticket for the N Seoul tower observatory costs 9000 won per adult but if you purchase the promo of 2 tix with popcorn and soda at 20000 won it will be better Believe me ; It comes with 1 bucket size popcorn any flavor as long as available plus 2 large sodas Picture below This is a typical tower that offers 360view of a city Good for experience and since youre already in Seoul Hike is tiring if youre not used to it but view going up is relaxing you can try the cable car if you want We did not bus going to N Seoul foot and just try our luck and walk our way from Seoul station going here We felt getting lost at some point but you can always see the tower and you can rely on google maps so if youre up for a little adventure you can do this too Didnt try the Alive teddy bear museum but some say its good especially if you want to learn moer of Koreas history
3732,4,we walk from Myeongdong to N Seoul Tower and we didnt use cable car if you have time i recommend you to walk to the top of tower youll got a nice view the weather is so nice just walk around and enjoy to take a photo
3733,3,We missed one stop when travelling to myeongdong and stop at the university stop just so happen there was an indication to the tower by bus which took us ten minutes to reach the tower After reading the reviews at tripadviser we decided not to pay to go up the tower One floor down the tower has a newly opened LG display of their 3D TV screen pretty awesome and free of charge the display movie lasts two minutes It is nice to view seoul at a height with a panorama view anyway
3734,5,It was nice to take a short time to climb up Considering it being weekend it was not that bad Waited for some time to get the ride to the top then it was too cloudy to see anything Still great place for Seoul
3735,5,Perfect place to go if the visibility is good Dont miss the ice cream place the restaurant and take tons of pictures No need to go up in the tower The view from the bottom is already astonishing
3736,5,if u from nandemun or myeondong juz take the bus and ask themdont take taxiits very easy to go to n seoul tower and u will get nice view especially when u travel in autumn
3737,5,Take the bus heresome people dont and it was quite a long walk The view from the top is beautifulyou can see the entire city and with it all lit up is just a bonus
3738,4,Great view and environment for family and friends besides great to view part of Seoul city with 360 view
3739,4,The tower is a definite go to place whilst visiting Seoul The city is not the best looking but you certainly get a scope of how big it is There is also the usual souvenir shops and food and drink stalls
3740,5,Seoul tower is very nice and famous here in Seoul You can go there by walk or by ropeway lifts are there to go on the top of the tower at the top all directions are identified by name of cities in that direction nice 360 degree view on the top
3741,5,It is easy to get to N Seoul Tower travelled by train forgot the station name Tourist Information is very helpful if you ask them It is a beautiful place very scenic I think everyone who visits Seoul should go to Remember to have your camera I recommend this for anyone however for those with leg problem they can only stay around Seoul Tower as the staircase is very very long to get to the top to look at the love lock We had a great time there and took lots of pictures My family and I enjoyed it very much despite the bitter winter
3742,5,We went to Namsan Tower at night by cablecar what a wonderful view of Seoul city Lots of young people taking pics of themselves and others by the many fences and iron shapes covered with thousands of locks dedicated with their loves name Several restaurants at base of Tower and gift shop The view from base of Tower is breathtaking we didnt get to the top of Tower due to circumstances but I wish we had A must see
3743,4,We visited Seoul Tower on the day of chuseok major harvest festival 2015 We did not plan but the day was 27th October supermoon We reached there by bus from Chungmuro station The bus was over crowded We reached and saw a big croud towards Seoul Tower  It remind me of Durga Puja in my hometown Kolkata I was a bit disappointed Then we reached the tower by walking  I want to visit again by cable car or by hiking through Namsin Tower  It was a huge queue in front of the ticket counter anyhow we took a ticket for Alive museum and the tower observatory We entered the alive museum and our mood changed totally The alive museum might look childish to most of us I also thought in the beginning But I bet everyone will enjoy this museum After that we reached the observatory  I was almost the time of sunset We saw the entire city It looked amazing We stayed there for almost one and half hours and enjoyed the scenes outside The city of Seoul at night with supermoon is a lifetime experience to me The traffic on the both sides of Han river looks like golden necklace  Its worth visiting Seoul tower at night But I will try to visit Seoul Tower in a weekday when there will be a little crowd
3744,5,Beautiful city lights from the top A romantic and quiet place for couples Buy a ticket up popcorn and drink to enjoy romantic times with your love ones
3745,5,Very expensive to go upto the top The restaurant is even more expensivebut worth one time visit You get to see the whole city
3746,4,We went there on the afternoon so sadly we couldnt see the lamp at night But overall it was nice to see the icon of South Korea and see many love locks there and the story behind it  Definitely a mustvisit in Seoul
3747,5,A great place for friends and family Take the cable car up and you will reach the base of the tower There are tonnes of thing to do there You can put love locks you can shop for souvenirs and even beauty products Grab a cup of coffee on your way up the tower You go up by taking a lift which is 200 ft above ground There will be an animation to watch above your head as you reach the top The view is incredible There will be gift shops and cafe at the observatory tower There is also a restaurant and bear museum right below it Lots of things to see and experience Definitely a mustgo place 
3748,5,Took the cable car up to the base of the tower The ride up was very scenic See the view of city once you arrive the base of seoul tower Souveniers shopping coffee and light food is available Love locks can also be purchase here
3749,4,The hike up to the N Seoul Tower was lovely there are several ways you csn make your way up from steep stairs or winding trails When you get to the top you get a fantastic view of Seoul from every angle I would definitely recommend going here while staying in Seoul
3750,5,Ive been here in early January and if u r asking yes its freezing up there it is a perfect place for you to visit with your love ones wife or girlfriendboyfriend I would suggest you bring your own padlock as it comes by cheaper than the ones theyre selling up here which is about 8000 won each However from my last visir here in 2013 ive locked my padlock at the love lock gate but when I came earlier this year it was gone most probably cut When my friend have a conversation with the coffee shop worker there he said the worker there cut some padlocks every other year in order to make space for new ones to bet put I noticed the ones left there are quite old as they are very rusty my assumption is maybe they left the old rusty ones as a symbol of everlasting love dont judge me here Im only assuming lol So basically its a must visit place if you are in Seoul and the night view is fantastic as it is filled with lights Be warned if you are visiting in DecemberJanuary season do wear layers and layers of clothes
3751,5,The cable car price is only 8500won and the entrance to the observatory is 10000 won The price is still of good price and not pricey The N seoul tower is only 1015 minutes walk from Myeongdong The elevator to go up is free which is fascinating I love the view when I am on the observatory The view is indeed breathtaking I would love to try to be here on night time for next time I visit Seoul
3752,4,It is a great place to visit in the evening time because of the view and the lights you can see The tower is nice and worth a visit Bring someone who knows Seoul and you will understand more about Seoul A good place that you should check out
3753,5,Been only in the restaurant in the morning The food was way too expensive The restaurant was going around showing Seoul However in Seoul there honestly isnt a nice scenery that I enjoyed because all I saw was chaotic building and streets not my favorite
3754,5,This place has an amazing view of Seoul city situated on a hill Highly recommend to come here during evening so you can catch the sunset and after that watch the city light up The tower itself also lights up at night giving it a beautiful view An attraction not to be missed
3755,5,Best point of view in Seoul A lots of keys that people come here for chain their destiny If you didnt come here with your soulmate or your lover like me Dont be sorry hahaha Because just come here for looking at the view of Seoul Thats very good for here
3756,5,One of the best spots in Seoul Really amazing views of the city Better visit early morning to avoid crowds and waiting time A must place to visit
3757,5,Visited twice 1st time went up with bus  2nd time went up with cable car The view is beautiful Love this place so much
3758,5,Check this out for spectacular views of the city We took the cable car  to the top but if the weather was warmer I would have taken the hike The elevator to the top is another fee but worth it for the view
3759,4,We were very fortunate that on the night that we arrived 2nd December 2015 it started snowing and continued with greater intensity the next morning And so most of Namsan was covered with snow when we went there around midday on 3rd Dec From the tower one could see snow cover all around Seoul too
3760,5,This was a great day out with a young baby Heaps of great food options to get out of the cold The views were amazing and even though there was a lot of people it didnt feel busy
3761,4,If you want to go up to the observatory youd better reach N Seoul Tower before 4 pm Depending on the date you may be waiting for 23 hours and you can identify buildings before sundown Sometimes its hard to see things at night  Sometimes not that often there are events such as folk performances fireworks and so on If its onceinalife visit youd better check the website  As of Dec 2015 N Seoul Tower Plaza is opened Its a connected shopping mall with some exhibition area and restaurants You can spend some more time there  There are several routes to head N Seoul Tower As well as subway and taxi arent around there are just a few ways to take you there You may waste time finding bus stops or ropeway Therefore if time is enough for healthy travelers I recommend to take a walk from the Namsan Library It takes about 3050 min from there  Bus Bus stops are from the northeast way and this is one way road Ropewaycable car Better to purchase a roundtrip ticket Trekking starting from Baekbeom Park Namsan Library Hayatt Hotel and more
3762,4,The tower is a nice tourist destination with stores and restaurants in and around it to visit Once on the observation level you can see the whole city very well On the weekends beside the tower you can see traditional performances of music and weaponry which are great There is a bit of steep uphill walking to get to the tower even if you take the cable car but its worth it
3763,4,N Seoul Tower is the peak of Namsan It is best visited at night for a night view of Seoul Entrance to the observation deck is chargeable and is separated from the cable car ride ticket
3764,5,I have visited so many Towers but this was Something unique Best part was LOVE LOCK PLACE on Tower  It was a amazing feeling I was speechless
3765,5,You can see the big city up there There are many locks showing lovers bond and promises I loved the beer at the lounge
3766,4,accessibility  good we went there via public bus view  good if you want to have a panoramic view of Seoul this is a good place to go  dont forget to go up the love lock area and take a picture of the broken chair
3767,5,Thought this would be a bit ho hum but its definitely worth a look see They have singing there on a big screen and take a love lock with you to add to the thousands of others there
3768,5,The views of the city are beautiful  there is some space for kids to roam around We have visited in the daytime it was foggy but we could still see well and we have also visited at night which offers its own beautiful view of Seoul The gift shop has fun little souvenirs Get directions on taking the bus here It is much easier especially when visiting with children The tram is fun but too much waiting  walking so we prefer the bus 
3769,5,Busy with long wait times for the lifts but so so worth it to see the views of Seoul Simply stunning and if you visit Seoul make sure you dont miss out Check the weather though and make sure you have a clear evening
3770,5,You can see seoul city On top of the tower is just amazing You can see the district and the towns Over all its wonderful
3771,5,N Seoul Tower is the highest point and offers beautiful views You can go up to the top of the tower for a fee but we didnt We were high enough to enjoy the beautiful views and take some great pictures  This place is well known from a K drama I personally love the cheesy romance of putting a love lock with my husband They sell pretty locks there for about 56USD that come with a marker pen so you can write on your lock before you attach it to a rail or love tree On the day we went the skies were clear and there was a free performance going on They do offer food lots of photo opportunities and a nice way to enjoy a free tourist site  You can either take a bus or the tram Taxis are not allowed due to government restrictions trying to reduce air pollution If you take the tram just a block over is the famous donkatsu block Huge servings of donkatsu and all the restaurants are good Have fun
3772,4,Ive been to Seoul multiple times but never made it up to the tower until this last visit It was pretty much what I expected def not lacking on cheesytourist standstchotchkes but Im giving it 4 stars still because of the absolutely gorgeous views of Seoul They even have little map lines on the windows so you can see what neighborhoods youre looking at Plus you blast off to space in the elevator which is pretty hilarious and awesome  Just for the views alone Id recommend everyone going at least once
3773,5,Grab some souvenirs and make sure to bring a lock if you are a couple The place is absolutely stunning worth the whole afternoon just walking around and exploring
3774,5,You can see Seoul from top of N Tower also there are lots of love padlock hanging on the iron wire and trees Bring your loved ones and write your name and your lover name on the love padlock
3775,5,Very easy to get there by a shuttle bus at only a dollar amount but you will see a stunning view although we dont go up to the observatory Especially the night view is very breathtakingand when you get down by a cable car there are many restaurants you can try a pork cutlet cheap but yummy ;
3776,5,Seoul tower is a must visit place in korea too Accessible through cab  car or through the cable car this is a famous location for kdramas and kmovies It has the love locks and very popularly visited by new lovers as they have a place to place locks with their names written on it The night view from the place is very nice too We went there on Nov 2014 and it so happened they projected  3d mapped some presentation traditional drums i believe on the tower It was really cool to watch
3777,5,The view while waiting is already amazing and from up here it is simply mesmerizing A must do in Seoul
3778,3,Great thing about N Seoul Towernice view many locks around the tower and great restaurants around there  The worse there is ONLY ONE lift to the restaurants and not the tower with locks I saw parent has to carry their baby stroller to the upper level in order the catch the night view
3779,5,We took the Cable Car up to the mountain then the elevator up to the observation deck You are asked to look up in the elevator and watch a corny spectacle on a TV above you and are told that it takes 30 seconds to the top Nice view Best to go on a clear day when there is not much fog Very people with a lot of people
3780,4,Nothing special really but if you like city views this is the place to go 360 degree view of Seoul We went at night and the view was amazing There is even a restaurant and gift shop
3781,5,N Seoul Tower is definitely one of the most recognizable places in Seoul and is worth visiting  You can take a mountain trail fromto N Tower or a Namsan Cable Car There are many attractions from obvious things like souvenir shopping restaurants and park to visiting Alive Museum or going to Observatory  You can buy several different ticket packages  we have bought combine ticket for Alive Museum and Observatory and it was worth Even the elevator ride to the Observatory is an attraction as you feel you are riding to the sky  Only thing that made a little bad impression on me is then you are going to the elevator there is a narrow corridor and to pass it you are forced to make a photo you got a number and later on top you can get your photo for 10000 wons 10  ofc you are not really forced to buy it but it may feel a little bit as pulling tourists to spend more money on top of ticket prize
3782,4,I think that Namsan is a must if your coming to Seoul When you think of going to Namsan you may think about taking about the cable car but Im going to tell you that taking the walk up is WAY MUCH BETTER Not only do you have to wait in a line to ride the cable car and pay the fee you wont be able to see the amazing view you could have seen by walking up the mountain trail When you get to the top of the mountain youll see a lot of people and Namsan Tower Although there are a lot of tourist you can also see a lot of locals There were also a lot of locals and a LOT of couples After looking at some souvenirs I waited in a long long line But it was worth the wait  Looking at Seouls night view was fun and I even got to send a post card to my family from the observatory
3783,5,We visited night time in Seoul tower There are so many people and we waited so long But this tower is nice and night view was beautiful
3784,4,This tower is significantly enhanced by its location atop a large green and wooded hill in North Seoul The area around the tower has the usual fast food and drinks stands but crucially has a large open square which is used to stage regular entertainment and cultural events We found this more interesting than going up the tower itself
3785,5,I love traveling its like my happy pill And South Korea is my happy pill I love the weather Be prepared going up for you knee might surrender and you just wanna lay on the road Go there at night to see the Namsan skyline I love Seoul
3786,4,There are some places in every major city that you just HAVE to go to Sometimes these places are a bit underwhelming I would not consider N Seoul Tower Formerly Namseun Tower underwhelming The views were spectacular the love locks were heartwarming and given that I was visiting during the holiday season the decor was particularly enthralling  Though not the tallest tower Ive been in it still captivates you as the tower sits on the highest point in the city From the observation deck you get an even better view of gorgeous Seoul  the foliage and gazebos were also delightful to walk through and sit near and the balconies were lovely to gaze from  Come with your significant other It makes the visit all the more special
3787,4,We were looking for cable car to go up but didnt manage to find it and we end up climbing hundreds of stairs to reach all the way up there Ok this could be a romantic place for couples but because of us are female there wasnt any romantic part up there But hey it was still nice to see those couples travelled all the way there to put up their love lock I will do it with my future husband the next time I travel there again The view from top was magnificent Love the experience there
3788,4,Im not sure if this is norm but when we went on 26 December it took close to 2 hours to reach the tower Had to brave the cold 6deg and queue Was hoping to get a day and night shot but by the time we got up it was already dark Lovely views of Seoul city nonetheless Staff handled the crowd well The walk to and fro Myeongdong was a good exercise
3789,4,nice experience up the n seoul tower at night It was showing on the night we went up Take note of the slippery steps The pork cutlet curry rice near the cable car tower is excellent Generous portion
3790,5,If youre travelling in couple bring your own padlock instead of buying it there Its way too expensive Try to find a lift that brings you directly to the entrance of cable car 8500 won for Adult Overall beautiful scenery up there
3791,4,We visited N Seoul Tower at the end of a gray day so the views were compromised; however we had a blast The best fun was the ride up in the cable car It started snowing and this was quite beautiful As it was a bit dark out the views werent much and the tower itself pales a bit compared to Taipei 101 or the Tokyo Tower but it is still fun just a bit touristy The coup was in walking down through the park This was a joy and perhaps the most fun of the trip The tower I could take or leave but the fun of wandering down from it was relaxing and fun
3792,4,This place offers nice city views  Unfortunately the weather wasnt perfect But still the view was nice and you can have a good overview of Seoul  Theres a skyride to the top which makes the access easy I walked down afterwards and this can be easily done as long as you dont mind walking
3793,3,At night by the tour bus they gave us just 15 min to see the tower and Picture it i was dissapointed that it didnt include a visit inside and up the tower So busy spot at night with people doing sports around
3794,5,We truly enjoy hiking to the top of Namsan to the tower It is a good climb and we finish it off with a churro and ice cream or a burger As you are climbing cut off the main trail and onto the smaller trails through the trees It is steeper but much faster and more fun
3795,4,Wonderful hiking trail up the Namsan mountain Do remember to stay till the evening for the laser show while coming down take the cable car if you are tired If you are adventurous enough try carrying your girlfriend up the trail It will fetch you decent brownie points  Jokes apart on top of the TV tower do remember to look out for the distances to major cities around the world
3796,3,After a long hike then more than an hour queueing for cable car finally we reached the tower Choices of cafes and restaurant are there and also the love locks Need to wait about half an hour to go up and before we enter the elevator photograph is taken and ready when reached the observatory deck Worth to visit unfortunately the windows was not clean enough to view the city during the evening either its or because of smog
3797,4,Its definitely worth a trip Its all touristy but interesting with the love locks and all The love locks are overpriced but its still worth the experience
3798,5,after the long subway ride then the long hike up the hill to the skycar it is worth every step When you reach the top of course it is expensive but that leave you no reason to complain at least when you buy your ticket to the top of the tower you can also order popcorn and a drink DO IT
3799,5,This is the place to go if you want to appreciate how large Seoul is We took a subway and walked up a steep hill to get to the place where you get on the cable car I think theres a bus that goes up there though  There were many many people there and they pack you in like sardines on the cable car that goes up to the tower but once youre there you have the chance to spread out a bit The views are absolutely worth the trip  If you can time the trip with sunset you will not be disappointed We got to see the sun set over the city and then took pictures with the city lights coming on Just beautiful
3800,4,It depends on you like to visit during daytine or night time I can say there is a better view if you visit daytime but well night time view will be romantic as the beautiful lighting decoration And here famous for the love lockpad for couples Buy a love lock with Won2500 for your love
3801,5,This is my 3rd trip to seoul and also my 3rd trip to namsan tower Even though i know its crowded the long que for cable car i just feel doesnt right if i didnt go here Watching the sunset on Namsan Tower and waiting for the lights go up is definitely one of the best experience And bring your locks for the fun of it but the next time you visited this place dun expect to find the locks at where it was Thats what happened to me  Still missing this place Perfect for couple to confess your undying love here The setting are just so romantic
3802,4,One of the mustgo in Seoul Suitable for couples Nice night view But be careful that it will be terribly cold during winter Better visit in Spring and Autumn
3803,5,If you want to see Seoul in one view this is the place Its also a nice place for a panoramic shot in your smart phone
3804,3,I walked up to the tower there are 2 walking paths You should be in good shape to take this on It is a LONG WALK of over 2 miles uphill if you take the subway and then walk up I think the best way to see this would be to take a taxi to the lift and ride the cablelift up and back  Once you are up there it is a nice view You can eat take pictures and buy souvenirs
3805,5,We took the elevator up to the tower as it was a cold day Very worth the price Make sure you ride to the top Great views Even though it was foggy on day of our visit If you bring your own lock for tree padlock you could save a bit of money Do not miss this site
3806,4,It is like Seoul symbol so of course you should visit You can see the whole city from up here buy souvenirs and if you come with your lover you two can buy a lock and add to the towers collection 
3807,5,Had a good time with the wife and I exploring some of the night life here in Seoul The light of the holidays were a good touch and the crowdsof people made it fun The cable car was pretty fun tour also I would go back
3808,4,I believe that 95 tourist visiting Seoul will come to this place This place is just the trademark of Seoul if I might say I visited N Seoul Tower on May 2015 it was actually spring but the cherry blossom has already fallen so all I can see was just green leaves but its still beautiful tho To reach this place you can walk not really recommended taking bus or taking cable car I tried the last 2 and I might say that taking bus is a better choice You can see the view outside your bus window and its waaaay cheaper than just taking cable car which I found a bit overprice  When youre arriving in N Seoul Tower make sure you enjoy all the views because its really breathtaking during both day or night Too bad when I came here its started to rain after night came This place brings romantic feeling and I think you should visit the observatory when youre on your 1st visit dont forget to download discount coupon from visitkorea website
3809,4,Taking 2 short buses will take you to a so beautiful walk to the Tower It has a little garden a pavilion a place full of locks for lovers I love their little garden bus waiting areas and the Tower  though not elegant as the Eiffel  it is one of the socalled symbol of the nation The night lighting is gorgeous  Its worth a visit
3810,4,Wasnt sure we would go but it was on our daughters list so headed off there Pleased we did with cable cars viewing platforms sweet shops and other attractions became a good day out for us
3811,4,It seems like a tower like this is a standard thing for lots of cities nowadays The view is very good especially during sunset snow sometimes or other random times The price isnt cheap but nothing this high in the sky is The worst thing is just how busy it can be at times but it seems difficult to predict really Ive been 3 or 4 times and the wait has ranged from 15 hours to nothing So be prepared for a bit of a wait but you will have a great view of the city  The cable car is necessary for anyone not wanting to do quite the hike So if anyone in your group has any difficulty whatsoever with walking uphill for quite a while pay for the cable car
3812,4,Went up the observatory of the N Seoul Tower to show the kids We got the combi ticket for both N Seoul observatory and Alive Museum The kids had more fun in the museum than the observatory Once you see them you seen em all i guess I bought a postcard and mailed it to a friend from up there They have the postbox there and sell postcards already with stamps
3813,4,There are only three ways to get there public bus walk or cable car For bus you can start at Itaewon Station subway line 6 use exit 4 and take bus 3 to N Seoul Tower Its a short ride The cable requires one to travel to the starting point which I dont think is worth the cost to ride The cheapest method is to walk up the hill using the numerous paths up to the top dont do this if youre not in good shape Food is available but for a price Might be a bit steep to some The restaurant on top of the tower requires a reservation
3814,4,A recommended place to visit if you would like to get a good view of the city Perhaps it was due to the nice winter weather but we thought that there is a certain romantic feeling about the place Here is a tip if you would like to save on the cable car ride you can catch a bus from the city eg Namdaemun to the cable car station for less than a third of the price
3815,5,On a cold foggy yet partially sunny Sunday in deep midwinter in Seoul I ventured off in a bus with my local friend to the Namsan Seoul Tower one of the landmarks overlooking the metropolis that is Seoul The crowds were busy but with no queue going up the tower Having waved to King Kong who was resting on the lower side of the Tower we were whizzed up to about level 70 and stunning views over Seoul The views were excellent and the viewing deck had clear floor to ceiling windows for fantastic views Afterwards we enjoyed a traditional warrior dance routine on the forecourt while taking in a beer and pop corn part of the ticket price And following that famous Parisian Bridge over the Seine there are balconies full of padlocks were distant lovers and locals have left their hearts in Seoul A great spot and one not to be missed as busses regularly took you up and down the Mountain to Seoul central Or in spring and autumn the walk down the hill takes in numerous looking points and the park itself
3816,3,We went there but it was extremely crowded due to Christmas There were some shops and all shops are also crowded Tried to go to the tower but as the waiting line was about 1 hour I decided not to go to the top
3817,4,Namsan Tower is smack dab in the middle of Seoul and thus is a very fine spot to view the majestic skyline that is the mega city of Seoul Now there are a few ways to get to the tower each as its own lure I took the city bus as its cheap and frequent You can also take a cable car and that was enticing but cost three almost four times more than the bus The cable car would be good for less able bodied people The bus drops you off and you have a short steep strollhike up the last bit of road to the tower itself And if you like popcorn and soda get the couples set as its only 1000won more and you get snacks
3818,3,Normally Im a huge fan of towers mountains and any place with a great view When I came here it was so misty you could see nothing from the windows  though the mist was at the level of the top of the tower so no one realised this beforehand I feel like the ethical thing for the operators to do would be to warn visitors instead of just taking our money only for us to come straight back down  That said the walk up the hill to the tower was lovely and serene There is a lively atmosphere and it is quite a romantic spot The bus to get there and back is a little confusing but manageable
3819,5,Visited during the night on my birthday when you go up via the lift you are transported to the 360o deck and can view the city of Seoul light up at night
3820,5,We was there the next day after the snow the mountain was fill with snow The view from the cable car was beautifully after the snow You dont have to get to the top of the tower because the view from where the cable car stop is more then enough for you to take the beautiful picture of the tower and the surrounding garden
3821,5,Ive been a number of times to the Seoul Tower and each time it has been a brilliant experience It is best experienced around dusk where the lights of the city begin to illuminate the vast metropolis of Seoul  In addition to the tower there is a lovely couples section where you can attach padlocks with personalised messages written onto them Of course being a couple we opted to do this There are also a number of bars and eateries situated around the base of the tower as well as a restaurant located just beneath the observatory deck  An absolute must visit for anyone visiting Korea
3822,3,We went there on Sunday night theres a long queue If you plan to eat at the revolving restaurant such as N Grill please make reservation as these restaurants are very popular
3823,4,Seoul Tower is one of the major tourist attractions in Seoul You can experience a panorama view of the city and also enjoy the famous lovers lock for some good photo opportunities The Italian restaurant located in the tower vicinity is also quite good for any hungry visitors
3824,3,So first of all let me start off by saying that I believe this place is well worth a visit However my experience left a lot to be desired My husband planned to take me up the tower for a beautiful  romantic dinner We heard there was a Michelin star restaurant as well as a variety of other fine and casual eateries so we were really looking forward to a lovely datenight In short we got up to the top a few minutes too lateliterally all restaurantsfood establishments were either closed or closing by the time we made it to the top by cable car And it was only 930 Perhaps were late eaters BUT it would have been really nice to know this information in advance So the communication or lack thereof is the one downfall of this place We basically got to the top spent a couple of minutes looking around and needed to head back down as we were so hungry and had deliberately eaten a very light lunch so that we could enjoy our dinner So disappointingtruly We will for sure go back and plan our time better now that we know what we do about this place View is stunning cable car well organized though expect to wait over an hour for a ride to the top and I highly recommend setting aside a lot of time for exploring
3825,3,While everybody was enjoying the love locks i was enjoying the view The best time to go is autumn Seoul has one of the most beautiful autumn leaves in town So from up here you can definitely enjoy Variety of foods available up here as well Good place to visit Cable car qas also nicely organised
3826,4,The tower is a Seoul staple and worth a visit Im a big fan of skyline views and enjoyed it Although the city doesnt really boast anything extremely impressive to see in terms of visible landmarks the fact that it is so vast and so alive makes it worth it  Be warned that the lines are really longlonger than what Ive experienced for similar landmarks of this nature in other major cities This might be due to the fact that I visited during the ideal time and managed to catch the sunset Worth it
3827,4,On the last night of the holiday we were treated to a meal in the Seoul Tower Getting there after dark showed the tower lit in all its glory Entry was quick and the atmosphere friendly and inviting My meal consisted of a buffet starter followed by a soya stake everything was well cooked and hot
3828,3,We took the Namsan cable car to get to the N Seoul Tower Chose to go at night with hopes to catch the night view Queue was long for the cable car had to wait for over an hour to board  Went up to the tower scale was pretty small and price rather expensive comparatively Stayed up there for only 20 mins
3829,5,The N Seoul Tower is an excellent way to view the entire city of Seoul  capture the most amazing pictures The staff are all very friendly and helpful The property is very well maintained  clean Id definitely visit again We all enjoyed our visit  we even saw a samurai sword performance
3830,5,Youll love the view of the city from N Seoul Tower It is best to visit as the sun sets and the city slowly lights up And of course it is always interesting to read through strangers confession of love through the infamous locks
3831,5,This N Seoul tower you can see the whole view of Seoul and it is really romantic in the evening
3832,5,We went to the observation deck Nice view of Seoul from the top Bought a lot of fridge magnets from the souvenir shop Cheap and pretty
3833,4,Well worth a visit to see the vast city landscapePleasant and helpful staff throughout the trip and general feel good atmosphere in the tower and surrounding area with traditional dress and enactment to view
3834,3,On the day we visited the tower it was hazy so the views were blurry however we enjoyed the free shows in the gardens and walking around the park We visited during the autumn so the park was filled with golden and red leaf trees Very beautiful color to enjoy while taking stroll around the park
3835,3,Like many cities we want to get a glimpse of it from a high vantage point so we came here The walk up to the main entrance can be steep for some Short n a quick ride up n you get to scenic views of Seoul
3836,4,If you want to see the night view of seoul this is the perfect place for it It is very crowded every day and cable car has always long ques to get on I recommend take the bus to get to the summit other than cable cars also taxis cannot get to the summit so dont ask the taxi driver The Italian restaurant in the tower is good and you get great view of seoul from there 
3837,4,N Seoul Tower is a really nice place to visit mainly due to the amazing views of the city If you want to leave your own love padlock in N Seoul Tower make sure to buy your own locks in the city because inside the complex they are a little bit expensive There is also a nice show during the afternoon traditional music and sword fighting Quite entertaining and allows people to participate After you take the elevator to N Seoul Tower and arrived to the last floor there is a stand to send postcards to your friends and family
3838,4,Loved to go up the tower and see Seoul from above Seoul is a busy incredibly organised and clean Seeing from above you can really get how Seoul really is The way up you have to get quite a lot of stairs
3839,5,Well worth visiting We only had 3 nights in Seoul with our kids 8  10 years The cable car ride was fun to get to the top we went earlier in the day so nothing was crowded The top of the tower was a great view very hot inside though We walked down from the top which was a lovely walk back taking in the scenery
3840,3,My family and I decided to take the hike up to the N Seoul Tower rather than the cable cars since it had about a 2 hour wait The hike can get steep and considering how out of shape I am it was exhausting You get great views with this hike and many photo opportunities which I really enjoyed Once we reached the top I was just happy that I no longer had to walk Hah We purchased our tickets ant it was about a 1 hour 15 minute walk We ate at one of the restaurants that offered burgers and beers All very delicious We bought the ticket package that offered a free soda and popcorn And man that was a lot of popcorn Completely not necessary Once we got to the top it was extremely crowded The glass were extremely dirty so it was hard to get a good look out The wait for the elevator ride back down took about 40 minutes I am much more of a fan of the 63 City Tower
3841,5,We took a bus number 5 from Myeongdong to N Seoul Tower very convenient we did not went up to the tower as the weather that day is quite foggy we brought unwanted handphone cover  padlock for writing our wish  hang up against other people lock
3842,5,Its nice evening to visited there I enjoyed there with my best friend  we ate dinner and souvenir shop there Actually good for youths Evening is mainly is great time to there
3843,3,good thing is the amazing sunset view but i think you can have similar experience with other hilly places such as hukchon maybe because i had a tight budget but i feel the experience here is like downloading a mobile app that i think would be free then its inapppurchase with very heavy charges they charge you 800020000 krw for cable car or each floor if you want a full package you need to pay a lot this is very crowded ao it takes 1 hour just to stay in queue ;___;
3844,4,If you are first time in Seoul u need to make time to visit N Seoul Tower You can choose to hike up or took cable car Spend few hours up there You can choose to get up the building or can just walk at the area where ppl hook the peglocks and take photos
3845,5,The N Seoul Tower is an awesome place to view all of Seoul There are all sorts of things to do up in the tower and numerous places to eat at I would highly recommend a visit here
3846,5,Walked from my hotel 10 mins to the cable car no queue and no queue for tower lift maybe because it was early morning in December Great view over city with the sun shining toward the city Returned on Friday evening and had to queue up this time but not too long a waitIt was well worth a second visit in the dark to view the city lights
3847,4,You can walk up or take the cable car ride Nice place to walk around during the evening have dinner there follow by the night scene
3848,5,Easy access by Seoul City Bus Tour The bus drops and picks up at the designated bus stop which is about 200300m from the tower Its quite a steep walk up to the tower proper Its touristy but the view is beautiful even from ground level at the tower Theres a fee to get to the observation deck
3849,4,Great hike up and views from the top A little crowded and overresourced restaurants everywhere a post office a million professional photo opps tacky stuff for sale everywhere but overall amazing views Not the cheapest in town but worth doing We did the combo 2 beers popcorn and 2 elevator rides up which was around US 25 and a decent enough deal
3850,5,The best way to get up there if not on a tour bus is to walk up a hill to the cable car The guide books tell you where to do this This will get you to the bottom of the tower Then you pay again to take an elevator ride up to the top Still it was worth it The views are stunning and there is a restaurant and gift shop and the presentation is very well done
3851,5,You cant call your trip complete without a trip to the Seoul tower I strongly recommend walking up the mountain to get to the tower or taking the cable car I took the bus once and it was horrible I walked up to the tower many times starting at the Dongguk University campus At the start of the trail theres the university cafeteria and its cheap for those who want need some fuel for the 45min1hour hike up Very easy stairs go all the way up In autumn oh my gosh its the most beautiful thing I ever saw in Seoul the tower is the goal and definitely go up and get a view theres lots of fun things to do at the top and souvenirs and good food
3852,3,Good view of Seoul city from the tower Few restaurants and shops can be found Open at 10 am and would suggest to be early to beat the crowd You have to pay to ride the cable car to the namsan and to pay to get up the tower Seoul Tower structure similar to Japan Tower For city viewing you may make a trip for that
3853,5,I visited the tower on the evening on summer Was really crowded since it was a Friday night But it is really a romantic place but also great for families and people of any age It was free concerts and spectacle on that night and the vibe was really amazing
3854,4,Nice view to overlook the cith of Myeongdong and Seoul Breath taking walk up the mountain however there is also cable car to go up the mountain The view is excellant and totally money worth Even got to see Lee MinHo HAHA
3855,5,Went with my family for the first time since I was a toddler Amazing 360 view of Seoul We went during the day but id imagine Seoul is beautiful au night as well Totally worth it
3856,4,Visited in the autumn and spring but this place would be really pretty in the winter as well There is a cable car you can take to the tower or you can walk to the top or take a bus This is a popular attraction for young people especially couples who come here to put their lock at the platform Also has a great eveningnight view of the cityscape Admission is free but you can pay to take the elevator to the top which will have stunning views better than at the platform The top also has a teddy bear museum for those who are interested Recommended for couples and people who like kdrama as there are a few dramas that filmed here
3857,3,If you are going to Seoul Tower go for the cable car ride to Namsan Park Well at least to my experience best way to experience the autumn colors is via cable car and it saves you time as well
3858,4,recommended for lover who like to spend their time in romantic place can watch the whole seoul city at this place can access through by city bus walk in cable car
3859,5,Its a must visit place if you are in seoul Try going at about 3pm where you can take beautiful pictures with snow all over the hill As the day is very short It will turn dark at around 445pm to 530pm Thats where its the most beautiful Its very cold up there especially with the wind blowing very strongly
3860,4,Its a pretty neat tower I suggest to go during night time when all the lights are light up and pictures are a lot nicer Price is decent not overpriced I would recommend to visit when you get the chance to
3861,4,Many people take the gondola up to see the views from the North Seoul Tower however I would recommend against this because the hike up is wonderful If you are in decent shape do it
3862,4,I recommend to visit this tower around 5pm and wait till sunset Also its better to take bus from downtown The hill is super hard for hiking begginers
3863,4,A great view of the whole of Seoul this is definitely worth a visit Try and get here for sunset so see the city light up
3864,4,Beautiful view a lot of photo spotThe park and garden is beautiful The observatory is nice and there are a lot of restaurants too The locks fence is very interesting
3865,4,Were lucky to have a parking space Kris our Tour told us Specialist from This Is KOREA that you may also ride a cable going to the area Aside from the majestic N Seoul Tower and the best view of Seoul theres a loft surrounded with thousands of padlocks The padlocks are interconnected and interlocked together left by lovers to the metal fence of the loft that created a unique background for taking pictures We took turns in having our pictures taken there
3866,5,Getting to this tower was all part of the experience The combination of cable car and then the tower lift was good The tower provides good views  I was there on a sunny day and I think this was important I imagine a day with poor visibility would be les rewarding
3867,5,Breathtaking views from the top of the tower Got to enjoy the amazing sunset Its worth every won paid for the ticket A must see
3868,5,took gondola up the mountain but we decided to go up the towerit was soo charming would totally do it again
3869,5,I recomended to visit this tower in the night because the view is more exciting You can buy a offer entrance with a beer
3870,4,Visited November 17 2015  PROS Long hike but you will appreciate every view while going at the top The Locks of Love at the top was awesome colorful and attracting There were a lot of Restaurants and shops too to cater what you want  CONS Too many tourists  LOCATION  45 SAFETY  45 PRICE  45
3871,5,I always visit during the summer The city bus takes you to the top of the moutain but you still have to walk up the hill little bit You can see the nice view of Seoul during the day and the night view is great
3872,5,It is a must to understand how vast is Seoul They have put the name ot many cities in the many windows on the observation desk with their specific distance from Seoul Nice initiative
3873,4,Seoul tower is recommended for first time visitor to Seoul Though Seoul is not famous for night views unlike other Asian cities the setup of the overall place is quite romantic great outing for couple alike
3874,4,We went up at dusk so we got to see the view during daylight and evening which was very well timed and nice We walked up to the tower through the park but there is a cable cart if you dont want to walk Its quite a hike but its well work it theres places to stop with great views as you go up The price to get in isnt too bad and the gifts are surprisingly not too expensive either The views incredible Work a visit
3875,4,Cable car ride up the hill 8500W round tripperson there lots of nice walks to appreciate the view and the surrounding forest Food and souvenirs are abundant 9000W to take the elevator to the tower itself there the view is even better lots of souvenirs and food and beverages also available
3876,4,Went to the N Seoul tower area at night time It was not too crowded so made for a nicer viewing experience Its not overly cheap for a ride to the top but its a rather nice view Its worth a visit if you want a nice view of the city Can take as much or as little time as you like
3877,3,Its like an icon of tourism in Seoul All tourists must visit this tower eventhough you only took some pictures in front of it Ride a cable car if you dont like hiking lol Its beautiful when youre already up there
3878,4,My family and I went there in the afternoon Even we went there on weekdays it was very crowded Must be very popular I know but It was more crowed than I expected There is some performance that was nice too It was difficult to see the view becasue of lots of people
3879,4,Lovely trip up in the cable car gives you a great view of the city and the fall leaves which we loved There is a little bit of walking involved at the top to get to the entrance to the tower so please be aware if you have elderly travellers with you or kids in strollers We spent the morning at the Live Art museum which was a lot of fun would recommend getting there early as would think itll get very busy later in the day Worth getting a ticket which includes the museum and the trip to the top of the tower the views are spectacular
3880,5,Nice to have a view on the city We went on a rainy day with less view They show the direction and distance to other world cities when you walk around interesting Our tickets were paid for by our host so I cannot tell if the price is reasonable or not Dinner on the tower Hankook restaurant; you pay for the view Food is good but below Seoul high standards
3881,4,You can see Seoul from the above and it have some spot to put your padlocks love  its quite romantic in the night but you must prepare your energy to walk uphill from the main street to reach the cable car station
3882,4,Daylight was short in November and it was dark by the time we reached Namsam at 5 plus However the night city view was amazing Do dress warmly if you are intending to visit the place in the evening
3883,4,We met a very friendly local man to guide us to the top of tower and enjoyed the beautiful scenery along the walking pathway
3884,4,We walked uphill to reach the tower It was good exercise and a much needed one too The view from the top was breathtaking
3885,4,We got on one of the busses that take you to all the major locations and one of them we stopped off here There was a bit of an uphill trek to there so if you arent fit you might find yourself puffing and stopping There is really nice views and you can sit and enjoy it We were there during autumn so it was very beautiful The locks was a cute sight of peoples love We had a really nice churro sundae strawberry The trek down the hill was a little scary haha You have to pay to go inside the tower
3886,4,easy to go up with bus make u see view along the road u have to go in autumm u will see n seoul tower with various colour of trees tge checkpoint is where ppl hang 2 keys together in all around there
3887,3,Make sure you go on a clear day; unfortunately when we were there it was cloudy overcast and a little foggy The grounds and surrounding area are still well worth the trip up the hill
3888,5,We also have a good time good place and especially good food in there We took a cable car from Myung Dong but the exit I cant remember then go to cable car The weather was so good in November Autumn is my favorite time to travel because threes and leafs change their color its beautiful in Seoul Tower
3889,4,I didnt purchase the ticket to go to the top of Tower cos the main crowds are at the summit U could take a cable car or trek up Besides the locks greeneryand scenic views there are also eateries But u could just sit without eating and chill while absorbing the skyline view
3890,4,The view is nice you can see almost the entire city of Seoul is a small park and courting couples take a padlock with love letters and place it in the places assigned certain sealing their love
3891,4,Gotta have to say when we were on the top of the tower the morning fresh air in spring was so so so cold We grab a churros and hot coffee from the ground floor and went to the top and enjoy the metropolis hazy view from the observation deck On the deck outside u can see the collections of the sappy romantic locks around the world p p Before we take off we bought a few souvenirs there It was pretty cute and i think it worth the price tho
3892,4,A moderately challenging hike up is rewarded with spectacular views of the city For a dramatic sunset treat this is the place to be Bring your camera
3893,4,If you enjoy a great sight over Seoul you should definitely check out the N Seoul Tower Combine this attraction with the Cable Car Ride up also you can enjoy fantastic views from Namsan Park in which the Tower is located The Tower itself is not too full like others I have visited like the tickets stand was quite empty and we didnt need to queue up a lot I wish the observation deck would be a lot darker because as a photographer its really hard to make good photos due to the reflections of the souvenir stores To be honest while I enjoyed the view I think Building 63 is a lot better for photographers because its darker its emptier and you have a view towards the Seoul Tower which you can include in your cityscape photo
3894,5,U need to take train go to the station myeongdong exist 3 then walk until u see parcific hotel  walk from the right side of hotel  dont go left coz left is abut far but got few nice restaurant the running man tv show been there  Right side is near the tower  Then take the cable car  ticket is 8500 KRW person  Then ticket entry the tower is 9000 KRW  if u want other like combo package with popcorn drink or with live museum there are different price  There have a lot lock for couple u can lock your love maybe there believe  The view is pretty esp now is fall season  better come at sunset time u can see the beautiful view from day to night  If u dont want take cable car u also can walk 
3895,4,Lines are a little long but its worth it Take the cable car up if you dont want to walk lots of hills to get to the entrance There are restaurants shops and fun activities within the tower area Locks of Love is great for all the lovers You can also buy a dinner package Italian restaurant was decent but took a long time to get our food
3896,5,The view of N Seoul Tower was so perfect for couples in love with all the paddlocks they left behind to show how much they loved each other The time I were there a feeling of loneliness suddenly set in Becasuse I lost my husband 16 years ago But after seeing lots of couples enjoyed taking pictures at that romantic place I was relieved of the loneliness and feel very happy for them
3897,4,Came here in mid November and still had a great look of Autumn leaves If going to the tower is your thing it is 9000 won per person without any deals I breezed through it as there is only so long you can look at city views On the other hand the base of the tower gives good enough views at all 360 degrees and theres restaurants and cafes to spend time there too I highly recommend at least taking the 30 minutes walk down after youre done You save some money and is a very pleasant walk Lastly choose a clear and sunny day otherwise theres nothing much to see
3898,4,N Seoul Tower located at the uphill on Seoul You can go there by bus or like me by using a cable car at Myeongdong N Seoul Tower is the famous place where you can overlook the city of Seoul from its observation deck Insides there are observation deck restaurant gift shops in it You also can enjoy lighting show around the tower at certain time at night around 7 pm To get into the observation deck you have to pay the ticket you can choose to buy the ticket only or can buy ticket which also include snacks and drinks
3899,4,N Seoul tower entrance has a very nice viewI love itI wouldnt recommend going to N Seoul towerJust look at the view around the entranceTo methey looked almost the sameI dont like to ride cable car cos it is very squeezy n long queueI would recommend to ride cable car for 1 way and walk down the mountainIn the same timeyou can enjoy a nice view
3900,4,Nice walk thru the park up to the tower for the some lazier visiters you can take the bus up to the tower Great view from the observation platform
3901,2,This might have been an attraction years ago but feels quite lame now Nothing interesting to offer but a decent view; not cheap and nothing to do other than to go up the tower Can skip
3902,4,Went there because my brother want to hang the lock at the tower Love the view able to walk up from the bottom of the hill  There is cafe and restaurant there Bought a set that provides beer and pop corn for me to enjoy while enjoying the excellent view  I took bus 5 from Myeongdong to get here Worth a visit
3903,3,First time traveler may find it interesting Otherwise spend just 30 minutes and thats all you need Though walking downhill is a great experience so if you travel by cable car up the hill buy just 1 way ticket
3904,4,Getting there we took taxi going to the Seoul Tower since our hotel is just along Seoul Station Our Taxi were not allowed to go directly to N Seoul Tower even for drop off Thus we took the bus for 500 won just along the street Its not the yellow bus its just an ordinary bus that will drop you off at N Seoul Tower Bus no 2 3 and 5 I will attached a photo and you can check it out  You can hike going to the steep road to Seoul Tower Accordingly its 2kms We prefer the bus to save our energy ;  The place is cool with the love padlocks There are also souvenir shops and restaurants in the area
3905,4,The line up to the Observatory will take about 40minutes Once at the the tower I was in awe seeing all the city lights The view is awesome But there isnt much activity so after a few photos taken we went back down It takes more time to line up than staying on top of the tower for the view of Seoul City
3906,4,Visited here because it was part of the tour package we availed I highly suggest that you get a bus tour for this because the way up is really tiresome Or for the adventurous the cable car going up might just work  You can find here the famous locks hanged in a terrace near the tower You can either buy from the shops or have your own but I suggest bringing your own because it is really pricey  You get to write your name and message for your significant other and drop the key in the post box Nice gesture for lovers and families as well
3907,5,lovely place and beautiful view of night scenery i will come again in winter season cc Geum JanDi
3908,4,This place is accessible by cable car but the hill is not too high for the adventurous to climb down the steps instead The colourful love locks along the way make for an interesting backdrop for picturesIt was foggy on the day we went but worth a visit
3909,3,To go to namsanseoul tower you can choose either by cable car or stairs up but during springautumn night and winter highly recommended by cable car as its very cold From up you can see Seoul city either you go to the top of the tower or just around top area For the price to go to inside tower personally I feel ok compare to other cities even not that cheap though
3910,4,Take the cable ride going up There are several options in going up to the tower  plain sightseeing or with meals Nice view of Seoul A must see view of the place
3911,5,this is a very nice place especially at night time but you have to checked the love lock and write your name and the date when you visit the place and dont forget to dine in on top of the tower and the restaurant is revolving and you can see the beautiful seoul city
3912,5,Even you are not a tourist You must need to visit here and see the night view  It really makes everyone feel peaceful and happy  If you like to run here is good place to running too Lot of runners in Korea love to running in Namsan  Suggest to visit here at night This tower is located at the center of Seoul city so its good to visit another place after it 
3913,5,To go to the Namsam Tower is a wonderful experience From the top you can have a 360o view of Seoul City There is a restaurant on the top and you can have a nice dinner Reservation in advance for dinner is recommended
3914,3,We took the Seoul city tour bus up to the tower You still have to go up an incline to get to the base of the tower The place is quite crowded with many tourists And it is a bit of wait to go up Its extremely expensive It is not much different from visiting the Empire State Building or the CN tower When we were there one of the womens toilet exploded Quite gross but not much you can do when someone overstuffed the thing
3915,4,My friend and I take a circular shuttle bus up to the N Seoul Tower from Myeong Dong around 5pm It was a cold day in April 2015 we can see some cherry blossom tree with flower along the way up When we reached the bus stop at N Seoul tower we need to walk a little uphill to reach the tower There are pretty flower around the tower At the observatory area the fences are full of Love Locks We bought our tickets and go up the tower the view from the tower is quite amazing took a lot of photos while we are there and we buy a postcard each and post it from the tower However only my friend postcard reached her house mine was lost As we are going down from the tower in a bus at about 8pm I find it very romantic as I see couples walking side by side down the hill
3916,4,I visited N tower on a weekend afternoon Great night view You can use the elevator for free near Sogongro not far from the cross junction with Toegyero heading south then take the cable car long queue during peak hours which you need to pay separately Its a tiring trip for a family with small children to visit the tower but worth it
3917,3,Went here yesterday and finally after 3 hours managed to get to the top of the n tower Be prepared to wait And be prepared to wait a long time We waited over an hour just to get on the cable car and then had to wait again to go up the tower The cable car takes you up the steep hill to the base of the tower and then you need to take the elevator to the top It is possible to walk to the base of the tower but it is quite a long steep walk That may be preferable to waiting the 70 mins we waited for the cable car though  Views from the top are magnificent though Make sure your going on a clear day as youd be pretty annoyed to wait so long to get up to not see much
3918,5,You can go there using train and bus Walk to the top Enjoy the view Its better come at 4 pm so you can enjoy day and night A lot of couple come here bring their love keychain There is additional charge to get to tower but enjoying from the top of the hill is OK
3919,4,Great scenery over Seoul and the river Definitely worth a visit although the lift up feels a bit over the top The restaurant there is a little pricey as well
3920,3,This was a good experience worth the effort getting up there I was there during sunset and the view was nice Eating up there is expensive and not special
3921,4,To reach this place you can use by foot climb mountain or take cable car that will bring you up to mountain for round trip cost 8500 won person along the way to mountain you can see beautiful tree with many kind of colour refresh your eyes at the mountain you can visit the place for couple then to enter tower you must buy ticket again you can see the city from above
3922,4,Very popular in the city and for tourists Very crowded in weekends It is not recommended when weather is rainy or not clear because the main purpose is to seek the city from very high point 2 hours are good for this visit
3923,5,If you plan not to walk up to the tower plan to visit during late morning hours to avoid long queues at the cable station  The N Seoul Tower itself gives you a magnificent views over the city plus something to eatdrink up there  During out visit we also saw a performance presenting techniques to handle swords etc at the foot of the tower  If only possible take a walk down because it is absolutely worth it
3924,4,This is one of the main attractions of Seoul and is a very worthwhile visit especially to view Autumn colors In order to get to the tower you must climb a very steep road which is probably a 20 degree incline so if you have difficulties walking you may want to reconsider However it is not a long walk and could be completed within 10 minutes At the base of the tower you could get a magnificent view of the city of Seoul as well as view the thousands of love locks that are attached to the chain fence by lovers who wants to be locked in life forever
3925,3,Probably my own fault that I chose to visit this on a holiday weekend in Seoul but the queue to get to the top was hours long Price quite reasonable for the cable car journey and the views when at the top were worth it Obviously was very busy on this occasion and this did detract a little from the experience  A lot of restaurants and cafes at the base of the actual tower
3926,4,If you visit Seoul you should go there and dont forget your camera cuz you will see the view of Seoul cityand you can try the cable car too
3927,4,We walked up from the nearest bus stop whilst on a hop onhop off bus tour The walk is by no means far but it is steep and probably unsuitable for elderly However the cable car delivers you to the top and we took it to get down lovely views The lovelocks are colourful and a quirky addition to the walkways and bridges at the top
3928,4,I went here with my friend This was a good spot for sight seeing This is definitely a place for couples Parking around there is a little crazy so be prepared for that
3929,4,Coming from Toronto Ive had my fair share of taking an elevator up an extremely tall structure to a circular platform and yelling I can see my house from here However I had some time off and it was a BEAUTIFUL day The hike up through Namsan Park is an excellent way to get glimpses of the city with a beautiful surrounding I spent most of my time in the park and at the base of the tower taking some interesting photographs The restaurants at the base are also pretty good Im a foodie and love to try food whenever I can Theyre not horribly priced and make for a nice meal on a bright sunny day The souvenir had a few things to offer Im not one to usually spend money St souvenir shops but they had a cool scratch out map that I had been looking for Admittedly the views from the top were really nice on a clear day Perfectly clear days are really rare in Seoul so I was really fortunate And no I couldnt see my house But I could see some landmarks and it offered a nice view of the city although you can enjoy similar views from Naksan bukhansan and other mountains in the region The advantage of this view was that you can get a 360 view looking out rather than into the city
3930,5,If you want to appreciate the true size and beauty of Seoul then you must take a trip to the top of the tower  Although its not the cheapest tower Ive visited its certainly not unreasonable from memory it was about 12 I recommend taking the walk to the base of the tower rather than getting the cable car to save a bit of money and burn some calories  it really isnt too taxing and theres a few fun things to see along the way Try leave before sunset so you can watch the sun go down too The walk up will probably take about 30 minutes in total  Overall highly recommended A must do in Seoul 
3931,5,Take bus no1 n a 5mins walk to the tower walk ard interesting view n leave a love padlock there if you want After you can take the same bus or cable car \6000 down to the namsan orumi Take a slow walk down hill n ve a great coffee at cafes alongits just a 10mins walk down n you reach myeongdong
3932,4,One of the landmark of Seoul for visitors to visit One can take a bus directly to the based of North Tower from the city or there is also another option to take a cable car from the lower base of the Tower One can get a panoramic view of the entire city of Seoul from variuos spots around the basement or from the very top of the North Tower There is also plenty of remembrance locks place along the handrails at the basement of the North Tower by visitors A place to visit if one need to see a panoramic view of Seoul
3933,4,It is situated on hilltop and is the highest point of Seoulit is also a part of Seoul sightseeing day tourpublic transport bus also ply regularly on this route The drive to uphill is really nice One can go on hiking too a breathtaking view of the entire Seoul city from the Seoul tower is awesome
3934,4,Take the cable car up on a clear day to experience an amazing view of Seoul Then check out the gallery and restaurants at the top You can then take a gentle stroll down through the forest of the hill
3935,5,A must see for first timers in Korea gives you a 360 degree view of the wonderful city and beyond We went during Autumn and the view was just marvelous seeing the different hues of nature Experience was all the more made great with Exclusive Tour Korea with their very friendly and knowledgable tour guides Heather was definitely our favorite
3936,5,The tower might be similar to the other telecommunication towers but what makes it different is what you can see and experience at the foot of the tower  the beloved square and the wishlock area  There are thousands of locks locked to each other  I have just posted some pics on the area 
3937,3,The N Seoul Tower was a serious touristy spot The night we went was incredibly crowded  they had several busses of kids there touring the tower so our wait to even get up to the elevators was and hour or so long Once we got to the top the view was gorgeous Seoul was a huge city Our way down took almost just as long as it did to go up There was a line that snaked around to wait for the two elevators to take us back to the cable car You pay a few extra dollars but its worth it to take the cable car down to the ground floor Overall Im not too much into crowded places so probably wont be back again However I am a believer of always trying things as least once
3938,5,Great view We took the subway to a bus Check the schedule of when the last bus leaves When we were there the tower was open till 11 but the last bus left at 1030
3939,4,I enjoyed all the different view with the different cities how far away each city is The gift shop has so much to offer I mailed postcards from the Tower It is expensive to eat at the Tower The day we went to Tower was raining and overcast which made it appear very smog Would go again anytime
3940,5,Excellent in autumn Perfect view and very romantic place Must see if in town Take the elevator on the bottom then pay the fee to go on the lift and then another fee to go up on the tower Not cheep but not expensive Good burger at the base of the tower A great place to go with your loved one
3941,4,If you want to look at the enormous size of Seoul you have to go there Accesible by public transport cable car or by foot Admission is a bit expensive 9000 W but if you have the luck not to wait too long in line it is worth it Charming locks at the top terrace a local attraction for lovers
3942,4,Nice place nice view of Seoul I recommed that you go up by cable car and get down walking to enjoy the scenery It takes 20 minutes to go down walking but it is all downhill
3943,4,I definitely love the locks wall Bring your lovely lock to add to this interesting wall This wall is also great for photography Night scenery of Seoul is magnificent  Easy to get to cable car for the ride up to the top Souvenir shop sell very interesting gift though little on the high price  N Seoul Tower is a must visit place for all tourists
3944,5,Its an amazing experience to be really high up and get a good look at South Korea Make sure to bring a lock to put on the lock wall They also have performances and cultural dancing A lot of different places to take pictures
3945,5,This was one of the highlights of our visit to Seoul The line to board the cable car which takes you to the top of the hill was very long but it was well worth it Once you get up to the tower the view is breathtaking and the tower at night is beautiful When it was time to get back down we decided not to stand in line once again the line was very long for the cable car and walk all the way to the bottom of the hill instead I am glad we did even if I have to give everyone fair warning if you decide to walk down wear comfortable shoes and be prepared for a rather long trek
3946,4,We took the advice of others and planned the long trek up Namsan Hill later in the day It was cooler and gave great light for taking photographs The tower itself is as others mentioned mostly a gift shop but the view was worth it They have a few green screens where you can have your picture taken for souvenir photos and a fun elevator with a cute show on the ceiling as you ride it We then took the tram down and caught a cab to dinner
3947,4,Most popular place in Seoul must to visit this place enjoy the top of Seoul and locked love Dont forget to stop by the lovers corner to tied your love if you are travelling as couple
3948,3,The surrounding park area is nice some stuff to do around the tower a lot of Japanese tourist so no peace watching the city Went in daytime which was a mistake smog took away most of the sight better was to visit 63 building in night time no people and great view
3949,4,It is recommended to visit during the night  It is not worth to pay 9000 won to take the lift up to the top though You will see great panoramic view of city even if you do not really pay for it  Just walk around and snap some photo will do  You can either take a bus  hike up or take a cable car up  I would recommend to take a bus up 
3950,3,Actually trying to find the place nearly killed our spirits as everyone we asked gave us some sort of wrong directions but we did find it and the tower is kinda pricey9000 KRW and the cable car  8500 KRW is not too bad eventhough they tend to pack you like a bunch of sardines
3951,5,The first thing I want to make clear is that its not easy to get there depending on which subway station you exit from It took us approximately half an hour of uphill walking to reach the cable car and I heard it takes another 40 or so minutes if you walk instead of taking it  The view is however absolutely worth it the atmosphere too Theres so many people and its so beautiful looking out over Seoul at night time  The gift shops are well stocked with all sorts of cute trinkets from Big Bang X Monster plush toys to keyrings and post card featuring Jetoy cats  Theres also a beautiful traditional building near the foot of the tower
3952,4,You will see great panoramic view of city and its Even more beautiful at night Love lock is so romantic for couple who wish their love to be eternity
3953,5,The Seoul Tower is located on probably the highest Hill in Seoul You can reach it by Cable Car The Tower offers the best possible views over Seoul
3954,5,After admire this place only on TV so we got really excited to come to this place The view is awesome and were really enjoy our time here
3955,4,If youve seen pictures of Seoul chances are youve seen one with the N Seoul Tower Korea doesnt have much in the way of architectural landmarks  at least not as many as some other tourist hotspots  but this tower has always provided a focal point in the Seoul city skyline  The surrounding area under the tower has a handful of souvenir stores restaurants and cafes while the tower itself provides some good eats married with good views of the city  A meal at the N Seoul Tower at night proves to be a great activity just remember to cross your fingers and hope that no fog nor smog ruin the views during your visit
3956,5,We lucked out the day was perfect you can see everything from this point There is an area where couples can put a lock on the fence with their names professing their love forever You can purchase the locks at the site Its very charming There is also a chimney ceremony reenacted up there
3957,4,Nice place though we need to running uphill around 1 km but it paid off when weve arrived in a top since we can see a good view in seoul but unfortunetly teddy bear museum has already moved so i cant see that museum
3958,4,The view is amazing from the top of Seoul tower but only worth to go up in clear weather When we were there at night it was too foggy to see further Also it took ages 30mins to get to the top due to the long queue waiting for the elevator
3959,5,The place is very nice we can actually do a lot of things there  such as taking picture relaxing sport Cos there were many stairsetc The restaurants there were so nicethe food was totally delicious and the atmosphere was so great the location also near to one of the most famous street in korea its myeongdong street 
3960,3,I went in the late morning sun was behind the tower could not take photo  Nothing much to see except if you are keen in the couple lock  Night view is much nicer
3961,3,Not sure if it was just the day we got there but once up to the top We couldnt see much as it was very smoggy The ride to the top was one a minute Small elevator but the line up was very short Its interesting looking at the million of love locks
3962,3,You can see a romantic view from the top At the terrace you can find so many padlock love seems like in france You can reach N Seoul Tower at Namsan Mt By cable car or bus I love the city view from N Tower but im so sad because teddy bear museum was closed last year
3963,4,It is a nice place to view the city We can go by bus cable car and even walk from ground There are some maple trees So can take photos easy other than travel to far away place if you just stay few days in Seoul
3964,4,Im not normally a huge fan of going up to high places to look at citieson the ground is more interestingbut this was worth it Seoul is incredibly large and these views are the only way to get the full sense of it The system is pretty good for getting people up the tower and back downbut know that the line can get long for the down elevator
3965,4,A little overrated its not as tall as the other towers from other countries I have been too It was pretty cool because they have the love lock on the fence right below the tower I recommend walking up instead of taking the tram It takes about the same amount of time
3966,5,We took the cable car up at around sunset and enjoyed the view of Seoul in both the late afternoon and at night Took pictures with the wall of padlocks An interesting part of any Seoul itinerary
3967,5,My family and i went to N Seoul Tower last week We choose to visit the tower during night time It is a distance from the bus stop to the tower But everything is worth when I saw the tower The tower looks awesome with different colour lighting It is surprising me with the love locks there Sadly there are some places are being doodle
3968,4,Visited in Autumn and the view from the top is very beautiful We got the package where we got popcorn Man the popcorn is very big we are unable to finish Anyway the tower is nicely situated at Namsam park and the foliage is beautiful You wont miss the tower you can see it anywhere in Seoul
3969,3,Just another observatory Basically you have to pay for the cable car ride and then another ticket for the observatory Alive museum can be visited if you pay 3000 won extra for a bundle ticket observatory and alive museum View is good but not spectecular on top There are combo packages with the cafe as well Cable car ride was quite dissapointing as the view was limited and the ride rather short
3970,4,should hv walk up if you able to but taking the cable car you will be offered breathtaking view They sell padlock which are way too expensive if on tight budget like me bring your own Serve the same purpose right
3971,4,Enjoy a birds eye view of Seoul from the upper viewing deck The lift takes you up in 30 seconds flat The place is crowded with lots of tourists
3972,4,We saw the N Seioul Tower from the foot of the hill near Myeongdong and it is like our guiding landmark leading us back to the hotel in Chungmuro
3973,4,We went there at sunset it was beautiful The lights were lit up We did not go up in the tower because the fee was quite expensive but area surrounding the tower was nice
3974,4,As per above; go there and put a lock with your names forever Otherwise that place is packed with tourists
3975,5,Once youve gotten to the tower itself after taking the Namsan Cable Car the view at night is breathtaking  There are restaurants and you can also pay to go up to the observatory
3976,5,It is an interesting place There is a nice road to get there and you should hike until the top of a hill The you see the beautiful tower
3977,5,Somewhat touristy in the plaza at the base but up on top the Frenchstyle restaurant is lovely Great food smooth attentive service and fantastic views Walking back down the hill rather than taking the tramcar we saw some very interesting areas
3978,3,Would have rated higher but the week I was there the smog over the city for the entire time prevented a very good look of the city On Monday there is not a City tour bus to take so you might consider doing a chartered tour or cable car i made the walk up and would not recommend this except for the extreme fitness advocate
3979,4,Nice cool day Walking to the peak is a must Get ready for your fitness challenge Seeing is believing
3980,3,Since we were with our 10m old baby we went to N Tower in the morning I do think this landmark is a worthtogo place esp young couple with baby there were way too many tourists which you couldnt find a place to take a good picture
3981,3,Long queue up to Namsan Tower Was advised that the best view is during sunset but missed it due to the long queue to the foothill of the tower  Locals and tourists flock to this tourist spot for the lovelocks which have become a lovers haunt Other than that nothing much to do there
3982,5,Perfect place to see the whole beauty of Seoul at the highest peak You need to take the cable car first before taking the lift to reach at the peak of N Seoul Tower
3983,4,Its a good experience though I recommend hiking rather than riding the cable car on the way to the top Its good theres show during 4pm onwards outside the vicinity The observatory is so so You can see the buildings and thats it hehe Nothing much special but its worth an experience though
3984,2,We bought tickets to go to the observatory glad we used a discount coupon Its like we bought entrance tickets to a souvenir shop to be honest A short elevator ride and an even shorter walk around the observatory Nothing much to see or do there  The vicinity is nice interesting to see all the locks and the night view of Seoul but no need to go up the observatory I find that its a waste of time and money even if it was relatively cheap using coupons
3985,5,To enjoy the entire view of seoul go up to the observation tower there is an entrance fee required  You can either climb up Mt Namsan take the cable car or take a bus Either of this there will still be about 300400m of upslope walking required  Night view is spectacular so I would suggest to go after dark instead of day time
3986,4,Provides an excellent view of Seoul city I was able to send a postcard to my friends from the highest point of Seoul Be prepared for a queue but it is worth it
3987,5,Like most countries N Seoul Tower is definitely a gorgeous signature building of Seoul Not only its beautiful skyline of the city can be crystally seen but also the outlook of it is awesome right from the ground
3988,5,I went to the tower at night and had a great view of Seoul Enjoyed it They have a gift shop and a place to eat This is a must see
3989,4,Been here for a day tour while on a business visit Its really an amazing experience to travel when you dont know the local language Still managed to reach in time  Weather was very pleasant  Gives you a panorama of the city
3990,4,I like this placeyou have to try riding the cable carplease avoid holidayscoz it will be super duper crowdedor if you want to go on holidaysyou can go through the stairs to the towerthe tower is very pretty at night
3991,5,We took the Namsan cable car to get here that was quite an experience on its own Had lunch straight away upon arrival at Best Burger in Seoul yum Great facilities and friendly staff at N Seoul Tower made us feel comfortable We took the lift up to observation deck had our souvenir photo taken and very much enjoyed the birds eye view from the top
3992,5,Dont ever think of walking up to namsan tower is might waste of your time Buy round trip ticket and spend your value time to the other places in Seoul
3993,3,If youre coming here looking forward to a beautiful night view you may get disappointed I would only recommend the place for lovers  couples
3994,3,We went just before dark which I would suggest doing as the lights are pretty cool However the huge amounts of people do take away from the experience  Take advantage of the shuttle busses that run to and from the tower to all points across the city They are cheap and are better than walking up the mountain
3995,3,Like most places in Korea this attraction was very overcrowded I was bumped into and elbowed and had my foot run over by a stroller  We were crammed into the elevator and got to the top of the tower to the shoppingviewing area Again shoving our way through crowds to try and get to a window for a view Everything looked nice with the leaves changing colors and you can see a lot from up there  Considering the price paid and the hassle of the crowd I would not go again or recommend anyone else to either The views were not worth it to me
3996,4,Being from NYC I tend to go to attractions that requires elevator rides at night The city lights were beautiful from all sides It was particularly heartfelt for me knowing that my mom rode the cable cars everyday to work in her twenties I believe it was 9 to go up to the cable cars and another 19 to go up the tower Make sure to stop by the restaurant even just for a beer And walk around the area below the tower and take photos Its lovely; especially by the lit up pagoda and where the lovelocks are Up in the tower is a 360 of Seoul and a souvenir shop that sells really cute stuff that is unavoidable to purchase 
3997,4,Everything is lovey dovey here Cousin and I went in the evening and it was still crowded but at least it didnt take us too long to wait for the cable car Gotta wear a pair of good shoes as you might need to walk up a steep hill to reach the cable car station
3998,5,A visit to Seoul is really incomplete without a visit to the North Seoul Tower The top of the tower seats 777 ft above sea level It also boasts of the highest post office on earth where you can buy a postcard write in some love words and send to your loved ones across the world Also try to buy the love padlocks which comes with a pen that you can use to write your nae and your loved ones name on the padlock It is exciting
3999,5,We did an evening visit If you want to realise how huge Seoul is  go for it A bit rowdy etc But this is quite common with such an attraction We climbed up didnt bother to wait for cable cart
4000,5,If you are looking to see Seoul this is a pretty good option for a panoramic view of the whole city  You can take a bus or cable car to the top of the hill and a short 200 meter walk up a few stairs to the tower If by bus the walk it is a bit further  I highly recommend taking a taxi to the base of the cable car our hotel told us we could walk it from Myengdong station it is a very long walk and uphill so i do suggest a taxi to the base of the cable car station  The view is pretty impressive it was a bit foggy during the time i went up but still a great view There are restaurants and dessert shops so you can sit down and enjoy the scenery and it isnt overpriced like some touristy places  To go up the tower you do have to pay extra ontop of the cable car fee there are many options with food and alcohol sets to go to the top but you can pay just to go up and its not to costly so when checking the prices make sure you look at all options they tend to not promote just going up and try to get you to buy set package tickets which are a bit pricey imho
4001,5,Love the fact that you can buy locks to write love notes there Not a very good idea to go during winter though Nevertheless nice place with nice views
4002,4,That is if youve already visited other towers in the world much taller newer viewing towers in other parts of the world The copy cat Love Locks are a nice touch And it does give a 360 degree view of Seoul skyline Theres a souvenir shop not too pricy And thats all there is to it Go for it for a routine part of the package tour
4003,5,Great place to take pics of the tower and the city streets below Lots of haze at dusk so save the picturetaking for when the sky is dark
4004,5,Day and night view of the tower give different feelings Night view is inspiring with the breathtaking scenery from the tower Dont forget to stop by the lovers corner to tied your love if you are travelling as couple
4005,5,The place is for all ages attraction Even though my mother in law and kids had a hard time going up Its a bliss when youre up there already Dont forget to bring your camera or your full battery phone for your photo ops Theres the observatory deck the couple bench and love locks area Snack stalls convenient stores and restrooms available
4006,5,Seoul tower attracted us during late evening hours when its lit day time its just like a scraper however night time you would love to take photos and be there for panoramic shot
4007,4,I have been here twice and the second time I went up to the viewing deck It was cool to see Seoul from that height We took the local bus to get there which is so much cheaper than the cable car but we did get stuck in traffic which was annoying I imagine that the view from the top at night would be spectacular we went in the afternoon and spent some time figuring out what we could see from the top
4008,4,Before you go up to the top of this tower look for the marker that shows that this is located at the geographical center of Seoul Then take the very fast about 30 second elevator to the top to get great 360 degree views of Seoul On the glass windows are mile markers to different cities around the world
4009,5,A good and so lovely place I was going use subway and just walk around 15  20 you can see that tower  n seoul tower  really easy to find it For going to that tower you have 2 choice first using a long long stair better you have exercise before climb that stair lols and 2nd using a unique lift I was chosen lift of course lol to buy a ticket to that tower but you must queue a little bit for use that lift  At the second place you must buy gondola ticket to go to top mountain have 2 selection one way or return better choose return more cheaper You must queue again for use the huge gondola glass on the way to top mountain you can see all city from inside gondola And finally we on top of mountain aka N Seoul tower the land mark of korea  First view you can see almost beautiful real tree and love lock tree anywhere and everywhere hahaha If you forget bring your love lock dont worry they sell a unique lock and again better buy 2 for more cheaper and get free permanent pen for write you love on that lock better buy that lock in n seoul tower store in upstairs again more cheap  You can going to top tower buy tickets with selection with drink and popcorn or just buy the ticket  again buy 2 ticket with drink and popcorn was cheaper  You will using a cool lift because when you inside that lift we fill like going to space with big screen with full of star and planet in side lift and the staff will be explain a little bit about n seoul tower in the lift  On top N Seoul Tower we can see all cities from big windows also with many country written on that window and have explained how far away from korea to that countries  Inside tower have 3d museum and you should be go to that museum   If you want put your love lock better put love lock tree upstairs near N tower with a beautiful views  Dont forget bring you jacket because upstairs so windy and cool Sooo have fun you trip 
4010,3,It seems like a mark of Seoul When I went there in the daytime not felt much special There were some performances right outside the tower seemed special
4011,3,It is nice to see Seoul from above and get a 360 degree view of it It really shows how big this super city is However we went on a weekend so it was packed It was hard to get a glimpse of the views because of the crowd However we did not go up the tower only stayed at its base
4012,5,If youre going here with someone who isnt in it for walking just use the cable car There are actually two ways going up the cable car and by just walking If youre of course with friends go for walking it would take you more time to bond You can take pictures it the locks or buy locks to put it there  view above seoul and some chairs with design once youre there If you want to go in the tower you need to pay additional fee
4013,5,Well worth the money as the view is amazing The cable cars leave from there too which is an added bonus
4014,5,Revolving restaurant  must book If walking a fair climb up the hill Close to the Hilton Recommended for the first timer to Seoul
4015,4,Here is the best place to see this city And you can see the poverty and wealth of S Korea If youre planning to visit this attraction I suggest you to visit here at night YOU cannot forget the night view of seoul
4016,4,Its a short cab ride from the city  well worth it We went at 10am when it opens  were one of the first ones there for a short cable car ride then an elevator ride to the observation deck which is an additional fee The lady at the ticket booth went out of her way to tell me that they had a senior rate which was great at childs rate for over 65 saving us a lot There are quite a few eateries up on top but we did not eat there It was a beautiful day  we got great photos Its well worth the visit
4017,4,Very beautiful views of the city from up there Be ready to queue for the cable car and back and lots of stairs
4018,4,You can get there a number of ways I took the city bus tour and this stop was on route The views of the city are great even before you go up the tower Theres a few attractions to see a couple of guys with large saws cutting logs like Samurai The views from the tower are spectacular and you can get a 360 degree look at the city and beyond There are loads of photo opportunities and needless to say it was extremely busy Ive never seen so many selfies Theres a bit of a steep climb to start but after that the place was easy to get around It costs less than 500 to go up the tower This was a great introduction to the city
4019,5,Took the city tour bus to Seoul Tower Very wonderful experience Beautiful landscape Beautiful view from top of Seoul Tower Able to buy souvenirs City tour bus comes every half hour
4020,5,The hike up to this tower can be confusing if you dont follow the signs I found myself walking the wrong way a few times before I asked for directions Once youre half way up theres also an option to take the Namsan Cable cars up to the top so you can enjoy the aerial view of Seoul The cost for round trip is 6300 won Once you reach the N Seoul Tower at the time there are numerous other attractions like the Alive Museum souvenir shops and restaurants There are also food stands where you can purchase the potato tower snack You can also choose to pay 7000 won to go into the observatory For a great night view you should visit N Seoul Tower between 7 pm and 12 am for their illumination show
4021,3,Be prepared for some steep slopes before you could ride on the cable car View is beautiful but the place is a bit crowded Went there in the evening around 5pm to avoid the crowd as the queue for cable car could be quite long
4022,4,We caught a taxi up to the cable car and visited N Seoul Tower as it was on our Seoul Bucket List Must say it was refreshing and had an awesome view from the top as you could see al of Seoul It was a bit busy as there were many tourist groups up there Worth the trip but I personally wouldnt feel the need to go again now that I have been
4023,3,It was so crowded on a Friday night The cable car ride was dangerously packed after a 90 minute wait The elevator ride was a 40 minute wait although they told you 30 minutes when you buy your ticket Its not cheap and the view is the view I cant imagine it being romantic with the crowds but the locks of love are there
4024,5,This was my great ideahike up Mt Namsan with my two young boys get to the top have lunch eat ice cream and take the cable car down and cab it home  What a great experience We literally walked from the base of the Mountain where the National Theatre is located Cars are not allowed up to the top of the mountain but buses are numbers 2 and 5 But we hiked  My boys had the freedom to choose which paths they wanted to take They could hear nature take in the scenery and feel really proud of themselves when they got to the top There are maps and signs everywhere so you cant get lost Once at the top we watched some street performances stopped by the N Tower gift shop and ate Black bean noodles  Then we took the cable car down and the boys thought it was awesome We had a great afternoon got in great exercisefresh air and saw the city from the top  Tip when hiking with young kids dont forget water and some snacks
4025,3,Best to go around 5 and leave around 8pm Can consider to book NGrill revolving French restaurant in the tower for dinner at 6pm so that you can get to see the sunset  Do note that you need to climb the stairs a bit after getting off the cable car if you choose to get up on cable car instead of bus
4026,5,Go there just for the night view Plan to have dinner there after some pictures Unfortunately the only restaurant not on top of the tower serve very ordinary food like pizza and pasta 1 normal pasta charge 50000 won
4027,4,This tower has an excellent view from the top and lots of restaurants etc but it can be very crowded they post how long the wait is for the cable car There are also a lot of steps to climb
4028,4,I was planning to skip this attraction because of the lack of time but managed to squeeze it in at the last minute and really enjoyed the view from there I took the cable car round trip 8000 or 8500 won up because I was traveling with my mum who could not make the climb up on foot The 3 mins cable car ride is a quick and convenient way to get up the mountain if you cant spare the time and energy or fitness to make it up on foot I was there at about 930 am and got down to Myeongdong by 1130 am I wanted to miss th crowd and starting early is highly recommended or it will be quite impossible to take good pictures of the place Unless you plan to eat there 2 hours is sufficient for you to take in the sights this beautiful place offers and move to your next destination I took the elevator from the cable car station down to Myeongdong Its free and I find it a rather interesting contraption
4029,5,The N Seoul Tower is a must and i highly recommend visiting I took the hike all the way t the top and the view nature and scenery along the way was simply incredible It is an iconic landmark and something not to miss Take your family and kids so soak in the view of Seoul from here 
4030,4,Worth the climb to the tower Make sure you go to the top and admire the stunning views of the city Mesmerizing to watch all the lights from here It gets very busy at dusk and there are long queues to go up the lift but its a small price to pay Plenty of photo opportunities outside the tower but again you have to be patient and wait your turn
4031,4,went here at night time the attraction is recommended for visit bring your own couple padlock here to save money p the ticket to go up is quite expensive and nothing much at the top should consider to go up when you are in tight budget
4032,4,Buy a one way ticket up the lines are long going up and can be worse coming back down but much easier to walk down lots of steps unless you dont mind spending the extra won and time waiting
4033,3,I was pleased to send postcards from such place  The tower itself is only 200m and it costs 6000w to get to the top Bit too much considering how hard it is to get there by foot or 8500w cost of round trip in a cable car Not recommended
4034,5,A must visit when you are in Seoul You can see Seoul city on the tower It is more beautiful at night
4035,3,Expensive to ride the cable car and then expensive to go up the tower Was a cloudy day so didnt bother going up to the tower top Expensive food on offer
4036,4,N Seoul Tower is one of the iconic places to visit in Seoul While it is possible to take a bus  walk up be prepared for a rather steep walk hike to get there We walked up but took the cable car back down I was tired by the time we made it to the top  The tower itself is nice some great views of Seoul We went at night I enjoy seeing cities lit up at night Good for solo travel family couples people of all ages
4037,5,Not doing our research well we wound up on the wrong side of the tower at the bus entrance where our taxi driver was summarily dismissed Therefore we walked up the hill 26km to get to the base of the tower Now it was a beautiful walk but we were unprepared Right at sunset the view was spectacular at the base and then we proceeded to the observation deck to watch the city lights come up Very nice but crowded We made our way down and this time took the tram and the tunnel carnot really a tunnel to the street picked up a cab and headed out for some dinner Enjoy the view
4038,4,There are public buses that can get you there so just do some research on google or google maps Great view from the tower and fun to attach a love lock on the fence
4039,3,I visited the N seoul tower around 2pm I could see beautiful seoul city view But I remeber that admission fee is quite expensive it was about USD 9 It just going up
4040,3,Well if you are visiting Seoul you cant miss this oneunfortunately nothing remarkable thoughyou do get a good view of the city but the tower is not really that tallbit expensive but its standard for tall towers to charge this much  Nothing great apart from a good view of the cityoh yeah and there is a mens urinal offering a unique viewpositioning overlooking the city right 1 level below the observation deck
4041,4,The view is great You can see Han river some landmark buildings hills You can see various districts of Seoul skyscrapers next to Yeouido Park but there is not much more in it Anyway its definitely worth the visit for the view
4042,4,This place gives a stunning view of the entire Seoul City The Love Lock Tower that sits on this tower is a paradise for lovers You can see millions and millions of locks all over tower tied by the love birds to show their everlasting love for each otherI It is said that the couples come back here after few years to see whether their locks are intact If that be they believe that their love would stand all testing times The locks are available in the shops nearby that starts from 12000 Won Its one of the best place for photo shoot especially in the evening Upto the tower it is free and we do get the good view from this point too though going up to the observatory comes with a small price
4043,1,Too many people And very impolite people Long lines everywhere not good organized So we didnt enjoyd any single min I just wanted to get away from there as soon is possible 
4044,4,We went up twice once at sun set and once during the day The first time we went up we walked as the queue for the cable car was to long this was early evening time It took about 30 minuets to walk to the top when we got to the top it was extremely busy we were told that it was a 90 minuet wait to get to the top There are lots of view points around the base of the tower which offer extremely good views of Seoul  The second time we went up was about 10am there was a very little queue for the cable car which costs 6000won one way or 9500won return at the top there was no queue for tickets which cost 9000won to go to the observation floor The views from the top are amazing
4045,5,Caught the cable car up which has a fair wait and then walked around up the top before walking down through the beautiful park  It was a national holiday so there were traditional performances which were great Some reasonable food offerings and a calsberg cornder near wh
4046,4,Great view  before you reach the desk a perfect sales strategy you will find like stores Popcorn and sprite add in the Tickets aso Very good idea to show on the desk the location of other cities like Berlin Beijing Auckland Tokyo with distance
4047,4,Visit this place in the late evening for sunset and take a great shootAnd not too hot Worth the wait when I was there
4048,5,If you are in Seoul this is a must see place And very closer to the city If you need to go to the extreme top of the tower you need to pay more But just to the main deck is enough for a short visit
4049,4,A mustsee site if you are in Myeongdong We happened to catch a public performance of the Korea traditional costume dance and their Korea martial arts
4050,4,Beautiful views of a beautiful city where a quirky locking of the hearts demonstrates a couple licked together forever Tours aplenty delicious food lovely people
4051,5,I have spent a few evenings at N Seoul Tower and each of them have been spectacular The meal in the restaurant was delicious the views amazing and we were even moved to leave a tile of love on the wall A wonderful way to see Seoul at night
4052,4,If you come to Soul you will not arrive Soul without going to Soul tower You will find a lot of friends walking up to the towerMany lovers come to showed their love by putting key locked up thereThe ice cream there was very very delicious you should not miss it
4053,5,Good viewwe can buzzling seoul city from here But since were coming on national holiday a lot of people are heremany tourist little bit crowded Lucky me coming with tourist bus so we must not walking far but 300400m hiking from bus stop to the top in summer time is making us sweat and tireda must see
4054,4,We took the cable car up to the top of the mountain under the N Seoul Tower Because we got there too early we had to wait a while for the night to settle in and then travel to the top of the tower Thankfully they had lots of shops and food and the afternoon view was very beautiful as well If you decide to visit the N Seoul tower make sure you do so at night because the night view of the entire city is breathtaking
4055,3,A good thing is that you can go using public transportation or a hop on hop off bus Once you clime by foot a steep little road pay your fee you will be able to take the elevator to the near top of the tower where you can see the city Make sure its not foggy or rainy in my case the weather was perfect
4056,4,I dont like all the touristic stuff and I enjoy earning my way to the top so instead of taking the bus I just got to Namsan park and hiked to the tower Its not a stroll in the park but it was absolutely worth it I discovered some nice spots on my way up and the view from the top was great without having to wait in line and go up the tower
4057,5,What a great view we went up in the day time with a private tour fantastic view  Go during the week if you can as it will be crowed during the weekend
4058,5,You can easily catch the bus from Myeongdong to Namsan Tower  its a walk up a bit of an incline with a restaurant and teddy bear museum at the base You can see the lights of city if you go in the evening which I did and its pretty neat The lovers locks all over the fences are really awesome as well
4059,4,Visiting the N Seoul Town probably is the best thing I did in Seoul I took the bus from Myeongdong after getting my money exchanged and headed to N Seoul Tower It was a nice hike and the air was breezy It was 4 in the afternoon so it was not hot at all The view from the tower was great although the entrance could have been cheaper since not everyone wants to stay up there for a long time I got some nice N Seoul Tower postcards as souvenir before I left the place
4060,4,Nice and very worthwhile hilltop view of the City obtained by modest effort but going up into the Spire at an additional fee just did not inspire us The funicular getting there was fun
4061,5,We hiked up to the tower Its a workout but worth it when you get to the top You can also take the bus or ropeway to the top as well Sunset was pretty neat You have a great view of the city We also bought a lock and put our names on it Wasnt happy while hiking I was sick at the time but definitely glad I did it
4062,5,the view at the top during the night is superb but it can freeze you during the winter with the cold wind blowing at you its a nice plaxe for couples to visit and the fun thing is they have this shop that sells locks that couple buy and write their names or even wishes and lock it up and throw the keys into this mailbox that is being place there which means that the couple will be tie together forever nice and cool thing that they have created right one of the must visit place when you are in Korea its located at Myeongdong you can walk if your stamina allows you and you can figure your way up there cause we walked up all the way to N Seoul Tower then take the cable up c
4063,4,I would honestly say that I enjoy the view from Tokyo Tower a lot more because there is a nice view of the ocean and many different aspects of Tokyo The view from Seoul Tower has a lot of high rise apartments that take a little away from the view  Having said that I still enjoy hiking up the mountain or taking the cable car one way is \6500 and round trip is \8500 Once youre at the top you can see many locks where couples have come up to pledged their love for each other You can also see a teddy bear museum a store actually a few restaurants and some nice views of the city stretching all the way to the Han River  Finally if you want to see a bigger view of the city you can go up to the observation point \9000 for adults There is an upscale restaurant at the top where many boyfriends propose to their girlfriends
4064,5,Decided to walk up the hill rather than take the cable car Very nice walk through parkland So peaceful Not too many other walkers at this time so had the opportunity to take pics from wherever  Once reaching the top I was amazed by how the whole love lock phenomenon has taken off here Hundreds of thousands of locks They have even made sculptures out of them  Amazing views of the city and you get a real perspective of how big Seoul is
4065,4,Good views but painful to get to if coming by cable car  so many stairs Place was crowded and the fact people were dropping popcorn everywhere made it seem dirty Also all the sales stands took up space making it harder to get around Overall quite good but can get crowded and was sick of selfie sticks and flashes going off when people dont know how to take photos
4066,4,This is a must when in Seoul You see 360 degrees around the city It gives the scope of how large this city is 10 Million in city 10 Million just outside They have some trinkets and the bathrooms have a great view The walls of millions literally millions of Love locks cover the walls on one side of the tower Must rival ParisThe elevator is an inside elevator and you watch a video in the ceiling while it speeds up and down the shaft
4067,4,Access to the tower could be better as there is around a 200m walk up quite a steep hill with what seemed to be no disabled facilities That said this place has some amazing views It might be worth trying to go during a clear day and even towards the end of the say as we did as the sunset was incredible Cafe with a view if for those that fancy a drink while there
4068,4,Its a great morning hike and a good place to people watch Best on a clear day to see the size of Seoul
4069,5,I visited this tower last Sunday It was surprised how well organized from parking to ticket office  It took us to queue around 1015 minutes Fine Be calm Your cable car would be yours  I qas interested with love bridges where many couples hang their locks on those  Being happy with beautiful area and nice well decor of the tower  I will be back here with my girlfriend next time
4070,5,I know its a cliche bit the view is simply breathtaking Not expensive friendly staff and great surroundings
4071,4,Travelled from Seoul city centre up to the N Seoul Tower by bus before dusk which took an hour due to rush hour traffic A steep up hill climb brought us to the tower base which was hectically crowded with many tourists Just about managed to take a few photos missing heads Paid to go up tower and finish watching the sunset from the 360 degree observation room This also was full of visitors taking photos looking out over Seoul and shopping or sending post cards It was a very busy noisy place Eventually it became quieter and it was possible to view without being pushed and shoved It was great to identify where wed been in the city and where wed stayed Eating places especially revolving restaurant are extremely expensive and require prior booking I would do this visit again at a quieter time of day
4072,5,Went here in the afternoon and evening Took the cAble car ride up Saw a great city view and thousaNds of locks placed on the fences symbolizing a couples undying love for each other
4073,4,Great views good places to eat and tremendous photo oppurtunities The park is good and green Try taking the cable car ride up to the tower A must go when in Seoul
4074,4,Its an uphill climb from the subway station so you can either take a bus taxi or the cable car which cost about 850 dollars round trip Once you get on the base youll see lots of love locks you can buy one from the souvenir shop The view on top is just ok because of the glass windows  If you dont want to pay you cal also get expansive views from the view decks at the base
4075,3,I didnt go up the tower as it was a bit muggy and wouldnt have had a great view From standing at the base of the tower you get some idea at the size of it
4076,4,We went yesterday and really had a great day its not over priced to get the cable car return or one way and walk up or down if your fit The view from the 1st level is terrific but going all the way up to the top of the tower is incredible You can get a meal or snack along with souvenirs up there too Spend the time to sit and just look out from every aspect the view of Seoul is fantastic
4077,4,Heading up N Seoul Tower is a great way to see all of Seoul My friends and I were lucky to go up on a very clear day and had fun finding places we knew
4078,4,You can hike up the mountain if you want or you can take the cable car Oneway on the cable is like 5000w or something like that
4079,5,I love the park with nice greenery Fresh air and breeze even in the hot summer Go in the late afternoon to catch sunset Lovely should not miss
4080,3,touristy beyond belief you get better pictures away from the crowds if you walk back down the hill for 10 minutes to a clearing where there is a nice observation deck
4081,4,Such a notable landmark so you really do need to do this at least once Many nice places for photo opportunities Seen in many dramas the site where all of the locks from couples are We went late at night and didnt have much of a wait time Night view was beautiful though probably day time view would have been better to see all the detail sections of Seoul But we werent really wanting to go so bad that we would stand in line for 2 hours as some of the reviews stated Late night we waited about 10 minutes
4082,4,I was in town with some colleagues and we decided to take a day trip to Seoul tower I recommend visiting if you are in the area the views are spectacular The rest is similar to what you would expect for a tourist area little shops and such Oh and the restaurant in the tower that is uber expensive We didnt feel like submitting an expense report with those prices
4083,5,Take the Namsan Sunhwan shuttle bus No 5 950KRW cash or 850KRW with Tmoneytrip every 15 mins from the bus stop near Myeongdong Station Exit 3 Same bus back to Myeongdong  The view was nice and the locks area was very interesting No need to pay extra to go up to the tower as the view is good enough from the decks  The walk up the hill is steep and may be difficult for elderly
4084,5,i dont know why but taxi driver took us 5km away from tower when we told him we want to go to seoul towerbut because of this we could enjoy little hike
4085,3,Didnt went up but the whole area is very nice great view The cable car was too crowded Nice coffee shops and restaurants
4086,5,One of the best attracts to visit in Seoul The scenery from there is beautiful especially at night The restaurant on top is also nice
4087,4,The place is a must go if you are visiting the first time It is located on a hill so reaching is a bit difficult We took the bus tour that helped usFinally you have to walk around 100 meters high trek to reach the tower but it is worth it  You get a panoramic view of Seoul from this place It is superb If you have time you can go the observatory and get a better view  There is a museum also which we didnt visit due to shortage of time But it should be a must place to visit on your trip
4088,4,The cable car up to the tower was crowded but the view was good Lots of stairs to get to the viewing area Seoul was misty so the view was not as good as I had hoped But the vista was there would look superb at night
4089,4,The view from the base of the tower is fantastic We didnt end up going to the top as we were told it was the same view only higher and what we saw already was great The restaurants around the base are pricey but there are several nice areas to sit and enjoy some food especially if youve brought your own If youre looking for a great view of the city this is a wonderful spot but between the gondola ride up if you choose the ticket to the top and any food you buy at the base it could get pricey Instead bring your own food and water and take a bus as close as it will get you and walk to the base  the walk is very steep though
4090,3,generally n seoul tower is an ordinary telecom tower which offers a set of ordinary stuff to do  location is however a good place from which you can have a 360  view of city if you take the cable car to get to the tower you will save more energy however walking through the dense woods will make a good memory specially if you are a couple by the way in order to get into the cable car u have too stand in long ques  u can leave a memorial by writing your names on a lock and attach it to thousands of locks other lovers have left there
4091,4,We bought our tickets and saw it could come as a package with beer and popcorn So our hands full of snacks and drinks we went up and enjoyed the beautiful views meanwhile enjoying the beer and popcorn As if we were in the movies  We waited till afternoon to go up as otherwise you can hardly see anything We took the cable car which was comfortable and not so pricy for such attractions
4092,3,This was a great place to visit and enjoyed view  The city was hazy that day however could see most of town My daughter and husband really enjoyed lock of loves  I would have rated higher however though site was a little costly for overlook
4093,3,My advice is that do not go to the observation floor because you can see the nightview at the love lock there without spending money Plus you can enjoy the wind outdoor
4094,4,Seoul tower is popular attraction in seoul i think Theres so many couple in there  But worthed to visit  Its so crowded when i going to there maybe because of high season 
4095,4,This is a romantic place mainly for young couples and tourists Couple is able to purchase a set of love padlock from the vendor and then lock onto fences gates and railings Many tourists and couples pose for photos with the Love padlock trees or domes There are several lovey dovey benches in the N Seoul Tower A panoramic view of the city can be seen from the viewing gallery  a really spectacular sight
4096,3,Great view from the observatory but if you wish not to opt for the cable car ride going to the tower be prepared for a tiring hike up the hill where the bus will drop you off During the wintercold season I suggest going here in morningafternoon and not in the evening wherein it is freezing cold
4097,5,Nice  but indeed a long walk from Myeong dong at least 1015mins  have a package dinning on top N Seoul tower Can take a look over must at least tried once when you are in Seoul 
4098,3,Unfortunately for Seoul the views from the tower are often heavily obstructed by pollution Its a rare day when the skies are actually blue and Id only recommend a visit to Seoul Tower on one of those days Otherwise youll barely be able to see the city around you If however you do go on a day when the air is clean youll definitely have a breathtaking view of Seouls mostly boring architecture and the craggy hills that surround it Overall one of the most popular things to do in Seoul but not that special compared to other towers the world over
4099,5,Its honestly better to go at night when its cooler in the summer and to get a great night skyline view During the day the amount of haze in the day can obstruct the view and scale of seoul I hiked up from the haytt hotel It took about an hour of leisure stroll up the hill It was well worth the hike and view Seoul is massive
4100,5,The beauty stands so tall you can see it through out the day and looks awesome in the night There are official timings to visit so better check and visit
4101,4,Seoul tower is like Tokyo tower in japan and Burj Khalifa in dubai Those places are impossible to dont go
4102,5,This place is better visited during night The lights were awesome You can have a great view from the top of the tower
4103,4,We visited the tower during the day and although the views are good the haze over the city does reduce the chance of viewing to a great distance However the views offered are uninterrupted and excellent If you want a bite to eat there are a few different places catering at various prices There are plenty of opportunities that the tower takes to try and have you spend more money but they are your choice and are not stuffed in your face Overall it is worth the small amount to see the view
4104,3,Its splendid view of Seoul from a high peak but would prefer if its open air Long queue to go up and down as only 2 cable cars in operations Nice spot for couples 
4105,4,Worth a visit when in Seoul Major tourist attraction  busy but queues moved quickly when we visited Best go on clear sunny days
4106,4,We walked up to this tower at night Go to the viewing point at the bottom of this tower the sights are just amazing and free  far cheaper than going to the top Be mindful of all the love padlocks and the kissing couples Also just a little hint if you see the colour blue as indicated in the pic the air pollution is good Any other colour well you can work that out for ourselves Also been mindful of the times as the buses up and down can be heaving
4107,5,Great at Sunset with your loved ones Make sure you go on a clear day It is worth every moment It is very easy to access by bus from Itaewon or Yongsan
4108,2,Located on the hill top and can overview the Seoul metro area Can only accessible by Cable car or by walk which is 3060 min Scenery is so so So we save the money not to visit the elevated scenery deck  No attractive attraction on the hill top but the ice cream is nice to try Walk around and take some photo shot so 12 hours should be enough  My daughter is excited though There are a lot of love locks potentially some by celebrities who she fancy of Also it is free to lock so if you are interest bring your own lock may be a good idea
4109,3,There is the potential for a fantastic view of Seoul but when we went the windows were dirty and you couldnt see too well The cable car cab is also very crowded everyone stands up and the views are hidden by wire mesh and other passengers An unexpected bonus was the toilets There is a full length window so when you are stood there doing your stuff there is a beautiful view We discovered the electric street lift on the way down It would have saved a steep walk if we had found it on the way up
4110,4,Board a local bus from Myeongdong towards N seoul tower The trip takes 1015 min depends on traffic and once reach there you will need to hike up so a proper shoes is recommended There is a 7E which can filled you up before the journey up and the view of 360 degrees can take your breath away Remember to buy the love key for couples
4111,4,Review is for a daytime visit It was a bit overcast but still good views My favorite part is the urinals on the floor where you catch the elevators down You can pee while catching a fantastic view
4112,5,Breathtaking view at night Loved that I had the opportunity to write and send a post card from the top of the tower
4113,4,Nice can be walkable from Myeongdong shopping area or near Nine Tree Hotel Skypark hotel 3 amount others closed by hotel Love lock tower nice view up at tower
4114,3,We made the mistake of hiking up the hill to this tower it was a nice but extremely steep walk up in killer humidity There is a lift but we came at it from the wrong direction and never found it so plan it out properly or you will be sorry like we were The tower itself is nothing too special the view is nice and the windows point you in the direction of other countries so thats kind of cool You can send postcards from the top too Dont feel too bad if you miss this Other cities have much better towers
4115,4,You must visit here at night No meaning when you come to the tower during the daylight Please Please purchase ticket to the top even though it is expensive You will see magnificent sight
4116,4,A friend took me around he was so eager to show the pride of koreathe amazing towerAreally wonderful site But l was more facinated wiz the nite shopping esp in the other areas
4117,4,Our group of 4 walked from Myeongdong to the cable car station at Namsan Hill Took us 25minutes The queue for the cable car was relatively short about 10 minutes as it was a Tuesday evening Once out of the cable car you still need to walk up many steps to get to the Seoul tower There are interesting spots for photography You have to pay a fee to get up to the observation deck The night view was lovely The lighted bridges along the Han River were specially awesome The quip was that we couldnt take photos as the light from the shop in the tower casted too much reflection on the glass You can send a postcard back home from there as the shop sells stamps cards and has a post box Overall it was a memorable and fun visit
4118,4,We were in South Korea for a convention and had a half day tour squeezed into our schedule We went to the Seoul Tower  my first time to see this place despite visiting Korea several times already Nice place to go around With the padlocks just like in Paris Beautiful place to take souvenir pictures
4119,5,The must visit place in Seoul Especially to see the beautiful night view Highly recommended
4120,4,It was a hazy day in Seoul but we all thought we couldnt leave without going up the tower and it was definitely worth it Great 360 degree views and helps you understand the layout of the city Take the cable car up the walk looks extremely challenging The park below the tower also has some great spots to get a good view of the city
4121,5,Incredible view of Seoul There is a bus that gets you almost at the top You have to walk up a little bit but man it is so worth it Must stop in tha city
4122,5,I feel like its worth it It IS expensive though I forget exactly how much but around 2030 won per person But its beautiful and if you can afford it I would go
4123,5,Had the opportunity to visit here and the tower was great The view is worth it and having come from regional Australia the view of Seoul blew my mind  it is massive Would recommend a visit
4124,3,When we arrive at 6pm the queue was super long so we decided to walk up But after walking about 1000 steps and we are still 12 km away we gave up We just enjoyed the up close view of the tower romantico
4125,5,Once you see the North Tower you get a spectacular view of the city below  its a neat view one you should definitely wait for the line does get kind of long so be prepared but its well worth the wait
4126,5,Try to pick a clear day or night when visiting the tower as you can get some really good photos We went around 7pm and it was extremely busy so a fair wait to get to there Great atmosphere and quite a few places to eat and drink Next time I would go earlier to see the city late afternoon and at night Well worth spending the money for this attraction
4127,4,Walked up from Itaewan station it was rather uneasy walk as it was long distance and steep walk Definitely not for rather unfit or maybe elderly who do not work out a lot It was a bit better walking through a garden with some cool wind On the peak for an hour and half until 730pm when the vehicles light starts to lights up it was great Took lots of pictures too I think it is a nice place and nice atmosphere in Seoul
4128,4,Always need to get to the highest viewpoint when I visit a new city Seoul Tower rates with the best of them Do yourself a favour and walk from the bottom through the wonderful woods
4129,3,Visited seoul with my daughter We went to the seoul tower Glad we did it was nice to see the city from up there Interesting facts regarding the distance from different countries were displayed there Note there is a long incline that you must walk up to go to the tower The car will only go up so far then it is on you If you have Bad knees or trouble breathing please be careful
4130,5,The tower was absolutely beautiful when lit up at night I provided some great views of the city as well This is a must see
4131,2,If you are first time in Seoul you should go up Seoul N Tower and see how Seoul looks like However due to lots of smog these days tou should try to pick a good weather day to have a clear view Also other than the observation place they have nothing fun
4132,4,This place is crowded with couples I went on a misty day so I didnt go all the way up at the tower There was a pretty nice view from my point nonetheless and it was a nice experience
4133,2,I really dont get the appeal of this placeyes sure the view is nice from the top but the cable cars were terribly full and so was the locationthere were just too many people to really immerse yourself in the experience The tower itself is simply a tower which lights up in different colours its no architectural masterpiece If you plan on walking up to the tower be prepared for a very steep ascent with many steps so bring plenty of water Its quite a hike to the top but great exercise Id much rather go to one of the citys amazing art exhibitions than see this overcrowded attraction
4134,3,The tower is cool but it is pretty expensive and DEFINITELY meant for couples Everything is couple oriented so keep that in mind before you go
4135,4,A nice place to go to when youre with your loved one A lightfilled view of Seoul locks that make you feel like you are in Paris Seoul Tower infuses modern and traditional culture all in one
4136,3,Its expensive going up and if you ride the cable car up to N Seoul platform you get the same views  Well Id youre a couple and want to lock up your love there then I guess thats kind of neat but once youve done it in Paris you dont need to do it anywhere else  Go if you wantit wasnt for me I could have settled for just riding the cable car up and downbut then I did have to wait in line for a long time to ride either way  Meh
4137,4,The tower itself a definite tourist attraction but it was a fun detour on the Seoul Fortress walk Walking up and down the mountain is a great workout There are shops and restaurants at the base of the tower You can of course lock your love up there too If its hot out you can enjoy an ice cream cone from Cold Stone Creamery and then run through the fountains to cool off The tower is a little pricy and there are some nice souvenirs to purchase
4138,5,We have tons of family and friends visiting us here in Seoul and we always ask them at the end of their stay what the top 5 places where that we took them This one is always in the top 3 next to the DMZ and maybe one otherdepending on their taste The Cable Car ride is fun and to spend some time walking around the top of the tower and showing family all the places in Seoul well its just an awesome place to go Dont leave it out even if you only have a day or two or even just several hours here in Seoul It is a Must See
4139,5,Its a good place to visit also in bad or cold days Just be sure for a clear sights   Both cable car and nice square and lifts in tower
4140,5,N Seoul Tower is a great attraction but you can get great views of the city from the several viewpoints around the foot of the tower Theres no need to pay to go all the way up unless you really want to
4141,5,Be prepared for a pretty steep inclined walk to the tower Appropriate footwear recommended Once up there though its spectacular 360 degree view of Seoul with amazing photo opportunities Restaurants and sweet shop also available at the top of the tower
4142,5,One of the most interesting visits we have had while weve been in Seoul was for sure the seeing of the Seoul Tower It is located in the vast Seoul park named Namsan Park The park is to the south from the financial residential and trading zone of the city We arrived there by bus from our Biwon Hotel Otherwise it is possible to take the Namsan cable car up the MtNamsan to walk to the tower It is a really national landmark and also renowned for its cityscape The height of MtNamson is 243 meters and the top of the tower is on 237 meters above the ground There are four observation levels from whom You may have the fascinating views of the Seoul The tower has got the communication and observation purpose It provides the radio and TV broadcasting in Seoul Constantly very well visited by the masses of the tourists and residents especially during nighttime when the tower lights up I warmly recommend to be there when in Seoul
4143,4,My second visit to Korea and I finally saw the N Seoul Tower It was chilly the night I decided to go there but I still enjoyed it The views are spectacular and are well worth the uphill hike and cable car ride to the tower Theres a souvenir shop inside too I didnt get to see this place the first time I came to Korea so Im glad I finally did it
4144,3,With the amount of time it took us to get there lone lines and amount of people there this place was beyond disappointing I dont know why so many people insist on going here Now that Ive been to the observation deck which is over priced in my opinion Id like to say dont waste your time money or energy going to N Seoul Tower There are better things to do and see in Seoul  Problems 1 Getting There sure you can take the cable cars but from what Ive read theyre expensive they pack you in like sardines and the trek there isnt easy OR you could cram yourself onto the bus might actually be the best idea looking back wish we would have done this OR you walk the taxi driver dropped us off as close as he could get and let me tell you it was farther than we thought we crammed ourselves on a bus when we left 2 Way way way too many people I think I complain about this everywhere I go in Seoul but this was worse because the space was so small 3 The price for going up just for a view of Seoul is a bit excessive Then again if it was any cheaper Im sure theyd have even MORE people coming to this place 4 The view is good only IF its a clear day which I find to be rare in Seoul Between the smograiny weatheryellow dust good luck
4145,4,The view at the top is facinating You can just walk your way up there if you want so They got few cafes and a classy restaurant with a gr8 Seoul view where you can chill out a bit
4146,5,the famous corner is the Love Locks fence You can get 360 Seoul city view from the tower This is my second time here Beautiful at night
4147,4,Without a doubt a must for any trip to Seoul Yeah its a major tourist attraction with lots of kids on school field trips and family outings but it got this popular for a reason What a view You can really see just how MASSIVE Metropolitan Seoul has become and how beautiful the mountains and valleys are
4148,4,we got lock there LOL hope that we visit there again someday the Nseoul tower must visit place that a great to see the city 360 degree from above
4149,4,Namsan tower is a must see for anyone visiting Seoul On a clear day rare in the Summer unfortunately you can get a fantastic view of the city and the park is a lovely place to walk around
4150,5,Well I went there at an Wednesday at night I got so emotinal with the view yjay I cryed By far my favorite place in the city So romantic so pretty so Seoul
4151,3,Tower is pricier than we expected and it was surprisingly poor visibility at the top We thought views were equally as nice from Namsan park  If you decide to go upsunset is a beautiful it popular time  get there much earlier than you think is necessary especially if by cable car ad the line backs up quickly  Best to take the bus to the top which runs frequently straight to the top since taxis cant go up Bus stops running earlier though so plan to walk or take cable car back down mountain if youll be there later than 9
4152,4,Up there you can see the whole Soul Wonderfull view specially in the evening  You can walk up orand down if you want some exercise and then its allso free of charge
4153,4,I guess its one of the landmarks that youve got to see when traveling to Seoul Unfortunately it was cloudy so we couldnt totally appreciate the view We only had two days We took the cable car up the hill to the base of the tower and walked down 30C which was quite nice even though we paid for round trip At the base of the tower there were traditionally clothed guards which was nice
4154,3,I was there in September 2014 even though I havent been to the top of the tower yet but the atmosphere surrounding the tower was fabulous  My friend and I took a bus from the station I forgot the name already and left the bus at the Ntower station It is an uphill street which you have to walk till you reach the tower  I did not enjoy the view that much but the atmosphere was impressive Families couples and friends were enjoying their moment together at the tower  So I just fall in love with the atmosphere not the tower itself But such a good place to go indeed
4155,5,I love a view and this is the best in Seoul A 360 degree breathtaking view overlooking the city of Seoul Well worth the visit  Take a tour bus and hike up the walk way or park and ride the tram Both are enjoyable and get you to the same spot  Bring a lock or if youve forgotten purchase one at the gift shop Then lock onto one of the many chain link fences with yours and a loved ones named penned or engraved into the lock  A wonderful tradition and so fun for all And they have an awesome gift shop Send postcards home and take lots of pictures
4156,5,Visited this some time back in February super cold and SUPER long queues forming the bottom of the hill But its worth all the wait You get to view entire of Seoul and its just simply amazing
4157,4,A bit of a walk up to the tower but all worth it once youre there The view of Seoul is breathtaking from the tower
4158,5,i like night view more than day view to be honest air in seoul is not the best so you might have to check sky before decide to go there going up hill by walk can be challenging i usually take cable car to go up and step down but if you are wearing hills probably not a good idea
4159,4,Cant see what earlier people keep complaining about We walked to the top from myeong dong station Took about 3040 min up Yes is was a warm day thats why we used extra long time on the way up Get in shape people
4160,5,One of the best things to do in SK Finding the cable car station that takes you up the mountain was no problem you can walk up but thats a tad ambitious  There are lots of things to do even before you head up the tower restaurants some stores and of course you can leave your mark with a padlock There were no queues anywhere for anything it was brilliant The view from the top was worth the admission fee stunning I would love to go again at night A must see
4161,5,We took the rail car to the top to view the tower but seeing the locals taking the hike up the stairs made me vow to work for my view the next time around My toddler especially liked the candy shop and optical illusion museums up top
4162,4,The Seoul Tower in Namsam park really does offer amazing views of the city I didnt actually go up thought because you can get great views from the base but Seoul was surprisingly a little smoggy  The reason I dont give it a full 5 stars is because its very touristy and there are much nicer places to get beautiful views of the city of course they may require a bit of hiking but I think its worth it
4163,4,If you live in Myeongdong you can literally walk to the cable car station to visit the Namsan mountain where the N Seoul Tower sits If you have also taken the seoul city tour bus ride you can get tickets to the N Seoul Tower on discounted prices
4164,5,You can get a 360 view of the city and this is the center point of the city Price is ok Try to go around 6pm to get the best of the views
4165,5,I went two time nothin the morning and the view is great although I think the night scene on the top of the hill if Nam San should be very good too Both taking cable car and bus are convenient to coming up but I felt taking bus is better for elderly and not much slop needed for going up to station
4166,5,the place is an open area with enough fresh air and space meet face to face and get medical 420 email ryanray5050gmailcom
4167,5,You can see it while riding a subway or up close It is beautiful But I recomend seeing it from afar it is very crowded therefore BIG lines
4168,3,Not the highest tower in the world but is a good place to visit early I your trip to Seoul gives a good sense of what is a huge city  Interesting indicators of distance to various cities  Art show of minimal interest
4169,3,Good view and good tower in the heart of the Seoul city There is a park nearby called Namsan park
4170,5,My friends and took the shuttle as far as we could then walked to the tower They change the color of which its lighted daily and its gorgeous You can see it from All over the city We took the lift to the top I added a lock commemorate my husband and me to the hundreds of thousands of love locks up there The view of Seoul is spectacular A must
4171,3,N Seoul Tower is located on a hill in the centre of Seoul We took the Namsan Cable Car gondola up to the top We expected a great view from the sightseeing platform and it was a great view  Definitely a must see when visiting Seoul if you have enought time  Make sure to bring your own padlocks too
4172,4,Nice location Would have been a 5 if there was fog free We took a walk up to the cable car station from our hotel Sejong 17000 won for a 2 persons roundtrip ticket 20000 won for a combine ticket to the upper observationdeck included 2 drinks and a popcorn
4173,5,We went to the Seoul tower in the late afternoon as we wanted to view the skylines in the evening Beautiful view of Seoul Seoul Tower can be accessible through Myeong Dong We were walking around Myeong Dong and decided to visit the tower impromptu  First you have to get to the cable cartram to get you to the Seoul Tower uphill We took the long and uncomfortable way of walking up through their residences on a very very steep hill to the cable car station The correct way to reach the cable car station is actually through the movable tramlooks more like a movable lift where you have to press the buttons up and you will reached the cable car station From there the cable car will take you up to Seoul Tower For us it was a relax one as there were few people Guessed it has to do with the Mers outbreak in Korea We only took 10minutes to wait for the cable car and another 5 minutes to reach to the top Once you reached the top you have to climb steps up to Seoul Tower Slowly enjoy this while you can as you can gasp the view of Seoul and take photos along the way There were vendors selling locks which you could buy and write your and your loved ones names on it and lock it There are lots of locks there Once we reached the top of the hill there are the ticketing counter restaurants icecream cafes gifts shops pharmacy We went around the deck surrounding the tower to take photos of the scenery before heading up to the tower Once we are up in the tower we are mesmerized by the spectacular view We took many photos up there and had our teabreak at the cafee TwoSome The most beautiful scene I had captured are taken from the restroom The restroom is very clean and had a beautifully unblock view of the Seoul City Recommended to visit the tower during late afternoon to evening to catch the sunset Its lovely 
4174,5,Easy to get to from the subway Take the trolly car up if you dont have a car Plenty to do at the base of the tower We went to the burger joint and was good food The top of the tower was fun and had the distance to major cities around the world on the windows There are locations to put love locks on trees and fences Locks can be bought at the base of the tower for 10k to 20k won if you dont have one
4175,4,I love the view from the top On your way up highly recommend to take the cable car you will be able to see Seoul In the top you can lock your love chain lock It was a very nice refreshing weather on the top
4176,5,I really loved the view of Seoul you can see just how vast it is The only disappointing part is at the top the shop is very bright which causes the glass to reflect So you have to be right against the glass to see out obviously a night time problem
4177,4,I proposed to my wife here So its quite a meaningful place to me The walk to the tower is a quite long so if youre not in the mood or dress for a climb then I suggest you take the bus The bus comes routinely at the foot of the hill where the tower is situated Once you get to the top of the hill you will be able to see the views restaurants and also live performances To get into the actual tower you have to pay a fee and wait in the long line to get to the very top floor So if you not one for lines go on a weekday its usually not that busy on a weekday The scenery surrounding the tower is quite nice and there are various walkingjogging courses you can take to reach the tower It is also connected to a park Many of my friends living in Korea like to come here because there are not many places in Seoul where you can enjoy open nature All in all its one of our top tourist destinations and not one to be missed
4178,5,Honestly I wasnt expecting much as there is so many of these views and towers around the world A friend of mine took me there in the evening and after a while of waiting to get up the most spectacular view Ive ever had in my life appeared Seoul is an incredible metropolis and the experience of seeing all those lights from the top felt almost incredible I think I will have this picture in front of my eyes forever 
4179,5,A must see for spectacular panoramic views of Seoul I recommend the climb up towards the Tower if you are relatively fit as the path is serene and you can watch people walking jogging and interacting amidst the calm surrounds
4180,5,I visited Asia during the Summer of 2012 I finally did visit Seoul Korea on a 12hour stopover from Cambodia It was a nice place to visit The view at the top was great
4181,5,The views from the top of the N Seoul Tower defy description  in every direction you look almost every scrap of land that is not mountain or river has been taken over by skyscrapers and highrise apartments It is amazing to see how Seoul goes on forever even when you think the horizon cant spread any further The admission fee was affordable and well worth it for the incredible views from the top I visited in the early afternoon in late June and there were no crowds at all A highlight of a visit to Seoul
4182,3,You must not visit at night time otherwise you will not be able to see the view as the glass reflects the interior light So please visit during the day for a greater experience  But still it has a great view however I was not able to enjoy much because the windows reflect and there were a lot tourists in a small area
4183,4,I booked a tour to do this so the bus drove us up to a certain point and we walked the other half up The hill is very steep You will get a great workout I do not recommend doing this when it is extremely warm in Korea as the humidity is very high and if you not accustomed to it could cause you great harm  I was looking forward to seeing the N Seoul Tower from the minute of booking my trip to Seoul I booked a nite trip with Koridoor we stopped at other locations as well as the NSeoul Tower The elevator ride up was great I LOVED the view from up there however trying to take photos were hard because of the glare off the glass so that ruined it for me because I couldnt get the great shots that I wanted to get If taking pictures really isnt at the top of your list then YES it is a must see other than that go in the day time and the glares from the indoor lights may not affect your pictures as much as the night time views  Before going up on the tower there is some areas to sit around and some shops to purchase foodsnacks such as Coldstone They also have the love lock area You can purchase a lock from inside the gift store and put a lock on there The view from there reminds of looking out over any city at night It was great but nothing like looking at it from the Tower itself
4184,5,We had a great time here Theres a restaurant at the top of the tower but its reservations only So we ate at a hamburger place also at the top of the tower The food was better than we expected for a mini food court We also had our picture taken I dont remember the cost but its a great souvenir We walked from our hotel to the tower and it was a great walk The tower is on a hill so if you are not used to walking then I would not recommend it However if you are in decent shape then thats the way to go The views of Seoul as you are walking up the hills are pretty cool We were passed up a few times by some ajumas These ladies walk up these hills and when they get to the top they keep working out in a little park We were sweating by the time we made to the tower On the way back down we took the cable car All in all it was a great experience for us
4185,4,Great night scene and worth checking out if you are in Seoul Great view but depends on the level of clouds  smog how much you can see
4186,5,Ive been to seoul tower 4 times now and each time I love it more and more The views from seoul tower are amazing Every visitor weve had we take to seoul tower and they love it just as much as we do This last time we went we did the love lock and it was so fun to lock our love in seoul They have many great restaurants and souvenir shops up there as well
4187,3,Expected the Seoul Tower to be pretty high Perhaps because it was located on a hill the tower itself didnt seem very high It was kind of odd to see people buying buckets of popcorn and drinks and heading up the tower Perhaps looking at the view was like watching a movie Unfortunately the day we went up it was rather hazy so could really get a clear view of Seoul
4188,4,Seoul Namsan Tower is one scenic spot in Seoul you need to visit For families couples or group of friends this can be a fun experience and a memorable place to be You can see the overview of the city and some landscapes around the area People tend to go there starting around 4pm to see the sunset and the lights of the city  Restaurants are available with quite fair prices location is good for photography and transportation comes in two ways by bus and by cable car  Butwhen you plan to go there on holidays or weekends be prepared for a veryyy loongggg lineeeeeee Patience my friends  Thats all for nowThanks for reading
4189,5,N Seoul Tower is located on a hill in the centre of Seoul When standing next to the tower it was not that impressive but placed on a hill the view from the sightseeing platform is great There are basically two ways to get to the tower The long and curvy asphalt road or climbing the narrow paths on the hillside If you have time climbing the hillside is a great experience
4190,5,first time me and my husband where at seoul tower vas in the afternoon we decided to stay for dinner it was so romantic to sit and eat with this beautiful view the food was ok but not more than ok the bathrooms are really macnificent and a must to visit i have been back at the tower sseverals times after my first and I am still overvelmed by the view
4191,5,A must go sightseeing spot in Seoul We my friends and I took the bus to n Seoul tower then climb a steep slope Though climbing up is a bit tiring but it worth after seeing the spectacular night view Strongly recommend to pay a visit
4192,3,Take away the locks the green screen and the souvenir photos and this experience would be great Before you even start the walk up the hill you are guided to a convenience store where you can buy a lock to attach to the fence Not necessary We went at night and the views were lovely It was the hard sales atmosphere that made the experience more like a visit to a kids amusement park So different than the other beautiful attractions in Seoul
4193,4,We took the Namsan Cable Car gondola up to the top The area around the tower has a few restaurants and is also home to the Love padlocks piles of padlocks with love notes attached to the surrounding fences Great view from the tower Well worth a visit
4194,5,Definitely a must see when visiting Seoul Going up might require some steps on a steep slope but its all worth it Make sure to bring your own padlocks too
4195,5,we arrive to the n seoul tower more for more curiosity and we were in shock with the city view and all the entertainment offer the area
4196,5,I honestly dont know why this has so many negative reviews My wife and I went here and had a blast We hiked to the base of the tower which was a nice walk through the park We then paid 20 USD for the ticket to the top plus a couple sodas and a popcorn Honestly for a big tourist activity thats quite cheap We didnt have to wait on any kind of queue and we went on a Sunday afternoon Went to the top had some amazing views of the city and even mailed our parents a post card in the US for a few dollars  Its definitely touristy And parts of it are tacky But its not very expensive and you get amazing views of the city
4197,4,A must to see at night to get a sense of the size of the city Must be in shape to climb the 200 steps to get to the elevator to get to the top of the tower No wheelchair ramps or other opportunities other than the steps So be prepared if you are a Senior travelor with mobility issues
4198,4,Its a nice tower like any other tower in any other city BUT please use the mens restroom You can do your stuff and view the city at the same time Very relaxing feeling  This is what differs Seoul tower from the other city towers 
4199,3,You can see whole sight of Seoul on the top of N Tower And the restaurant in there which its tables go round with floor is not bad
4200,5,The sunset is amazing  I would recommend visiting around 30 min before the sunset time to watch the city transition from day into night The ticket prices were relatively inexpensive and I enjoyed the cable car to get up to the main area
4201,5,On a summerlong trip to South Korea my friends and I spent some time in Seoul We headed over to the tower because its almost like the Big Ben of Seoul  Before and after going up we looked around at the love locks where couples from all around the world lock padlocks onto a fence and throw the key away Ive seen this in a few counties before but didnt expect to see it here for some reason It was very nice  I will note that I visited in the evening and this is certainly the time is suggest you go also to get the maximum wow  We went up the tower and the view was spectacular Its not often you get to see a city from above at night apart from when youre flying  Id say this is a must see if youre going to Seoul
4202,5,Great sight to see Amazing view of Seoul from the top Its about 8USD to get to the top of the tower If not prepare for a good workout climbing a bunch of stairs
4203,3,Went to N Seoul Tower when my wife came to visit last year it was a hazy day so the view was not too great We took the cable car so it that was nice We had dinner at Chibochima an Italian restaurant good food and price was great Window to see out made for a nice time
4204,5,This building has a spectacular view of the Seoul Metro area day or night The is a nice but rather expensive restaurant on the top but a good cafeteria lower down Other entertainment venues The ride to the top is memorable as well This is one of the best things you can do in the city and a perfect complement to the bus tour Have fun
4205,3,Everyone said n Seoul tower is a mustgo spot in Seoul However when I got there I felt it was just okay especially the view from the tower It is true that I could see the whole city from the tower but there is seriously nothing much to see Probably that was because I didnt visit at the right time And the visit was quite short because the tower is not big either But the view under the tower is pretty cool I love the scenery under the tower a lot And you can breath the fresh air there
4206,3,The tower is pretty and you can see it from almost all over Seoul But the price to get to the top is a little high it is just a tower with a view over Seoul If you do go up I recommend the cable car Its only a short ride but its fun
4207,2,Went during the spring and was carrying high hopes as many reviewers stated it is beautiful that it may surprise me to capture its beauty But was very disappointed it was concealed and couldnt view much We queued for more than 3hrs plus just to go up to the tower to find disappointments imo not worth 
4208,3,The only spectacular here is the view of the city from the observation deck Still a must see for this alone
4209,5,We decided to go up before sunset to get nice pictures of the city during the sunset so we went to the elevator about 25 hours before sunset Turned out that after the elevator we queued for there was another elevator and another one and then we were just underneath the Seoul tower So we still needed to go up the tower itself do I need to tell that by the time we were at this point on top of the mountain the sun had set few hours ago already So going up the hill where the tower is is one part of the journey and costs two elevator tickets and after that you buy the ticket to get up the tower Here you have the same problem I find lots of sightseeing towers to have the glasses are round and in the middle of the tower theres a souvenir shop which lights up the whole room so if you try to take a picture you end up having nothing but background light in it The view is nice tho but you get almost the same view on the bottom of the tower up on the hill and definitely better pictures there as well Save the money and buy a heart shaped lock to but on the love lock walls on top of the hill
4210,4,Seoul Tower is a Seoul Landmark since it was opened to the public in 1980 The main attractions include a digital observatory a roof terrace shop gifts and 2 restaurants at the top  To arrive at the entrance of the tower you have to deserve it the parking lot is situated in env 1km and since the it one rose on foot and vertiginous who waits for you  The prices for the tower vary in function if you want to eat or not in one of the two restaurants  In the end I would say that it is an attraction to be seen just to take the pictures of the sight which has a 360 degree panoramic view of the city but except that nothing more
4211,4,The view here was exquisite The price was not that bad either You can get a promotion if you come in groups I bought a ticket with pop corn and soft drink with it
4212,4,We went there in mid morning there are a lot of padlocks for love and considering MERS outbreak quite crowded too The view is great It is worth to visit
4213,5,My family enjoyed the trip to N Seoul Tower on our own no tour guide Going up I got tired because the road was so steep but when we got to the tower it was awesome You can see Seoul in 360 degrees Even the elevator ride was enjoyable My daughters hanged their padlocks with notes in them And got some nice remembrance too
4214,4,Expansive view of Seoul  both sides of the Han river  from the observation deck The walk up the hill is definitely also worth it if youre into hiking
4215,5,If you go by public transport be aware that you need to walk steadily uphill for quite a distance to reach the cable car platform A cable car transports you to the base of the tower Otherwise take a taxi to the table car platform  i recommend to go 1 hour before sunset to get a day time view a spectacular sunset and a night time view
4216,4,We took the cable car up to N Seoul Tower and were amazed with the views from the top Beneath the tower they were doing a photo shoot with panda figures to raise awareness of the 1600 pandas remaining in the world The Trick Museum and the observatory were worth visiting and the souvenirs available on top were also very nice and interesting It is an attraction in Seoul that we will visit again next time
4217,4,Short queue for the cable car during Mers PackageHan Cook Dinnersemibuffet  Seoul Tower ticket We enjoy the food and the spectacular view from Seoul Tower  Lovers Locks form a sweet picture
4218,3,It was easy to go to the Tower Food was available And the view was grand I am senior so I really didnt like much walking
4219,4,Nice city view especially in the evening However we queue over 2 hours for cable ride maybe peak season  When we visited there they have mini music concert with good atmosphere In fact it has a big area for walking besides tower Love locks are found over the fence  romantic human interactive tourism
4220,3,we went there by cable car and for n seoul tower entry ticket they give a foreigner special discount 10 which you could downloaded it on visit korea app  tmoney coupon the best view is at night but unfortunatelly you couldnt watch the lock love bridge so i suggest you go there by afternoon taking picture on lock love background then continue with n seoul tower observasion deck to watch seoul at night you could also have dinner  dessert time with cold stone  burger there are several option which quite expensive but still reasonable price
4221,3,Checked out the Tower on June 24th 2015 Very easy to access using one of the tour buses Its about 1300 won or 125 USD Although pic a day that is clear when we stayed forecast was Haze everyday but we went regardless Its obviously a great view being up so high once at the top of the there are plenty of picture opportunities there also decent pictures to be taken at the base of the tower Also the guys washroom is great because the urinals have the most amazing view youve ever had while reliving yourself We went on a weekday i think its slightly cheaper than the weekend but really our currency is valued much higher than theirs so most everything is relatively inexpensive There is also a tram that can take you up and down we decided to take it down and it was an ok view 6000 won one way per person
4222,5,In my first time trip to Korea I went here you have to walk a little bit not accord to people that doesnt have good physical condition there is a love lock wall where you and your SO can lock your love  At the top of the tower is a little store where you can buy souvenirs and see all the city Its amazing
4223,4,I went with my mum on a cold night Fog was everywhere but decided to take the risk and head up Caught the cable car to the tower Only a 15 minute walk from our hotel Nine Tree in Myeongdong We waited about an hour for the fog to dissappear then paid to go up Again waited a while inside for the fog to go Only a restaurant and a few coffee bars inside Not much else to do inside other than the gift shop Saw a review on TripAdvisor that said the best view was from the ladies toilets Strange thing to say but so true  The view from outside was just as impressive The amount of love padlocks there was overwhelming; being a kdrama fan made being there even more special The view of Seoul was stunning and worth the cold wait 
4224,5,A great place to go if you want to see whole Seoul The view there is spectacular Restaurant that is there  rotates so that during your meal you can enjoy this great view
4225,4,Popular point is seoul Beautiful view to take photo at night and the weather is so good even i went there on May Easy to go i took the bus at Myeongdong just 900krw cheaper than cable car i reccomend you to go there by bus
4226,4,Good view especially at night great for lovers too But beware of cold weather Went there a few times and everytime a different feel Can walk all the way up or you can also take public transport there too
4227,3,Tourist trap Has been always will be The only thing it has going for it is that every major city has their prerequisite phallic symbol that tourists have to check off This is Seouls version Its been around for ever and they did a good enough job of cleaning it up and nice enough to visit but is it worth it Nope The Namsam mountain and the park around it on the other hand is worth visiting and strolling around Its dog friendly too
4228,4,If you are visiting Seoul I would definitely recommend a trip up the N Tower for the view We went on a smoggy day but it was still enjoyable
4229,4,I enjoyed my solo visit to the tower It took a lot of uphill walking and hiking from the main street to get to the Towers entrance Its a nice cutesy place that couples would enjoy It had a lot of photo ops for romantic couples Go both day and night to experience the sights and city lights
4230,4,This was a great evening The tower is situated in the middle of Namsan Park and is really easy to get to by bus The fee is only around 10000 won to get to the observation deck of the tower I recommend going to the top at night time The 360 panoramic view of Seoul is outstanding The city at night looks so futuristic and youll find yourself staring in awe for an hour Only downside is that its difficult to take decent photos through the window due to the reflection of the lights inside the observation deck Definitely visit the tower
4231,4,The most popular pointa love pointto see down seouli really enjoyed my visit thereas I walked all the way upthat I almost had to buy the pictures they took for mething which I did not really like
4232,5,Something that you can see from any place in Seoul almost from any angle it is a beautiful site I recommend the package that includes two drinks popcorn and two tickets to the top It is a huge tourist attraction but worth the views you get You can get better pictures around the tower if your looking for a city view but if you have time defiantly make a trip to the top there is a petty steep heal ofter being dropped off by your ride
4233,3,Ive been here once before so I knew what to expect But I didnt get that Maybe their budget was cut or maybe it was MERS to blame but  The exhibition one of those live art deals where you can be a part of the art was quite lame I guess it was exactly as described but the atmosphere was empty and theres just not much excitement to have when you can really only do the pose they show you nothing unique about your experience  Then theres a SECOND hall which looked totally devoid of people and I can see why One is enough  Going up to the observatory and you get the good views Ive been up enough buildings to know this is your bog standard deal I actually found the 63 building view to be far superior because youre closer to stuff for viewing not up a mountain the 63 building is in a place where you can see all the traffic and detail and its such an unpopular tourist attraction nowadays it takes no time and you get to see all round So maybe check that out instead  When I left I expected the scheduled lights display on the Seoul Tower which when I was there a few years back came with music and 3d laser stuff and animations on the floor This time I got what seemed to be 3 minutes of silent advertisement on the tower and nothing else What an incredible disappointment I was building up to that moment the whole time I can only hope it was a oneoff thing due to MERS  Getting back down is hugely inconvenient since there are no taxis or buses so you have to get this weird elevator down a side cliff onto the road and walk 15 minutes or so to the subway And there were no directions or instructions on how to do that; I had to ask a car park ticket officer
4234,4,As the time I went Korea was still fighting with MERS so this tower was not crowded and I abled to sit down and enjoy the view for quite a long timeThe elevator was very creative and made you filled up the boring waiting timeI suggest people to go at evening because you can enjoy both night and day time scenery but I think the night time scenery is the most amazing sceneryI also suggest you guys to take the cable car if you return from Namsan at night because the mountain road was very dark
4235,3,While the Seoul Tower in its ever changing colored lights looks beautiful and intriguing from afar I was disappointed when actually standing on the 777 foot structure Perhaps it was the timing of the season and or day but I felt it was a flop at the top We decided to hike up the winding road full with the beauty of nature Upon reaching where the buses park for transport up and down the mountain there is a small convenient store and restrooms before you enter into the attraction Another steep pavement hike and we had arrived Ice cream and other food vendors were plentiful along with a gift shop There were several locks of love art projects structured like Christmas trees on one side and a stage on the other Unfortunately there were no acts during this time period There is an observatory higher up with a view that would not disappoint on a clear day I dont know if it was the smog of pollution fogging up the view the day I visited or the clouds At best though even through the smog you can see the outlines of buildings for what seems like forever in the grand city of Seoul
4236,5,The cable car was a fun experience as you got to see Seoul spread out in front of you the higher you went The locket fence was a sight to see as it is literally FILLED with locks of love
4237,5,i think it is the highest building in the city  very nice architect and around the tower there are millions of locks for lovers 
4238,4,Its a good place to visit in Seoul its perfect for the bird eye view especially the cable ride is worthy
4239,5,Awesome chow lots of food strak was very good loved the atmosphere drink was as good as can be an 2m was good n fruity
4240,3,It was nice to see Seoul from such a high point but other than that I found the experience to be a bit too touristy
4241,4,We didnt go in the tower but its a great visual to know where you are when out walking and sightseeing
4242,4,Go up in the evening Have a little dinner at the base of the cable car entry Take the ride up and watch the sunset and the people Take a padlock to add to the Lovers fence near the base of the tower
4243,3,If the weather is not clear I dont feel this is worth it at all We took the cable car to the top of the hill It was in February so it was a bit cold outside to be hiking around Otherwise we would probably have walked to the top It was a neat experience for the teens and me since we had never been in a cable car before There were Love Lock Trees at the top base of the tower They sell Love Locks there but you could bring your own for cheaper There is an elevator to the top of the Tower There is a post office at the top of the tower so you can send post cards that will have the N Seoul Tower postmark on it There is also a gift shop on top as well  Visited Feb 2013
4244,4,You can buy a one way or round trip tickets A big cable car ride can store up to 30 people maxper time  You should eat at the restaurant if you are hungry next to N tower though it was ok not good But it was very crowded since not many ones around the area You have to wait to get a table esp at weekends  Walking up the tower is interesting you can see the whole view of Seoul city It was amazing with fresh air Make sure you buy a locker to proclaim your love with your beloved ones I love the colourful lockers with different sizes and designs there
4245,5,The view from Seoul N tower was absolutely incredible Take the elevator from Namsan tunnel 3 to the cable car and walk up the wooden steps in Namsan park to the base of the tower Pay for the 30 second elevator ride to the observation deck and check out the view Go on a sunny day for the best view but I understand that the view at night is also cool
4246,5,Loved every minute of the cable car ride up the elevator to the top of the tower the love lockets that you can buy and proclaim your love and oh the views They even have Cold Stone Creamery at the top Buy a one way ticket only and you can hike down and see the most lush forests and walking paths ever Even ran into an Archery field where some men were practicing Take your time walking down and you will make it just fine although several stairs in some places Was a highlight of trip to Seoul Big tip be sure to go on a clear day We did and it made all the difference
4247,5,This is one of popular destination in Seoul  Make sure to go to this place but I would suggest visiting the place while the sun is out and also at the night time From the top you will be able to see the City  It gives a different view in the night  I think its more romantic in the night because you will be able to see the lights of the buildings Make sure to buy locks and lock it  Its not expensive anyway
4248,4,Go up the tower and look at the sprawling city beneath you Many things will catch your eye The hill is quite steep so dont wear high heels There are a bunch of nice view points at the top and of course places to eat
4249,5,Seoul is the only city in this world where I can find people who love to wear couple shirts They celebrate their love by writing their names in a padlock and put it in their love locks located beside the NamSam Tower Try their icecream its so Good You can also see a good view of the whole stretch of korea
4250,5,We loved this place Stayed for about 3 hours just sightseeing and taking pictures Lots of gift stores and restaurants to try out There are people there who can take your picture of you in front of the tower we had a selfie stick and that didnt work out haha Great attraction and the view from the top is amazing You have to go up to the observation deck itll cost you around 9 per person but it is worth it
4251,4,It takes some patience to get up to the mountain as you are not the only one that wants to go by cable cart However once you get to the top of the mountain you get spectacular views of Seoul and it was well worth the wait It is a great place to relax and enjoy the views of Seoul with a beer or two
4252,3,It is an average place where you will get seoul city view from the tower Other than that it is not offering anything
4253,5,N Seoul Tower is a must for anyone that visits Seoul I took the cable car up which was nice but had to wait 2 hours After the cable car theres still a little bit of walking to do but its nothing The view from the top is amazing Im sure the walk up would have been nice but I just didnt have the energy as I was in myeongdong for hours prior to walking to the cable car  Theres a shop there but I wouldnt recommend buying anything there because its quite expensive compare to shops around namsan  This is a must It was worth the wait and Im sure it is also worth the sweat if you hike up
4254,5,I went to the Seoul Tower a week ago and had alot of fun looking down at the city of Seoul If you ever go to South Korea you HAVE to do this its only 9000 Won to go up and look aroundwhich is basically around 9 American Dollars
4255,4,It is one of the must see places when you are in Seoul You can almost see the entire city from the top
4256,5,We arrive at the bottom of the hill get the toilet tehre is convinient store nearby and then walk up the hill The view is stunning when I come about 3pm as the lighting i snice for photos with trees and Seoul city as the view you will get a lot of photos on the way up Upside we got NSeoul Tower and we queue for the lift buy ticket already pose for some photos and up the imaginary lift as it will make you feel take a journey to the space On the Observation deck is soso like other deck to view the city Please check the store here we can mail a post card or buy some souvenirs which is nice and good quality like miniature pad for you to write or put picture and place on the wall music box and some travel kit like jacket holder nice flip totte bag Ok finish we go down and get another store to find lock pad if you dont bring They have Lovelock tree and wall and you need to find a place to put on your own there so many padlocks here with message and pictures Enjoy the view again take picture with colorful lock pad taste some ice cream and do some shopping and walk down again to your vehicle Been here several times and never get bored Some times they also have show in here I remember watch it the other time Copules do your best with your love lock 
4257,4,Great views of the city go late afternoon for both day and night time views Amazing to see all the love locks on the fencing would have to be in the hundreds of thousands Lovely city and the people delightful
4258,3,The cable car ride was short but it was scenic You have to pay to ride the cable car and then again to go to the top of the tower so expect to spend some money Theres tons of places to take pictures and little vendors to buy gifts I loved the love locket fences You can hike up or down to the tower as well made shaded paths
4259,5,Took a noon climb Should have been there before sunset to enjoy both sunset and the night view of the city Ticket price could be on the high side
4260,4,N Seoul tower is on top of a hill and to reach the top of the tower one can take a high speed lift The view from top is fantastic Please visit the following Blog httppapumashiblogspotin
4261,5,IMPORTANT Try to get up the tower at around 530 so you can enjoy the sunset over the city its the best time to do contemplate Seouls landscape The entire experience of going to the top of the tower is very fun On the top floor you can write postcards and send them to any place of the world There is also a restaurant if you want to grab a bite and of course a souvenir shop We will definitely be back again
4262,4,Beautiful views of Seoul from the top of N Seoul Tower Didnt get to take the scenic walk up since we took the cable cart but worth the trip up A lot of restaurants for visitors up here
4263,4,Very beautiful view from the top of the tower You can see the whole of Seoul Theres also this Love Locks platform area where you can put locks and write messages on it
4264,4,Unparalleled views of the city best scene at night Its not cheap but if you get one chance to see Seoul by night head up the tower to do it The view from the top of the mountain itself is great but the tower gets you that bit higher
4265,4,Incredible views of Seoul old and new alike Very affordable ticket cost is well worth it Within the walls of the old city of Seoul but with views of the old quarter the many palaces within the walled city as well as the world renowned Gangnam neighbourhood the Han River and beyond
4266,4,It is certainly worth a few hours to climb the tower an enjoy a huge popcorn portion with a beer The love locks are something to see
4267,4,romantic indeed i love the love locks i love the view i love the uphill walk i love the place
4268,5,If youre going to visit Seoul N Seoul Tower is a must see Its the geological centre of Seoul as well as the highest point so the whole city is laid out before you We went several times during our stay once during sunset and it didnt disappoint What a magical vieweven the bathrooms had a panoramic view  We bought cable car tickets to the top of the mountain and walked down by beautiful stone stairways and walkways The view on the way down is breathtaking and its not a hard walk only 30 minutes so dont miss this great opportunity to see the city from this perspective  Namsan Mountain can get crowded especially during the weekend and at sunset but the view is so worth it Try going during the day as the wait for the cable car can be several hours later in the day or if youre up for it walk to the top There are restaurants and an area where lovers buy locks write their names on them  then lock them to the fence and throw away the key symbolic of their eternal love There are thousands if not tens of thousands of locks Its a little aweinspiring to see so many locks  This was my favourite place to see Seoul and I think it could be yours as well Dont miss it
4269,4,I really liked my experience in N Seoul tower We bought a cable cart tickets and went all the way to the top of the mountain Up there  they have restaurants coffee shops and many snacks places with souvenirs You have to purchase additional ticket if you would like to get to the top of the tower and see Seoul from the top You can purchase a package food with tower visit etc I took a combo package which was the tower visit with 2 diet coke and popcorn Overall nice place and worth the visit especially if you enjoy heights Addtional attraction was the love chains which really looks nice in real life
4270,3,Panoramic view from the tower is worth the trouble of walking up a steep pathway to the tower But it can get very crowded and you may need to wait to find a good spot to click some photos I would recommend this place just for the view it offers If you take the hop onhop off bus you will get 10 discount on the ticket to go up the observation deck
4271,4,Good view of Seoul at the top Boarded the cable car up which was pretty cheap Has to walk around 10 mins from the subway to get here
4272,5,n seoul tower had beautiful view of korea come  sunset till night  eat before trekking up because the food at the top is a bit priceyyou can enjoy a hassle free ride up by taking the cable car but for the adventureous people with very fit legs you can take the stairs up there is good souvenir made from carved wood on top D there is a fee to see the higher parts of the tower but we didnt go because we were cheap xD
4273,5,I went there during my first trip to Seoul and have been there in every visit I like to hike to the tower I am planning to take my fiance for dinner next time in Seoul
4274,5,Namsan Tower is located on a hilltop about an 5km easy hike from well known visiting spots of Insadong and Myongdong Those who have walking difficulty may take cable car to the top Those who would like to hike may either follow the road route or stepped pathway For going up I would suggest the road route which has a synthetic material sidewalk so easy on feet Coming down is a breeze on stepped path There are restaurants and convenience outlets at top No visit to Seoul is complete without enjoying the panoramic views this place offers
4275,5,Enjoy the 360 degrees of SEOUL Take the cable car from the bottom of the park then enjoy the sceneries of seoul from the peak of the Namsan Tower Do go there at night because the there will be a projected light show at the tower itself
4276,5,Last but not least we made our final stop to the most popular attraction in Seoul After a few train rides and then a bus ride of a very steep hill we were at the N Seoul Tower Its not the tower that made this place special though it was their famous locks of love And it was at this moment that I was able to literally lock my love with my partner The view was spectacular I have never seen anything like this in my life
4277,3,We took their cable car to the top and its a great place to overlook Seoul city There are places for the couples to lock their love lock and take photos Previously there was teddy museum but it was closed during our visit A bit disappointed
4278,4,Absolutely love this hike with the kids 4  6 yr olds We started off at the crossroads by Hilton Millennium Hotel and hiked up the stairs The kids enjoyed themselves and the scenary My husband who is not fit at all didnt soo much mind the hike as well Granted the air quality wasnt so great that day but it was good quality time Ive jogged up the never ending road a few times for a good cardio workout but if youre looking for a good leisurely hike to enjoy with the family highly recommend it  Getting to the actual tower is a disappointment Once at the top we couldnt really see much past the US Army base at the foot of the hill because the pollution was bad We werent too happy about the condition of the tourist arealooks like the cleaning crew from the night didnt do anything as trash was all over the place It seemed very dirty in the seated viewing area We were there at 8am so perhaps they only do cleaning later in the morningbut for a place that attracts a lot of tourists highly recommend they have it presentable all the time  Would have given it high rating if it was cleaner So im giving it only very good rating for only the actual hike
4279,3,Great views on a clear day Do not go on a day that is not clear Overall a touristy attraction The historical wall could be seen but no explanation
4280,4,Good view good place have many place for take a photo with couples and friends and family and downstairs have Minimart for every person come to travel here
4281,4,Hiked through the park up to the tower Beautiful park and rewarded by great views at the top of the tower Observation decks outside the tower provide good views too Heritage show held that day outside Music and dancers and swordsman showed in traditional clothing Was a great way to spend an afternoon
4282,5,Having a nice time viewing City of Seoul during night time Since I travelled alone on April 23  28 2015 I preferred to walk with some other tourist talking with them and taking a picture with nice places It takes around 40 minutes walking to reach Seoul Tower from Myeongdong stationStrolling along Namsam Park is more fun and would love to feel weather here Spring time Love Locks is one of the attractions in Seoul Tower Given a chance I would like to visit Seoul Korea again
4283,3,Honestly speaking from afar N Seoul Tower doesnt look very nice hahaha well it still doesnt look pretty when you see it near lol  Hmmm just like any other towers in other countries they look almost the same lol But i guess its a good checklist I think the photo i took when we are outside going off looks nicer  Full review httpwanderersummereecomtravelkoreaseoulnseoultower
4284,3,If you have a tight schedule just skip this place but if you have a lot of free time so you might visit here
4285,5,We started from Myeongdong station Near Shinsegae department store you need to turn to the left and go straight untill you see lift going to tower station lift is free of charge On the tower station we bough ticket for cable car about 8 000 or 9 000 won for roundtrip ticket To get to the tower you need to buy one more ticket but we did not as it is expensive for budget tourists Even there view is beautiful there are a lot of tourists
4286,4,The main attractions are the wonderful landscape of the Han river and City buildings around There I experienced a Cable Bus for the first time it can carry about 25 people at once There are restaurants and the place is very tidy and clean A must visit
4287,4,When in Seoul you definitely should climb the hill and visit the tower to get an impression of the immensity of this city For me it was really breath taking
4288,4,we went there shortly after sunset and it was pretty cool its comparably cheap to go up also the cable car is quite cheap but crowded and the view is cool but useless for a camera as the windows are not very clean still a nice thing must be nice to hike up the mountain
4289,3,we went during winter we walked all the way from the bottom to the top and it was snowing during that time although was tiring but very fun as you can enjoy the view
4290,5,This is an amazing place to visit Another man made wonderment The place is teeming with people and yet its quite The sound barrier is unbelievable
4291,3,Seoul tower Hmm if I had to sum it up from a guys point of view Looks cool at night Girls will probably think its so romantic with all the lovely locks everywhere that look like they are going to take the very rails they are attached to fall off Not really worth going in the day time especially the hot summer days On another note they do have a cable car Not really worth it in my opinion
4292,4,9000won for observation only we went all out and got the popcorn  drinks too It is a great icon which can be seen from almost any point in Seoul we took the cable car up one way and then an easy bus back to the city
4293,4,you can reach by bus or cable car 8000 won for return trip last cable car at 11 PM depart from the tower its better you go there at night
4294,3,It was good view for looking city of Seoul from the top of the tower The view from the bathroom also good  The night city scene was nice too 
4295,4,The place has a beautiful scenery but its too crowded with people We go up here by namsan bus and go back by cable car There is some souvenir store and few eateries Going up will cost 9000won The view from above is good but thats it
4296,4,first of all please prepare your best footwear I suggest running shoes once you reach the entrance of the N Seoul Tower you will be welcomed with almost 40 Degree upward hiking track you HAVE TO walk about 100 meters uphill  once you reach the check point you will see quite spacy area there are shops and cafe in this area in the 2nd level of this area there are lots of love lock hanging on the fence you can take a selfie with nice Seoul city background  Or you can buy an additional entrance ticket for the observatory  for different experience try visit it in day and night  have a nice excursion in N seoul Tower
4297,4,If you like to have a view of Seoul in overall you might like this place Remember to check the weather forecast to avoid rainy day Theres love bridge alike section where people hang their locks on it for wish My advise is bring your own lock because it might be costly to purchase there Go to the observatory tower only your travel budget allow because theres nothing much fun except that you can view the scenery in higher position It is recommended to go there in the evening before the sun goes down then you can view the scenery of Seoul in day and night time However it will be crowded there at that time because many people prefer that moment of time too
4298,5,Ive been to many towers like the Stratosphere in Las Vegas and the Space Needle in Seattle and N Seoul Tower itself is nothing special But I didnt come for the tower I came for the views it provides The tower is situated on top of a mountain in the middle of the city and you can see the entire city and then some depending on visibility of course Be sure to take a bus or the tram I walked up and it took a long time and was a rough climb
4299,4,Its a long way up to the N Seoul Tower and the views are wonderful There are outlooks on both sides of the hill and some lovely landscaping around the area The site is quite commercial with food and souvenir outlets and Love Locks in volumes attached to railings and even made into trees
4300,5,This is one of the Seoul mustdos The first time I visited I ate in the lower level Italian restaurant which was fine This trip I planned to eat at the French inspired Grill restaurant at the top of the tower However the price with inflated holidays pricing taking a simple main close to 200 I decided just to take in the view The view from down below is great and worth the hour long queue for the cable car This is then followed by a 30 minute queue to go up the Namsan tower itself Of course then you have to queue for another 30 minutes to get down the tower and another 45 minutes to get down on the cable car You can beat the queues for the latter by buying only s one way ticket on the many buses which run up and down the mountain The cable car is a brief stuffy cramped ride so I suggest you take a bus both ways
4301,4,You can see in all directions and its best viewed just before the sun goes down so you have a nice view of the sunset
4302,4,Nice view from the top and you can see love locks near the tower They do sell locks if you forget to bring one However the queue to take the cable car is always long even in the weekdays due to holiday season you can also get some snacks if youre hungry there are small eateries nearby
4303,3,It is a good place to visit You can spend some time with your friends and can buy some food and snacks There is an event that takes place related to the cultural dance of Korea There is also a wish point where you can lock your wishes by a lock on wall
4304,4,Although the tower is not the tallest in the world it kinda cheats in terms of height since the tower is on top of a hill  Once you get the N Seoul Tower you have to get down your buscar and walk up a steep hill or you can take a cable car to the top It might be hard for older people but they can do it with some patience  What greets you are vandalized statues and flowers  There are alot of things to do in the tower such us go up the observatory go to the alive museum place a love lock view the pavilion and eat up  To focus more on the tower the lines could get long with the tourists pouring in The elevator only one was working at our time can fit around 1012 people They had this awesome sequence on the top of the elevator that makes you feel like you are going to space  On the top try to take a restroom break as the view there is awesome Their souvenirs are unique although a little pricey at the top
4305,4,Its a nice walk when the weather is cooling Great view of Seoul city from the observation tower Try to avoid weekend as it was very crowded
4306,4,I thought it was a must visit when I was in South Korea so I did At sunset Wanted to catch the sun set on the tower but sadly it was too foggy But it was still beautiful to be able to enjoy the scenery so I will recommend this even though it is a little pricey Go during off peak timings also if you want lesser crowd
4307,4,We got an awesome view of the whole city It was great seeing the city from the tower I highly recommend go during weekday to avoid the long queue
4308,4,By mistake we took the wrong Seoul City Tour Bus but it worked out in the end as we got to take the cable car to the tower the other bus tour goes by road Once at the top the views were just great You can eat and drink at the various eateries but I recommend the ice cream shop We walked around but didnt go up the tower  no need the views are just as spectacular from the various lookouts
4309,5,Recommend finding a bus to the topA lot of locals will walk to the top and my friend and I did this but we really wish we hadnt It definitely made the experience one of our most memorable Once you get to the top the view is excellent It really is beautiful
4310,4,From the 237 m high tower you can enjoy a view of all of Seoul You can take the Namsan Oreumi an inclined escalator that enables visitors to go halfway up the mountain conveniently From there you take the Namsan cable car up to the tower A round trip ticket costs 8500 won Beside the tower one can see Bongoodae beacon signals Everywhere one goes one is bound to see locks Lovers proclaim their ever lasting love for each other by locking their pledges Then there is the Lover chair to snap a photo There are many places to grab refreshments and food Our favourite is Cold Stone where there are many choices of icecream
4311,4,We visited the tower on a Wednesday evening and although it was very busy it always is during evening times the queues to go up on the cable car moved fairly quickly Once we reached the observation deck although there were lots of people there was enough room on the deck for everyone to occupy their own viewing area The views of Seoul at night time are beautiful  Everyone buys a postcard and stands scribbling away before posting into the tiny postbox inside the tower A novelty thing to do
4312,3,We went probably on the wrong day Saturday evening there were far too many people Buying the tickets took over 45 minutes and helpfully the lady at the counter told us that the trip to the tower would take another 90 minutes of waiting And there are not much places to wait About 2 hours later we were called to board the lift to the observation deck on the top floor By this time it had started raining and the view was hindered by the water drops on the glass panes of the observatory So not sure if it was worth the wait
4313,3,Do not try and go here on a Saturday night This is a massive date spot as well as tourist attraction and there is only one cable car to take you up and down The queue for the cable car was over an hour and it was another hour to get up to the top It was a decent view once up there but not worth the wait and hassle Its probably far more enjoyable at any other time
4314,3,i went there during one of the public holiday and theres a lot of people luckily to go up the tower is a jiffy and theres a good hike from parking lot to the base of the tower
4315,4,Not for those who are afraid of heights including me We had to take an elevator upstairs It went incredibly fast At the observatory ring you have a very nice view over the city of Seoul This is best on a clear day but those are scarce
4316,5,I walked up to the tower by accident and being very unfit felt pretty winded as I neared the top The views are completely worth it though on a clear enough day and you could always use the cable car The gift shop has a few cute trinkets in it and there is plenty to eat and drinknot cheap though compared other parts of the city
4317,5,We walked to the N Seoul Tower via the University Station  beginning at the station one can walk through a very tranquil area called Park where the stream meanders under some lovely bridges and plantings The path then goes up on steps above the city where it meets a road where one continues the walk under overhanging trees along a well worn pathroad before splitting up whre we followed the path up to the Seoul Tower track At the top there were many buses disgorging lots of passengers from the city below up to the last part of the walk to the tower itself We were warned about a long queue to go up the tower but after purchasing our tickets the wait was only about 30 minutes the view from the top was fantastic well worth the wait The weather was fairly clear so the whole of Seoul was displayed below us After circumnavigating the observation flkoor taking lots of pictures There was a further wait to descend The Beacons were seen and then the trip down the hill was facilitated by the Cable Car cost of 6000W per person and then followed by the Funicular free to get down to the City level Finishing off with a trip through the Namdaemun Markets to the Sungnyemun Gate Namdaemun Gate All together the day was a very pleasant one in Seoul
4318,4,I opted to hike up Nansan to reach the towers elevator entrance I spent a couple of hours in the observatory since I got there around sunset time It was a great chance to see the city in the daylight and at night There was a beautiful fullmoon rise the night I went too The cable car will probably have a long wait so the bus is most likely a better option if youre pressed for time
4319,5,My wife and I took a trip to N Seoul Tower during a vacation to visit her family last summer We opted to avoid the cable car ride and ended up walking up and down the rather large hill If youre making the trip to visit the tower be sure to bring a lock padlock etc with you They have metal trees set up around the base where you can place a lock with a loved one along with a loving message Views were amazing and on a clear day provides a great opportunity to take pictures of the city
4320,5,Total six of us visited KR and due to the seats limitations we separated into two taxi to go Seoul tower  When me and two of my friends arrived the gate and the taxi driver said cannot drive up yet we can take the bus up to the tower plaza However we waited for a while but we did not see the rest of my friends Lucky we got wifi and whatsapp each other and seems we were being dropped in different place  One taxi took three of us to the cable car  and other taxi sent us to the gate that we need to take bus to go up  We found out there are two ways to go up to Seoul tower plz tell ur taxi driver  if u want go up by bus or cable  PS cable car just take 5mins go up to tower  with a lot of people and expensive I suggest u go to the gate and u can choose to walk up or take bus
4321,5,Evening spend here are stored in memory for ever I had an amazing time here with my friends We went up to in cable car  Then had some wonderful time in museams where we clicked pics like crazy Then some peaceful time at the top of the tower 
4322,5,Seoul city can be viewed in this tower you can reach here by elevator ticket price is 8000won person round trip so enjoy your trip
4323,4,N Tower give a panoramic view of Seoul city skyline Beside the great view there was a good cultural performance outside the N Tower
4324,3,In Seoul our tour group visited the N Seoul Tower which is Koreas transmission tower for television and radio broadcasts It was raining that day and was crowded with holiday makers as it was the peak season in spring We were quite disappointed as we cannot take many photographs of the scenery surrounding the Seoul Tower due to the rain and crowds Our group followed our tour guide who took us to the tower by walking uphill Even though we are fit It was quite difficult to walk uphill especially in the rain and some parts up the hill are steep We took the elevator to the towers Digital Observatory and spend less than an hour there as the place was getting crowded We could see the city of Seoul and Mt Namsam but some parts of the scenery foggy due to the rain Theres a souvenir and snack shop at the observatory deck and my spouse bought a mini N Seoul Tower as a memento of our trip here Prices at the souvenir shop are quite expensive At one part of the tower there are thousands of golden locks Locks of Love which are attached to the fences It seems this is a recent attraction for courting couples to declare their undying affection at this place Nothing special about this tower as we have visited some nicer ones  Taipeis 101 and Shanghais Oriental Pearl Tower
4325,4,We took the cable car up to the tower base The walk up would take a couple of hours and possibly a couple of 1000 steps This is a very popular spot and attracts hundreds of people The view from the top of the tower is breathtaking You really get a chance to see the size of Seoul Immense city We walked down to the city through the gardens Enjoyable happy to be going down and not up
4326,3,the view was just okay so dont expect too much I spend most of my time choosing and writing postcards n send to my friends Plus point You can post ur postcards just in the tower So lovely
4327,4,Going to the tower is a hike but you will enjoy the view The observatory is as expected you will see Seoul from above in 360 degrees Seoul is beautiful I also like the love locks on the deck the place reminds me of Paris A sweet spot for couples in Seoul
4328,4,N seoul tower is located at the Namsan park We walked to the cable car station n go up there U can choose to walk up to the tower but is quite a lot of stairs to climb  if u have time u can go down by walk so that can see around the Namsan Park U have to xtra pay a 9000krw for go up to the tower for a higher view point to see how big this city But v didnt do so We bough a icecream and enjoyed it at the cafe with a huge window which can see the big part of Seoul city n Han River as well And waiting for the sunset Here is no entry fees just to pay the cable car 2000KRW per way per person 3000KRW return per person Very good place to enjoy the sunset moment U can place a love lock here if u want there are some love lock wall full with thousands of lock Good place to take photo as well Best time to come 2 hours before sunset Avoid to come at weekend and friday if you are unluck to meet few groups of tour visit then u may need to q up for an hour for the cable car
4329,1,Very crowded and expensive if you want to take both the cable car and elevator Just hike and then enjoy the view but be prepared for huge crowds Overrated
4330,4,This is definitely a mustsee in Seoul My husband and I walked up to the tower and took the cable car down I would recommend doing the opposite as there are a lot of stairs to climb and it would be easier going down them than climbing up You can pay to go up into the tower and it is worth it to do so The view is incredible
4331,4,We made the reservations for dinner at the N Grill and knew it was going to be very expensive But we were not there for the food which was very good but for the view as the sun set We never felt rushed and was able to enjoy the view as the restaurant rotated during the whole meal Its amazing to see how big the city really is connected with 31 bridges across the Han River
4332,3,We enjoyed the view from the tower as we are interested in urban planning and the view made clear the expanse of Seoul Otherwise its a bit of a tourist trap with pictures taken by staff and effort to sell to you a bit of a hyper tech ride up in the elevator and lots of trinkets and candy for sale at the top It could get expensive if there are a number of you in your party
4333,5,Romantic Place to hang out with all those love locks and the nice view of the metro Great place to dine and spend time with a partner or set of friends 
4334,4,We went up to Namsan Seoul Tower by cable car and walk down by foot Its a beautiful walk and great panoramic view of the city
4335,4,We went on a cloudy day unfortunately but that didnt take away from the excitement of going here Be prepared for the tourist crowd and take the time to put a lock BYO or can purchase on site on the fence as a symbol of eternal love Well worth the quick trip to the top and purchase photo at top for a mere AUS10
4336,3,The tower is a great way to overview the city Its beautiful at night when they light up the tower I would recommend using the cable car to get there if youre not afraid of heights
4337,5,The weather was not so good and it was little cold BUT Seoul Tower is definately worth a visit So much beauty up there the view was great and we stopped by for a nice Long Island Ice tea and some burgers at the restaurants up on the mountain Excellent attraction and well worth the visit
4338,3,Best time to go over is at 700pm as we were quite late to arrived on the top It was on weekdays and is overcrowded Worth to see from the tower which is beautiful view
4339,5,Second trip to Namsan First took the cable car and loved it Second climbed the mountain Dont recommend it if you have trouble breathing Because the breathtaking views will take anything else you need to make it to the top Fun things to do as shown by a couple of my pics Italian restaurant was delicious and I felt the price was reasonable considering the atmosphere and relaxing view
4340,2,We didnt go up as it was very expensive and there was a set of stairs up a hill pretty much next to the tower which offered a very similar view for free I would also say it is not the worth the trip to see just the tower there are a few parks and recreational rooms karoake pc rooms bars etc  nearby to make going to this part of Seoul worth it
4342,1,We took the cable car to reach the Tower We took beautiful pictures and watched the sun to fade There were a lot of lovers or tourists chose to walk up or down the hill in order to see the beautiful view alongside
4343,4,We went up on hazy morning in March and it cleared to see a great view of Seoul Its a bit cheesy with touristy things But its worth a visit Take the cable car up and walk down close to the Seoul wall
4345,5,Prenez un peu de hauteur pour apprecier letendue de la capitale du pays du matin calme Prenez tout dabord le telepherique qui vous amene au pied de la tour Il faut compter 10 000 W pour la tour et 8 500 W pour le telepherique
4346,3,If you want to see Seoul  this is a great place to go in order to get an overview  The price is ok and the trip up is efficient  If in Seoul  a must see
4347,4,Symbol of Seoul Must see I went for the sunset and thats worth it Beautiful view even if you dont go up the tower
4348,4,Wir sind in der Dammerung zum Tower hoch gelaufen und hatten dann im dunkeln eine wunderschone Aussicht uber die Lichter von Seoul Es lohnt sich auf jeden Fall auch wenn der Eintritt bei 10000 Won liegt Leider war es sehr voll und es gab eine Warteschlange bevor man in den Aufzug nach oben konnte ebenso musste man einige Zeit warten um einen Aufzug wieder nach unten zu bekommen
4349,5,Short of taking off in a helicopter No better way to see all of Seoul A must do for here for just one day and want to knock out a couple things
4350,4,Lot of people want to get to the top But its a nice view Went up not using cable car no problem to get to the top
4351,2,i took the cable car only to realize I had to pay more for the tower It was a rainy day so I decided not to go up Kind of sucks to have to pay again  The locks are cool although I think they must move them around bc almost everything was from 2015
4352,4,The N Seoul Tower and the surrondings is a beautiful place From the base of Namsan it is recommended you take the cable car up as it is a long hike to the tower We went up in the evening you can get lots of sunset shots and the night view of the tower  Once the cable reaches its destination youll be able to see the insane amount of love locks DO bring your own lock if you want to do that the locks they sell on site are very pricey  Proceeding from the love locks area youll reach the actual Namsan Tower Get tickets at the outside counter before going up Interesting that they sell popcorn  drinks  observatory packages though you can just go for the observatory tickets if you dont want the extras 9000 won for a single ticket IIRC  The view from the top is quite impressive Each glass pane features the name of major cities in its general direction Youll be able to send a postcard back to your country from the gift shop Also lots of souvenirs Expensive stuff though  Overall nice place to visit
4353,4,The views up there are nice Plus the windows are marked with the distances from most of the major capitals in the World 360 degree fun  BTW there is a place where couples place their locks on the bridge BRING YOUR OWN LOK
4354,5,I went up twice and in both occasions I took public bus Number 3 from Itaewon subway MRT Another way to go up there is by taking cable car but it is a more pricey option Another way to go up is to walk uphill The sceneries are amazing  Around sunset time is the best time to go
4355,5,Nice cable car ride and interesting lift ceiling video Observation deck was crowded but one can still view the whole of Seoul city Very romantic park at the top of the cable car station
4356,5,I liked the visiting of the Tower very much The way to it was spectacular You can walk and relax Once there you can enjoy the fontain which breezes you with almost invisible drops  lovely feeling Than there is good choice of restaurants or bistros to eat The tower itself is very difficult to observe if you are staying just underneath And of course the funicular experience added a very nice atmosphere to that relaxed visit
4357,5,Lucky weather was cooperating during the drive to the top My Tour Guide made sure it would be very easy for us to see the complete panoramic view of the N Tower It was absolutely amazing
4358,4,To start with its on the highest hill in Seoul Then you take an elevator to the top The view is marvelous but wait for a clear day Thats easy when you can see the tower clearly from above the view down should be clear as well Acoustics in the observatory on top are just horrible awfully noisy A good thing we were there on a quiet day Around the tower interesting leftovers from the ancient Seoul defense works also well worth a visit
4359,4,This tower gives you a great view of the entire city Try to go on a good air quality day though when we went our guide said it was a good day but it still looked fairly hazy Its scary to think that North Korea is so close and just beyond a mountain range that you have a good view of here We only went to the ground level of the tower and we could see everything just fine You can bring a lock if you like to put on one of the walls to symbolize your love for your partner There are good restrooms here at this facility as well so a good place to visit and have a restroom break
4360,4,Breathtaking view of seoul from the towerI and my wife opted to hike up to the tower instead of taking the busBeautiful park on the way up with a scenic viewDont forget to bring along padlocks to lock at the padlocks of loveA must go place in seoulEnjoy
4361,3,During most of my trip to Korea the sky was very smoggy or overcast looking So we didnt really have much choice of when we went So all I can say is that on an overcast kinda day I would just walk around the grounds and maybe do all the FREE things Going all the way up to the top was nice but we didnt really get a good view After we got back down we realized there was a place for us to walk up to the deck with all the love locks and that provided the same kinda of view from up top considering the condition of the sky So we kinda regretted even paying
4362,5,The Namsan tower is a must see It is the trademark of Seoul It is one of the Great Towers that is around the world with amazing views Given that it isnt foggy from the yellow dust or rain I personally have hiked up the many steps that are there along the side It is quite a workout If you prefer you can take a public transportation bus a cable cart or a taxi Once you get up to the top there is a love lock wall You have the option of purchasing a ticket and going all the way up the tower to see 360 degree views in Seoul It is definitely worth stopping by
4363,4,Great view of the city nice place to eat and relax Was there in the end of March 2015 it was chilly but worth the visit
4364,4,Going to the tallest point in any city helps give you are great perspective and the Seoul Tower is no exception But there is a lot of walking and climbing up steps which makes ot less than friendly with those that may have mobility challenges
4365,4,Lovely views the kids loved running around at base of tower food prices reasonable and the souvenir shops too
4366,4,Got lost trying to get here the first time by bus and gave up but found it much easier the second time on the metro The walk up is nice and the views are great if its a clear day but no point with smoghaze Worth a trip once to see it
4367,3,Walked to the top but might want to take the cable car the view is nice and could be great but so much haze distance you can see if very limited I didnt bother going up the tower because of this same view from there as the base given this Several eateries at the base and gift shop As a couple you can leave a love lock to in numerous areas as part of eternal love  a romantic thing to do Would rate attraction much high had their not been so much smog At night might be better But if at day pick a clear day or windy so it blows the smog off
4368,4,I visited here last Christmas Dont bring your car Super annoying parking lot Here is so crowded But when you get your seat or space then much better
4369,5,there is an alive museum inside the tower where you can take silly crazy pictures My 10 year old loved it The park is beautiful If you or someone you are traveling with have limited mobility I suggest you take the hop on hop off bus it will drop you right on top you wont have to walk up the hill for too long or take the cable car
4370,5,Great place to see Seoul from top of the tower There are few nice souvenirs shops and places to eat as well I even enjoyed hike up the hill on sunny day Worth visiting for sure
4371,5,This place is located uphill But it was worth the trip The sunset was spectacular One of its own If you are on a honeymoon to seoul include this place as part of your itinery Buy a lock and lock your love at the places provided
4372,5,This is a beautiful symbol of one of my favorite cities The walk is painful to the top but when you see the city from that high up   Lovely The sky car that takes you to the train is a great experience too 
4373,4,amazing view of the city Make sure to visit it at night to see the twinkling lights of the city i love the door lock trees or whatever 
4374,4,Ive been here twice once at night and once during the day Both give different vibes At night you have the twinkling lights if the city and in the day you have a better view of the city Although if you go during a cloudy day views are hazy Con would be that they didnt not have clean windows so you have a foggy and dirty windows so unclear views
4375,4,Great 360 degree Seoul view from the Tower Worth a visit especially if you hike updown Has quite a few places to eat  drink as well Evening visit is definitely amazing
4376,5,visited the tower at dusk last spring it was a beautiful sight from the moment we stepped into the gondola which brings you up to Namsan afterwards wood staircases bring you up to the ticket booth shops and famous lovers lock area where thousands of couples put on locks with their initials a pretty romantic sight The tower gets lid up at night its gorgeous and looking unto the nightlife of Seoul you sink into the beautiful city of Seoul
4377,4,Ive never seen so many locks in one place  intertwined with initials and messages from couples This is what you will see once youve come down from N Seoul Tower
4378,2,High on a hill with wonderful views of Seoul Unfortunately BUS LOADS of tourists also think the same thing Not sure you can tour Seoul without including this on your tour Okay vistas Not worth the hassle of the crowds
4379,4,The view from the tower is amazing but you better be ready to climb a very steep hill to get to the tower once youre up there and go inside you go up the elevator which is very fun by the way and up in the tower they have a candy store and souvenir store and of course the amazing view from the glass all around the tower kind of like the Empire State building in NYC but indoors
4380,5,The view was absolutely stunning When I was up there i can see the whole city and it was WOW i think the negative side of this is that we have to walk up a long ramp before you can reach the destination but it was all worth it
4381,4,This is an observation tower located on Namsan Mountain in central Seoul South Korea At 236m it marks the highest point in Seoul One can ride the Namsan cable car up the Mt Namsan to walk to the tower Best time to see is during night time when the tower lights up
4382,4,Nice photo opps You can have your picture taken inside and outside theres a couple of restaurants and souvenirshops I liked it its no Tokyo sky tree but its a nice place where you can spend an hour
4383,2,The glass up in the Tower was extremely dirty If youre heading up there to take pictures stop at the hill dont pay that amount of money to go up the tower
4384,4,Before Seoul Tower I like to walk for a while in Namsan Park and feel the nice view  clean air When you arrive you could wander in the lobby of the tower There are some souvenir shops there and ithey have great things to take home with When you are in the tower try to share the view with someone you like
4385,4,The N Seoul Tower was an attraction that was recommended by a friend On a clear day it gives you a great view of the city It is not the tallest tower but it is on a hill The view at the top was great We could see all of Seoul and we were able to spot landmarks like the large palaces The entry fee wasnt too bad and it was definitely worth it
4386,4,you dont even need to go up the tower to enjoy it the views are good and theres more to see and do than i expected theres a fence and other stuff with a bunch of locks on it so bring a lock if you want to leave a little piece of you behind you can buy locks up there too though
4387,4,Everywhere I go I see couples everywhere including the place on the street in a movie theartre or even under the long pathway under the bridge  The Tower it self is quite beautiful yet there are much more romance per se which you ought to find out about the Locks hanging on the rails Couple used to lock the lock together then throwing the locks down the deck immortalizing the love relationship for eternity long while ago this activity was a famous attraction Now I think its prohibited  Inside the tower there are some Museums you can totally check it out
4388,3,The weather was cloudy when we took a cable car ride up to the tower The views were not as beautiful as I expected We got there at the wrong time If you want to enjoy the most beautiful views of Seoul you should go to the tower when the sky is clear There was a layer of dust on the glass The view would have been much better if the glass was sparkling clean  Would you like to leave a love message there You could firstly buy a love message tile write you message on it and stick it on the love message block Some visitors even stuck photos on the tiles There are clear instructions which teach you how to do it
4389,5,If you take a subway to myeondong station seoul tower is within walking distance about 20 minutes uphill if you dont like walking then hail a cab and they will be glad to bring you Take the cable car and really spend some time up there rather than just for the sake of putting locks Theres a lot to see At night the scenery is very beautiful A great location not to miss
4390,4,Visit it during the night after a short walk from hongdae Took the cable car up to the tower and spend some hours inside the tower and love lock area for some nice night view  Good to go after dinner as a final visit place for the day
4391,4,Nice half day out Take the cable car up and then go up the tower for the best possible view of the city and beyond on a clear day then walk down the steps back down through the park to see some immense impressive statues and scenery
4392,5,Only bought the ride up to the observation deck So many choices to buy packages for lunchdinner to be included with observation deck tickets Ponder over what suits you before buying the correct package So many eateries here Restrooms on top provide great views too Easy access by public buses Didnt use the cable car
4393,5,It was very nice to see the city at night from the high level of the tower The city looked amazing with many colors
4394,4,Use the cable car or natural gas bus to reach the top of the mountain I went there several times but really good place to go if you have a change to visit to Seoul I went many towers Seattle Needle space Eiffel tower in Paris Toronto toweralso Tokyo Tower in Japan Star tower Shanghai in China Yes Seoul tower is not fancy but really attractive place to go and look Recommend the spring time together with your family or friend You can try inexpensive restaurant near the cable car station  Fried Pork rice around 67 No need the tips in Korea We did lunch at the top of the Seoul tower but I forget the name of restaurant Buffet restaurant around 20person Enjoy trip
4395,4,Bring your walking shoes and hike up the steps next to the old fortress wall area on the way up you can stop and take some photos at an overlook the finish with the North Seoul Tower lots of people most take the bus or cable cars I will stop back again just for the hike up and back down plan to spend the day lots to see if you walk through the town first
4396,5,Took the cable car up to the N Seoul Tower  I recommend that you buy the deal where you get a free popcorn to munch while you admire the view from the top  The view is fantastic and you can see all of Seoul on a clear day  The day that we were there there was traditional music being played at the base of the tower
4397,4,Situated on Top of Namsan hill; Can walk from Hohyeon station which closer to cable car station than Myeongdong A ride on top costs 8500 KRW or 8 USD Dollar; No seat in the riding cube have to stand crammed til the end of route Long queue 60 minutes wait for ticket bought the ride took about 15 minutes then continued further walking steps 40 or 50 staircase to the square lawn at top  There are master key on sell request for Lovers who do believe a bonding locked activities will make their love last long forever An iron master key locked christmas pine tree where wooden broken chair areaat front for photo shoot Colorful laser light show bathe the tower at night; A panorama Seoul city view when sunset Foods  Restaurant and Teddy Bears museum plus souvenir service here also
4398,4,i stayed at the Hilton at the bottom of the hill from the tower and decided to walk through the park and up to the tower This took about an hour and was some great exercise amid a typical business trip of sitting and more sitting The views of the city were great during the walk but nothing compared to the views from the tower itself You can get food and drinks at the top and there are some interesting vendors in that area Even if you dont pay to go up the tower the walk tot he top is nice and affords some great views;
4399,4,I did not take the cable car as long queues during long public holidays However there is a cool  box lift to take you up and have nice view over city And the local food shop serves good local beef soup
4400,4,Best part of this place at evening times they do laser lights on tower Looks awesome view  laser show at nights Cable car is one good thing Lift to the top of the tower with some food and shopping in middle
4401,4,A nice walk up to the Tower to enjoy park like setting beautiful views on the walk up After a quick ride to the top you can see all of Seoul
4402,5,Its a nice climb but we enjoyed our time together and the view of the city was great for us well worth the visit
4403,3,You have to go to the tower to look down on the city I did it twice Once during the day  the other a night During the day they had a group of men dressed in old military traditional clothes demonstrating different fighting weapons
4404,5,Seoul Tower is THE major landmark in Seoul You can see it from very far and at night with the lights it stands out But the best thing about Seoul Tower isnt the tower itself its Namsan Park There are many many paved walking paths and even more side trails You can walk for hours and hours and in the springtime there are many flowers And in the fall you have the Cherry Blossoms As for the tower itself nice few from the top if you can see  Pollutionhaze can be very thick and will ruin the view There is also a restuarant but youll need reservations The wife and I walk the park all the time    its a repreve from the hustle and bustle of Seoul
4405,4,I had half a day off on a recent business trip and went up the hill to the Seoul Tower I rode the gondola up but it was a gorgeous sunny day so walked back down I and two colleagues met at the base of the tower and paid to ride the elevator up and have lunch It was a little expensive but worth it for a delicious lunch and a fantastic view
4406,4,To be honest the climb isnt so special I just prefer to walk up things if the options there but its not difficult Views from the top are great but check the weather in advance  if its rainy foggy smoggy etc you wont see much
4407,3,Although the view from the top of the tower is outstanding I quite dislike the merchandising the stores the accessibility of the spotThere is a teddy bear museum for instance which is totally unrelated and not worth a penny If you are just coming fot the view it s perfect but you will be disappointed if you wanted a cool hangout
4408,5,A very famous tower with amazing view the queue was too long we waited for almost an hour or so  But its worth it you can show your love to others by buying your lock and wrting your msg then keep it at the top of the tower
4409,5,This is one of the must see attractions in Seoul I went in the afternoon but despite being a smoggy day the views were spectacular I decided to take a taxi to the CBD but walked to the tower being an avid walker and toured much of the surrounding area which also had some other fascinating attractions Price was what you would expect and food was reasonable as well I had a coffee at the top while taking in the great views of the city
4410,4,Great view but be prepared for alot of other people going up and leave yourself plenty of time to get back before the gondola closes to get back as its packed most nights  Great spot to stop and enjoy a few beers with friends
4411,5,This is a really great place to visit and I only wish we had allowed more time We went by night and it was very cold but thats no surprise given it was January We caught the gondola up and had little wait time and perhaps 15 minutes wait on the way down The photo opportunities when you get to the tower are incredible and there are also padlock walls as youd have seen around the world You can enjoy restaurants here or go even further up within the tower for greater views Our small children didnt want us to keep them out any longer so we enjoyed our time up there and perhaps if i could do this again id go up in the afternoon instead of the evening after dinner so that we could have stayed longer and enjoyed the sun setting from the top
4412,4,To save yourself some troublesThere are buses that travel up to Seoul Tower at Myeongdong Station I made the mistake of taking a taxi and I am pretty sure that cabby screwed me over because I was a foreigner Lets just say on our departure I had some choice words with the other cabbies that tried to charge a set fee of \20000 but we found out that Myeongdong Station was literally down the hill from the Lift Cars by walking so duckies saved  I suggest going at night because the view of Seoul is breath taking It is amazing to see how much Seoul changed from my time as a kid in the 80s until now I wish the Army would allow me to stay longer but unfortunately that is not an option  Check out the Bear Museum inside I know the kids will get a kick out of it and dont forget the skydeck Been here once in the day and night so the block has been checked off
4413,4,The tower gave a great view of Seoul the Italian restaurant was reasonably priced and very good with good service We would have liked to eat at the top of the tower and enjoy the view but the French restaurant at the top was pretty expensive You can do put a love lock on the fence at the base if you like We took the bus ride up and the gondola down The gondola ride is VERY short and probably not worth the extra money
4414,3,The tower itself doesnt give me breathtaking view its quite normal view from the top but still good for you who like to take a seat and take a high view over the city What tick my curiosity is the Love Lock below the tower many couple comes here to buy a lock write your wish with your couple and lock it together Its like a lucky charm and simbolic of eternal love Simlar to the one in the bridge where we can find in some of the places in the world Well not much to say but still its a great place to go when you have some spare time with your couple or family D
4415,3,Although the stairs represent a strenuious exercise for a cubicle dweller Im 65 and managed the climb with one rest period The good news is that for 6300 won you can take the cable car to the top almost  If you choose the stairs athletic or hiking shoes are suggested although I did see some Asian women climbing the stairs with 4 inch heels I also saw one man in his upper 80s making the climb  The pollution in Seoul isnt publicised as much as some other Asian venues but is worth considering although some great views are available a bad pollution day makes short range photography manageable but city view shots may be entirely obscured  There are multiple restaurants grab joints beverages trinket shops and a view from the top of the tower available but it was too polluted when I visited to merit going up the tower and there are 360 degree views available from the plaza at the base of the tower
4416,4,Theres a jolly steep hill here And there are lots of love padlocks The tower is okay the view is not so bad and it really is rather thrilling to be so high up and sit on the ledge But too many tourists in the evening so best to come when it has just opened
4417,4,Easy to go by Taxi or if you want to walk A little steep hill to climb from MyeongDong Subway exit  If you are travelling with elders or seniors better just get a cab up the hill to the Cable Car place where you will pay a return trip for the cable car to bring you up to NSeoul Tower  Great view on top of it make sure the weather is clear Yes its very cold during winter  You can have your Lunch or Dinner there theres a Burger bar and some casual food court Icecream place and an official Teddy Bear korea store  The ticketing is easy very straight forward and so far their english is ok and no problem buying tickets  Once arrived to N Seoul Tower up the hill by cable car Takes 5min or so very quick and easy Like in KDrama lots of Padlocks with love messages which you wouldnt spend much time if youre solo or with your family Vending machines for drinks and hot drinks  Theres an Alive Museum which you can when you go to Insadong or Insadongs Samzigil  To conclude It wont cost too much to pay a visit to this unique and must go place yes it will not take you too long to come back down since theres nothing much to do unless you plan to have a good date there then its perfect chill and nice atmosphere  If Im not mistaken the opening hours are till late 11pm
4418,3,Nice view but overcrowded on weekend nights Spet 2 hours queuing to get into cable car station  Remember to place locks on the fence in seoul tower  Check out my pictures
4419,3,Just another one of those tall towers where you can go up and see the view Unfortunately was a cloudy day so nothing much to see No difference than Taipei101 Empire State Building or Eiffel Tower when youre up there but lack the class and status to be on the same level as the abovementioned though
4420,3,Landmark of seoul You will see a lot of couple go up there for dating It get a bit crowded especially over weekend
4421,3,I always like going to see a 360 degree view of a city Next time I would bring my binoculars You can walk or take the skyway up to the tower It is a round trip ticket
4422,4,The tower is set in the centre of Seoul and it offers 360 degree views of this giant city Vert nice except that the air was not as clear as in Australia or New Zealand which affected visibility but still amazing to see the city spread out like that Would also be lovely at night There is a really cool art exhibition at the bottom level too which should not be missed 3D art entry is covered by the same ticket as to go up the tower About 15000 won per adult
4423,3,If you have some free time left at night you may want to consider visiting this place It offers great night view of the city Not as gorgeous as I had expected but good enough to kill some time They also have many restaurants at the foot of the tower
4424,4,This tower is a trademark of seoul However the tower seems small  but since it is on the mountain it looks big Compared to effiel tower in paris and tokyo tower this is far from the league But however the place is good and there is an observateory restaurants park and museums Plus the light show over the tower is really good to see Over all a kind of must visit place if came to south korea
4425,5,A beautiful view of the city will welcome you up on the N Seoul Tower Try the Cable Car when going up or down the tower Also visit at night to see the beautiful lights of Seoul
4426,4,We didnt went up to the tower as we felt that the view on ground level was already great There are a few restaurantscafes located there least to say souvenir shops too There is also a tentage that offers free hanbok costume for photography We visited it during the day night view would be awesome too
4427,5,This is a fantastic place to experience the best views of Seoul I would suggest going on a weekday as I was there on a Saturday and it was absolutely packed full of people A wonderful cultural performance was going on in the courtyard area which was fantastic to watch There are food and souvenir venues in and around the tower although it was a little difficult to find the restrooms I reached the tower via the cable car which was enjoyable but the line was extremely long Overall Id highly recommend a visit to the N Seoul Tower
4428,4,Check weather conditions before going take a lock if your with your partner The walk is most pleasant but a cable cart is availibke
4429,5,Great place for tourists easy to come by taxi great walk and great restaurant at the top with affordable lunch with great taste Cherry blossom in April is amazing Not too crowded during the day You will need at least 3 hours to enjoy your time up there The cable is slow but provides good experience
4430,4,The climb is a little steep so be prepared for that You can get the full tower view from the base where the tour bus would be parked At the entrance you will be photographed and you can collect the same at the top so be prepared beforehand While on top you can visit your nation with the capital that would be giving you the distance to your country from the tower and the direction You can take snaps pointing out to your nation as a proof of your visit The night view is awesome and you need to be prepared with a good flash on your camera to get a great snap
4431,5,Getting here is so effortless for us ive been here few days ago with my colleagues since its near our guesthouse where we stayed namsan area Best time to go here would be at night be here at 56pm since evening schedule is the peak time for the visitors  NOTE we only availed of the cable car transportation and observation within the plaza only we were not able to experience getting into the tower for the wishing pond observatory and restaurants  How to get here We took the cable car route so this is the only thing i can share with you in detail Though you have the option of taking a bus tour or you can walk yes taking the trail heading up the hill or the socalled inclined elevator not so familiar with this   first coming from wherever you are in seoul best stop would be at myeongdong station take exit 3 and walk towards pacific hotel  take the road to your right and walk straight and head towards the top since namsan area is a hill place  take the stairs to your right going to the cable car terminal if you want to the easy way of getting to the top of the mountain for the tower  expect a long queue but it is fast moving so dont worry  you have the option of buying singlejourney or round turn ticket for ticket prices visit httpwwwnseoultowercokrengvisittraffic2asp  for more info for tourist info regarding this attraction visit httpenglishvisitkoreaorkrenuSISI_EN_3_1_1_1jspcid264550
4432,5,So many couples come here  dont forget to bring a padlock to write your love story and them locked it at fence under the tower  you also can but store at the tower but its little expensive I feel this place will Be so romantic if you go with your Love  we went with 5 other friends and we purchased returns cable car tickets Got to queue for the last cable car down the hill its worth the visit as view is fantastic and and on the way to N tower  A pleasant way to spend a few hour 
4433,3,We had to wait over an hour just to get onto the cable car to go to the base of the mountain and pay for that Then you have to wait again and pay again to go up to the top of the tower The views were great but very crowded Not enough places for food and nowhere near enough seats
4434,3,So many locks on the fences on the hill Pleasant walk up the hill Good for exercise Great view Many people on the hill
4435,3,I think this place be romantic if you go with your love So many couples come here Dont forget to bring a padlock to write your love story and then locked it at fence under the tower If you forget bring the padlock you can buy in the store at the tower But the price a little bit expensive i think And say no to vandalism I found many vandalism here and i dont like that
4436,3,I had the great idea to go to the tower to see sun set and then the sparkling views of the city I arrived in daylight the queue was long they then changed staff in which everything came to a holt So after I brought my ticket 8500 won return for the cable car I thought great here we go but no as I started walking to the 2nd Floor I was halted by a room full of queueing people and again on the 3rd Floor It took from joining the queue to boarding the cable car 1 hour 5 mins and by this time the sunset was nearly over The cable car holds approx 30 people and on arrival at the top you then have to walk up many steps to the tower its self The queue for the ticket here was very quick only 9000 won and then I proceeded quite quickly to the observation deck By this time night fall had arrived and I had amazing views over the city but I had missed the sunset I so wanted to capture I was advised that as it was a Saturday it was always very busy so bad timing on my part but the sky had been so clear and turned out to be the best time Dont be put off by going you should visit but give yourself plenty of time to get to the top and there is plenty of facilities there if you have to wait The views are really worth it and its once of those must dos
4437,3,Nice enough views but not worth queuing too long for Nice touch to have the compass direction on the walls Went around 7pm in winter so got there without too much waitthere were signs for where the 70 min wait point was for the cable car If you are able have time probably worth walking up
4438,4,excellent place to start Seoul Tour u r right on top grand panorama view of the city open air guard drama at mock castle gatea place where people can write and lock their messages for their belovedsee thousands of them
4439,3,Its definitely an awesome place for couples and families to look down all the way downtown of Seoul Unfortunately these days its packed with group tourists Maybe too good to be peaceful
4440,5,Went with 2 friends We purchased returned cable car tickets We reached in the evening around 7pm  left around 930pm  got to queue for the last cable car down the hill It is worth the visit as the view is fantastic  on the way to the N Tower there are plenty of locks at the side of the walls Along the way one could see a few tall Christmas trees at a closer look these trees are not real trees but thousands of locks made into the shape of trees  Took lots of photos here By the way there are also lockers near the ticket counter
4441,3,I visited here in the early fall of 2014 the mountains are absolutely stunning and the view is great Being that high in the air was an incredible experience I sent a postcard from the tower which was really fun However it was a little too crowded and felt like a typical tourist place which isnt my style Other people might enjoy it I am glad I visited at least once though
4442,5,free trial hanbok palace guard performance around 11 or 12 in the moring taking picture with palace guard price to N Tower is valuable and i forget the price can use cable car to go to N Tower
4443,5,I recently went to Seoul Tower in the evening Right outside by the ticket counter there is this cool Gazebo looking structure and its huge You can take great pictures and videos On the tower itself they have projected some cool stuff I will let you see it yourself I rather not ruin the surprise for you all But overall I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoy photography or something with familyfriends or on a date It has 360 degree views from the top and worth every penny 7000 Won  US 650
4444,4,we walked up the hill rather that taking the cablecar; partially to do with being massively hungover and having the fear and because the various views whilst climbing up being spectacular once at the top there is a lively amount of people on the plateau we didnt actually go up into the tower so this review is not designed for that but to see it from the outside at dusk was still a special occasion
4445,4,Its worthwhile to make the walk up the hill to the tower as it gives you perspective over the city on the way up The tower itself is well set up for tourists and all around the windows are the km to your favourite city all over the world which is interesting You can enjoy a hot chocolate and take in the view over Seoul On the way walking down you can buy your padlock and add it to the many already affixed A pleasant way to spend a few hours
4446,4,I took a bus opposite myeongdong all the way up till the N Seoul Tower instead of the cable car to save cost and also pointless to the city view twice when you are going up the Tower Strongly suggest to go in the night to look at the night view but be prepared if there is a queue to go up the tower if there are too many tourists Because there is a fixed size of people allowed to be on top of the tower at any point of time so you have to wait for people to leave the tower before the next batch of people is being sent up Recommend you to start making your way there before sunset  to avoid the crowd
4447,4,The view from atop was no question of scenic but it the usual high tower that every main city has however they have little gift shops at the top and in my opinion better But at the bottom there are cafes teddy bear shop and so on Additionally there are great little photoops around Quite the walk uphill however its worth the little exercise
4448,3,The architecture has one archetype The exterior is the same for each building The interior  no interior I would spent going walking around the most vital city of Seoul instead
4449,5,Had an afternoon while there on business and walked up from Itaewon Its clear that its up on a pretty good hill and there are nicely laid out stairwayswalkways to take you all the way to the top You just dont realize how far you are about to walk Lots of activity here on the weekends; when I was there on a Sunday afternoon there were many different native dance groups demonstrating their talents Paid for the visit to the top of the tower; it was worth it On the various levels they have info on what you see in the area as well as how far international landmarks are in different directions Need to do this again at night to enjoy that view RECOMMENDED
4450,5,Just like in the movies And the atmosphere was nice as well The locks were such an interesting sight and like in the kdramas
4451,4,The hill with the tower overlooks the city and has a marvelous view of its own There is no need to pay the fee and go to observation deck and the top of the tower itself unless you are just dying to go up higher The view is great from the hill at the base of the tower that overlooks the Seoul area Dress warm in the winter months especially if you decide to skip the electric bus and walk up the hill about a mile  it is quite chilly and windy on top of the hill There are souvenir shops and cafes for a quick bite on top of the hill  also the area houses the locks of love fence if you want to add your own expression of togetherness with your significant other
4452,4,Breathtaking view of Seoul City Gets crowded towards evening time Padlocks are available with a fee Not as romantic as Paris though but you can indeed lock your promises with each other there Ob deck is the usual observatory Must pay twice cable car and the observation deck should you wish to go up
4453,4,Once youve gone up on other countriescities towers climbing up towers gets a little old Although I must say location is key Since Seoul Tower is on a hill it gives viewers on the deck a good view all around Seoul There is a steep climbwalk to the base of the tower coming from the vehicle drop point so it may be tiring for small children or the elderly A few coffee shops and a souvenir store are in the area as well as a version of their own lovelock bridge where loved ones can leave a padlock as an expression of their love
4454,3,As any other observation deck you can see plenty of lights at night If you have experience of this in other cities I suggest to skip it If not always is nice to see the world below you Of course every delight comes with a price its crowed and not cheap
4455,4,You can take many nice pictures of the city when you are there My wife and I went there in the evening and the view was great so we took many pictures It is a good place to go during night time but we had to wait for an hour to get on the tram in order to get to the tower We took the bus to get back to the town area after the visit I would rather go there by bus because I dont want to wait for an hour to get on the tram
4456,4,You had to walk uphill for about 15 minutes from Myeongdong to the cable car station to take the cable car to the bottom of N Seoul Tower We found no necessity to pay extra to go up the tower as the scenery from the bottom was already nice enough Quite crowded with tourists though and there are souvenir shops and eateries for you to while your time away
4457,5,The highest in Seoul where we can see Seoul from the top Quite crowded The souvenir shop at the top I love the cute stuff They have postal box and postcard with stamps if you want to send postcard Better buy on the top store because it provides stamps
4458,3,The construction and decoration are quite modern You can find different famous brands or restaurant It is a good place for luxury shopping Because of the long queue for visiting the observatory I highly recommend you to prepare much time for waiting
4459,5,we come here on december is so cold and many people too need wait a long time but everything is okay the views is nice and pretty
4460,4,a nice place to visit you can actually enjoy the road leading to the tower also good nature and roads and pavements in good condition
4461,5,Can be costly if you take the cable car both ways But in winter you may need to However if it is not too cold you can buy one way and walk down slowly Read Jill G Review on how to save costs If your kids wanna see the Alive museum you can buy a package with the tower
4462,4,It only takes about 15 Minutes from where we stayed The queuing was terrible but once you reached the top  its awesome A perfect view of Seoul City from the tower Nice place and scenery Ideal time to spend there is about 23 hours There are a few coffee stop outlets Nice place to take a rest and enjoy the Seoul City scenery
4463,5,I love Namsan Tower The view over the city was spectacular and beautiful The locks are amazing around the mountain rails It is spectacular to see There are many great photo opportunities and things to do I love NamSan
4464,5,If you have time and energy you should walk from bottom Best season to visit is Octoberearly November autumn All the sleeves turn into different colors
4465,5,N Seoul Tower is cool for various reasons the location in a big park the views from high up in the tower for looking at or attaching of love locks to watch the daily folklore shows  Touristy yes but not in a bad way I went there twice during my stay in Seoul  You can read my reviews here httpcurlytravellercom201402seoultowerhtml and here httpcurlytravellercom201410visitingnseoultowerhtml
4466,5,Going to Seoul and not visiting the N Seoul Tower is like going to Paris and not visiting the Eiffel Tower You can reach the tower by cable ride north or walking  bus south Prices are ok within what is expected for a tourist attraction Restaurants are a bit overpriced but worth the visit considering the view
4467,4,Well first of I am a bit biased I love this place sometimes and sometimes it sucks I would recommend Spring or early Summer If you can find that perfect evening its great  Dont take the cable car waste of money and takes forever to stand in the line Dont go up into the tower itself either that will cost you more money and it is not really worth it  My advice is that you either take the bus or even better hike up the mountain Hiking to Namsan Tower from Myeongdong takes from 2550 minutes depending on your speed Walking can be very nice surrounded by trees Once you reach the top of the mountain you have a great view over the cityscape  If you buy food or snacks at the tower it is a bit expensive as well The souvenir shop is quite good but also that a bit over priced
4468,4,We went up with the cable car and up in the tower as well It was a nice day so we saw all Seoul from the tower I guess it would not be the same on a cloudy day so prepare this attraction on a good sunny day After the tower we enter the Alive Museum and this was what my kids enjoyed most of this attraction You can buy a package ticket with both visit the tower and the museum and save some money
4469,2,Unlike some of the reviews here we did not encounter any crowd at all Maybe it was coz it was a freezing 5 deg that day Or that a harsh wind was blowing Or that it was 11am in the morning Whatever the reason there was hardly anyone waiting for the cable car or the Namsan elevator However the cable car is overpriced the entrance to the top of the tower is overpriced the shops are overpriced Nothing very interesting about this place Theres this whole lot of weird locks around the area and they sell cheapo locks at such horrendous prices I wonder why in the world would anyone buy them I suggest going for a hike at Mt Bugkaksan and the view and fresh air there is so much more worth it than fighting to take pix with pushing and shoving rude nationals from youknowwhere Totally not worth the time money and effort to go there
4470,1,You can actually walk to the base of the N Tower but most people wait on the line to take the cable car The view from the park around the base of the tower is better than the view from the top of the tower costs extra so you might as well save yourself the time waiting on another line and the  The souvenir store is so brightly lit that you can only see out the window if you cup your hands around your face and thats if you can get past all the greasy smudges from everyone who has already been there before you My sister  I were extremely disappointed
4471,3,Personally I like N Seoul Tower because its a free attraction provided you dont go up the tower Ive been here twice now and have never been up the tower because of the long queue and the admission fee you can see the view yourself whether you take the cable car up or walk up For the more adventurous try walking up N Seoul Tower or walking one of the Namsan trails Great exercise and something different
4472,5,The observatory provided a birds eye view of Seoul regardless of the time of the day A post office was available at the observatory for travellers to write and send postcards to friends and family Love locks bridge was beautiful Namsan cable car was a great experience However staff would encourage more people to get on the cable car despite the fact the cable car was already full and stuffy This may affect the safety of passengers
4473,4,Nice to go at night for night view and very easy to go from myeongdong Prefer to take bus from Myeongdong Subway exit No 2 as its cheaper Remember to bring your love padlock if you are going couple or maybe you can get at the souvenir store located at N Seoul Tower
4474,4,Picturesque scene of the city Interesting experience as you take the lift up and down the tower making you feel like you are travelling into space Impressive details of distances  time written beautifully on every glass window from Seoul to all parts of the world There are nice resturants at the tower your choice if you wanna splurge to have a meal at the tower
4475,5,Namsan Seoul Tower is a must place to visit if you going to korea you can see beautiful seoul from here
4476,5,I have now been to n seoul tower in summer and winter Both times as beautiful There are lots of tourists at all times and many are there to attach locks to seal their love Theres also a small cafe but their food is nothing to shout about People are there for them view which is a picturesque scene of the city Have not been up the tower though as its an additional admission fee which is rather expensive
4477,4,We went to N Seoul Tower at night during mid Winter and because it was snowing we did not manage to get a good photo of the night scene of Seoul However being at top of the tallest tower in the city definitely gives you the best city view  It comes at a slightly steep price of 9000 Won to just head up to the observatory The journey on the lift up was extremely fast especially with the special effects from the LCD screen  This is definitely one of the must go attractions in Seoul so please do pick a good day to visit it
4478,5,Go at night to see the glimmering lights of Seoul in every direction Theres shopping and a cafe as well as the more expensive restaurants You need to call ahead to make reservations for the restaurants
4479,3,Great view from the observation deck give you the general landscape of Seoul and its surrounding areas
4480,4,We went to N Seoul tower in September at night The area is very beautiful the love locks and everything but I dont recommend going up as it is so so to me Its just another viewing deck Its not very big as well If you are into that kind of thing that it might be amazing to you Tokyo Tower is much better Id say its better to just strollsit around the area without going up Very long line for the cable car but its very quick
4481,2,T infamous landmark o Seoul  Seoul Tower s on Namsan Park and a fee has t b paid to travel up to c t panoramic view o Seoul city  There s also a restaurant where u can hv food
4482,5,Beautiful place worth to go at least twice totally different feeling to go during the day and night you will see beautiful night lights or even great fire works if you are lucky at night and nice city view during the day Strong recommend
4483,3,I was told that its better to visit the tower at night to view the night scenery and I wasnt disappointed The Christmasy atmosphere was enhanced when it suddenly snowed There was a steep climb on a slope and it was quite tiring for someone who does not exercise much Reaching the top of the tower in an elevator within 26 seconds there isnt much to do up there except view the night scene and visit the souvenir shop
4484,3,I visited the N Seoul Tower on a Sunday in October The lines were extremely long and it took almost 4 hours to get to the top and back down It was a bit overcast so the views werent great Not sure I would do this again I joked that all 25 million people in Seoul came to visit on the same day
4485,4,Its a good place to take pic of sunset though this time  the sunset is not beautiful enough to take pictures  But still the walk and the atmosphere during the autumn is still pleasant to go There are love locks trees where you can put the names of you and your lovers in the key lock and come back to see whether its still there later 
4486,5,It was freezing and we walked from Exit 3 of Myeongdong Subway Station to the cable car station which took over 15 minutes According to the homepage of N Seoul Tower there is a escalator near Exit 4 the lift is pretty tricky you need to walk a bit to the large intersection and then turn left seeing the cable car station is on the middle of the hill walk up a bit 5 min and you will see the lift  The Tower itself is a LOVE theme with a places full of LOVE locks couples must like it There is a ticket booth outdoor and indoor your ticket will shown a number and you can see when is your turn to go into the tower so there wont be a long queue waiting Instead you can start shopping some souvenirs or sit down have a cup of hot coffee which I think it is a very nice arrangement  The tower is on the top of Namsan so the view is absolutely stunning I went up at night and I believe it would be as good as the day time
4487,5,This is a fantastic spot in Seoul Take the time to hike up the mountain and enjoy some of the beautifully kept paths and gardens along the way
4488,4,View of the city is fabulous and even better at night Went on a cold windy day which detracted from the joy somewhat as the grounds and surrounding area are well worth walking and seeing but it was too cold to take advantage There is a cable car to reach the Tower from the staging area Several good restaurants in the tower but all quite pricey Bus number 03 from any stop in Itaewon will get you there Taxi is the fastest and most convenient
4489,5,Soul Tower is a same as others in Macau etc but the special about this tower is that it is located on Namsan Mountain and believe me this mountain is too scenic and beautiful If you can walk please do so that you can enjoy most scenic nature experience Spectacular views of Soul city and Han River  Being in Soul Do visit to Tower and Namsan Tower
4490,5,The N Seoul Tower is located at the top of Namsan Mount Nam and there are two ways to get there 1 climb the stairs to the top for free; or 2 pay a small fee and wait in a fairly long line for the cable car to whisk you up to the top in no time at all I chose to take the cable car up for the experience and to walk down after sunset I went on a Saturday  explains how busy it was  The grounds are fairly packed and there are some great photo opportunities along the way to the top there is a ground level deck at the base of the tower where there are nice views of the city and some tourist distractions gift shop etc in the tower  This is a very popular place so if you want to watch the sunset you MUST arrive early  as early as FOUR HOURS in advance of the sunset Plan for LONG lineups at the cablecar building for your ticket to go up the tower then for the elevator to actually go pup they make everyone take a greenscreened photo that they try to sell to you later The later you go the LONGER the lineup When I left after sunset the lineups were even longer than they were when I went up  Once you get to the observation deck at the top the views are simply breathtaking If you are there for sunset then even better There is of course a gift shop right at the top  TIP There is even an outgoing mailbox at the top where you can send postcards bought at the Towers gift shop of course
4491,4,Its a good place to view Seoul especially at night time we were lucky as the first time we went there  there was a martial art performance I have been there in Summer and also Winter and I feel that the excitement was all the same Will visit again in Spring next year Try the churros theregreat
4492,4,Nothing so special but it is a must fo site when u visit korea Offers a great night city view when you r up top Take the popcorn combo and sit by the tower platform just by the window Ticket price  okay Remember keep every piece of ticket I accidentally threw my cable car ticket when i was at the tower and had to purchase another one One thing i was dissapointed was  NO MORE TEDDY BEAR museum Instead they replace with another trickeye museum boring
4493,4,This is my first time experience riding in a cable car it was cool N Seoul tower is beautiful from afar and up close N Seoul tower was once the tallest tower in Asia You also see the view of Seoul from the top
4494,4,We went there by bus A incline walk is needed but not hard especially when you can see the colorful leaves on the trees all the way We havent visited the observatory as its a hazy day
4495,4,Nice and romantic place for couples or family to be  At the foot of the Seoul tower Under the moon and stars  Beautiful Nigh Scene Pananormic View of Seoul
4496,4,I visited the tower with my girlfriend and if you can thats really what you should do We took the cable car up which was fairly average but at the top we experienced an impressive 360 view of the whole city It is very coupleorientated there with opportunities to buy locks and add your own love lock to the plethora of ones already locked in I did not travel up the tower however just remained at the base
4497,4,The view on a clear day shows the expanse of Seoul Men you must use the toilets while up the tower you can still enjoy the view while using the toilet
4498,5,Very beautiful view of the entire city Make sure to go on a clear day Also even at the top of the hill Not even the top of the tower it is still a great view if you decide not to pay to go up but it is very cheap so definitely recommend it Only takes about an hour or so depending if you eat up there or just hang out
4499,4,There are some ways to get there  one is taking cable car another one is taking bus  N tower is 3hr level tour place  Night view is really good
4500,3,The tower can be planned as part of your visit if you have covered most of the places in Seoul since apart from the view from top there is nothing much Since the top of the tower is closed with glass enclosure unlike in say Eiffel tower  you feel a bit disconnected from the view  To reach the tower you will have to walk around half KM from nearest bus stop and metro  You can either walk all the way to the top which can be bit taxing Or take the option that I took of taking cable car from mid way of the hill to the tower  Do note that cable car entry may become crowded and will require you to wait for getting your turn  Once in the tower complex you need to collect ticket for going to top of the tower in lift View from is great though you get a feeling that they have tried a bit to replicate Eiffel tower  Best would be to visit in evening so that you can view the town before sun set and after dark
4501,3,Dont get your hopes up too high this isnt a great place to visit Do yourself a favor and walk up the mountain The paths are nice and wide and the scenery is nice Keep your eyes open there are plenty of small unmarked trails through the woods if youre not into the paved pathways Be prepared for the hoards of Chinese tourists when you get to the tower It is absolutely overrun with tourists Oh and dont take the bus the wait at the bus stop to return from the tower is madness I cant imagine how long of a wait it must be Overall it is a decent way to spend an afternoon if you dont have anything else to do Just keep your expectations low
4502,4,High view to see seoul city have teddy bear house cafe souvenir store etc have to be patient if you wanna use elevator but its worthed
4503,3,If you wanna burn some calories off you could hike your way up to the hill where the tower is nestled but there are also buses The elevator ride from the ground floor up to the uppermost floor is quick and very cool Youll pretty get it why once youre there  It has a very spectacular view of the entire city at night Dont forget to bring your love locks
4504,4,Altough it is somehow a challenge going up the tower but the views were awesome and simply breathtaking Lock my heart at the tower and hoping to return and see it again soon
4505,4,Though its raining a bit during my visit at night the ambiance is attractive By taking cable car to the bottom of Tower the city view is fascinating i believe its also good during daytime with maples  There are shops for souvenirs like miniature of N Seoul Tower notepads fan etc or simply buy a small brick with your words of wishes on it and paste to a wall very interesting
4506,4,The Seoul tower is a place to see whilst in Seoul it has a spectacular view of the city and the surrounding mountains If you love walking and hikes you can take a walk up in 1 of the 2 directions 1 of the ways is around 4Km and the other is around 2Km so you can choose whether you want to go up fast or slow If you are lazy and just want to get up then take the bus Best time to go would be around sunset where you will see the sun go down the moon come up and the city all around light up Make sure you post your loved ones a postcard at the post office at the observation deck in the tower ITs a Must If you want to enjoy the view further then there are restaurants in the lower observation deck where you can enjoy a meal with a lovely view Whatever way you prefer you will enjoy the time there  Have fun
4507,1,Skip Seoul Tower We usually dont write negative reviews but we are making an exception with Seoul Tower They have a funicular up to the cable car but the line was way too long so we walked up The line for the cable car was even worse The sign said the wait was one hour from where we stood but it was more like two hours We decided to stick it out because who knows when we will get to Seoul again Finally made it to the front of the line but the cable car ride was miserable They fit as many people as possible on the car Thank goodness you only ride the car for a few minutes We felt like we were on the Tokyo subway during rush hour Once on top the views are amazing but the crowds do not make it pleasant A lot of overpriced stores and restaurants The line to go back down was just as long so we walked a bit to find the buses but the lines for the bus were also long If you must go take a bus and go early
4508,5,Although the city was a bit smoggy when I visited you can see all of it from the top of the tower  There are several walking routes from subway stations up hill to the top 1 mile each or there are buses that make the rounds  You can get a combo ticket that includes the tromp loeil museum  the Alive museum  and the trip to the top of the tower
4509,4,Go during the evening great city view Ride the cable car from the base station get a return ticket Additional cost to go up the tower MeyeongDone line 4 is walking distance to the base Taxi cost a hands and leg if departing from there else taxi to the base is cheap Take the subway
4510,4,Big compound very clean touristfriendly  the view from top is beautiful I visited in the evening so bright colorful lights gave a different feel to the city view I took the Namsan cable car to  from the tower Had to queue a bit but it wasnt too bad N Seoul Tower is like a mixture of ancient culture  modern city There are traditional buildings in the compound while the tower itself is illuminated by bright animations So cool View of the city from any sky scrapers can be very similar  could be boring but theres always a different vibe  feel to every place So this place is surely worth the visit 
4511,4,This is a must see when you are visiting Seoul You can go by cable car or walk up the mountain Both ways provide a great view over the city Best kept secret when your up in the tower and watching the great view is to a least visit the mens room Im not going to tell you why but take your camera with you I dont know about the ladies room
4512,5,A lot of romantic couple here thanks to movies and drama But also you can see art performance every 3PM you can see music traditional performance martial art performance and you can take a picture with the art cast
4513,5,When we visited there were local folks dancing the traditional farmer dances The mood was festive and happy  The tower is packed but despite this the elevator service was quite fast Queue up a bit understandably but fast considering the volume of tourists going up and down the tower  Perfect voew of Seoul I wish couldve gone there at night too to enjoiy the lights  Souvenir prices are of course highly touristpriced
4514,4,Easy to get tickets at the base of the tower  the lift is quick and has a screen on the roof that suggests you are going into space  View from the top is great  if you are eating here make sure you book in advance and bring lots of money  Much cheaper to eat at the cafe in the base of the tower food o clock
4515,5,N Seoul Tower is a must see in my book especially for couples they have lovers locks which you can purchase and personalise which is a lovely touch and makes for great memories The cable car ride is fun and though im scared of heights I felt safe it can be a little crowded though The views from the top of the tower are simply stunning I loved my visit here and will definitely be back
4516,5,I walked up from the market and in November the scene is beautiful and the walk is pleasant U can see good view of seoul from the tower and u can put a love lock there I did not pay to go up the tower as the view is already good enough U can see this tower from most part in Seoul
4517,4,Nice place to visit for couples  Remember buy the lock first before you go up its quite expensive if you buy from there  Also highly recommend the Alive Museum
4518,4,we decided to visit the n seoul tower at night to see the colors of the tower at the night panoramic view of the seoul but I am bit disappointed the place is dark outside you can see the place when you must put padlock expensive and less things to do we use cable car back and fort to see the view of seoul
4519,4,Hooked to the top of the hill and visited the tower Much like any other tower but its great to see the city from up there Check it out
4520,4,N Seoul Tower offers a majestic 360 degree view of Seoul Well worth a visit if you find yourself in Seoul To access the tower you must climb a very steep road so consider this if youre handicapped and traveling with an elderly person
4521,3,not a special place because every city has its own tower u can see the whole city from here night view is good but you have to waiting for the cable car for a long time but on the top of the tower some famous korea drama were taken here that is why so many people visit here if you love korea drama u should come the price is high there is a Teddy bear shop here it is so cute it is very special but it will close early so find out the right time
4522,3,Went up using the cable car which is nice The cable car staffs are quite helpful too and the safety rules are good as one of the staff will get on the cable car along with us  Namsan tower is quite overrated but the view is nice LOTS AND LOTS of people up here Nothing else to do aside from watching the city view Coz the last time I was here the Teddy Bear Museum was still closed for renovations
4523,4,Seoul N Tower has a great view of the old city center if the weather is clear like in Autumn The tower is already located on a mountain Hence theres no need to go up to the top of the tower to see any better view since it is pretty much the same on the ground level Lovers lockers are crazy all around the safety barriers It used to be more beautiful but it became too much of it everywhere Nothing much unless you are so romantic to add yours  I personally recommend everyone to take a cable to go up because only cable cars yellow public shuttles and climbing are possible Private cars and cabs are not allowed in the mountain When you go back to the city I recommend to walk down as it is quite easy walk for about an hour and has a good view point on the way Personally Id say night view seems way better than day one
4524,4,The views from there are wonderful but in my opinion 63 Floors building its better especially at night because you can see the river
4525,3,I went to the tower before going to Myeongdong shopping area Definitely nice to go there if the night skys clear I definitely recommend using the elevator as it was hard to locate the cable car site on foot It might be a place for couples to put their padlocks in the rail but I think travelling solo to this area has one of its perks too Theres a small souvenir and eating shops within the facility but I would rather save my hunger and wait until I arrive at Myeongdong street shops to eat Security is not an issue for solo travellers
4526,4,It is one of the best viewing spot that you can see the whole Seoul Landscape But that is it The escalator is quite fast and smoother with screen on the ceiling of it
4527,3,Went to the tower got the return cable car trip as we were at the end of a business trip  note you pay for the cable car and then again for the tower Nice place to get a view of seoul Just make sure its a clear day There are thousands of love padlocks So if you are a romantic bring a pad lock along 
4528,5,You can either hike or simply take the cable car up 8000 won per person To avoid super long queue please go on a weekday which I did Due to the cold season the peak was a little foggy The scenery will be much nicer if it is spring or summer Dont forget to bring along marker and a padlock to lock your love messages Though you can always purchase them at the sourvenirs shop but at an escalated price We spent around 2hrs on top and really enjoyed the nice scenery and the fresh air There are a few eateries and cafes so no worries about where to get drinks and food I must say that this place is a must go when youre in Seoul Furthermore after youre done you can always make your way to Insadong shopping for more sourvenirs and food which is like 10  15mins walk
4529,3,This is a good place to spend half of your day including transpo to  fro Myeongdong area At first we tried waiting for the free shuttle service yellow minibus going to the cable car station at Myeongdong stn exit 3 but decided to take a cab 3000won after 15mins of waiting Bus is another option of going all the way to the tower The queue to the cable car is still short as we were there past 10am We didnt went up the observation tower as my wife is not into it but enjoyed the place still There is a trick eye museum i believe souvenir shops and a number of restos at a little higher price Overall we stay at the N Seoul Tower for almost 3hrs and we went down now using the free shuttle bus stationed along the road near parked vehicles just outside the exit of cable car station The shuttle bus passes by Seoul Station so we decided to alight there and check Lotte Outlets now this is another story;
4530,5,I really love this place even though it was quite hot as I went in the afternoon The burger restaurant serves delicious hot dog bun and fries We also bought the lock from there Unfortunately the key deposit box was cordoned off as they were doing maintenance work at that area so we had to bring the key back instead
4531,1,Travel up to seoul Tower by Cable car 8000 won per pax Long quene for ticket and over crowd Tower light color no change even we stay nearby tower and can see through 8 days Nothing special compared to Hong Kong If go inside tower need to pay another fee So expensive
4532,5,My friends and I finished out our day at Namsan Tower That night it was lit red though on different nights it is different colors Unless you are in good physical shape Id recommend taking a bus most of the way or the cable car Im somewhat challenged physically and even the last part was a tough climb but was definitely well worth it I now have a love lock at the top among hundreds of thousands of others
4533,4,Its a fantastic view of Seoul that you get from the tower on a clear day Its hard to imagine really how big this city is but once you look out from the tower windows you realize what a huge place this is Even the ride in the cableway is fantastic
4534,5,Even though I went on a slightly cloudy day  that didnt stop me from seeing the beauty of Seoul South Korea The tower itself and the locks surrounded every where you look is definitely a sight to see They also have a customary post card station where you can buy adorable post cards and send them off right there A great idea for which I wish I had my addresses so I could have used the service Being a camera to take beautiful shots
4535,4,Seoul tower is not just a tower you can enjoy park  nice weather  hiking and even cable car experience  the only problem they charge u too much  return ticket for cable car 9 dollar for going up to tower 10 bucks and you will spending more money than u expect 
4536,4,This was my last stop on a full day strolling around Seoul The decision to do it late afternoon was perfect I had first great sunshine then sun set and at the end the city view at night The money spend to get there is well worth while Not to miss while in Seoul
4537,4,Located on the top of the Namsan mountain and Visible from almost every corner of the city this tower is one of the symbols of Seoul You have two options to reach it 1take the cable car from near the Myeongdong station 2walkhike through the Namsan park If you feel energetic I would definitely recommend the second way It would take 2030 minutes and the cable car actually does not take you a long distance You would only save 1 kilometer or so Along the path you would stop and see the city view from different angles Once you are on top of the mountain you can take a lift to the top of the tower but this is a little pricey and basically the view is the same
4538,5,A great way to get oriented to the city But be prepared for an uphill hike from the hop on  hop off bus stop There is a fountain for kids to play in and a pagoda to eat a picnic lunch You can buy food and souvenirs in the tower Dont miss the love locks
4539,4,Namsan Tower is a fairly nice and big tower that is a must if youre visiting Seoul It is pricey and designed for tourists so know what to expect However this alone should not hold you back Namsan Tower is itself located on top of the bigger Namsan Mountain right in the middle of Seoul Going up the mountain and up the tower gives you an altitude of 500meters or so with stunning view of most of the cities landmarks including GyeongBokGung Jongno Dongdaemun Design Plaza Lotte World Tower Gangnam Yeouido Also great to get a glimse of the size of the city as well as the omnipresent nature Han river endless succession of hills and mountains Try to go there in late afternoon so you can enjoy both the day view and the impressive nightscape is you stick there a bit longer
4540,5,We were staying at the Grand Ambassador hotel and so opted to walk up to the tower instead of catching the bus It was a lovely walk plenty of steps passing an archery club outdoor gym and lots of wonderful scenery Once at the tower we went up enjoyed the views bought a lock and wrote our names on it and attached it to the viewing platform We caught the cable car back down into Myeongdong Must do activity in Seoul We went mid morning weekday and the crowds were fine
4541,4,Make sure to be there before sunset to see the beautiful transition of the landscape from daylight to sunset  Tips Bring a lock and put it on the love locks area Buy a one way ticket for the cable car and walk going down instead
4542,5,In the evening is the perfect time to visit view its amazing there are a few shops near for couples and not only many tourist
4543,4,I had a great visit to the N Seoul Tower with my wife around sunset in late October While there is a beautiful view from the observation tower it is crowded and is very akin to observation decks in skyscrapers in other big cities I didnt find it particularly romantic but Romance is highly pushed by the marketing within the tower The thing to do at the base of the tower is buy a key lock and lock it to one of the fences with you and your partners name on it There are literally tens if not hundreds of thousands of these locks in designated area It only costs the equivalent of a few dollars to purchase a lock and it is somewhat kitschy and fun to do Some of the locks are on fences and others linked to treelike structures that form a pattern of trees or other sculptures Also to note there are two stories to the observation deck Thus if you are there at sunset and it is very crowded I recommend going to the lower floor where there is less of a crowd The hike up Mountain is a nice alternative to the cable car and includes great views and a nice park setting It is well paved and not particularly steep there are probably a few hundred steps on the way up As long as you are in reasonably good shape or just young it shouldnt be difficult The tower itself has several good but very touristy restaurants at the base including many Western establishments Dunkin Donuts Cold Stone Creamery etc
4544,4,The place is really accessible for tourists on DIY From Myeongdong Station you can ride the Namsan Cable Car for just less than 10 dollars roundtrip and you can walk your way to the tower passing at the Namsan Park What we did after visiting the War Memorial we took a taxi then proceed to the bus stopstation and wait for the bus  forgot the bus number but they have guides at the station Bus fee 1000 won Or if your feet arent sore you can have an uphill walk to the tower for about 2030 minutes Remember the bus cannot bring you straight to the toweryou have to walk against gravity for around 5m pretty tiring after a whole day tour They have buffet packages plus entrance to the tower but we choose to pay 10000 won for tower entrance with free popcorn and soft drinks Too bad you cannot take good pictures at the tower as it is covered by glass unlike in the Baiyoke Hotel in Bangkok For first timers i think its a must visit this place but once is quite enough You can use the subway and ride a taxi but only buses are allowed to the tower itself Taxis will drop you at the bus station
4545,5,Its a a beautiful tower I went there in the afternoon However I wont be in the crowded and I can see a lot of beautiful day views of Seoul Anyway u should visit here when visiting Seoul
4546,5,do the hike up you will feel like you earned the great view and a cold beer or pocari to boot
4547,4,Went on a national holiday on the night of a fireworks display it was very busy and people were sitting in front of the windows so it was difficult to get a good view on the side of the Han river Great views we walked up the mountain to get to the tower and it had multiple observation platforms
4548,4,Queue up for 45 minutes just for the cable car on a Sunday evening But the view is great and the food is nice too
4549,4,We visited N Seoul Tower at night and the view from the observation deck was quite lovely It was a good view 360degree of the city Maybe it would be best to visit during the day to avoid the crowd There were juts so many people going to the tower most of them students who were so noisy The lifts were crowded and there was quite a long waiting line The restaurants were also full
4550,4,We went here twice the first time was at night and we ate at Hancook and the second time during the day and ate the burger bar  Hancook was amazing and well worth the price you also got to up the tower with the price of the buffet too  The burger bar was pretty good and was great to be able to see all the love locks near by  The cable car was fine as a person scared of rides and heights I didnt feel scared at all
4551,4,We took the cable car up the Tower just for the experience and it was nice Just be ready to take on about a hundred steps up but you can always rest along the way  I just loved seeing the city below as the city lights turned on The weather was perfect and there were a lot to see but I just chose to linger on watching the city below I would definitely go back again probably another season
4552,4,a scenic place to at the top of namsan park u can either hike up to it or pay and take the cable car i did not go up to the tower because theres a entry fee and the price bundle with food is overprice i was lucky enough to watch the ancient warrior fighting show which happened to perform on that day my advise to bring your own food and water if u plan to spend your half day there it would be great to have a picnic there
4553,4,N Seoul Tower is a much loved Seoul landmark the night we visited their was a light art show on the tower which was entertaining If you go to Seoul this is one place you need to visit The view was spectacular; N Grill restaurant offered reasonable service staff were attentive and polite; food was just okay the location and the view are the selling points a little unfortunate the food didnt reach those heights
4554,3,I jave been twice so far once each time I come to work in South Korea The view is gorgeous and the gift shops are quite quaint and the restaurants are ok but the real prize is the peacefulness and tranquility Also dont forget to take the tours and visit the museum
4555,4,Take the bus to the Tower from Seoul Station and avoid the long lines for the cable car or from another station if you like  but take the bus
4556,5,Great view of the whole city esp at night the spectacular colorful lights of the city at nighttime Very cool fresh air with the green trees and plants all around the area of the tower Wide parking area available with all the facilities for the visiting tourists r with the green trees surrounding the area of the tower
4557,3,Very touristy and crowded the view is ok you will get to see the whole seoul but you need to squeeze your way through
4558,5,We enjoyed this place for the views and the museum exhibit The exhibit is a kind of believe it or not type full of optical illusions and the like great fun for a family even our 15 year old enjoyed it makes for great family photos The tower itself was of course similar to towers of they type around the world Well done enjoyable lovely views
4559,3,Its quite a hike up from the parking lot so be sure to wear comfortable shoes The elderly might find it a little difficult to go up just ask them to take it slowly  At the foot of the tower you get to see thousands of locks one for each pair of lovers who promised to love each other forever Also there were upright Vshaped benches so when couples sit they would slide to the middle of each bench and be as close as possible to each other Inside the building there was a spot with a green screen where you can take photos and they will put a background behind you You can purchase your photos once you reach the top 10000 won each  The elevator ride to the top of the tower had a 30second video to make us feel like we were going up in space  The view at the top was great but not really breathtaking Look for the spot where you can face your country  They say the mens room was quite interesting cause you will be facing the whole of Korea while you do your business there I wouldnt know cause Im a girl
4560,5,The walk is up hill to the tower and parking is at best tight though I would definitively see this at night as the views are incredible
4561,3,as i and my friend take bus to the foot of the N Seoul Tower U have to walk a steep slope up the top but the scenery beautiful
4562,5,We went in the evening While it was busy it was worth the wait Great to get an understanding of the layout of Seoul
4563,5,We got a bit lost trying to make our way to the top on foot Beautifully maintained park After exploring around a long time we accidentally got on a bus at the bottom that took us right to the top Good for a clear day
4564,5,Most of cities around the world written with the distance It is free if you just wanna see the tower But you need to pay if you wanna go up to the tower
4565,4,Well if you are in Seoul might as well take a look at it from its highest point  These panoramic views are always breathtaking and this is no exception Took us a little time to reach the front of the queue the place is always busy  Have a drink at the top go in the evening the night lights always make the scenery prettier  Check out how far your home is you can see the distances to the major cities around the room on the glass walls
4566,4,We went with the hop on and hop off city tour bus We stopped by for a while near where the bus dropped us The city view of Seoul was amazing
4567,5,Quite popular place to go for every traveler The scenery is so nice even in the morning Hope next time I can go there at night
4568,4,There is something different each year Being that it was my 7th trip to Seoul I prefer not to go there and would like to visit other places of interest
4569,5,Either by day or by night no matter if you are in Seoul for the first time or if youre an old friend in this city it is a place with surprising views The tower and observation deck are at the top of a hill in the middle of the city You can climb the hill by car using the stairs and enjoy the greenery My favorite way the cable car At the top you have many options cafes a museum souvenir shops a wall where couples put padlocks with their names or any promise and much more It is definitely a romantic place but has a lot to offer if you come with family or alone There is a good restaurant up in the tower serving French and international cuisine that I personally recommend the food is up to par and the views are great It is an excellent and romantic option for a dinner with that special someone
4570,4,You might think N Seoul Tower is only for beautiful views and you are half right Its also a famous place for lovers The 2nd floor terrace which is free of charge are full of love locks Bring a lock write a message and lock at those grill There are also love chairsbenches  There is also a beautiful pavilion and beacon lighthouse as attraction You can arrive here via car bus subwaywalkingcable car or hiking Ive been here twice and still couldnt get enough of it
4571,4,N Seoul Tower is a popular place for datesThe Roof Terrace is a spacious wooden viewing deck whose exotic atmosphere makes it very popular with lovers A recent attraction for courting couples is Locks of Love thousands of padlocks attached to the fence by romantic Seoulites symbolizing their undying affection It is not permitted to throw your keys over the fence
4572,5,It is very romantic place I was on this tower in June and October It so beautiful IThis is my favorite place in Seoul
4573,3,I had initially intended on taking a bus to the tower however somehow I got lost and there was no obvious stop at the bottom of the road up to the tower So I ended up hiking the 3km trail to the top in the middle of July  if you do this make sure you bring lots of water as it is both hot and humid  The hike itself was really nice and there were many different flowers and trees bordering the trail Unfortunately the view wasnt so spectacular since it was so humid and foggy the day that I went  At the top they definitely play up the love theme with heart flower arrangements the chance to buy lovers locks if you didnt bring your own and attach it to the lock trees and the benches are slanted inwards so that you sit closer to your loved one I went to the restaurant on the main floor which was a bit pricey also decided going up wasnt worth the  since you already can see out at the main level  I think that other times during the year Spring or Fall when it isnt so muggy the view would be much nicer or even at night when the tower is lit up Regardless though it still was an enjoyable attraction that CAN be free if you hike to the top and forego the extra lift to the top
4574,4,Came here with my fiancee and bought our love locks The place had so many love locks that they created a tree from the past ones being hung their There were also other items latched to the locks like phone cover or casings seriously what is wrong with people We got their via out tour bus but we still had to walk up to the tower You must walk carefully though as the road can be slippery Going up the tower costs a bit but I was told that the view up in the tower is just the same with the one in the deck so we decided to pass on that and instead bought some big ice cream I suggest going to the area at around 6PM autumnfall season so that it wont be too hot and you can see the city getting engulfed by the night sky
4575,5,I love the 360 degrees view of Seoul and it also gives you information how many miles away from the tower the other capital cities of other countries You will also enjoy the Teddy Bear museum and the padlocks of love found in here
4576,5,As you guys know N seoul tower is really popural place in seoul I visited here when it gets dark it was really beautiful If you traveling alone I can also recommend the guide who brought me this places Her name is Bora and she knows lots place that I can find in Seoul  Her number is 821033436080 It was my best travel ever
4577,5,The highest point in Seoul allows you to experience an amazing view of the city below Being from a small town in Ireland Wexford the view of this calibre was quite amazing for me Definitely a photographer paradise It was a clear and sunny day so luckily I was able to see everything  You do have to pay to go up but if youre gonna go to Seoul you have to experience the views from the N Seoul Tower Its worth it and you will definitely regret it if you dont
4578,5,Love tower allows you to get a lock and secure your love forever You also get a beautiful view of Myeongdong Seouland the adventure of getting to the top is a great site as well
4579,5,Should be on your TODOLIST I got there by the Touristic Bus which i recommend a lot Many things to do up there besides taking pictures and walking around
4580,4,We went here in July of 2014 It was very hot and humid There was no public elevator for visitors to take to the tower itself once you got off the cable car I estimated it was equivalent to about 10 flights of stairs we had to walk up We had to sit once we got to the top of the stairs to recuperate It wasnt too bad though I think it was just the weather that made it so unbearable Once we got off the stairs there was a neat Gazebo to relax at and a show of a guy with some swords that was cool The tower itself was great Everything inside was very clean and it was fun to walk around and take pictures of the skyline I would definitely recommend trying to go on a clear day for the best views
4581,4,We decided to do this on foot instead of taking the cable car The walk is quite long but in autumn is very pleasant as the leaves on the various trees make for beautiful scenery You will also see many joggers who have come to get away from Seouls high levels of pollution  The views are very nice particularly at night A worthwhile see  I would recommend taking a pack lunch with you if on a budget as the shops are quite dear at the summit
4582,4,I like the cherry blossom very much Also there were plenty of flowers and trees Whats more the air was fresh and I felt rather relaxed there
4583,5,Very nice place to enjoy noght scenery  You will see different color of tower according to the weather condition This is one of the best place to see Seoul around And funny rest room
4584,4,A pricey restaurant is located here with decent food but its the view thats really worth paying for It overlooks all of Seoul with half the countrys population of 25 million inside of it located in the older part of north Seoul
4585,4,My second visit of N Seoul Tower was better than the first because I actually went up to take in the view I am wary of city towers because of the crowds but N Seoul was not too busy when I got there and maybe better organized than many similar structures The view was stunning but I actually enjoyed the fun atmosphere with people taking selfies just hanging out or ogling the famous love padlocks area below It is a popular stop for most Seoul visitors with good reason On a sunny day photos do come out very well The food options here are not great but serviceable enough with burgers and fast food The souvenir shops are nice and service efficient The ride up Namsan was quite good I appreciated the fact that Seoul is still pretty much a hilly kind of city and you are never too far from nature and lots of greenery N Seoul Tower and Namsan can be a pleasant change of pace from the furious shopping most do when visiting the city
4586,4,Ive been before I live here in Seoul and enjoyed it every time this time I took my mother up to see it Admittedly we got a little lost trying to find the right way up to the tower  tried walking it first but evidently used the wrong road which while a very nice walk took us around the mountain instead of up it so we went back and took the skycar up instead That gives some great views but is very crowded only use it if you dont mind getting up close and personal with strangers The tower itself is ok the views from the top are fantastic even on dull days  and at night the city lights up gorgeously It is very crowded up top and the queue can take a while but if you dont mind a wait its worth it I recommend walking down if you can do that because you get some lovely views from various points on the stair case on the way down
4587,3,Very suitable for young couples Its kind of sad of singles especially when you pass by the lovelock bridge You suddenly feel lonely and love deprived XD But other then that the view was great
4588,4,The tower offers a great view of the city as long as the pollution doesnt obstruct your view Be sure to take the elevator and then the lift to the topthe hills are very steep  Be patient; just like everything else in Korea it will be crowded Bring water and snacks unless you want to pay the tourist prices at the top
4589,5,In N seoul tower my boy and i bought a lock and lock on the tower Also we did buy a tiles and write our names on Shy
4590,3,The ticket is very expensive If it is your first time in seoul you can visit this One visit is enough I enjoyed walking around namsan park better
4591,5,The view is awesome good for photographers We went there on a night time and there were lots of people
4592,4,Arrival You have to stay calm because of the crowd I went in the evening so did many others The prospect of viewing Seouls night lights seem enticing I faced about an hours wait to go into the lift to bring the visitors up the observatory I dont mind the wait but there were not enough seats or rest areas for people who were waiting Some just made themselves comfortable on the floor For me i found an air con draft and stood at the same spot for almost 1 hour Note If you are coming by bus there is a steep hill for you to conquer so advisable to have comfortable walking shoes on  Wait is over or is it The lift ride simulated somewhat like a rocket taking off with effects and all Frankly I din enjoy it that much because we were all packed like sardines in the lift SO instead of going wow look at the cool effects on the ceiling of the lift I was hoping the lift ride will end ASAP  View from the top The view from the observatory was great Crowds get into your face sometimes Some will hog the glass panels and rest themselves at the panels  selfies etc so STAY CALM and wait or walk around before coming back They have the signs that will point in the direction of you hometown stating the distance you are away from home There is a mailbox at the souvenir shop Apparently its the highest postbox or something Many people were trying to send postcards purchased from the shop back home to their loved ones Do have a pen with you if you intend on doing so  Final comments Interesting experience but my wait and travel is much longer than the time i spend there Nice scenery but I wont be going back if i return to Seoul
4593,4,N tower is one of the best place to chill out make sure u take the bus to go up taxi only will take you to the bottom of the hill entrance u need to walk up which will take about 3040 minutes other alternative is take their cable car unless u like to walk so much very nice show at nite
4594,5,Great views  Although it can be quite crowded and swarmed with visitors I would recommend visitors to go an hour before the sunsets to witness Seoul in the day and be overwhelmed by the night lights and night view of the brilliant city  If you do remember buy a lock before heading to the tower as they say to lock your love forever But if you dont no worries the Namsan tower gift shops do sell a variety of adorable locks for your convenience although it is expensive  Definitely will head back there again
4595,4,I disliked the crowd but everything else was great We visited at night and although it was a foggy night we still enjoyed looking down at the city I like how the lights they have put up blended so well with the surroundings and it even looks stunning in the photos
4596,4,Its probably the best view of Seoul You pay a few thousand won take the lift up and admire the view Simple
4597,4,We arrived almost dusk and decided to have dinner in one of the restaurants The view on top was magnificent You can see Seoul all bright and twinkly Enjoyed the view but not the walk after alighting from the taxi going there Going back was a different and easy experience for we took the cable car Had fun
4598,4,This place was not bed than I thought It was hard to reach theretransportation was not good There were too many people and weather was too hot I prefer to come here at night Night time will be better
4599,4,We went to the Seoul Tower on a recent trip to South Korea The view is spectacular though we didnt have a particularly clear day It was neat to see the distance to so many other places including North Korea I must also report that I have never used a bathroom with a more beautiful view
4600,4,It was very beautiful scenery during cherry blossom festive And at night you can see the beautiful colourful city of Seoul from this tower And for youcouples in lovedont forget to put your couple padlocks there and wish your love will last forever
4601,3,I liked this placebut make sure you visit with your someone speciala place to visit in eveningnightpretty expensive thoughlast thing avoid weekendor else youll waste around 15 hours reaching to the tower bottom from cable car entrance
4602,4,when you go there and youre with a couple you might wanna bring your own love padlock i mean there charging YOWZA up therewhen we it wasnt holiday season so thank god the queues wasnt long so thats bonus for us for me when i go there i travel up by cable car if not you have to walk all the way up but then if you wanna go down i recommend you walk down and just take your time and enjoy the view it was around 14 degree for me that time so it was just nice the green give you the fresh air the view from was just beautiful   best time to go is around 67pm that when it get really beautiful and then when you go down youre just in time fir dinner
4603,3,We wanted to visit this at dusk so we could see Seoul as it just got dark You have to walk up a rather steep hill from the station for about 1015 minutes before you get to the cable care station We timed it perfectly in getting there but the queue to get on the cable car up to the tower were massive We waited about 20 mins to get our tickets then queued for an extra 45 minutes just to get on the cable car up there By this time we thought we would just give the actual tower observatory a miss and look at it from the viewing platform outside of the tower The view was still breath taking but I am not sure it was worth all the waiting around A mass of tourists are up here all fighting the get the perfect picture You can also put a lovers lock on the gates up there but it just seemed a little too pushed and commercialised to actually enjoy
4604,5,We went at night  the views are awesome the trolley ride up was a great experience with spectacular views as well If you are a couple take a lock with you and a marker to write on it when you arrive at the top You can place the lock along with thousands of others and go back in the future and try to find it Lots of walking and stairs but worth the effort once you get to the top
4605,3,Prepare to wait in line That is then followed by a linethen another line This is due to only having 2 cable cars going up and down the mountain This site desperately needs more Once The the top the views are good Still some lines but it is worth a look Just prepare to wait
4606,5,Place best for couples For friends still a good place to take many pictures and wow at the many locks even though the fence is almost falling backwards on its spine Good place to enjoy the wind and scenery May be better to come near 79pm to catch the 8pm light show depending what kind of view are you looking for
4607,4,Was there with the family Went on a week day late morning Took the cable car ride up The view on way up was not that spectacular The interesting part about this place is the massive numbers of locks with lovey dovey messages placed on a few Christmas tree like structure and along the metal railings Me n my teenage girls had fun reading some of the interesting n eye catching ones   There was a martial arts demo traditional drum dance n hanbok free rental when we were there We could wear the hanbok n walk around the compound to take photos But its a one off culture event they were having n we were lucky to be three at the right time  We decided not to go up into the tower as we reckon the view is better at night than afternoon so we just had lunch Theres a japanese fusion restaurant n a burger restaurant Both pricing are reasonable n taste good  Would recommend to go in the evening night  The weather is cooler n I believe the view will be spectacular with the lights up Understand theres a fine dinning restaurant up in the tower so I guess it will be a romantic night out for couples    As for my family we had a great afternoon outing having fun taking photos in our hanbok  
4608,4,Great way to see Seoul for the massive sprawling city that it is If you want there is a Love Lock display like in Paris Also the restaurant has ice cold beer to escape the intense summer heat and enjoy the view
4609,4,I visited the N Seoul Tower during my recent trip to Seoul and Im REALLY glad that I made the hike While there are multiple ways to visit the tower I opted to walk all the way up to the base of the tower which was QUITE the workout If youre not feeling up to the physical challenge you can always take the cable car up which I suspect would be a pretty cool experience Once at the base of the tower one can purchase tickets to visit the viewing deck high above the city RECOMMENDATION If you intend to go up to the viewing deck then do so during the day The glass makes and lighting diminish the view at night
4610,3,We failed to reach the tower The waiting line to the lift was so long and the weather was so hot in May that we decided not to go ate at a restaurant a pork steak instead and returned So dont plan on doing it on weekend like we did
4611,4,This is one of the crowded place that we visit Start from the cable car then going up to the tower then taking a fast lift to take you to the top of the tower was very tough effort but when we arrived on the top we will see a stunning city view of Seoul Just pray for a clear day otherwise the fog will disturbing our vision Every reachable floor we will find a coffe shoprestaurantsouvenir shop
4612,4,Expect pretty big crowds of tourists at the base and at the top of the tower Also expect incredible views You have amazing 360 degree views of the city at the top Seoul is ranked 3 in the world for total population and it takes going to the top to fully appreciate the sheer size I would recommend it if you dont mind waiting a few minutes for an elevator ride
4613,3,The Tower is packed with tourists I had to wait 10min for my ticket 40 min for the elevator up and 30min for the elevator back down from the observatory The view is quite nice but everything here says Spend money For me there are too many restaurants souvenir shops people taking fotos of you 
4614,3,Namsan have a great view of the city If you want a visual to orient you to where you are go up the tower
4615,3,Nice overview of the city I went there in a Sunday it was very crowded and there were some traditional Korea presentations in the park around the tower
4616,4,Went in july 2014 Nice view from the top Interesting souvenir shops and food and drinks places Location of the famous area to put your padlocks and lock it away All in all an interesting area to see when in Seoul
4617,5,A quick elevator trip to the top It reminded me of the Burj in Dubai Though not so high but still a pleasant lift to the top and an awesome view from there Whole lot of eating joints down  You can wish and put a lock down near the food joints Place is always crowded Well you have a nice climb up the well done path
4618,5,nice place and must visit while travel to seoul you can a postcard from tower to your hometownplease aspecting around 2 weeks after
4619,3,actually nothing interesting in here you only go upstairs and see the panorama of Seoul its better to visit this tower at night you can see lots of lamps and its beautiful there is also teddy bear museum unfortunately when i visited its closed dont forget to take a look at famous love padlock place if you visit with your couple then try it lots of couple when i visited this place
4620,3,It is a very tall tower offering panoramic views of Seoul city  a glorious magnificent sight especially if viewed from the topmost viewing deck  There were many people vying to go up hence this place is packed and one is prepared to jostle with the crowd  This long solitary tower standing tall against the city looks like a beacon itself  sweeping views of bustling Seoul city all in one glance  For more detailed information and photos please feel free to visit httpthearcticstarblogspotsg201312kaptivatingkoreahtml
4621,3,Visited here in autumn as part of a group tour Small compound congested with people The Kaleidoscopic colours of the surrounding foliage complement the monotonous solitary tower Get to look at huge numbers of locks locked on to the fence
4622,2,After paying to take the cable car to the tower there is an additional and quite exorbitant fee to go to the top of the tower itself The grounds are quite small and clearly cater to tourists or young couples on a date Not much to do so we walked back down
4623,3,the love locks were everywhere so were the tourists Took the cable car to Namsan tower and there were performances in the afternoon as well
4624,4,We took the cable car which is a fun if little cramped experience Once you get to the top of the hill there are paths to walk around the hill shops and restaurants and of course the tower We watched the sun set over Seoul from a bar at the top of the hill before you go into the tower  a lovely way to end the day
4625,4,Experiencing Seoul from a different perspective where you can see the city from a hill the cable car ride is fun A lot of things to do while in Seoul; do it if you are around
4626,4,During our stay in Seoul the sky was almost always foggy but the day we had decided to go to Seould tower was almost clear The service is good and the price affordable 9000 won pp for adults During the way up they take a photo which is optional to buy when you get to the top At the top is a souvenier shop and one floor down is a cafe At the bottom are multiple restaurants and shops
4627,5,Love the view on top which is a rotation restaurant foods are expensive though but youre not obliged to buy anything but you will have to pay for the elevator ride and access to the rotating view deck fare is not that much so its ok
4628,4,Nice place to catch a glimpse of the whole Seoul city You can get a free shuttle bus ride to go all the way up at certain area Entrance fees are a pricey but its worth it for once in the life time They have plenty of souvenirs at the Tower Just the exit of the tower there is a place where you can engraved the name of you and your loved one to lock Lock it near the tower to ensure love lasting forever as they say
4629,4,N Seoul Tower is a must visit tourist attraction One should plan their visit towards evening thru cable car to see beautiful views greenery in day light on the way to N Tower and hangout or take stroll around near N Tower area in the gardens Head towards the N Tower as soon as its dark to see breathtaking views of City fully lit up you will get to see 360 degree view You can send post cards to your loved ones from the worlds top most Post officebox Go and Enjoy  Cheers NT
4630,4,Took the cable car ride to and from the towerThere were many people so the queues were abit longThe vies of seoul in the early evening was worth visitA large area to lounge and take pictures of the scenic seoul skylineCarry your own snacks and drinks as there is no much option
4631,5,go here in 2012 and theres a teddy bear museum there but now its closed from bovember 2013 see from their websites and they change the museum in to 3d picture museum there still open the small shop for teddy bear product trying to send the postcard from n tower for your beloved ones 
4632,4,Great place to get your bearings of the layout of the city Not for hazy day of which there are many in Seoul
4633,5,All visit to Seoul be without a trip up to N Seoul Tower The view of Seoul especially the night view is just too good to be missed Too bad they closed the Teddy Bear Museum already when we were there but the gift shop alone is sufficient The surrounding were nicely decorated We love the place with the lock the most Cafes there is the nice place to end your evening there
4634,5,Went there with my girlfriend and her family  Walked up quite a steep maybe 1km from the train station t the cable car station My advice is that if youre traveling with someone not as fit as you take a bus up  From the cable car ride its about 2 hr or less hike to the top or take the cable car at extra cost  The atmosphere at the top is wonderful Really romantic with the Love Locks They sell them there incase you didnt bring any  The vew from the top is great on a clear day But its at extra cost which i would pay for the visit Even though it seems alittle pricy  Once really cool thing i like inside at the top is that they have a post box where you can buy a postcard and stamps and drop it off  Worth another visit ill hike up the hill the next time but probably may not visit the top of tower unless im with friends who havent  Cheers
4635,5,its just beautiful destinationEvery one going to seoul must go there its more beautiful at nightTheres museumcafesshops just everything you could ask forChoose cable car ride or take the tour bus which passes through the beautiful scenery
4636,4,Just liking it When you go all the way up Yes you can see the city of seoul from the sky When you go below the building Yes there is a lot of cute teddy bear I used the cable car to go up and down to this attraction Just loving all the surrounding area even before you go up to the tower
4637,3,Id recommend just to get on top of the hill on the cableway and walk at that area but no need to go on top of the tower  nothing really special or breathtaking there
4638,5,Its so fun when u go with your loved ones I walked from Myeongdong station exit 4 to namsam cable car Since its on weekday not much ppl queuing for cable car ride The climb to the tower is awesome and the view is breathtaking Must visit in seoul
4639,5,Once at the top of the hill there are restaurants and different cultural displays such as martial arts display We spent a whole day here Very fun and great environment for relaxing too
4640,4,We had a reservation at nGrill the revolving restaurant in the tower and arrived 30 minutes before our reservation When we arrived we were shocked to realize that there was a line and an overanhour wait Luckily I asked the staff and told them we had a reservation at the restaurant and they were very accommodating and put us on the next cable car to the top of the mountain  The view is beautiful and we had a wonderful night but actually I would say that the view is the same as any other city at night Still very happy we went And many thanks to the staff
4641,4,Well we caught the cable car up after a short taxi ride very quick to board and views on the way up pretty good The top viewing deck gives you a great view of the city and we thought it was worth the effort  We were lucky on the day to have an exhibition of swords fighting and how sharp they were in clouding a juggling act that was quite fun to watch or participate if you are picked out  Pick your day as there can be heavy smog in morningsbut we had a good day  If in seoul worth a look 
4642,4,Not dramatic as Hong Kong but hiking to this tower is worth it with the great view of the city Night view is really nice
4643,5,My husband and I went to the tower and it was such a great experience We walked up the tower which I dont recommend if you are not up for the challenge and we had lunch at the Italian restaurant at the top After lunch which was delicious we placed a love lock on the fence and took pictures We then went to the tower and stayed up there for about 30 minutes It has such a great view and it was also romantic
4644,5,Because of its location on a hill you can actually appreciate the scale of this enormous city At about 20 million you really cant quite grasp how large it is from any other location The area around the tower is quite pleasant and park like You can even see portions of the old city wall  As an added bonus if you are male be sure to check out the urinals in the mens washroom They are not usually noted for their views but these ones are a spectacular exception Try not to get stage fright  The prices are quite reasonable
4645,5,From Myeongdong Station it will be around 1520minutes hike to the lower cable car station If youre lazy to hike you may simply take a cab to the cable car station and itll be just a short stair hike upon arriving on the upper station Hiking to this tower is worth it with the great view of the city Youll also get a chance to see free cultural shows where they do sword dancing and other traditional stuff For lovers you may want to join the rest in placing padlocks around the area or for family with kids you may checkout their version of trick eye museum
4646,5,This is a must see attraction when you visit Seoul It is also were you can bring your padlocks and put it in the lovepadlock wall Even if you do not go the viewing deck you will witness the breathtaking view of Seoul I cant wait to go back here and see it at night Place is super clean even the restrooms are wellmaintained There are also food stalls and souvenirs shops
4647,3,We went there in the morning Up the tower is fun as you look up to ceiling of elevator to see a small show The tower give you a bird eye view of the city However smog was there in the morning and I guess it would be better to go later until they are gone I would definitely go in the evening as the neon light look much better for photograph
4648,5,I went to N Seoul Tower three times And each time was different but great The love locks are great The view is nice If you choose to the walk up is niceand steep The food is overpriced But what I love most is that there is always a new event happening up there  I went first August 2012 It was nighttime The lights were beautiful The second I went was around Chuseok September 2012 A bit quieter since it was around the holidays but they had traditional crafts and such The third time I went was January 2013 It was freeezing but there was so much to do There was jump roping traditional games street artists bandsit was amazing  If youre in Seoul you have to come to N Seoul Tower Enjoy the festivities that await you There is a lovely italian spot and cartoon museum on the walk back down too
4649,4,Excellent way to get a good look at almost the whole Seoul The area where you can buy a lock and write something on top of it then LOCK it as a spot you like Ideally bring a lock when you visit the place  It will save you some money
4650,4,Ive been here twice now and both times were great Amazing views of the city Went both at night and during the day and both times were equally as good At night the lights are beautiful but you see a lot more details during the day I also hiked up once and took the cable car once The hike isnt that but we hiked because the line for the cable car was insanity long If theres no line take the car Its just a little bit nicer Also if you want to do a love lock I would recommend you bring one with one They sell them at the tower but for 10x the price Overall a must on a tour of Seoul
4651,4,We took in a half day city tour that included the Seoul Tower It was great to see how spread out Seoul is and how it is surrounded by mountains Lots of young people place locks on the special trees near the tower entrance Its about of a steep walk up to the tower but its worth the effort
4652,5,I went to the The N Seoul Tower with the simple intention of viewing the urban sprawl from the observation deck above but it was its famous collection of love locks below that roused my senses the most  Id read about the locks in my guidebook but it simply described the sight as being trees covered with padlocks which symbolise eternal love I knew to expect a few of these trees but much to my surprise I was greeted with an entire kaleidoscopic fence full of padlocks key rings phone cases tags hearts and toys  there was such an array of dazzling paraphernalia attached to the railings  I spent nearly an hour taking in the sight before me reading through the many names  notes appearing on the locks Some of the messages were concise  to the point; others had a lifetime of thought  emotion put into them; all amounted to an astonishing display of collective happiness in the form of symbolic expression  As for the view from the top of the tower Well it was pretty neat but a little too smoggy to be considered spectacular The monochrome picture from the heavens didnt quite match the vividity of the scene below  Promise me you visit the love locks if you ever find yourself at N Seoul Tower  Perhaps you can even fasten one to the fence yourself
4653,4,its kinda hilly to get to the top but i loved it here Very romantic place there were a lot couple hung out at the N Cafe Definitely a must visit if you are in Seoul It is located in the centre of the city
4654,4,Please do go for a visit in the evening and its amazing to the whole city with lights glowing all over
4655,3,Its a long way from Seoul30 mins and its not worth the travel as its so crowed up there and extra admission fee needed to enter the tower
4656,3,Might be better to stay down the base of the tower rather than climb to the top which is expensive  nice to view the tower from far as well though
4657,5,Great place to site see Theres two ways of getting to the tower one is taking a cable car which cost about 6000 won 6 per person And the other way is going up stairs takes quite a while They also have tourist stores there and a restaurant place
4658,2,At first it took for us 4 hours get to the top from a metro station On the top is very crowdy Also you cannot take pictures at night because lights of the shops are mirrored in wibdows There is also no place to sit The view is similar to other towers in the world
4659,4,Only 8500 for the cable car and 9000 for the tower it is good value for a few hours Cable car gets ok views but they crowd a lot of people in so difficult to get a good view Top of the tower there are great views on a clear day Good coffee at the top as well The love padlocks on the fences are an interesting sight as well
4660,5,The tower is beautifully lit at night From the top the view of Seoul and the areas surrounding the city is breathtaking Can be rather chilly at night Constant stream of visitors even at night
4661,5,This is a must do in Seoul The view gives you a panoramic view of the immensity of this city The atmosphere is really fun and kids love it
4662,4,We took a shuttle bus from Seoul to the tower and by the time we reach there it is about 6pm It was just a short queue to go up to the tower when we visited but it is quite packed at the top; at the observatory deck The view of Seoul from the top is beautiful after the sun sets
4663,4,If you like hasslefree way to go to N Seoul Tower you may take Seoul city tour bus take the morning tour as I went on night tour too but the bus only stop there for bout 5 minutes but it might take awhile before you arrive as this place is the 16th or 17th stop for the bus tour if Im not mistaken You may also take a bus or cable car to go there  If you take a bus you will have to walk uphill bout 10 minutes depends Other attractions nearby such as Alive Museum and famous lovelocks place are worth visiting if you have extra time to spend Youll have to buy the ticket before proceeds to observation deck  Basic costs Heart lovelock set KRW12000 split two with my friend so KRW6000 each Seoul morning tour bus KRW10000 you may hop in and off at most Seouls attractions until 7 pm Admission ticket for adult approx KRW15000 observatory deck  Alive Museum Sending postcard from observation deck approx KRW1000 with stamp  Its such a nice place for photo sessions despite it was really windy when we went there The lovelock thing is so fun to do and the view of Seoul from observation deck is just mesmerizing I heard it is much fun at night but I prefer morning as the view is clearer Nothing to brag bout Alive Museum just skip it if you dislike taking pictures You need to come here if youre in Seoul the air the nature is amazing
4664,5,You could get there by bus walking or by cable car Probably cable car is the best way up and to get down you could just walk about 15 minutes At the bottom they have nice cafes and couple so called museums View from the tower is great especially at evening So its better to go there at the end of the day get a cup of coffee and enjoy views of night Seoul Seoul is beautiful even from the bottom of the tower the tower itself located the top of central mountain or big hill in Seoul and I believe that its not necessary to pay extra to go up the tower
4665,4,Had to make this trip to N Seoul Tower during a business trip on a winter night 10 deg and during a winter sunny day 1 deg great view of the city from here specially at night
4666,4,I visited with my husband who had previously visited in day time The views from the top as darkness fell on a rather misty evening were amazing more and more things were lit up as we watched It is quite difficult to take good pictures as there are windows and brightly lit shops inside which reflect If you want a quieter view go to the level below where the lift leaves from There are now so many lock trees and railings at the top They have multiplied tremendously since my husband was last here a few years ago
4667,4,Namsan Tower is a great place to spend an afternoon in any season Walking up from the base is excellent exercise and the views are equally rewarding A mustsee in Seoul
4668,4,High place in Seoul You can go there by bus or metro Beautiful view from the top I visit korea twice and also always go there to enjoy beautiful view from seoul tower Night view is more beautiful but you will get trouble to use cable car there So dark surround full with high trees Recommend to come there at afternoon
4669,5,Beautiful tower on top of the mountain overlooking Seoul Go at the end of the day so you see it during daylight and also at night
4670,4,Visible from anywhere in Seoul even locals frequent NSeoul tower Various ways to get there include bus taxi cable car or highly recommended for the fit any of the beautiful pathways up the mountain itself You can ascend the tower if you want but if the ticket queues are long just enjoy the free view Theres plenty to eat including a super burger joint or something more traditional if you prefer and an ice creamery to die for Add a lovelock with your partner to the wall of other peoples passions then stay and watch the lightshow on the tower at night before ambling down past bits of old and some rebuilt fortress walls
4671,3,The place was great both during day and night we went up to the tower but was not really impressed The view from hill where the tower is located is already good enough We bought a combo ticket for both teddy bear museum and the tower I was not impressed with the teddy bear museum as well Overall it is worth visiting but not necessarily need to go up the tower
4672,4,The journey to the top is better if you take the stairs against the road The view is magnificent once you get to the top Once at the top ride the cable cart down for a small fee
4673,3,The view up there is nice but there is nothing really interesting Because from one can already see the view of the city from the foot of the tower The deck is filled with people which makes it quite squeezy Not really worth the 9000won for the observatory deck
4674,5,It was snowing when we reached Extremely cold so be prepared and dress warm Not to be missed Love the birds eve view from the tower down to the city
4675,5,Great view I went with a friend not knowing what to expect We walked to the tower and were tired but all in all the trip was worth it Id go on non holidays or days which would be lees busy if at all possible
4676,5,Nice place good view on the night city andtoo many people who want be there Hour of waiting 10 min at the top and long way down
4677,5,i walked up from myeongdong station and did not know there is elevator from station to cable car station catch some information about this elevator where exit you should go to find this elevator and you dont need walked up the hill this is really exhausting we catch the cable car around 45 pm and there is short queue after you arrived at namsan tower cable car u need to walk some stairs to find the locket which sell ticket for observartory dinner at observatory and teddy bear museum but i heard this museum already been closed love lock place and souvenir shop if you forget to bring your lock just stop by at souvenir shop
4678,5,Spectacular views of Seoul from Seoul Tower The ride there on the cable car was fun too We got to see a great sunset from the cable car on the way down And a Cold Stone Creamery was a nice treat when you get up to the mountain at the base of the tower We didnt eat at the revolving restaurant this time around because its a bit pricey and we had already overspent our budget but I want to next time I m sure itll be quite a treat Next time we hope to add our lock to the millions already there
4679,5,amazing view from the top would do it again Had no idea it was going to be that long of a hike though It is not for the faint at heart and those out of shape need to make sure they take plenty of breaks and bring water We went at night its really dark on some parts so consider that BUt when you get to the top there is entertainment a couple of restaurants and then at the top of the tower there is a wishing station and the view is AWESOME we took the sky train down which i knew they had that before i struggeled up Id do it again though
4680,5,You dont realize how big Seoul is until you experience this Very cool  Short cable car ride to base of tower then another ticket to elevator to top No way you should miss the top 360 degree view  Lots of food vendors restaurants etc Is first thing you should do when visiting Seoul to grasp just how big the city is  Worth it for the view alone We went during day but I heard view of city at night even more stunning
4681,4,I walked all the way up the hill taking 2 stops and enjoying city views at different points and also greenery around Once up i went up the tower but it was very crowdy due to saturday I enjoyed cold fountain at the base of tower after long walk up the hill
4682,4,a visit at night gives color perspective  the best way is by cable car be prepared for a wait to board car or tower worth a visit
4683,5,We did not take the cable car or walk up as many people do Instead  from Myeodong Station go out exit 4 and catch bus 5 This does a loop and stops at Seoul Tower Namsan It may not be as spectacular as the cable but as we were a family of 4 it was definitely MUCH cheaper and faster than walking Take into consideration the traffic in the late afternoon as the bus does take over 30 minutes to get up there We were hoping to arrive to watch the sunset but made it a little after but the sky over the city was still brilliant Try to go on a clear day as the visibility will obviously be betterThere are plenty of photo opportunities just as you get off the bus and many more as you walk up to the entrance of the tower There are great views from on top of the hill and if you are on a budget that may be enough However I recommend the 360 view from the observatory at the top of the tower as it is stunning Even the bathrooms have amazing viewsCaught the 5 bus back to Myeodong Station on the way down which did not take that long Definitely need to come here when visiting Seoul
4684,3,I walked up the hill at night and had to wait an hour to go up to the observation deck During that time I walked around outside and quickly realized that the attraction isnt the observation deck Its the views from the terraces at the top and the sights seen on the walk up Save your money and get some exercise
4685,4,We visited read directions from their website Used exit 9 but could not see were the shuttle bus would pick us up We waited for a bit asked some passers by and decided to take a taxi We were dropped off at cable cars Took this up to near the base of the tower and back could have done just up and walked down Not sure show people with strollers or wheelchairs would navigate this attraction View was good Mostly clear so we could see for a distance When we went back down we took an elevator to ground level then were able to walk on the street towards subway to continue our day
4686,5,This was my first real tower experience anywhere in the world It was cold WARNING there are no cars that take you directly to the tower They will drop you off at one point and you must walk up a very steep road a few hundred feet Rarely will taxis take you there The buses are cheap but the wait for a bus back can be very cold if in winter the lookout itself before the tower is breathtaking But the tower is beautiful inside and it offers a couple different levels and a restaurant pretty expensive The souvenirs are cheap tho Definitely a sight to see
4687,4,This is a small place but a lot of activities There is the N Tower for a view of the city there is also a viewing deck with the Love locks cable car Teddy Bear Museum 5 restaurantscafes park
4688,5,I went there 2 times During day time with the tour and at night using shuttle bus together with my friend During the day it was full of fog so we couldnt go into the tower because we cant see anything there So we only do sight seeing around the padlocks and cafe Its too crowded and we couldnt enjoy it too may people coming from different country and culture The climb although challenging provides great view of the Namsan mountain and Seoul For the faintlegged the cable car is convenient  Most of the padlocks already became rusty and dirty and some of it under renovation for cleaning purpose Only on the top floor we could see the padlocks  The view at night was totally different The view is perfect for couples Do make a visit to this place  its such a romantic place filled with a scenery you will never forget 
4689,3,It has a great view over parts of Seoul and us well worth a visit on a clear day  Near the tower they have padlock fenced lookouts They have stolen the idea from the padlock on Pont de lArcheveche in Paris But of course there is no Seine to drop your key into I thought Paris was tacky but this of course is ten times more so Still it seems popular enough
4690,4,Make sure you go up on a clear day you get really nice 360 views of Seoul and surrounding mountains Definitely worth going up when visiting Seoul The surrounding Namsan Park is also nice especially when the cherry blossom and other flowers are out You can start your walk from Namsangol Hanok Village and walk all the way up provided you like long walks
4691,3,We went there in the evening thinking that there was a light show There wasnt It was nice to see how Seoul looks in the evening with the patterns of light along the walls and river Its better to go during the day though
4692,3,One of the most recognizable features from anywhere in Seoul the N Seoul Tower is large a communication and observation tower At the base youll find a small marker to denote that it is the geographical center of Seoul There is a fee to access the observatory of the tower 9000 KRW The Locks of Love area is interesting to visit Great a nice day but expect crowds
4693,4,Lots of people and very crowded The view from the top of the tower was very nice and beautiful You cant miss this place out when in Seoul  Advise Go during the day was just OK Go during the night was splendid The Love Lock is a place to take photo there part of it is under construction The best is to stay there from evening till the night view
4694,5,I went to N Seoul Tower on my own at night Steep climb but I find it all worth the effort Pick a non foggy day to visit this place at night the entire Seoul city light up before your eyes and it was quite a superb view Bare in mind its certainly not suitable for the elderly as they need to climb the steep hill to reach the cable car station From MyeongDong MD that the exit 3 from the sabway station and you will reach the front of pacific hotel keep walking up the hill and keep to your right The line at the cable car station was long when I was there cant imagine how long I have to wait if I came during the day Reach the summit then another queue for the observatory level and need to purchase separate ticket While all the tourists all pack at the observatory level you could go to one level down as if you were leaving there are less people there which you could take better photos
4695,4,was staying at the grand Hyatt went for an early morning walk and walked up the hill to the tower Its pretty touristy once you get up here but its worth it for the view Take your camera 
4696,5,The view from this tower is simply SPECTACULAR You cant miss this place out Your S Korea tour will not be completed if you dont visit this place 
4697,2,Tho it is a must to place to go if you are 1st timer to Seoul but sorry to say there is really nothing interesting there unless you wanna visit the art museum no more teddy bear museum which is the same as trickeye museum  Unfortunately for me there isnt much scenery for me to see as it was too foggy also there were soo many people up there where you dont really have a chance to take a good picture plus the most important area which is the edge where u see the scenery is under renovation
4698,4,we were here at the early of april and luckily we could see the cherry blossom next to the tower area
4699,4,Went at night around 8pm it was still crowded with long queue for the tram up and back down The scenery is really nice with the city lights and tower in the back
4700,4,This is the heighest place of Seoul city You can have two views here Day view You can see the entire Seoul city from this tower Night View It is more beautiful than the Day view Entire city will be illuminated with lights  There are two ways to reached here 1 You have to clibm the hill 2 You can take a cable car waiting for an hr in weekends and need to pay a fee  One more interesting thing here is LOCKS Entire place is filled with lock Here you can lock your love Couples are coming and locking there love here
4701,2,Its boring to visit Not much to see during daytime its just a view from top looking at buildings and mountains around the tower There were stalls in the tower selling souvenirs of the Nseoul tower The food at the bottom of the tower was good though
4702,2,Theres really not much to see in the daytime because of the foggy view Also the observation deck is enclosed unlike Victoria peak in Hong Kong where you can idle around and enjoy the breeze and view The price of the observation deck is not worth it If you insist on going you may want to take the bus no 05 instead of the cable car Its much cheaper Also when you get there go straight to the ticket office downstairs Dont bother with the combo packages
4703,3,1 If youre traveling with kids or oldies or just anyone whos not fit take the cable car because the very steep hike is just horrible  2 Its a tower with an eclectic elevator aims to make you feel like youre being shot to the skies Go at night if youre going because of the view  3 My favorite was the lock garden Just because its corny and quirky and colorful I dont mind that this was a paris knock off haha
4704,3,This is my 2nd time to visit the Tower On my first visit I took the Cable Car going up This time we took the bus and it was a huge mistake The bus will drop you off at the bottom of the Tower and theres a 10 minute hike uphill If you are traveling with kids old folks  people with cardiac problems I suggest you take the Cable car going up
4705,3,The N Seoul Tower is like any other high point city towerbut if you are in Seoul I would recommend going We visited the tower in the evening on a Friday night so it was full of teenage couples searching for a romantic spotso plan accordingly We were fortunate to see Seoul during daylight on the way up and then stuck around until sundown to go back down  I would recommend doing the same but be prepared for a crowd We walked from Myeong dong to the cable car office which was much more of a walk than we anticipated so I recommend cabbing it to save energy
4706,3,Offering probably the best views in Seoul the N Soul Tower is worth a visit That said you should also be aware that on top of being one of the most visited spot by the tourists the tower is amazingly popular among the local people According to our own experience if the queue to the cable car starts from the street it will take couple of hours to reach the top including the wait for the tower elevator So avoid the weekends if you can
4707,2,Go on a clear night and youll get a decent view of the Han River and Seoul Keep your expectations low and be prepared to pay too much and endure crowds and long waiting times going up and back down though
4708,3,or trap You can walk or ride the bus to the top The bus was full so we walked it took around 20 minutes to reach the tower The lookout points had spectacular views and werent crowded at all If only the same was true for the tower The tower itself is packed with people of all internationalities There is a variety of food spots as well as places to buy souvenirs The lines are long but move fast But Its something you do once though I would suggest walking to the top if possible It will make for a better experience
4709,3,We went to N Seoul Tower on a Saturday night and it was packed They had a queueing system according to the time you bought the tickets to board the lift It was very poorly managed with only 1 staff at the entrance which resulted in many visitors going in when the staff is occupied We waited for nearly 50 mins before we were able to board the elevator up We were there at night and the view was alright Having been to other attractions such as Marina Bay Sands  Taipei 101 the view was pretty disappointing as compared to them We thought the worst of the queueing was over but we still had to queue to get down to the main lobby Needless to say we spent the majority of our time waiting in line and it wasnt a pleasant experience So go only to check it off your travel list of places to visit in Seoul
4710,3,The night view was nice but it was super crowded as we went during weekend The queue for the cable car was crazy long and it took us about 25 hours to get to the observatory deck Do drop by the love lock bridge if you are traveling with your special one 
4711,4,this place is for lovers yes but the city view is great from this spot so it is still worth visiting even when youre single like me bring your friends with you though like i did so you wont reach your bitterness capacity lol anyway to the facts  youd need to ride a cable car to get to the tower Price is 6k won one way 8k won return and 85k won roundtrip the cable car ride is not that long and when you are stuck in the middle when the car is full you wont be able to take any photo its not needed though because the view up is way better so you dont have to feel bad if you dont want to take the cable car you can trek using the stairs going up view inside the tower and outside is just the same but if you like to enter the tower there is a separate fee that you need to pay 9k won My advice dont enter the tower anymore its cramped with people and the view is just the same there are restaurants and cafes in the area price range from 8k won for coffee americano and pancake best to go here before sunset so you get to experience the view with daylight and diamond like little lights of the city at night going back they said there is a bus that you can take but we didnt see it that time so we needed to take the cab Cab fee is fixed from that place orange cab is 20k won and black cab is 30k won not sure how far they can take you but we were headed to myeong dong and that was the rate
4712,4,The tower is like any other asian tower with great views I think its worth going to just to see the vast size of the City Plan on spending about an hour for the visit then go back down and hit the city
4713,3,to get there the bus and other car will stop 500 meter from the tower  and u walk and climb very highso dont use highheel   dont forget to bring padlock  named it with your name an your partner so the love is everlasting
4714,5,Its really nice to go there at night and see the teddy bear museum and even check out the love locks The lights look awesome too We took the Namsan Cable Car going there which is just a walking distance from Myeongdong
4715,3,I do love a sky tower but this experience wasnt the best From a distance N Seoul Tower stands tall and chic Our experience was far from chic Queued for about 15 hours before even making the cable car flight in a waiting room crammed full of tourists and little ventilation The room was filthy with people dropping their trash all over the place and noone cleaning it up Not ideal but we dealt  When we eventually made it to the tower foyer and the top of the hill we were presented with a further wait whilst we waited our turn to ascend the tower itself  After our expedition to the top we were quite disappointed The windows were really dirty which made photographs and the general view pretty poor There were no outside viewing areas and they really pile the punters into this tower so theres very little room for manoeuvre Theres also a picknmix candy store which is just absolutely ridiculous  Probably worth a visit if youre in the area but you should try to go early in the day to avoid the crazy queues
4716,5,Its best to go just before sunset You get an amazing 360 degree view of Seoul during daylight then as the sun sets you can watch Seoul light up at night It really looks like a completely different city from day to night
4717,5,was such a beautiful place in winterplenty to eat therebut a pity that the teddy bear museum has closed downtheres also cultural show at selected time and a small corner with cultural costumes for you to wear to take pics inFOCbut the stairs leading to the tower will be abit tedious for those with knee problem 
4718,3,This was my second visit to Seoul tower and the first was by far superior It was quite smoggy this visit which greatly limited the view of the city Truly I think you gain just as much an idea of the expanse of Seoul from the observation at the base of the tower as you do from paying the 9000 Won to go up the tower I find the tower crowded and more of a souvenir shop than anything else Still it is a fun visit just wait for a clear day
4719,5,Good busgondola access to the tower Distinct lack of tat but a genuinely interesting area Excellent views and illustrated panoramic landmarks clearly shown Small coffee shop provided a drink stool and a chance to soak up the views
4720,3,Its a tower you can see quite how spread out Seoul is theres a cable car not much else to say really
4721,4,We used the cable car to get up and then payed for entry for the tower as well Its good to go later in the day as daylight turns to dark That way you get to see Seoul in 2 different ways
4722,5,Obviously the troy has great views but the windows are so dirty it is hard to see out Still a great place and it is amazing how big a city Seoul is The views really show how great the city and massive the city is
4723,4,This is a very fun place for everyone Lots of activities going on restaurants and of course going up the tower and looking at the beautiful city There is a tram but you can also hike to the tower
4724,5,Nice if you want to pay for a dinner at the french restaurant To sit and look over the town when it goes around
4725,5,nice walk up but much easier to catch 3 bus Itaewon was my access Great views as you would expect of any tall perch I did not eat in the restaurant look elsewhere for reviews there Twenty minutes is plenty at the top the walk from the bus stop to the elevators is tough on bad legs dont bother as it will only hurt you If you are able to walk a couple of hundred yards up to the elevators it is great Spring or fall would be spectacular as Korea has so many beautiful trees We were in the dead of winter and still enjoyed the view
4726,3,We enjoy the walk up to the place and taking photographs around the area The view in the tower benches and trees full of locks are the main attraction Good time to go before sunset to walk around take photos and watch the sunset
4727,5,We used the tram to reach the tower and it was the wrap of my visit to Seoul I could see the old and the new seoul at the same time Theres a place for couples to put their gridlocks representing their longlasting love Too bad i wasnt travelling with my couple 
4728,4,Unless you are looking for a workout take a bus up to the tower and enjoy a leisurely walk back down Its worth the trip and price for the view
4729,5,If you have some spare cash why not pay a little more for a unique dining experience up there Pay about a 43000won for dinner with entry to the tower The restaurant Hancook is just great Well the ambiance and the staff is there but the atmosphere was soso because I chose the wrong day to visit the tower Be sure to check your weather reports before deciding to pay that 43000won What you want is to dine in style and literally look down at Seoul underneath you and see the city landscape at night But thanks to the fog that shrouded Mt Namsan all I see are clouds drifting by Overall the tower is a must go as seen in movies and if you are travelling couple be sure to lock your love on the fences and throw the keys into Seoul  As for transport we took a yellow bus and its roughly about 2030 minutes Very comfy and the same bus back down to Myeongdong  Recommended length of visit with dinner  more than 3 hours
4730,3,Its akin to all typical towers that offers a birds eye view of the city Night lights are beautiful but during the day the view is not as great no thanks to the polluted airenvironment I would recommend couples making a trip up to bring your own locks and buying a set from the gift shop is terribly expensive
4731,5,We visited the tower while we were living in Seoul and it was one of my favorite things we had done in the city The views are just amazing you can see how huge Seoul really is and if you know the areas you can point out other places you have been If you are just visiting the city this is a must see stop of your tour
4732,5,I think you wont ever forget it Views of the city and its hiils are wonderful and bright The cable car is availbale however bear in mind that queues may be enormous after 8pm Didnt try the restaurant on the top but the cafe was ok
4733,5,we took a short and inexpensive taxi ride from our hotel Sutton and really enjoyed our time here had a nice lunch and the views were terrific
4734,4,Its a tourist trap but its worth seeing at least once Id recommend going for the sunset and its probably most beautiful in autumn The view of Seoul is quite incredible you wouldnt believe form up there you cant even see the end of the city Id recommend walking through namsan Park if you can and are willing to its quite a bit of exercise Otherwise just go there once enjoy the view as much as you can its worthwhile one time Cheers 
4735,4,Its one of those mustvisit touristy spot but its alright to pay a little for the entrance and get to experience the romance in the air and the breathtaking view of Seoul from the tower  I took a bus up and hiked down the Namsan Hill but you could always take the cable car which is a waste of money in my opinion The journey down the hill is beautiful and at the same time I got some kind of exercise too The view from the observation tower is gorgeous and the fence of locks is for the diehard romantic Couples would seal their loves with locks and ditch the away the keys  I was there in the day but at night the tower would lit up and it looked pretty awesome from Myeongdong when I was doing my shopping that evening
4736,4,Yes a total tourist trap but the kind that is worth the trip We took the bus up which was maybe 10 and then hiked to the tower Its a ridiculously steep incline so not for the lazy but the journey is beautiful and good exercise The view is gorgeous and wildlife is present We saw a pheasant right next to the fence This is ideal for couples very romantic and the fence of locks is inspiring People seal there love with a lock and throw the key away We went during the say but at night would be overwhelmingly romantic Historically significant No but enjoyable and really puts the size of Seoul into perspective
4737,3,So an earlier review said this was better for couples and most reviews were positive but having gone based on these reviews I felt disappointed at the end The area is clean and the views are nice and we certainly enjoyed the long walk their from our hotel Inside however you are hit by the candy sweet smell of popcorn while queueing for your ticket Their are different options available and since we were there at lunch we opted for the couples package which included trips to the viewing deck for two people despite the board saying one person only and lunch in their Italian restaurant Once inside the lift you are told to look up where on the lift ceiling they play a techno high speed video that you cant focus on and if anything made us both feel weird as the elevator was ascending Then once inside the place is full of pick and mix sweets and crap for kids How someone has suggested that the attraction was suited to couples is beyond me The restaurant was the biggest let down We were greeted and seated in an awful spot with a huge vent blocking the view the restaurant was 99 empty at the time Then with virtually no English unlike most people we met in Korea who speak quite good English we were offered only two pasta plates carbonara or arrabiato neither of which we wanted This was also to share  NOT a plate each This hugely limited choice given such a varied menu was never indicated at the ticket office It also did not include any drinks which you guessed it cost the earth compared to normal places The food when it arrived was then totally different We had a smoked salmon salad which may have been nice be it for the gallon of dressing covering everything  the pasta was well cooked but ruined by streaky bacon and also a margarita pizza was served but the base was literally thinner than a crepe  The views from the base surrounding the tower are just as good as inside I would recommend the walk and to visit the various viewing points The tower its self is very average and i certainly would not be conned into a meal package as conned is how we felt
4738,4,From our hotel Plaza we walked to the cable car area and took teh cable car to the top nice area to overlook the city and then go into the Tower for a better view There are some restaurants and sovernir shops as well You can also walk to the Tower area instead of taking the cable car
4739,5,the weather was not the best and we decided to have lunch with spectacular view in the tower It waas relaxing and the food was great
4740,4,Namsan Tower is lovely True it is flocked by lovers who would seal their love forever through cute padlocks but for me its more of a family venue All types of people with all kinds of relationship can also enjoy this tour We took the cable car to go up You may buy one way or round trip tickets We did one way ticket paid 6K won The line queueing is only 5 mins So its not true that youll have to wait 45mins To 1 hour to get to the top It depends if the season is peak or lean saw the Teddy bear museum Not so awesome but teddybear lovers would appreciate it You can take bus going down its free but we took the steps and the view is spectacular Make sure to gear on your winter attire coz youll definitely feel the chill up there
4741,4,This is landmark of Seoul Id say Ive been many other tower all around the world But NSeoul tower has something special thing I recommend you to go there at night if you are considering to go One thing that I dont like is its not that easy to access unless you are with local travel agency Using public transportation is one good option or you can take cable car to get the top
4742,3,The climb although challenging provides great view of the Namsan mountain and Seoul For the faintlegged the cable car is convenient The observatory indeed gives a great aerial view of Seoul and its surrounding but the glass was dirty so we couldnt get proper photos It didnt do the entrance fee justice Watch lovebirds young and old men and women of any age be all loveydovey taking photos with Kdrama inspired poses and locking a lovepadlock I bet during peak season this place would be hell and you wont be able to enjoy the view at all
4743,5,Up there in the zero degrees is not an excuse not to enjoy the view as one of the famous landmark here in Seoul its really worth to check out for the splendid view of the city the Han River and just the couple sharing promises word and lock their love its just awesome It is also easy to go up there either by bus or cable car with free shuttle thr from the subway station  The view is spectacular at night more so during sunset so plan you trip there really well to catch the fantastic view from up thr 
4744,3,better to use cable car compared to other methods If by walking will be tiring and once you reach the top the scenery is awesome
4745,5,Love it when winter many christmas tree made of love logs so many couple logs their love there You may take the cable car to go up there recommended
4746,4,Should experience once to be at the top of tower was so anticipated to take a look on the view of Seoul from the top but the weather during September was rainy and cloudy all I can see is just fog  So disappointed But at least the Teddy Bear Museum was quite a good experience
4747,5,Take a bus up the mountain then walk ten minutes and youll find yourself so far away from any of the hustle and bustle of the city you knew Its a little strange at first but incredible to see all the lights of the city sparkle and an eerie calm Definitely do this when you need some relaxation from the world
4748,4,we went last winter in 2013 during sunset and this place was super crowded3 but the view from the tower was amazing it also looked stunning at night with all the lights  a must go 
4749,4,Good place to view the sunset Youd be able to see the entire city from up here Tends to get crowded at certain time of the day And as usual it would be challenging to get a good photo inside the tower as sunlight glare was a bit intense Theres the usual souvenir shop cafe and highest postbox in South Korea Couples could also profess their love on the unique love tiles on sale If youre lucky you might also be able see cultural shows at the base of the tower We were lucky to watch a martial art and a dance show there Easily spent 2 hours here
4750,4,The view from the Ntower is very beautifulWe can see the city from here we can take a picture using the traditional Korea dress and taking picture at the loves lock is also good memory
4751,3,It is a nice place but too cold to romance Very crowded with people You cant clearly see the city in winter time Good for couples experiencing there Very good place
4752,5,Its a must go place in Seoul especially when traveling with your the other half You will able to have a great view of Seoul City from there
4753,3,While the tower does offer great views of the city the winds are so dirty it almost impossible to get a decent picture  The surprise was the love locks on the observation deck at the base of the tower 1000s of locks on the fence Apparently started from a TV show that filmed a scene up there Certainly unique and something not to miss if you are up there
4754,5,The N tower or the Namsang tower acts as the face of Seoul and no one misses on this place as one doesnt leave Eiffel tower from a Paris itinerary N tower is an attraction in every term as it rises high in the sky giving a view so spectacular from a distance itself that you cant help yourself from going to the place The passes you buy for the tower also includes to the top level access from where you can catch an amazing view of Seoul and along with that they have a very good museum that has display of Teddy bear in every sizes and forms and is rightfully names the Teddy bear museum and another thing that you wont be able to miss around here is the huge piles of locks that represents locking of love and there are trees actually made from these locks and actually gives you a spectacular view
4755,4,Must see tower with great view of Seoul Considered as one of the landmarks of Seoul with teddy bear museum on the ground floor Cafes and souvenir shops They also have fine dinning resto on the top most tower You can choose to go down via cable car or simply walk
4756,4,I took a long hike to the top from the bottom of the park across the street from the Hilton Although at first look it appeared to be very crowded there was space to move around at ease Tip buy your tickets to the tower inside the building There were lines outside but no lines at all inside The observation deck views were amazing
4757,3,I guess this is a great place for couples with nice lighting and great view We went there at night so we managed to get a sight of the Seoul city night view We took a cable car which costs us 8000 won each which brought us to the tower We then get the normal observation deck ticket which costs us 9000 won each They even have a couple package ticket slightly costly but you get a popcorn and two drinks  Theres elevator which took us to the observation deck Its indeed a couple place other than the typical tourists group all you can see are local couples and couple travelers like us People will just sit by the window and talk and talk for the whole night Thats what we did  We even sent a postcard from the tower which is the highest post office in Seoul Haha I received the postcard in good order after two weeks So please feel free to send one too  Weve also secured a love lock near the ticketing counter I guess is a must do for couples If you do not want to purchase the lock from their souvenir shop feel free to bring one yourself Just like what we did Its quite fun browsing through the locks you get to see various type of shapes and messages Feel free to look for ours
4758,5,You get a great view of the entire Seoul from the observation deck Theres also cultural shows during the day  a must see and visit
4759,5,Pretty sunset view  We stay there still late to see the beautiful lighting for the tower as well The only problem is  the place is too cold
4760,4,Not too hard to find if you follow directions avail on many sites Take the cable car if you are not an avid hiker It is quite the climb up a pile of stairs I recommend dinner at one of the places just to have time to take the views The N Grill rotates and you can watch the whole city landscape as it rotates
4761,2,Polular place for couples yes and it is easy to see from the surrounding attractions  Pricey entrance fee and the only reason why I will visit again is the onion popcorn they sell and that is about it
4762,5,Right peeps get to Myeongdong station find the pacific hotel and walk all the way up the hill on the right hand side there is a cable car that takes you there This place is a couples paradise beautiful views of Seoul several restaurants Personally I would dodge the French one 88000won pp is just stupid nice gift shop limited but nice Two nice things for couples 1 Bring a lock and put it with hundreds of other locks and write something on the lock this is what me and the mrs did 2 love letter tile that you can put a message of you and your beloved with a photo of you two and put it on the 2 floor Overall I would say 2 hours is enough and go a night as the tower lights up beautifully
4763,4,N Seoul Tower is a unique place to visit while in Seoul Its very interesting it see Seoul from such a high spot Also an opportunity to put a lock of love or friendship to join the hundreds of thousands left by friends  lovers I dont like the high cost charged by the cable car to reach the site which is very short ride
4764,4,Basically there is nothing special about this place But there is a Teddy Bear museum here and I think if you are not be able to visit Jeju Island for original Teddy Bear museum this place is a great choice I dont really recommend going up N Seoul Tower because there is a place which is much nicer than N Seoul Tower and it is 63 Building Instead of N Seoul Tower I think 63 Building has a much nicer view to see especially night view However if you do have time try to visit both places and compare it yourself
4765,5,Climbing upward towards the tower was not very easy especially with the icy roads and snow all over the ground It was a very steep slope up from the bus stop to the tower as there is no vehicle allowed to travel to the door step of the park Hence old folks and young children will have a difficulty going up slope even if it is not winter time However the night scene up the Seoul tower is worth the travel Seeing all the Love locks was nice Go juz before Sunset so u can view day n nite view
4766,4,Visited mid afternoon on cold  sunny December day The area immediately surrounding the N Seoul Tower has several gift shops  cafes The Teddy Bear museum is closed for repairs The view from the observation deck is very good There are 2 decks More cafes  a gift shop can be found here View is good A pleasant family outing
4767,4,N Seoul Tower is very romantic places They got love lock attached to the railings around the tower  In my case I bring my own lock from home But there are store here which sell the lock inside the N Seoul tower  To get here you can choose by bus or by cable car Both can be really crowded I recommend that you took bus to get here and choose cable car to get home
4768,3,well  i was a bit un lucky for the day i visited there  it was raining and it was around 5C  so i cant see the view clearly plus getting wet with the cold rain  or other wise i am sure will enjoying there
4769,5,I must admit climbing upward towards the tower was not very easy especially with the icy roads and snow all over the ground It was a very steep slope up from the bus stop to the tower as there is no vehicle allowed to travel to the door step of the park Hence old folks and young children will have a difficulty going up slope even if it is not winter time However the night scene up the Seoul tower is worth the travel
4770,5,As a family we all really enjoyed the tower Although touristy its puts Seouls size and scope into perspective A 360 view high above the city scape We came here with our kids ages 4  6 they both enjoyed the tower  its views
4771,4,The cable car station can be a bit out of reach as the hike is pretty steep on some routes View at night might be better than view during the day but thats probably more of a personal opinion
4772,4,The tower in itself is a great place to go to It has several restaurants and eateries in the tower itself The view from the top is simply amazing
4773,5,N Seoul Tower or Namsan Tower offers some spectacular views of the city My favorite time to go is in the evening just before the sun is setting to see the city as the lights turn on
4774,3,Came here after our visit to Namsamgol Hanok Village There were a few direct city bus from the village to Mt Namsan From there a manageable steep accent to the tower I find the tickets way overpriced There is nothing much on top and it was overcrowded and noisy Apparently those who went up hang around with the steep price I can understand why and it was hard to properly enjoy the view I went there while the sun was setting and it was nice to see the sunset hues and then quickly turning dark it was winter time It was a good way to appreciate the city though  Seoul is really hugeand the roads are all glittering with cars stuck in the jam 
4775,5,This is the first place when we visited Seoul on April 2013 Its already spring at that time but the weather still freezing around 4 degrees celcius After put our luggage at Irene Hotel Namdaemun we went to N Seoul Tower by bus There are many ways to get there You can take either bus or just walk to the tower We start the trip at 7 PM we took a bus Blue bus no 406 from Namdaemun market and alight at Namsan tower tunnel 3 2 stops We walk accross the street throuh tunnel heading to Namsan Oreumi The elevator It located right beside the street and bring us to Namsan Cable car We buy ticket for round trip and it costs 8000 won Its a bit pricey When we arrived at N Seoul Tower we still have to walk through the stairs But it worth it The view of Seoul was great At the corner there is padlock tree We bought one at the souvenir store and lock it there Its memorable time since my wife really love Kdrama We also went to Teddy bear Museum which i think very interesting place My kids really like to see a lot of cute diorama We really love this place
4776,4,Ive been to a few towers such as the one in Taipei I think its different Some people comment on the view but lets be honest here the view is very subjective and also it depends on the city  Anyway the N Seoul Tower I went both at night and day time It really depends when you go I took the cable car at night around 8pm i didnt need to wait that long I think maybe around 1015mins time The cable car is a bit pricey i thought but its an experience and most tourist will never know until they took it Alternatively you can take the bus there at a much lower cost  I think one of the attractions was the safelock thing where many couples friends and family me included purchased a lock and lock there Of course some would say its not worth it and stuff like that but what I can tell you is that it really depends what your looking for For me i do it as an experience and memory so i think its worth it Even if you dont purchase a lock and lock it there its an experience to see how many people visited Seoul  Overall yes go and have a look and see what Seoul is from up high
4777,5,I went there at night and it was absolutely gorgeous I took the cable cart which was worth the money and gives you the preview of what youll see when you get to the top The lights of Seoul is amazing and breathtaking There are a few activities to do once you get to the top including a teddy bear museum great gift shop and restaurant Enjoy
4778,3,You have to take a fairly long hike to get to the entrance of the Seoul Tower There are packages you can avail with the entrance fee to the tower like bundling it with the Bear Museum  The trip to the tower is just ok for me We went there nighttime and the view of the city is just average Though they have a post office at the top and you can send a mail from the tallest post office in the world They have stores there that sells postcards souvenirs etc
4779,4,I cheated took the cable car which I do not recommend The waiting time was about one and a half hours way too much you could have easily climbed it in the mean time Up there at night a beautiful view over the hilly area nice lights from the city had a good view Then took the stairs down easy way careful when wet or icy many love locks on top amazing to see
4780,3,The tower itself is not at the same level as others through the Asian region we went to Shanghai Tower last week which was much better Saying that still worth a visit takes a few hours Definitely take the return cable car not much of a view but avoids the walk You do get charged for the cable car and then the tower entry seperate  Whilst the tower was ok would recommend the pancakes from the base level restaurant on the outer and add a milkshake from the burger restaurant Food was clearly the highlight of the trip  Cable car view is not great view from tower is good albeit we had a fairly foggy day  Would recommend allowing 2 hours for a visit but wouldnt make it a prioirity on a 2 or 3 day visit
4781,4,I went up and down through the trails to me it that made a great part of the enjoyable experience as you walk along some parts of the wall Once on the top there are restaurants and shops at the base and top of the tower and of course the rewarding view at the top of it I definitely recommend going up and down by foot taking the cable car seems boring to me besides when going down I observed the cable car doesnt get you all the way to the top
4782,5,I went here twice and still impressive with it the locks fo lovers to seal their love forever can be found here U can also enjoy the scenery of Seoul from the 360 degrees observation deck Dont forget to check the teddy bear museum too
4783,5,Reach there by tripadvisor Then continue to ask for direction from Subway burger staff The best experience with bus number 5 1000won per person cos the driver is lazy to give u back tje change of 50won I didnt reach the top as theres a long queue about 10pm i just shoot some photos at the view of the locks trees The ice cream selling there staring from Stone  their recommended flavor is amazing Must try those 
4784,3,I went there twice First time was in the morning Visited Teddy Bear Museum and The Tower Second time was at night around 6pm It took me half an hour walking from NS3 to the souvenir shop beside NSeoul Tower Beautiful light around Seoul Tower Many tourists came at night too Bought NSeoul Tower magnetic set 3 for only 1000won
4785,4,We went to the tower to enjoy sunset We stayed to watch the city transform into a colorful sea of lights There is no great place to have a cocktail and take in the sights but we made do with a cold beer at the food choice cafe and then went to another cafe to see the other side of the city
4786,4,Easy access to Namsan Tower via the cable car bus or elevator Best to visit the place in the evening where you can catch the sunrise Wide variety of dining options and theres a teddy bear museum as well  This is a popular spot for drama filming It is also a popular dating spot for couples as they will seal the love with love locks on the sidewalk After dinner you can take a stroll at the outdoor observatory where there are many good spots for photo taking and at the same time you can enjoy the awesome night view of Seouls city line
4787,4,Great views from the top Worth it to get a full view of this enormous city Save money by just walking round the different lookouts for similar but obstructed views of the different parts of the city Walk up for a more rewarding experience as Namsan is a nice forest park
4788,4,Autumn colours great Good opportunity to walk along old city wall and to take photos of traditional costumes in this setting you can also dress up for free if you wish Walls of love locks interesting to see and to read some of messages
4789,5,walked from myeongdong to the namsam oreumi elevator wasnt difficult to find then took the cable car to the base of the tower the changing of transportation was interesting for the kids  bought along locks from daiso for the kids otherwise you can buy a pair for 12000 at the gift shop  dun miss the waffles and blueberry pancakes at the N Terrace Cafe not cheap at 9000won and 5500won respectively but they are really really yummy
4790,4,We went to the N Seoul tower during our stay because we had read in the guide books that it is a must visit especially if you want catch some amazing views of the city It is worthwhile spending a couple of hours visiting this place since the views are indeed beautiful There are many different ways you can get to the Observation Platform and we walked from our hotel to the Oreumi glass elevator that took us to the cable car The Oreumi elevator is an outdoor elevator that is right in front of the Namsan Tunnel and takes you to the Cable Car The Cable car ride is not a long one and you have to hike quite a number of steps after you get dropped off by the cable car to get to the observation platform There is a burger place and a souvenir shop if you want to grab something to eat and get home some memento  I was pleasantly surprised to find a whole lot of love locks here With the coming Christmas season they had fashioned Christmas trees out of all of these locks and it looked beautiful each tree standing behind a heart bench Lots of couples sat on the benches and took pictures  It was an enjoyable couple of hours spent here
4791,5,I visited N tower 1st time I think you must take a photo from outside area is better The bus will park at the base of Namsan mountain And then everybody must walk to the top around 500 m On the top I recommend to buy a package ticket and prepare a key to show your lovely couple Dont forget to visit Teddy bear museum also So much Enjoy there
4792,5,I have been to Seoul  Namsan Tower several times and will go again In a small mountain park it is an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city but yet it gives a fantastic view of the city you are escaping
4793,5,It may be the weatherthe timebut overalla visit to korea without experiencing Namsan is lacking I was not able to go on my first Summer of 2012 visitbut i made sure i did Autumn of 2013 and Namsan did not disappoint me
4794,5,Visited this place the 2nd time The first was during winter 2 years ago This time i visited in Summer Some changes to the exhibits makes this place worth returning again and again  I would recommend buying the whole package where it includes the teddy bear museum Bring a fully charged camera and have fun creating lots of memories there  Have yet to visit this place at night though Both trips were during the day but the view and experience is worth the hike up to the namsan cable car
4795,5,I have visited Seoul Tower twice both times I walked from my house and had my dog with me I did not attempt to go inside with the dog The outside area is nice it offers great views of the city from both sides of the mountain Also the locks that couples leave on the fence at the base of the tower are a great attraction
4796,2,I thought that the fastest way and most efficient and economical way of going to N tower was via cable car I was wrong From the city we had to walk uphill and it was quite long just to reach the cable car docking station The fee of one way going up is 6000 won per person It brought us only up to a certain point then we had to walk steep uphill to reach the summit When we went there it was evening Since one of my passion is photography I brought along my tripod together with my camera gears Theres a fee again of 9000 won if you want to reach the observation deck where lots of shops were set up It was frustrating in a sense because it was not an open space So I had to take pictures through the glass where at some parts there are reflections On our way down it was a good thing we took the bus all the way to meongdong So I strongly suggest that taking the bus going up and down the N tower is the most efficient and cheaper way
4797,3,If u wanna see panormic view of seoul come here though climbing is very steep and our bus only gave us 15mins to enjoy this place we had fun taking some pics too crowded during our visit
4798,3,I found that the best pictuires I took was from outside of the tower i went there at night to have beautiful views and pictures Views ok pictures not so much as inside the tower you got all the reflections of the windows in your pictures
4799,4,The funicular up the hill is free The cable car is 90000 KW The elevator to the top of the observation tower is 10000 KW Make sure you walk around both free levels The elevator lets you off on the observation level After finishing there walk down the half dozen steps to the photo level More information on what you are looking at before the elevator ride down
4800,4,We hit the Gondola line just after dark and were glad we werent looking for a parking place The lineup for the gondola was long but the service is efficient and we were at the base of the tower in quick time The line for the Tower elevators was equally long and since they are smaller than the gondola cars it took a bit longer to get to the top There are distractions along the way with the teddy bear videos and photo ops to entertain you There was a bit of mist the night we were there but still the 360 degree view of the lights of Seoul was worth the experience
4801,4,When on the top of the tower you can have fantastic views of Seoul City from different directions whether these are marvelous architecture giant landscapes or even crawling traffic in a country of huge population density
4802,4,This tower has some great views of the city It was also a lot of fun to visit as I come from a city with the CN Tower so it was great to see another tower
4803,3,Free cable cart to main section is cute There are restaurants up there but you want to make sure it is a clear night for best viewing  The show projected on the tower is free and worth watching For best views be up at the tower around 5pm and viewing as the sunsets Have dinner afterwards
4804,3,A mustvisit because it is a landmark and people whove been to Seoul would most likely ask you if youve been there It offers a great view of the city and the surrounding mountains But it was really crowded when we were there The Teddy Bear Museum was cute I was touched with the millions i assume of couples and visitors who locked their love on the fences and the sculptures
4805,4,There is very good laser show at N Seoul Tower  You get very good view of Seoul from viewers gallery  Lift is fast  Very good photographs taken by photographer although expensive  There should be more photographers so that there is choice to customer  Overall good experience and should visit when in Seoul 
4806,4,We went there in the late afternoon The view of the city from the mountain and the tower is very nice The trees are also very beautiful Much to my regret we were not able to go there at night The view must have been spectacular Dont skip this attraction
4807,2,We spent about 2 hours queueing cable car  tower and by the time we got to the top we were already tired and spent a mere 10 minutes at the observation decklevel The view was spectacular but definitely c Be sure to go on a weeknight or weekday we went on a Saturday night which was perhaps the reason for the long queue
4808,5,Well worth the visit Take the elevator all the way to the top it is so fast it reaches the top in a few seconds and inside the elevator you can see a picture of the tower  you can take pictures on the way up Once at the top the view is amazing  Lots of restaurants and shops
4809,5,we tried to walk up to Namsan Tower from Namsan Park but seems to be quite far and cant really find the way up Met a kind Uncle who brought us to a bus stop and we took a bus up to the tower Namsan Tower is located up a hillso after getting down at the bus stop you just need to walk upslope yourself The view from the observation deck is very nice The night lights across Seouls city area are simply too awesome too A must to go if you go Seoul
4810,3,We decided to visit Seoul tower after 6pm and on a Sunday The lines were incredible long  and when we got up it was a good view but to many people Dont know if going on a Sunday made it worse
4811,5,A must visit place in Seoul By taking the Namsan cable car ride up to the mountain and walk to the tower you would see the outstanding views of the city There is the Love Padlocks affixed at the N Seoul Tower and you will see thousands of love locks spreading the messages of love scattered around
4812,2,Tower located on a hilltop and you can either walk up or take cable car  View is nothing fantastic and it was extremely crowded and noisy with a long queue from cable car ticketing booth getting updown the tower and leaving the attraction
4813,4,Seoul Tower is cool to visit with a friend You can go about 34 of the way to the top easy and there is a giant 360 degree lookout there On the glass windows are points telling you which major cities are in that direction and how far they are The view is spectacular especially at night However if you would like to visit the restaurant at its peak you will need to make reservations weeks in advanced The restaurant is quite popular and tend to be booked for a long time I never got to get into that restaurant which was disappointing but the rest of the tower is a cool place to visit
4814,3,Everything is worth a watch  the view from top of the tower the traditional martial art and dance performance the locks of love etc except just avoid the Teddy Bear Museum which is pretty rubbish to me not to mention the entrance fee is rather expensive
4815,4,Worth the visit to see Seoul from all sides Helps one experience the breadth of the city Huge Beautiful views Short walk but steep incline from the bus stop to the tower Beware the souvenirs  Enjoy the Cold Stone Creamery ice cream after youve visited the top Also love seeing it from the city at night when its lit up Enjoy
4816,3,The view was fine but having to purchase a second ticket to reach the very top puts a damper on your mood
4817,3,I went to N Seoul Tower when it is raining So I wasnt able to go up to top of the tower You can buy a pad lock there and lock it at the love padlock trees
4818,4,Great view of Seoul city  river Han I recommend to visit the N Tower before the sunset to view the city during the day  the night
4819,5,Its worth the trip up just for the view of Seoul and the fantastic photo opportunities And theres always something interesting going on like an impromptu performance of some sort Going up in the tower itself is a treat as is having dinner at one of the restaurants where you can look out over the city while dining And the food is actually good This is a must see if you have the time while visiting Seoul 
4820,3,Just came back the Seoul tower; worth a visit only if you have a lots of time The views from top are OK to nice and as someone pointed out typical of a nice big city from any high rise building You can take public transportation to N S T very easily if you are willing to walk a bit After reaching the tower area my son and I took the cable car as we were tired from our morning touring Spent may be five minutes at the top; the lines to the elevator even during this off season weekday were long and it was getting quite stuffy in the area Another note this is very close from the War Memorial so you can do both in the same day Just do your homework on public transportation before starting Enjoy
4821,5,Great view of the city  Han River Go at night and watch the light shows Walking down the mountain is a bit of work with oddly spaced steps but it is really well worth it As a foreigner I felt really safe even late at night
4822,4,Second time going to Namsan Tower this time in the evening Took a bus which will alight you at the bottom of the tower do a 5 minutes walk up a steep road and there you are  While queuing for your tickets enjoy the cool breeze and take a walk along the edges to magnificent view  The night lights across Seouls city area are simply awesome Couples cuddling while enjoying the view and many tourists taking photos  There was this old couple on top of the tower frail and holding hands as they stood in front of the glass looking at the bright lights of Seoul with a faint smile on their face as if they found inner peace heart warming moment there  Less for the massive amount of tourist and waiting time to go up to the tower this place is definitely worth your while going Go on a clear sunny day if you are going during the day and pray it does not rain if you are going at night
4823,5,Good place to visit in a good weather and to exercise Visited N Seoul Tower in autumn during daylight and night both are stunning view If you want to try the cable car in weekend try to get there early since therell be some queuing It is a cozy place even if you simply just want to sit and enjoy the breeze
4824,4,I arrive there around 9pmppl still queuing to purchase tickets like hell  I gave up climbing up the tower  There a ice cream shop next to the bear shop u must try their recommended flavor It tastes amazing   V went there by bus 3 n 5  spending almost a dollar per person  good value of money spending about 30minutes to travel from begining of the station to the endingseoul tower
4825,5,Either during the day clear day or for dinner at night this is a great place to see the expand of the city I actually walked it up during the day not too bad but I did get lost a couple of times so getting there took longer than what it should take The easiest of course is taking the tram but on a nice cool day youll find a lot of folks exercising and enjoying the views and the cool weather Definitely worth if you have an extra day in Seoul
4826,4,Seoul has about 20000000 in the immediate area and you can see where most of them live from the towers observation deck
4827,4,This is a must see for the tourist in most travelers The cable car was funViews delightfulI would skip the Italian restaurant thoughVery pricey for a mediocre meal
4828,5,we have to climb up to hill to reach the placeneed more energy for thisbut once reach on top of the hill we may see the view of Seoul
4829,5,This is a good starting point for your exploration in Seoul the park is great so make sure you come here with enough time
4830,3,South Korea had fairly newer attractions this is a tower much like the others I would say that the tower in Malaysia and Paris were much better because of their height but can visit once if in South Korea
4831,4,It was nice visiting N Seoul Tower You get full view of Seoul from it  A must visit for people visiting Seoul Korea
4832,5,ive been here for 2 times and i really love this place so romantic ive veen there for dating with DH and i enjoy it just walking from seoul station quite far but i enjoy it 45km until go to N Tower best view for see around Seoul unforgettable 
4833,4,Great views but the ride from cable car may not be the most exciting becos os the long queue  the crowd Long queue to get down from the tower too
4834,5,Stunning views of the whole city in a very pleasant environment Easiily accessible on the no 5 bus from Namdaemun Market Highly recommended
4835,5,Seoul Tower is a great place to visit With amazing views great restaurants and a lot of stairs going up from the base across the street from the Millenium Seoul Hilton See if you can run up in less than 12 minutes Its quite the exercise workout
4836,4,After a good workout to get to the tower you are treated to a 360 view of Seoul I would highly recommend flat comfortable shoes as you have to walk a high incline to get to the tower for about 8 minutes
4837,4,We like the cable ride seeing everything below can really thrill my 9yr old sonnice scenery everything is lightly covered with snow we live i a tropical country i wouldnt say the place is excellent but the whole experience is At least the cable ride makes it different from tokyo tower and sidney towerboth in the middle of the city without mountains  greens Would be better though if you have a rough ramp or an elevator escalator for infants with strollerindeed tiring to carry both the baby and the stroller
4838,5,I always enjoy towers in the cities that have them and this one is top end One large hill so high high high Cable car up to base is alot of fun and in a park area so nice green start Go early or crowds start to grow but if so go 1 flight stairs down to departure area where much less people Views are totally wow and city forever
4839,5,Im a daydreamer to visit Seoul specially this place i want to see the view of the city from the tower
4840,4,You should not miss itfood up the tower us normal but a bit expensive but for looking d view is engh to sit reflex ur self to b good mood to go down to do the lver lock with ur loverdont miss it
4841,3,Go with your special someone Look at the lovely night views from high above It is a romantic but busy place However thats where its novelty ends Once is enough
4842,4,Romantic venue to visit RIght at the top of the stairs after you alight from the cable car you can see many couples kissing and hugging Many other attractions at this venue too Enjoy
4843,5,One of the most iconic landmarks in Seoul and also some of the best views of the landscape surrounding the heart of Seoul
4844,5,The weather was very poor so we decided not to pay the 12 to visit this attraction it would have been a waste of time as the weather was not too good that day But the views from the top of the hill were fantastic  We sat in the coffee bar which in my opinion had great views Great for all you romantics out there you can purchase padlocks that you can leave with a special little message on I have never seen so many locks The shop was selling loads of them  A def must a prob worth paying the money to go to the top of the tower
4845,5,You can enjoy the scenery of Seoul I love the locks which can be found around the tower before going up If it is too hazy save your money since you are not able to see much things there Just enjoy the scenery from below the tower
4846,3,its located in a very high place to go reach this place from myeong dong is just to take bus number 05 and we stop directly in down of N Seoul Tower we still need to walk to reach that tower and the route is very incline but really its worth during walking up there you can see seoul landmark a real nice view toilet also very clean thereoutside view is amazing and good place to take pictures but when you entered and be on the top of it you wont get the outdoor view like the peak in HK its all just indoor view and we can see out from telescope so its not that exciting to be on the top of that tower but overall its still good to try 
4847,3,The view from the tower was great but just like every other place in Korea is was crowded and very loud I spend 10000 won to go up to the observation tower but because of the crowd only stayed about 20 minutes You can see pretty good views without going up but again its very crowded
4848,3,Im not usually a fan of this kind of attraction  I dont really enjoy spending my time queuing for tickets being jammed into cablecars squeezing myself against glass for a nice view But N Seoul Tower was one of the better of these kinds of attractions  I think because Seoul is such a sprawling unimaginably expansive city  it was fascinating to see the city splayed out in all its glory We arrived just before sunset so were able to see the city at both day and night and I would strongly encourage this The night views were interesting just because of Koreas miniobsession with neon but personally I preferred the dayview You could get a real sense of the topography of the land including the beautiful mountains just behind the city
4849,5,We took the bus up here without any problems Beautiful view at the top although it was quite gray out when we went There is a snack shop up and a burger restaurant at the bottom They have a lot of information at the top about different areas in Korea If you are interested putting up a lock they sell them at the gift shop
4850,5,The N seoul tower is a must visit Recommended to go at sunset or night it offers a 360 deg breathtaking view of seoul
4851,4,Good place to visit My kid loves it so much It is even better if the weather if is good as well Went there by bus and back by cable car The cable car is worth to try
4852,5,A place you must see when visiting Seoul  the view is beautiful and its one of those symbolic places that must be seen Also the little locks that young people in love leave there are certainly a sight All in all an interesting experience
4853,4,In the holiday there are a lot of attraction like kingdom ceremony kungfu fighting tradisionil song and dance Etc Very interesting place to visite
4854,4,The best view over the city Its amazing how long you can see and the area is beautiful Easy access with the cable car and all the lockers are breathtaking A bit too expensive to go up in the tower but the view from the park is just as good There is also a outdoor gym at the top of you feel like work out whilst waiting to go down Strongly recommended
4855,5,We went on Earth Hour Something we forgot before hand lucky we took the opportunity while walking up the stairs to take some nice photos of the Tower  Original plan was to get the cable car but the lines were just too long so would recommend getting there early next time  It was a nice walk up to the tower after dinner great views highly recommended
4856,4,The instructions to the lift to the base station is not very accurate Get out from Exit 3 at Myeongdong Station and walk towards Shingsagae At the major interaction turn left and you should see the lift up the slope This lift will take you to the base station for the cable car right to the tower You need separate tickets for the cable car ride and the tower There is also the newly open Teddy Bear Museum at the base of the tower
4857,4,Went there at night and the view of the city was fabulous We decided to go on the cable car up to the base of the tower and that was an added bonus It wasnt cheap but wasnt expensive either All in all good value for money
4858,5,We caught the free elevator from Myeong dong to the cable cars to get to the tower as it is on top of Mt Namsen The elevator doesnt run on a Monday until 1pm but there are steps up to the cable cars if youre feeling energetic There is a viewing area inside the tower that you can visit without paying to go up and to be fair the view is probably just as good We spent quite a few hours up the tower There is a cafe and small gift shop You can also buy small tiles that you can write and and attach to a board there There is also a wishing well that you can buy a small plastic coin to through in Although we all missed At the bottom of the tower are lots of locks that people have written on and attached to the railings They do sell locks inside the tower or you can take your own There are a number of cafes at the bottom which are good value for money We also went in the teddy bear museum which is at the bottom of the tower It was good fun
4859,3,The North Seoul Tower is accessible by a number of routes The first time I went we walked and it was hot humid steep and tiring The second time we were on a hop on off Seoul tour bus Both times we did not get in because the queues were so long If you are desperate to get in then try getting there early
4860,5,I didnt expect that I would hike up the n seoul tower I was afraid of heights but still I survived You could see all of Seoul here Well I mean almost I just find it kinda expensive
4861,5,Let walk to Seoul tower to see the nice view of Seoul get good air and natural  if you go to Seoul should visit Seoul tower 
4862,4,For all couples and even friends and family this is the place you should not miss in Seoul Though avoid buying goodies from here as it is far costlier then local markets
4863,5,Its great to get a whole glimpse of the city and the nice weather up there Recommended for first timers in Korea Enjoyed the experience thoroughly
4864,3,The Teddy Bear Museum inside the Tower is a lot of fun although the scale is not as big as the famous one in Jeju The robotic teddy bears are used to portray the histories and activities of Korea Overall its an enjoyable experience for both children and adults  The view at the top of the tower was underwhelming esp at night as the glass windows were too reflective to see much or take photos
4865,3,I have been to quite a number of towers in Asia and found out this is the boring one The observation floor is quite small compared to other towers like Taipei 101 and is very packed Was trying to take some photos but there were lot of smudges across the glazing  The night view of Seoul is amazing though
4866,5,I went with my hubby as we split with others during our trip and we decide to go to Ntower  was thinking of something like in Korea drama haha however there was a lot of crowd so there is not much privacy T_T however I am happy to be able to see the famous Ntower staff are very friendly assisting guests overall was great experience
4867,5,its just one of the many things to see that lets people know youve been to Seoul there is a free yellow shuttle bus from myeongdong station that takes you to the cable car station for free
4868,4,A good place to get a 360 view of Seoul There is an elevator to take if you wish to take the cable car ride to the tower at Namsan Can opt for 5 min depending on traffic taxi ride from Myeongdong Subway Exit No 9 for about KRW 3000 instead if you want to skip the short uphill walk to elevator
4869,4,People said this is a couples attraction and well its truebut there are some groups of young people old people and everything in between too It can be very crowded so prepare ahead I went on a Friday night around 830 and there was a 40 minute wait just to board the cable car Walking up to the tower area is an option but its quite far and I dont really recommend it unless youre looking for a good step workout The lookout is cool The glass was pretty smeared with fingerprints but still got some cool shots on my phone Also I hear that the mens restroom urinals overlook the city through glass The womens has wash sinks where you can gaze at the city through the glass
4870,3,The wait was long and when you get to the top it is incredibly crowded unless you want to pay another 20 dollars to go up to the observatory Its a nice date night or one time thing if youre in Seoul though
4871,4,Take the cable car ride to Seoul Tower and bring your own lock if you can to save some cash You can add your love lock on the Wall of Love Great place to visit for us since we seen it in some Korea drama  Also a short bus ride to the market from here
4872,3,the park in which the seoul tower is situated is lovely and green and relaxing and a great place for leisurely strolls the tower is set on a hill and the views from the bottom of the tower are just as good as the views from the top so dont feel you are missing out if you dont go to the top  it costs w9000 to get up the tower and takes 25seconds to get to the top  once in the lift you can take the cable car from the street below the park to just below the tower a one way trip costs w6000 if you struggle with stairs and walking uphill it might be a good option for you
4873,5,This is very famous because it is the highest structure in Seoul and gives you ca very good bird eyes view of the city You can also check out the cable cars and the namsan park just before it There are also martial arts and music exhibition right at the lobby of the tower  To get to the N Seoul Tower tale the subway line 3 or 4 and get off at Chungmuro area From the exit you can take a Namsan tour bus bus number 2
4874,2,I would not really recommend here unless you have a date at the restaurants on top of the tower The view is nice but honestly its quite smoggy during the day so your visibility is low Seoul doesnt really have any unique architecture that sticks out or any natural wonders that you can view from the tower i think youd be better off climbing a mountain like gwanaksan for free and get a nice workout and a better view from there
4875,4,Stunning views enjoyed the best burgers in Seoul so much so that we went back a few days later in freezing weather for more
4876,3,So this wasnt really high on my priority list of to see in Seoul but went there we did It was a very foggy day with poor visibility so I dont know why we bothered We took the cable ride up  tiny cable cars btw They pack you all in so tight that its hard to get a good panoramic view of the city You can also walk up the hill if youre up for the challenge and want a good work out; which would be fine with me but not when we had an 85  4 yr olds with us The grounds surrounding the base of N Tower is beautiful and serene That would probably the best part of the site You could bring a picnic and come hang out here and let the kids run wild N Tower as it turns out has become a bit of a lovers destination The place to meet with potential lover first encounter date and make ever lasting promise of your undying love to each other by putting a lock marked with your names and attaching it to any free space on the railings if you can find a spot Good luck as there have been 100000s before you Shops and cafes at the base of the tower caters to said lovers Even a store selling locks if you forgot to bring your own The place is dripping with cheese Enough to make a cold hearted nonromantic such as myself want to hurl All in all nothing that interesting to see but if you just want to be outdoors near nature and get a good exercise this is a nice place to come
4877,4,we visited here however did not go up the tower due to the haze  Felt it would have been a waste as it was a poor visability day We hadgreat fun walking below the tower which already has grate views and bought a lock for 8000 was good fun trying to find a spot for it with all the thousands of others
4878,4,This is a fun place to visit Not to be missed are the great views from the Tower especially on a clear day You will need to do some walking and the place can get crowded with tourists
4879,5,The walk up to the tower area is a little steep but well worth it The view just from the base of the tower is really nice I loved the lock wall
4880,5,N tower is located in central  easy to go up by bus Weve visited there many times Each time the atmosphere was totally different   four seasons day and night Revolving top Restaurant was great as The View in Marriott hotelManhattan NY beautiful fresh and a great place for families and couples
4881,4,Torrential thunderstorm while we were heading up to the Tower Fortunately it cleared up and we had a wonderful view of the city without too many people To my wifes delight I had brought an engraved lock with both our names a heart and the date After looking around a bit we decided on a location and locked our love away
4882,4,Lots and lots of people in love bring or buy locks to leave at the tower as an expression of their commitment Very charming and watching them is delightful I went to the top and found the sights very interesting
4883,3,The cable car ride up was probably my favorite part Nice views and a little getaway from the city Once there its a small hike up and then mostly a park My wife liked the padlock fence which has a million padlocks all over Most are rusted but my wifes eyes seem to look past that Haha  It seemed to take a quarter out of our day in total to do but we didnt have much on our agenda anyway So if youre super pressed for time and youre a seasoned traveler and able to skip those kinds of thingsdo
4884,4,we went there on a Saturday evening and the weather was extremely pleasant We took a cable car ride to the top though I realized later that we could have climbed to the top and that would be quite some experienceIt would be good if they mention the approximate time to stay in queue to get to the cable car ride as the visitors can decide whether they want to do this or not At the base of the Tower we had several food options and I liked the whole experience out there There was a place where many couples came to lock thier love and longetivity of their relationship There was a live band playing over there and the Light and Sound show in the Night was worth waiting for We could not go till the top of the tower as they had a long waiting time of more than 15 hours Wish we had known this at the entrance so that we could buy our tickets earlier
4885,4,We bought the tickets to go up the tower but once we were up there we felt kind of disappointed Because the air conditioning was not turned on and it was summer hence it was hot and stuffy so we didnt stay long in the tower So I recommend that it is not a mustdo to pay quite an expensive fee to go up the tower  However the ground level view is good enough to get an aerial birds eye view of the city The air is fresh because of all the greenery and we wished we had brought food to do a picnic in the namsan park This offers a good break from the hustle and bustle of city life but beware of the touristy crowds that tend to flood the place
4886,4,I ran up the garden path to the top of the mountain The gardens were immaculate and the path steps were very well maintained The view from the tower balcony at the bottom was great I didnt go up the tower itself and probably wouldnt have seen anything more than I did from the lower deck which was free  The fence was completely covered in padlocks which local lovers put there for good luck  Really interesting free and a great view
4887,5,Couple can come to this place to put their lock on Thousands locks here made the atmosphere so romantic
4888,4,This is the best place to see the overall scenery of Seoul with its skyline and beautiful mountains surrounding the city
4889,5,Check out this romantic hangout You can buy a lock and write a wish and then lock it on the metal fences with the hundreds of thousands of other locks you can see everywhere The view is 360 degrees of Seoul which is rather spectacular at night Oh wait you havent even went to the top of the tower yet The view only gets better from higher up
4890,5,Tower is nice shopping in Itaewin area night life in Gangnam district more shopping in Nam Daemun open market Taxis are best bc no parking or difficult to find  Must see take the Inchoen Airport day tour of Inchon you will see the massive and impressive bridge they built connecting the mainland to the island of Inchon and airport you will take a ferry and see the fish market very easy cheap and great day trip right from the airport
4891,4,I like to go there at night to find a great city night view Not only for lovers but with friends after having a dinner is one of the nicest things to do in Seoul In winter it can be very cold and windy
4892,4,During day time you may find the Seoul Tower to be very boring and bland All you can see are the structure and couple locks But everything changes when go there just before sunset I once caught the sun set and it was mesmerizing It added a lot and changes everything  At night you can see the tower as the center if attraction with its blue light against the city Lots of couple are there but dont worry if youre single you can enjoy the place still  Theres a cafe inside so if you feel cold especially during spring autumn winter you can have a sip of hit coffee from time to time
4893,5,Take the cable cars Spcly in the night its sooo worth it plus it doesnt cost too much the view is just breathtaking
4894,5,This place is famed for couples coming here to celebrate their bond in strictest modesty Lots of restaurants and the cable car that gets you up the mountain affords some pretty good views You have to take an elevator super fast to the top and when you get there the 360 degree view of this vast city is fairly jaw dropping The windows are marked with latitudelongitude pointing to various cities around the world Naturally I stood in front of the window pointing to the North PoleGo at night for best results
4895,5,I did Seoul Tower on my last day in Korea and it was so worth it The view was so incredible Its worth every penny
4896,4,So I heard you can see North Korea from the top of the tower Perhaps but it was unclear once I got up there Seoul is a vast city and the tower is the only way to truely apreciate it If you want to get there  ask at the info booth at any SMRT metro sation They will tell you which bus to take and where from
4897,5,Wasnt as packed as I thought it would be for a saturday so it made the trip much more enjoyable Love that we were able to buy the Love locks write our names and add them to the thousands of others They have an amazing burger place and the views were gorgeous
4898,5,This place was amazing I have never been to anything like this and maybe thats why Im giving it such a high rating but I thought it was wonderful I came with my University on a field trip and this was one of the location we visited This tower was opened in 1980 and has been a major tourist attraction since This is said to be a very popular couples destination as many people propose there There is a lock tree which it is said that you can lock your love with your partner and they will never let you go That sounds so cute but of course not always true There was a wall inside that has notes and letters from people who came there The view is spectacular they have a nice gift shop and they do have a cafe I would definitely suggest going here with a really close friend or your partner I think it would be a great trip for you both but someone will spend a lot of money in the gift shop
4899,2,Not having clean windows both inside and outside was a great disappointment They seem to have a lots of staff in their shops but no one available to clean fingerprints inside Since a lot of visitors put their hands and fingers on the glass windows I would have expected better
4900,5,If you like birds eye views Seoul Tower is the place to go I loved getting to see the places I visited in Seoul from the view in the sky With a 360 degree observation deck you can sit and sink into the beautiful landscape that is Seoul After you have spent your time in the sky there are great attractions around the tower as well My favorite was the mounds of locks from couples around the world With years of stories left behind it is obvious that Seoul tower is a popular date spot for couples The numerous locks representing memories and hopes for the future make for a unique photo opportunity Travelers must be warned though to see these beauties one must be prepared to walk up a pretty steep incline What you find at the top if definitely worth the walk
4901,3,god views from Seulinteresting locks monuments expensive restaurants and snacks full of people Nothing special but a part of tourist plans
4902,5,Where to start This place was awesome Theyre a few places to eat here as well as a souvenir shop Seems like everything has one The popular Locks of Love are here and so are great places for photos There was a small hike to the actual tower but it wasnt terrible It will test you a bit though so it helps if your a little athletic The buses only drive up so far the hike is the last thing before arriving at the tower My photos only hint at the experience but Seoul Tower is one place you dont want to pass up
4903,5,Popular place in Seoul with nice view in evening to night you can see 365 panoramic view on the NS Tower but pretty crowded if go there in late at evening the way to Tower need to walk up to the hill so who get leg problems its probably not good
4904,5,Our group of 5 were lift up in 30second ride to the observation deck The weather was good at 20deg Celsius slight drizzle sky was clear It was a spectacular night view of bustling Seoul from the top For travelling couples bring along and get your love padlocked with memorable photos You may prefer walking up the hill or get a ride down on the electric bus To say the least it was just fantastic
4905,4,It was very hazy today but this site was so unique I would do it again tomorrow if it was a clear day For a 7 round trip cable car ride you get to not only to the highest point in Seoul but also the geographic center There is several acres on top of Mt Namsan at the base of the tower with plaques explaining its history as well as a restaurant and snack vendors
4906,4,This is definitely one of the must see attractions in Seoul in order to get a great view of the city The best time to go is on a clear day shortly before sunset Give yourself plenty of time to get to the top of the mountain and expect large crowds and a bit of a wait to get to the observation deck if you go on a weekend or holiday We were able to get to the top of the tower right as the sun was going down so got some amazing pictures of the sunset and then the city after dark The only thing I didnt care for was that there was no outdoor observation deck so the only option for picture taking is through the glass windows But even then the view is amazing and I still got some amazing pictures both from the top of the tower and from the top of Namsan
4907,3,We were here on May 28 2013 It was a weekday and the place wasnt crowded We walked from the hotel to the tower about 20 minutes and took the elevator to the main floor to buy tickets to use the cable car The ride is about 10 minutes to get to the base of the tower There is a small park various stores a restaurant and other novelties The day was somewhat foggy so we opted to stay at the base However you can go further up the tower but need to pay yet another fee The view from the base was OK An hour or so walking around at this level should be enough No issues with crowds or waiting on long lines You can go there if you have nothing better to do in Seoul Ask around about other places with good city views that are free
4908,4,We stayed here from before sunset to after sunset as we wanted to see the lights at night The tower looks more beautiful with the lights so Id recommend you to come at night instead 
4909,4,Seoul Tower was one of my most favorite attractions in Seoul It was a beautiful place to see the vastness of the city The locks of love portion of the tower was a treasure within itself It was so neat to see all of the messages written on the locks even though I couldnt read them Before going to Seoul I hadnt heard about the locks It is definitely a great date spot I also visited the Teddy Bear Museum which wasnt quite what I expected but was still a great pit stop I highly recommend going up onto one of the observation decks to get the full experience You can buy a ticket to the general observation deck and then once there you can buy a ticket to a higher observation deck Going on a clear day would allow for the best viewing There is also an area where you can buy a postcard and send mail off from the observation deck Mailing to the US was little more expensive but totally worth it to send a letter of love
4910,5,This is one of beautiful place i visited in KoreaComing ehre at night and u can see the light city panorama of Seoul  Dont forget bring ur lock and lock it here for ur love P
4911,5,The views from the top of the tower are stunning though obviously best when it is a clear day Only at the top of the tower did we appreciate just how big this city is We really liked how they labelled Seouls attractions across the windows at the top so you could work out where they were The placing of city names in other countries such as New Zealand Australia across other windows gave us a sense of direction It costs about 9000 won each to go up the tower and if you wonder why a double ticket costs more than two single tickets its because it includes a big bucket of popcorn The lift is very fast and the staff friendly and efficient You should bring a camera and wear comfortable shoes and look round the park below on the way up or down or both
4912,5,look nowhere further for the romantic sunset date complete with locks to inscribe your names to be held tight and secure at the windy top of Namsan Go through also a short national history with the teddy bears at the teddy bear museum on top see if you see the Gangnam style bear still there
4913,3,Entry fee was quite expensive and it was a foggy day with unclear view Not worth going up the tower
4914,5,Great panoramic views at the top I went there in the evening until it was dark The view of Seoul at night was breathtaking Worth the money The souvenir shop was full of gorgeous things which I regret not buying 
4915,4,It was a very hot day when I went up the Tower so it was quite hazy Id like to go again on a clear day as you must be able to see for miles
4916,4,It was 11 degrees on the day we went up to N Seoul Tower Definitely cold but the view was awesome  You can choose to walk up the stairs to the tower or take the cable car We took the cable car and it was 8000 Won per person for a twoway trip We went into the Teddy Bear Museum and the Observatory It was very nice and worth the money  N Seoul Tower is actually visible from the streets of Myeongdong From here you can actually walk up to the cable car station we did this or take a bus
4917,4,We went there on a group tour on 1032012 It was very cold and the temperature was just a few degrees above 0 C Our tour bus parked at some sort of a bus parking area and we walked up a winding road straight to the tower Along the road we saw trees without leaves and the beautiful sight was something new for us who live in the tropics The area surrounding the base of the tower was quite large Among the attractions there were a the thousands of locks which represented eternal love There were several benches which were bent as if an extremely heavy person has sat on it b the signage of the geographical center of Seoul if I am not mistaken c a small templelike structure which was great for phototakings We could also see the city of Seoul although the view was not that clear due to the hazy conditions We didnt go up the tower because of the time constraint On our trip down we saw several joggers running up the hill If you go around this time please remember to bring along your winter clothing and especially your gloves A good place to begin our tour of Korea
4918,5,I visited Namsan Seoul Tower It was quite interesting to have a look Teddy Bear Museum located in Namsan Tower The Teddy Bear Museum has a wonderful combination of Teddy Bears old and new Some of them were rare items Teddy Bear Museum at Namsan Tower is worth while visiting Tip In Cherry Blossum Season Spring and in Autumn Leaves Season the way to Namsan Tower is even more beautiful I had coffee with my friend at Hyatt Hotel in Namsan and it was quite enjoyable with excellent views and with live music performances
4919,4,Worth going The cable car leading up to the tower is a bit packed though You cant really enjoy the view while in it The Tower offers a nice view of Seoul
4920,5,There is a cable car to get to the top it does cost or you can get your exercise by walking up to it This up on top of a mountain so walking is straight up The view from the top of Seoul Tower is excellent but some days the view is not so clear with pollution and such
4921,5,It is a great place to view the city It was a bit crowded when I was there but still a great place to visit Be sure not to miss the fence filled with locks located near the bottom of the tower
4922,4,Im not so much impress with the tower itself but the experience going up to the site is nicethat is if you choose to walk the 2 kilometer trail up to the tower We did it in the morning with perfect weather and company Going up is a bit a challenge esp if you lack exercisebut you will be amazed how local old people walk so fast and full of energythey arr our inspirationif they can do itwhy cant we 
4923,5,A wonderfull sightseeing tour To see this huge city from top of the tower what an experiece We spend a relaxing day with some South African friends A day to remember and a MUST see for foreingers
4924,3,Hard to get a day where it isnt foggy although the view is decent its nothing that will leave you speechless  Good for an hour or two dont plan your entire day around it though
4925,4,Coming here during day time by bus and along the long drive up the view along the way up was simply awesome Breathing in the fresh air and a view in front of u that was such a beauty At first we did thought of walking up here but luckily we didnt as the ride up here was definitely a long hike Bought the combo ticket of  Tower  Teddy bear museum well oh well Teddy bear museum was kind of disappointing and the tower was well to me on the average as compared to the one in Macau  Overall will recommend for the visit as the natural atmosphere of the ground level that makes up for this bit
4926,5,I got engaged here  Go on a clear night to enjoy the lighting show on the tower  take the cable car up from the base and enjoy the view up If you dont go up to the observatory at least explore the base and leave a lock on the fence symbolizing your love and commitment for someone you love
4927,4,Love the wall of locks Bring your own locks and create memories with your loved ones Then sit by the viewing gallery with snacks and drinks nice
4928,5,Seeing the tower closeup from the outside is pretty cool although I think its kind of ugly  but go to the top and enjoy the amazing view of the city  We went at night and my only gripe was that the top floor we went to was so lit up with souveriner stores I hear that it used to be dark at night which allowed for photos and better general enjoyment
4929,4,Beautiful 360 view of Seoul but be prepared to walk up a hill 3045 minutes to see it There may be another way up that I am not aware of but unfortunately I met some friends up there and was all sweaty by the time I made it up Theres a restaurant and other activities at the entrance of the tower The food is average
4930,5,It is quite the hike up the hill to the tower bottom but there are also buses that run after you get halfway I caught the bus The base of the tower is two floors of restaurants and gift shops You can buy a ticket to catch the amazingly fast and smooth elevator to the observation deck The view of the city at night was breathtaking I plan to visit during the day time next time Once you are done you can hike down the mountain or catch the bus my grandson and I did this and get back to the parking at the National Theater It was a great visit and not expensive at all
4931,5,This is a must do in Seoul on a clear day It really helps you to get a feel for how big the city really is and its not expensive nor are there long lines The best way to do it is to buy the round trip cable car ticket or to get off here from the Seoul bus tour You can also catch the number 3 bus in Itaewon  Note taxis and private cars are no longer allowed to go up to the tower  Tip there are hiking trails to go up and down the tower as well Avoid the tower restaurant Over priced and not that great
4932,5,Personally I believe the trip up the observatory though it is a small observatory A walk around probably just need 58mins is worth it as you get to see the whole city of Seoul I just felt the trip to N Seoul tower isnt complete if I had not went to the observatory  You can even lock up your love with your partner at Seoul tower Buying a lock there isnt that worthwhile as it cost KRW11000 Suggest to prep your own There are also some restaurants or eateries there which you can enjoy your meal together with the fantastic view
4933,4,A must see If youve ever been to Taipei 101 then you must come here From my personal experience I would prefer the N Seoul Tower over Taipei 101 N Seoul Tower is indoors and it offers a 360 view It was around 1520 bucks per person One tip would be to come right before the sunset youll get great pictures
4934,4,Best to come in the evening as the tower will look stunning We went to observatory deck  the night view of entire Seoul is excellent Nice spot for couples too There is a food court serving cheap  good food at ground level if the restaurants are too pricey Teddy Bear Museum is definitely a waste
4935,4,I didnt take a ticket to go up to the observatory however the view is nice from the around the tower with lots of things to see I find to enjoy this experience is to walk up from the bottom of the road instead of taking the cable car or the bus The walk is about 1 hour and so nice along the winding road which is mostly shaded Lots of people walking their dogs jogging and just enjoying the day out Food and drink is expensive when you reach the top  5 dollars for an ice cream  so you may want to pack some things in your day pack before you gowater etc It was nice to see Seoul from this point
4936,5,This spot is somewhat outstanding for a vacation spot in Seoul To get a grasp for a city that is constantly growing in size you can go to N Seoul Tower and take a look around and see the whole city of Seoul On a clear day you can see the city carved out of the mountains  There is also a clever saying that you can buy a lock for you and your sweet heart on the chain fence with two keys Each member of the couple has a key so if you break up you can go remove your lock if you can find it they do cut off some of the crazier locks and trim the locks down now and then  You could also buy a tile and put it on the wall with a message but all the messages are removed after New Years  There is a tram that goes to the top but walking and looking at the sketch artists or occasional performance groups is enjoyable as well
4937,3,the view during the day is nothing like the evening city view Going at the top of the tower with a date in the evening overviewing the city lighted is really something
4938,5,hi all 1 yes the walk up the hill is steep  but if you can do it pls do it 2 go up to the top of the tower in the evening  wait until all the little stars in the windows begin to glow  a sea of lights in all directions 3 write a postcard they provide postcardsmail box in the tower view area dont forget all your addresses 4 its save to walk down lets say at 930  10 pm  still many people on the paths cheers
4939,3,Hmm the tower seems to be a little crowded when we went Had to queue for sometime before we were allowed on the lift up Had to queue even longer when we had to wait for the lift to get down Probably around 3045 mins The view was ok only You can buy a postcard from them and mail it back home to yourself because its the highest mail box in korea hur hur The highlight to me was rather the love locks at the foot of the tower Its pretty and it would be nice to hang a love lock with your loved one 
4940,4,Often in a new city I do take the effort to visit towers or tall buildings with observation decks given my line of work I dont often enjoy them given how most of these visits are often crammed full with tourists usually overpriced and due to the nature of having to move vertically  you have to endure packed elevators on top of the lines Still I do make the effort if I have the time and there are the occasional highlights  plus some cities really look so much better from up high  The N Seoul Tower in Seoul South Korea is definitely one of the pluses in my book Although in terms of infrastructure there really isnt anything remarkably different about the N Seoul Tower I definitely enjoyed my visit there and count it as among the highlights of my week long Seoul adventure  One of the major attractions of the N Seoul Tower is its location atop the scenic Namsan mountain in the centre of the city The tower is fringed by nature and the absence of cars gives the space a certain serenity thats marred only by the shuttle buses that ply the route up Its definitely worthwhile making your way here just to enjoy the view from the base of the tower soaking in natures splendour and enjoying an ice cream from one of the many retailers here I was here in Spring so the weather was crisp cool and really almost perfect  The N Seoul Tower has a unique positioning as the place for love with many lovesmitten folks hanging padlocks declaring their everlasting bonds on structures and fences at the base It makes for some pretty ornaments albeit expensive ones but really this notion of public testaments of love seems pretty tacky Plus the whole idea of a padlock reminds me more of a prison than love but hey thats my opinion entirely  The good thing about the love connection here at the tower is that it lends the whole space a whole lot more charm and appeal And the management of the place obviously knows this and uses this to their benefit well what with couple benches and lovethemed souvenirs Towers and tall buildings can be sterile and industrial so this loveydovey angle is really a compelling angle to have  As compelling as the site is the star of course is the tower itself The N Seoul Tower has a few observatory levels including two restaurants I only did the views so cant comment on the dining options up high Tickets are not as pricy as some other towers starting at around RM24 USD8 which is really pretty decent Theres a combo ticket option which gives you entry to the Teddy Bear Museum also located onsite which I highly recommend  The tower visit itself is fairly generic You have a fancy elevator ride up thats decked out with multimedia this time on the elevator roof The observatory levels offer great views and there are retail outlets too offering gifts and snacks One nice addition is the opportunity to send a postcard overseas from the little postal office there I also liked how they indicated the distance to other major Asian cities on the glass windows based on the direction you are facing I can see many tourists looking for home and I did too  So if you ever find yourself in Seoul do check out the N Seoul Tower If you do a relaxed visit with a meal the Teddy Bear Museum and a walk around the site thrown in its a good half day at least Check out the main website for access information and hours and Ive heard that the night view is stunning Definitely a site I will recommend
4941,5,Seoul is so spread out that you dont get a perspective of its size unless you are up here at the tower We enjoyed a superb lunch at the revolving restaurant  as good as any restaurant you would go to purely for the food The gardensforest surrounding the tower complex are gorgeous A must do in Seoul
4942,3,We visited on the weekend and made a few mistakes trying to get to the top restaurant including taking the cable car long lines and not quite knowing which line was for the right lift to the top Once there we had a spectacular view of Seoul which really helped put this sprawling city in perspective The French restaurant is good pricey but the food better than the average high price scenic fare Give yourself 90 minutes to get to the top then enjoy 
4943,4,We had been walking for a good part of the day so the walk up to the cable car station from Nanbok Cultural Village really took its toll on us At the cable car station the queue started from level 1 though it took us about 2030 mins to get into the carriage  When we reached the other side it was a 1015 min climb towards the tower We stopped for a break at a snack stall on the way up By the time we go there we were pretty exhausted but enjoyed the night view of Seoul city nonetheless  The only attraction of Seoul Tower is the panoramic view of the city If you are hardpressed for time though I would recommend to skip this attraction because it takes a bit of time to get to the tower in the evening
4944,4,Its good place to see sunset and a city view of Seoul Train route is short just ard 3 mins one way
4945,4,You take a tram to get up there and it is really a neat way to see Seoul from great heights There is a 360 degree room that you can walk around and take pictures of Seoul
4946,2,It takes you roughly 20 mins of up hill climbing to get to the cable car station We spent about 2 hours queueing for every little part of the Seoul Tower Experience Will not go again
4947,3,If you goin in spring there are cherry blossoms along the road while you walk to the Tower The lift to the top of the tower will be more unique if it can see through while on the way to the top Too many fingerprints or dirt on the glass which makes taking photos hard If you are going at night its even more difficult to take the photo as the glass reflect the lighting from the sovernier stall Best time to visit is 6pm8pm You can see Seoul in daytime and night time
4948,5,It had a Starbucks at the top and waffles and ice cream hamburgers etc Tons of locks on the fences for loved ones It really was a long way up and if Jan my friend Ruths husband had not been there to hold my arm I never would have made it Lots of families made the climb and had ice cream or whatever and sat and looked out the big windows I was really happy I made it to the top of the hill
4949,3,I went there at night via cable car which I recommend as the ascent can be quite fun and you slowly get a wider and wider view of Seoul as you go up Its good enough for you to stay at the base of the tower and the open air environment feels nice at night Nothing much to do though aside from eating or looking at the view  The top of the tower is a bit soso Its not that significantly higher imo You dont get to feel the height either as there are no glass floors for you to look down The buildings are indistinguishable at night so you cant identify the popular landmarks
4950,4,To get up to this place you can either take the bus taxi or cable car However I would recommend you to walk up and plan it around half an hour before sunset The 1200 m walk is not all that tough From Myeongdong Station or Hoehyeon Station walk towards Sogongro along Toegyero At the junction of Sogongro and Toegyero you can see N Seoul Tower Walk towards it uphill and you will find an elevator This elevator actually brings you to the level of the cable car station Turn right and start you walk up to the tower  As the sun sets you will see different hue in the sky along the way up Also there is a good view point to see Seoul below you  Currently there is a light show projected onto the tower And with the night lights it is very romantic  And a glass of beer after the walk up is only KRW 4000  Well worth the walk
4951,5,Owesome place to go I went there during Autumn so the scenery was very orange and those leaves were ready to fall Good for taking photos and spending good time with your love ones
4952,5,We just smiled and smiled First there is the cable car then the walk to the top then the elevator ride and the beautiful sunset We bought the most souvenirs here it was fun
4953,3,Its a cable car ride to the viewing point and then further tickets required for the view from the tower We decided that wed seen enough from the cable car stop off point as the view was not that spectacular Seoul has no amazing architectural landmarks  its just a huge urban sprawl and it all looked the same from every angle of the viewing platform Not a patch on the Peak view in Hong Kong or the Sky view in Ho Chi Minh City Its definitely a mustdo though and the restaurants and coffee shops on the way up to the cable car entrance are very good
4954,3,Went to N Seoul Tower in the evening as we wanted to get both the day and night view We took the bus to the foot and climbed up The climb may be tiring for elderly The elevator was a good surprise Nice view
4955,4,The views are good but due to the haze that is omnipresent the visibility is better at night when the city is alight Be preparedfor a Crowd The walk up or down is nice but its quite steep A taxi can take you almost up but you still have 3040 m uppbars to walk
4956,4,I got off at MyeongDong station with the crazy intention of walking to the Tower I managed it and walked in beautiful forested slopes but it is quite a hike May Day was a lovely sunny day and from the top of the tower and along the way I got some great views I would say worth the visit and worth a leisurely walk
4957,3,It was drizzling on a cold spring day when we visited the Seoul Tower We took the green shuttle bus No5 at Myeongdong Station near exit 3 and alighted at Namsam Park From there it was an uphill walk towards the tower Up at the plaza area we could still enjoy some good views of the city below us The weather wasnt perfect but we still went up to the Seoul Tower for a higher view We took the elevator up and were taken by surprise with the motiongraphics display inside the lift It made us feel like astronauts traveling in a space shuttle into the galaxy At the observatory we were disappointed with the 360 view due to the fog The view up there in an enclosed observatory was actually worst than the open view down below at the plaza The only worthwhile thing to mention about the observatory is the restroom Try to visit it even if you dont need to use it  youll be amazed
4958,5,Recommend two visits  once at night and once in the day to get a great view of Seoul The Tower is a fun place to visit The hamburgher restaurant is very good
4959,3,You have to be extremely determined to get to the top of this tower Theres no quick and easy way A city tour bus stops here  the hop on hop off type Local buses venture up and my guide book says that taxis carrying foreign tourists can drive up Theres also a cable car but thats no quick and easy trip either The base of the cable car has no nearby metro and its a climb just to get there On my way down I did see some shuttle buses but as a tourist good look with finding out where they go to Theres a rail car which covers part of the way from the base station to the street level  Anyway back to the tower When you get off your bus youre still faced with a steep climb to the tower Fatties beware You buy your ticket then you look round for signs where to go and see none so naturally you head to the base of the tower and inside you do a complete circuit past numerous cafes etc and see a lift Then youre told that this is not the lift up The man points to a public phone across a pathway outside and a small alleyway behind it You look for the signs and still see none Not any in English anyway The pathway leads you in to a building with various entertainments and you still find yourself looking around and having to ask where the lift is Eventually at some point in your life you get to the top of the tower  The view is ok During my 9 day stay I went up on what was probably the clearest sunniest day and it was still very hazy There were no distant views to be enjoyed As always I venture up these towers mid to late afternoon for daytime photos and stay until after dark for night shots Seoul didnt really come to life and light up very much Not like say Hong Kong Tokyo Shanghai and Sydney It was disappointing From a photographic point of view the cleanliness of the windows was good  Now the descent I chose to use the cable car By the time youve walked down the multitude of steps to discover the huge queue youre unlikely to feel like climbing all the way back up to get a bus down So you join the queue and during that time youre expecting to come across a ticket booth or pay on entry thing Not quite By the time you get to a point close to boarding you see that almost everybody has already got a ticket by some means Your option is to exit the queue and buy a ticket form the vending machine at point of boarding While you are trying to work out how to use the nonEnglish machine 50 people who were behind you are now in front and filling up that single slowmoving cable car If youre quick and lucky you just manage to get in that car as I did without having to wait 10 minutes for the next one  At the base station its a case of wandering around and deciding on the options Youre still fairly high up There are steps down to street level and as mentioned earlier a rail car Some of the nonEnglish speaking tourists found a bay with shuttle buses went to investigate then returned to the rail car where I was having been unable to find out which buses went where Once youre back on the street its about a 20 minute walk to a metro station And youre still going downhill  So as I said at the beginning you have to be extremely determined to venture up this tower
4960,5,this will give you a spectacular view of Seoul romantic place to go to especially at night what with the LOVE theme of the whoke park
4961,4,Theres a Namsan shuttle bus which makes getting here very convenient The view is spectacular you can view SEOUL see the 63 building  the Hand River from the distance as well as the Blue House The elevator ride up to the observatory area was a a bit lame to mebut overall I had an amazing time Make sure to wear walking shoes
4962,5,Take the cable car to the Mountain the view is greatdo bring your own lock if you going with your love one interest place  I was there before noon and the view of the city was clear and nice
4963,5,You will NEVER appreciate the shear size of Seoul unless you make the trip up into the tower The expansive city is best seen from here and you can see forever Set aside time to soak it it and bring a padlock It is a tradition to lock a padlock to the fencing as a symbol of everlasting love between two people There has to be a million already on the fences
4964,5,My friend and I chose to visit after dark to get maximum impact We took the cable car up which was fun and saved us a loooong climb You will still need to climb some steps to get to the entrance and first viewing platform The attraction is exceptionally well laid out and ticket purchasing was uncomplicated and smooth We then took the skylift to the beacon viewing platform  It really is an amazing sight the full 360 degrees of a vast and colourful city From each window you are reminded of what lies beyond by capital city names and distances printed in large lettering gives a wonderful appreciation of where you are in the world in relation to the globe There are a lot of shopping opportunities on this level and all budgets are catered for from postcards right up to huge stuffed animals We took our time before dropping back down to the lower level where you can eat or grab a coffee Here they have two interesting features; a wall which houses small ceramic tiles purchased by couples or families and inscribed with love notes or photos and then placed on the wall; and outdoors 6 amazing metal trees laden down with padlocks which we understood were pledges or love tokens also Have to be seen to be believed Cute and commercial at the same time essential Korea When we were finished we chose to walk back down but had no idea which direction to take so we just set off It took about 30 minutes to reach ground level and we landed at the university side of the city It was very pretty with strings of coloured paper lanterns hanging along the university perimeter After we had eaten in a local restaurant we noted the lanterns had been switched off around 10pm I expect Thoroughly enjoyed this tourist attraction my last evening in Korea
4965,4,This attraction isnt overly expensive and tries to had some excitement like the HD screen showing simulated outer space in the ceiling of the lift  well the do make nice screens in Korea currently  The windows are labelled with places in the direction you are viewing so you can take a photo with a label but you might have to wait a little The venue is not crowded even on a Sunday and nobody is hurrying you through
4966,4,this is a wonderful way to see seoul be sure to go at sunset so you can enjoy both the day and early evening views of this amazing city it can get pretty busy up there so plan to stay up long enough at a leisurely pace instead of rushing  would be great for a family too
4967,4,Its a place to see the whole Seoul from the highest tower It is recommended to go there at around 1700 before sunset So that you can watch the day and night view within 2 hours
4968,5,Great views enough to entertain you for a couple of hours Worth a visit Go at sunset to get the best of both worlds The tower is lit up blue on clear nights
4969,4,We took the cable car up from the bottom of the hill to the top of Namsan Park  N Seoul Tower Great view but the cable car ride was on the expensive side for the cramped experience it provided Ive taken many cable car rides before and this was not the most brilliant N Seoul Tower has a few attractions in itself to offer visitors but from there its another entrance fee to go up I didnt go as I thought the hill already provided a great view of the city from 3 corners Good to go up the hill for a visit but I certainly wouldnt advise paying to go up
4970,5,This is a must when visiting Seoul There is a cable car which will take you to the top but can be very crowded We walked the steep incline with our 3 grandsons ages 246 There could have got there much faster than we did At the top we ate burgers which were wonderful as we sat over looking the beautiful city at night On the way up we took many pictures thinking what a lovely city but by the time we made it to the top and ate it was dark My what a site The light were worth the walk very impressive There was a small charge to ride up to the top of the tower but even if you choose not to do the tower it self the view is stunning from the base and the walking trail Also at the top the store of the thousand thousands of locks was interesting We enjoyed it very much and will visit on out next trip to Seoul
4971,5,Well worth a visit if in Seoul A little tough to get to although there are some tourist buses which go up the mountain If not there is a cable car which costs extra There are various places to eat and drink and the view from the top is impressive Allow 2 hours to get there look around and get back down the hill
4972,4,Another nice tower to add to the list Good views over the city nice to go up via the gable car It was not over crowded so we did not have to wait long to enjoy the views from the top there is some more touristy things to see and do around the tower to make the trip worth while easy to reach from central Seoul
4973,4,Though it was already spring the winter chill seem to be in the air and N Seoul Tower was enveloped with clouds The down side was that we didint fully appreciate the city view But we did enjoy the feeling of being in the clouds except for the chilling cold Aside from the viewing deck there are also restaurants and souvenir shops at N Seoul Tower as well as other attractions such as the teddy bear museum It was there where I tasted the best burger in Seoul and it was indeed delicious  We visited N Seoul Tower through the Seoul City Tour Bus Just be ready to do a short hike to the tower
4974,4,the tower is a great place to to get an over all view of the city The mens room is right out of Star Trek you will not believe your eyes amazing loads of fun
4975,4,Great place to go for a first time visitor Try to go on a weekday because weekends are packed Found the ticket and dinner package was good value Amazing view at night
4976,3,Rather than a bus or cable car we decide to hike to the top It looked far but the path was clearly marked and was easy to do We walked from Myeondong with just the normal turist map as our guide
4977,3,I dont get how can it be that so many people give 5 stars to this Its just a tower  I much rather spend my time having a nice walk at the park where the tower is You can also see the city from there The tower would probably be nice for children though And of course its nice to see it if you anyway are walking in the park We were during a daytime maybe eveningsunset would be better
4978,5,Picture perfect location great views of the city and the nearby mountains Wonderful sunset views Lovers hang out spot
4979,4,Missed this attraction fm my last trip so was very determined to go this round We were misinformed at the concierge of our hotel that this place is walkable from the hotel I should have stucked to my own research findings and not trust the reception Although a short walk getting to the cable station was a sharp steep walk Was totally out of breath when we reached the station The best way to get there is by taxi as it wont cost a lot It will save you a lot of leg power If you really want to walk we found out too late there is a much easier way I dont have the road names ready but I will try to give adequate directions From Myeondong shopping are head towards Migliore dept store and turn right on the main road Think is is called Namsandong Walk towards Shinsaegae dept store near Namdaemun market Before reaching Shinsaegae turn left a big road so you cant miss it Walk on for 5 minutes uphill and you will come to a lift special lift just to bring passengers up to Namsan Cable car station It is free and is so easy rather than walking uphill like what we didat the cable car station a return ticket is KRW8000 per pax Need a 10 min wait for each cable car to arrive It was worth the wait as we got down at the foot of NSeoul Tower Plenty of activities as there were some shows going on changing of guards Can take pictures with the guards After a few flight of steps you will be at the big courtyard where you can buy tickets up to the observatory deck or go into the restaurants in the tower We wondered around the open areas and were fascinated with the many colourful locks for sweethearts and couple seatsyou need to see this and try it outcool The shops on the ground floor are so pretty and captivating that we forgot all about going up the observatory deck KRW9000 entrance fees and shopped there for nearly 45 minutes choosing all the cute stuff sold there All in all it was worth our while albeit the tough walk
4980,5,This is near our guesthouse and we just walked up the hill We enjoyed our tour of the place The Teddy bear museum is nice My daughter loves the place
4981,5,This is one must see attraction of Seoul on a sunny day If visibility is poo please avoid it The hill around it is very nice Overall a great experience
4982,4,This is iconic in Seoul as it gives an amazing view of the city from the observation deck Someone was creative enough to show a video on the ceiling of the elevator so no one gets bored waiting for the inevitable ding to happen Its best to go when its a clear night It gives such a spectacular view of the city There are several attractions you will find at the tower What you will notice is that almost all of it has love themes N Tower is apparently considered a date place by locals That would explain the love notes at the lower level of the observation deck and the love locks at the bottom of the tower I thought it was cute Its still very familyoriented though You can still visit with friends or solo but be prepared for the abundance of couples
4983,4,If youfre visiting the city dont miss out on the Seoul Tower A cable car ride to the top offers some excellent views of the city  Having visited after dark I think this offers a better overall experience that if it was daytime  The venue was busy but not over crowded and the waiting times for the cable car and the lift up and down the tower were resonable On site there are plenty of food  drink facilities which I did not try personally but were popular with other visitors  Dont miss this one
4984,4,N Seoul Tower is a very nice spot to see the whole town of Seoul from above Its good to visit both day  night But the best period is late afternoon and stay long until night time so you can see both scenery of Seoul  day  night  If the weather is not good Foggy day  rainy day its O to walk around the terrace  locks of love no need to pay for the ticket to go up to the tower cuz you also cant see anything clearly
4985,4,Its beauty and the coordinates and distances of different countries on the tower the climb in the elevator is also marvelous
4986,5,I enjoyed everything about it Amazing views Make sure you take the cable car all the way to the top it is worth it If you are limited in walking there are a lot of steps so you may want to reconsider before you try all the steps
4987,4,Be sure to buy tickets to the top and go see the views all across Seoul We took the city busit was a pretty nerve wracking ride as you wind up a hill and a lot of the turns are over the side of the hill so if the bus tumbles youre gone The views were nice from up top at nightyou can see all of the buildings lit up etc
4988,5,I went there during night time for my first visit and its lovely the climb to the top is steep but its better than taking the cable car Take the bus 2 near Chumurong station
4989,5,If you come to Seoul need to visit this Iconic Place in Seoul With a very high Tower  so you can see the whole Seoul from there And also theres Teddy Bear Museum below  Very romantic Place
4990,4,A great view Flats and units as far as the eye can see Very clean and organised Had to wait for the first cable car to go up
4991,5,Its a great place to visit with your loved one great view of the city fresh air to relax or just to get clear of stresses there is a padlock love wishes you can actually purchase one there if you dont bring any alot of restaurant and cafes up there If youvplan to go there try look for sunny day you will be amazed and there is actually easier way to go up there by a elevator just behind the road you can save energy to go up Since taking a hike up to the cable car station would be a little bit exercises It can be very crowded especially in valentine day  Must visit the tower if you had a chances
4992,5,I go there on afternoon to cacth a sunset it was a beautiful sunset everso many couple there it was the romantic scene of the tower you can see the city of seoul also through the tower very unforgetfull moment there
4993,1,I cant believe how expensive it was to wait in line Definitely do not use the cable car if curiosity leads you here The wait is long the distance short and the cable car itself reminded me of a cattle truck with dozens of people pushed inside each car
4994,4,We were blown away from the views in the Seoul Tower you can see how huge Seoul is Would definitely recommend going up if you only have limited time in Seoul
4995,4,Excellent view of Seoul from the tower site however the tour bus will drop you about 350 meters from the tower with a very steep hill to climb Once you have navigated the hill you will be richly rewarded with an excellent 360 degree view of the city
4996,3,This was an OK side trip and would have been nicer on a clear day I took the cable car up and even with the haze got a good view of the city A round trip was 8000 Won I chose not to spend another 9000 Won to go up in the tower as it did not seem like I would of had much better of a view given the weather conditions Under the tower they were having a demostration with traditional music weapons and martial arts which was interesting to see
4997,4,I took the Seoul City Tour at night the bus leaves everyday at 8 pm besides Monday They stop at a stop for 1015 minutes for us to take pictures for Seoul Tower It is really pretty at night as it lights up by different colors
4998,5,Love the beautiful scenery on the way up on the cable car The night view from the Tower is indeed a beautiful sight The pad lock area is indeed a beautiful sight The teddy bear museum is actually only a miniature one unlike the one in Jeju Island Would prefer the one in Jeju better
4999,4,On my second visit to the Seoul Tower I was thrilled to be able to ride the Cable Car to the base of the tower And you can take an incline from the street to the cable car as well You have to navigate some steps after you exit the cable car to reach the tower but the ride is worth the effort Great views of Seoul from the top just an impossibly HUGE city Such an awesome tower and the grounds around the tower are beautiful Must do if in Seoul and especially at night
5000,5,I have been to the Sears Tower and the Empire State Building but Seoul Tower is the best view The tower is not that tall but they put it on top of a mountain so the view is amazing Couple of good restaurants that are really not that pricey Great time and will be back soon
5001,5,Indeed a must visit when in Seoul Beautiful view especially at night The cable car ride uphill was great Loved the love padlock area Very unique
5002,4,The namsan tower is a landmark in seoul as it actually a communication and baervation tower located on Namsan mountain in central seoul  Wherever you go around the city you will always get a glimpse of the tower they say it measures 2367m in height and tops out at 4797m above sea level To get up to this point many visitors are the cable car ride while some drive it up halfway and walk it all the way up to the base where you will find a gift shop and some restaurants n the ground level One interesting reason to visit this place aside from the panoramic vistas is to see millions of padlocks symbolising friendship and love that are hanging in every nook and cranny creating a massive chain of padlocks Even the locals frequent this place and if you do visit with your special someone or partner might as well hang one for yourself
5003,5,I went there with my mom I suggest you to go there by bus otherwise you have to walk from to the hill which is around 8001 km Seoul tower in winter was sooo windy and cold
5004,4,The uphill to the tower will be really tiring the tower itself is unique but up inside the tower there is really nothing special just windows where you can look around seoul up high
5005,4,The namsan tower is a landmark in seoul as it actually a communication and baervation tower located on Namsan mountain in central seoul  Wherever you go around the city you will always get a glimpse of the tower they say it measures 2367m in height and tops out at 4797m above sea level To get up to this point many visitors are the cable car ride while some drive it up halfway and walk it all the way up to the base where you will find a gift shop and some restaurants n the ground level One interesting reason to visit this place aside from the panoramic vistas is to see millions of padlocks symbolising friendship and love that are hanging in every nook and cranny creating a massive chain of padlocks Even the locals frequent this place and if you do visit with your special someone or partner might as well hang one for yourself
5006,4,A must see site in Seoul We visited the site in a slighthazy morning and enjoyed the breathtaking views We got to know that on a clear day the view extends to a long distance and the view of the glitterring city is just marvellous at night Will definitely return again at night on my next tour to Seoul  The teddy bear museum takes a while but is interesting Dont miss out to take a snap at the Love Lock location on exiting the tower
5007,4,It really takes the the breath from you because of the walk from the parking area to the tower is really steep The view though is great It is similar to being in Hong Kongs Victoria Peak plus you can go up the tower
5008,4,The day we decided to visit tower was hazy so we decided no to go inside however we enjoyed our time and the view was good
5009,4,Catch the cable car up Namsan mountain from near myeongdong On the day we were there it was cloudysmoggy so it wasnt really worth paying to go up the tower Instead the viewing platforms provide a high view over Seoul and the city is HUGE Lots of places to eat and drink in and around the tower including one cafe with a cool viewing area Take a padlock if you want to join the padlocks love section
5010,4,the view from the top of tower is just good but is not so much different than any towers in other cities ive ever climbed up However the tower itself is amazing One of romantic places for couples near the tower there is aplace where hundreds of keys on which people wrote love letter  which means that their love never part clinging the walls Very nice to enjoy its exotic atmosphere
5011,4,costs about 10USD entrance to go up the tower can be reached via a 5min cable car ride another 8USD
5012,5,Hand in Hand with your honey bunny get ready to stroll around a fine park just to be facetoface with this amazing tower Take time to check the padlockhedge and the beautiful benches Really well run I feel like coming back Deifnitely
5013,3,We didnt really find out if we could go up but the area around this tower is great I guess this is the same place as Namsan Tower am I wrong
5014,5,this is a structure similar to Seattles space needle and provides for unique views of the city It costs between 1020 dollars to travel to the top of the tower depending on size of the group and what package you get Lots of photo ops at the observation deck and souveniers as well dont let the walk up the hill keep you from visiting the tower
5015,4,Located in Nansan district we took the cable car it only took about 10 minute from station to the Nanshan Tower very convenient and nice view Installation of more escalators should be better for tourists especially for elderly
5016,5,We went there in the daytime We took the Cable Car to the Tower This tower gives you a fantastic view of Seoul
5017,5,The N Seoul Tower is located at the top of Namsan Park and is accessible via cable car or bus There is a fee for entering and you can also purchase a combo ticket to enter the Teddy Bear museum located at the ground floor of the tower Outside you can find the love locks trees
5018,5,It was how it was shown in Boys over Flowers very romantic The place also has a nice coffee shop The best was sipping hot coffee and feeling the cold winter breeze in your face The place was really awesome 
5019,3,The Seoul Tower is cool to see as well as the Locks of Love The tram ride up to the tower has a really good view of the city You can also eat in the restaurants in the tower and get a really good view Its really beautiful at night with the blue lights
5020,4,Ditch the cable car if your up for hiking up through Namsan Park Awesome view of Seoul when you go up the N Seoul tower Great restaurants over there
5021,5,This was a really cool experience the cable car is a must and you must stop to see the love padlocks there are thousends up there the views are amazing I went when it was snowing very cool 
5022,5,its well worth to walk up or even take the gondola to the base of the tower enjoy the view all around as well as signs how far it is to your home
5023,4,We took the cable car up and braved the subzero winds to be rewarded with an amazing view of the Seoul skyline Caught the last sunset of 2012 here This is where couples come with locks as a symbol of their love and tie it to the fence It looks really cute Bring your own locks if you dont wanna be ripped off up here I didnt go up the tower itself as the view was good enough at the observation deck
5024,5,The view of the Seoul metropolitan area from the tower was incredible It is THE way to get a feel for the enormity of the metroploitan area
5025,3,went at night in Jan 13 took a bus from chungmuro station to the N Seoul Tower teddy bear museum is quite okay as you can take alot of pictures but the observation tower is so so very crowded and i think there is nothing much to view with the fog in winter
5026,5,The cable car is walking distance from the Myeongdong area Worth a visit to see a nice view of the city
5027,4,This is a nice thing to do if youre into good views There are touristy restaurant at the viewing level Book the better upper priced restaurants in advance Very busy even in December Lots of stairs Worth the effort especially at night
5028,4,i like the scenery and the technology of the area it not so pleasant for incapable person to travel there cabel car were only can be take when going down of the park
5029,5,Going up to the top of this tower and seeing Seoul at night is similar to going up the Eiffel Tower to see Paris at night  all the city lights are amazingalso like the Eiffel Tower as you walk around the top to see the view they have all the cities labeled on the windows so when you face North South East or West  you know what cities you are facing per that direction
5030,4,Nice view of the city from the top You get a very different perspective of Seoul from there as you will realise that the town is actually quite hilly  The kids loved the teddy bear museum at the bottom with all the different daily scenarios in olden times
5031,4,In a country not many speaks english we took the taxi from Myeongdong to the N tower Little did we know that a short stroll up the hill through an alley would get us there quicker Well only the cable cars you can walk up to the N tower but I recommend the catching the cable car runs every 15 mins and check out the view of Seoul  We went there at 8pm at night on a very cold winters night but the city skyline and the various colours the N tower all made the trip worth while it was 11 degrees but that didnt stop me from taking photos out in the cold and well worth it all  If youre a romantic there is also fences at the lookout where you can lock away your love for your partner Dont worry there is a shop that sells locks and pens in case you didnt bring one  For the N tower it has a great 360 view of Seoul dont try using a flash to take a picture as the window will kill off a great night sky
5032,4,Its like CN Tower in Toronto or VIctoria Peak in Hong Kong a homework you have to do when you arrive at a new city Tourist trap Yes But you get a feel for the entire city from the above which is quite special  The height of the tower itself is actually much less than CN Tower Much of the elevation comes from the mountain There are some shops cafes and restaurants near the tower entrance but I would not recommend When we went on top Seoul was all white with snow which was quite a sight  After coming down from the tower we headed to Grand Hyatt nearby 10 minutes by car which had a very lively night scene with a fabulous lobby I highly recommend going to the Grand Hyatt for a drink after you saw the tower
5033,4,We were here near to sunset and it was nice with the surroundings beaming in the last burst of sunlight My girl enjoyed the view up there and we also visited the bear museum which was housed here
5034,4,As most city towers this one offers a great view in Seoul However dont try it in bad weather A teddy bear museum inside the tower
5035,5,Teddy Bear Museum and Christmas decoration is awesome We took a cable car to the Seoul Tower and the kids are thrilled
5036,4,Walking up to the cable car station from Myeong Dong side was very pleasant Where Pacific Hotel is you are supposed to turn right We went left instead so it was a much longer walk However the path brought us into contact with some very quaint shops and cafes along the way N Seoul Tower was great to get an overview of Seoul The cafe outside served awesome waffles
5037,5,This tower is reached by a steep 20 minwalk from Myeongdong up to a cable car It is posssible to take a taxiThe cable car connects directly up to the base of the tower but It is possible to walk up a path through a park area The views from the top of the tower are superb offering a 360 degree view of the city of Seoul A snack bar and restaurant are in the tower
5038,4,The peak in Hong Kong bests the view that one gets of the city vis a vis the N Seoul Tower but I just like the greenery the one sees on the way to the top The autumnwinter cusp also made everything so beautiful
5039,4,Had a nice cablecar ride up from to the top where theres Seoul Tower a Teddy Bear Museum and a place where lovers locked their locks Splendid night view where the streets looked like symbolic arteries and veins that transport the people throughout Seoul
5040,4,you cant see much The employees go around and scrape off the ice but they dont seemed to bothered to rush it which they should be given that I paid 16000 to get there and back Long lines at every point cable car and elevator there and back but the elevator does have a video that shoots you into space and then brings you back to Seoul
5041,4,Very fast and efficient service for both the cable car and the tower Go for a viewing at sunset to be able to see the city in daylight and at night There was a 10 discount voucher for Tower admission in our TMoney card box
5042,5,When i was in seoul ive been there two times i love the scenery and i would to visit there again if i come to seoul must visit place
5043,3,Well it is a tower The view on the city was not that good when I was there because of the fog And Seoul does not have a crazy skyline
5044,5,We were here on 11 December enjoyed the scenic walk upslope towards the N Seoul Tower The sidewalks were capped with snow There was a brief kungfu type of performance at the ground flour before we ventured to the top of the tower for the amazing views of Seoul The toilets at the top of the tower are a must visit it offers panoramic views of the city at the wash sink areas
5045,3,Visited this place on our last day and we should have went somewhere else  If you are not ready for a long walk and not familiar going here and back to the subway I dont think you should try the place
5046,5,We went to Seoul for 3 days and joined a night tour bus first I didnt expect anything because we were so tired from the tripwhen we get there the tour guide told us that the bus can only go up to a particular place and we need to walk for 10 mins Up to the tower its was October and was very cold but we were enjoying the view even just from below its clean and peaceful at night If you are couple its a must go place in Seoul When we arrived at the top of the hill where the tower is we thought we have to wait for long but even theres a lot of people it goes so smooth that it only took us 10 mins In the line for the elevator to go up The elevator was so cool and when we got to the top the view was breath taking its like a gold that shines so bright and the glass of the tower has the direction and name of every countries that we found interesting and looked for our country to take a picture The souvenirs and photos are kinda expensive but the view are awesome When you go to Seoul this is the place to visit even just once
5047,4,The N Seoul Tower is not very high or particularly stunning however the scenery and background around it make it very nice It is surrounded by greenery rather than other buildingsskyscrapers I went up the cable just before sunset and left right after sunset so I got the best of both worlds in terms of taking pictures during the day vs night There is the option to go up the observatory but the locals were telling me that you can get great shots just by staying at the base On a nice day you can get a good workout by hiking up instead of taking the cable car
5048,3,We took the bus to the tower as the cable car can have long queues and is quite expensive The Teddy Bear Museum is worth a look only if you have kids with you Adults might get bored We did not go to the top of the tower due to the tickets and the long lines We did enjoy the cool weather and the scenery in the area
5049,4,Went during the Dec winter period around 4 plus The sight was beautiful Of cos it was freezing as well There is a beacon lighting ceremony but depending on the weather You can take the cable car here round trip cost 8000 krw Feels its more worth to hike up but thats a long walk
5050,3,My visit was on August 2012 was really disappointed because of the Foggy weather Was not able to take a lot of good pics on the Tower
5051,4,We went up and had Dinner at the restaurant above the viewing gallery and it was GOOD The views of the city were fantastic too  Definitely a must try and highly recommended   The only downside was the queue to get down the Tower and then the Q to take the cable car down the hill 
5052,5,We went here after we checkedin in Namsan Guest house We walked from our guest house It was quite tiring because literally we walked in a very steep road just to get to the namsan cable car to get to the tower It was sunset and the view of Seoul from the park outside the tower was so fantastic and we were able to see the famous love padlocks We went to the observatory first We get to see the Seouls night view and it was good It was crowded at that time because there were lot of Japanese RICH High school students were there for their field trip Am I in Tokyo I asked myselfhaha  Overall it was great  Nice start for our 5days stay in Seoul   TIP TRY THE CHURROS after you exit the tower We really like it
5053,5,The road to the N Seoul Tower is really tiring but when it was there the landscape is changing very beautiful
5054,4,Smoking is ban around Nam San Park and the Tower So you truly get a lot of fresh air but you still cant escape from the throngs of visitors to this place I was there before 10 am and there were already bus load of people Left without going up the tower when the crowd starts to build up
5055,4,Getting to the Seoul Tower is something of an adventure in itself  I had no problem following the online directions to take the subway stop and walk through the commercial district past restaurants and things and take some stairs and walk along the street to the cable car which was an interesting trip in itself You can also get there by bus which would be preferable if you have a problem with heights  Once the cable car lets you off up on the mountain you could walk over to the tower itself or you could explore the mountain which has a big park and an outdoor pavilion area where they were doing some kind of cultural display when I was there and who knows what else There are also food vendors coffee and other stuff like that  So far you could do all this for free because you can just hike up the mountain if you want and once there you dont have to pay for anything else unless you want to experience the observation decks or the restaurant in the tower itself We decided to go ahead and pay to go up to the observation deck because it doesnt really cost that much and it was a weekday so it wasnt very crowded We didnt have to wait in line for anything and we were able to easily take advantage of the bathrooms which have amazing views and are very clean and nice and the coffee shop and restaurant and so on that are on the observation levels One thing we found out is that the restaurant is on a rotating level but the observation level does not rotate so you cant just sit there and see the entire city like I thought I was going to do  In summary the views are amazing and definitely worth it even on a hazy day Yes it can get a little touristy in there and yes the prices at the coffee shop and so on are quite high but it is a tourist attraction after all I considered it to be worth the price of admission I plan on going back on a clear day if possible to eat at the rotating restaurant just so I can enjoy the view of the whole city
5056,2,We came here because it was such a landmark building in Seoul There was nothing special about this place It was just one if those towers for viewing the city The view was not that impressive
5057,5,excellent view of the city and lights at night when youre at the observatory; good itinerary for couples Locks of Love
5058,4,I went during the day but I can see why it would be worthwhile to go at night instead Take the yellow bus up the mountainside If you have read about Seoul and its history ignore the recorded audio tour as it is not worth it
5059,3,Seoul Tower is a cool place to visit with your loved one Make sure to bring a lock It is a hike to reach the tower but worth it for a good city view The admission is not too much There is not much to do but good for a quick stop
5060,4,Found some good views from top The trip by rope way is an excitement too The sun set view from the base of the tower can be really rewarding It is must atleast once
5061,4,Excellent way to see the city Its worth walking up the hill for the views on the way rather than taking a bus The elevator to the top of the observation deck is also an experience
5062,3,We have a hard time finding how to get to this Tower Seriously wasted half day walking and walking Tried to take a cab but the uncle dont understand what is Seoul Tower In the end we use our legs to walk towards the direction of the tower And finally we found a cable car ride to the Tower directly Expensive though  Cablecar is stable even though its packed with people  The view from the top is nice  Quite similar to what weve seen in Taipei 101 Walk a few rounds and came down  Theres a lovers locker just ouside of the gift shop After you purchase your locks and keys walk out of the gift shop and youll see some stairs Go up and this is the place where all the couples wrote their vows or loving messages for each other and lock them up on the fences
5063,5,I took the Namsan cable car up and you cant believe how great the autumn sunset view is Photos can never do it any justice you will have to experience it for real It can get really chilly too so bringing along some heat pad will be very useful  I took the Observatory and Teddy Bear Museum package and I really love this experience  If you are a teddy bear lover you will surely love the museum It actually tells you some history of Korea but if youre not a history person the bears can really keep you entertain too You will have to go through the museum I and II first before going up to the observatory  As for the observatory its a pretty nice experience going up the lift and watching this video effect View from the observatory is really good and you can send out post card from the high tower I visited during the sunset so its really nice and if you hang around for a while more you can see the night scene too You can buy lock or tiles to leave love message if you are going as a couple Great place for dating but also good for families and others
5064,3,The tower lets you see Seoul from a high vantage point Perfect sights when you visit at night  This is also the same location where the Locks of Love are located Sweet
5065,4,Beautiful view of Seouk from N Seoul Tower Take the cable car to get there I was there during sunset and it made it even more beautiful and magical There are love locks for couples too love locks are so common in Korea anyway but how it is set makes it very romantic even for a single person like me lol
5066,4,The Namsan Seoul Tower provides excellent views of the city Although I wasnt too interested in the teddy bear museum I enjoyed my visit there
5067,3,Lots of stairs to climb even when taking tram to top View at night only seeing city lights Day time would be better Cost 6000 won for tram and 10000 won to go up tower
5068,5,Great way to get a view for the size of Seoul Buildings as far as the eye can see The audio tour is hard to follow No idea what it is they refer to
5069,3,Liked the bear museum n the view but a little too crowded Not convenient by public transport need to take a bus up and walked up a steep slope
5070,5,Although this was my first stop in Seoul I knew itd be my favorite as soon as I stepped onto the grounds And after 3 days in Seoul I was right  Youd be hard pressed to find a lovelier urban setting than Seoul So its a special treat to view that from high above  Most guests will arrive at the base of the Tower on the tram So bear in mind that youd need to pay the tram fee and the Tower entrance fee For people in decent shape I suggest paying only for the oneway tram fee since the walk down is easy and picturesque  Even if you dont decide to go up the Tower the base provides magnificent views Its hard not to get a tad emotional at the beauty of the area This was especially true as I visited in October with the leaves changing colors
5071,5,Been to the Tower in the afternoon  so this time I decided to brave the cold winds to see Seoul in the evening  and boy was the trip was worth it  The tower gives you an un obstructed view of Seoul Given the chance I would visit and bring friends to marvel at the views 
5072,5,You will spot a lot of locks here and beautiful view too You need not to pay the ticket and you can freely explore there Locks are all displayed for you to take pictures and of cos the cool view especially on sunset 3 Anyway you will be require to climb a little bit to reach the tower 
5073,4,You can take a shuttle bus up to the tower but walking up the fairly steep mountains through wooded paths is great exercise and the natural environment is nice  The vista from the top of the tower is incredible although often hazy
5074,4,I was there both day and night but only went up the tower at night I was fortunate it was a clear night I came by way of Namsan cable car and there was a 2030min wait and this was a few hours before closing time lots of visitors The second time was on the city tour bus but you have a climb ahead of you from the bus stop Come to think of it there was a climb to from the cable car Oh well The view is worth it either way for me anyway 
5075,3,A trip to Seoul is not complete without going to the tower The view is great suggest you go at night but there is nothing much to do once youre there
5076,5,Ive been here twice and I love it Its good value for money The views of Seoul are wonderful and I really loved the ride in the cable car
5077,4,The restaurant on the tower offers the panoramic view of the city revolving around on top floor
5078,5,Have visited N Seoul Tower now 3 times and everytime has been a fantastic experience The views across Seoul are amazing It has become busier and pricier attraction over the years but for anyone visiting Seoul its a must
5079,4,The tower itself is already beautiful at night but the view from the top even more so Before going up they take a photo of you in front of a green background which they replace with the tower you can buy the daynight photos for 12k won The elevators have amusing scifilike mini galaxytravelling videos on their ceilings At the top there is a bar a restaurant and a gift shop To take nice pictures you will probably need to block reflecting light with your handsclothes The same views are available even from at least male toilets
5080,4,After a long hike up the road from the hotel we got there right before sunset and were there when the lights went on Beautiful time for picture taking
5081,4,The last time I went was in evening and saw sunset and night view This time round I went in the morning and had a different experience The crowd was younger with school children and folks who walked up the mountain for exercise I had the chance to see the love locks and the signs that warned people about not throwing the keys off the mountain Kinda funny since that was the whole purpose There is this burger pace where the steps are and they call themselves as having the best burger but not really  The toilet up in the tower is worth a visit Never will you feel this bliss when doing your business
5082,4,The price is 9000 won per person around 8usd is very good place if you have time go there And take the cable car
5083,5,A great view of the city in either day or night Especially romantic on Valentines Day and take a lock with both of your initials to place on the fence and throw away the key
5084,5,By day and by night this is a must do item on your Seoul trip You get great views of the region and a great ride down on a cable car
5085,5,Nice ambient You can see Seoul from here Garden  toilet are clean Must fit as you need to walk quite far Worth your time and energy when you reach the top of the hill
5086,5,A must see in Seoul The place can be romantic at night and even on day time where visitors can see lots of padlocks with love messages and promises The N Tower is also the home of the Teddy bear museum in Seoul
5087,4,The visit to the tower was very enjoyable The uphill walk from the bus stop to the tower itself was serene with a lot of views of the city below The top of the tower was not crowded and offered a 360degree view of Seoul A great place to be for an hour or two
5088,4,My boyfriend then proposed to me here The views are spectacular and the teddy bear museum inside was cool but sometimes creepy too If just for the view I highly recommend it The love locks were something new for me I have never seen so many padlocks in one place but the significance was not lost on me I felt like I was one of the lucky ones to be there
5089,5,What makes this review extra special is that I get to reach the tower by foot  Yes we could have opted to take the cable car by my sweetie is in for a good hike The tired feet is totally ignored the moment you reach the top and witness the breathtaking view of the City You can actually opt to stop by the library and a small cafe before really reaching the top We also passed by the Namsan Park which is also very beautiful It was just very hot though because we decided to climb at 2pm I suggest you guys start climbing very early in the morning to the sun is a bit friendly  Do not forget to bring you camera and sunblocks P Upon reaching the tower youll get souvenir photos of which shows the tower behind you and the other with the huge bear and the tower  which is a really cute souvenir Also I suggest to visit N tower off season so it does not get too crowded  All in all it was a very awesome  romantic and adventurous experience 
5090,4,Its a really tall tower like any other such tower in the world You get good views across the city and surrounding areas If you go with a lover or even if you dont take a padlock with you to lock it to the lowers lock wall at the base of the tower And hey get into shape by walking up the stairs to the tower then take the cable car down  Best time to go Sunset obviously But be prepared for long lines and crowds
5091,3,Because the time I travel getting up to N tower via cable car and back down took 3 hours round trip Only 2 elevators up despite being fastest in the world to the observatory and long lines and process makes this experience terrible I gave a 3 stars because of the 360 view Didnt do it at night but with the window glare probably wont be a good picture spot up there Theres a terrace and lookout spots that you can take pictures for free Steps leading to the N tower from cable car can be steep beware
5092,3,After failing to find the way to it the first day I tried again the next Still had a hard time and ended up meeting a fellow traveller who knew the way If you are out of shape have a heart condition asthma etc take the bus The hike up was really hard I think I almost passed out Once at the halfway point you can take the cable car That was actually pretty nice and you could enjoy nice views over Seoul Once at the top you can walk around the little park area which has benches to rest on Once up to the observatory you can see all of Seoul Overall a nice place to include on your trip but hard time finding and getting to it Although you can see it from almost anywhere in the city
5093,5,Very cool views of Seoul Get ready for a steep walk up once you depart the bus Plan to spend about an hour just walking looking and taking photos of the surrounding area If you have time you can enjoy a cup of tea on the below the observation deck
5094,5,N Seoul Tower is by far my favorite place in Seoul With a stunning view its so romantic It has some history and the cutest Teddy Bear Museum With something for everyone you cant miss it on your trip to Seoul
5095,2,It is the place most new expats visit when they come to Seoul  there are plenty more interesting attractions around such as the Secret Garden in Anguk dong
5096,5,Well worth a visit but make sure you pick a clear day where you will be able to see for miles Got some excellent photos Also outside tower there is thousands of locks and love letters where couples declare their love to one another  very sweet
5097,5,We learnt that we can take a bus from Namdaemun to Seoul Tower  Great experince and this Tower is owesome
5098,4,For a spectacular view of the city and to get a good idea of how huge the city is a visit to the tower is a must There was a long queue for the cable car on the night we visited but the queue moved quite quickly There is a further cost if you want to go up to the viewing platform  find out before you buy that ticket how long you have to wait before you can go up We didnt ask that beforehand and had to wait over an an hour before we could take the lift up to the viewing platform It is worth going up though if you have the time If you are going with a special person take a lock with you and attach with a message to the lock wall for luck and happiness
5099,5,The view at night is the best  I never saw something this beautiful  Seoul by night is really wonderful 
5100,5,Take the cable car lift and enjoy a 360 view of Seoul Very helpful people and reasonably priced Visit the surrounding park for peaceful walks
5101,4,A romantic spot to hang out for courting couples though it can get a bit crowded at night and weekends  Provides a great view of Seoul too
5102,5,love the green and its conveniently located  can choose to go up by foot  cable car  the best is to do both so you get to enjoy the best
5103,4,N Seoul Tower has a lot going for it but the most curiously fun thing about it is that their toilets have great views of Seoul I assure you that this is the best view youll get while relieving yourself  The teddy bear museum at the base of the tower is worth a look as well if you have kids or just have a soft spot for bears showing off the history of South Korea
5104,4,It took us around 10 mins walk from Residence EO to take the cable car to Seoul Tower Good view to enjoy the beautiful scene of Seoul City
5105,5,Wonderful to go at night Looking at beautiful Seoul city lights Better go with your loverspouse because its so romantic 
5106,4,Great view of Seoul but you must go on a clear day At night it is lit up in many changing colors Very beautiful
5107,5,This place has a great view of Seoul City with blue skies and Han river glistening It has the Teddy Bear Museum and a restaurant And seems to be a romantic place with promise locks attached to the fences We also enjoyed free Hanbok wearing experience and a lot of good photo locations We used cable cars both ways
5108,4,Expensive Cable car to get to the top was expensive but it was worth it for the experience Entrance to the towerteddy bear museum to me were also expensive  But the view of Seoul from the tower at night was great The lights of the tower were nice too It was tiring to get here though as it was uphill From Myeongdong at around 7pm we walked all the way to the cable car station We waited for around 1015minutes for the cable car once we got on the foot of the tower the line to go to the top was long And so was the line going back down But it was really a great experience and memorable to finally be there  By the way the comfort room from the tower also has a great view of Seoul
5109,4,Offers a good view of Seoul Best to go up around evening time where you can see the day view and evening city lights
5110,3,Dislike as we need to clim up the hill and we reached up the Tower the wheather is cloudy and we cant see nice view of Korea townFees is reasoneable as we can get discount for both Seoul Tower ride and bear mesuem
5111,4,Beautiful view souvenirs very expensive nice walking if you like Mtountain climibing Cable car is the best option
5112,4,Really a standard tourist thing to do but worth it You get a great view of the city especially from the mens roomyoull understand when you see Just make sure its good weather when you go Also the restaurant at the top was pretty good
5113,5,Very nice experience the views are great and can see Seoul Went at day time was ok but night might be better Walking around the tower is also nice many things to look around specially the love locks they really have a lot of them some are in English so you can read the message To get to the tower I took the cable car it is a nice experience
5114,5,One of the most romantic place in Seoul and the best way to see the lights of Seoul at Night  Beware if you go there around 8pm the place is crowded and you will have to wait at least 30 min for the cable car if you are coming by the cable car  My advice go there at 6pm if you can take a ticket to go on the top of the tower and enjoy the sunset  If you are a couple you can leave a padlock outside the tower They are selling padlocks in the shop at the bottom of the tower
5115,4,Keep in mind lines may be long at both the cable car to get up Namsan and for the elevator in the tower So be sure to include adequate time to either walk up the hill or to wait in line
5116,2,Its nothing special just a good view of Seoul And you have paid money for entrance ticket just for view
5117,3,The whole thing is a little hokey but there are great views so it is worthwhile if you can find a clear day
5118,5,Really nice view and restaurant Spend some time there relaxing and enjoying the view Wasnt too crowded as well
5119,4,If you want to see Seoul in all it splendor you really have to visit the Tower Set inside a park you must be warned that there is a rather steep walk to the actual tower
5120,3,this tower is a good place to see the whole town of seoul from the top they have lift for us to get into the top and they sell souvenirs as well in this area furthermore there are a lot of messages thay had been keylocks outside the tower for young people to get message for their lover it is quite entertaining and unique but we need to hike from the parking area to get into the outside of the tower and i dont think old people can do this because it is so dangerous and quite a long way
5121,3,The tower is located at the top of the Namsam Park and is visible from every place in Seoul On top you will find shops and cafeterias Inside the tower you can have lunch or dinner However the sight is mostly the same you can experience from the park
5122,5,Avoid on weekends Too crowded massive crowds Try walking up instead of taking the cable car Beautiful views by day and night shoudl defo be on your itinnary
5123,4,The tower is quite small it only takes a few minutes to walk around but its good to have a coffee and some snacks to enjoy the view of seoul
5124,3,I went with a group of 7 friends during the day time The ride up to the towers was a bit cramped and hot But once up there the views are amazing I think if we had went at night it would have been better to see all the lights in Seoul I would recommend seeing it at least once but make sure you go at night especially for couples
5125,5,It is good place to view the sunset The air here is cool The night view of Seoul is spectacular from the peak
5126,4,Gorgeous setting especially for photography visit during Spring time is cooling and comforting pad lock area is definitely lovers corner souvenirs are appropriately priced not many other stores but good for strolling and picture taking
5127,5,We went there a night time the view is amazing and the padlock really nice to see really a great place to go
5128,4,Great panoramic view of Seoul If the windows were cleaner Id have got some awesome shots Fun place for whiling time Also has a great restaurant at the base black interiors cant recall the name
5129,3,It offers Bird eye view of the whole Seoul city Was there too early before eveningwe waited for the evening lights for photographybut was disappointed as It became so Crowded in evening and we have great difficult to get a complete empty spot for photo shooting Nothing much other than jus photo shooting But I enjoyed sharing and locked my lover lock together with millions of others there in the Lovers Lock corner
5130,5,My second visit to N Seoul Tower is doubly exciting than the first one since this time I visited it at night Lights around the tower are amazing And since its April weather was really cold I believe it was 2 degrees celcius Really had a great time
5131,5,This is the right spot to view Seoul from top You can reach the top using stairs walking the road car bus or teleferic Cable Car
5132,4,This tower is best for couples You can bring or buy love lock there and put it to the fence as a symbol of securing your love The scenery from there is beautiful but the tower is not really high and nothing really special about it
5133,3,The N Seoul Tower is a nice attraction in Seoul but only go if you have some extra time Night time is a great time to go its great to see the whole city lite up Sunset is also a good time as you can see the city in the daylight and the night time Although it is only worth the trip up if it is a clear day Be prepared to wait in line for the cable car if you dont want to walk all the way to the top You will also have to wait in line to get back down seeing as though you must take the elevator to get back down  Its fun to go but like I said only go if you have some extra time in Seoul there are plenty of other great sites in Seoul
5134,5,Within all the places I visited in Seoul N Seoul Tower is the one I like best You should go there in the evening
5135,4,Unlike Towers like in Paris  Tokyo  N Seol Tower is on a Hill having a good view of the city and fantastic greenery around  We were hungry at 8PM after our view  and could not have vegetarian food and all the eating places were closed  I suggest to have one or two restaurants open at the top to have leisurely enjoyable evening with food and drinks
5136,5,We went to Seoul Tower by riding the cable car it was a great view from up there on mount namsan we got to visit the lock balcony at the feet of the tower and it was soo exciting since it was where we wanted to go in seoul
5137,4,If you want stunning views of Seoul this is the place for you The tower and the surrounding plaza is great for sightseeing or just a day to sit out and relax On the day we went there was actually a demonstration of Joseonera swordsmanship which drew a big crowd of people already at the tower  Also be sure to bring a padlock and add it to the walls and installations featuring padlocks with messages and wishes written on them  We planned on only visiting the tower but once we were there and looking out across the city and below we regretted not exploring Namsan Park as well Best way to get up to the tower is by the Namsan Cable Car or if you want to spend the whole day at the huge park which I would love to do next time you can take a hike up  Theres plenty of food options and souvenir shops as well if youre looking for some
5138,4,Liked  the excellent views of the whole of Seoul Disliked  the pushy staff and being treated like a herd of cattle
5139,5,The best way to get to North Seoul Tower is to ride the cable car up taking in the view of Seoul descending below you There is a steep hill to walk from the cable car to the foot of the tower  not suitable for the elderly or wheelchair users At the foot of the tower there are locks of love  padlocks signed and locked to the gates by thousands of couples There is also a pretty pagoda to sit under and people watch or just to catch your breath from the walk I timed my visit so that I went up the tower at dusk and watched the sun set over Seoul
5140,5,Love the aerial view of Seoul City 360 degs and you see all of Seoul Good to go during the evening so you can see and capture pics of the day adn night view of Seoul Beautiful adn moneys worth going up Seoul Tower for visit
5141,5,Great and Chill experience here on top of the City with lots of activities Teddy Bear Museum Love LOCK thing Cable car i like 
5142,4,The view from the very top of this communication tower is really impressive If the weather obliges Seoul can get really fogged in at times its definitely worth it
5143,5,Loved the cable car stairs and ride up; wellkept grounds and shops at the top I did not like the cheezey video in the elevator that the attendant insisted we watch  she barked at a member of our group to look up and watch it after she had made it clear it made her dizzy Trust us to make our own decisions The locks and hearts of couples was fun and the park at the base a nice place to spend a cool couple of hours Go early enough 56pm ishso lines are less for the dark night sky viewing Large steps up and down from cable care to park base so workin the calf muscles and the knees Be careful I did not go to the Teddy Bear Museum so have no opinion Burger bar inside the tower had awesome hamburgers Pricey at 7 but we splurged as it was 4th of July
5144,2,The airconditioning system is poor on the top floor Especially when it was flooded with tourists
5145,4,we found the perfect weather to visit the tower in the late afternoon Sun was still out at 7pm Nice place to hang out with lots of restaurants to choose from Our family debated whether to eat at the revolving restaurants and decided not to But overall its worth a visit when the weather cooperates
5146,4,We went up the N Tower after dinner so we would see all the lights The cable car ride up was fun but then we had to wait in line for ages to get up to the top of the tower I paid and extra 3000 to get an audio guide except because we were there so late it was a little hard to find someone to give it to me Having said this I would highly recommend getting an audio guide especially a night when it is hard to make out exactly what everything was it was great to have the information The lights were beautiful and it was lovely and romantic however I think going up on a clear day would be best so you could see more of what was actually below
5147,4,I made it up to Seoul Tower twice while in South Korea I really enjoyed it both times but didnt get to put a lock on the gate ha ha I took the bus both times so I suppose I would try walking the foot path or cable car if i ever went again The bus was fine I recommend going in the late after noon when you can see the view of the city by day You can then stay and enjoy a snack in the cafe and watch the sunset You will be treated to an entirely different scene when you see the city light up for the evening Go with someone who isnt in a rush and who will appreciate the scenery with you This is definitely worth doing once if you are in Korea for a year or more Please be aware that there is an additional cost to go up to the viewing levels of the tower Some friends had paid to take the cable car up to the tower grounds but they then realized they had to by the additional cost to take the elevator up inside the tower In my opinion if you go all the way there you have to go up inside the tower The cost whatever it was did not seem much to me and was worth it The lineups were not bad when I was there either the staff was friendly and the bathrooms were clean Enjoy
5148,4,Enjoy the gigantic view of Seoul with love all around you Dont miss some souvenir from tower
5149,4,pay for the cable car and then again to get to top viewing levelhowever you do get a full view of seoul and is a must do in this town
5150,3,The tower is atop Mt Namsan I went with my 2 female friends seeing that it was a tourist attraction in Seoul and it would give a panoramic view of the city  The conventional way to get up the mountain is to take the cable car shuttle to the tower You can pay the fare with the same card you use to pay the subway fare The trouble was the cable car station is difficult to find especially since we were not local Also cars are not allowed up to the tower so we couldnt hail a cab That day due to strong winds the cable car service was temporarily suspended So we had to take a bus shuttle service up the mountain to the tower Mind you we had to stand the whole ride up the winding mountain road It wasnt very pleasantWe were also really hungry by this time because we thought we could have dinner on the tower When we reached the final bus stop we still had to walk a long way up the mountain steep roads  Unfortunately we didnt anticipate that there would be SO many couples Cue many smooching couplescouples holding hands We felt a little awkward but since we had our own company it wasnt too bad  We chose not to visit the Teddy Bear Museum as we felt it wasnt value for our money  Despite all my troubles it is still worth a visit for the panoramic view of Seoul On a good day it offers a really good view and it is very romantic for couples
5151,4,Leave it to nature and that is what this place is known as no private car is allowed to be driven up except by tour buses Be prepared to walk up the last leg to reach the base of the tower and it can be a challenge for those unfit Take your time if you have them as during peak hour needs to queue to go up the tower and down as well Do not despair if you cannot go right up to the highest top the view from the base of the tower offers unobstructed views as well though not 360 degree The trees fences or whatever that can be chained with locks by lovers to express their love is a charm
5152,5,twas a long walk but was all worth it if youre a couple try to bring a lock and ill see why you need it
5153,3,We visited N Seoul Tower late in the evening of a Sunday around 930 pm so we felt a bit rushed as we toured the place We had to follow a certain call time to be able to go up the observation tower It tends to get crowded in the eveningwe ended up taking the bus both ways up and down Mt Namsan because the line for the cable car was too long
5154,4,Going here lets you see the entire city Even nicer to visit at night when the city lights up Also recommend that you take the Namsan Cable car its worth the 8000 KRW
5155,4,Great place to gain an appreciation of the sprawling nature of Seoul and the air pollution problems that have emerged with their growing population
5156,3,Architecture wise the Pearl Tower is more impressive than the N Seoul Tower The only thing I love was the Teddy Bear Museum beside the tower
5157,5,You cannot afford to miss this beautyit stands elegantlyaffording a birds eye view of the Seoul cityIf time permitshave a cappuccino on the cafe located at the very topYou can also invest in a photo souvenir when you are atop the towerDont forget to miss the Love Wall at the base of the towercovered with locks of all shapes and sizessymbolizing the locked love of millions
5158,5,Seoul is really just thousands of apartment buildings covered in smog Fun when youre on the ground not so great to look at from above
5159,4,Went on a hazy day I wish I could have seen more Also if you like to challenge yourself walk down If you feel brave walk up
5160,3,We took the bus to a stones throw of the tower went in and paid the admission fee of 9000 W per person roughly 9 USD They offered a big bucket of popcorn and two soft drinks for an extra 2000 W so that was nice Then we waiting for our number to be called before taking the elevator up to the top and looked out over the city The view was very pretty it was the daytime so I gather from others at night time it is astounding but the tower was crammed with people with no outside observatory I think we spent about 20 minutes up there before going back outside  If you visit during the day the deck outside the place to go The view is just as pretty with musicians and the rows upon rows of lovers locks Bring your own lock if you want to leave one there surprisingly I didnt see any of the vendors selling them
5161,4,Beautiful view But really crowded in the evenings
5162,5,Amazing view over a huge city well worth the time and money
5163,3,You should time your visit during the sunset so that you still have a little natural light with the neon lights  better for dummy photography Nothing much really  some cafesrestaurants Teddy Bear Museum shops
5164,4,Excellent location can be very crowded in the evening Lots of place to hang around
5165,4,I thought it was cute how you could buy a tile and write anything you wanted on them they place it on there wall for i think up to a year Lots of couples go there you can say it gets romantic there
5166,3,lots of petlocksthousands or millions quite a distance uphill walk from Myeongdong st to the cable car st i feel it was just a journey to the top and for phototaking at the petlocks trees  sunset N Seoul Tower landmark recommended once only unless you already make a lifelong promises of love here 
5167,3,There is a hill which you can climb to get a slightly better view of Seoul Now they put a tower on the top and a cableway up the hill Very contrived all the way And on the day we visited it was hazy I am not sure that I could recommend this
5168,4,This is known to be the geographical center of Seoul It was amazing how wellmaintained the place was There are a lot of things to do and see The Teddy Bear Museum is also part of this Beautiful trees and flowers
5169,4,It takes a while to get to the top but the views are great 360 degrees of vision
5170,4,top restaurant is great with a splendid view over Seoul especially at night
5171,4,Paved path to the top or you can take a cable car or natural pathway just depending on where you start It takes me about 45 min to go up I like to eat a scone and have a coffee while taking in the views you can also eat at several restaurants then leisurely stroll down about 30 min If you start at the Grand Hyatt in Itaewon you can start your hike in the botanical garden
5172,4,Best attraction in Seoul  especially if you come with a partner
5173,4,It is a place of nature and culture There is also the Teddy Bear Museum Awesome place and nice scenery 
5174,5,Love the views from up here Spent a bit more and go up the tower and use the binoculars We also sent postcards to our folks back at home using the seoul tower love letters arrangement up the tower and it was really nice we got a stamp saying it was sent from N Seoul Tower A very nice personal touch  Staff were very friendly The lift up the tower was really cool experience it to see what I mean  However the stairs from the cablecar station to the tower were quite a killer haha  Please note you need to show ur passport to the guards at the entry if you are taking a taxi to the base of the tower You dont need to show ur passport if you take the cablecar
5175,4,The tram up to N Seoul Tower gives you a nice scenery of all of Seoul Day or night time its a nice short ride up to the tower please note that the tram cost is separate from the tower  Once you get up to the tower there are many restaurants and decks you can view on the lower lever Here you can find the walls of locks There is a teddy bear museum I didnt get a chance to visit this Going up the elevator to the tower was a nice surprise and you should definitely take a look at the bathrooms as well Great view all around 
5176,4,we visited during the night to watch the city skyline during night time the free transport shuttle bus from myeongdong can be very crowded but its worth the shot the elevator going up to the cable car station can be full during the night time as well we were surprised to know that theres a light show that night an extra bonus for our N Seoul Tower visit
5177,5,Been to Seoul 3 times already visited the N Tower twice will suggest to have the buffet at Hancook So you can enjoy the food as well as the beauiful scenary
5178,3,The climb up to the N Seoul Tower is a pleasant ascent through nice gardens in Nasam Park It is a bit steep at times but not overly strenuous Once at the Tower there are a few other things to see within the grounds including the Locks of Love which I thought was better than the view Its a very cool site to see all the locks and messages of love attached to the railings The view from the top of the tower was nice and they point out the direction and distance to other major cities Its a good place to come on a clear day
5179,5,Its a must visit place in Seoul You can have panorama view of the city enjoy the pure natural atmosphere and share wonderful moments with your lovers locking your love locks Ive been here 3 times and I have a love lock here hihi
5180,5,Walking along the walking trail to N Seoul Tower from Namsan Library was tiring but worth it because you can see a very beautiful scenery with fresh air
5181,5,Although it is quite a steep climb to the top of the hill it is worth going up there
5182,5,The view was spectacular and festive like atmosphere because the were boy band performing and some sort of green awareness campaign going on when we arrived Namsan Tower that day
5183,5,If its your first time to go seoul korea this is the place not to miss If travel with kids the teddy bear museum is a must see inside seoul tower Go here afternoon to see all seoul and at night for picture taking with lights
5184,4,it is the only place you can get the view of whole Seoul I reacommed you to be there for the sunset
5185,4,The highest building in Seoul if I remember correctly You could see the whole of Seoul from this building
5186,5,Must visit in the evening Beautiful scenery Try to reach the tower before dusk and you can see the change of skyline and the night scene appearing slowly and glittering away in the dark
5187,4,Good photo for the lock and good scenery when you look from the top
5188,3,I have been to this tower twice the second time is with my family We took the bus to get to the place and the walk from the bus terminals to the tower is exhilarating but very nice experience The discount coupon I got from the Tmoney Plus card is not applicable if you get the combo teddy bear musuem and the NSeoul tower package  The place is a tourist trap everything is expensive including the limited choices of food shops
5189,3,Nothing much to do here unless youre teenager madly in love It was cold and cloudy whe I visited Still the view was nice Other than that you can skip this one
5190,5,Liked the views the cable car trip the restaurants the teddy bear museum and all the locals that enjoy spending a relaxing day here
5191,3,when I visit here there is no cherry blossoms yet around this place so it look like a average park I think it should be better with the Cherry Blossoms this place would be more beautiful
5192,4,It gives a beautiful view of the city It is best if you could visit just before sunset so you could see the city at day and night I think this is also best for couples since they got to hang their love locks and write down love devotions on wooden blocks left on the wall therebesides dropping off love letters to the highest post office in Seoul There are also cafes inside where you can eat And of course the teddy bear museum is fun
5193,4,great view from the observatory yet Tokyo tower is most recommended
5194,5,There are good trails around here and amazing views of the city A must do in Seoul
5195,3,The view was OKit was very very crowded up thereTo get a lift down expect to queue for 45 min to 1 hr Then another queue of 30 min to get into a cable car down the hill
5196,5, Its holiday season so there are a lot of people on weekdays but I still watch parades and love babies Im satisfied with an amusement park this size in Seoul 
5197,4, Rain or shine it is the best amusement facility to enjoy indoors 
5198,4, I went there for my daughters birthday celebration but every time it starts I go in and its close to closing time Its hard but Ive been making fun memories with my daughter 
5199,4, I dont go on Saturdays Sundays public holidays and vacations 
5200,3,Its good for a one time visit The waiting time is too long so I advice to buy the express pass otherwise youll have to wait like 1 hr per game
5201,5, It has been a long time since the children were able to have a good time 
5202,5, You can have such a fun and happy time Its a magical space 
5203,5, When popular attractions are closed be prepared to get out of them Because you will start to be pushed back by unpopular attractions as well 
5204,3, A beautiful and spacious amusement park but the outdoor games were few small space and very crowded 
5205,5, So much fun so many attractions and you can buy an annual membership 
5206,3, August 1st was raining and it was vacation season There were a lot of people from the moment I entered so I had to wait 5 hours to get on the Froom Rider The Magic Pass is very difficult and those who use 
5207,5,I went on Monday but there was a lot of people here This amusement park was divided into 2 zones indoor and outdoor Outdoor playthings was more exciting 
5208,2, Because there were so many people the staff worked really mechanically with a voice wet with inertia Even if you want to ask something you feel like avoiding eye contact as much as 
5209,5, It is better to go on a day when there are not many people The food they sell is delicious 
5210,3,The building and the attractions are great Seems like a plagiarized and cheap version of Disneyland but hey theyre not in Korea Would recommend to spend an overheated summer day Attractions are plenty fun and sensations so trying it 
5211,3, There are so many people but I cant help it but the line was so long that I could only ride two for almost 4 hours 
5212,3, Parking is difficult and there are a lot of people Short ride time 
5213,5, Wednesday and Thursday are the least crowded days As soon as you enter run to French and Atlantis 
5214,5, Can I cancel my annual membership It is difficult to reserve a Magic Pass Gwangkle required 
5215,5, Its been a while since Ive been here but I felt a strange nostalgia I dont have that thrilling feeling when I was young but it was so much fun 
5216,5, Is it possible for only one accompanying person to board the disabled child The rides can accommodate up to 6 people but if the number of people on board is not exceeded all family members of 4 should board first 
5217,3, Huge queues are long few extreme ones I liked the other park more 
5218,5, I went with my friends but I have to buy a ticket to get into the neighborhood and it would be better if I had a magic pass ready Waiting time is crazy 
5219,4, Premium Magic Pass is essential because there are many people Even if it is an open run the waiting time is Hell without a Magic Pass after 
5220,5,Fantastic place for fun and amusement park for families and friends
5221,4, what an amusement park If it rains 4 stars if it doesnt rain Ill go to Yongin 
5222,4,The place is enjoyable but I recommend migic pass if you are visiting on weekend or holidays Each ride has a wait time for more then an hr or 2 so it was a bit disappointing for the wait
5223,1, Came here on a weekday but the lines were crazy even the line to buy tickets We couldnt play any thing you have to wait for at least 2 hours for a ride 
5224,4, There are a lot of people but it was good There are many parades 
5225,5, Kids like it If you dont like to walk a lot and have to wait youll be in trouble 
5226,3, There were too many people and the air was too hot I waited in line and just came 
5227,3, Im sorry for the Magic Pass Be aware of it and go Do you have to make a reservation as soon as you enter 
5228,4,I think there should be more food stall so that the customers wont wait for too long  Foods are pricey too   Though it was fun and they have nice parade
5229,3,picked the wrong date as it was school holidays rides were packed just pick a date when its not the school holidays and it would be great the multiple parade schedules were great too
5230,1,Dont come during the summer to many people At least 2 h for every ride more for the better rides And the level of the rides is lower than in America or Europe
5231,5, Its always a good place but there are so many people and the quality of the restaurants food it was inconvenient that 
5232,1,Not enough AC and way too many people
5233,5, It was fun I guess the trend these days is renting school uniforms If you rent school uniforms and ride on rides I think you will have more memories 
5234,5, There were too many people but I had a new experience of Lotte World Ill have to prepare more strategically next time 
5235,4,I highly recommend the Magic Pass to save time standing in lines  The parade is a little creepy
5236,5, My legs hurt but I like it because there are so many fun things good good 
5237,3,The Ice Rink is good  Everything else has lines that are much too long to enjoy the park
5238,1, It was completely Halgate It would be better to avoid weekdays and vacation periods 
5239,4, Avoid during the holiday season There is no end to people 
5240,3, Even though we went on a Friday morning on a weekday it was very crowded Air conditioning is not cool either Magic Island is hot to death It really sucks in summer It really sucks during school holidays 
5241,5, Its so nice to have a place like this 20 minutes away by subway There are so many rides and its so pretty 
5242,5, Its fun but the line is too long to play properly It rained today but the rain stopped but they were surprised inside saying it was waiting due to rain So when I got inside the line was long and I had to 
5243,1, It was really bad No matter how many people there are Seolbing also says that shaved ice takes an hour I dont think Ill go there again Memories I had built up since I was a child flew away in one day 
5244,3, Whoa the crowd is huge Every time I go the wait gets longer 
5245,5,Good place syes
5246,5, I used the buffet restaurant and the meal is very satisfactory but the parking is the worst 
5247,5, I went on a weekday after my exams Im surprised that there are so many friends from the same school When I first got on Atlantis before Corona the line was supposed to be three and a half hours but it was three 
5248,5,So much fun Is it worth buying the VIP ticket
5249,2, Operating rides based on economic logic seems to be the worst 
5250,1, Its August 1st but its vacation season I feel like Ive been paying a lot of money and waiting I feel bad Even the parking fee Its a fucking lottery 
5251,5, Visited on July 30 2022 The lines are still guilds But it was easy to move around and it was nice to come inside and play when it was hot 
5252,1, Too many people on Mondays and terrifying personally this time was the worst 
5253,3,Stood in line for one ride for three hours the efficiency of operating wasnt not good The floor was sticky everywhere The food was disappointing But the rides were fun just not worth the wait and the money You can easily buy tickets at the door no need to struggle online
5254,5, it was fun I use the free pass 10 times I only picked the fun stuff 
5255,4, It was a weekday but there were too many people because it was a vacation 
5256,4,Best place for the kids
5257,5, Although it was Friday I still went on a weekday and experienced a new world  in many ways due to the crowds Still the parade I saw again after many years was grander and more fun than I remembered 
5258,2, Im crazy Entrance is too complicated 
5259,5,Long time no visiting since my kid was little child who now became a teenager and wanted to play with youngster friends here Youd better to use mobile app to use tickts
5260,5, peck Satisfied with shopping and satisfied with restaurants 
5261,5, The amusement park is large and clean and the staff are very friendly 
5262,5,Amazing place
5263,5,dot
5264,3, During vacation the basic 2 and a half hour wait for attractions 20 minutes for drinks Magic Pass closes as soon as admission starts in the morning 
5265,4, Its a weekday but its the vacation season so there are too many people so its basically an hour to ride the balloon once 
5266,3,Probably I should once again clarify that this is post pandemic which seems to have changed a lot how things work On top of that we should be fair and mention that despite being a work day it was already school break We arrived at 9 am 
5267,4,Its a weekday but its crowded
5268,5,Lotte world theme park Koreas first ever theme park that opened in 1989 I have been going here since it opened  They have giant indoor theme park which is nice for hot summers and cold winters plus outdoor area called magic island also
5269,1, Service quality is poor Compensation for customers who did not use the annual membership due to Corona is not guaranteed Lotte World doesnt give you a reregistration discount just because the annual 
5270,5, fun Atlantis Comet Express Bungy Drop I recommend French Revolution 
5271,5, I loved the place and the experience The food inside the place is a bit expensive Its good to check before you go if theres going to be a lot of people if its vacation or a holiday because there can be very 
5272,4, The childrens play facilities are very satisfactory but the Lotteria food inside was really disappointing 
5273,1,Do you love standing in a que for hours to ride decrepit rides whilst listening to the same song on repeat for hours If so lotte world is the place for you 
5274,3,Got here after 11 and the place already packed even on a weekday Long queues not worth the wait App to reserve rides completely useless as most times already out even I checked every 15 minutes
5275,5, Lots of people especially middle and high school students wearing school uniforms all over 
5276,4, There are many interesting attractions but for popular attractions such as French Revolution and Comet Express you have to wait an average of 120 minutes 
5277,2, It seems like the magic pass system needs to be reorganized but it is a manahan hopeful advisor 
5278,4,Beautiful gaming city
5279,1,Without the magic pass insane waiting time
5280,5, rides are fun There are more and more equipment that can be enjoyed in 4D You can experience various things such as parades and laser shows There are 
5281,4, Although it was a weekday there were a lot of people and there were many rides and it was fun 
5282,5, One of the chefs who continuously dumbles at Hawaii performances is really good at dancing full of excitement and has great fan service 
5283,5, We had a fantastic time one day is not enough there are long queues outside but its worth it dont be afraid 
5284,4, Ice rink is fun But there are too many people and the skates are too blurry 
5285,5, Its crazy with the huge crowd but Im moved and touched by everyones cheerful and happy smiles 
5286,4, During holidays and holidays there is a lot of queuewaiting for hours But its worth knowing 
5287,5, Super amusement park which is for its covered part the largest in the world Attractions for everyone children teenagers and adults 
5288,5, A very fun class The next coach is nice The price is okay 
5289,5, Lotte World is absolutely awesome There are magic passes lots of snacks and the rides are safe and fun The parade is super fun 
5290,5, It is good because there are many 3D and 4D rides that even those who cannot ride scary rides can ride If you do not want to stand in line we recommend purchasing a pass It is nice to be able to ride without 
5291,3,I still remember this place from my kid days There is no update or new attraction since then The pricing is pretty affordable if you reserve from Klook app Be sure to receive electronic voucher or if you run into issue entering
5292,3, In the city center a class of people a class of staff Even on weekdays if you go on the weekend you will be crushed to death 
5293,3, Because its vacation there are too many people and the air conditioner feels weak 
5294,5,Great for all ages Underground access from subway Indoor and outdoor rides Foreigners get a great discount
5295,5, Although there are many people compared to the area there are many photo spots and it was fun I wish there were more ATMs I didnt have cash so it was difficult to use 
5296,5, Comet Express Furum Ride Pharaohs Wrath The queue is too long 
5297,4,Nice great decor but long queues
5298,3,My evaluation is not as good as Everland
5299,5,Koreas Disney Land Best indoor rides I have ever seen long wait though
5300,4, I had a great time with the children It was indoors but it was hot I was sweating 
5301,4,Fun shows to watch and rides to ride So much shopping and plenty of food
5302,4,Really good variety of rides for the whole family remember to download the official app to have a smoother experience
5303,5, There are a lot of students in the evening difficult to take pictures 
5304,5,It was a good place and Lotte has a nice theme park to visit Very recommended
5305,5,Lotte World              1000  1900                  1000  1730   
5306,5,Lotte World may not be the best theme park due to its age and space limitations but a great cozy place for young kids for a day out
5307,5, There were a lot of people but it was the first time in a long time that I met the opening time and stayed until closing time before coming I wish the restaurant had a little more variety That part was a bit sad 
5308,5,We had so much fun and it was a dream come true to visit this awesome place If youre planning to visit Korea you should include this on your list of places to visit
5309,5, A place of dreams and hopes Lotte is good at everything except baseball 
5310,5, It was nice to be able to ride the rides a 6yearold child height 117 together At night it was even more fun to set off firecrackers indoors 
5311,5,lovely place to be
5312,2,2 stars  Without magic pass 3 stars  With magic pass 
5313,4,This is a 35 to 4 star experience This is actually one of the few indoor things you can do in Seoul all day during the brutal summer weather The place is massive theres a lot of things to do Many many rides and activities Theres a 
5314,4, Lotte World is getting better and better because of the yoke After that Lotte tries to do well Im cheering for you 
5315,5,Amazing vibes and atmosphere although as expected the queues for the more popular rides were insane Had to wait over 2 hours for some rides and even though we came when gates opened we waited for an hour to get on the first ride but the rides were all great Recommend the French Revolution and surprisingly the Comet Express
5316,4, Its fun and there are so many things to do but it was too hot to go in the summer Still if you want to spend the day to the fullest I recommend you go 
5317,4,Plan to spend the whole day here if you want to use most of the rides I came on a Monday at 4pm and was only able to get on 4 rides they close at 10pm Wish I spend extra for the Magic Pass Couldnt even venture out to Magic Island with 
5318,4, Price hyperinflation Too expensive Rides are fun Atlantis is a Magic Pass 
5319,4, If you go on a rainy day rather Juwa And I recommend not to ride the Comet Express The line is too long 
5320,4,I went to both everland and lotter world and I enjoyed both Im really sad I couldnt go to many outside rides as they were closed due to the rain but I did go on the comet express and although I did get soaked it was so so worth it 
5321,1, Few instruments Parking nuclear inconvenience A course to get lost at the parking lot exit On the other hand there are only a lot of places that sell them 
5322,5,Lots of fun for the whole family It has a lot of indoor attractions so even if its raining you can still go here If you dont like waiting in lines consider purchasing the magic pass which allows you to bypass the lines
5323,4,Prepurchased tickets for foreigners that included 5 magicpasses Took about 10 minutes to get in at opening 
5324,5, It was a good present to go on my eldest sons birthday wants to go again 
5325,5, I brought my baby with me there are so many things to see and the folk museum was really well made with the details 
5326,5, You have to wait a long time to get on popular rides but still John Jam 
5327,5, Amusement park that is very good for the price if you get a discount except for the drawback that there are too many people In a good location to visit there are many places to go after visiting such as nearby 
5328,1, A strange amusement park that discriminates against the disabled I prefer Everland because it is much more inclusive 
5329,4,  Lotte World is fun In general I recommend Cucumber Seafood 2nd floor and Magic Island Tteokbokki for restaurants It might be a bit spicy It is better to go when there are no people but on cloudy and rainy 
5330,5, Located at 240 Olympicro Songpagu Seoul a complex shopping mall with a building area of 581645 m2 and a site area of 128246 m2 In a broader sense it includes not only the complex but also Lotte World 
5331,4, Thank you to the bumper car staff for your kind explanation 
5332,5,Very nice place And you will have fun while you be there with your friends or family But the only disadvantage is that you need to wait 3060 minutes to play every game
5333,5, If you go through a discount from the telecommunication company the entrance fee is not expensive and the quality of shows and parades is better than before 
5334,5, Its a wonderful place The children are also very satisfied 
5335,3, In 2019 I visited this park on a Monday It was very very calm no covid I did 15 attractions and the organization of the queues was top Everything was open too The  today it was a disaster I dont know if 
5336,3, The most popular amusement park in Korea However the price is too high for you 
5337,4,YEAH HOW EXCITING 
5338,4,Kinda like miniturized Disneyland Too bad lots of attractions are still closed due to covid and rain But a must go for kids and kids at heart
5339,5, So good Except for a lot of people on weekdays 
5340,4,Went on a weekday 1030400 while local kids were in school Despite this there were lots of high schoolers around Seemed not very busy in the main halls but there were still significant lines at most rides 30 min The roller coaster 
5341,4, Lotte World 20 years ago Now Lotte World with children 20 years from now we hope that Lotte World will be enjoyed by our children 
5342,4,Lots of players wide place walking and dragging
5343,4,Love Lotte world  but always crowded and always most rides are under maintenance Also i wish they build more rides for adults 
5344,5, Good accessibility from the suburbs of Seoul Atlantis Gyrodrop Viking well worth the wait The magic parade is also good and the fact that you can play indoors in 
5345,5, Indoor and outdoor you can play regardless of the weather Because there are many sweet people popular rides must be prepared for a boring 
5346,4,Adorable indoor theme park great for kids and adults on a date It was pouring rain so we couldnt enjoy the outdoor rides but the indoor roller coasters were fun The entry fee is super duper reasonable too
5347,5, Its cute and cute and well done Of course its a place to go with friends but I usually go with friends Its fun to go with friends 
5348,4, Lotte World is so much fun There are a variety of rides and there are 3 magic passes per person so it was nice to be able to ride right away if you succeed every 30 minutes The parade was fun and its a pity I 
5349,5, There are a lot of people but I went on my birthday and got it 
5350,5,Good place to go shopping
5351,1, Unfortunately we didnt like our trip to Lotte World Many attractions were not open and the waiting times were excessively long For example we had to queue for 2 hours for an attraction this was not even for a 
5352,5,Its perfect for traveling with children
5353,5,Wonderful experience
5354,5, Its been a while since Ive come but I didnt expect anyone to punish me Ive been playing around 
5355,2, Its really nice but there are a lot of people and some staff are unfriendly 
5356,5,Its a small theme park but I enjoyed it There were a lot of kids and teenagers there Also theres an inside and outside area with rides
5357,5, The price is definitely going up Crowded even on weekdays  
5358,1,Stay away from this place We had an absolute awful experience staff is rude rides are mediocre at best This place summarizes Korea in general fake
5359,5, I almost lost my mind when I sat at the very end of the Viking 75 
5360,5, Its been a long time since Ive been there so its fun Magic Pass is a must I rode 11 balloons 
5361,5, Once you get in its hard to get out again We recommend that you buy a lens before entering 
5362,5, There are more and more people these days I feel good whenever I go Its fun to watch even with a lot of people 
5363,1, I bought the Magic Pass to get the benefit of skipping the line but even the Magic Pass is useless if it is lost in the rankings I have a magic pass but I cant use it 
5364,5, A place full of fun at an amusement park in the heart of the city 
5365,5, My 7 year old daughter loved it The size was just right and the rides were safe and fun There were a lot of people even on weekdays so I had to wait a long time for some equipment but next time I will buy a Magic 
5366,4, Because it was raining people gathered inside and the line was long French Revolution is a must 
5367,4, Gray Hall with Chung Hyunae at a job fair after a long time We all gathered together and went to the amusement park to play  
5368,5,Went there with my wife and boy we had so much fun I highly recommend going in early and have some magic passes ready you definitely would need them
5369,5,ice rink
5370,5, It is a dynamic place with various things to see and eat 
5371,5,Even though it was the weekend there were fewer visitors than I thought so it was perfect to play Of course the popular rides were too long to ride
5372,5,Somewhat long lines but thats the case with all amusement parks The rides were fun
5373,5,There are also various ice rinks for the four seasons
5374,4, I visited for the first time 30 years ago and visited countless times but it is still a mysterious place 
5375,5, Ive been to Lotte World tens of millions of times but this trip was the best gift in my life and if I get another chance next time I will go again 
5376,5, Very satisfied Gyrospin is scary Its hard to wait but Im completely satisfied 
5377,5,100100
5378,5,One of the best theme parks I have ever visited
5379,5,Full day fun Nice place to be
5380,5, I had so much fun It rained a lot in the middle but it stopped quickly and we had a lot of fun 
5381,4,Fun place for kids and teens height recommended 125cm above
5382,5, Needless to say The feeling of childhood is now with the kids 
5383,5,  
5384,5,One of the must visit places in Seoul should be definitely on top of the list while visiting this amazing countryit is worlds biggest indoor amusement park and lives up to the expectationsprofessional staffexcellent food options 
5385,5, Weekends are crowded If you go before 12 noon you can still reserve some Magic Passes 
5386,5,                    
5387,3, Crowded with students from field trips on weekdays The exits on the first floor are blocked everywhere so Im tired of looking for them 
5388,3,Too many teenagers and the wait time for each rides are like 40 minutes They give you these magic pass for quick entry but its near impossible to use them since they sell out in seconds
5389,3, I visited on a weekday but it was crowded as much as on weekends and although the free pass includes 3 magic passes it is a famous office that cannot be reserved 
5390,5, I went in a hurry to open at night but there were still a lot of people but it didnt take long for the children to ride so everyone had a good time 
5391,2, It was fun but the attitude of the staff was a bit annoying 
5392,3,Amusement park good for children
5393,5, A place that is always full of exciting dreams and hopes 
5394,5,must do this place was unlike any theme park ive ever been to i love the fact that its both in door and out doors as if the weather is bad you can just go in side just make sure not to vist on a holiday we accidentally went to 
5395,5, Lotte world is a good amusement park for several reasons  the decor is magical  There are attractions for all tastes 
5396,4, There werent as many people as expected but the popular rides had to wait about an hour and a half Otherwise you have to wait about 30 minutes to get it 
5397,4, It was very crowded even on a weekday Personally I recommend purchasing the Premium Magic Pass and enjoying it leisurely 
5398,4, A cool amusement park  but a very big minus point is that you have to wait around two hours  on average for the most exciting rides The ticket also includes three Magic Passes but you can only redeem them if 
5399,5, If you are going to buy a headband the one on the left is the biggest and has a lot of things when you enter the main entrance Another 5 times larger 
5400,1,Way too long waiting lines of up to 240 minutes
5401,5,Amazing
5402,5, I like it I like it I like it I like it I like it I like it 
5403,5,Super Cool 
5404,4, I went to Lotte Hotel Buffet I dont know if the menu is diverse The price is also going up 
5405,4, On weekdays I went in after 4 for after4 with my child so I rode it 7 times 9 times the number of times  World Monorail Flume Ride Jungle Exploration Boat No 2 Sinbad Adventure 
5406,5, Great for going out with children I like the parade the best If you win the skirmish you can ride the attraction twice 
5407,5, It is best to be able to ride the rides to your hearts content with cards and various discounts Food is the worst value for money 
5408,4, It hasnt changed since Ive been there for several years but its still a fun place 
5409,5,Had so much fun here A place to go with your partner or kids Plenty of familyfriendly rides with a handful of thrill rides Ambience and atmosphere was magical with plenty of locals renting high school uniforms to dress up and take 
5410,5, The children are so happy Of course adults will enjoy it too Its hard to wait in line because of the long line and everything else seems to be a good experience 
5411,3,Magic pass was a scam unable to reserve popular rides No point getting magic pass
5412,3, It was a day when the word nunjigam bombing fit perfectly I thought it would be okay because it was the day after Childrens Day 
5413,4, Everything was good except for the crowds and lots of garbage on the floor The rides were varied and fun and it was good to have delicious snacks and food 
5414,4, Magic Pass Premium on weekends Or the kiosk first 
5415,5, After all the amusement park is on a weekday but I have to wait for Atlantis for 2 hours 
5416,5, I was surprised because there were so many people and it was more than Disneyland It was much bigger and I was even more surprised 
5417,5,It is spectacular
5418,2, too many people Lotte World only tries to fill the staff with the Magic Pass and the average waiting time is 3 hours 
5419,5,want to find a decent ride want to find a kiddy ride well then you should go ride Jumping Fish Jumping Fish is literally slay queen No matter how long it is you have to ride it Its a one in a life time experience I dint care how old you are  but remember you have to be under 65yrs old to ride this Me and my friends had so much fun on this ride and were both almost 20 yrs old This was quite the experience So much better than waiting three hours for a short roller coaster 
5420,4,It was packed with people on the day I went there with my kids but we werent waiting in the lines for the roller coaster or anything so it was fine My kids liked it so much and its always a nice place to take many pictures I had many different cards with me but Master Card was most beneficial to get an onsite discount I didnt find this offer anywhere beforehand but was lucky that I had the card with me
5421,4,Fun place Hired cute uniforms We went on a Friday and it was packed full of teens Lined up for 3 hours for one ride Went up the Lotte Sky tower on the Monday and looked down into the park; it was empty Wish we knew that Otherwise it was fun
5422,5,Extensive development with a Lot of amenities and shopping Very well kept Clean and efficient Variety of stores and duty free shopping are available too
5423,5,It was a special treat for our daughters 7th birthday We have arranged for her to be a princess in the parade We spent two days in the park and enjoyed it My daughter felt very special and had the best birthday The park has lots to offer for different ages Its fun
5424,3,There are many kind of attractions suitable for adult The gyros the best So sad the muslim prayer room is closed due to covid and there are no other place to pray
5425,3,This was our first time in Seoul and the first place that we visited They dont have a lot of attractions to do and its a bit pricey Every month they close some of the attractions on certain days Im not sure why Go on a weekday less crowded and wear comfortable shoes Lotte World Adventure Park is not to miss We still had a fun time
5426,4,Nice in the seoul Its not that big though but its good to visit with kids Prices is not cheap Half day is fine to visit
5427,1,Shameful conditions for some of the aquatic animals There is a lack of space for their animals I I think places like this shouldnt exist that profit on animals in poor conditions
5428,5,I really like this place It has everything that I wanted in Lotte World Has a variety of restaurant a lot of amusement including ghost houses The night view is wonderful too
5429,4,I visited Lotte world on a rainy day  the outdoor park was closed but luckly it had indoor park was ineradicable huge park For indoor park you can have great park for adult and children different kind of activities were available  I had to choose to visit either Everland or Lotte World I chose to visit Lotte World as it was easier to access the park because I had late night flight on that day so if you have limited time  you want to go to a theme park go to Lotte World as you can go by metro
5430,5,The place is located in middle of jamsil area in Seoul there is a discount if you visit at night Lots of snacks too
5431,5,I live pretty close here so anytime I can I always go there I go there with my friends The attractions there is soo fun They also have good food too Even though I go there all the time its always fun
5432,4,Nice day out good fun indoors and out lots of places to rest eat and drink Suitable for all ages
5433,4,This is a good theme park for children to have fun when travel Seoul The theme park is at neat downtown that not far away travel need
5434,4,Whilst at the beginning I thought it was a little pricey the number of rides available to all and short wait time made it worthwhile Only downside was the lack of English speaking guides within the park which made it a little difficult to get around Other than that we had a great time
5435,4,we went there during our winter holiday and found out that during winter some of the outdoor rides was closed then we spend half day inside the lotte world but it was too packed most of the rides have around 40 minutes waiting line  but its worth the fun our 6 years old daughter was have some fun on the park  TIPS install the Lotte World Adventure apps on your mobile phone to get more info on the queue line and you also can book the ride as well
5436,4,Lotte World Tower is one of Koreas architectural crown jewels The tower symbolizes the meeting of the modern with the traditional nature and cutting edge technology and the accomplishments of man Lotte World Tower contains everything that is necessary for modern urban living
5437,4,We travelled in winter therefore chose Lotte over Everland and it didnt disappoint As any theme park there are many attraction rides etc Its connected to an outdoor amusement park called Magic Island and the theme park itself is connect to a shopping mall that features theaters sports facilities etc Its closer to the city and can be reached easily by public transport
5438,3,OMG if you are a 50 woman or a warm blooded man you are in for a hot night The temperature of this hotel is 28 degrees and you cannot get the air conditioning to work as it does not switch on in winter When we told the staff that we thought the air con was broken they checked it and it could not be lowered We were kindly given a fan It was not a silent fan but then again either am I
5439,4,Came on a week day but there were loads of people glad we took the tickets with the magic pass and saved a lot of time from queueing overall had a great time
5440,3,Avoid going during public holidays school holidays and weekends The queues are so long It takes 1 hour to queue for any ride The plus side is that its cheap entry tickets
5441,4,My 2 teens asked to visit an amusement park Wanted to visit Everland but was quite a distance Decided to visit some place nearer to our hotel Took a cab there and thought that the driver had sent us to the wrong place as we are not aware that the entrance is at the basement Unlike Disneyland Went in and there was a long queue to purchase the tickets There were many students Luckily the queue proceeded smoothly and fast Bought the tickets to the park and folk museum Did not go to the museum so we wasted on that Spent about 3 hours as there werent many rides that appealed to my teens We bought the so called fastpass in the park so my teens need not queue up The place was alright but not as good as Disneyland Need a bit of refurbishment though
5442,1,Visited with my three kids More crowded than Hong Kongs MTR Subway during peak hour Unreal They should have a concept of crowd control Too many people no exaggeration  A basic swing ride took a wait of 1 hour 40 mins quoted a 1 hour wait which was already unreasonable for the ride  3 minute ride  Will never visit ever again even if I was paid  If they employed a maximum occupancy limit it would have been a fun day for the kids Instead wasted one out of five of our days in Seoul  Will be disputing my credit card charge for this one to say the least Left after the one and only ride
5443,1,Average wait time per ride is 90120mins even on weekday  Completely overhyped and overpriced Unless you come in via Seoul Discovery Pass  You will be lucky to hop onto 3 rides for the entire journey  Go to Everland unless you like queuing up
5444,2,Its a big shopping centre with lots of entertainments like kids Theres really not much shopping Mostly games  food Its not a place for us
5445,4,The park is divided into outdoor and indoor Outdoor features some of the most thrilling rides and coupled with a few kiddy rides The castle is one of the prominent display outdoor that you will take picture with Recommended to buy fast passes as most rides have very long waiting time There are also plenty of Restaurants inside the park For very young toddlers they do have a designated indoor areas for them too
5446,3,Had fun but park was not as good like we imagine Kids section is fun for kids age from 2 to 7yrs old My child got bored after awhile Poor in general is old makes me thing of the theme park in Genting Highland
5447,2,So we decided to book a ticket to lotte world during our vacation to Seoul but I was really disappointed about the park Having been to Disneylands I would say lotte world is not even close to being as good as Disneyland I was hyped at first at the entrance wondering about the fun rides the park is going to offer but eventually i was greeted with disappointment when i took a look at the park map Basically the only fun ride was the Atlantis roller coaster and nothing else is that good Plus the place was packed with local students and I had to queue for 3 hours just for the Atlantis ride and trust me it wasnt pleasant at all By the time we completed the ride it was already evening I would say theyre trying to emulate disneyland with the castle and stuffs but boy was i wrong as it wasnt even a fun experience at all Rides were below average some places were not covered with the 1 day pass and of course the massive crowd I dont blame the crowd but rather how small the park is to accommodate the large crowd
5448,3,A much overhyped amusement park Id say with nothing spectacular really Generally great for thrillseeking teenagers perhaps adults and families with young kids Food is expectedly priced higher than usual Id say its good enough to have been there done that Doesnt entice us to return unless theres major revamp
5449,3,Visited on Tue 17 December 2019 Waited 15 hour for French Revolution VR They should remove VR when it is not VR Should have gotten the magic pass for this Luckily this roller coaster ride is quite fun with a 360 degree turn Only family rides have shorter queues around 5 to 1p minutes
5450,3,5th tallest building in the world On a cloudy day not worth going to the top of the floor Fortunately you are able to go to the 31st floor but have to queue for the access card where the food court is and the Signature 711 is located Nothing more nothing less
5451,1,Nice theme park but not at 50 USD Rides have long waiting times and staff are super difficult to deal with You are better off going to a local disneyland or other theme parks at that price
5452,4,I visit Lotte World on Sunday and the weather is light rain unfortunate for me Because the most extreme ride is closed The rest is just good
5453,5,kids enjoy the rides Come during weekdays less hassle and queue convenient facilities Prayer room is available but need to be request access via intercom ambiance were great many parades able to catch on value for money
5454,2,This amusement park is much more indoorcentric  and quite alot of the rides need extra payment which are not included in the entrance fee And the waiting time are really crazy even on a school day The outdoor park is quite small as well In short if you want to come here  I highly recommend you to get the Fast pass or else you would end up wasting alot of your time waiting
5455,4,Lotte world is just that its own little world that part amusement park part indoor ice skating rink underground aquarium part shop till you drop underground followed by restaurants galore from street food to fine dining Its your one day to explore underground activities all in one place In the spring its one of the best place to catch in Seoul to catch cherry blossoms around the lake Theres plenty to do for all ages that it will literally take you the whole day if you just take slow and steady
5456,1,Worst place ever even with a map its confusing to go around  Trying to be a Amusement park but its a giant arcade
5457,3,We went on a Thursday wait times for the 3 rides worth going on were 7080 minutes It is more aimed at younger children than teenagersadults Definitely not a must do especially if youve already been to a Disneyland before
5458,4,We visited Lotte World during our recent trip to Seoul Great for all ages I like both indoor and outdoor rides Negative points Queueing was 100 minutes for one ride We didnt ride any of the popular rides because the queues were 90 to 110mins per ride This is a whole world of entertainment Outside park inside entertainment food hall and shopping  mall
5459,4,Avoid weekend if possible We went on a Saturday There were just too many people The queue was too long We only managed to catch a few rides Suggest to pay extra to skip the queue
5460,5,That was a great visitgreat for everything great for all agesit has abit of everything for every ageneed to bring my whole familyso pretty good for the
5461,4,Our kids enjoyed mainly the indoor theme activities rather than the outdoor as the weather is too cold and windy Temperature was 1C Suggest bringing own food for the muslims as there are no halal food in there Kids enjoyed most of the activities The indoor is huge I suggest you guys starts from the top floor than down
5462,5,Skip the extra fee for the horror tomb Skip the extra fee for the horror Skip the extra fee for the horror tomb
5463,5,If using the train go to the Jamsil Station You can get to Lotte world without going outside there is a connection underground I have been to many amusement parks and I would not say that this has the best rides but I would say that it was a really fun environment and a fun place for kids and for friends just walking around and going on rides They do have some really awesome rides for adults but I dont think the adults will be doing the hair and dress up to be a princess for the day Especially when all the dresses are kids sizes They have parades and showtimes which are great Right now they still have the Halloween decorations up in the Halloween shows going on and I have to say they did an amazing job The lines for the rides are pretty long on the weekends especially after 4 pm Be aware that tickets have a discounted price after 4 which means a lot more people are there So there is a pretty big crowd for the Halloween show in Magic Island Make sure you hold your kids hands or you will lose them After 4 it is also common for lines on rides to run an hour to 150 minutes for wait time No exaggeration
5464,5,Went with some friends to Lotte World and had a blast at the park Made us feel like we were kids again 
5465,5,all the games is functions i prefer lotte world as the location is convenient to travel by subway and the waiting queu is not too long but depends on days you visit it
5466,1,I dont want to come here again for life Everything was suck and I cant understand their rule of riding some Dont wanna recommend here to anybody
5467,4,This is my second time going here I like both indoor and outdoor rides However I prefer outdoor since its more daring for older people Depends on when you come the park would decorate itself into HalloweenChristmas theme I went during Halloween and it was great to see display of Halloween; and I saw zombies come out in the evening to frighten people It was scary and funny Also you can rent some cute clotheshigh schooluniforms to walk around and take pictures Overall if youre a foreignermake sure to google ticket discount and go see Lotte World There are also restaurants indoor where you can buy food Its waiting for you
5468,3,can I just wonder around the park for free if I am not willing to play or I have to pay anyway a fee to enter the Lotte World
5469,1,What a disappointment this place was  We arrived at around 6pm for some evening fun paying around 30pp to get in There was no indication at the ticket desk that most of the major rides were either closed or reservation only  whatever that means  So upon entering the park we try to get on some of the big rides  French Revolution Closed for Inspections  Drop tower Closed for Inspections  Gyro drop Just closed  Comet coaster Reservations only and rude staff  Atlantis coaster Huge queue but at the back of it Closed and rude staff  Some of the other smaller rides inside were pleasant enough and the park is themed beautifully just a shame that they decided to charge full price when all their major rides were innaccessible  Also anytime we tried to spend money including buying the tickets with our GBP credit cards in the park we were forced to use their scammy currency conversion and end up paying a huge fee All the staff said paying in KRW doesnt work  what a load of rubbish  In short avoid this place at all costs and enjoy somewhere else in Seoul for the day or evening
5470,4,We got our tickets online with a magic pass 5 options Basically you can choose 5 rides and cut the queues without having to book the timing like the magic pass on the main website The entrance tickets are also discounted on the third party website Apparently it is a promotion only for foreigners So you have to bring your passport  The park itself was great fun There were lots of rides for all thrill levels both indoors and outdoors Atlantis Gyro Drop and French Revolution were some of the more thrilling rides I remember riding Definitely worth using the pass for If you visiting with young kids I did see there were some rides that were only for young kids The park really caters to all ages  For the Instagram mets there was also an area inside near the VR attractions for taking selfies The selfie studio is set up with sets and props as well as tripods for rent We loved taking pictures with the various backdrops  We happened to be there for Halloween so there was also costume rentals and face painting extra costs near the entrance There was even a haunted house set up Not to forget the Halloween parade We saw that they even has some of the park guests who were dressed as princesses participate  Lots of food affordable food available as well Food stalls as well as set restaurants and food courts were available all over the park There seems to have been no issues about bringing your own too We brought in our own water  When it was time to go we exited into the Mall and we glad to find that there was a Lotte Mart around the corner of the exit So manage to squeeze in a little grocery shopping before having to head back  Overall I felt it was a fun place to visit for the whole family
5471,5,We bought tickets onlineWe got there by subway to the South entranceThere is a giant indoor park and an outdoor parkThere is a wide variety of ridesHowever there are long queues for some of themThere is a folk museum inside the indoor park with stunning dioramas with thousands of models
5472,5,We took friends here who are visiting Korea for the first time It was also our first time We missed getting the magic passes that come with your regular park admission so will remember that for next time We were also here for the big halloween party so crowds got heavier than I anticipated in the afternoon but we had a really nice time My friend had trouble using her card won is easiest Lots of options for food and reasonable lines
5473,5,My 6yearold daughter and I visited Lotte World twice during our recent trip to Seoul I must say at first i was worried the language barrier might spoil the fun but it turned out to be no problem at all Every ride has clear bilingual instructions on height and safety rules plus all the staff can communicate in basic english  There are plenty of rides to suite all ages but the outdoor rides in Magic Island are mostly for older kids over 130 or 140cm tall  I would suggest you purchase the Magic Pass for Express entrance if you wanna avoid long queues especially on weekends and holidays  Yeah so definitely recommend Lotte World if you like theme parks My child says its more fun than Universal Studios and Legoland
5474,4,This is a fun indoor park to visit while youre in Korea There are plenty of activities for the young and old alike
5475,3,Its been around forever and if youre a foreigner on sight seeing no need to go inside unless you are up to ride some in the theme park Mostly very crowded with kids and teenagers and family units There arent much alternatives around the city anyways
5476,4,We decided to go to this park on a whim Lotte world is the biggest indoor theme park in the world It is at the edge of the lotte department store at Jamsil station If you buy an online ticket you need to walk all the way around the park to the southern gate and then enter that side It doesnt matter where you leave your bags as the lockers are accessible from several exits of the park  The park extends outdoors and there are some events centred around halloween Specifically the indoor haunted house is not very scary but the outdoor house with entry fee of 5000 won is very scary 55 spooks Rules involved Dont let go of the rope no running dont blind the actors The wait times in the park are so mixed and with a ticket you only get to reserve 3 rides I didnt really like this system as some rides are reservation only and can run out very fast I recommend you book asap for a ride that looks interesting as we missed out on both of the massive indoor roller coasters operating that day Furthermore the outdoor 3 biggest coasters were all closed for maintenance A wait time under 30 minutes is tolerable and not worth wasting a magic pass on The staff were also mind enough to let my friend and I into the same ride even though she was in the reserved session after mine  My other big complaint is that staff are very unprofessional and let their friends into rides ahead of the queue There was a halloween show that started 6pm and two friends went in to chat with their mate despite the sign saying it is dangerous for individuals It also seems impossible to access the ice skating rink without leaving the park Some staff tell you to leave if youre a foreigner to use the outside escalstor and you wont be let back into the park
5477,3,The main attractions were closed however there was no notice when we purchased tickets Waiting time is up to 90 min so suggest to buy a magic pass Good for children up to 14 maybe Mine were 1416 so not really interested
5478,5,We went on 11919 chuseok 1214919 Theres usually a 50 discount for foreigners Coupon usually avail on their website only few days before the holiday initially we wanted to go on another day after 4pm with the halfday ticket but since theres a 50 we went full day We r glad that we made the right choice We went in around 9 Theres little or no queue at all in the morning We therefore do all the popular rides first We were even able to do twice on some of the rides Hours later the queue starts to build up but still we were able to queue within 1530mins for most rides We were there till 4pm and managed to complete all the rides that are suitable for our kids aged 58 When we exit around 4pm we saw a long queue outside at the ticketing counter and was so glad that we didnt go for the after 4pm option
5479,5,This was the best place to play indoor games There are also variety outdoor games The price was affordable
5480,3,The Pasha restaurant already CLOSE Thus the only option that I notice is sulbing bingsu shop or bring some snacks from the lotte mart outside We left early and not manage to finish exploring the entire park since we are so hungry Most of the staff excluding the information counter personnel cannot speak and understand English which is very sad
5481,1,Too many people Each ride need to queue up for at least 2 hours Never go again The theme park is very old
5482,4,Spent my birthday at Lotte World Adventure and I must say that this place exceeded my expectations I was concerned that it would be more suitable for young children and whilst there are really a lot of rides and attractions catered towards a children and a younger audience there were plenty of things for adults to entertain themselves with with as well  Unfortunately we went on a super wet and rainy day and could not try all the rides on the Magic Island what they call the outdoor area because they all closed once it started pouring Thankfully there is a relatively large and pleasant indoor area but we had to queue for ages for the indoor rides  My advice before going to Lotte World is to plan your visit well Decide which rides or attractions you want to visit and consider if its worth investing in the Magic Passes We spent most of our day queueing and it can get quite frustrating to stand in lines for 5060 minutes at a time The Magic Passes would save time for sure but if Im not mistaken you still need to fight for certain ride slots Do check that you arent going on a public or school holiday in S Korea and do avoid weekends We went on a random Thursday  to our knowledge there were no holidays but still the place was packed with school children and teenagers  Another tip  dont miss the Folk Museum It was actually a really impressive museum and we enjoyed exploring the exhibits
5483,5,I didnt do much research before coming here and expect a rather simple theme park I am wrong It has all a theme park to offer and more From outdoor rides to indoor activities It was a rainy day but we still able to catch some outdoor rides like the gyro drop spin and comet express The indoor part is also huge with so many rides and activities Lots of food outlets Never out of choices A day is not enough One tip is never buy ticket on site Better to purchase through online site such as klook or Trazy as you can get almost half price Also dont forget to visit the museum Worth a visit
5484,4,Very nice well designed place with lots of rides Its both indoor and outdoor It is very similar to Disney
5485,4,As i went with a tour guide we only had a few hours there and shortage of time and it was really crowded so we did not ice skate or play with any of the rides We just walked around take photosQuite boring if youre already there but unable to playThey have a mall for you to shop too but again due to time constraint we were unable to walk around and shop So if you plan to come here please ensure youre not in a tour group and do not go during peak season as time will be wasted in queuing up for the rides as it will get really crowded
5486,4,Lotte world is a nice amusement park right in the city There is a indoor section and an outdoor section so even on rainy days and in winter you can still go and have a good time There are plenty of places to eat and drink in the park The inside part has balloon shape cars that go around the ceiling and a wild indoor rollercoaster There is a stage that has performances several times a day Between the park and the metro station there is a big shopping mall So you could go the park go shopping eat and never have to go outside Great for those cold rainy days
5487,4,It was a rainy day in Seoul and I still wanted my daughter to experience Seoul I remembered Lotte World was indoor and it would be something she would enjoy She made little comments here and there about it not being Disney but once she walked inside she loved everything she saw Lines were pretty long but thats to be expected Fun little rides for the kids and little entertainment segments and even a photography section where you can take pics on your own camera making it a photo shoot
5488,5,Lotte World is an indooroutdoor amusement park in Seoul which is easily accessible by public transportation There are attractions for everyone in the family from the fun to the thrilling and you can easily spend much time here Take advantage of the fast pass feature for the attractions that are popular and make the most of your visit
5489,5,There are 2 different kinds of magic passes One is 5 rides and the other is day pass What I learned today was that magic day pass is unlimited and no need to book You just show up and enjoy a ride Important point is that this day pass is only available for the first 100 customers who come to the magic pass stand inside of the lotte world So once you get in with your general access card go to the magic pass stand right away to get yours  We were there until 6pm with plenty of resting and eating But did at least 13 rides Highly recommended Good luck and hope you enjoy your visit
5490,1,The park is too busy  it waste of money to go there and pay USD50 for an adult where you are do nothing else waiting in a queue for your kids also you are not allowed to go outside the park and come back using the same ticket  I prefer going to EVERLAND instead
5491,3,I was overwhelmed by the sea of people I thought my toddler would be carried away with the tide so I had to hold her the entire time The toddler rides were fun and the 3 d Dr agon game was fun
5492,3,I booked a tour package for the day that included Nami Island and Lotte World It was a good place to be in if you had young kids My son didnt enjoy this place at all and he was in a hurry to leave I had to see everything since we paid for the entrance already We didnt do the rides we just watched the shows and walked around  What I like about the place is there was an indoor part of the park It was a warm day and we walked around the outdoor park and left  The bonus I guess was the mall where we got to buy Lotte products in the grocery store  If you have kids of young ages they would enjoy this very much
5493,4,Went on a rainy day so was a bit disappointing cause the whole first floor was closed all the rides and the good stuff its anyway nice insidecome as early as you can very long lines are waiting for you xD  couples
5494,1,3 of the rides are closed there is no show snacks water and ice cream are sold out Average wait time for one of the available 3 rides is 15 hours plus Dont come
5495,5,There is an indoor and outdoor amusement park with lots of rides including trill rides The VR rides are really good Plan to spend the whole day there as half a day is not enough
5496,4,Only had limited time here but was very good decided to miss all the long lines but there was still plenty to do
5497,5,It is amazing thereMy daughter was pleasedWe played lots of things like VR and take many pictures there My daughter bought a piggy plushie there Overall it was amazing
5498,4,This is one of the most famous amusement parks in Seoul A trip to Seoul would never be complete without visiting this place It is located at the city center  connecting to a mall and half of the rides are inside enclosed facility It looks a bit crowded and I personally still prefer recreational parks in the open If you are afraid of the sun then this is ideal for you LOL Could have been better if the instructions were in English and the personnel knows how to speak as well
5499,4,Not like other countries theme park this place is located in the middle of Seoul It can be reach by subway easily It is connect with shopping malls and hotel In Lotte World food is not reconmendable  actually it is expensive taste not so greatI recommend you have meal in Lotte malls food court before you get into Lotte World If you have more than 4th grade they can hanging around and get ride without youSince place is not that big you can have relax moments It is safe and clean Eventhough it is little old but well maintained
5500,4,We had wanted to get there by 930 for opening time but didnt quite make it until 11 am My advice arrive to the mall for 9  eat breakfast at the mall We used Govoyagin to buy tickets on the spot for discounted tickets The earlier you get there the shorter the lines Our girls spent most of the day in lines Our 7 yr old son was able to go on rides for his age quite frequently There is plenty of space to sit and rides for all ages Overall a good way to spend the day
5501,4,Dont expect disneyland or universal studio class ride Still fun for family with young children and also entrance ticket is very cheap
5502,4,This has an INDOOR  OUTDOOR PARK connected with each other Though not very big but it is entertaining and we found it better than Everland 30 minutes drive within SEOUL An entertaining day where kids can enjoy Offers an ice skating stadium too
5503,3,Good to spend a day in the theme park but nothing more even if you cannot cover everything We bought the 1 day pass with 5 times express credits Managed to use most on more popular rides and most are located in the outdoor section  Disappointed that a few exciting rides are undergoing maintenance work To be honest been to much much better theme park with fantastic rides  Remember there is no reentry unlike many other theme Parks Like those in Singapore Australia and Japan etc  A good experience but not a must come
5504,5,Affordable amusement park in the minddle of Seoul For foreigner please take ticket from Klookcheapest  I went during summer and weekdays no hard queueenjoy park
5505,1,We went on a Friday after Memorial day holiday in Seoul May have been the most stupid time to go other than memorial day itself  I paid for 3 tickets on Kloop ticket collection was far away from the main entrance A good 1015min walk after asking 3 different people and added 5 magic passes to two of those tickets for an extra S100 What a waste of money The magic pass system is terrible Every 15 minutes the system opens to allow time slots to be booked to reserve the ride and skip the queue It has very limited number of time slots each hour and try as we might for 2 hours we could not reserve anything Each time the reservation started It showed all slots filledclosed about 10 seconds after it opened Eventually all time slots had been reserved and we had to queue with everyone else So that was 100 down the drain We didnt ride any of the popular rides because the queues were 90 to 110mins per ride We were there for 10 hours until closing time and rode 5 rides all day We thought Screw it lets pay extra to play the VR games But no Theres a height restriction and my girl was 5cm below it  Also the stupid parade that they run through the main indoor Adventure land around 2pm will section off large areas which cannot be crossed easily or at all during some parts of the parade So dont get separated or you wont be able to return until after the parade ends And all this online advice about going for the popular rides during the parade I found to be bull crap The queues were long and getting longer still  While my 10yr old enjoyed it as an adult  I wouldnt wish the experience on my worst enemy Only a parents love for his kids got me through this day  Just be prepared to queue Bring your tunes and your headphones battery pack for your phones a portable fan sweaty queues whether indoor or out snacks drinks and pack light There are plenty of lockers but they are single use so if you do use them then make sure you keep the important stuff with you One thing I wish I had was a collapsible stool You will stand for a long long time at Lotte World in queue after queue I saw some parent bring a picnic mat for the kids to sit and lie on She was a local with local knowledge  Food and beverage prices are not super expensive but nor are they cheap Expect to pay amusement park prices  I wish I could say something nice about Lotte World but I cant I just taste bitterness
5506,4,Lotte World has its own charm Its indoor attractions are worthtrying At the Magic Island we tried the Gyro Drop and it was fine  Horror of Horrors  The Horror House had a long line of people and we waited for almost an hour We were given 3D glasses as we entered The design of the viewing room was okay but when the show began I realized that it truly wasnt worth the wait  The poor content of the 3D show was disappointing I slept throughout the rest of the viewing time The effects were way below my expectations and the absence of a good story frustrated me no end  If only I could tell the people outside that they have to look for another attraction I could have done it so  Well the administrators of this theme park have to give this a quick response
5507,5,Went during spring break with a group of first graders The kids loved it and me too The park is huge and and I think it has enough attractions for little ones The parade at 200 pm was amazing the kids enjoyed it while eating ice cream I loved the fact that the park has an indoor area and the outdoor which is great when there is not good weather or air quality Overall if you are in Seoul and have the opportunity visit Lotte World
5508,5,117 floors in 1 minute Super modern Located in Gangnam district Quite expensive entrance if you want to get to the top compare to the prices in Seoul
5509,4,Happy to see lots of young kids and high schoolers Long wait will prevent you from enjoying many rides though
5510,5,You can bring your family and kids will like the rides  they have indoor rides for kids below 10yrs old and the outdoor rides for adult atleast 12 yrs old above
5511,5,Still halfway through the day but this adventure land is paradise for the children Recommended for families Awesome 3D VR experiences Bigger indoor than expected Still yet to find the outdoor segment Floors aplenty of amusement games food stalls and activities
5512,5,Its a beautiful shopping  mall and very big too but little far from the center of Seoul many good restaurants and shop  Good for family with children too  Best way to get here by taxi 
5513,4,Came here on a weekday evening on an after 4pm discounted ticket with our 3 yo No real crowds maybe some most popular adult rides had 15 minute lines but we breezed through it without spending more than 5 minutes in a line Looks like most of the visitors are local young adults so kidfocused areas didnt look busy  Lots of fun to have for all ages Only few rides were available for toddlers but it was quite enough for us Also keeping in mind just the fun value of exploring all the territory plus a little musical play they perform it all comes down to at the very least 2 hours of activities enough to exhaust your kid  One big minus and 1 for the number of activities which require extra cost Didnt use any of them out of principle so dont know if they are worth it or not But entry fee is high enough Id rather pay extra 5 and not be annoyed when stumbling into some random place only to be met with sorry this costs extra All of them looked completely empty as well
5514,3,We accidentally went the day after Childrens Day so there were lots of school groups It was quite tricky to find our way to the right queues as we didnt know the name of the rides or which floor they started on Several rides had wait times of over 2 hours which we were not prepared to wait for
5515,5,Here are my tips for you to get the best out of your Lotte World visit so you can spend less time on queuing 1 Go on a weekday 2 Buy your ticket on trazycom theres a special promo exclusive for foreigners which gives you an option to purchase the admission ticket at 16 off  3 Magic Pass rides  free sausage  1 free VR attraction for just an extra 20 It is definitely worth it There is also an option for 5 Magic Pass rides 3 Download the Lotte World app so you can check queue times and decide which ride to best use your magic pass on Theres an option to reserve on the app but those are usually gone in minutes so its best to visit the magic pass kiosk in the 1st flr and B1 location is in the map Pls note that you have to use your 1st magic pass first before you can make another kiosk reservation 4 On top of the 3 magic passes you can use your ticket as a magic pass 3 more times So you actually get 6 magic passes total Just go straight to the ride itself no reservations needed
5516,1,I am so regretting what I wrote about this hotel just before Its bad for club guest If you have plan to meet with your guest or friend at the clubhouse you MUST expect to pay for your guest or friend Per person 25 even they drink coffee So dont be upset if they charged your guest
5517,5,Went with my 7 year old daughter For several of the rides we went on we did have to wait for about 20 mins There were some long lines for the roller coaster and the boat ride but I was not about to wait over 90 minutes to get on these Plenty of food options A great day out with plenty of things that would interest all ages Oh and if you pay for the tickets by Mastercard you get 20 discount on the admission price That was a nice surprise which I did not know about
5518,2,Too crowded Had to queue 3 hours for one single outdoor ride Way too many people and it was not enjoyable at all Not recommended Perhaps the indoor rides would take a shorter time but overall not enjoyable at all
5519,5,It was our fourth family hols and this year we choose spring Since we have been to everland in 2012so we went to Lotte World by subway and it was locates near to lotte sky tooDuring spring there was beautiful blooming flower and many visitors enjoyed taking their pictures like usWe can choose either to buy tickets before 4after 4 pmThere are long queue for a rides and since we was with our 7 yrs old daughter we just having rides with less queing and taking pictures at the castlesAnyone who wanna be here it takes a day to spend family time here and enjoy with kids too
5520,1,Im writing this while still in the queue for our second ride We have been here for 4 and a half hours now I was afraid it could be crowded so we went on a Monday and I bought a 5x Magicpass which i could not use a single time because all seats have been booked out almost immediately for all attractions which are popular I think its only worth a visit if you are totally into waiting or if you come with children because the attractions for small children seem to have less waiting times
5521,4,Beautiful amusement park We chose to go here because theres both an indoor and outdoor park My 8 year old daughter really enjoyed the parade It was really nice We had a really good time with our family and friends
5522,1,Here is our experience 3 adults and 2 kids We were picked up at 830 from the hotel and taken to Lotte World The trip took some 60 min and after getting organized with tickets etc it was already 10 We were told to return to the meeting point at 1120 We all got full day tickets including any rides After getting familiarized we realized that there were so all Magic tour tickets available allowing to skip the line Further more also attendants tickets for adults just following the kids around and not doing rides Cheaper of course Our 4 year old managed 3 rides and our 12 year old managed only 1 and had to give up the 2nd ride due to too long queue  At 1123 we were noticed that time was up and time to return either direct to hotel or to a shopping center We opted for the shopping center which turned out to be a small souvenir shop Later on I reviewed what we had booked and paid for USD 294  It was a whole day Lotte World Package Deal If by any chance Viator or the tour operator read this our Booking reference was BR697267984 We were clearly cheated We had enough other things to do in Seoul so did not do anything about this then But now thinking back I like to warn others for this   
5523,3,The place is huge and the best thing about it is that most rides are indoors We didnt even realize that it had been raining for most of the day till we rode the train at Jamsil station the station is connected to the mall and got off Myeongdong station  I yawned through most of the rides and the queues were extremely long as we were there on a weekend The kids ages 9 and 10 enjoyed themselves though They got to enjoy VR rides that gave them the impression they were riding actual roller coasters Other underground rides they found too scary so we spent most of our time at Wild Tours located on 1F
5524,5,grabbed margaritas from Vatos urban tacos mallside bar in the underground Lotte world Shopping malls We were margaritad quickly and firmly Regardless we managed to buy the tickets online at the gate a huge saving Sidestep to the one hour of ice skating where my friend ice skated well his first time  I was speed skating in rental skates OMG so much margarita courage hahaha having an amazing time Actually we lost any idea of time but it was running out Made our way to the foreign guest entrance for Lotte world which was challenging yet we made it in We lost things along the way some shopping a power bankhahaha when we finally found the indoor French revolution rollercoaster there was a 70min estimated wait  then an angle appeared out of nowhere and vipd us to the front of a queue with a magic pass It was actual magic Thank goodness  Then an awesome 4D movie adventure Flyventure excellent We did see a lights parade  indoor fireworks during our chaotic cascade through this indoor entertainment shrine All in all we missjudge available time  missed alot but still have and amazing fun tale to tell Really it was very cool very wow  Arriving as late as we did the full price would not have been great value So if your short on time or late or experiencing high times this deal makes it really worthwhile
5525,3,Check in was easy and friendly Obviously the location is excellent if you like to shop or go to Lotte world theme park Theres a subway station right in front Not a lot to do nearby once the mall closes at 10 My friend enjoyed the sauna while my teens enjoyed the theme park The beds were comfortable but the rooms had no drawer space Hotels bakery did have much but theres plenty to eat a decent breakfast at the underground shopping go downstairs thru the Lotte department store doorway Theres lotteria angel in us coffee shopbreakfast sandwich krispy cremedoughnuts samsong bakeryfamous breadpastriesodeng place that opens before the mall opens Then theres the food court at the mall Take the end elevator to get a great view of the outdoor theme park I would definitely stay again if the price is right
5526,5,If you wanna spend one evening with your friends in way cool I recommend you Lotte World It is cheap and you need a whole day
5527,3,The rides were honestly more suitable for teens or younger kids though its still a great place The queue for the rides were really long and it took us almost 2 hours jusy to ride a ride in the cold Would be fun to go but not a must go if youre there
5528,2,Perhaps this is a bit harsh and may not be the case if you have younger children but if I could have a doover I would have skipped Lotte World We went with two teenagers and we found the rides to be meh and the long lines not worth the ride I can see how the park is popular with locals but if you have limited time on your trip to Seoul Lotte World is not worth the time or money I would recommend skipping it
5529,4,I have been here a few times and a great place when its cold or raining Great for teens 110cm and 120cm seem to be the ideal heights to ride rides Otherwise children smaller than this will have limited access to rides
5530,5,This popular amusement park which is both indoors and outdoors is easily accessible by all public transportation Its filled with amusements for all including roller coasters flat rides motion simulators and much more Weather is not an issue since many of the attractions are indoors Take advantage of the Magic Passport feature similar to the old FastPass of WDW to skip lines of certain rides
5531,4,This is a whole world of entertainment Outside park inside entertainment food hall and shopping shopping shopping It was amazing to watch the people having fun and enjoying all the possibilities to be entertained For us it was a little bit to loud We are not used to that common notices However what a fine location to enjoy life
5532,5,Shopping  supermarkets  market stores  restaurants  up market stores clothing handbags jewellery Shoes Perfumes Sports  plus latke Lotte stores both dudes of main road  Multiple children areas including ice rink and other childrens games areas
5533,2,Costs about 57000W 50 each and that doesnt get you into all the rides The prices drop after 4pm The wee ones about were having a great time I advise you to get there early  The queues are absolutely horrendous upwards of 60 minutes for everything from the monorail to the balloons The Haunted House and Hall of Mirrors are not included and cost extra because theres profit to be had thats why  Its a very strange place that looks like a deranged billionaire took elaborate steps to exactly copy Disney World but had a lawyer tweak it all juust enough to not be sued  Expect Rickey Louse Roland Cluck and their slowwitted accomplice Doofy with his dog Plato to ride on parade singing about how amazing the LOTTE Corporation a division of GloboDynamix Defence Systems is overpriced nibbles permeating the air with 20 calories of sugar per breath lines stretching into the next millennium and people everywhere no space unfilled by person not an iota of room not occupied by human literally 100 of all available capacity used by corpus humanis In other words stuffed to the gunnels with homo sapiens  Kids will like it though 
5534,5,Various interesting experiences  happy memories you can have with all members of your family particularly with young children It can be a mini Disney park in the middle of a city of Seoul You can govisit there via Metro system from where you stay wherever youre
5535,5,This theme park is marvelous for family I bring my kids there and they enjoy very much The indoor part is full of younger childrens fun games The outdoor park is good for bigger children The whole family enjoy lot of fun there
5536,4,My husband and I went to Lotte World for a day date We had so much fun The lines can get very long like all amusement parks; however the rides were fun and well kept
5537,5,I had a lot of fun times in Lotte World This place is my dream since I was a child The moment I step my foot into this place I was so amazed by how big this indoor themewark were There are shows that you can watch and it was so entertaining
5538,4,If one read most if not all of the reviews you will find a few common themes crowded long queue long waiting hours we experienced more or less the same Looking at it at another perspective I find this location a very popular spot for locals especially students and kindergartens No doubt the basic amenities such as toilets are well maintained so they are clean and functional Plenty of food stalls and restaurants spread out so one never runs out of options  There are plenty of articles floating round on the tips so parents do read them otherwise invest in Magic Pass Premium download the Lotte World Adventure Magicpass app to enjoy a few rides with dedicated time slots Of course avoid peak season if you can  Our children 7 and 1 were enjoying themselves nevertheless but the waiting time really did eat up most hours not forgetting time for lunchdinner and breaks The number of ridesattractions are sufficient to keep the kids occupied enough that they can never finish all the rides  The indoor theme park can be like a maze so parents need to read the map carefully while trying to match the ride timing so that one would not miss the parade So its not just an adventure for the kidsteens but also quite another one for the parents
5539,4,It is a huge indoor park with a small outdoor section as well Reach early as it is not possible to cover the whole park in 2 day Its was Christmas week so Christmas evening parade was worth seeing Many VR rides are very good so are the outdoor ones like roller coaster gyro etcA must visit place
5540,1,Came here with my sister on a Wednesday and it was packed with students No personal space during the line up will most likely get bumped Waiting time were minimum 2 hours  What foreigners need to know is that they have a lotte world adventure apps where u can reserve 3 rides per person We only knew about it at 11am and most of the rides were fully booked for all the slots Managed to book the pharaoh which was somewhat a fun ride Its called the magic pass reservation Be sure to reserve magic pass for the more trilling rides after getting your tickets We waited for the French Revolution for a whooping 35hours The ride lasted less than a minute and VR was working Not the best experience Never going again You will see the longest queue in your life Went there at 930am left at 8pm Managed to get on 5 rides only Not worth my time and money tbh Shouldve went to Everland People in their 20s should just go to Everland for more thrilling rides This place can be skipped for sure
5541,2,We went there on a Monday in the morning But the amount of people queuing was unbelievable The waiting time was at least one hour up to 3hours The most popular rides have longer waiting time ofc During 6 hours spend there we took 3 rides total  You can buy a magic pass but that costs extra 100k and you cant use it on all rides And lets be honest 50 for the regular ticket is not so cheap  Also you have to pay extra for some of the ridesattractions  To sum up I dont recommend it neither will I go there again
5542,4,Room was clean hotel staff were very polite Hotel was conected to a department store Very convenient for shopping
5543,2,Huge crazy place A lot of people huge queue In fact you will not have opportunity visiting more then only few action cause the time in queue takes about 130 hours
5544,5,Its was wonderful experience i was in Signiel hotel next to Lotte World First it was easy to reach the place  Second its really huge place and amazing Third next year for sure i will visit Seoul with my family
5545,5,Theres so much things to enjoy here good for adults and kids Everyone will enjoy even on winter since most of this is indoor  The parade is amazing You should see this when you visit
5546,4,For the winter season it is good to visit Lotte World because they have both an indoor and an outdoor theme park If it gets too cold for the kids outdoors then just bring them to the 4storey indoor park
5547,5,We were there during the winter It was packed with people Cant get into any rides as the waiting line was unending  gotta wait for at least 45mins per ride Tonnes of kiosks and shops selling snacks food and souvenirs Theres an indoor  outdoor park with lotsa rides We got to watch their Christmas Parade too Awesome If you want to go to Lotte World I would suggest that you go during off peak season Then youll benefit from the rides
5548,5,my first visit to the lotte world was great It has a shopping place outside the lotte world once in the lotte world there is 2 section where indoor section is more for kids of primary school level and the outdoor section is more thrill with rides Need to gear up if going on cold weather
5549,4,Never miss to visit this Amusement park if you are in Seoul with your kids There are lot of rides shows and a whole lot of eating options And not to be missed is Carnival parade which boosts of more than 200 performers singing and dancing as they take a round around the park The park also stages various themed musicals at their central stage where one can sit and enjoy them Beware most your time may be spent waiting to take the rides nd be ready to shell out more for your food than it is worth This park is huge plan full day here
5550,4,This shopping mall was directly across from my hotel  and even though I hate shopping I had to have a peek  A massive shopping centre with about everything you could want to but all under one roof  Also some very nice restaurants and food stalls with some very nice snacks  Electronics food and clothes for every occasion I must visit for those who like to shop 
5551,4,Here Lotte World is one of the biggest theme park in Korea Although it is smaller than Everland it has more thril rides here Personally recommand French Revolution Gyro Swing and Atlantis for adults Most of the other rides are for childrenfamily And be prepared for very long lines and harsh prices of foods
5552,2,Ok we were here on a Saturday night which is probably not ideal as it is very busy  The rides are mainly for little kids so nothing too exciting for adults We wanted to go on the hot air balloon ride but the queue was 2 hrs We queued for about 12hr for the monorail ride but because its winter half of the ride route was cancelled so it was a very short one  Some nice photo ops outside at the Disney looking castle so make sure you go out of the building  walk around a bit  We were lucky that there was a Christmas parade  this was the highlight of this visit
5553,5,Family day out Theme park and shopping underground and all the big stores Must visit The tallest tower for lovely views over Seoul
5554,4,At first time Im not expect too much for this place because I think they only have rides just for children and not that big enough But surprisingly this place is sure big enough and have various rides for adult I like Atlantis and French Revolution But unfortunately Flume Ride was out of service when I came Im not a fan of challenging attraction so yeah I skipped for viking and gyro rides
5555,4,Visited Lotte World as part of a tour group package Spent about 4 hours here from 5pm to 9pm Place was semi packed with mostly couples and families Certain attractions such as the horror house and mirror maze requires an additional fee of 3000won to enter  Most of the rides were mild as this is a family theme park Do try the ice skating rink on the lowest floor and there are several food options around to choose from
5556,4,Be prepared to wait in lines and youre fine I visited during super hot August and the lining was horrible However the attractions are fun and different from the ones Ive been in other countries I highly recommend the indoor roller coaster Comet express and Atlantis Adventure roller coaster Just the indoor park itself is a sight to see Go early in the morning if you want to experience everything
5557,4,Lotte world celebrates its 30th anniversary this year 2019 and there are many shows and nice decoration around the theme park to commemorate that The rides are still fun despite some of them being really old and insanely popular
5558,3,The warmth in the indoor theme park was very welcome with the freezing cold outside However the indoor rides were more for smaller kids less than 12 years old probably Very long queues on a holiday and weekend We stayed in an AirBnB across the theme park so transportation was not a problem
5559,3,We spent a Thursday afternoon at Lotte World indoor It is great for the 64 yo that we have but it was so crowded Every ride took a long wait and it felt that rides for small children were all filled by teenagers We spent US150 for ultimately 4 rides and that took us 3 hours and all our energy Safety precautions seemed way over the top eg all had to wear a safety belt in the carrousel
5560,4,Avoid at Christmastime Great place to visit but queuing for 2 hours for most rides took the shine off I dont know how much a magic pass is but I think it would be worth investigating to go to the front of every line
5561,4,Lotte World is a large indoor theme park covering multi stories and including an outdoor area The rides range from kiddie rides through to relatively large roller coasters that older kids will love If youre coming in winter be prepared to layer on and off if youre going to be in or outside  Best to arrive first thing when the crowds are small and queues are short  go to the most popular rides first  Atlantis French Revolution Pharaohs Rage etc otherwise be prepared to queue for up to 2 hours when the crowd builds up especially in the holiday season  The park is clean and well presented and offers a Disneyeque feel complete with their own Snow White Castle  The entry ticket we got 20 off using MasterCard is generally all inclusive a small handful of rides require extra payment There is a range of food from local to western Prices are generally higher than outside  There is a Lotte World app that can book Magic Passes like Disney fast passes but we couldnt get them to work; perhaps they need to be booked first thing So suggest some preplanning is essential to get the best out of the park
5562,4,Spend a full day at this theme park It is crowded especially during this school vacation season They had quite a wide variety of rides to cater to the different age groups It provided enough thrill to keep my 3 teenagers occupied They have plenty food options to satisfy your hunger  Good place esp if you have kids  teenagers 
5563,5,We visited with a 6 and 2 year old  Both had a great time  the oldest went on several rides and the little one enjoyed the carousel and playground It was very busy as it was close to Christmas so we left before taking full advantage of all the rides and activities We loved the Christmas shows
5564,4,Like a kid in a candy store there are so many things to see and wanna try and ride The hot air balloon was amazing  There are performances slotted You need to check with the Information  Lots of eating places and snack bars too  The attraction outside is simply crowded If you can endure the cold weather it is kind of nice But i expected it to be bigger
5565,3,Today is Christmas eve I expected the lotte world will be very crowded therefore I bought the ticket for my kids with unlimited magic pass but when we try to reserve the ride most of the hot attraction magic pass reservation already closed it mean you cannot use magic pass for this attraction End up they need to spend time Q at normal queue I regret to bough the pass because is not cheap For my self self I bought 5 times magic pass and now is 5pm and I only manage to use one still has balance 4
5566,5,It was wonderful and amazing I love the place very creative and colourful My favourite part was the ice skating The best part was the parade with all the fiction characters
5567,4,Indoor and outdoor theme park Good for cold weather as you can just do the indoor rides The museum on location is definitely worth a visit as well Hidden gem Quiet as most of crowd would be at the theme park There are several eateries at the exit of the museum The eatery closest to the entrance of shopping mall offers cheap and good food as compared to the other eateries on the same floor It is small and looks less expensive  food is good value for money
5568,5,While the equipment and rides show signs of age it is a fun place for kids Its mostly I doors so great for cold weather
5569,5,My children love this place indoor and outdoor park However my kids is 7 yrs old and 3 yrs old couldnt play most of the game but still great for this trip definitely will come again hopefully when the children able to play everything
5570,2,Unless youre really desperate to spend money on any average theme park dont go The rides and premises feels old and tattered The crowds are packed and the queues are crazy long 2 hours for a short unexciting roller coaster ride Its also small with limited attractions We were bored stiff despite spending a fortune on the entrance fee
5571,1,Very disappointed Expensive a lot of attractions closed and the best attractions cost extra which is outrageous considering the high entry fee Even the ice skating rink required everyone to vacate after only 10 minutes Overrated overcrowded and totally over the most disappointing theme park our family has visited and we have been to many We lost on Lotte
5572,4,Very strange place but a fun time had overall Initially when entering the park the place seems very small All of the big attractions arent immediately visible Take a few minutes to locate all of the major ridesattractions inside and outside of the park Some of the lines can be very long but hey most theme parks are The indoor section looks very dated and there arent as many spectacular rides Roller coasters are a blast Lots of food options too There is enough to see for an entire day so plan ahead Not a bad option for a day at a theme park
5573,3,Went on a Thursday some rides were undergoing maintenance DO CHECK THE APPWEBSITE BEFORE GOING the rides which were down were some of the main rides long queues for the comet express  french revolution 100 mins there is the magic pass app where you get to try your luck to get an express pass at a specific time slot you can do it at the kiosk too The day I went there were many students there making it crowded  almost 90 were students which was really different from my Everland experience  Food selection was decent its not super big but its good and the location is still in the city which makes it convenient and its near lotte mart for food shopping
5574,4,The theme park is not big but it has all the rides and facilities Most rides are for older child with height more than 110cm We spent some time studying the floor maps because the signage was not very clear It was long queue during winter We tried to use the magic pass but some rides did not accept the pass Anyway all of us were having great fun there The parade was not very interesting We were confused about the direction to get there initially because the area was a combination of mall hotel and park No signage to show us how to go to theme park from sunway The exit of the subway is 1 or 2 And the park was located near the food departmental store
5575,1,Because of the weather the ride numbers are very reduced leaving you with not much to do and very very long lines Do not visit here in winter wait for the warm weather
5576,3,Though I dont ride all the rides I just embraced the view and surrounding a moment when you wish you are young again I dont think is as big as Everland that I heard of bring a huge place but since here the location is great and accessible by using metro when you do not have enough time while in Seoul but just enough to experience the moment of being young at heart
5577,5,I went to Lotte World in October 2018 They have a wide selection of games and activities as well as different restaurants and stores The quality of service is amazing I went on a Wednesday or Thursday afternoon and the place was crowded There are a large selection of private or vip rooms to cater for special occasions and business dinners Cant wait to go back
5578,5,Upon entering the facility it is clearly evident this building offers the full gambit of stores and sporting  eating highlights Whilst the wife does extensive shopping there are numerous coffee shops restaurants cinemas highest lookout in Seoul aquarium play arama and games facilities  ice skating rink
5579,4,What a fun day at Lotte World So many rides and lots to see It is difficult to navigate around There is so much packed in that you dont see all the rides unless you go down every street and every corner It is really tough to find the stairs or escalators as well Lines arent long but the wait to get on a ride takes forever They could introduce more efficientcy by counting passengers while the ride runs and limiting the number of Magic Passes allowed on a ride We went on a Monday and not a super busy day but wait times were 4560 for the more popular rides
5580,5,Actually everything there is amazing but the problem is all the time crowded and alot of people special after 12 pm but in weekend from when lotte world open until close they accept millions of people to much people and if you need to play sometimes you need to wating like one hour for one game or 2 hour i just suggest to visit there but in weekdays spical in middle of the week
5581,5,Reminiscing back our childhood days at this place Was so fantastic that you would say to yourself its nice to be a kid again
5582,5,A place to live enjoy entertain play and shop  The location is convenient being close to meteor station lines 2 and 8  The shopping centre is selfsuficient Wherever you need as a tourist is available  The theam park is a saviour for all ages  Top of the tower is a must to visit At a hight of 420 meters you could enjoy seeing Seoul  The lotte hotel next door complete it Enjoy the 5 star accommodation and resturants  This new and state of the art property is calm get away for families and fresh couples
5583,5,Suitable for kids age 3 and above to enjoy the rides in the indoors  It would take up the whole day
5584,5,Our two boys had so much fun in Lotte World It was Halloween themed  The Virus Rides such as Gyro DropPirate Ship Sinbad were fun We had ice cream and hotdogs Best of all we had fun at the VR area We oldies simulated hang gliding while the two boys took several turns with their war games Best to go to Lotte World when it opens at 930 am get the best out of the trip
5585,4,Park was very gigantic and price is very reasonable Nevertheless after several hours of being inside we started to get bored as the attractions are mostly ordinary Furthermore food is also above average in terms of price
5586,1,Well when we there it was raining so hard and faggy We were stuck in this place It was too noisy too many people students kids it was not for us  what a regret 
5587,4,This theme Park is indoor and temperature controlled The rides are compact along The sides since The skating rink is in The Middle There are about 10 to 15 attractions not including The outdoor Park The rides are varied both thrilling and for kids Roller coaster looks sinbad rides etc Good for adults and kids alike One day is just sufficient to enjoy The place
5588,4,My kids were a little young to enjoy the rides fully 3  5 years old The park attendants are quite strict on the minimum height restrictions Older kids would definitely enjoy more It has both an indoor and outdoor section so was good for the colder months
5589,4,The Lotte World in Seoul is an Amusement Park in its own If you like water activities and other fun amusement it is worth spending time there As it is not cheap you should allow time for best value for money
5590,4,We went here with a young infant so didnt explore outside as none of the rides would be suitable for our baby Being indoors meant that we could still go there even though it was a rainy day Lots to do at Lotte World There are lots of restaurants and lots of shopping opportunities I would recommend coming here with young kids although it can get very busy
5591,4,Its a fantastic place if youre travelling with older kids Theres a whole floor for younger kids which we only found later in the afternoon Queues were crazy on the Friday we visited due to schoolgoing kids of all ages So if youre really keen on getting on the rides on a Friday or weekend do check it they sell fast passes But definitely do avoid Fridays and weekends if you can We went back to Lotte World for Pororo Park on Thursday and it was really rather quiet so do consider going on a weekday
5592,5,If happen anyone in Seoul Korea  Im highly recommend this cafe for tiramisu at basement foods area  This cafe specialise In Tiramisu Theres variety of choices for tiramisu  The best recommended and my favourite is the mix berries and chocolate ones  Check it out from the photo for the cafe name
5593,5,I was unwell right at the start of my two weeks working trip in Seoul Upon knowing of my condition since 13 Oct 2018 the Club Lounge staff had been very concerned each time they see me and during breakfasts would recommend what to drink and eat to better manage the condition of my extreme throat inflammation Specifically on the 13 Oct 2018 morning the two Club Lounge staff had helped to find the nearest clinic for me upon request and followed up with me on their own accord an hour later if I was going to the clinic Another special mention would be the male lobby senior staff who upon my inquiry of direction brought me to the clinic for fear I might find it difficult to locate  Very thankful for the concern and dedication of the hotel staff during my visit to Korea this time Grateful to have made the acquaintance of the hotel staff  Regards Room 3002 Guest 8 to 18 Oct 2018
5594,4,Long queues everywhere and it is quite confusing to use their app to book the timeslot for the rides as there are no instructions on how to book for foreigners  Aside from that it is quite interesting and fanciful Theres restaurants and shops inside for you to shop your worth while you are there
5595,3,This place is a large impressive shopping mall with everything from vans the Louis Vuitton If youre an expat theres also an On the Border so you can get a Tex mex fix Great for people watching too
5596,5,A big place to explore that is suitable for everyone in the family  Theme Park perfect for family Lotte Mart a great shopping place to get all your stuff from household to food items  Lotte Departmental great selections of mid to high end brands are available  Lots of varieties of restaurants and cafes are available 
5597,3,If you have recently visited Disneyland I would say dont come here The place is small and crowded The queues are long and sometimes they cut off the magic passes Do not pay the full price if you decide to go Use sites like Trazy or Klook and get your discount passes foreign passport holders only The kids had a fun time but for adults not so much The only saving grace for us was that we did get some nice photos of the kids Also do go early and avoid weekendsholidays if you can
5598,4,Sweet little theme park that is not overblown Good for kids big kids and adults who are kids inside Great way to enjoy a day  Lotte World theme park is not overly crowded Most rides will require about 3050mins to line up for Indoor activities are quite numerous but are aimed at younger audiences Be warned some 4D rides can get you very dizzy Outside is fun but can get colder at night  No extreme thrill rides such as a crazy roller coaster and some rides are notin operation AppWeb is not updated about statusThey have some theme halloween but arent as committed as other parks Lotte mascots are not as relatable to foreigners
5599,4,the theme park is very good especially the rides though there are rides that takes time because of the long line waiting to get to the ride but all in all the experience is memorable
5600,2,We visited the park on a Saturday and it was very crowded and busy  without fast pass we had to queue about an hour for each ride We gave up after two rides  and went shopping at the lotte supermarket instead 
5601,4,We had a spare day during a recent tour of Korea so decided to spend it at lotte world Got some tickets online with a massive discount the night before collection was easy Was pretty amazed by the spectacle of the whole site really rides are designed for kids rather than adults but we found the outside ones a but more adult Very much enjoyed our day but it was very busy with long lines for all rides Food and drink was farely priced considering it is a theme park Is it a must see thing in Seoul maybe not buy none the less we did have a great day
5602,2,My hubby accompanied my mumin law to the toilet  And my SIL did inform the staff that they went to the toilet prior to queueing When they returned they refused to let my hubby boarded the ride and simply showed us a card that we cant cut queue In the end they only allowed my MIL to go up  Separately we were queueing behind for the second cabin I asked if they allowed my hubby to join us again they refused I told them 45 persons are allowed and we only have 4 persons here And the same reason we are not supposed to cut queue  Nothing fanastic about their rides  bad service  For Singaporean or Malaysian who are visiting Seoul my advise is you can give this amusement park a miss  Personally Prefer disneyland and Universal studio
5603,1,Was really disappointed with this It looks good but thats about it All the rides indoors are for young children despite waiting in lines for 30 mins filled with teens and adults The outside rides are proper rides but a 2 min ride doesnt really seem worth lining up half an hour For tourists if you have limited time I wouldnt recommend this English is also a bit limited here
5604,5,So i went on a friday and it was very crowded with a kids in school visits but the rides on the outdoor are the best for adults  if you have kids and want them to have some fun go indoor The lines in the outdoor are long and tiring however the rides are very enjoyable You are advised to go from tuesday to thursday if you want to avoid crowds and also avoid public holidays at all costs
5605,4,Very nice place for families and young guys Many games and attractive shows Full of fun and enjoyment Must try it
5606,5,Huge Alot of shops there and alot of things to do Prepare your cash Alot of shopping till you drop
5607,5,Lotte world was one of the best indooroutdoor theme park weve been It has so much to offer for persons of all ages Rides indoors are more for the kids while rides outdoors are for the extremes 1 day is not enough Its situated in the city of seoul other places near it was the lotte mall lotte aquarium and lotte tower the highest in Skorea and 5th in the world
5608,5,I spend 1 week at the lotte World hotel Jasmine location The hotel is extremely clean but what makes this hotel stand out is their staff  one of the best customer service I received  especially if you meet Rain and Suzie who worked at the executive club They went above and behind to make my stay an excellent onealso location location location 1 minute walking to the subway I will defiantly rate this hotel 45 stars Kansameda lotte staff
5609,1,My last visit was 3 years ago and found a very different now Staff not friendly does not know what is inside too crowded very noisy not clean Chiniese visitors were making alot of noise It was a big surprise for me Will never visit and shopping again
5610,4,We decided to go to Lotte World since we visited South Korea during Summer time We were informed that this amusement park had an indoor and outdoor area so we could just choose which area we would like to check  Once inside the indoor park you wouldnt feel you are inside an amusement park instead a shopping mall for the children Haha true enough it was airconditioned which was very helpful during Summer time There were a lot of rides and entertainment there but we just didnt have the time to experience it all  We went inside the Fantasy Forest if i remember it correctly which btw you would have to pay extra 2000 KRW to enter since our ticket didnt mention that it was included No worries though since my 2 year old son loved seeing the various animals that were inside  I think adults and kids alike would love to spend an entire day here since you could actually find a lot of rides and things to do here
5611,3,Lotte world is good for Kids at heart  Still fun but if you been to universal or disneyland you will be disappointed  Good thing with Lotte world though is mall is just right there too with a bunch of places to shop for  But entrace is quite expensive if you buy there in the spot find some cheap ticket online  Food wise its good theres various selection  Jamsil station is right there as well and they have lockers on the train station 
5612,5,Even though Im not a child I loved it great place to take kids lotto world is located inside a shopping mall so theres always plenty of things to do it has alot of rides shows and food i do recommand to see lotto world especially if you have kids
5613,3,Lotte is a wellknown chain in Korea and its hotels have a somewhat formulaic uniformity Lotte World has a rather dated feel and look  it was probably the bees knees twenty or thirty years ago but doesnt seem to have moved with the times The staff during my stay were impeccable  polite and efficient if rather lacking in warmth My double room was comfortable functional and equipped with the sort of items that one needs and expects in a hotel of this level but faded The wallpaper and carpet looked as though they should have been changed years ago and the shower over the bath tub was a HeathRobinson arrangement The corridor carpets were equally in need of changing and the space was pervaded by a musty smell that may be a legacy of the days when smoking was common in the corridors and rooms I didnt think much of the dining options a Chinese place on a high floor which I didnt try and a buffet place on the second floor which I did The hotel lacks a simple coffee shop type restaurant where one can order a simple dish from a menu There are plenty of better hotel options in Seoul
5614,5,Visited one weekday in December but I guess it was school holidays it was so so crowded The kids went crazy at this place lots of kids ride and the queue was long for each activity We spent one full day here We did not play the outdoor activities as it was freezing cold Hope to pay this place a visit soon
5615,4,Besides waiting 25 hours in a line up for a roller coaster wearing virtual reality goggles the first thing we did getting off the ride was get back in line for a further 3 hours to do it again It was a memorable time but allow yourself a full day
5616,4,This place provided for a fun day for our family The key is to get the Free Pass  Premium Pass  This allows you to cut to the front of the line and unlike the Magic Pass it is unlimited and there is no need to make reservations using the app At 100000 Won it is not cheap so we purchased just for the kids they are now raving about Lotte World Otherwise I think the long lines hour or more at times would have seriously interfered with the fun  It is also a good idea to get to Lotte World early as the atmosphere is calmer and not as crowded
5617,4,This is an indoor theme park which is good for kids aged 411 years old Half a day will be enough
5618,4,Very crowded on the weekend My 6 years old did enjoyed it as we changed plan from a private city tour to half city half Lotte world day because it was too hot to walk around palaces and other tourist spots I felt the indoor amusement park could have been cooler but with the outside heat and too many peoples inside made the AC seem it wasnt working well Lines are long minimum 30 minutes wait Wish I bought the magic pass that could of save us lots of time Final thought been there done that and will not come back
5619,4,We arrived about 15 minutes before opening on a hot Wednesday morning We ran first for the Atlantis coaster one of the most popular rides at Lotte World and after our ride the line was already very long Other attractions include several more coasters including a virtual reality one called French Revolution a monorail and an ice skating rink The rest of the park was also enjoyable although eventually we got bored and left at around 4 pm This park is not recommended for thrill seekers rather it is best for families couples and high school groups
5620,5,Lotte Workd is lots of fun Rudes for all ages Well kept amusement oark Fun to see different kinds of rides Good food Very friendly employees
5621,4,Well like many theme parks this smaller than Disney indoor them park but very nice especially during summer It has a lot of entertaining activities like trains air balloon and some festival performances if you havent been to doesnt before this is a mini introduction  Manal Oman
5622,1,Never ever will I again buy Magic Pass You must reserve your Magic Pass at a kiosk or app Never worked All reservations for ALL rides were closed
5623,5,I went there a lot of times and I never get tired of Lotte World  There are a lot of attractions and theyre not too scary so its perfect for little childs Its an adventure park on the inside of a building so its not hot in sunny days  I often go there on sunny days so I can stay in the inside with some fresh air  Its better not to go the weekend because there are too many people Every evening there is a parade and I really enjoyed it  I will certainly go back
5624,5,Shopping food and entertainment Must do the tower and get a great view of the city It does not disappoint
5625,5,The place is massive Would recommend to get a vip pass so you do not have to wait in line The rides are expectacular They got both outdoor and indoor rides I would say people at different age will enjoy this place There are rides that the kids will enjoy and there are rides for the thrill seeker as well Lots of restaurant and food stalls to choose from
5626,3,Good amusement park and the best thing is that most of it is indoors So you can enjoy irrespective of weather conditions  But seems to have become old and charges additional for certain attractions  Fireworks are indoors as well and are not comparable to what one would see in say Disney
5627,5,Last time we were here was 23 years ago making it as our 2nd stay here Our vacation this time is longer than our first time in Seoul We stayed in Myeongdong and Busan first before transfering here As expected everything is still in tip top condition Everything is accessible Train restaurants 711 malls and even lotte world which is my kids favorite place to be Staffs were polite and helpful Will still be back here on our next trip to Seoul
5628,4,Disney meets asia with this gem From water slides to roller coasters along with a massive ice skating ring this little commercial gem will not disappoint The flying advertising drones do not distract and are a fun part of the ambiance Plenty to see and interaction makes for a fun family experience
5629,1,The bad reviews for this place is correct Waste of time and mony 60 aussie dollars to get in and too busy to get on a ride where u have to pay moreeee
5630,3,The mall has everything you need and big shops also a cinema With the biggest display in the world But the price for parking and the parking situation on busy days is ridiculous and a poor statement Also the food market is on busy days too full With the good restaurants you have to wait an hour
5631,1,Visited this week and what a nightmare Expect  Lines we could count 1h for the train touring 2mins accross the main square or another 1h for the baby fairy boat Non working app  useless premium price paid; could book 1 ride with the quick pass on the full day Amazing food system  want 1 coke 1 cofee and 1 ice cream to have all family happy  Queue 3 times in three outlets each time 10mins Indoor park   yep but as outside is 38 degrees each client stay in only and AC was not sufficient for the place and croud   Expectin a day to create memories got a day with nightmare and unhappy familly  just do not go there not worth a cent would not go back even if for free
5632,5,The good thing about it  it has and indoor part that is air conditioned to keep U cold during the day  Tickets are expensive and some rides inside are not included  Great place for kids and adults alike 
5633,2,A typical theme park but pretty aged A lot of walking and not really a lot of choices on food Perhaps it is good for teens but cant really compare with Disney or Universal Studio
5634,5,This was a great place to take our kids 9  13 Theres 4 floors of rides and games Theres also a lot of fun thrilling rides outside the building that kids and adults will have fun on We spent about 8 hours here just playing games and ice skating
5635,2,We are not users of theme or amusement parks so not up on the pricing but took my kids for our sons birthday Getting in the door is what you pay for with the entry ticket Rides cost extra  every single one While reach ride doesnt cost a fortune it would soon add up if your kids are adventurous I left feeling totally ripped off Should have researched it better
5636,3,there are lots of things to do at this theme park it is very loud by my standards but also a must see experience I wish ice skating was included
5637,5,I have stayed here at least 56 times and every time the staff in the hotel at the club lounge are excellent  Great service always smiling positive feelings for guests The manager and his team are very friendly and helpful  Rooms are nice and quiet with molten brown amenities Same old nice touch with no reduction in quality  always of a high standard  Breakfast and the evening snacks are superb High quality food always  Kloud beer bar at the basement is also very nice and not overly priced  Location is super as you have a subway Jamsil station and a super mall beside and the new 123 floor little observation tower  Only gripe is the tax refund people  not part of the hotel  are rude The young lady needs some training to be more polite to tourists who pay your salary and reason for your job If you are still rude to such tourists who are your customers then you will be out of a job Be nice I dont owe you money and I can return your tax if you feel that you deserve it I pay high taxes back home too just so you know
5638,3,Nice place for children a lots of game available inside and outside the park for all ages  there is also show from 8pm to 830 pm and all games stop at the show time
5639,4,I visited the lotte world around january but do not worry about the cold weather because this place has indoor area and the game variation is very much from children under 5 years old until adult games are all available in lotte world many souvenir shops here the point to take pictures is also quite a lot  the price of admission depends on the choice of game if you want cheaper choose a ticket with limited game not all can be played lotte world is located inside the mall so if the parents get tired of waiting then it can walk way in the mall
5640,5,I went there with my wife and 6 years boy We spent all day here from open to close It was really fun and lots of things to do Enough to spend whole day And if you stay lotte hotel next to it you can buy discount coupon for all day free pass Must visit place if you visit seoul
5641,5,Hotel Lotte was a bit old but very well maintained The character room gave good excitement to my sons; 6  8 especially due to its Wii Service is also excellent I emailed them in advance to enquire about the beds since I only managed to book nonsuite character room with 2 twin beds but they helped me to get a room with a queen bed and a single bed with trundle which is exactly what I need  The location is indeed convenient from the Lotte theme park which is in the mall next door with a connecting passage  Price is on the high side but with all benefits above its quite worth it Will come back again
5642,4,This is an ok theme park Appreciated that there is an indoor area when the weather gets too hot or rainy during the summer season Went on a Friday and was quite surprised that the queues were not that long Though the park was quite big I find that there are more things to do at Everland Enjoyed the street and stage performances throughout the day The food choices are ok Would have been better if the park access includes the skating rink area as I believe it costs extra to try out
5643,5,We spent the whole day in this theme park with 4 kids under 6 2 seniors and 4 adults Had a great time enjoying the Lotte theatre shoe the samba parade which was the current theme and the many rides Theres also a outdoor extension to Magic land Very decent rides there; I played the bungee and gyro drop Queue was manageable except for the few games that everyone garners for Atlantis at Magic land looks like the most popular and Aeronauts hot air balloon and flume ride were also popular Otherwise  we had an enjoyable experience with a day at the park
5644,4,I dont know why people say the queues are so bad they could hardly ride  We went early in the morning and went on the French Revolution twice without queuing for more than 5 mins bad idea cos one can get really dizzy on that ride  I recommend going for Atlantis for your first ride as that ride is by far the most popular Queue was 40 min or so but if you buy the magic pass from klook you can breeze straight to the front and beat the queue If you wish you can use all your magic passes here prob the best cos the other queues are not as long as this  We bought 5 magic passes We went on every single ride French Revolution 3x Atlantis 3 or 4x gyro spin swing drop a couple of times Conquistador 4x  If you download the app you can get some free magic passes these are timed and released every hour and you could use these for the less popular rides We never managed to use the free app magic passes for the popular ones cos they were always sold out so we gave up  Enjoy yourselves The queues are not that bad But please go early
5645,5,A good place people must visit there is everything from food groceries restaurants electronic audio white goods good quality garments etc etc During the visit I was lucky because there was 50 discount on garments like Zara and others even on sport garments
5646,5,Lotte World is huge with both indoor and outdoor attractions so do plan to spend the whole day there The Fly Venture and Upside down wheel were my favourite rides Stay for the night parade and indoor fireworks  fun for the kids Nice view from the hot air balloon rides
5647,3,Good Its a nice attraction for families and teenagers The focus inside is more on smaller kids but outside my teenage girl had lots of fun  The park is in good condition It looks very safe and well maintained  Negative When I pay an entrance fee of 50 USD I dont understand why some of the very simple attractions require an extra payment I found this very disappointing and a little fraudulent  If your staff is sad and depressed as they look please dont let them wave always their hands It looks strange to me if some is waving the hands to me and looking depressed
5648,4,the park is old you can see it with some of the rides but well maintained a protion is indoor which is wonderful on a sunny day and there is also a outdoor portion where the more extreme and newer ride is located
5649,5,You can kill 2 duck with one shot  Get to Lotte World and you can get to the top at 555m and see Seoul from different angles Also the entire district around it is one kind  youll see it  Also enjoy a complete different shopping experience  good food court even an aquarium if you fancy to submerge  A bit far if youre staying at Seoul downtown but defo it worth it  Dont forget to download Citymaper at your app store and enjoy
5650,4,We went on a Monday and arrived slightly before 10am Stayed right through to 5pm Tips  entrance tickets  for foreign visitors i think its better to purchase the entrance tickets onlinebefore hand  we got our tickets at SGD36 per person adult or child alike redemption is at the south gate  look for the counter that says overseas admission it is not the ticket counter that is outside it is located after the main doors  Magic pass i contemplated purchasing the tickets that comes with magic pass but decided not too and didnt regret my choice  as we arrived fairly early on a monday morning  crowds were thin  didnt have to wait more than 15 mins in the morning  we downloaded the Lotte World App  the app gives u 3 free magic passes per ticketholder  we managed to redeem 2 of the 3 magic passes  Crowd  after 2pm  the crowds started to stream in  and thats when the queue starts to form especially for popular rides like the FLUME ride  so for the popular rides u may wish to redeem your magic pass early we didnt know that and when we tried to redeem our 3rd magic pass in the afternoon for the popular ride  the reservation has closed so please note  overall  my child enjoyed the rides  especially the VR rides and had a fun time  for the price we paid  i thought it was worth it
5651,4,Negatives  Outside lines are long waits which is especially difficult in the freezing winters  There are not that many rides  Positives  Lotte Market is right outside the amusement park  Some of the rides are very different where they use technology and 4D  There are a variety of rides for people of different ages  Able to spend a whole day at Lotte World
5652,3,Indoor rides are limited as 3 popular rides were closed down with no reason provided Inconsistent with the staff service as some staff require tourists to present entrance pass documents before getting on the rides One of the level 2 rides the staff pushed my son away and dropped him on the ground for refusal entry when the passes were with my hubby in another ride with my daughter I found this attitude and service quite bad as a two yrold child was excited for the ride and being treated in this manner Not as if the ride having long Q I explained that we will show the pass tickets later after the ride as my child is crying with disappointment after such treatment
5653,3,Within the city With both indoor and outdoor  Its pretty crowded even on weekday  I prefer Everland I like the pretty flowers and decor depending on season  But if you have limited time visit Lotte World
5654,5,Love this shopping mall went during a cold winter u can basically find anything there Parking is pricey Lotte mart i outstanding
5655,5,I read couple reviews before going and I kept asking myself what would people do there for so many hours I know now after leaving when 11th hour passed  This spot just keeps throwing fun at you and it wont stop  Ticket price is about 50k won per adult but what you get inside makes up for the price
5656,5,I bought ticket from Klook for Lotte World Aquarium and Lotte World Adventure both we had an enjoyable experience although the theme park seems already dated as some paints were peeling off but overall it was great  We super enjoyed the photo booths at level 4 of the theme park as it has different themes in each block
5657,3,This theme park has outdoor and indoor area We went there on weekday and it was super packed with the teenager students whose wearing uniform Actually not quite sure how the education system here works But based on my experience not really recommended if you are taking too young kid to this place neither elder due to huge distance also too many floors in the building Its confusing place as they do not provide the map at the outdoor entrance We had to figured out on our own at the end of the day we found the entrance from the mall and the map was there plus no information to inform the tourist if they were busy with a big tour group We were disappointed with the management team here on careless Free WiFi here sucks it doesnt really work mostly unable to connect Ticket will be cheaper in the afternoon but I dont think I want to be back again doesnt worth the money
5658,4,Was there for a day Good for families and there is both indoors and outdoors things to play Got to stay for the night parade as its worth it and its nice
5659,5,We came here late Thursday morning and there was almost no queue at all the rides Think the crowd came in about 2pm or so however queue length is still relatively ok at 3040mins  Generally the indoor parts are for kids and outdoor rides are more older kids or adults  We bought our tickets from the internet and managed to cut the ticket queue however we still need to exchange for real tickets at the South Gate and only there Signage was quite bad and it took us about 1520 mins to locate it  Within the theme park again signage can be improved as we find ourselves circling around look for the specific rides  All in all it was still fun enough for us to go around without lunch for 8 hours  Cannot be compared to Disney or universal studios but good enough for us
5660,3,Ok if youre from the US like I am and are used to going to big theme parks like Universal studios six flags and disneyland then youre going to be disappointed If you rarely go to large theme parks then youll like lotte world I really didnt like lotte world because it was so tiny that I could cover the entire amusement park in under 4 hours I dont know about other countries but in America disneyland is so huge that it takes a whole day just to cover one section of the park Compared to the disneyland in LA lotte world is like 110 the size Its just so tiny and the rides were not really thrilling at all The horror house was literally a 10 minute 3D video for 5 year olds If you have young kids then lotte world wouldnt be a bad choice but if youre over 15 years old I suggest everland over lotte world
5661,4,This amusement is vertically huge ranges from b3 to 4th floor It can be very confusing when you first reach there Be sure to get a copy of the map at the info counter after you enter located at 1st floor  I entered by the south gate and arrived at the 1st floor playground for young children They cater rides to kids below the height of 100cm and there were variety  If you walk further towards the centre of the theme park on 1st floor you reached the place where the carousel and viking is There are other rides on 1st floor for older kids and adults Most rides height requirement is about 110cm The more thrilling ones probably above 130cm  2nd floor leads to the outdoor theme park where most of the thrill rides are There are also lots of cafes and restaurants on the 2nd floor indoors as well as 2 other adventure rides  3rd floor houses another 3 more adventure rides and 4th floor is where the hot air ballon ride is  Well its really crazily big and we didnt have the time to complete all the rides as we were rushing off to the aquarium Spent a total of 6 hrs there Study the map plan your time wisely and you will be able to get on most rides Magic pass that helps skip queues save time But sometimes the queue for magic pass can also be quite long for popular rides  Comparatively I prefer everland as it is an outdoor theme park and there is a zoo within the park itself Also it is easier to locate the rides in everland
5662,4,Admittedly Im not sure if we got lucky or whatever but it was a Tuesday There were kids on their field trip there but despite that there were no lines Majority of it is indoors with a train that goes around the indoor area and around the outdoor area too That said it was rather fun and this coming from a guy that doesnt particularly enjoy theme parks Just be aware that the B3 entertainments with the VR and ice skating know that those do NOT come with your entrance so dont be surprised if you need to pay extra for those
5663,5,After days of shopping we reserve a day for the kids We went by train The Lotto World was huge It is located in a mall Find the signed that show Lotto World Adventure There are outdoor and indoor Weather was hot so we stayed indoor first There are rides for whole family as well as children The waiting time can be up to an hour kids enjoyed the day
5664,2,Just a regular amusement park in the city The waiting lines for the rides are very long There are couple of nice rides but the rest are very simple and common rides This place is a one time only visit place Considering that Korea is an IT advanced country this is just an old amusement park
5665,3,This theme park was good in many ways but expensive for what you get  It honestly reminded me of when Pinocchios carnival went bad Something is just a little bit off with this theme park  Green monkeys people in mascarade masks strange performances    The rides are kind of fun but be prepared to wait a while in the hot indoor area  We paid extra to ice skate and that was fun for the kids  All in all this park was bizarre Its like a strange knock off of Disneyland
5666,5,Its seem like Disneyland from the outside but its more like a theme parkJust a fun place to visit definitely worth a visit
5667,4,Huge shopping center with all brands from all the World ; four floors of shopping and eating  clean and good connect
5668,4,We went with a guided tour so we were pressed for time We only managed 3 rides There is something for everyone like the Aeronauts Balloon Ride to see the city a hotair balloon ride for younger kids Older kids can go to the Tomb of Death and Pharaohs Furyfind the hidden treasure Younger kids can also enjoy the Jumping Fishescape the shark;jump vigoursly at corners and boat rides There is limited space in the fishes in the Jumping Fish ride so parents who want to accompany their kids beware of your knees There are three bumper cars one for kids the other for children taller than 140cm Both only seat one person and for the kid one  parents are not allowed The average wait there is 25 mins while a ride is approximately anywhere between 6  20mins The Lotte Aquarium is a short walk away and Lotte Hotel is just outside perfect for families with kids as kidzania is a stones throw away Overall awesome will come again
5669,3,Overall the visit was ok It was a little overwhelming at first as the place had the outdoor portion and indoor part with four levels There was also poor description of the rides hence you had no idea what to expect for some of the indoor rides This place has quite a bit of height restrictions for kids 56 years old So if youre below 110cm you basically cannot take most of the rides even though if the kid is game for it The kid would have to take the really baby rides Good to do some research before heading to the park
5670,2,feels just a normal amusement park with rides nothing fantastic The outdoor is not siutable for kids under 7 years old the merchandise store selection is miserable  and you cant reenter once you exit the theme park Doesnt give you the connection like what Disneyland gave
5671,5,Lottes department stores are incredible with up to 17 floors of every type of merchandise you could wish for It is not only a store but a real experience with marvellous facilities for keeping families amused whilst bargain hunting British department stores could really benefit from seeing how these work
5672,5,This place is like Disneyland on steroids It has both rides indoors and out which is great incase it rains  Its also located inside Lotte Mall arguably the greatest mall in existence Theres a Hard Rock Cafe here and many different shops and even exhibits to see Theres even an aquarium  Lotte world itself is great Some of the best and crazies rides Ive ever been on Definitely recommend getting one of their waffle sandwiches waffles cream and fruit sauce I recommend apple located outside near the Drop of Doomtype ride  Great options for food Great for vegetarians and vegans The Panda Express just inside as youre coming in from the outside portion it should be on your right has a tofu stir fry
5673,4,This place is full of people Waiting time goes from 60mins to 240mins for French Revolution VR It is a very tiring day of waiting as most theme parks are  My tip will be to download their MagicPass app Go to setting and change the language Register your tickets For us we had 3 magic passes included with our tickets Then from there you can book your magic pass for 3 rides You can also view the waiting time for the rides real time  Sadly for us we figured this out when we were in the middle of our visit so all schedules were filled
5674,5,Here is a very nice Have a lot of thing that you can join and play I been here from1000 AM until 700PM I buy a one day ticket it very nice I want to go there again
5675,5,I have been to many theme parks around the world but i had a lot of fun in Lotte World even though the rides are not extreme at all Its just a fun place in general and something different to do when you are not busy doing all the cultural activities We ended up going after 4pm to take advantage of the cheaper tickets as we didnt think we needed a whole day anyway We spent around 5 hours here during a weekday and we managed to visit all the main rides although one or two rides were out of service The only problem we had was that we enjoyed trying to cram in as many rides as possible that by the time we finished up we realised the park was closing and all food and snack shops were closing up You wont need more than 5 hours here in this park and its very easy to reach by MRT And also just take note around 8pm there is a parade that happens inside which is quite cool but it means a lot of the rides will close down for the duration of this 2030 minute parade
5676,2,Had time to kill Lots of young kids good for them Queues were long on a week day and rides maintained but need updates
5677,1,We reached there at around 2pm and wanted to stay till the night as the park opens late for that day The day has been gloomy thus we have already expected all outdoor attractions to be closed Upon reaching we saw that most attractions had queues of 80min and up We proceeded to utilize the magic pass mobile app in hopes to snag a magic pass however the app was loading the whole time and could not even get us to the landing page  We went on to walk around the premises to see if there were attractions with shorter queue As we walked on the app finally loaded and we checked on waiting time to see a few attractions 015min wait Upon rushing it were we told that the ride was under maintenance which was why the app reflected such a short waiting time  The park had similar naming rides that we rushed in order to make it in time for the magic pass only to know that we were at the wrong location After an hour or so we so frustrated by whats happening that we went to the customer service counter to see what else Lotte World could offer We were shocked to know that at the point of our query only a total of 8 rides and they were all kiddie attractions or lesser were available as all the others were under maintenance  I cant imagine heading into a theme park and wanting out so badly due to what is happening We were there for 3hours 1 hour was spent on lunch and the remaining 2 was spent finding and getting rejected from rides The good thing out of the whole situation we managed to get on 1 ride which we thought were for adults but nope it wasnt
5678,5,Tips Book in advanced Get a Magic Pass to skip the long queue you still need to fall in line though but magic pass holders are kind of priority Be there early Some of the rides close early the Magic pass lane Download their app so you can plan what time and which ride you want to do first  Wear your most comfortable shoes  The best rides for me though French Revolution Atlantis Pharoahs fury Gyro drop  Bungee drop  If we have more time and magic pass Id still want to try sinbad log fume carousel etc as they have good reviews But we only have 5 pass and were too tired lol
5679,4,A great day out with kids lots of rides for kids over 120cm and a fair few where you have to be over 150cm The place was rather busy even on a weekday there seems to be a lot of school excursions at the park There were a lot of eateries to choose from and involves a lot of walking so comfortable shoes are recommended They also had a parade happening which was quite exciting to watch and have a big ice skating ring We purchased our tickets online which had to be redeemed from the south gate which was a small walk before we could enter Overall a good day out for kids guess its Seouls answer to Disneyland
5680,5,We had a very nice day here It was a very rainy day and we want to give it a try And we could spend the hall day here easy so many rides for an indoor park
5681,5,the lotte tower is a must see and this place was nearby neat place to visit if you are with children
5682,4,Everything you can dream of is there beauty wise with great counters load of staff and good prices Mix of modern and traditional architecture
5683,4,Dont eat TGIFriday it is over priced there are more food vendors around the corner Overall rides are fun The wait time could be a bit long
5684,5,I went to this place Really lovely  its one of the biggest indoor adventure parc You can evwn go in rainyday
5685,5,Family with kids should also go to this place And if the adults do take rides there are many that suits them as well  Tickets to the theme park are quite reasonable Can get them at some apps Do get from the apps cos I think it is cheaper than onsite  There is also a Pororo park which needs to pay another entrance fee onsite Cant remember how much but quite reasonable as well If you have kids aged 26yrs it will be best suitable  Do not forget there is an outdoor theme park rides as well But this is more suitable for adults and bigger kids
5686,4,We actually spent 2 hours at the ice skating rink We had so much fun as we came from Guam a tropical island in the Pacific The facility was clean Rules and procedures were easy to follow We are going back another day on this trip to get more practice and to visit the many others entertainment areas
5687,4,My kids were so excited to visit Lotte Worldso many attractions for an indoor themepark Sad that the balloon ride was closed when we visited The price was expensive for an indoor place but I got my tickets through Klookcom it was about 50 off The outside rides by the castle are mostly for bigger kids The ice skating rink is so huge Lots of places to eat inside including TGIF resto
5688,5,We were here for a day and there is so much to do We were in the area mostly to see the Cherryblossom Festival so it was a convenient place to park The amusement park looks awesome but we didnt go inside The lake next to the mall is beautiful and it was a great walk going around both sides It is lined with cherry blossom trees this time of year and my wife was in heaven The mall has a lot of highend stores and was interesting to visit but we were there for the restaurants and shops in the lower levels after the walk around the lake Definitely recommend if you are visiting Seoul
5689,4,One of the best theme par the i recommend to visit Which is also connected to a gorgeous cherry blossom trees park  It is outer and Inner themed park In case of cold weather enjoy the inner rides  Babies under 3 are free to enter with about 4 three rides Other wise pay 14000W to enjoy the rest of the rides  There are two choices all day ticket and after 4 ticket  You dont need to take food with you as there Are a variety of restaurants TGI Friday is having a very huge branch Also snacks are available
5690,4,The indoor amusement park is perfect for those who prefer to stay out of the elements ex Rain cold or heat There were some rides for kids and adults in addition to amusement park snacks The hot balloon ride is only for standing however you get a good view of the entire indoor area The rides were fun and thrilling
5691,4,To be honest I have been to Lotte world many time when I was younger After 6 years visiting again feel like this place is getting old as I am Some of the ride had light upgrade a few new ride but majority of rides are stayed exact same and need some touch up in my opinion  I visit there on Monday expecting little less people than the weekend but there was so many people  so each ride takes long waiting of course My kids had enjoyed I am sure but for the price I paid it was so so in my opinion Not the best place for toddler for sure
5692,4,Lotte World is a really wellmade park we went there with our family on a Friday and it really wasnt that crowded compared to other theme parks  We got the 5ride magic pass wristband and I can tell you that it is totally worth it For some of the rides they let us enter from the exit and enter the ride from there  Overall the scenery was ok but some of the rides had a really nice atmosphere to them Dragon shooting and Phahoras Fury were just a few examples of rides that everyone in your family could enjoy 
5693,5,We have spend all the day its fun and big area indoor and outdoor too many cool games it will cast 50000 won for full day 
5694,5,Great place to shop Theres a big duty free shop inside which is spacious and lots of things Worth a visit if u need duty free products
5695,1,The park itself is ok Not huge but some good rides both indoor and outdoor Like some people who dont mind paying a bit extra for fast passes we paid for extra Magic Passes But using them proved impossible You have to download their app to make reservations These reservations close every time the very few slots have been allocated For a first timer with young family we did not realize that we need to literally stalk the app every 15 mins to secure those precious slots And for one reason or another the navigation is super unintuitive for the first couple of times Since the slots are gone literally 3 seconds after each time period opens its a race of fast fingers  Of our couple of hours there we couldnt get on that many And as the family leader I found myself being a slave to the stupid app rather than being able to fully enjoy myself  Would have asked for a refund for those unused stupid Magic Passes if staff could speak more English  Will not return
5696,5,Fantastic quality and service excellent food and great staff at super modern complex with indoor and outdoor options
5697,2,I had heard that Lotte World is one of the busiest amusement parks in the world apart from Disney and Universal Studios parks So we decided to visit it Honestly its not a good amusement park I would advise people to not go I have not been to Everland but surely it cant be worse The only reason I can think that Lotte World is busy is that it is in the city centre area beside 3 or 4 big shopping malls so I guess people who are around find it convenient to visit But I cant imagine anyone going for more than 1 visit And I dont recommend that anyone visit it even once  The indoor part of Lotte World feels like a bunch of mediocre amusement park rides have been shoved into a shopping mall on 34 floors Making matters worse there is a bit of a bad smell around the space We went on a few rides in the indoor part a dinosaur shooting one and a flight simulator one  they were somewhat copies of Disneyland rides but not even 14 as good  The outside area of Lotte World was not very big connected via a bridge over the highway There is a castle in the middle copy of disneyland and the main thrill rides seemed to be the rides that either go from side to side like a ricking ship ride or that spin We didnt go in tot the haunted house as I read a review to avoid it We went on a Monday and the wait for those averagelooking thrill rides was 40 minutes Those rides remind me of oldstlye travelling amusement parks that go to various cities with basic rides Really there is not much more than that from what we could see at Lotte World  It was a real letdown We left very early
5698,4,We went there during light snow fall so most of the outside rides were closed The inside area was a bit small but was still fun
5699,5,The best themed Park in the city The best thing is that you have indoors and outdoors activities as well as attractions for all the family
5700,5,Lotte World Adventure was awesome As my 2nd day of Seoul I made plan with my friends when we were in our country which was me and my friends enjoy Lotte World Adventure and then go to Lotte tower near Lotte world But we couldnt make it unfortunately There were so many people in Lotte world so we had to wait for a long time like 40 min per a ride However we really really had fun in Lotte cause there are plenty of rides which look cool Plus the happiest thing was that we got discount 20 of oneday Free Pass Ticket via Visit Korea Mastercard We thought that the ticket price is a bit expensive honestly but my friend found the link of Visit Korea Mastercard so we could get 20 off How cool We used the ticket as much as we can At the end we were in Lotte world all day long till closed time Now so miss Lotte
5701,3,To be honest me and my family just roamed around and didnt get to ride anything because of the long queues and we went on a weekday There was an indoor park for children and the outdoor which we didnt get to enjoy because of weather and most rides were closed at that time The place is clean and food was expensive as expected from any amusement park Do we plan to return No But my younger sister wants to The indoor ice skating rink was nice though
5702,3,The location of Lotte world is quite convenient however the time i choose for visiting there maybe is not good people is too crowded every facility needs inline waiting over one hour No matter what there is a huge and beautiful place Also very convenient to connect to the Lotte mall Still is a good experience at there
5703,5,Visited Lotte world with my 11 year old pre teen Booked tickets on KLOOK  got the one with 5 premium magic passes each Did not regret it one bit These magic passes are used like the Disneyland fast passes simply present the passes indicated on the ticket and struck off once used for a ride  enter a separate queue for magic pass and board the ride It was challenging trying to obtain magic passes using the app  the entrance ticket itself includes 3 magic passes  but these are subject to availability We did not bother obtaining any after failing in the first hour  To avoid the crowd we purposely visited on a Monday Got in at 930 once the park opened Finished the thrill rides by 1130 with merely 510 min queues each By noon the lines were snaking around But it didnt look too bad  wait time was 1530 min max We opted to use our premium magic passes for repeat rides which my daughter really enjoyed The park was most crowded from mid afternoon onwards Our favorites were the Atlantis and gyro swing We are adrenaline junkies Unfortunately the gyro drop and French Revolution were closed for maintenance  For the price paid it was a fun day out Very value for money Do not forget to explore the underland  these were the bulk of the VR rides so avoid if prone to get motion sickness or giddy  Food was decently priced not exorbitant for a theme park A large drink and popcorn chicken went for 6000won Please do yourself a favor and rent a locker  1000won only  per use  cant open repeatedly
5704,3,This was part of my tour visit to Lotte world  theres a indoor and outdoor theme park  shopping mall  we spend around 23 hours here  The theme park have been operating for some years now  Its a big run down
5705,4,The park has both indoor and outdoor areas Most of the ride inside are for kids We went out for a while but it rained not long after so we werent able to explore  We did enjoy their magic show  The food inside the park are affordable and the taste of the ones we ordered were okay We tried 3 restaurants lunch afternoon snack and early dinner
5706,5,Great for the whole family Its great to visit during winter because the whole area is enclosed so it is warm inside Its have every activity for every age group They even have a Folk Museum that every one should visit to feel History
5707,2,If youre planning to go to Lotte World i suggest you not unless youre going for the kids ride only This place is suuuuper crowded even on a Monday So crowded and most rides would cost you minimum 1 hour to 2 hours max waiting in queue  I went there around 10am and i was only able to play 1 ride and that 1 ride had me waited 2 hours in queue Yes it was a fun ride but will i go for another ride and wait for hours Hell no  And the Magic Pass app is a useless app cant reserve any rides at all Wasted my hald day there
5708,4,Lotte world is an indoor and outdoor theme park perfect for winter time Before we went here we already put in our mind this theme park was not Disneyland so we didnt expect it to be like Disneyland We bought out tickets from Klook When we bought Klook offered the cheapest price around 27000 krw than any other online ticket We redeemed our tickets in south gate entered the room for group ticketing to redeem the voucher  When we were there it was very cold and all of outdoor rides didnt operated It made indoor rides had a long queued But for kiddies rides the queue was not long enough As for food we preferred to eat at Lottys Garden because of its varieties and price  Rather than the rides we loved the parades most Since the parade area was not big enough almost all children could dance with the characters  Lotte world provides locker rental for coat but we suggest you to bring it along with you just like local people
5709,4,Had a fun afternoonevening with friends  A few tips  Tickets are normally 55000 won but you can get discounted tickets on Klook for 28000 won with the option to get the Magic Pass x 3 or 5 for an additional 22000  34000 won  which I would highly recommend  If you do buy tickets on Klook you enter via the South gate  The Magic Pass lets you skip the queue which most of the main rides had a wait time of 15  2 hours  Dont download the app to try and reserve a spot on the ride to skipqueue thing and dont try and use the Magic pass Kiosk  the app kept crash and only let you book in 15 minute slots which filled up pretty quickly and the same with the kiosks   The rides for the magic pass would say close but when we walked up to try and use our ticket the attendant will mark off your ticket let you straight though  winner after mucking around with the app and kiosk for quite some time
5710,3,As a foreigner you can get very cheap tickets from Trip Advisor Klook etc We got some from Govoyagin for 28000 The problem we found was that it didnt include the three Magic Passes which enables you to skip the queue using either an app or the vending machine outside the ride Going on Lunar New Year Eve it was particularly crowded and most of our time was spent in queues There was even a hot air balloon ride inside much like a Ferris wheel really which had a queue of 100 mins In sum it was interesting cute had some cool VR rides did the three Wild ones but it was an exhausting day PS Skip the haunted mansion Wasnt worth the extra 6000 won
5711,4,If you want to see and indooe park this is really cute If ypu have children they will love to go to this place Have a really beutiful parade at night during the cold weather Have a reallu cute park for toddlers and they have theynown rides in really cute I did it at night because i want to take some pictures but not to ride in any attractions It have an out door island that have rides for adults a lot of really great food It has restaurants too Theprice of the entres depends of what time you go too If you go really late at night is cheaper but you have a of less time in it
5712,4,Enjoyable place to have nice time especially if with kids Many interesting attractions are available Easily accessible Better to enter early in the morning and buy full day ticket In such case you will not need to make additional payments for most attractions and wait less in queues
5713,3,The place is very nice to travel with the familyWe went there is weekend and it was very crowded Next time we are thing to ho in week days
5714,4,I visited Lotte World as group of friends in January 2018 It was the coldest month in Seoul since the temperature drop to 18 but we managed to enjoy the theme park especially the Magic Island outdoor area The indoor area more focused on childrens and youngers attractions For thrill seeker like us we spent the whole day in outdoor area The good things about Lotte World is the queues is managable and almost all the outdoor games are open even tho its winter We reccomend the gyro drop gyro swing atlantis adventure they excluded the water since its winter and bunge drop for all thrill seeker out there Its worth to try those attraction when you visit Seoul Dont be afraid of the cold because theres a lot heaters in outdoor area If you bought the ticket beforehand through online platform etc you need to exchange the QR code to physical ticket through the South Gate Entrance Theres drinking station in almost all food hall If you want to visit the Lotte World half day you can get a cheaper price by buying the half day ticket but I still reccomend you to visit this park early in the morning or noon and enjoy this park until evening because theres illumination in the castle area
5715,5,Wow That word truly sums up Lotte World An amusement park both indoors and outdoors shopping mall from luxury to daily goods and even a food court that will leave you spoilt for choices It is easily accessible by subway and weather proof for winter time as you will be able to shop in comfort and play in theme park away from extreme conditions if need be Our only complaint is that they made this too easy for us to blow our budgets out of the waters Would recommend at least half a day here if you are planning to shop and experience the park
5716,5,Really this place is totally unexpected Right off a subway station you get a mall amusement park skating rink with a shooting range in the basement Its so many things in one small space and the execution is good When I first heard about it I thought it would be childish or cheap feeling I was so wrong The amusement park is better than some Ive been to in North America What a great place to have a date
5717,4,Lotte world is the fifth tallest building in the world and the third in Asia Ita mall that has many shops franchise restaurants and activities Also you can get you taxe back in the lotte department store 1st floor It a great place for kids they get to discover the lotte world adventure where you have many games and attractions to enjoy with your kids also you have an indoor and outdoor park So if its too cold for you outside yoh can still enjoy the indoor one But if you have a baby like us dont get the ticket entry with games pass get only the ticket for entry to the park
5718,5,The biggest shopping center in Seoul where you will find good restaurant shops and children fin places dont forget to visit the aquarium
5719,3,This place as fun but the inside portion is mostly for children Also there are some rides that are not included pass you would have to pay extra There is a lot to do and see inside There is a food court there and several stands to get snacks The outside portion has some rides but not a lot The lines were extremely long If you go near halloween be prepared for zombies to chase you around
5720,4,Lotte world is a half indoor half outdoor amusement park This is extremely convenient when the temperature goes below 0 Lots of activities are proposed for kids of all ages During weekend and special days it gets easily crowded and lines can become very long
5721,5,Very big entertaining center in Seoul South Korea It was a good trip to spend a whole day in Lotte world
5722,4,This place is huge Filled with anything you name it Shopping cinemas restaurants themepark jogging park lake you name it  But parking is very expensive Still worth a visit
5723,4,You would think you should have access to all the rides in the park after you pay huge bucks for the admission at the door You acrually will have to pay extra to kids rides if you have a toddler The park is very entertaining and lots to do You can definitely spend a whole day here We especially appreciate the huge indoor area during the winter months
5724,5,This is indoor theme park Went with a few friends and the experience is quite nice its a super fun trip and I downloaded a 25 discount coupon from baynaru Theres both an indoor and outdoor amusement park with plenty of rides for all ages countless shops restaurants shows and attractions Theres even an indoor ice rink a bowling alley and shooting range which are quite popular as well
5725,4,Love the rides  atmosphere travel back to dreamland  thrilling rides Nice food court to have dinner  watch the parade
5726,3,Do yourself a favour and dont buy the tickets with rides if you do not have atleast 1 full dayThe queues are extremely long and the wait is anywhere from 12 hours for each ride They do have a general admission ticket which only lets you see inside but no ride They have both an indoor and outdoor areaIndoor area rides are mostly for kids and outdoor area for adultsWell worth a visit though You can take the subway to reach
5727,4,the largest indoor playground in asia with various types of games that are indoor or outdoor providing a variety of food games and attractions as well as exciting performances to follow very long queue open until 2200
5728,5,If you like amusement parks or want to give your kids a treat and live in Seoul or stay there for many days I can recommend it as a daytrip Its fun  some attractions have a hight restriction Go there with subway if you can as this is very convenient
5729,3,Outdoor rides were all closed Thus the queue for the indoor rides were crazily long  I would go again in spring or summer probably
5730,2,went there during christmas holiday week not sure if its due to the cold weather or if its just the place itself maybe its just us a few rides were closed those that are open had long lines lotte world is more of a place to take nice photos because really its a pretty place the parade looks fun to watch pretty much thats it the indoor area seems more fun than the outdoor area the outdoor area is basically just a disneywannabe castle with some rides surrounding it when we went there only 2 rides were open so we felt like we wasted our time there  maybe its more fun to visit during warmer season oh beware of local teens they have this habit of running around to reach different rides in big groups and theyre unapologetic if they hit you or your child while running  btw note for muslim travelers prayer rooms are provided at level 3 its somewhere behind the cartoon network shop however theres no halal restaurant or eatery Iron Bull isnt halal Pasha has closed now replaced by Auntie Annes even though a Pasha signage nearby still exists maybe the closure is a very recent event since no reentry is permitted the hungry us had to settle for some fries at nearby Deli Bon
5731,4,Do your homework Like how to use the fast pass where are the machines to make the reservations or download the apps ahead of time Otherwise you will waste a lot of time forming line We went from 11am3pm I would actually recommend going earlier to avoid the crowd
5732,4,Ive been to this place with my family My children really enjoy it The fly Adventure made them feel very exited Other game like roller coaster and skate are very good The food is nice and many choices Really had fun there
5733,1,I did see some negative reviews before visiting and I have to agree with the ones about being over crowded Dont be surprised to wait 25 hrs for rides We spent 200 aud on entry and sat on one kids ride
5734,3,Traffic took almost 3 hours from Junggu and the lines for rides inside Lotte World were more than 60 minutes Navigation for our senior family member was not smooth sailing as the elevator was always full and only stsirs from basement to ground The place has a lot to offer but the shouldertoshoulder guests made it difficult to enjoy during December holidays
5735,4,We visited for the second time as our last visit was 8 years ago when the kids were still small and we wanted to experience the Christmas parade to get into the christmas mood As we are not the adventurous sort we made Lotte World our last stop for the day and bought the after 7pm ticket Everything was almost the same as before but we still enjoyed ourselves However I would only pay for the full day ticket if I intended to get on the rides Nice to go for a looksee to experience some theme park magic
5736,5,Couldnt have planned for a better day in the midst of cold February Kids were happy and smiled all day Its super easy to find with public transport caters for kids especially younger ones There is god stalls everywhere and its next to the aquarium and shopping centre which can help round off the whole day
5737,1,Too Long queueing  not worthy for couple One day pass not worth it During winters out door park are closed
5738,3,Lotte Adventure World is a haven for parents with kids 12 and below as everything there is made for the little ones It is a onestopshop and playground for parents who dont hv to fret about children being bored However the queue to every ride takes about 6070minutes For those with toddlers the queues are shorter in the section for tiny tots The services offered to parents are ample It is a brightlylit place with lots of colour but for teens n adults the surging crowds and noise level there can grate on your nerves
5739,1,Went there with my family of 4 and most of the outdoor rides were closed because of winter time and a lot of indoor rides were under inspection hence closed They didnt even tell the patrons when we bought the tickets The rest of the rides were either too kiddy even for my 6 years old or the queue was like 2 hours We ended up spending only 2 hours there and took 1 ride which is the merry goround Totally a bad experience Cannot go during winter time This place is also meant for toddlers Far far from disney standard
5740,4,Very nice place to be with children However the queue is very long for the popular rides and I think will be more worth if purchase the magicpass
5741,4,Visited with family with 2 children during very cold winter of Seoul Its very good as there are indoor and outdoor theme park Indoor theme park is perfectly well during the winter time especially when the temperature outside is minus degrees The theme park is not very big actually but its good enough for you to spend whole day there Its easily accessible via Jamsil Subway and linked directly with the subway station Plenty of shops and restaurants located at the same places If youre not a locals you could get good discount by buying the ticket from 3rd party website which enable you to enjoy discount of more than 40 for the admission fee We paid only USD30 pax for the ticket while buying on site the ticket price for adult is KRW55000adult and KRW45000child for a day pass Worth the visit if you visit Seoul with family  children
5742,4,It was winter when we visited and the indoor theme park is a haven of children and parents Its warm and welcoming and a lot of fun Also the fact that full house taped a few moment of their episode here is a bonus
5743,1,Small crowded and long queue Expensive and not worth visiting Cheaper  better to visit HK Disneyland
5744,2,Visited on a day that was pouring with rain with the hopes that the worlds apparently largest indoor themepark would have something to offer Even for a Monday the place was packed To make it worse the outdoor attractions shut down in the rain making indoors even more crowded There were threehour queues snaking around the park If youre used to the likes of Universal Studios I would say to give Lotte World a miss if youre only in Seoul for a week
5745,3,Wasnt a very good experience as I came in winter Most of the rides were closed so the remaining rides that are opened had very long queues I took a total of 2 rides in the entire afternoon with a one and half hour queue time each  However what Ive observed is that itll be a great place for kids in winter Lots of kiddy rides thats indoor away from the harsh winter air  Will recommend coming in other seasons
5746,5,After we prebooked our tickets our I worried myself a bit after reading some poor reviews but we had lots of fun Lots of teenschildren but we are both in our late 20s and still had a great day Dont spend money on the mini zoo the animals are so poorly looked after and be aware that some things will cost extra We arrived early on a wet overcast day which seemed to help as we had little to no wait time on most rides As the day went on we could see wait times were massively increasing so would strongly recommend going early Check out the folk museum and dont forget to get a park map as many rides are upstairs downstairs or outside
5747,5,Lotte World has both an indoor and outdoor theme park and because its within the city expect huge crowds at the various rides Be prepared to spend up to 2 hours waiting in line for your turn on the more popular ie thrilling rides Lots of food options available but I didnt spend much time on that Lunch and dinner was a sandwich and I ate whilst queuing The Comet Express outdoor and the French Revolution indoor rollercoasters will send your head spinning which is what I came for and got it
5748,5,We are 5 pax bought our tickets from Klook RM100 per pax There is an indoor and an outdoor theme park The outdoor has more thrilling rides and the indoor has more kiddy rides The have the largest indoor theme park in the world The indoor theme park has multiple levels Be ready to spend a whole fun day there
5749,5,Getting to Lotte World is really easy by Subway Do take note that if you have purchased your tickets through 3rd party vendors like Klook you will need to change to a physical ticket at South Gate  The indoor amusement park has a few floors It has a roller coaster which is quite thrilling There are lots of rides for all ages but I felt indoors are mostly catered to the younger children  The outdoor theme park is equally fun with roller coasters and many other rides  Rides are free but you need to pay for games  Food are not too expensive within the premises  Do take note that reentry is not allowed
5750,5,The rides are awesome here and all the decors are really fancy Avoid visiting on weekends since there will be longer lines for the rides Restaurants are slightly overpriced but has good quality You can also bring your lunchbox in theres a separate terraceeating place Check on their website before visiting they offer lots of benefits and coupons
5751,4,We went on a weekday which happen to fall on a day when many of the schools brought their kids so the lines were a bit long for the bigger rides There are a variety of different roller coasters crazy spin you upside down rides just cruising slow paced rides 3D attractions A HAUNTED HOUSE really liked this one and lots of fun rides for the kids They also had a parade at night which was pretty interesting This place is pretty big so I would suggest making good use of the map and pick the places you would like to try and check out I would also recommend checking different sites for tickets on sale I went with my sisters  friends and what made this place fun was being able to hang out with friends enjoy different attractions together The customer service was pretty good and friendly for the most part Kids would have fun for sure but going with friends as adults is fun as well
5752,4,Its one of the most interesting amusement parks of S Korea and conveniently accessible as far as its located inside the city However it is really overcrowded In order to enjoy your time there and to avoid wasting the most of your time waiting on long ques try to avoid if possible weekends and holidays On the other hand using the fastpass can save some waiting time but its availability is very restricted
5753,2,if your kid is 5 or less stay inside There are things to do on the 1st floor besides the Carousel We didnt find this area until later so we wasted time outside Outside rides are for older kids except for 2 rides which were boringshort The boat ride was fun but its too cold in oct to winter I think if I had to do it again I would skip this if you have a toddler and go elsewhere
5754,1,Such a disappointing park If everland is a stripped down version of disneyland this is a stripped down version of everland in a shopping mall  If you have to choose between everland and lotte world dont choose here
5755,4,Very large shopping mall You wikl find all you need over there Especially all the famous international brands
5756,5,This park is so much fun My friend and I went for the day were both in our 30s and we had a blast The rides are a lot of fun I was so impressed that a lot of the rides are indoors Its a mustsee for any age
5757,4,The big draw for this place in Korea is that it is partially indoors There is a very expensive shooting range here too The lines for the rides are usually really long
5758,3,It was a fun place When you have extra time you can go there It is not as spectacular as Universal Studios or Disneyland but it could do Nothing much to say They have indoor and outdoor area a few rides Thats it
5759,5,It may be packed loud the ticket may be a bit expensive but this is fun Great place to get loose and just relax and ride the gyro and all other crazy trains machines boats Feel like a kid again go there to have a great time and just take it easy and have a great day
5760,4,I went during the summer when school was off so there was quite a lot of people But the best thing was the magic passes Even though some of the lines were long by planning ahead I was able to rid on quite a number of attractions before the end of the day One downside was the hot weather So be careful if you go during the summer
5761,1,I understand there are queues on theme parks but I have never seen anything like these 2 hour queues Managed to get to 3 rides but none are the popular ones mainly outdoor where is was sun baking us it was extremely crowded when we went and staff were not helpful trying to manage the population
5762,4,We went on a Friday to my surprise it was packed with school teenagers we literally had to q up more than 15 hours for each ride Only managed to get on 4 rides the day My kid at age 8 was able to play on the roller coaster but however the q was a waiting time of 25 hours We gave up on it we finally ended up playing on the kiddies ride in the indoor area Which there was not much people But not much of an excitement for my boy Overall we had fun But very tired legs too
5763,5,We brought 2 kids age 4 and 6 to Lotte World theme park and they had whale of a time Although my younger girl cant take most rides shorter than 110cm she thoroughly enjoy the 230pm and 830pm parade and the magic show at Fairy Theatre  We were there 1130am  9pm and honestly only manage to cover the whole indoor adventure park but for outdoor barely cover 20 Will highly recommend families to stay whole day If you wish to visit the Lotte Aquarium or Pororo Park please arrange separately as the 1 Day pass for your to enter Lotte World theme park when you exit cannot reenter  I had gone to Pororo Park on 2 other days; 2 hours this is the limit for the ticket entry price on each day The small playground with slide rooms with Lego blocks and building blocks Pororo  Friends performance the big bouncing castle carousel only open for small intervals on weekday ferries Wheel and bumper car are all really fun for both my kids Although it is more crowded on weekend the rides are all more frequent hence dont really need to queue much Personally think my kids had more fun on weekend as they manage to catch more rides during the 2 hours compared to a weekday And parents with preschoolers trust me although it is only 2 hours it is enough to exhaust them that the kids will sleep early that day
5764,1,for those that like a disney type of experience this is not the place its marketed that way but its defiantly not not to mention it is stuffy and really overheated the staff really arent helpful so if you ask if a ride is roller coaster type or 34D they cant answer the question then the realisation that you have spent 100 to get into a not so fun place hits  i went on a couple of rides and they were very bad quality there is no escapism andthe staff are not professional by any means
5765,3,Most of the popular rides waiting time is at least 3040mins and we went there on a Wednesday There is an outdoor and indoor theme park similar to Genting Highlands theme park Do take note that admission tickets are for single admission only once you exit the theme park reentry is not allowed We bought the one day pass via Changi Recommend website which is significantly cheaper as compared to the original price
5766,5,Variety of play areas for kids and adults we visited the place almost near the Halloween so they prepare the place for the celebration with great zombies walk in the night Worth visiting for sure
5767,1,Even though you have premium pass and almost reach on time you can feel stubborn and arrogant service from young crews
5768,5,This place is a peace of heaven  the view is good  its safe  the building itself contains a big shopping center  its so close to so many places and the heart of seuol
5769,4,The downside was just it was overcrowded Maybe its just because we went at a busy day Overall its all good
5770,4,We only spent few hours in there in the evening maybe it was because the Halloween theme plus national holiday Lotte world was over crowded However it is a magnificent place and really good fun for children Worth visiting for sure
5771,4,Went to this place on a holiday expecting it to be somewhat slow It was busy Many good rides but the cues for the roller coasters were too long The rides I do ride were very fun and had an almost Disney level of quality to the attractions The food was also very good I ate way too much My only disappointment was TGIFridays on the 1st floor ground floor
5772,4,There are many rides that are better than expected and several that are just terrible This is a very unique amusement park design and feels huge inside Highlights include the Atlantis roller coaster outside Pharaohs Furry the night Lets Dream parade and the free Korea cultural museum
5773,4,We didnt go inside the Lotte World Anyway there is a beautiful lake walk around You can admire the worlds 5 highest building from different angles and even go into the top at extra cost
5774,5,Good for enjoy with friends and family cupuls too much funnyso many adventure games hear excellent 
5775,2,Lotte World Adventure was advised as an amusement park that one should not miss when visiting Seoul After having paid KRW 26k for the one day pass  50 less then the advertised rate thanks to Thanksgiving  it felt more like going back in time  its mainly an indoor amusement park build on 3 floors around an ice skating ring The place looks old but certainly was great in the 70s Wanna ice skate  pay extra To make the place a little more contemporary  we are in high tech Korea right   a VR room and a Wild Jungle VR ride was added The VR ride was not really state of the art but well done and certainly one of the rides to do The Sindbad boat Ride was OK but not recommended for kids Looking for food dont be confused Several restaurants have a in and an outside Once you pass through the restaurant to the outside into the mall you actually left the Adventure Park and reentry is not allowed
5776,4,Lotte world as a themepark was great My friends and I went to both Lotte world and Everland and although Lotte world looks more kiddish in appearance the rides here are actually more thrilling than the ones at Everland only the T express is thrilling there but requires an almost 2h long wait The pirate ship ride here was faster and went up higher There is both an indoor and outdoor portion and you can easily spend a few hours here I also highly recommend the Flume ride Gyro Swing and the Atlantis However some rides were unfortunately unavailable due to the weather but you can download the app to check when they open  It is also connected to the lotte department store and the food section as well  where you can get local snacks
5777,3,Bring the children here n they will love it All the cute things in the park is so colorful Nice for picture
5778,5,Visited with my daughters on 24th September a Sunday We make good use of the 20 coupon at the back of Seoul Map available to tourist upon arrival at Incheon Airport Outdoor rides are limited compared to Indoor rides Please try to avoid weekends and holidays for the long long queue that takes 23hrs just for a ride which is really frustrating Overall it is a very good amusement park to spend a day exploring with the family which we enjoyed and will definitely look forward to returning again on a week day
5779,4,Very popular with local people Connected with Lotte hotel and shopping complex Can easily spend a day in this area
5780,5,The park is very close to train stations  bus stops Weve stayed at Lotte World Hotel which made our visit more convenient They have lots of familyoriented attractions although during our visit the hot air balloon ride was not operational but nonetheless very fun  amazing visit  Thanks Cris Yigo Guam USA
5781,5,Not as big scale as compared to everland but filled with a lot of fun activities The queue was quite terrible when I went there on a monday Located in the city and thus very accessible for tourists planning to travel seoul only Bonus lotte mart and departmental store are just right outside and you may want to buy things there after spending a day in lotte world
5782,5,My 7 years old daughter loved the place so much especially the pororo house Lotte world is a very good place not only for children but adults as well you have so many things to do inside Its worth the money spent Well definitely visit again next time
5783,3,I read so many good reviews about this place so I had big expectations Well it didnt meet them Dont get me wrong park is nice and have some good rides but nothing impressive There is for sure better adventure parks like Six Flags or Disney World Food inside is very cheap so thats good As a tip go after 4pm because they have a special rate and also rides are less busier Park closes at 11pm so you will have enough time to do some rides
5784,5,A lot of rides for the children There is an indoor park and an outdoor park The outdoor park looks fun with exciting rides but we didnt manage to take rides as it was raining  However there was plenty to do indoors The rides are based according to heights We went during off peak so the queues were not too long There is also an evening  It is easy to go there using public transport just that you need to walk to bit from the subway to the Lotte World
5785,3,We made the mistake of only buying the general admission ticket as we didnt think it was worth buying the all inclusive ticket with a 2 year old we ended up paying heaps more as the one area we went into  Kids Zone we had to pay for both of us plus him to enter which was only for 45 minutes before we had to exit out Really disappointing also didnt help that the staff didnt speak a great deal of English so when we did ask about the tickets they had said that it would cost nothing for our 2 year old and what we understood as we could go on 4 rides for free was actually he could go on those 4 rides for free if we buy the all inclusive ticket Getting between the different levels is also very confusing the lifts dont all go up and down to all levels only certain levels so we walked around in circles for ages trying to work out how to get to different areas
5786,3,Lotte World is a major recreation complex in SeoulThe great thing about this theme park it is covered we enjoyed in lotte park espically my daughter TammyThe bad thing about it 1It is crowded and you wait long time to play 2It is expensive if you compare the price with Tokyo Disney or Everland 3There are extra fee for some rides 4It is small and you can go to all rides and games in less than three hours  One of the best thing in this place is show every hour they have show and enjoyed the music and danceIf you have kids you should go
5787,5,No need to explain Kids and Theme parks A day is not enough to explore and enjoy Go there early and spend the whole day to get the maximum out of your ticket
5788,3,We are not huge Disneyland people but this was a fun adventure More of a kid and teen activity but ok for adults Pretty pricey about 30USperson but if youre into rides and games its fun especially at night They even have an Electric Light Parade just like Disney
5789,4,I reserved a whole day for Lotte World and spent a fun day here with my friends There were both indoors and outdoors for the theme park so you will be able to enjoy the rides even it is raining There are more activities suitable for children indoors compared to outdoors as there are mainly rides for the outdoor part It wasnt too expensive to have food inside I recommend you to come here if you have a spare day in Seoul
5790,4,2 days at Lotte World were just enough to do it all  and with a 4 year old we left a lot of the adults rides in the outdoor park  7 levels of entertainment indoors good rides and effects  lots to do  good options for food and drink and something for all the ages  Recommended 
5791,5,We booked a ticket on the internet and saved a good amount The theme park is absolutely amazing Rides are a combination of adrenaline and smooth The overall park is a Disney style theme a must for families  I didnt think the park looked old at all Very well organised and definitely value for money You will have a very good time This is coming from someone who has three world class theme parks in their city
5792,1,We visited the Lotte World amusement park expecting a Disneylike experience The park is expensive and underwhelming
5793,4,So heres the facts you need to consider  Best to go during the week whereby you can purchase tickets at a lower cost Next Arrive as close to opening time as you can to ensure short lines If not happy about long lines purchase a Magic Pass a fair bit more expensive that takes you to the front of the queue Note that once queues build up substantially  which they do  many of the rides close the expensive Magic Pass In other words get there the earlier the better Weekends are terribly busy meaning long lines  Lotte World truly caters for all ages not necessarily those over 65 who Lotte World believe are too old to go on some of the rides with a myriad of toddler child and adult rides  Now to what really upsets me Youd think that the entry fee would cover everything aside from food etc of course Well it doesnt Indeed there are many areas requiring you to spend extra Take the Ice Rink for example; it is completely autonomous to the adventure park even though it is right in the middle of it  You can have a great day at Lotte It really comes down to what you make of it
5794,4,Our teenage doughters loved Lotte World A large part is indoor so very good for rainy days During summer and weekends its very busy so you might avoid those times
5795,3,It is a littleold BUT we went during the week and the wait times were barely anything Not a whole lot for our 4 year old She was even too short for some of the kid rides Go figure Not a bad day
5796,3,I didnt love it I felt like I had traveled through a time machine back to the early 90s The place was a bit outdated However  my kids loved it AND it really wasnt as crowded as it could have been Im guessing everyone now goes to Everland
5797,4,Checked out Lotte World the mall theme park and building The mall was a mall no surprise there Some upscale stores as well as the usual mall type stores Decent food court The view at the top of Lotte World Tower was really nice and not too expensive Glass floors make it funinteresting The theme park has a little for everyone Food rides and plenty of entertainment Definitely worth a visit if you are there for a weekend
5798,5,During our three day stay in Seoul we made one full day visit to Lotte World It is total fun park with many attractions 3D movie theaters and different choices to eat It is a busy place so I recommended coming early or buy the magic pass It is normal to wait for more than 15 minutes 
5799,4,If you like amusement park this place can be a good option Ive been here three times On the weekend it is super busy Lines will be so long The longest time I waited in the line was 2 hours
5800,4,Nice view from top of the tower Multiple option of restaurant at the top There is observation deck on chargeable basis to enjoy the view or choose to eat out at any eating place to have a good view
5801,5,Super big theme park both indoors and outdoors Indoor games closes till 10pm Have a few scary rides indoors especially the French revolution where the queue was as long as 90mins at around 6pm  Please purchase tix from funtastickorea funko for short Costs 29000Krw I think cant remember but it was 45 discount Pay online and they will email you the tickets which you show to the counter to exchange for actual tickets  We went on a Saturday so it was filled with locals Managed to try almost all the games but we left the place at 11pm We started at 11am though
5802,5,This place is suitable and sufficient for a days worth of fun for kids and even adults accompanying kids Directly connected to Jamsil Station Seoul Subway Line 2 8 Exit 4 it is definitely a convenient place to get to with kids around
5803,4,Very nice theme park had fun riding their amazing rides they have restaurants inside too kids and adults will love it here
5804,5,Spent my birthday this year here with my husband and two young boys and it ended up being such a fun day The boys were excited from the moment we entered It was indoors so it was perfect during the rainy weather We went on a Friday and there were not that many people so the lines for the rides were not bad at all I cant imagine how the lines would be on a weekend Everything was cute and catered for kids There were adult rides as well but we didnt go on them There are lots of places to get food and we ended up eating at their fancy Italian restaurant for lunch to celebrate The food was delicious and price was not too bad At the top floor they have this area like the Alive Museum which was fun for everyone The place was not too big so it wasnt overwhelming like Disneyland or Disneyworld I thought it was just the right size for a one day visit We got combo tickets for the Lotte World and the Lotte Aquarium from Klook which was a great deal
5805,4,We took the train to Jamsil station and walked to Lotte World We went on a weekday so not so crowded I bought the tickets online so its cheaper but still need to go to the counter to exchange for the tickets Indoor is more for younger children while outdoor is more for the adults as the rides are more thrilling Its quite fun think most children will like it
5806,5,Lots to do Massive shopping center Loads of restaurants and cafes Lots of shops too Very entertaining  get ready to walk loads
5807,5,We just came to window shop and my wife checked all the designers store All the beauty products under the sun is here plus more Duty free shopping is also available here very convenient for foreigners to shop The food section is unbelievable anything you want is available both local and imported items The quality and availability of food items in this market surpassed the US supermarkets
5808,5,I went with family a week ago I visited many theme parks in the world including Disney world Lotte world is a way and much much better than any theme park It is like a dream land to kids If you are going to Seoul never ever miss this place
5809,4,My son loved both the indoor and outdoor park Its a very compact place but managed to fit in quite a lot
5810,2,This place have everything Every type of rides you can find at Disneyuniversal studios you can find it hereBut a Ripoff version of everything Do not set your expectation too high and you will not be disappointed The place is well maintained and food options are aplenty
5811,5,My friends visited with their 2 children age 5 and 7 I was ecstatic when I saw their faces light up with joy as we entered this fantasy world of fun  There was a parade when we arrived and I was surprised at the outfits I felt like I should have had dollar bills in my hand  making it rain The dads and guys seemed to like it  The Sinbad ride was exciting and the hot air balloon ride was worth the wait  Everything was worth seeing the kids faces They ran from ride to ride in sheer bliss  Arcade ice skating rides food beer  rides for toddlers and babies and some rides parents can join which makes great for photos  Might get wet outside in the summer  Get a discount or dont go  Friendly staff and very safe atmosphere  You could spend the whole day here tire the kids out and then get a bite to eat and do some shopping A family business trip could be spent here at the hotel and all day at Lotte World  This building has smoking rooms on specific floors
5812,4,Dont expect a Disneyland kind of experience but with the right mindset this can be a fun place Dont pay full price there a discount coupons all over Seoul and if you visit after 4pm you pay a reduced price combined with a discount coupon the entrance fee is reduced by almost 50 The place is open till 10pm so you have lots of time to explore Most of the rides is standard carnival stuff but they also have a couple of rides which are brave attempts to copy Disney They do not succeed but it is all very charming and we laughed about it Staff is for the most part friendly Stay till 8pm for the excellent light parade
5813,4,i visited on a weekday and it wasnt very crowded The wait was around 5 to 15min only The theme park looks a bit run down Staff are enthusiastic and friendly My younger kids enjoyed themselves very much Grandparents spent their time at the lotte mart and adjoining shopping mall Do note that you are not allowed to reenter after leaving the gantry Hence you have to take your meals within the themepark Lots of choices though
5814,3,For the price it was what I expected I was disappointed they only sold beer at one restaurant and lines were insanely long More of a place for kids and families not adults who wanna drink and ride rides
5815,3,The day i was there it was raining so Only half of the attractions were open  Inside is pretty filled to the brim with rides but its mostly for little kids Id say middle school at the oldest Lot of 4Dish rides  For the price you could do worse
5816,3,For a midlifer I found this place as just okay Just to while your time Good thing we went here at around 7pm where the entrance fee is much cheaper If you have been to Disneyland Universal Studios and Ocean Park and you just want to visit and not take the rides then go at 7pm
5817,3,1 hour from central this indoor  outdoor park is big with many rides whether you visit in weekend or weekdays it is extremely over crowded with locals you have to wait 3060 minutes for most of the rides we have spent 56 hours and hardly enjoyed 78 rides we have spent whole day standing from one queue to another You have to pay money for many rides and many rides are boring and mostly for kids so not worth standing in queue for long time few restaurants inside
5818,3,The LOTTE world is located near the department store This is a small theme park and please do not expect too much Some of the game are quite nice but I think its rather old We are here for only 2 hours mostly with the VR game But real are so so
5819,5,We started early morning so we had the chance to enter each game twice its amazing on weekdays so you can avoid the crowd many restaurants amazing hourly parades fare prices we finished by 9 pm my kids fell asleep without bedtime arguments its a must on every Seoul visit
5820,3,Theme park is more suitable for children may be up to 11 years old and the facility inside looks pretty old
5821,5,Lotte World is really famous place in Korea Also it is nice place to come with kids Every kids would like Lotte World because there are many costumes and there are a lots of rides The best thing was when you pay with MasterCard we can get a 25 discount
5822,3,Good attraction to visit Many games and rides available for different rages for ages Easy to reach by metro or taxi or buss  Verity of Resturants around   Recommend place to visit 
5823,5,Its our second time visiting the park There are much more people then before prepare to queue up for some of the popular rides Quite a lot of rides are closed for maintenance when we visited which is quite frustrating The indoor part is amazing and very good for our visit as there was lots of rain Occasionally there are singers performance at the indoor stage Overall a not bad choice for families to spend half day or so
5824,5,This is a huge and very complicated place make sure you get a map before you got in or else you will waste your time to search for places There is indoor and outdoor activity it is very fun place and I suggest you to go there after 4PM because it is cheaper I made a video on my trip to seoul come and check it out and see how the theme park looks like  search by title  6 TRAVEL BLOG DAY 5 SEOUL  CULTURAL DAY
5825,2,Not all that One of those places you that are cool for an hour The vendor prices are good The place tends to be overcrowded and not well managed at times Do not pay full price Find a deal online Been twice and both times multiple rides were closed
5826,4,We visited with children that are 12 10 and 8 years old There are some fun roller coasters for them all We were there from about 1030 until 10pm and were able to ride almost everything and rode our favorite rides twice We chose this park over Everland because it is so convenient to Seoul We bought out tickets through Funtastic Korea and got a great discount Make sure you buy the 1day pass if you want to ride the rides because the General Admission tickets just get you in the park Dont lose you tickets either because you have to show them as you enter each ride
5827,4,Loved the rides at Lotte World My friends and I went on a Saturday and some queues for rides were rather long French Revolution had a waiting time of 60mins For daredevils please do try out the Gyro Drop It may seem intimidating I was regretting while waiting for the ride to start but it was a superb unforgettable experience And best of all there wasnt a queue  Best part about lotte world is the indoor park where you can take shelter in when the weather is too warm or it starts to rain
5828,4,I went here as part of my college university in Seoul so I cant tell you much about ticketing since it was free for me HOWEVER I can tell you what to expect inside After handing your ticket to the people in the front they will return it MAKE SURE YOU KEEP IT ON YOU BECAUSE SOME RIDES WILL ASK FOR PROOF OF PURCHASE If you go in the morning I highly suggest hitting the outside rides first just because its still cool outside and the lines will be relatively short For those that have a waist line bigger than 32 inches some rides might not be good for you just based on the fact that in Asia many things including roller coasters are built for smaller people I am a larger woman and i was able to ride the bumper cars the spin guro the hot air balloons the carasole and there were a few others that I opted out of that would be accommodating to larger people Bring your own food While there is food in the amusement park and it is relatively cheap in comparison to parks in the US it is still just amusement food I ate at school food which has some good kimbap and ddeokbokki If you have younger ones or if youre not good with big crowds then definitely avoid the weekends where it gets pretty packed and the lines get lengthy it was an hour for the hot air balloons All in all it was fun but it is packed Definitely a tourist spot and workers are decent with English 
5829,3,Dont expect the international service here if you used to visit Disneyland or universal studio or intentional theme park else where This is the lower standard than you expect Staffs is not friendly They are dead like they are forcing to work here 1 out of 10 scores for the service mind 2 out of 10 scores for the helpful service And staff here dont speak English And they ignore you sometime with the dead face  Some of the rides look interesting but you have to pay more for example VR zone
5830,5,Lottemart Seoul where I go is in the Seoul station Just go insideupstairs and turn right You can see huge lottemart with lots of goods thereyou can try many tester therefoodfruit snacks etc
5831,3,The place are run down and the rides are old as compared to the other countries Some of the rides are closed too
5832,5,great experience in Lotte World Adventure and Aquarium one of the most memorable trip of my life 
5833,5,I am 7 years old and it was a fun time there And I get to go on every rollercoaster except the one outside I was too small for it Vr rollercoaster was the best The queues were very very Long but not as Long as some places like universal studios in Singapore The indoor part was the best coz it was cool not hot and we went early so going on rides was easy The tomb of horror was horrible I was so scared my daddy had to carry me just like a little baby Now Im done
5834,4,on the weekend or national holiday will be so crowd some popular ride air balloon need a very long waiting time but overall I am satisfied for Muslim they provide prayer room it is clean and well arranged
5835,3,People warned us that Lotte world would be crowded but the Tuesday afternoon in June we decided to go was not at all bad As an amusement park I believe it fits families with younger children best under 10 However it is still worth a visit even with older kids The outdoor area was more crowded with longer lines
5836,5,We went with 3 kids aged 17 Although we arrived only after 1pm there was still sufficient time to complete most of the rides Do note that there is a minimum height requirement of 110cm for most kid rides Both my elder kids enjoyed themselves a lot What was great was 34 of the rides were indoors
5837,4,I often bring my friends to this place If youve never visited this place it is worth visit It is very convenient to visit with transportation and lots of attractions to ride Also some VR activities recently added are very interesting If you pay with Mastercard you can have 20 discount on ticket so price is affordable I think  
5838,1,This place is super crowded i went here last february with my friends and we were not able to ride any rides This place is full of kids and locals and i think some has their field trips that day Few rides and a bit old or overused i think they need renovation Well i think this amusement park is for kids for teenanagers better go to Everland 
5839,1,Its old its tired its expensive If ur kids are teenagers go to everland If ur kids are little seoul children grand park amusement park is fantastic
5840,5,What makes Lotte world different from many other theme parks is that it has quite a huge airconditioned what a great plus for summer season indoor theme park section There are many levels of different rides and simply exploring the place makes an interesting experience  I like that rides are of varying thrill levels making it suitable for kids as well as thrillseekers I would definitely recommend it for families even with young children as they have a huge kiddy play section  I went on a weekday and hardly queued for more than 10 min per ride and I took about 14 rides in total Only had to queue 30 min for 1 or 2 rides I was also lucky to find discounted tickets online for foreigners and ended up paying 29000 instead of 52000 won You can google it and purchase them in advance but remember to bring your passport there
5841,3,We went there as 3 families with young children aged from 2 to 8 We had deliberately avoid the weekend and went on a Mon but Lotte world was very crowded My girl aged 8 wanted to try the roller coaster etc but the average waiting time is more than 1 hour Even for the hot air balloon we had to queue for 60 minutes which I feel that it is not worth the wait Most of the time was spent waiting hence it was rather annoying for us  I understand that there is an app which allows us to book the timing in advance but it is not working that well Though it mentioned that the next booking timing but whenever the booking is opened the app will hang and by the time it recovers the booking is closed again  However 1 plus point is that it is air conditioned hence not as hot as other theme parks We did not have enough time to explore the portion outside though we understand there are 2 portions to it  For the younger kids I think they enjoyed the magic show
5842,4,This is one of the famous amusement park in Korea esp in Seoul It has both outdoor and indoor attraction I really enjoyed playing in here even one day was not enough They has full of wifi area everywhere and I needed it so much that time  they offered an application on phone for us so that we dont need to queueing up for long time in every attraction but unfortunately there were some attraction that didnt work when I went there but I want to go there again next time
5843,5,Nice department store and mostly chain with differwnt brands to buy depending on the money you put 
5844,5,My kids really like everything there 5th grader and 2nd grader had a blast They want to go back there for sure
5845,1,Too crowd and long lines but nothing to enjoy  If you want to waste time and money this is the proper place
5846,3,If you have children and are at a loss of ideas on where to go Lotte World would provide your kids with hours of fun From Myeongdong it takes less than an hour to travel to Jamsil station which is directly connected to the park Its a huge place with indoor and outdoor area For those who want to escape from the summer heat will enjoy the fact that there are also many attractions in the indoor area The rides are okay but some of the 3D shorting games was a tad disappointing Avoid weekends and public holidays We went on a weekday morning so it was relatively sane We didnt need to wait long for the rides By afternoon we se hordes of school kids there for their school trip Time to leave It was a fun experience but not so impressive enough for me to want to visit again Then again Im not really into amusement Parks
5847,3,The rides are quite ordinary there is long queues due to tour organiser there is not a whole lot you can do the good point is its indoor so the kids can still have fun in a cool air condition area
5848,2,Shops and stalls all selling the same thing its outrageously tedious and time wasting  improve you life and give it a miss
5849,4,There is a connected mall in the theme park It is an indoor and outdoor park with rides for adults and for kids too Location of this theme park is just around the city which is in Jamsil area
5850,5,Good to shop here cuz there are plenty kinds of food cosmetics accessories and so on Especially very cheap
5851,3,SO this place is super over crowded unless you go over on a weekday then its not so bad I dont suggest going to this place on a weekend since its insane to travel there There are good options of food and restaurants there too but overall its a mediocre theme park meant for little children and big baby adults Its not 6 Flags but it was okay I highly suggest Everland than this place since the rides do get boring and there are English speaking help but going there once is pretty much enough unless you wanna check out the out door park cause thats somewhat fun
5852,3,It is a indoor and outdoor park  with rides food food and a mall It costs around 40 for a pone day pass but for some attraction you will need to pay more It did not make sense since we did choose the all day pass with inclusive of attraction The queue are long about 1h30 We went on a week day non holiday period
5853,5,Is not cheap 27000 wons to get to the last floor but you will have imppressive view over Seoul from 500m above
5854,5,This place  mall  attraction whatever you want to call it is very much with everything that you need to entertain your children below 10yo you can do it here  They have an indoor and an outdoor theme park Get here earlier because the entrance is a bit much if you come in the afternoon They do offer a pass where you can jsmust take alook around Its giod for you just to take pictures  Its connected to the subway so you can visit at anytime summer winter even in rainy days  still comfortable Enjoy your time here
5855,4,This store competes easily with the large high end stores of Europe and the US UK Food stalls and grocery in the basement are alone worth a visit Wonderful designer shops within the store offering stylish high end shopping
5856,5,usually amusement parks in Seoul are outside of the city so this place is great to visit which is easily accessible by public transportation and ever much entertaining
5857,4,Lotte World is your world to amuse with all kinds of fun I was impressed with the ghost house I dont remember the name they made it so real that some of my friends were frozen
5858,2,Im quite disappointed with lotte world If you are two adults thinking where to go between lotte world and everland I think everland would be better  The lines are insane and its very hot inside Im not sure if they have an air conditioning or its an outdoor with roof  but if you really want to go there I suggest that you go after 7pm the ticket prices is much lower and its enough to go around the area and the lines are a bit fast by that time
5859,5,Lotte world is huge I went on a Friday and spent an entire day there Despite it being a weekday the place was super crowded On average I think I spent about 1 and a half hour queuing for each ride The queues can be quite painful but the rides were well worth the queue I would suggest reaching Lotte World the moment it opens and going straight for the few rides you really want to go for first Because the waiting times for some of the more exciting rides become 2 and a half hours later in the afternoon There are many restaurants in the theme park too and they are surprisingly not expensive Also weather is not really an issue since most of the rides are indoors Overall I had a great day there But it was really tiring to queue though
5860,1,If I could give it minus one star I would Wait for rides are massive 140 minutes at 2pm in school time for one of the less popular rides Overpriced overcrowded  left me feeling underwhelmed and under appreciated as a paying customer Would rather have paid best part of 40 pounds for someone to slap me in the face with a wet fish At least cost wise it would have been better value than this complete rip off  Dont bother with the App to reserve rides  doesnt work Hardly a surprise
5861,4,Not as many exillerating rides as many of the outside parks have to offer and we experienced really long lines however it is very much worth a visit and we had a blast A rollercoater ride inside is pretty hair raising Try find foreigner discount days if youre a visitor it can make a big difference price wise
5862,4,The place is impressive we can not argue about it But it is really really crowded Its basically covered with people they are everywhere Long long long lines I have waited for 2 hours for a 7 minuted ride Download application and try not to go crazy
5863,1,I happened to wind up going there on a day when all the schools decided to have their outing on the same day I ended up asking for a refund after about 45 minutes I was told the queue for the roller Coaster outside was 3 hours long Everything else inside looked really long too  The inside section of the park needs some serious updating Didnt go to Everland the week I went as a result of finding out how bogged down with people this place gets  As I left in the late afternoon the queue was much worse There really should be a cap to the number of people they let come into this place  And whatever yo do absolutely avoid any holidays Especially the first week in May
5864,1,Too many people No opportunity No management Evenat least you should wait for 100min to enter the Ghost House Here will be the worst experience of yours
5865,3,Maybe cos we went on Xmas eve too crowded and end up didnt manage to take many rides perhaps only 4 at most Our boys from 7yo to 16yo were disappointed Everland was better
5866,2,If you want to visit a crowded department store to spend thousands of dollars on over priced designer labels go for it I walked through as a curiosity to see what kind of person would pay enormous amounts of money for clothes and accessories made in China but stamped with some designer name I can afford it but would never spend thousands on a purse or shirt
5867,1,I spent more time waiting in line than actually trying the rides I spent two hours just for a 5 minute ride Its really disappointing I enjoyed the VR and the folk museum tho The 50000 won is not worth it
5868,4,Never pay full price for entry tickets if youre a foreigner There are a number of ways to get cheaper entrance tickets and we used Funtastic Korea voucher received 45 discount Despite it saying need 12 days before getting a confirmation email I received this within 10 minutes just ensure bookings are open on the day you want to visit Follow the entry instructions and make sure you take the passport in which the voucher was registered  Lotte World itself is crazy busy at any time Suggest you get there as early as you can Queues can be lengthy Download the Lotte World app to receive three magic passes for quicker entry to your selected rides though wait times can still be more than two hours  The five year old loved his age appropriate rides Yes there is a height restriction and as long as above 110cm then they are allowed on most of the kiddy rides They measure you pretty much at each ride there are a few allowing 90cm
5869,3,Amusement park means you come here to play not to spend time waitingI think administration could use newer technologies to manage visitors Id prefer go to openair Ocean or Everland parks but theyare outside of Seoul and weve decided to go to the Lotter World Not an optimal choice to spend your time with kids And mobile app is a garbage it shows wrong waiting time
5870,4,Lotte World is a park that is different than any other youve been to before Most of the park is located in a huge mall with rides stuck in the walls of several different floors There is also a small outdoor section that maximizes its space by going underground Lotte World is not short on attractions but there is no single wow attraction there  a lot of good ones but no marquee Thats the one complaint I have about the park Many of the rides are out of the box purchases from ride manufacturers The rides are in no way modified and just plopped down here or there With all of the rides though how do you make it through everything in a day Use the Lotte World app to book Fastpass times throughout the day You get 3 free ones a day Depending on what you like you should make your choices some combination of Atlantis French Revolution Comet Express Flume and Pharaohs Fury These rides get the longest queues Furthermore youll likely have to cut some rides out because of the volume of stuff there is to do To me the must do attractions are Atlantis Comet Express Pharaohs Fury Adventures of Sinbad and Aeronauts Balloon Ride The rides that get a lot of attention but you can skip are French Revolution Flume and the Conquistador The rides that dont get a lot of attention but you shouldnt miss are Castle Magic Show Fantasy Dream Jungle Adventure and Fly Venture
5871,4,We went to Lotte World on our last day of our holiday Due to the rainy weather we were stayed at the indoor theme park This is great for all ages especially for familys We took the subway to get to Lotte World
5872,5,We went to this theme park as Everland is a bit far and were not disappointed with what was on offered We spent the whole day there and only left when the park was closed Our children love it We took quite a few photo of Cherry Blossom that lined up the park Memorable experience We would recommend it to anyone
5873,3,Kind of wonderland When i was there i thought I went to future  all games and entertainments was by using VR virtual reality devices in some points it was interesting but when you think deeply there were no real activity most of the items were virtual  very few real things
5874,3,I had fun with my friends here The lines were much too long and my friends didnt know what they were doing but it was still really cool being here The food is crazy expensive We had to search for forever to find the one ice cream shop that was more reasonably priced because it was EXTREMELY hot seeing that it was summer Its half inside and half outside so that part was super cool It was my first time seeing an amusement park inside We ended up finding the ice cream shop Since its half inside you could go on a rainy day but I would suggest going when you can enjoy both parts of the park There are many rides that are copies of Disneyland so I would compare it to that Not very thrilling but everything was very cute Couples everywhere Mustgoto if you love amusement parks We ate at the Lotteria outside before going into the park
5875,4,Our first stop is this theme park It nice indoor theme park Enjoyed roaming around this place Ride the giant loop also then the horror house Then going around the place
5876,4,West Edmonton Mall eat your heart out give or take 800 shops and a kids entertainment centre They have a shop for anything you can think of If you love shopping this is a must see
5877,4,Outdoor attractions was thrilling by the looks of it we only rode one because we felt a bit old and our hearts couldnt take the rides haha On the inside there was an ice rink in the middle and VR attractions were everywhere the quality was amazing We spent most of our time inside the Fold Museum because we went to do pottery painting and at the same time learnt a bit about their culture
5878,5,I highly recommend to visit this place in the morning since youll likely spend about the whole day in there Theres a lot to see and a great number of attractions youll want to try Definitely try the Mickymouse waffles outside the main building they are delicious
5879,4,This is one huge mall with plenty of American brand name stores and lots of restaurants It has a great cinema and plenty of space to sit and to explore I am travelling solo but being a father of 2 children it was nice seeing a large section dedicated to children
5880,4,We spotted this while roaming around the Lotte shopping area Though it was 4pm but we decided to go in and explore this indoor and outdoor adventure park We even got a discount as they offer discounts after 4pm on the day Pass There was a waiting of almost 3045 mins on all the popular rides but it was worth waiting in the queue We loved the V R roller coaster and air balloon ride If you have the patience of waiting for 45 mins per ride then its definitely worth buying a day pass to spend a few hours in th evening Outdoor theme park is also beautiful with lots of rides and amazing view of cherry blossom in the spring season
5881,1,Lotte World charged 3 year old children the same rate as 7 year old children and they were not allowed to ride on 95 of the attractions The only place thats best for them was the Pororo Park and it even had separate fees It was highly disappointing and a waste of money We did not enjoy it one bit
5882,5,Didnt get in the Lotte World theme park just went to Team Lab which is the digital art exhibition area inside Lotte World It is a separate unit The ticket price is fair  There are awesome interactive digital art display suitable for all age range Highly recommended
5883,5,Easy to get to at Jamsil station Book online like FuntasticKorea etc to get discount but book 2 days early Lotte world is great value with many things to do kids and teenagers at Magic Island Its welllaid out and split between 7 floors b3 to 4fso spend a day here
5884,4,Great place for family to have fun and spend time What I liked and made it a pleasant place is that they have a halal restaurant and a prayer room
5885,3,Lotte World is for kids Nice outdoor and indoor rides but if you are a group of adults this theme park is not for you I think its best to go to Everland out of Seoul Although its nice to go to the area around Lotte World because of the newly opened Lotte Sky Seoul Tower and it is also nice to take a walk along the Songpa district especially during spring when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom If you are staying at a Lotte Hotel branch there is a free shuttle bus to and from Lotte World theme park Can also easily be reached by subway Jamsil station if Im not mistaken You can go around the park in just an hour or two
5886,4,If you have been to Disneyland and are expecting something similar then you will be disappointed However if you want to spend a day hanging out with your little ones especially if the weather is bad then Lotte World has plenty to offer you  If you do decide to go then make sure you get a discount voucher available from most hotel lobbiesconcierge  you will find that a 20 percent discount will be offered  Getting to Lotte World is easy on the MRT Take the green line and get off at Jamsil station The MRT signs point you towards Exit 3 if you go out this way the head towards Charlotte Theatre and you will see one of the entrancesticket office Another option will be to head towards Exit 4 but you dont have to leave the underground pedestrian footpath to get to the entranceticket office  Its not obvious as it doesnt stipulate in English but a Day Pass ticket entitles you to 3 Fast Passes for rides although Im not sure if this applies for Half Day Passes There are a few kiosks scattered inside that allows you to chose which rides Fast Passes are available on normally within 45 minutes and not beyond Alternatively download the Lotte World app and register your entrance ticket details to access Fast Passes via your phone I believe that if you can buy Fast Passes if you go beyond the complimentary 3 that come with your day pass ticket  Once inside it the multilevel and indoor and outside areas require a certain amount of orienteering Rule of thumb is that the outside area has the majority of the fastbig rides; whilst the inside has about 3 big rides but mainly caters to the young audience We went as a family of 4 two little ones under 7 yrs old went on most of the rides that the children could ride on they are quite strict on height arrived at 1130am and left at 830pm Exhausted  Lotte World tries hard to imitate Disneyland There are parade shows and a fairytale castle but ultimately the lack of recognisable characters no Mickey and Minnie et al make them unmemorable So forget the unmemorable merchandising and just go for the rides  Lotte World does not check your backpackhandbags so you are free to bring outside food and drink with you  PS The cherry blossom has just come into season and there are a number of trees surrounding the outside area that make it more memorable than it would be otherwise
5887,4,A very good park The entrance for one day is 53k won The place is big with lots of games Indoor and outdoors games Some games still u have to pay even with entrance fee The staff are very helpful and friendly  Highly recommend it
5888,4,Theres diffferent types of admission tickets For 6 of us we bought the half day ticket which is from 4pm till 10pm We were lucky to get a 20 discount as we paid using Mastercard There are also discount for certain airlines We managed to ride quite a number of rides as it was not crowded The waiting time varies from 520 mins We had so much fun  laughter there After playing for hours  its time to have our dinner We had ours at Pasha a Halal Turkish Restaurant Located at 2nd floor Food was delicious and affordable 
5889,5,Kids enjoy e rides Its like disney land Very super cold wen its nite Kids love them as have indoor m outdoor gamesrides lotte world is very suitable for young children
5890,5,We told our daughters wed take them to Lotte world on the last day of our Korea holiday as a reward for all the siteseeing wed chosen to take them to I wasnt expecting it to be all that good but it was actually a fantastic theme park Its mostly indoors and there are some really fun rides even for adults There are some inside rides that are extremely fast and upside down and it is a really fun atmosphere we would definitely go back next time in seoul
5891,5,This theme park was SOOO much fun Its so worth the trip There is an indoor Adventure World and the outdoor Magic Island  be sure to get the correct ticket if youre planning to visit both There are lockers to leave your belongings  just remember to bring your ticket with you because they do check it at the rides  We went on a weekday afternoon so it wasnt THAT crowded Be sure to get a map so you can navigate the rides that youre interested in We decided to just pick the thrill rides because we only had a few hours till closing The queues were an average of 3045 mins but the waits are VERY worth it The thrill rides are super fun we even queued twice for The Atlantis Magic Island  Theres loads of FB options and restrooms were conveniently located and very clean We stayed till closing and at about 8pm they have a float parade at the main atrium of Adventure world which is beautiful to watch We really felt our inner children come alive when we were there Im definitely going back on my next visit
5892,4,Really fun but it was really crowded We went there twice the first time we couldnt handle all the crowd and got out after less than two hours The second time only my sister and I went there and it was still really crowded one game queue take one to one and a half hour at least thirty minutes of waiting Other than the extremely long queues I really enjoyed it Visited in Summer of 2015
5893,4,Ive been to Lotte World many times and I have to say I am never tired of going here Its fun cheap with coupons and has pretty cool rides The only downside is that no matter when you go there will always be a line Even if you go on a school day you will see students in their uniform skipping Expect to stay the whole day here They also have themed parades and shows that are pretty cool
5894,4,This is one of the place you need to visit when you are in Korea it has a lot of rides dedicated to all kind of ages However a great tip to avoid long queues and crowds is to go there when it is not their school holidays or any kinds of holiday
5895,4,Take the subway to Jamsil station and walk through exit 4 to park Lotte world offers both indoor and outdoor theme parks and also ice skating area  What I prefer is all the outdoor rides I did not wait in the long line since I went there in the weekday early afternoon  You can also enjoy the restaurants coffee shops and souvenir shops
5896,4,Outdoor and indoor theme park Many things can do there U can reach there with subway and stop at jamsil station exit 3 or 4
5897,3,An indoor theme park great for escaping the chilly weather outside There were many rides but with long queue in lines to get to try the rides My niece was forbidden to go to a couple of rides since they have a height requirement it was so sad after we waited for a long queue The outdoor rides in magic island were mostly for adults In one of the rides we saw that there was a short queue in line so we asked one of the staff if we can go inside the staff doesnt speak English well so it was so hard to communicate when we were about to turn our back because we do not understand what she was saying she pulled us in the corner and with few English words she told us that she will help us go inside but we should be quiet about it and keep it as a secret I think that was what she meant ; Then she gently pushed us inside When we got inside there was still a queue in line but shorter only to find out that the ride we got into The Comet express was not the ride we want to go to It was like the roller coaster plus the seats rotates 360 degrees we were sooo dizzy We were hoping for a lighter ride but we were thankful to the staff forgot her name she did her best for us to experience the thrill  There were many restaurants and souvenir shops around the theme park There was also a musical show and parade of theme park characters It was a nice experience but i would still prefer Everland to visit again
5898,5,There were too many rides and attractions but for the best ones lines were too long Unless you buy an M pass to bypass those in line which is a tad too expensive for me Regardless there are still a lot you can ride or experience
5899,5,This is amazing place I absolutely love it Id definitely go there again If you love carousels slides and different entertainment youll love it here But be ready for long queues I spent more time waiting in line than riding The staff are friendly but English is a problem for the local population And in case its not cheap Plus you probably will spend some money for ice cream or a sandwich all this and more you can buy there easily Just be sure you have enough money
5900,3,We went on a Monday and didnt think the line looked that bad However there are multiple entrances so we didnt see all the people Even though I had installed the magic pass app by the time we found a locker and actually looked at the app the magic passes were already gone for conquistador the flume ride and the loop We went to the little kiddie land and there werent lines this is right at opening However any of the bigger rides were already at 45 minute wait We were so over the whole experience by lunch time It was cold out but the lines outside were also long I saw one line for flyventure at 190 minutes No thank you Lines just ruin my mood especially when you are with kids and came on a nonholiday weekday We also did Everland on our vacation and other than being farther from the city was so so much more enjoyable for us It was not a favorite on our 6 day trip
5901,4,Not much can be said because its normal just like any other theme park in the world Games are fun and interesting
5902,4,Very easy place to navigate and the kids were very happy with the rides Appreciated the option to stay indoors during winter but the lines was massive even on a weekday  Also food options inside was limited and particularly bad coffee  We had a great time and the kids had fun which was the main goal
5903,4,This is an outdoor amusement park with indoor theme park like Disneyland  The indoor theme park has a few 3D shows which are very exciting not to be missed  The queue for the rides in the outdoor park was quite long and we waited for an average of 45 minutes for the rides  Be prepared to spend a day here as there are many fun things to do here
5904,5,Very recommended for a family with young children baby and also teenagers Since it separate to outdoor and indoor game activities for young children and baby the most suitable games is indoor I also took my lunch at the restaurant in indoor games forgot the name since there are many of food kiosk in there
5905,4,Great place to have fun with friends can spend a whole day there There is stuff for everyone to enjoy Very easy to get to from the subway station which is right underground
5906,5,This is great for the family to visit the food is really good and the rides are fitting for everyone Half of the park is inside and half is outside which I really liked because if you get hot outside you can go inside and ride some rides
5907,4,Im going again next week and itll going to be my 4th time there Ive joined tours to Korea before and every time the weather goes bad our tour guide will bring us to Lotte World instead of following our schedule to Everland Cause theres more indoor attraction  It does seems small inside but the attractions were BOOOMM It is really fun and if you know how to get magic pass you can literally play everything in a day Outdoor is LIT too HAHAH cause theres this game called Gyro Drop freefall experience Youll be experiencing zero gravity for 23seconds You wont know when youll fall so take a real deep breath
5908,3,As with all theme parks its best to go early My sister and I arrived around 11 and spent a bulk of our time queuing for rides Go early and run STRAIGHT to the French Revolution rollercoaster The queue there was TWO HOURS LONG  The indoor theme park is likely to appeal more to younger children with animal mascots and princessdinosaur parades
5909,4,This is my second visit and we really enjoy the outdoor game  The place is huge and manage your time efficiently   You can reserve and have the magic pass online or you must q at island magic find the red box at center to reserve therefore u dont have to wait for a game The next reservation is every 2 hour  U can also purchase 5 time magic pass cost you 35000 won or all day magic pass 110000 won  For muslim they have halal kebab rest nearby bumper car and nice muslim prayer at resting area 3rd floor
5910,3,We went on a weekend Overcrowded with people and queue ranging up to 30mins for rides  They have an outdoor and indoor theme park Indoor rides are less exciting Outdoor rides are heartpumping  There are restaurants and cafes as well as souvenirs shops in the theme park  This theme park is more for kids and young people Not suitable for middleaged and above
5911,2,This indoor theme park would probably be really enjoyable for children under 10 and their parents As two adults we found majority of the rides quite tame The rides that looked like they would be more appropriate for us had massive queues of over 2 hours on a weekday and the magic passes had all been used We used the discount coupon from the airport bus ticket but it still was an expensive day due to the limited appropriate rides
5912,5,this park is humanfriendly and lots of fun to explore nice place for a family to spend a whole day at unlike the US theme park you may well want to go again and again even you know those cartoon characters
5913,4,LotteWorld has four levels of rides and in addition there is a massive outdoor area which comprises of massive rides I went with a friend and although we couldnt try everything it is definitely something that a young adult could still enjoy I recommend you to prepurchase your ticket at least 2 days as per requirement from online as you could save as much as 35 Need your passport However there is a downside Massive queues And when i say massive i mean average 1hr wait and this was on a Tuesday and not school holiday period If you are willing to spend some more money get the magic pass It allows you to jump queues Also make sure you bought the Allday passport as it allows you to go on any rides
5914,4,The rides are very interesting Skating rink is at the basement extra fee Very long queue for most of the thrill rides usually about 1hr or more
5915,3,Went with my elderly mum Just to have a look at what exactly is attractive to all the young people Typical indoor theme park We didnt really go outdoor as it was really cold in winter  However most people who visited lotte world would just take all the throat yelling rides and didnt realized that there is actually a folk museum inside There is a miniature of the palace inside Well at least my elderly mum was happy with it
5916,3,Magic pass is the key to avoid long queues Get the apps in your phone and scan your ticket to ensure smooth entry Highly recommended for free entry Fly Venture Muslim tourists need not worry about halal food Pasha kebab available in the park
5917,4,Make sure to go during the offpeak period to avoid long queues for rides We managed to take quite many rides and repeated ones as it was not KR school holidays yet I am surprised with the quality of food was good at Lotte World although slightly pricey but really quite alright Do not pitch it against Disney not quite the same  but good enough It will take you one full day  so make sure you have the time
5918,4,Return trip to Seoul over the Long CNY holidays Me and friends were in Seoul last April for the cherry blossom Didnt managed to visit Lotte world during our last visit  For Muslim Travellers dont be dismay when youre in Lotte world Theres a prayer room and Halal Turkish food Pasha on the 2nd floor and prayer corner I think on the 3rd floor  Ps DO not dine at IRON BULL restaurant as it is not HALAL
5919,3,Seoul must go to amusement park to rival Disneyland Have most of the rides you would want including virtual reality and 3D 4D shows There is a large indoor area where around twothirds of the rides and attractions with the outdoor Magic Island accommodating the others We went on a public holiday in Korea where foreigners get a 50 discount but unfortunately We bought the day pass which was normally priced at KRW 52000 it was so crowded and queues typically had a waittime of between 23 hours crazy It was also stuffy and after a while inside we were dying for some fresh air We were there for only 4 hours and managed just one ride  the Fly Venture If you really want to enjoy the place best to plan ahead arrive really early in the morning If you dont like crowds especially packed indoors this is not the place for you The subway station for Lotte World is Jamsil Lines 2 and 8
5920,4,We went to Lotte World on the 21st of Dec which was a Wed We arrived just after 1200pm We bought a one day ticket for three adults 54000 won each We went inside and were impressed by the color and rides and decorations it looked so much fun But unfortunately it was really busy with a wait time for over 2 hours for most rides We were able to use the express pass app for a couple of less interesting rides but the best rides were already sold out We left at 600pm and only managed 3 rides and saw a bit of a show I am not sure if we came on a unusually busy day but I would recommend if you are going plan to be there early in the morning and hopefully you will have better luck than us
5921,5,If you are going to Seoul during winter then you must go here The place is nice It is located inside the mall The outdoor activities and view is at par with that of disneyland and universal studios
5922,5,In the middle of nouveau rich part of Seoul there is an American dream themed skating ring As in my 20s after another boring or unhappy week at work I went to this skating ring to unwind It reminded me of happy times at younger ages when there were still hopes  dreams Living in Seoul can be a crowded or monotonous experience for some but this place can help one forget everything for a while Pretty  one can go back to childhood dreams in Seoul
5923,5,When we were in Seoul it was freezing cold so staying indoor was the only option for us Lotte World has indoor facilities and these facilities were enough to entertain little kids We stayed there longer than we had expected and had a wonderful memory there
5924,2,Dont get me wrong this theme park looks perfectly fun with all the thrilling rides being outdoor But the Q was like super long more than 90 mins wait for the rides its a waste of time and money to be there
5925,5,A very nice attraction specially for kids and kids at heart who wants to enjoy a modern carnivallike atmosphere Consists of many fun and exciting rides for all types of ages
5926,3,Good Attraction but you need to rethink about your trip plan  This is my 2nd time visiting Lotte World bought the discount ticket 30 off from Trip Maker through my guesthouse and I went there on Saturday and omg that was a disaster Arrived there at 11am and left at 8pm 7 hours I have spent almost 4  5 hours ONLY lining up and looked at my phone   No doubt the rides and everythings are cool and entertaining in the Lotte World both indoor and outdoor but there are sooooo many people; For the most famous rides like Gyro Spin and Atlantis I have spent 45 mins queuing for each lel  I dont think I need to describe how fun it is in the theme park since they are more or less the same seriously yeah Lotte World makes you feel joyful and excited when you step in the indoor park but for real when you get closer to the ride and once you spot the end of the queue and start lining up and wait for 15 mins and wait for 30 mins still a long way to go I am sure you will get mad I was with my boyfriend and we were getting more tired and even stopped talking  I strongly suggest my fellow travellers try to avoid visit Lotte World on FridaySaturdaySunday  My first visit to Lotte World back in 2014 I paid fullprice and only spent 4 hours there becasue I was so fed up with the queuing Thought it would be better for my revisit after 2 years still the samesmh
5927,4,Yes from branded to local stuff You can get everything you in the place There is a supermarket even called Lotte Mart next door
5928,3,The highlight of this park is that its inside It was nice to get out of the cold temperatures but the lines for all of the attractions were so long that we only made it on 4 rides the whole day If you can find a time when its less busy Im sure it would be more fun
5929,5,Lotte world is the indoor amusement and outdoor also You can going by metro and stop at Jamsil It is closer than everland if you stay in Seoul
5930,4,Crowded on weekends Good for families Look for discounted tickets I stayed at Lotte World so tickets were really cheap Dont pay full price  Was there on a saturday  as with young kids attractions that they wanted to sit were not that long q However popular attractions can be 2 hours or more  However place was safe always with activity good food options Stay at Lotte World to have complete seamless experience
5931,4,This theme park is combination outdoor and indoor suitable for all ages and many type snacks inside the theme park
5932,5,Came from Thailand and in Thailand there is no indoor theme park like this one The place is really nice we traveled with the infant of age one year and he likes it  Very good place variety of activities loads of restaurants there is also locker area which makes life much easier  Its another good day
5933,4,Lots to do and the tickets are good value However the queues were simply horrendous Average of 90 minutes to 2 hours for each ride We downloaded the app to book rides according to time slots but there was an online queue too My kid did enjoy it and the balloon rides over the whole park is great for young children
5934,4,Visit this place during weekend on Jan which is their school holiday period The crowd is crazy every whererides u went is que and que avoid going during this period as even if u r there for the whole day it werent be enough
5935,1,Its so expensive for nearly no rides to take Rides are indicated with 5min waiting game time like the bumper car but we waited over a hour Dont go wast of time and money
5936,4,There are a lot of rides to choose from and the waiting time is not too long which is great There is an ice skating rink too There is something for everyone
5937,5,Definitely a well worth visit 2nd time to this place and this time we brought our son to Pororo Park Pororo park is part of Lotte World with separate tickets Pororo park itself is really big enough to spend long hours there He loves it
5938,4,Lotte world has so many different options for the visitor museum is incredible Food available from all different aspects of the world very modern
5939,3,Visited with 3 teens and 2 children age 7  9 on Friday Very crowded and seems there is no restrictions to number of visitors Average waiting time for rides were 60mins and above; some were closed The teens wanted to take the most popular ride  French Revolution were required to queue for 260mins and Magic Pass were fully taken by 1pm They gave up queuing Therefore from 127pm the teens only managed to take 3 rides and the kiddos was about 4 and each ride took less then 3mins
5940,5,My 3 kids love Lotte world as they are young the indoor play is already overwhelming Q is short on weekdays Within 3 hours they played total of 8 rides where 2 of which was repeated twice Tips to take monorail to tour around first  Rem to grab a map  During our dinner its great that the kids was entertained by the Santa Parade  unexpected fireworks indoor  As its winter its really nice for the kids to play indoorsome tips for parents to bring along backpack or carrier to put winter clothing if u visiting during winter time
5941,4,We came here on our recent visit to Seoul The place is on the expensive side even for us American approx 250USD for 2 adults and 2 children under 5the price incl all rides but we spent a whole day in there and my kids are happy We were lucky that the lines werent terribly long Only the balloon ride took about 40 mins wait the rest probably 510 mins All the rides are well taken care of super clean and the staff is friendly Plenty of foods nearby and they are not that expensive We got lost trying to find this place it was pretty long walk from the station Their Xmas parade was a hit with my kids The parade was even better at night time We didnt try the Ice Skating ring ourselves but they looked wonderful Try to come here with a tour company because they will be able to get you discounted tickets
5942,4,Wonderful place filled with lots of activities for everyone Kids teenager youth and adults Though Lotte World is not as huge as Disney World and other Theme Parks around the world it has its own unique attraction such as the insect world and Folk Museum For those who are not so keen with the outdoor rides theme parks there are plenty of shops to go shopping There is also a indoor parade of cartoon characters for the little ones
5943,5,Spent the whole day here as kids Within Lotte World the rides are suited to kids with rollercoasters water rides ice skating rink etc There are small shops of souvenirs and food stalls situated in areas next to every ride but honestly theyre in every corner Outside is Magic Island where the rides are just a tad more extreme nonetheless still suited for younger kids Rides such as French Revolution  a large rollercoaster inside Lotte World hot air balloon and Phantoms Fury have huge queues so start with those first
5944,5,We totally enjoyed our visit to Lotte World We purchased a day pass the kids were worn out before we were able to enjoy all the rideswhich was a good thing All the employees were helpful  friendly Wed definitely visit again Our kids are 12 6  3 years old  our 11 year old nephew accompanied us they ALL had a wonderful time
5945,2,lotte world used to be a fantasy place for kids but people in the know know this place is managed pretty dismally safety issues used to haunt this place while the rides are runofthemill at best dismal parking space still a jamsil landmark no doubt
5946,3,Indoor rides were mostly juvenile and not very impressive Outdoor rides are mostly very thrilling and not for the fainthearted One thing I didnt like was not being able to exit and renter the park on the same day So that sort of limits the food choices if you are going to stay there for the entire day That said there were still a number of choices within the park itself On the whole I prefer Everland and there is no need to visit both parks in one trip
5947,3,Inside the theme park there are alot of thing to play but you need to pray for not raining If rain the outdoor theme park will be close But its not affect for the indoor
5948,5,If you want to have fun just go there but make sure you dont go in weekends cuz you will spend a long time waiting in the lines At 830 pm every day there is a fabulous show dont miss it
5949,3,Stores were highend and much more international merchandise  the prices were not for the budget traveler Insadong had great low prices in the many street markets however Lotte World was a fun place to stroll and grab lunch
5950,4,Older kids will love the outdoor portion of Lotte World while younger kids will enjoy the indoor amusement park including Pororos Park at the bottom level next to the ice skating rink separate admission cost Make sure to ride the hot air balloon ride at the top and take the kids to the indoor play zone with the canon balls
5951,4,There are few indoor theme parks and lotte world is just the one the big one With so many interesting activities for children and even adults lotte world is so crowdy I have to say that I really like it even though I an adult
5952,5,Let me start this by first saying Im a HUGE fan of rollercoasters and amusement parks Ive been to universal adventure island cedar point six flags busch gardens and disney all this year Lotte world was a Great mix of rides rollercoasters and sights attractions There are parts of the park that were a obvious rip off of disneyland Its located inside of a large shopping complex and right next to a hotel Its a MUST visit for anyone with children wanting to have fun on a business trip or just wanting to have something different to do The Main rollercoaster is a BLAST and would rival most coasters in any major park The size of the park and all the things to see and do are amazing and well worth the coast of apprx 65 per person to go in and ride the rides you can purchase a 30 ticket but that wont allow you access to the rides Find the time to spend a few hours you will be glad you did
5953,4,We went to Lotte World on a beautiful October day in Seoul Our guesthouse Mmmio house highly recommended was close to a subway station and from there it took us about half an hour to get to Lotte World on the other side of the river which splits Seoul in two parts Upon arrival at the Jamsil station green line 2 by subway the signs direct you immediately to the Lotte Department Store and other Lotte things to dosee including Lotte Adventure World As we prefer not to wait in line we were excited to see ticket machines which also displayed information in English After having tried all of them we asked staff why the English version on the machines did not work and were told that the machines are not for foreigners Staff very nicely directed us to the counter to buy tickets Second in line suddenly the counter closed and we were directed to another line This was not nice but ok since only about 6 people were waiting in front of us now After half an hour  waiting we could finally buy our ticket but were asked for our passports Not being made aware by anybody that we needed passports I luckily realized that I had a residence card from another country with me A few discussions later with different staff we were allowed to buy four tickets The cost USD 150 seemed high It was a fairly quiet day in the park so the waiting for most attractions was not bad The park has three or four levels and from each level you can see the levels below There is also an outside area with more attractions The park is in the middle of the city and it is quite amazing how they have used the limited space to build so many attractions Although we had tickets which allowed us to access all attractions we did have to pay for one attraction the Tomb of horror or something like that It is approx USD 25 per person Everland is a more recently opened amusement park and bigger than Lotte Adventure World but further away Early 2016 a brand new amusement park will be opened
5954,4,This is the most amazing places ive ever been Who would have ever thought that there would be a theme park in a mall The rides were so much fun Its so amazing how much they can fit inside of a mall Definitely one of the top 10 things to do in Korea
5955,4,My first time in a balloon ride and like any first timer I more than enjoyed the ride being an indoor theme park the space was limited compared to outdoor theme parks like Ocean Park Disneyland etc I also enjoed the Pharaoh revenge ride Also too oir lunch inside
5956,5,Just like disneyland especially when you come during christmas period Im mesmerized by the environment and the weather makes it more better during this time
5957,5,After going here 4 times i know that this place needs a good review After all this place has all the attractions and rides you would love Haunted house roller coaster and many more Not to mention that the staff were all very friendly and helpful I would definitely recommend this place
5958,5,What a experience It is first time i have seen such a good indore amusement park Would like to visit again may be this year or next
5959,3,If you have pleny of time yes i can say go there but if you are tight to the time dont waste your time going there It is not that big enough and nothing much to do there
5960,2,Walking in I was delighted walking out I was so glad to leave We went on a Tuesday got there at 11 place opened at 930 went to the Comet located in the outdoor section of the park Magic which we thought would be like Space Mountain from what I saw online Wait time said 80 minutes I would estimate we waited for 2 hours before we got on the actual ride which was vaguely SpaceMountainish and mildly entertaining but certainly not worth the wait It was hot so we went back inside to try to find another ride All the thrill coastertype rides listed a 120 minutes wait which probably meant 25 hours We wandered around inside a bit more it is pretty cool to look at  they cram so much inside including people until we decided to bail A complete waste of money Tried to be Disney but failed in every way Disinterested employees rides with too little capacity signs ineffective no lie it took us 25 minutes to find the way back out to the street If you must go dont pay the allinclusive ticket 48000 won for adults barely cheaper for kids pay the cheaper ticket price wander around and pay for rides as you go supposedly you have this option if you can actually get on any
5961,5,An indoor theme park with an outdoor area Good for when weather is hot cold or raining Has rides for children as well as adults Very large area Give yourself more time to explore and get around There are some new indoor thrill rides
5962,2,Ok so before you go to Lotte World ask yourself a couple of questions  Do you like lines Do you like noisy eating areas Do you like hidden costs Do you want to feel more like a dollar sign and less like a human  If you answered yes to these then Lotte World is for you  The whole place is terribly busy and designed poorly you feel crampt even not waiting in a line When your waiting in a line prepare for camping a couple of hours with most main rides taking at least 120min wait The rides that didnt are poor or average at best  The eating areas were open right next to rides so prepare for a noisy experience when you want to relax for lunch Like dining in a club  Many attractions inside actually cost money so when you see a big queue and head for the short queue you find it costs \3000  The staff were very rude and not fun They didnt care about their customers and didnt have that fun land happy attitude I would expect from such a place  All in all the place was dull With crampt almost unfinished rendered corridors at parts with dull lighting it almost seemed like each area had its own budget and refused to fund the walkways between  Honestly everything that fails at this place is a win at Everland Some people say they hate the happy music and smiles of Everland but a place like this should be that way and trust me happy cheerful smiles go a long way to make the scene  A final note  Please just accept these things and you will have a good time If you go in expecting a diamond you wont find that just be patient get a snack for the queues and dont limit yourself to a short visit
5963,5,This was an awesome experience and Im so glad I went It definitely feels like Disneylands younger sister who is much smaller but still tries to emulate her older sibling It was fun to go on the different rides and be likeOH this is like Pirates of the Caribbeanor OH this is definitely their version of space mountain They even have their version of Mickey and Minnie The Foxs Lotty and Lorry It was awesome  Solo traveler Im 28 years old I went by myself and I had a blast Definitely something easy and entertaining to do if youre traveling solo as long as you dont mind being surrounded by teenagers  Food I had a smoothie a Popsicle and some fried won tons I thought everything was pretty delicious  Price It was like 40 for an all day pass which means you get to ride the rides I thought that was well worth it I only spent about 5 hours there but I felt like I got my moneys worth
5964,5,This place has all the basic and exciting games; you will enjoy the place its really convenient as its in the city and you can get there by the subway there some restaurants close by that you can visit after your great day in this nice place
5965,5,I took a group of students for a one day outing It was absolutely fun and exciting for the students and myself We rode the water slides ate wonderful treats and enjoyed the entertainment and shops Must see for adults with children
5966,2,We visited today with our 1 year old son We paid 1 ticket for just entry and no rides and the other ticket for rides My son was free The lady that sold the tickets advised that there were rides he could go on Thats why we bought 1 adult ticket that allowed us to ride so one of us could ride with him When we entered there were no rides that he could go on Adventure land for small children was closed for inspection All the other rides for small children were closed We were so disappointed because we wanted to to have some fun as he had been sitting in a pram for a few days while we shopped We ended up paying for entry to Pororo world which was great They had little rides that he could play on and little rooms with padding and he had so much fun there but there is a time limit of 15 hrs I was still disappointed in the larger rides as the wait time was sooooooo long
5967,4,The easiest in term of transportation if you need to go to lotte world Just go to jamsil via subway One of the exit leads to lotte entrance Its also connected to a lotte shoppong mall So you can throw two stone at once The park is extremely beautiful Too bad when we went there its buddha birthday so the rides took hours for us to play Outdoor rides is more extreme and indoor is more to adventure Parade is great And yes theres and ice skating rink available Trick eye museum
5968,4,A DO NOT Throw away your entrance tickets Once inside you will be needing to present them at the entrance of the individual rides unlike Disney and Universals where the only possible condition for the rides is your height So KEEP em tickets  B DO NOT Go there hungry There are a few food options inside and in fact my daughter loved the saussage on the stick But the rest of the options didnt really work out for us Mostly ok for quick snacks again as opposed to Disney and Universals  C After 1600 can get discounted tickets So if you are in the neighborhood anyway Gangnam doing other things this could be a very good option to end the day with Especially since they are open till late  D Well everybody knows to avoid the weekends and Public Holidays But I must add that the day before a Public Holiday many locals seem to be using the After 1600 ticket option we went there the day before Buddhas birthday which is a Public Holiday in Korea and it was totally packed till closing time So DO NOT go there in the afternoons before PH
5969,4,big amusement park in city center there is several attraction indoor and outdoor but its take average 1 hour if you want try each attraction
5970,5,I had no idea Jamsil was going to be that far from our hotel Nor did I think Lotte World was going to be that BIG Upon entering they have no maps or explanations of how big its gonna be Then we learn that it has an inside park of about 5 floors High and an outside park  True it was a Disney knockoff but they did a very good job doing it It also had a very different happy place vibe to it Amazing It had something similar to pirates of the carribean temple of doomraiders of the lost arc jungle ride; a toy story shooting game like 3Dmovie Plus an atlantis roller coaster of seaworld A magic kingdom photoop too  Photos cannot capture it You have to go see it for yourself It was fun
5971,4,Like a mini disneyland hong kong Spent a day here in the rain  most rides were operational Indoor ice skating rink was cool but had to pay extra to get in annoyed but wasnt that much extra The lotte world adventure ticket is already quite pricey  Most kids are more suited for kids but we went on the  gyro drop  comet express really cool rollercoaster ride  the haunted house laughed more than being scared  giant loop heaps fun  Be prepared to wait in line dedicate a day trip here The fantasy mask parade was interesting to watch  mix of asian and caucasians performing Families with little kids may be invited to join the performance as well There was a mirror maze which we had lots of fun in  Overall a fun day out
5972,3,We went there more for the duty free shopping rather than for the rides Good for family with kids Most rides are meant for kids
5973,3,We came here in our last 2 visits to Korea The last was 4 years back Although our children are teenagers now they still enjoyed the theme park in last visit So we decided to go just one more time  The place hasnt changed much getting old and still expensive Nothing fantastic This time round our children didnt enjoy it  This place is more suitable for young kids rather than teenagers Everland is much bigger and better But this is basically an indoor theme park; so dont expect much  This will definitely be our last visit
5974,3,please note that the ticket that you purchase is only for one entry once you went in you cannot come out  there is only one ride that i like  other than that the rest are kids ride good for family with kids but not for adults  the performance is pretty nice too  however if i were to choose i rather give up this and go everland another day  I prefer the performance at everland and the souvenir over there too  The food is average over here too
5975,3,If youre traveling to Seoul for holiday theres no good reason to visit Lotte World There are dozens of better amusement parks in the world than this one Theres nothing special about this place Yes kids will gladly spend hours here and be entertained and I dont believe most people travel thousands of miles to visit a subpar amusement park
5976,3,We visited Lotte World in April 2015 during our trip to Seoul The whole infrastructure is very impressive It is a huge complex with both indoor and outdoor facilities The rides were of high standard and offered some great excitement and are made of modern and quality materials Restaurants cafes and snack stallsstores are widely available and you dont have to walk far until you come across the next one  While everything is huge impressive and contemporary it seemed quite dull and lifeless to me There were some nice things to see but the overall experience was just boring to be honest Im sure its different for kids but there are theme parks that can excite even the dullest of adults  We also found the price to be quite steep the day pass was close to USD 5000 Should you decide not to take any rides their entry fee was still pretty hefty at USD 3100 for a day Seoul is such an exciting city if I knew beforehand about Lotte World; I wouldnt have bothered and would have spent the money going someplace else
5977,4,I find this thempark good for children Very amazing rides and attraction for kids Staff are child friendly Food are also ok for a theme park
5978,4,Lotte world is a nice amusement park for kids and adults There are outside and inside sections that have different rides Inside i enjoyed a very fast rollercoaster called French Revoloution I would also recommend the Haunted house Food was okay Outside i loved a really fast rollercoaster called Atlantis and a spinning coaster that i forgot the name of The Gyro spin and drop looked fun too
5979,5,We visited Lotte World on a Monday for my sons birthday and it was such a good time We took advantage of the 50 off with military ID or dependent  thankfully had the kids IDs too since its only good for 4 tickets We spent 5 hours there and no one did everything but we filled every minute with fun The teenagers and tweens took off and did their own thing at the park even managed to get their ticket replaced on their own when one of them lost theirs Reminder you need to show your ticket at every ride so keep it handy and on each person if possible They did the indoor roller coasters and outdoor ones as well The moms took the younger set to do all that was available and didnt get through all of it Fair food is very good especially the sodafried cheese balls combo always a hit with my guys 9 year olds went on the log flume solo which was about a 15 minute wait at 12 noon and loved it Too bad our favorite ride the Dinosaur 3D target practice was closed for inspection And the kids really enjoyed the trick eye exhibit on 4F This is our 3rd visit in a year and we still havent done it all Took the subway there and back Couldnt be easier or more enjoyable Will probably go again
5980,3,This place tries very hard to be like disney all of its character have a clear disney counterpart and the parades have characters from the public domain that Disney uses Even the rides are knockoffs of classic disney rides Sinbad  Pirates of the Caribbean That being said it was fun to see and the rides were fun Lotte World isnt as pristine as Disney parks but it is cheaper and less crowded All of the rides had fairly long waits later in the day It seemed like when school got out all of Seouls youngsters came here We had fun but I dont think we would go back If you are a fan of Disney parks you need to check this place out it is very amusing to see
5981,5,i go to lotte world in april  and there are little bit cold and that day so many people bcoz there are already vacation  waiting 1 hours to try one attraction  great location and best attraction
5982,5,we went with a bunch of kids from 2 to teenage years and everyone had a ball so much to see and do massive ceilings great musicals and entertainment and you can get a nice meal at a reasonable price Being from sydney its a relief to go somewhere like a theme park without being fleeced at every opportunity definitely a must visit on your trip to seoul
5983,5,Whatever the weather is cold or hot outside you can have a great time in the indoor part The food provided inside is good with reasonable price The attractions are great but some may need to queue up for a long time especially those thrill ride in indoor or outdoor The magic pass is good but you need to arrive early to get those it from the hot attractions ie the thrill roller coaster indoor and outdoor Highly recommended for family
5984,5,Me and the wife took in a whole day here just being kids again a good place to laugh and just cut loose together and its also good for getting your shopping in fun for all ages
5985,3,This is great for the younger kids However when I visited it in 2013 most of the rides were closed because of snow and wind Luckily there was also an indoor segment of the amusement park or I would have had the largest tantrum ever We couldnt go for some rides as theyre only for children below a certain edge My favorite ride is the hot air balloon as you get to see the entire park Indoors And its suspended from the ceiling
5986,3,As it was terribly cold when we visited Seoul we decided to visit this theme park instead of Everland as its nearer in location and has a indoor park The rides indoor are more for children but when you step outdoor the rides are much more exciting Not as great as other international theme parks but it serve its purpose well
5987,4,No giant big roller coaster but fun nonetheless Have both indoor and outdoor The advance booking thing is pretty awesome but limited seats makes it full really fast For thrillseekers go for the outdoor ones first Settle all your adrenaline cravings before going indoor and go straight for the roller coaster  Everything else is average but the house of mirrors is pretty entertaining as always
5988,3,I visited Lotte World during winter and maybe this affected my experience but I couldnt find anything exceptional in this park the attractions are in the average the most interesting part for me was that a big part of the park is indoor and you can arrive there directly with the subway spend time inside and then continue your visit in the outdoor part of the park In my opinion is a good place to visit if you have children and the weather is not the best otherway there are much better park to visit
5989,3,Our travel agent suggested me to visit Lotte World while we waited check in time to the apartment We arrived very early in the morning and it was very cold outside The visit to Lotte World definitely a convenient for us because most area were indoor About the theme park itself nothing too special about it especially my children have been to disneyland before Plenty of restaurants to choose and they have huge rest area to sit down and relax This is useful for me and my husband while waited for my children finished enjoy the rides While waited we enjoy entertainment from the parade and musical performances The excited part is they have hugeeee ice skating ring it will be awesome for those who enjoy it
5990,5,It is simply a huge complex of stores restaurants and park You can find it all inside it and spend a lot of time there It is also crowded of people so if youre looking for a relaxing trip I wouldnt recommend this place It is well served by the subway and located nearby a lake
5991,5,Lotte World is a super fun and unique theme park located in South Korea There are indoor and outdoor rides as well as a concert stage yummy food and shopping there are so many fun rides for all ages the roller coasters are very fun and so are the children rides The Lotte brand characters are very adorable I highly recommend going here If you want a fun and relaxing day in the sun or indoors Lotte world is the place for you Lines were very long on the day i went but it was worth it i highly recommend Atlantis and the Gyro Drop and Gyro Swing the most
5992,4,The amusement park is very spacious  we spent a whole day there My kids tried various games  they enjoyed a lot This park is a good choice in winter We went there on Sat  there were lots of people thus spent lot of time queuing 
5993,3,Lotte World theme park is quite dated in my opinion The outdoor theme park is disappointing Many rides were closed when we visited the place On hindsight I should have spent my day exploring Seoul city instead of Lotte World but my 8 year old daughter quite enjoyed the place She gave it a 710
5994,3,Lotte World is advertised as the Worlds Largest Indoor Amusement Park It surely feels like it The huge dome with its central skating ring and surrounding rides are an impressive sight Having such a large park in the heart of a 25 million metropolis is amazing However Lotte World might not be your best option for entertainment in or around Seoul Lotte World is straight up inferior to Everland ridewise with fewer rides especially thrill rides such as roller coasters which also means that each ride will be packed with quite a long line that can top an hour for the best rides So if youre a roller coaster enthusiast I recommend checking out Everland instead In addition the park is 25 years old and feels like it It doesnt feel quite new especially for outside attractions The parks attractions and stores all have this slightly off color and design that didnt age all too well Also the Lotte World now fails in comparison to the building next door the new 2nd Lotte World complex which features numerous dining and shopping options as well as what will soon become the tallest tower in the OCDE Overall I do recommend checking out the park and its surroundings but would advise against staying there an entire day The good thing is that for people who come in rather late in the afternoon the park offers discounted price and thats a great value proposition to just come in and enjoy the park for 3 or 4 hours rather than the entire day
5995,3,This is easier to access compared to Everland if you do not want to spend too much time travelling First of all spend some time to search out discount coupons which can amount to 50 There are apps like Coupangs that offer discounted tickets Prepare to spend time waiting in queue 40 mins to  1 hour for popular rides and there are about 45 of them in the outdoor area not recommended in the winter months as it will be very cold standing out waiting Indoor rides are mainly for the younger children
5996,5,I went here when it was like 2012 then the day after all the Kpop idols had some Pepero thing there T T It was a really nice experience but you have to be really patient with the queues though But I managed to sit through all of themAnd Im the most impatient person you can find But its worth it I recommend getting all the fast passes or something I forgot what its called so meanwhile you can go play other things that doesnt have long queues after you get the pass D y
5997,5,For those who visited Seoul it is a must for you to visit this amazing amusement park Lotte World where its offers a lot of adventerous games and lots of fun  If you facing time constraint you may go to Lotte World instead of Everland where you can reach there by using the metro line refer website You may also enter after 4pm where the price is a lil bit cheaper But remember to explore all the activities as many as you can before 8pm because they will present you an amazing indoor parade around 820pm All the activities will be temporary stop by then and continue after 9pm  Just enter whatever activities available because youll be suprise with the games and activities
5998,4,Not the best theme park I visited but it still offers good fun plenty of fun attractions and as always with these kind of theme parks be prepared to queue Overall it was fun I kinda wish I went to everland instead haha The good part though is that the theme park connected to lotte mall which is nice they have lots variety of foods and interesting food and snacks to buy as souvenirs
5999,5,The place looks awesome  fantastic for wide eyed kids and kids at heart like me  The kiddie rides are fast queueing The other adult type rides of course have long lines and a waste of stay time  The lunch queueing is worse Aladdin should add more cashiers when the lunch surge kicks in The LONE CASHIER is simply overwhelmed by the volume of people  In all if rides are all that matter then this is the best place If youre planning on getting the lunch ticket I suggest you dont Bring your own food or just get some from the other hotdog cencessionaires
6000,5,My 2 sons 3 and 6 both loved Lotte World We bought our tickets from Lotte world hotel and said to be less expensive than getting it from Lotte world but we didnt go in after 4 We waited almost an hour for the hot air balloon ride and everything else was ok We prefer indoor than outdoor cuz my sons are too little for most of the outdoor rides The later it gets the less we waited my sons went on some rides repeatedly and we were like the last people to leave Recommended for families traveling with kids
6001,5,I had never been in a place like this even in London Tokyo New York Paris is aswome this place is the most luxury Mall in all over the world
6002,3,We went to the Lotte World on Sunday and bought the after 4 special pass tickets since it was cheaper We pay for only 26000 won instead of 46000 won for full day pass As expected the place was packed with people esp some local teenagers Luckily the queueing was acceptable 2030 mins for indoor games and we had the opportunity to enjoy almost all of it However the queueing was crazy long for the outdoor games 5090 mins and we only managed to enjoyed the lame swing tree ride  There is a big carnival parade around the central before the park closed it was pretty fun with lots of people in colourful costumes dancing around Overall it was a good place to having fun and pretend youre in Disneyland
6003,4,The indoor park is more attractive than the outdoor one It is huge inside with loads of games suitable for kids and grown ups Plenty of choices of food at reasonable price The souvenir store is a disappointing though
6004,4,I was excited to visit the place as i love theme parks at first i get amazed to the place since its my first time but after our 2nd ride i feel boredcould u imagine my friend and I was soooooo sleepy seriously i feel that this place is more suitable for kids  Anyway we didnt regret as we got 70 discounted rate thanks god
6005,4,Amazing theme park we went during the Rio Samba Carnival great atmosphere enjoyed thoroughly All the rides are amazing but some of the highlights which i loved were Conquistador the French Revolution the World Monorail and the Flume Ride We also visited Magic Island and the Folk Museum Surely one of the best attractions in Seoul a must visit
6006,4,excellent shows and rides My 4 years old enjoyed it so much we went twice during a 6 days visit to Seoul
6007,4,During my school trip in Jul 2011  we spend a whole day in lotte world There are many things to discover it consist of indooreg roller coster and outdoor activitieseg riding boat muzium artificial hot balloon ride visit i would highly suggest at least spend a day  Amusement park is great services is great They keep smiling and treat us nicely Not only that here they also got Theater room can watch 4d at night we can see live performance consist of dancing  singing
6008,4,I went on a Sunday probably should have avoided the weekend but managed to ride all of the adult attractions in a day  really enjoyed myself Yes the wait in the lines can be quite long but there is wifi  sometimes you can get bumped up the line if you are flying solo  I really recommend the French revolution Atlantis  Comet express rides if you are into rollercoasters  The food onsite was rather average although the treats icecream etc were good
6009,4,This Amusement park is much better than Disney land in Hong kong It is not really recommended for the kids who are less than 110 cm In most of the rides they are not allowed In some specific kids rides you will have to pay little bit extra For the kids who are less than 110 cm the ticket price is not very less  For thrill seeking healthy adults this amusement park is good Reach this amusement park before the opening time so that you can go to the recommended rides You can buy foods inside  I have visited this amusement park in 200620082009 20132014 They change something every year  Good for healthy adults
6010,4,Me and my sister came here and where adults we thought oh why not something to do while in Korea we didnt think it would be that great as its for kids ect but surprisingly we had an awesome day thoroughly enjoyed out selfs laughing all day having fun only bad thing was the lines got really busy and long thought out the day so defiantly go as soon as the doors open as I found it got packed around 121 O clock  Defiantly go
6011,4,Went on a Wednesday as part of a group of 6 3 kids 1 young adult 2 oldies The older ones had a had a good day The younger ones had a great day  We arrived at about 1000 and had the place almost to ourselves and managed to complete most of the indoor rides quite quickly no queues  By about 200 it was getting busy After 400 it was very busy and the main rides outside had long queues with wait times up to 60 minutes The indoor rides were still OK though Did several rides twice  Not as big as I expected and as others have said it is fairly expensive but I think it is still well worth a visit  I would suggest going on a weekday and going early Plan your visit maps etc are available online and do the main rides first Maybe do them twice before everybody else gets there  And the staff are hippy happy and very helpful I dont know how anybody can be that cheerful all day Working in a place like this would drive me crazy
6012,3,80 of the rides are for kids About 5 rides are for adults This is not your adult theme park We went at 4pm and paid 37000 won We ended by 8pm Line up 30 to 40 mins for a 2 min ride Dont waste your time on haunt house Its a cartoon show We did the adult ride only Which are outside the park Fun for 2 mins
6013,4,We went there on monday morning to avoid the big crowds Still there were a lot of people and the crowd got bigger in the afternoon We did some less frequented attractions indoor first but I advise to do the popular stuff first outdoor Atlantis Balloon ride and maybe reserve one of the popular ones with the magic pass to get fast access we did not try it but it should be possible We went there as a couple and there is something to do for every age group Some thrill rides something for smaller children and romantic rides as well Its not nearly as goodbig as disney world and the like but still we had a lot of fun As most of the attractions are indoor its good alternative on a day with bad weather in our case it was really hot so we were always happy to get back to the AC If its raining the outside part might be closed
6014,4,I was with a Tourist Group so I have a fairly limited time in this place Although this cannot be compared to other amusement parks like Disneyland or Universal it is still a really nice place to be having a lot of fun with kids The price is quite pricey but it is well worth it
6015,4,We were late to submit the review We went to Lotte World last December and travelling there was easy via direct subway As it was December winter I supposed the locals escape the freezing temperature and went to Lotte to keep their warm Lotte was extremely crowded and all the rides were in a long Q We managed to grab some interesting rides but the rest of day was spent roaming indoor It was good that it had their Trick Eyes section We had some guns taking wonderful photos as it saved our time having to travel to the actual Trick Eyes in Hondae
6016,2,Lotte world itself is a pretty cool place Easy to access via subway clean and a lot going on I personally went for the sole purpose of ice skating though To start I was quite dissapointed that I could not use my own skates because they where hockey skates That was the first time i had ever experienced that but its a business The ice was crowded your not allowed to skate backwards and for the price of admissionabout 10000won the sheet was poorly maintained If you are going here to skate Seoul has WAY BETTER places than this Check out Mockdong Korea University and IParkwinter only
6017,3,When we first reached there we head straight to Pororo Park We have to pay extra to get in on top of our Lotte World admission My kids 9 and 3 years old had lots of fun running around There is even a carousel in there no additional costs We spent about an hour inside After we head straight to the Hot Air Balloons love how they float them and travel in the Lotte World for one round After this we went opposite Lotte World where the rides are The rides are more for big kids not mine We took a kiddy train ride and head back to the main building The weather was hot and sunny The food sold at kiosks do not taste as good as it looks Souvenirs are not expensive
6018,3,Its so great to have an indoor theme park for the chilly winters but I think thats where the wow factor stops Lotte World while fun is not anything more amazing when compared to its competitors in other parts of the world Its fun I went several times The rides are comparable to those in other areas
6019,5,I loved going here when i Iived in Korea the rides are great and its fun for the whole family I wish they had something like it in the States Part indoor part outdoor fun no matter what the weather is
6020,3,This is a wonderful playground for young kids The queues are very long on weekends but admiring the colourful indoor and outdoor theme parks is already quite a joy You cant compare it with Disneyland or Universal Studios though This is just Seouls famous theme park for the young and young at heart The admission and the restaurants are quite pricey I will not return on my future trips  been there done that just for the experience
6021,4,After reading reviews from tripadvisor we decided to go on a weekday to avoid the crowd Great idea as we could really enjoy games without having to queue Since we didnt have much time we were a bit in a rush to do as much as we could but some attractions are not for every kids depending on the size Our 2 daughters only have 2 years difference but one was below the limit size one was over so for many activities we had to split Not that convenient Overall kids enjoyed it show was pretty lame though and for us it was nice to see them having so much fun
6022,5,Its a MUSTDO in Seoul especially if you havent been exposed to the amusement parks Not crazy fun like SixMountains but you dont have to pay 80 for a day either You pay 6070 for Disneyland HK and Tokyo but I paid only 20; there were plenty of deals to cut the ticket price cut to the half Its not definitely like dreamland Disneyland or Universal Studios or extreme ultimatim SixFlags but I made sure to visit off peak hours so that I didnt need to queue for a while The portfolio or rides and equipments were very well balanced from family to epichigh stuff and the mixture of indoor and outdoor Food inside is quite good but pricey as any other amusement parks There are gourmet restaurants outside the park so make sure to come out and enjoy the food and shopping The parade  circus show are something kids love about Id visit again Make sure to avoid weekend or summer time when youngsters come any time and cause a long queue
6023,3,Our family decided to visit Lotte World instead of Everland because we are staying at Myeongdong and it would be easier for us to go there because its also located in Seoul We were excited at first because we saw a lot of advertisments about this theme park but after a while the joy on our faces vanished when we saw how long the waiting time for each ride is It takes forever for you to be able to ride an attraction They say that patience is a virtue but Id rather visit other attractions in Seoul than to wait there for atleast an hour or 2 to be able to enjoy The only atrraction that wont take too long are the kiddie rides but I tell you they are boring If you want to try their thrilling rides such as atlantis bungee jump and more then prepare to wait for an hour or so
6024,4,Wow this place has changed of course since the last time Ive been here People compare Hawaii to Jeju Island way down south as Disneyland to Lotte World a much smaller version This park has lots of offer for a small amusement park Great for the family with kids of all ages Theres also a huge skating ring inside as well as rides for older kids and adults outside Nearby are great restaurants hotels and a small lake Seokchon Lake which is a nice walk just outside of the park There are nice coffee shops towards the backside entrance of the park and plenty of parking Its been 23 years since Ive been here but still great  On the lower side theres a place called Pororo Park which is great for younger kids Pororo is a popular TV animation which comes to life at the Pororo Park My niece is 4 years old and this place is all she talks about I cant wait to bring my friends back home in the states to this place Brings back old memories
6025,3,Located in a huge shopping complex there are lots of activities inside Lotte World Some of the more exciting rides are located in the Magic Island section which is outdoors  Kids would really enjoy it but its nothing that special The indoor aspect is a bit cool but ultimately gimmicky Time is precious when youre on vacation so if you dont want to spend time in 3045 minute lines for every ride explore elsewhere in Seoul
6026,3,Took a good look at the infamous iceskating rink as seen in Boys over Flowers and that was it Did not take a single ride the entire 4 hours that I was there It was part of a package tour because every ride had a snaking queue which meant a wait of at least 45 mins on average Most of the rides are meant for kids except a few like Gyro Drop which is located at the outdoor section Nice place to stay for 12 hrs but not a place Id go back to again unless I have kids with me
6027,4,Having visited different kinds of theme parks I felt the Lotte world gives you a very cheerful indoor feel Being indoor the sounds of the different rides can be easily heard and felt so this adds on to the thrill My youngest son love the basement rides where all Kiddy rides can be found The hot air ballon also left an impression with our family cos being high up the view of the entire park can be captured
6028,5,Visited in March 2014 with my wife and kid As soon as we entered the parade  Mask festival was on Enjoyed it thoroughly But the evening parade when the lights were on was the best They have so many rides and food courts Best was the hot air balloon ride The trick eye exhibits were also fun Need at least one whole day to enjoy it thoroughly Avoid going on weekends becomes very crowded Need to wait for 3045 min for all major rides But worth the money If you are a foreigners try to get the discount coupons from the tourist information offices across seoul You will get 20 discount in almost all major attractions in seoul We got a 20 discount for the entry tickets After 4pm the entry ticket is less but u have less time and will be crowded
6029,3,First time visited an underground themepark Staffs are friendly but not all Visited there during winter so some of the attractions are closed  Most of the rides need to queue for super long around an hour But overall experience was good
6030,4,the interior design of the indoor themed park is beautiful i love it but for me this is something that the children would really love rather than adults queue is super long too crowded with people
6031,3,So yes very much your typical theme park We gave up waiting in line and left the kids to a full day of queuing Amazing how kids who are continually bored are prepared to stand around for hours for a few seconds thrill  Some of the queues were taking up to 2 hours Outside was much better than indoors but overall nobody would visit again Geared very much to the local market
6032,3,We were there for about 6 hours Add point is it is easily accessible by subway and not easily missed due to the ample signage along the station Given that you are not distracted by the shopping arcade along the way It was on a Friday that we went to check it out It was pretty crowded with tourists school children and local people However the longer queue took only 30 minutes Our kids loved the theme park especially the Camelot Carousel World monorail kids bumper cars and train rides However we were disappointed that the balloon rides for small kids were under maintenance We suggested family with small kids should do some homework prior visiting There were rides that need accompany and most of the rides require kids to be above 110cm It means if you have a 3 yearold he might not get to play those rides he wants to even with accompany
6033,4,Lotte world is easily accessible by public transport and do come here early if you want to cover the whole of the theme park There are both indoor and outdoor areas but do be prepared to queue for at least 20 minutes for the more popular rides Its a pretty place too especially when the castle lits up at night Great place for youngsters
6034,3, Nice atmosphere Wide variety of rides from different age groups   Most of the indoor rides require additional fees on top of entrance fee Oldlooking and not much changes from my visit 5 years ago
6035,2,The outdoor park is very small  very limited rides literally a handful only so mainly teens are there and each ride is jampacked  about 70 mins wait per ride This is the 2nd last week of November 2013 The indoor park is much better  however the queue to the interesting ones are long over an hour while the queue for small children are more tolerable Food options in outdoor park is mainly finger food More restaurant options are available in the indoor park Big bugbear for me is that your entrance ticket does not allow you to step out of the park at all Perhaps this is deliberate to get you to patronise from their eateries since there will be much more cheaper and better food options nearby just outside the park I should not have allocated two days of my vacation to hang around this area
6036,4,If you visit my profile here you will find more detail about Lotte World including video and pictures There is plenty to do at Lotte World if there is rainy weather its okay because there is plenty to do indoors Theres rides for all ages from kids to adults One thing to note is see if there is language translation options as most of all the stories that you listen to while lining up are all in Korea so be mindful of that Be mindful that the front entrance ticket does not cover every ride there are some such as the horror house that cost a little more
6037,3,It couldve fun and much more thrilling if I were a kid But since Ive grown up too much I appreciate thriller rides better Though the park boosts of some rides ie bungee drop  gyro drop the other rides were an ok It couldve been better should I arrived at the park when all the rides are available for us and not under maintenance
6038,4,I rated it very good because Im sure if I was a kid Id love it But I really dont think theres much there for adults to be quite honest Everything there is expensive but youd have to expect that at a tourist place like this It was very busy and the line ups for most rides were very sizable so be prepared to stand in line potentially a LONG time  over an hour wouldnt be surprising  So if youve got kids and are willing to stay the entire day then you might want to check it out If you have no kids in your group then I honestly dont think youre missing too much by not going
6039,2,Lotte World looked better at first sight than it actually was First we arrived and had to pay 44000Won for a full day ticket My friend got a credit card discount and the ticket costed him 12 000Won it would be nice to know about those kind of discounts We got disappointed because the ticket itself wasnt a full pass you need to grab at least 30 000Won more to access everything in Lotte world such as Ice ring Magic jungle Horror house or something like that The amusement park rides looked pretty old from near distance also there wasnt many of them altogether Maybe 58 rides for an adult We skipped the rollercoaster right away because of 45min queue There were two nice rides so I wont give 1 star
6040,3,If youve been to Universal Studios or Disneyland or other big theme parks then I think Lotte World will not be that fascinating anymore  We paid almost 30000 won each with discount Quite expensive for a not so big theme park Its almost similar to Genting Highlands in Malaysia They got indoor and outdoor theme park Quite a long queu in most outdoor rides so we didnt bothered to queu anymore
6041,5,Though we did not took any of the rides it is a good place to visit It has a museum as well that has a replica of Gyeongbokgung that saves a lot of actual walking at Gyeongbokgung we didnt managed to visit the entire Gyeongbokgung  too tired walking The scenery is good lots of things to see and do The Lotte Mart next to the subway is great We shopped and had dinner
6042,4,Never miss the extension of it The magic island The only problem is long queues for any adventure The ice rink is amazing Shopping is awesome The rides are breathtaking
6043,3,I went with low expectation and then end spending 7hoursits not only the theme park but the department store and the food courtreally like the atmosphere specially that it was hot humid day so spending it indoors was a good idea
6044,3,Lotte World makes a good place to kill time and is also popular with young student groups or dating couples The rides are not as exhilarating as those you would expect from a Japanese or Australian theme park The indoor area rides are catered more for children to teenagers Outdoor area is not as big as what a first timer would expect and is more for adults rides If you wish to hit only some rides before you leave I would recommend the Atlantis as even people with lower threshold would appreciate The Gyro series maybe a tad bit intimidating for the weak hearted
6045,4,Been there on my recent Summer trip in August Was there from abt 11am 930pm  It was a rather gloomy morning with slight drizzle so it wasnt too crowded  Took the Gyro Drop and Alantis outdoor rollercoaster with a 15min queue Then watch some Kpop highschool musical show and some parade  The crowd started streaming in after lunch hour and queues started to form  Took the French Revolution indoor roller coaster after a 45min queue  then roamed around more took ALL the rides we passed by and left after the Laser Show   these rides are the most worth it if youre into highspeed twist and turns if you scream during a viking ride you should give them a miss lol
6046,2,We went to Lotte World last week and it was flooded with mainland Chinese tourists We went a little after 4pm on a weekday afternoon and definitely did NOT have a good time We went up to the top floor three times to check on the wait time for the hot air balloon and it was over an hour each time so we didnt bother We did manage to do the monorail and it was OK Our young kids 5 and 7 enjoyed the bumper car rides and treebees hopper and Kidstoria but it was not a fun experience for the adults  The cafeteria was clean and served basic food at reasonable price like everywhere else in Seoul  The overall decor is cheesy and dated and there are few English language signs around No comparison to Disneyland please save your money and go somewhere else
6047,5,I went there for the first time in 1998 and returned 13 years later but still I was thrilled by the largest indoor amusement park in the world What impressed me the most was the musical performed at the garden theater it was awesome And since it was winter Lotte world was a perfect choice to spend time without catching cold I will definitely go there again
6048,4,My kids love this place so much They tried several games indoor  outdoor Unfortunately some of attraction had a quite long line The place is quite far from our hotel in Seoul  Tips Theres a huge indoor games So dont be so disappoint if its rain  Tips Be there as early as possible in order to avoid long que to ride
6049,4,Our 2 year old had a blast There are countless rides for her age group compared to other amusement parks The fantasy forest with animals like squirrels rabbits and guinea pigs were bery enjoyable for her Overall I will recommend it if you have little kids or if it is a rainy day in Seoul
6050,2,Its very small in terms of size or and facilities A lot of the outdoor rides are close In terms of technologies they are really outdated as compared to Everland  If you have small children probably they will still enjoy Lotte World But if yours are teens then dont waste the entrance tickets fee
6051,3,This place is good for families with small kids The indoor attractions cater more to small kids Indoor attractions cover a bigger area than the outdoor attractions
6052,3,We 2 adults went on the eve of their PH And literally all the rides are snaking long we queue arnd 30 mins for the monorail ridesseeing the queues for other rides we gave up and just walk around instead  Will still very much preferred Disney land so do not set too high of a standard before visiting to prevent a huge dissappointment like we do  It is still a wonderful fairy land for the kids to spent the day here though as theres a section cater to the younger kids mini version of bumper car etc  their Pororo land which seems interesting
6053,4,Brought our 25years old son and he enjoyed very much Especially they have lots of rides suitable for his age However food wise not much variety and expensive which is typical of theme parks Lots of space for him to explore and run around Best to avoid weekends as queue to take a ride takes more than 30mins
6054,4,Its an interesting place for entertaining as well as shopping There are a big ice skating inside the building and a monorail running from the building to the outside area Goods in the center are variety and mostly Korea made with good quality Price is normal not too expensive
6055,5,The attraction and the show are fantastic No wonder disneyland and universal studio dont want to open their heme park at seoul The size is big you can spend a whole day at this place
6056,3,If you are joining tour and this is included you will be disappointed as there wont be enough time for you to explore in a mere 4 hours Spent most of the time walking around indoor and to the outdoor theme park We only got on 3 rides Nevertheless my daughter aged 7 had a splendid time in Pororo Park which is located in the indoor theme park Additional entry ticket is require though
6057,4,This is one of best places for kids in Seoul My kids love to go to there whenever we visit Korea Most theme park is pretty same but this place provide lots of attraction for kids such as magic show and small concert I highly recommend if you come to Seoul with your kids you have to go They love it
6058,3,IMHO its better to go Lotte World during winter than Everland because its indoor park can be enjoyed throughly without freezing Nice place with many rides but the queues can be very long What I dont understand is some rides require you to pay to enter even though you have paid the day pass
6059,4,Entry after 4pm is discounted and foreigners also get a 15 discount It was pretty busy with teenagers and families on a Friday night Be warned that some rides close early in the evening so plan your trip well The rides are fun with Atlantis being the best Although there were some very long lines there are plenty of places to eat drink and hang out Yes its lame but youll have fun
6060,3,If youve been to other theme parks this one is a bit old and it seems nothing new there We waited 3080mins for one game probably because it was near new year But its always fun to go with your friends family or special one
6061,3,Lines for most popular rides are about 45 minutes to an hour Same as any other amusement park during the holidays The kpop show was interesting
6062,4,The worlds largest indoor theme park has an 80s feel to it but my kids didnt care there was a ride for everyone from the simple kiddy ones that my 4 year old loved to the scary ones Gyro Drop French Revolution that my oldest wanted to try  There was also some odd whymiscal rides that felt wierd but generally it was a day well spent  Not too crowded and although we had to wait 10 minutes to get on the French Revolution roller coaster it was the longest wait the whole day  Even though the crowds were queuing at the Gyro Drop the large number of seats and the quick turnaround meant that it was only a five minute wait try to find that at most other Worldclass theme parks in Asia  The choice of food was somewhat limiting as we couldnt find a good dining place that satisfied the tastebuds of both adults and kids at the same time but in the end we tried something simple and it worked out ok  Might not be back again but it was definitely worth trying once 
6063,4,The Lotte World Park is besides the Everland Park in Yongin City the only real Entertainment Park in Korea This Park is significantly smaller but can be visited all year long as most of the attractions are inside
6064,4,Lotte World is a decent way to spend a day in Seoul There are plenty of cultural and historical attractions in this mammoth city but if you just want to shop eat and have fun on rides this is a good place The indoor amusement park is not the best but its entertaining There is also an ice rink in the bottom that is pretty fun too
6065,5,This is amazing place Koerans showed how creative they are They created a theme park half indoor and half outdoor Indoor theme park itself is big enough to cover a full day It is many times better than Disney Paris We got a foreigner discount of 30 Just ask before taking the ticket Check in information center before taking ticket for discount coupon
6066,4,Havent used it just was in nearby hotel Looks like a good attraction for kids and teens together with a large shopping center inside and various options to spend a day
6067,3,Ive visited Lotte World several times over the past 15 years It really hasnt changed much in all that time The rides are mostly old school While it is not the best amusement park youll ever visit it has a cheesy charm that makes for a wholesome and interesting day Kids under 12 will love it The Atlantis roller coaster was actually quite fun
6068,2,This amusement park is not worth the price of admission The rides are geared towards young children The adult rides have extremely long lines and not very exciting I will not go again
6069,3,Me and my friends went to Lotte World last year The indoor park is suitable for kids and family Outdoor rides were awesome We spent few hours to explore the whole Lotte world They have special price for tourist Grab your tickets and enjoice
6070,4,Huge beautiful indoor amusement park and shoppings connected to Lotte World Hotelthe rooms are beautifulGreat place
6071,4,May is full of kids and students from school picnics This is one of favorite places for those familes the ticket prices is a bit costly however if you stay whole day it is ok I am not sure if you can stay in an amusement park whole day but children can
6072,4,Half of the park is inside and the other half is outside I love the atmosphere There is a lot of tagging on walls and pillars I guess young teens like to leave there memories on everything the rides were fun I found it funny that all the entertainers are foreigners
6073,5,Lotte World is so much fun It can get a bit crowded around holiday times But its definitely worth visiting especially for couples
6074,4,My sons enjoyed this amusement park although we found most of the rides were either very kiddyish or too wild There isnt a lot in between Still they enjoyed the flume ride drunken basket spin Tree Swing monorail aeronaut balloon ride and theatre shows  It was quite chilly when we visited so we spent more time indoors than outdoors That was what attracted me to this amusement park in that we could do something indoors away from the cold and that it was also accessible by the Seoul Metro Jamsil station  Toilets were clean Wish there was better variety of food apart from burgers hot dogs and candy floss Seems to be a lot of junk food on sale  We purchased one day passes which allowed us unlimited number of rides Games require an additional charge  Would we visit again Once is enough Probably will try a different amusement park next time we visit but the weather has to be right
6075,4,If you visit Seoul  one place you should visit is Lotte World Jamsil Seoul Its a very huge shopping mall and amusement park in 1 place Its the best attraction especially in a cold weather because you can choose the indoor amusement park They have 3 different entry tickets based on which hour you get in The later the cheaper one
6076,5,Lotte World is a riot Peanut Butter Dried Squid anyone A roller coaster named after a horrific time in history  The French Revolution And please do take notice of how similar the Lotte Castle is to the Magic Kingdom and how the Lotte Raccoons look like well Ill let you figure it out
6077,4,Most families and children we saw during our trips to Seoul We got there in time for the evening parade  like a miniature Disneyland electrical parade Their characters are cute animals like racoons There are some rides but seems like for little children indoors We did not have time to see what was outdoors but give your self several hours to explore The food like any theme park is very expensive even for a hotdog and coffee We visited in February 2011 There are many stores connected to Lotte World as well as Lotte World Hotel
6078,5,From theme park to dept stores to buildings to fast food to confectionary to supermarket they have it all
6079,1,It was too cold for the outdoor park so we stuck mainly to the indoor park rides are not so thrilling but there is enough to last a whole day but does not warrant a second visit
6080,4,Its an interesting concept to have an indoor amusement park at this scale it is visually impressive and reasonably clear to navigate The downside is the enormous queues typical to all Asian amusement parks
6081,4,This theme park was packed with more adults than children The rides were fantastic and I was impressed that so much awesomeness could be encapsulated INDOORS It was not at all expensive for the day and its placed in a mall so there are plenty of options for dining both inside and outside of the park
6082,4,I went with three friends and had a great time There is several fun attractions with all different levels of thrill They have a super fast but short roller coaster and also a pretty scary free drop outside they also have their daily parade and shows on stage  In the Center inside they have an iceskating rink which is always appreciated The only thing that I didnt like was the burger with fries and sometimes the queue can be a bit long
6083,5,Tip wear comfy shoes bring wind breaker  Good in a way Not much to buy except food But we like to bring home something as souvenir  for all season not seasonal items all items for sale were for halloweens only
6084,5,At 7 pm eveyday there is a parade of the show characters and their special decorated vehicles
6085,2,not well maintained needs repainting sound system terrible cast is very good
6086,5,I thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Lotte World We were staying  Hotel Lotte World which is next door to the amusement park  We got the discounted fee KRW 15500 as we reached the park  800 pm  Do make a note that most rides shut by 915 pm You may want to plan your trip accordingly  Some of my friends couldnt ride on the Turbo Drop which according to me is the best ride in Lotte World A few of us were the fortunate ones to take the last ride for the day on the same All requests to take our friends on the said ride fell on deaf ears  Both the rollercoasters were loads of fun  I would definitely recommend a visit to Lotte World Do make sure you go on a weekday  later in the evening if possible 
6087,5,We loved it We played lots of stuff while my parents went to the great duty free shop It was great
6088,5,It is situated right outside Jamsil subway station Green Line and the 1 day admission fee is reasonable 38000 won There are many attractions in the indoor themepark and most of them are suitable for children and family  The outdoor themepark at Magic island has a few extreme rides The Gyro Drop is highly recommended if you like the feeling of instantly being sucked down to earth from 70m above ground Also Atlantis Adventure a super fast roller coaster is also one of its main attractions It has a few big drops and the speed is extremely fast Highly recommended if you love great speed and drops There is also a Bungee Drop similar to the Gyro Drop but shorter and not so extreme  Worth spending a day here
6089,3,I like going to theme parks  specially with friends and when in Seoul Lotte World is a must visit     only if you just want to be done with a checklist with Lotte World listed on it  Sure  the place is cool the indoor and outdoor park is great  what I only was not prepared for was the long waiting time to be able to ride an attraction The lines are awfully long  and I went there on a regular school day and during winter I wonder how long the lines are during weekends One thing is sure the Seoulites do enjoy their theme park with much fervor Im beginning to visualize the lines once the Universal Park opens in Seoul I enjoyed roaming around the indoor park and watching the Parade and the light show at closing time Will probably have second thoughts about visiting again  the long lines really are a big turnoff
6090,3,There are many kind of attractions suitable for adult The gyros the best So sad the muslim prayer room is closed due to covid and there are no other place to pray
6091,5,I really like this place It has everything that I wanted in Lotte World Has a variety of restaurant a lot of amusement including ghost houses The night view is wonderful too
6092,5,The place is located in middle of jamsil area in Seoul there is a discount if you visit at night Lots of snacks too
6093,4,Nice day out good fun indoors and out lots of places to rest eat and drink Suitable for all ages
6094,4,This is a good theme park for children to have fun when travel Seoul The theme park is at neat downtown that not far away travel need
6095,4,Came on a week day but there were loads of people glad we took the tickets with the magic pass and saved a lot of time from queueing overall had a great time
6096,3,Avoid going during public holidays school holidays and weekends The queues are so long It takes 1 hour to queue for any ride The plus side is that its cheap entry tickets
6097,4,I visit Lotte World on Sunday and the weather is light rain unfortunate for me Because the most extreme ride is closed The rest is just good
6098,3,We went on a Thursday wait times for the 3 rides worth going on were 7080 minutes It is more aimed at younger children than teenagersadults Definitely not a must do especially if youve already been to a Disneyland before
6099,4,We visited Lotte World during our recent trip to Seoul Great for all ages I like both indoor and outdoor rides Negative points Queueing was 100 minutes for one ride We didnt ride any of the popular rides because the queues were 90 to 110mins per ride This is a whole world of entertainment Outside park inside entertainment food hall and shopping  mall
6100,5,Skip the extra fee for the horror tomb Skip the extra fee for the horror Skip the extra fee for the horror tomb
6101,5,Went with some friends to Lotte World and had a blast at the park Made us feel like we were kids again 
6102,5,all the games is functions i prefer lotte world as the location is convenient to travel by subway and the waiting queu is not too long but depends on days you visit it
6103,4,This is a fun indoor park to visit while youre in Korea There are plenty of activities for the young and old alike
6104,3,Its been around forever and if youre a foreigner on sight seeing no need to go inside unless you are up to ride some in the theme park Mostly very crowded with kids and teenagers and family units There arent much alternatives around the city anyways
6105,3,The main attractions were closed however there was no notice when we purchased tickets Waiting time is up to 90 min so suggest to buy a magic pass Good for children up to 14 maybe Mine were 1416 so not really interested
6106,4,Went on a rainy day so was a bit disappointing cause the whole first floor was closed all the rides and the good stuff its anyway nice insidecome as early as you can very long lines are waiting for you xD  couples
6107,3,Check in was easy and friendly Obviously the location is excellent if you like to shop or go to Lotte world theme park Theres a subway station right in front Not a lot to do nearby once the mall closes at 10 My friend enjoyed the sauna while my teens enjoyed the theme park The beds were comfortable but the rooms had no drawer space Hotels bakery did have much but theres plenty to eat a decent breakfast at the underground shopping go downstairs thru the Lotte department store doorway Theres lotteria angel in us coffee shopbreakfast sandwich krispy cremedoughnuts samsong bakeryfamous breadpastriesodeng place that opens before the mall opens Then theres the food court at the mall Take the end elevator to get a great view of the outdoor theme park I would definitely stay again if the price is right
6108,4,For the winter season it is good to visit Lotte World because they have both an indoor and an outdoor theme park If it gets too cold for the kids outdoors then just bring them to the 4storey indoor park
6109,4,Never miss to visit this Amusement park if you are in Seoul with your kids There are lot of rides shows and a whole lot of eating options And not to be missed is Carnival parade which boosts of more than 200 performers singing and dancing as they take a round around the park The park also stages various themed musicals at their central stage where one can sit and enjoy them Beware most your time may be spent waiting to take the rides nd be ready to shell out more for your food than it is worth This park is huge plan full day here
6110,4,Visited Lotte World as part of a tour group package Spent about 4 hours here from 5pm to 9pm Place was semi packed with mostly couples and families Certain attractions such as the horror house and mirror maze requires an additional fee of 3000won to enter  Most of the rides were mild as this is a family theme park Do try the ice skating rink on the lowest floor and there are several food options around to choose from
6111,4,Be prepared to wait in lines and youre fine I visited during super hot August and the lining was horrible However the attractions are fun and different from the ones Ive been in other countries I highly recommend the indoor roller coaster Comet express and Atlantis Adventure roller coaster Just the indoor park itself is a sight to see Go early in the morning if you want to experience everything
6112,4,Lotte world celebrates its 30th anniversary this year 2019 and there are many shows and nice decoration around the theme park to commemorate that The rides are still fun despite some of them being really old and insanely popular
6113,3,The warmth in the indoor theme park was very welcome with the freezing cold outside However the indoor rides were more for smaller kids less than 12 years old probably Very long queues on a holiday and weekend We stayed in an AirBnB across the theme park so transportation was not a problem
6114,3,We spent a Thursday afternoon at Lotte World indoor It is great for the 64 yo that we have but it was so crowded Every ride took a long wait and it felt that rides for small children were all filled by teenagers We spent US150 for ultimately 4 rides and that took us 3 hours and all our energy Safety precautions seemed way over the top eg all had to wear a safety belt in the carrousel
6115,4,Avoid at Christmastime Great place to visit but queuing for 2 hours for most rides took the shine off I dont know how much a magic pass is but I think it would be worth investigating to go to the front of every line
6116,4,Lotte World is a large indoor theme park covering multi stories and including an outdoor area The rides range from kiddie rides through to relatively large roller coasters that older kids will love If youre coming in winter be prepared to layer on and off if youre going to be in or outside  Best to arrive first thing when the crowds are small and queues are short  go to the most popular rides first  Atlantis French Revolution Pharaohs Rage etc otherwise be prepared to queue for up to 2 hours when the crowd builds up especially in the holiday season  The park is clean and well presented and offers a Disneyeque feel complete with their own Snow White Castle  The entry ticket we got 20 off using MasterCard is generally all inclusive a small handful of rides require extra payment There is a range of food from local to western Prices are generally higher than outside  There is a Lotte World app that can book Magic Passes like Disney fast passes but we couldnt get them to work; perhaps they need to be booked first thing So suggest some preplanning is essential to get the best out of the park
6117,5,We visited with a 6 and 2 year old  Both had a great time  the oldest went on several rides and the little one enjoyed the carousel and playground It was very busy as it was close to Christmas so we left before taking full advantage of all the rides and activities We loved the Christmas shows
6118,5,It was wonderful and amazing I love the place very creative and colourful My favourite part was the ice skating The best part was the parade with all the fiction characters
6119,4,Indoor and outdoor theme park Good for cold weather as you can just do the indoor rides The museum on location is definitely worth a visit as well Hidden gem Quiet as most of crowd would be at the theme park There are several eateries at the exit of the museum The eatery closest to the entrance of shopping mall offers cheap and good food as compared to the other eateries on the same floor It is small and looks less expensive  food is good value for money
6120,5,While the equipment and rides show signs of age it is a fun place for kids Its mostly I doors so great for cold weather
6121,5,My children love this place indoor and outdoor park However my kids is 7 yrs old and 3 yrs old couldnt play most of the game but still great for this trip definitely will come again hopefully when the children able to play everything
6122,3,Went on a Thursday some rides were undergoing maintenance DO CHECK THE APPWEBSITE BEFORE GOING the rides which were down were some of the main rides long queues for the comet express  french revolution 100 mins there is the magic pass app where you get to try your luck to get an express pass at a specific time slot you can do it at the kiosk too The day I went there were many students there making it crowded  almost 90 were students which was really different from my Everland experience  Food selection was decent its not super big but its good and the location is still in the city which makes it convenient and its near lotte mart for food shopping
6123,3,Though I dont ride all the rides I just embraced the view and surrounding a moment when you wish you are young again I dont think is as big as Everland that I heard of bring a huge place but since here the location is great and accessible by using metro when you do not have enough time while in Seoul but just enough to experience the moment of being young at heart
6124,5,Upon entering the facility it is clearly evident this building offers the full gambit of stores and sporting  eating highlights Whilst the wife does extensive shopping there are numerous coffee shops restaurants cinemas highest lookout in Seoul aquarium play arama and games facilities  ice skating rink
6125,4,What a fun day at Lotte World So many rides and lots to see It is difficult to navigate around There is so much packed in that you dont see all the rides unless you go down every street and every corner It is really tough to find the stairs or escalators as well Lines arent long but the wait to get on a ride takes forever They could introduce more efficientcy by counting passengers while the ride runs and limiting the number of Magic Passes allowed on a ride We went on a Monday and not a super busy day but wait times were 4560 for the more popular rides
6126,5,Actually everything there is amazing but the problem is all the time crowded and alot of people special after 12 pm but in weekend from when lotte world open until close they accept millions of people to much people and if you need to play sometimes you need to wating like one hour for one game or 2 hour i just suggest to visit there but in weekdays spical in middle of the week
6127,5,Reminiscing back our childhood days at this place Was so fantastic that you would say to yourself its nice to be a kid again
6128,5,Suitable for kids age 3 and above to enjoy the rides in the indoors  It would take up the whole day
6129,5,Our two boys had so much fun in Lotte World It was Halloween themed  The Virus Rides such as Gyro DropPirate Ship Sinbad were fun We had ice cream and hotdogs Best of all we had fun at the VR area We oldies simulated hang gliding while the two boys took several turns with their war games Best to go to Lotte World when it opens at 930 am get the best out of the trip
6130,4,Park was very gigantic and price is very reasonable Nevertheless after several hours of being inside we started to get bored as the attractions are mostly ordinary Furthermore food is also above average in terms of price
6131,4,The Lotte World in Seoul is an Amusement Park in its own If you like water activities and other fun amusement it is worth spending time there As it is not cheap you should allow time for best value for money
6132,5,If happen anyone in Seoul Korea  Im highly recommend this cafe for tiramisu at basement foods area  This cafe specialise In Tiramisu Theres variety of choices for tiramisu  The best recommended and my favourite is the mix berries and chocolate ones  Check it out from the photo for the cafe name
6133,5,I was unwell right at the start of my two weeks working trip in Seoul Upon knowing of my condition since 13 Oct 2018 the Club Lounge staff had been very concerned each time they see me and during breakfasts would recommend what to drink and eat to better manage the condition of my extreme throat inflammation Specifically on the 13 Oct 2018 morning the two Club Lounge staff had helped to find the nearest clinic for me upon request and followed up with me on their own accord an hour later if I was going to the clinic Another special mention would be the male lobby senior staff who upon my inquiry of direction brought me to the clinic for fear I might find it difficult to locate  Very thankful for the concern and dedication of the hotel staff during my visit to Korea this time Grateful to have made the acquaintance of the hotel staff  Regards Room 3002 Guest 8 to 18 Oct 2018
6134,4,Long queues everywhere and it is quite confusing to use their app to book the timeslot for the rides as there are no instructions on how to book for foreigners  Aside from that it is quite interesting and fanciful Theres restaurants and shops inside for you to shop your worth while you are there
6135,3,This place is a large impressive shopping mall with everything from vans the Louis Vuitton If youre an expat theres also an On the Border so you can get a Tex mex fix Great for people watching too
6136,4,Sweet little theme park that is not overblown Good for kids big kids and adults who are kids inside Great way to enjoy a day  Lotte World theme park is not overly crowded Most rides will require about 3050mins to line up for Indoor activities are quite numerous but are aimed at younger audiences Be warned some 4D rides can get you very dizzy Outside is fun but can get colder at night  No extreme thrill rides such as a crazy roller coaster and some rides are notin operation AppWeb is not updated about statusThey have some theme halloween but arent as committed as other parks Lotte mascots are not as relatable to foreigners
6137,4,the theme park is very good especially the rides though there are rides that takes time because of the long line waiting to get to the ride but all in all the experience is memorable
6138,2,We visited the park on a Saturday and it was very crowded and busy  without fast pass we had to queue about an hour for each ride We gave up after two rides  and went shopping at the lotte supermarket instead 
6139,4,Very nice place for families and young guys Many games and attractive shows Full of fun and enjoyment Must try it
6140,5,Huge Alot of shops there and alot of things to do Prepare your cash Alot of shopping till you drop
6141,5,I spend 1 week at the lotte World hotel Jasmine location The hotel is extremely clean but what makes this hotel stand out is their staff  one of the best customer service I received  especially if you meet Rain and Suzie who worked at the executive club They went above and behind to make my stay an excellent onealso location location location 1 minute walking to the subway I will defiantly rate this hotel 45 stars Kansameda lotte staff
6142,3,Lotte world is good for Kids at heart  Still fun but if you been to universal or disneyland you will be disappointed  Good thing with Lotte world though is mall is just right there too with a bunch of places to shop for  But entrace is quite expensive if you buy there in the spot find some cheap ticket online  Food wise its good theres various selection  Jamsil station is right there as well and they have lockers on the train station 
6143,5,Even though Im not a child I loved it great place to take kids lotto world is located inside a shopping mall so theres always plenty of things to do it has alot of rides shows and food i do recommand to see lotto world especially if you have kids
6144,5,Visited one weekday in December but I guess it was school holidays it was so so crowded The kids went crazy at this place lots of kids ride and the queue was long for each activity We spent one full day here We did not play the outdoor activities as it was freezing cold Hope to pay this place a visit soon
6145,4,This is an indoor theme park which is good for kids aged 411 years old Half a day will be enough
6146,4,Very crowded on the weekend My 6 years old did enjoyed it as we changed plan from a private city tour to half city half Lotte world day because it was too hot to walk around palaces and other tourist spots I felt the indoor amusement park could have been cooler but with the outside heat and too many peoples inside made the AC seem it wasnt working well Lines are long minimum 30 minutes wait Wish I bought the magic pass that could of save us lots of time Final thought been there done that and will not come back
6147,4,Well like many theme parks this smaller than Disney indoor them park but very nice especially during summer It has a lot of entertaining activities like trains air balloon and some festival performances if you havent been to doesnt before this is a mini introduction  Manal Oman
6148,5,Shopping food and entertainment Must do the tower and get a great view of the city It does not disappoint
6149,5,Last time we were here was 23 years ago making it as our 2nd stay here Our vacation this time is longer than our first time in Seoul We stayed in Myeongdong and Busan first before transfering here As expected everything is still in tip top condition Everything is accessible Train restaurants 711 malls and even lotte world which is my kids favorite place to be Staffs were polite and helpful Will still be back here on our next trip to Seoul
6150,4,Disney meets asia with this gem From water slides to roller coasters along with a massive ice skating ring this little commercial gem will not disappoint The flying advertising drones do not distract and are a fun part of the ambiance Plenty to see and interaction makes for a fun family experience
6151,1,The bad reviews for this place is correct Waste of time and mony 60 aussie dollars to get in and too busy to get on a ride where u have to pay moreeee
6152,5,This was a great place to take our kids 9  13 Theres 4 floors of rides and games Theres also a lot of fun thrilling rides outside the building that kids and adults will have fun on We spent about 8 hours here just playing games and ice skating
6153,3,there are lots of things to do at this theme park it is very loud by my standards but also a must see experience I wish ice skating was included
6154,5,I have stayed here at least 56 times and every time the staff in the hotel at the club lounge are excellent  Great service always smiling positive feelings for guests The manager and his team are very friendly and helpful  Rooms are nice and quiet with molten brown amenities Same old nice touch with no reduction in quality  always of a high standard  Breakfast and the evening snacks are superb High quality food always  Kloud beer bar at the basement is also very nice and not overly priced  Location is super as you have a subway Jamsil station and a super mall beside and the new 123 floor little observation tower  Only gripe is the tax refund people  not part of the hotel  are rude The young lady needs some training to be more polite to tourists who pay your salary and reason for your job If you are still rude to such tourists who are your customers then you will be out of a job Be nice I dont owe you money and I can return your tax if you feel that you deserve it I pay high taxes back home too just so you know
6155,3,Nice place for children a lots of game available inside and outside the park for all ages  there is also show from 8pm to 830 pm and all games stop at the show time
6156,5,I went there with my wife and 6 years boy We spent all day here from open to close It was really fun and lots of things to do Enough to spend whole day And if you stay lotte hotel next to it you can buy discount coupon for all day free pass Must visit place if you visit seoul
6157,5,Hotel Lotte was a bit old but very well maintained The character room gave good excitement to my sons; 6  8 especially due to its Wii Service is also excellent I emailed them in advance to enquire about the beds since I only managed to book nonsuite character room with 2 twin beds but they helped me to get a room with a queen bed and a single bed with trundle which is exactly what I need  The location is indeed convenient from the Lotte theme park which is in the mall next door with a connecting passage  Price is on the high side but with all benefits above its quite worth it Will come back again
6158,5,We spent the whole day in this theme park with 4 kids under 6 2 seniors and 4 adults Had a great time enjoying the Lotte theatre shoe the samba parade which was the current theme and the many rides Theres also a outdoor extension to Magic land Very decent rides there; I played the bungee and gyro drop Queue was manageable except for the few games that everyone garners for Atlantis at Magic land looks like the most popular and Aeronauts hot air balloon and flume ride were also popular Otherwise  we had an enjoyable experience with a day at the park
6159,5,A good place people must visit there is everything from food groceries restaurants electronic audio white goods good quality garments etc etc During the visit I was lucky because there was 50 discount on garments like Zara and others even on sport garments
6160,5,Lotte World is huge with both indoor and outdoor attractions so do plan to spend the whole day there The Fly Venture and Upside down wheel were my favourite rides Stay for the night parade and indoor fireworks  fun for the kids Nice view from the hot air balloon rides
6161,4,the park is old you can see it with some of the rides but well maintained a protion is indoor which is wonderful on a sunny day and there is also a outdoor portion where the more extreme and newer ride is located
6162,3,Within the city With both indoor and outdoor  Its pretty crowded even on weekday  I prefer Everland I like the pretty flowers and decor depending on season  But if you have limited time visit Lotte World
6163,5,Love this shopping mall went during a cold winter u can basically find anything there Parking is pricey Lotte mart i outstanding
6164,5,I bought ticket from Klook for Lotte World Aquarium and Lotte World Adventure both we had an enjoyable experience although the theme park seems already dated as some paints were peeling off but overall it was great  We super enjoyed the photo booths at level 4 of the theme park as it has different themes in each block
6165,3,This theme park has outdoor and indoor area We went there on weekday and it was super packed with the teenager students whose wearing uniform Actually not quite sure how the education system here works But based on my experience not really recommended if you are taking too young kid to this place neither elder due to huge distance also too many floors in the building Its confusing place as they do not provide the map at the outdoor entrance We had to figured out on our own at the end of the day we found the entrance from the mall and the map was there plus no information to inform the tourist if they were busy with a big tour group We were disappointed with the management team here on careless Free WiFi here sucks it doesnt really work mostly unable to connect Ticket will be cheaper in the afternoon but I dont think I want to be back again doesnt worth the money
6166,3,Ok if youre from the US like I am and are used to going to big theme parks like Universal studios six flags and disneyland then youre going to be disappointed If you rarely go to large theme parks then youll like lotte world I really didnt like lotte world because it was so tiny that I could cover the entire amusement park in under 4 hours I dont know about other countries but in America disneyland is so huge that it takes a whole day just to cover one section of the park Compared to the disneyland in LA lotte world is like 110 the size Its just so tiny and the rides were not really thrilling at all The horror house was literally a 10 minute 3D video for 5 year olds If you have young kids then lotte world wouldnt be a bad choice but if youre over 15 years old I suggest everland over lotte world
6167,4,Admittedly Im not sure if we got lucky or whatever but it was a Tuesday There were kids on their field trip there but despite that there were no lines Majority of it is indoors with a train that goes around the indoor area and around the outdoor area too That said it was rather fun and this coming from a guy that doesnt particularly enjoy theme parks Just be aware that the B3 entertainments with the VR and ice skating know that those do NOT come with your entrance so dont be surprised if you need to pay extra for those
6168,5,This place is like Disneyland on steroids It has both rides indoors and out which is great incase it rains  Its also located inside Lotte Mall arguably the greatest mall in existence Theres a Hard Rock Cafe here and many different shops and even exhibits to see Theres even an aquarium  Lotte world itself is great Some of the best and crazies rides Ive ever been on Definitely recommend getting one of their waffle sandwiches waffles cream and fruit sauce I recommend apple located outside near the Drop of Doomtype ride  Great options for food Great for vegetarians and vegans The Panda Express just inside as youre coming in from the outside portion it should be on your right has a tofu stir fry
6169,4,A great day out with kids lots of rides for kids over 120cm and a fair few where you have to be over 150cm The place was rather busy even on a weekday there seems to be a lot of school excursions at the park There were a lot of eateries to choose from and involves a lot of walking so comfortable shoes are recommended They also had a parade happening which was quite exciting to watch and have a big ice skating ring We purchased our tickets online which had to be redeemed from the south gate which was a small walk before we could enter Overall a good day out for kids guess its Seouls answer to Disneyland
6170,4,The indoor amusement park is perfect for those who prefer to stay out of the elements ex Rain cold or heat There were some rides for kids and adults in addition to amusement park snacks The hot balloon ride is only for standing however you get a good view of the entire indoor area The rides were fun and thrilling
6171,4,To be honest I have been to Lotte world many time when I was younger After 6 years visiting again feel like this place is getting old as I am Some of the ride had light upgrade a few new ride but majority of rides are stayed exact same and need some touch up in my opinion  I visit there on Monday expecting little less people than the weekend but there was so many people  so each ride takes long waiting of course My kids had enjoyed I am sure but for the price I paid it was so so in my opinion Not the best place for toddler for sure
6172,4,Lotte World is a really wellmade park we went there with our family on a Friday and it really wasnt that crowded compared to other theme parks  We got the 5ride magic pass wristband and I can tell you that it is totally worth it For some of the rides they let us enter from the exit and enter the ride from there  Overall the scenery was ok but some of the rides had a really nice atmosphere to them Dragon shooting and Phahoras Fury were just a few examples of rides that everyone in your family could enjoy 
6173,5,We have spend all the day its fun and big area indoor and outdoor too many cool games it will cast 50000 won for full day 
6174,5,Great place to shop Theres a big duty free shop inside which is spacious and lots of things Worth a visit if u need duty free products
6175,5,Fantastic quality and service excellent food and great staff at super modern complex with indoor and outdoor options
6176,4,We went there during light snow fall so most of the outside rides were closed The inside area was a bit small but was still fun
6177,5,The best themed Park in the city The best thing is that you have indoors and outdoors activities as well as attractions for all the family
6178,3,This was part of my tour visit to Lotte world  theres a indoor and outdoor theme park  shopping mall  we spend around 23 hours here  The theme park have been operating for some years now  Its a big run down
6179,4,The park has both indoor and outdoor areas Most of the ride inside are for kids We went out for a while but it rained not long after so we werent able to explore  We did enjoy their magic show  The food inside the park are affordable and the taste of the ones we ordered were okay We tried 3 restaurants lunch afternoon snack and early dinner
6180,5,Great for the whole family Its great to visit during winter because the whole area is enclosed so it is warm inside Its have every activity for every age group They even have a Folk Museum that every one should visit to feel History
6181,2,If youre planning to go to Lotte World i suggest you not unless youre going for the kids ride only This place is suuuuper crowded even on a Monday So crowded and most rides would cost you minimum 1 hour to 2 hours max waiting in queue  I went there around 10am and i was only able to play 1 ride and that 1 ride had me waited 2 hours in queue Yes it was a fun ride but will i go for another ride and wait for hours Hell no  And the Magic Pass app is a useless app cant reserve any rides at all Wasted my hald day there
6182,3,As a foreigner you can get very cheap tickets from Trip Advisor Klook etc We got some from Govoyagin for 28000 The problem we found was that it didnt include the three Magic Passes which enables you to skip the queue using either an app or the vending machine outside the ride Going on Lunar New Year Eve it was particularly crowded and most of our time was spent in queues There was even a hot air balloon ride inside much like a Ferris wheel really which had a queue of 100 mins In sum it was interesting cute had some cool VR rides did the three Wild ones but it was an exhausting day PS Skip the haunted mansion Wasnt worth the extra 6000 won
6183,4,If you want to see and indooe park this is really cute If ypu have children they will love to go to this place Have a really beutiful parade at night during the cold weather Have a reallu cute park for toddlers and they have theynown rides in really cute I did it at night because i want to take some pictures but not to ride in any attractions It have an out door island that have rides for adults a lot of really great food It has restaurants too Theprice of the entres depends of what time you go too If you go really late at night is cheaper but you have a of less time in it
6184,3,The place is very nice to travel with the familyWe went there is weekend and it was very crowded Next time we are thing to ho in week days
6185,3,This place as fun but the inside portion is mostly for children Also there are some rides that are not included pass you would have to pay extra There is a lot to do and see inside There is a food court there and several stands to get snacks The outside portion has some rides but not a lot The lines were extremely long If you go near halloween be prepared for zombies to chase you around
6186,4,Lotte world is a half indoor half outdoor amusement park This is extremely convenient when the temperature goes below 0 Lots of activities are proposed for kids of all ages During weekend and special days it gets easily crowded and lines can become very long
6187,5,Very big entertaining center in Seoul South Korea It was a good trip to spend a whole day in Lotte world
6188,4,This place is huge Filled with anything you name it Shopping cinemas restaurants themepark jogging park lake you name it  But parking is very expensive Still worth a visit
6189,5,If you like amusement parks or want to give your kids a treat and live in Seoul or stay there for many days I can recommend it as a daytrip Its fun  some attractions have a hight restriction Go there with subway if you can as this is very convenient
6190,4,Ive been to this place with my family My children really enjoy it The fly Adventure made them feel very exited Other game like roller coaster and skate are very good The food is nice and many choices Really had fun there
6191,3,Traffic took almost 3 hours from Junggu and the lines for rides inside Lotte World were more than 60 minutes Navigation for our senior family member was not smooth sailing as the elevator was always full and only stsirs from basement to ground The place has a lot to offer but the shouldertoshoulder guests made it difficult to enjoy during December holidays
6192,5,Couldnt have planned for a better day in the midst of cold February Kids were happy and smiled all day Its super easy to find with public transport caters for kids especially younger ones There is god stalls everywhere and its next to the aquarium and shopping centre which can help round off the whole day
6193,1,Too Long queueing  not worthy for couple One day pass not worth it During winters out door park are closed
6194,3,Lotte Adventure World is a haven for parents with kids 12 and below as everything there is made for the little ones It is a onestopshop and playground for parents who dont hv to fret about children being bored However the queue to every ride takes about 6070minutes For those with toddlers the queues are shorter in the section for tiny tots The services offered to parents are ample It is a brightlylit place with lots of colour but for teens n adults the surging crowds and noise level there can grate on your nerves
6195,4,It was winter when we visited and the indoor theme park is a haven of children and parents Its warm and welcoming and a lot of fun Also the fact that full house taped a few moment of their episode here is a bonus
6196,2,Visited on a day that was pouring with rain with the hopes that the worlds apparently largest indoor themepark would have something to offer Even for a Monday the place was packed To make it worse the outdoor attractions shut down in the rain making indoors even more crowded There were threehour queues snaking around the park If youre used to the likes of Universal Studios I would say to give Lotte World a miss if youre only in Seoul for a week
6197,3,Wasnt a very good experience as I came in winter Most of the rides were closed so the remaining rides that are opened had very long queues I took a total of 2 rides in the entire afternoon with a one and half hour queue time each  However what Ive observed is that itll be a great place for kids in winter Lots of kiddy rides thats indoor away from the harsh winter air  Will recommend coming in other seasons
6198,5,After we prebooked our tickets our I worried myself a bit after reading some poor reviews but we had lots of fun Lots of teenschildren but we are both in our late 20s and still had a great day Dont spend money on the mini zoo the animals are so poorly looked after and be aware that some things will cost extra We arrived early on a wet overcast day which seemed to help as we had little to no wait time on most rides As the day went on we could see wait times were massively increasing so would strongly recommend going early Check out the folk museum and dont forget to get a park map as many rides are upstairs downstairs or outside
6199,5,We are 5 pax bought our tickets from Klook RM100 per pax There is an indoor and an outdoor theme park The outdoor has more thrilling rides and the indoor has more kiddy rides The have the largest indoor theme park in the world The indoor theme park has multiple levels Be ready to spend a whole fun day there
6200,5,The rides are awesome here and all the decors are really fancy Avoid visiting on weekends since there will be longer lines for the rides Restaurants are slightly overpriced but has good quality You can also bring your lunchbox in theres a separate terraceeating place Check on their website before visiting they offer lots of benefits and coupons
6201,4,We went on a weekday which happen to fall on a day when many of the schools brought their kids so the lines were a bit long for the bigger rides There are a variety of different roller coasters crazy spin you upside down rides just cruising slow paced rides 3D attractions A HAUNTED HOUSE really liked this one and lots of fun rides for the kids They also had a parade at night which was pretty interesting This place is pretty big so I would suggest making good use of the map and pick the places you would like to try and check out I would also recommend checking different sites for tickets on sale I went with my sisters  friends and what made this place fun was being able to hang out with friends enjoy different attractions together The customer service was pretty good and friendly for the most part Kids would have fun for sure but going with friends as adults is fun as well
6202,2,if your kid is 5 or less stay inside There are things to do on the 1st floor besides the Carousel We didnt find this area until later so we wasted time outside Outside rides are for older kids except for 2 rides which were boringshort The boat ride was fun but its too cold in oct to winter I think if I had to do it again I would skip this if you have a toddler and go elsewhere
6203,1,Such a disappointing park If everland is a stripped down version of disneyland this is a stripped down version of everland in a shopping mall  If you have to choose between everland and lotte world dont choose here
6204,4,Very large shopping mall You wikl find all you need over there Especially all the famous international brands
6205,5,This park is so much fun My friend and I went for the day were both in our 30s and we had a blast The rides are a lot of fun I was so impressed that a lot of the rides are indoors Its a mustsee for any age
6206,4,The big draw for this place in Korea is that it is partially indoors There is a very expensive shooting range here too The lines for the rides are usually really long
6207,3,It was a fun place When you have extra time you can go there It is not as spectacular as Universal Studios or Disneyland but it could do Nothing much to say They have indoor and outdoor area a few rides Thats it
6208,5,It may be packed loud the ticket may be a bit expensive but this is fun Great place to get loose and just relax and ride the gyro and all other crazy trains machines boats Feel like a kid again go there to have a great time and just take it easy and have a great day
6209,4,I went during the summer when school was off so there was quite a lot of people But the best thing was the magic passes Even though some of the lines were long by planning ahead I was able to rid on quite a number of attractions before the end of the day One downside was the hot weather So be careful if you go during the summer
6210,1,Even though you have premium pass and almost reach on time you can feel stubborn and arrogant service from young crews
6211,5,This place is a peace of heaven  the view is good  its safe  the building itself contains a big shopping center  its so close to so many places and the heart of seuol
6212,4,The downside was just it was overcrowded Maybe its just because we went at a busy day Overall its all good
6213,4,We only spent few hours in there in the evening maybe it was because the Halloween theme plus national holiday Lotte world was over crowded However it is a magnificent place and really good fun for children Worth visiting for sure
6214,4,Went to this place on a holiday expecting it to be somewhat slow It was busy Many good rides but the cues for the roller coasters were too long The rides I do ride were very fun and had an almost Disney level of quality to the attractions The food was also very good I ate way too much My only disappointment was TGIFridays on the 1st floor ground floor
6215,4,There are many rides that are better than expected and several that are just terrible This is a very unique amusement park design and feels huge inside Highlights include the Atlantis roller coaster outside Pharaohs Furry the night Lets Dream parade and the free Korea cultural museum
6216,4,We didnt go inside the Lotte World Anyway there is a beautiful lake walk around You can admire the worlds 5 highest building from different angles and even go into the top at extra cost
6217,3,Bring the children here n they will love it All the cute things in the park is so colorful Nice for picture
6218,4,Very popular with local people Connected with Lotte hotel and shopping complex Can easily spend a day in this area
6219,5,Not as big scale as compared to everland but filled with a lot of fun activities The queue was quite terrible when I went there on a monday Located in the city and thus very accessible for tourists planning to travel seoul only Bonus lotte mart and departmental store are just right outside and you may want to buy things there after spending a day in lotte world
6220,5,My 7 years old daughter loved the place so much especially the pororo house Lotte world is a very good place not only for children but adults as well you have so many things to do inside Its worth the money spent Well definitely visit again next time
6221,3,I read so many good reviews about this place so I had big expectations Well it didnt meet them Dont get me wrong park is nice and have some good rides but nothing impressive There is for sure better adventure parks like Six Flags or Disney World Food inside is very cheap so thats good As a tip go after 4pm because they have a special rate and also rides are less busier Park closes at 11pm so you will have enough time to do some rides
6222,5,A lot of rides for the children There is an indoor park and an outdoor park The outdoor park looks fun with exciting rides but we didnt manage to take rides as it was raining  However there was plenty to do indoors The rides are based according to heights We went during off peak so the queues were not too long There is also an evening  It is easy to go there using public transport just that you need to walk to bit from the subway to the Lotte World
6223,5,No need to explain Kids and Theme parks A day is not enough to explore and enjoy Go there early and spend the whole day to get the maximum out of your ticket
6224,3,We are not huge Disneyland people but this was a fun adventure More of a kid and teen activity but ok for adults Pretty pricey about 30USperson but if youre into rides and games its fun especially at night They even have an Electric Light Parade just like Disney
6225,4,I reserved a whole day for Lotte World and spent a fun day here with my friends There were both indoors and outdoors for the theme park so you will be able to enjoy the rides even it is raining There are more activities suitable for children indoors compared to outdoors as there are mainly rides for the outdoor part It wasnt too expensive to have food inside I recommend you to come here if you have a spare day in Seoul
6226,5,We booked a ticket on the internet and saved a good amount The theme park is absolutely amazing Rides are a combination of adrenaline and smooth The overall park is a Disney style theme a must for families  I didnt think the park looked old at all Very well organised and definitely value for money You will have a very good time This is coming from someone who has three world class theme parks in their city
6227,1,We visited the Lotte World amusement park expecting a Disneylike experience The park is expensive and underwhelming
6228,4,Our teenage doughters loved Lotte World A large part is indoor so very good for rainy days During summer and weekends its very busy so you might avoid those times
6229,3,It is a littleold BUT we went during the week and the wait times were barely anything Not a whole lot for our 4 year old She was even too short for some of the kid rides Go figure Not a bad day
6230,4,Checked out Lotte World the mall theme park and building The mall was a mall no surprise there Some upscale stores as well as the usual mall type stores Decent food court The view at the top of Lotte World Tower was really nice and not too expensive Glass floors make it funinteresting The theme park has a little for everyone Food rides and plenty of entertainment Definitely worth a visit if you are there for a weekend
6231,4,If you like amusement park this place can be a good option Ive been here three times On the weekend it is super busy Lines will be so long The longest time I waited in the line was 2 hours
6232,4,Nice view from top of the tower Multiple option of restaurant at the top There is observation deck on chargeable basis to enjoy the view or choose to eat out at any eating place to have a good view
6233,4,Very nice theme park had fun riding their amazing rides they have restaurants inside too kids and adults will love it here
6234,5,Spent my birthday this year here with my husband and two young boys and it ended up being such a fun day The boys were excited from the moment we entered It was indoors so it was perfect during the rainy weather We went on a Friday and there were not that many people so the lines for the rides were not bad at all I cant imagine how the lines would be on a weekend Everything was cute and catered for kids There were adult rides as well but we didnt go on them There are lots of places to get food and we ended up eating at their fancy Italian restaurant for lunch to celebrate The food was delicious and price was not too bad At the top floor they have this area like the Alive Museum which was fun for everyone The place was not too big so it wasnt overwhelming like Disneyland or Disneyworld I thought it was just the right size for a one day visit We got combo tickets for the Lotte World and the Lotte Aquarium from Klook which was a great deal
6235,4,We took the train to Jamsil station and walked to Lotte World We went on a weekday so not so crowded I bought the tickets online so its cheaper but still need to go to the counter to exchange for the tickets Indoor is more for younger children while outdoor is more for the adults as the rides are more thrilling Its quite fun think most children will like it
6236,5,Lots to do Massive shopping center Loads of restaurants and cafes Lots of shops too Very entertaining  get ready to walk loads
6237,5,We just came to window shop and my wife checked all the designers store All the beauty products under the sun is here plus more Duty free shopping is also available here very convenient for foreigners to shop The food section is unbelievable anything you want is available both local and imported items The quality and availability of food items in this market surpassed the US supermarkets
6238,5,I went with family a week ago I visited many theme parks in the world including Disney world Lotte world is a way and much much better than any theme park It is like a dream land to kids If you are going to Seoul never ever miss this place
6239,2,This place have everything Every type of rides you can find at Disneyuniversal studios you can find it hereBut a Ripoff version of everything Do not set your expectation too high and you will not be disappointed The place is well maintained and food options are aplenty
6240,4,Dont expect a Disneyland kind of experience but with the right mindset this can be a fun place Dont pay full price there a discount coupons all over Seoul and if you visit after 4pm you pay a reduced price combined with a discount coupon the entrance fee is reduced by almost 50 The place is open till 10pm so you have lots of time to explore Most of the rides is standard carnival stuff but they also have a couple of rides which are brave attempts to copy Disney They do not succeed but it is all very charming and we laughed about it Staff is for the most part friendly Stay till 8pm for the excellent light parade
6241,3,The day i was there it was raining so Only half of the attractions were open  Inside is pretty filled to the brim with rides but its mostly for little kids Id say middle school at the oldest Lot of 4Dish rides  For the price you could do worse
6242,3,For a midlifer I found this place as just okay Just to while your time Good thing we went here at around 7pm where the entrance fee is much cheaper If you have been to Disneyland Universal Studios and Ocean Park and you just want to visit and not take the rides then go at 7pm
6243,3,1 hour from central this indoor  outdoor park is big with many rides whether you visit in weekend or weekdays it is extremely over crowded with locals you have to wait 3060 minutes for most of the rides we have spent 56 hours and hardly enjoyed 78 rides we have spent whole day standing from one queue to another You have to pay money for many rides and many rides are boring and mostly for kids so not worth standing in queue for long time few restaurants inside
6244,5,We started early morning so we had the chance to enter each game twice its amazing on weekdays so you can avoid the crowd many restaurants amazing hourly parades fare prices we finished by 9 pm my kids fell asleep without bedtime arguments its a must on every Seoul visit
6245,3,Theme park is more suitable for children may be up to 11 years old and the facility inside looks pretty old
6246,5,Lotte World is really famous place in Korea Also it is nice place to come with kids Every kids would like Lotte World because there are many costumes and there are a lots of rides The best thing was when you pay with MasterCard we can get a 25 discount
6247,3,Good attraction to visit Many games and rides available for different rages for ages Easy to reach by metro or taxi or buss  Verity of Resturants around   Recommend place to visit 
6248,3,Dont expect the international service here if you used to visit Disneyland or universal studio or intentional theme park else where This is the lower standard than you expect Staffs is not friendly They are dead like they are forcing to work here 1 out of 10 scores for the service mind 2 out of 10 scores for the helpful service And staff here dont speak English And they ignore you sometime with the dead face  Some of the rides look interesting but you have to pay more for example VR zone
6249,5,Lottemart Seoul where I go is in the Seoul station Just go insideupstairs and turn right You can see huge lottemart with lots of goods thereyou can try many tester therefoodfruit snacks etc
6250,5,great experience in Lotte World Adventure and Aquarium one of the most memorable trip of my life 
6251,5,I am 7 years old and it was a fun time there And I get to go on every rollercoaster except the one outside I was too small for it Vr rollercoaster was the best The queues were very very Long but not as Long as some places like universal studios in Singapore The indoor part was the best coz it was cool not hot and we went early so going on rides was easy The tomb of horror was horrible I was so scared my daddy had to carry me just like a little baby Now Im done
6252,4,on the weekend or national holiday will be so crowd some popular ride air balloon need a very long waiting time but overall I am satisfied for Muslim they provide prayer room it is clean and well arranged
6253,4,I often bring my friends to this place If youve never visited this place it is worth visit It is very convenient to visit with transportation and lots of attractions to ride Also some VR activities recently added are very interesting If you pay with Mastercard you can have 20 discount on ticket so price is affordable I think  
6254,1,This place is super crowded i went here last february with my friends and we were not able to ride any rides This place is full of kids and locals and i think some has their field trips that day Few rides and a bit old or overused i think they need renovation Well i think this amusement park is for kids for teenanagers better go to Everland 
6255,3,We went there as 3 families with young children aged from 2 to 8 We had deliberately avoid the weekend and went on a Mon but Lotte world was very crowded My girl aged 8 wanted to try the roller coaster etc but the average waiting time is more than 1 hour Even for the hot air balloon we had to queue for 60 minutes which I feel that it is not worth the wait Most of the time was spent waiting hence it was rather annoying for us  I understand that there is an app which allows us to book the timing in advance but it is not working that well Though it mentioned that the next booking timing but whenever the booking is opened the app will hang and by the time it recovers the booking is closed again  However 1 plus point is that it is air conditioned hence not as hot as other theme parks We did not have enough time to explore the portion outside though we understand there are 2 portions to it  For the younger kids I think they enjoyed the magic show
6256,4,This is one of the famous amusement park in Korea esp in Seoul It has both outdoor and indoor attraction I really enjoyed playing in here even one day was not enough They has full of wifi area everywhere and I needed it so much that time  they offered an application on phone for us so that we dont need to queueing up for long time in every attraction but unfortunately there were some attraction that didnt work when I went there but I want to go there again next time
6257,5,Nice department store and mostly chain with differwnt brands to buy depending on the money you put 
6258,5,My kids really like everything there 5th grader and 2nd grader had a blast They want to go back there for sure
6259,1,Too crowd and long lines but nothing to enjoy  If you want to waste time and money this is the proper place
6260,3,If you have children and are at a loss of ideas on where to go Lotte World would provide your kids with hours of fun From Myeongdong it takes less than an hour to travel to Jamsil station which is directly connected to the park Its a huge place with indoor and outdoor area For those who want to escape from the summer heat will enjoy the fact that there are also many attractions in the indoor area The rides are okay but some of the 3D shorting games was a tad disappointing Avoid weekends and public holidays We went on a weekday morning so it was relatively sane We didnt need to wait long for the rides By afternoon we se hordes of school kids there for their school trip Time to leave It was a fun experience but not so impressive enough for me to want to visit again Then again Im not really into amusement Parks
6261,3,The rides are quite ordinary there is long queues due to tour organiser there is not a whole lot you can do the good point is its indoor so the kids can still have fun in a cool air condition area
6262,5,Good to shop here cuz there are plenty kinds of food cosmetics accessories and so on Especially very cheap
6263,3,SO this place is super over crowded unless you go over on a weekday then its not so bad I dont suggest going to this place on a weekend since its insane to travel there There are good options of food and restaurants there too but overall its a mediocre theme park meant for little children and big baby adults Its not 6 Flags but it was okay I highly suggest Everland than this place since the rides do get boring and there are English speaking help but going there once is pretty much enough unless you wanna check out the out door park cause thats somewhat fun
6264,3,It is a indoor and outdoor park  with rides food food and a mall It costs around 40 for a pone day pass but for some attraction you will need to pay more It did not make sense since we did choose the all day pass with inclusive of attraction The queue are long about 1h30 We went on a week day non holiday period
6265,5,Is not cheap 27000 wons to get to the last floor but you will have imppressive view over Seoul from 500m above
6266,4,This store competes easily with the large high end stores of Europe and the US UK Food stalls and grocery in the basement are alone worth a visit Wonderful designer shops within the store offering stylish high end shopping
6267,5,usually amusement parks in Seoul are outside of the city so this place is great to visit which is easily accessible by public transportation and ever much entertaining
6268,4,Lotte World is your world to amuse with all kinds of fun I was impressed with the ghost house I dont remember the name they made it so real that some of my friends were frozen
6269,5,Lotte world is huge I went on a Friday and spent an entire day there Despite it being a weekday the place was super crowded On average I think I spent about 1 and a half hour queuing for each ride The queues can be quite painful but the rides were well worth the queue I would suggest reaching Lotte World the moment it opens and going straight for the few rides you really want to go for first Because the waiting times for some of the more exciting rides become 2 and a half hours later in the afternoon There are many restaurants in the theme park too and they are surprisingly not expensive Also weather is not really an issue since most of the rides are indoors Overall I had a great day there But it was really tiring to queue though
6270,1,If I could give it minus one star I would Wait for rides are massive 140 minutes at 2pm in school time for one of the less popular rides Overpriced overcrowded  left me feeling underwhelmed and under appreciated as a paying customer Would rather have paid best part of 40 pounds for someone to slap me in the face with a wet fish At least cost wise it would have been better value than this complete rip off  Dont bother with the App to reserve rides  doesnt work Hardly a surprise
6271,4,Not as many exillerating rides as many of the outside parks have to offer and we experienced really long lines however it is very much worth a visit and we had a blast A rollercoater ride inside is pretty hair raising Try find foreigner discount days if youre a visitor it can make a big difference price wise
6272,4,The place is impressive we can not argue about it But it is really really crowded Its basically covered with people they are everywhere Long long long lines I have waited for 2 hours for a 7 minuted ride Download application and try not to go crazy
6273,1,I happened to wind up going there on a day when all the schools decided to have their outing on the same day I ended up asking for a refund after about 45 minutes I was told the queue for the roller Coaster outside was 3 hours long Everything else inside looked really long too  The inside section of the park needs some serious updating Didnt go to Everland the week I went as a result of finding out how bogged down with people this place gets  As I left in the late afternoon the queue was much worse There really should be a cap to the number of people they let come into this place  And whatever yo do absolutely avoid any holidays Especially the first week in May
6274,1,Too many people No opportunity No management Evenat least you should wait for 100min to enter the Ghost House Here will be the worst experience of yours
6275,3,Maybe cos we went on Xmas eve too crowded and end up didnt manage to take many rides perhaps only 4 at most Our boys from 7yo to 16yo were disappointed Everland was better
6276,2,If you want to visit a crowded department store to spend thousands of dollars on over priced designer labels go for it I walked through as a curiosity to see what kind of person would pay enormous amounts of money for clothes and accessories made in China but stamped with some designer name I can afford it but would never spend thousands on a purse or shirt
6277,4,Never pay full price for entry tickets if youre a foreigner There are a number of ways to get cheaper entrance tickets and we used Funtastic Korea voucher received 45 discount Despite it saying need 12 days before getting a confirmation email I received this within 10 minutes just ensure bookings are open on the day you want to visit Follow the entry instructions and make sure you take the passport in which the voucher was registered  Lotte World itself is crazy busy at any time Suggest you get there as early as you can Queues can be lengthy Download the Lotte World app to receive three magic passes for quicker entry to your selected rides though wait times can still be more than two hours  The five year old loved his age appropriate rides Yes there is a height restriction and as long as above 110cm then they are allowed on most of the kiddy rides They measure you pretty much at each ride there are a few allowing 90cm
6278,3,Amusement park means you come here to play not to spend time waitingI think administration could use newer technologies to manage visitors Id prefer go to openair Ocean or Everland parks but theyare outside of Seoul and weve decided to go to the Lotter World Not an optimal choice to spend your time with kids And mobile app is a garbage it shows wrong waiting time
6279,4,We went to Lotte World on our last day of our holiday Due to the rainy weather we were stayed at the indoor theme park This is great for all ages especially for familys We took the subway to get to Lotte World
6280,5,We went to this theme park as Everland is a bit far and were not disappointed with what was on offered We spent the whole day there and only left when the park was closed Our children love it We took quite a few photo of Cherry Blossom that lined up the park Memorable experience We would recommend it to anyone
6281,3,Kind of wonderland When i was there i thought I went to future  all games and entertainments was by using VR virtual reality devices in some points it was interesting but when you think deeply there were no real activity most of the items were virtual  very few real things
6282,3,I had fun with my friends here The lines were much too long and my friends didnt know what they were doing but it was still really cool being here The food is crazy expensive We had to search for forever to find the one ice cream shop that was more reasonably priced because it was EXTREMELY hot seeing that it was summer Its half inside and half outside so that part was super cool It was my first time seeing an amusement park inside We ended up finding the ice cream shop Since its half inside you could go on a rainy day but I would suggest going when you can enjoy both parts of the park There are many rides that are copies of Disneyland so I would compare it to that Not very thrilling but everything was very cute Couples everywhere Mustgoto if you love amusement parks We ate at the Lotteria outside before going into the park
6283,4,Our first stop is this theme park It nice indoor theme park Enjoyed roaming around this place Ride the giant loop also then the horror house Then going around the place
6284,4,West Edmonton Mall eat your heart out give or take 800 shops and a kids entertainment centre They have a shop for anything you can think of If you love shopping this is a must see
6285,5,I highly recommend to visit this place in the morning since youll likely spend about the whole day in there Theres a lot to see and a great number of attractions youll want to try Definitely try the Mickymouse waffles outside the main building they are delicious
6286,4,This is one huge mall with plenty of American brand name stores and lots of restaurants It has a great cinema and plenty of space to sit and to explore I am travelling solo but being a father of 2 children it was nice seeing a large section dedicated to children
6287,5,Didnt get in the Lotte World theme park just went to Team Lab which is the digital art exhibition area inside Lotte World It is a separate unit The ticket price is fair  There are awesome interactive digital art display suitable for all age range Highly recommended
6288,5,Easy to get to at Jamsil station Book online like FuntasticKorea etc to get discount but book 2 days early Lotte world is great value with many things to do kids and teenagers at Magic Island Its welllaid out and split between 7 floors b3 to 4fso spend a day here
6289,4,Great place for family to have fun and spend time What I liked and made it a pleasant place is that they have a halal restaurant and a prayer room
6290,4,A very good park The entrance for one day is 53k won The place is big with lots of games Indoor and outdoors games Some games still u have to pay even with entrance fee The staff are very helpful and friendly  Highly recommend it
6291,5,Kids enjoy e rides Its like disney land Very super cold wen its nite Kids love them as have indoor m outdoor gamesrides lotte world is very suitable for young children
6292,5,We told our daughters wed take them to Lotte world on the last day of our Korea holiday as a reward for all the siteseeing wed chosen to take them to I wasnt expecting it to be all that good but it was actually a fantastic theme park Its mostly indoors and there are some really fun rides even for adults There are some inside rides that are extremely fast and upside down and it is a really fun atmosphere we would definitely go back next time in seoul
6293,4,This is one of the place you need to visit when you are in Korea it has a lot of rides dedicated to all kind of ages However a great tip to avoid long queues and crowds is to go there when it is not their school holidays or any kinds of holiday
6294,4,Outdoor and indoor theme park Many things can do there U can reach there with subway and stop at jamsil station exit 3 or 4
6295,5,There were too many rides and attractions but for the best ones lines were too long Unless you buy an M pass to bypass those in line which is a tad too expensive for me Regardless there are still a lot you can ride or experience
6296,4,Not much can be said because its normal just like any other theme park in the world Games are fun and interesting
6297,4,This is an outdoor amusement park with indoor theme park like Disneyland  The indoor theme park has a few 3D shows which are very exciting not to be missed  The queue for the rides in the outdoor park was quite long and we waited for an average of 45 minutes for the rides  Be prepared to spend a day here as there are many fun things to do here
6298,5,Very recommended for a family with young children baby and also teenagers Since it separate to outdoor and indoor game activities for young children and baby the most suitable games is indoor I also took my lunch at the restaurant in indoor games forgot the name since there are many of food kiosk in there
6299,4,Great place to have fun with friends can spend a whole day there There is stuff for everyone to enjoy Very easy to get to from the subway station which is right underground
6300,5,This is great for the family to visit the food is really good and the rides are fitting for everyone Half of the park is inside and half is outside which I really liked because if you get hot outside you can go inside and ride some rides
6301,3,As with all theme parks its best to go early My sister and I arrived around 11 and spent a bulk of our time queuing for rides Go early and run STRAIGHT to the French Revolution rollercoaster The queue there was TWO HOURS LONG  The indoor theme park is likely to appeal more to younger children with animal mascots and princessdinosaur parades
6302,5,this park is humanfriendly and lots of fun to explore nice place for a family to spend a whole day at unlike the US theme park you may well want to go again and again even you know those cartoon characters
6303,3,Went with my elderly mum Just to have a look at what exactly is attractive to all the young people Typical indoor theme park We didnt really go outdoor as it was really cold in winter  However most people who visited lotte world would just take all the throat yelling rides and didnt realized that there is actually a folk museum inside There is a miniature of the palace inside Well at least my elderly mum was happy with it
6304,3,Magic pass is the key to avoid long queues Get the apps in your phone and scan your ticket to ensure smooth entry Highly recommended for free entry Fly Venture Muslim tourists need not worry about halal food Pasha kebab available in the park
6305,4,Make sure to go during the offpeak period to avoid long queues for rides We managed to take quite many rides and repeated ones as it was not KR school holidays yet I am surprised with the quality of food was good at Lotte World although slightly pricey but really quite alright Do not pitch it against Disney not quite the same  but good enough It will take you one full day  so make sure you have the time
6306,5,If you are going to Seoul during winter then you must go here The place is nice It is located inside the mall The outdoor activities and view is at par with that of disneyland and universal studios
6307,5,In the middle of nouveau rich part of Seoul there is an American dream themed skating ring As in my 20s after another boring or unhappy week at work I went to this skating ring to unwind It reminded me of happy times at younger ages when there were still hopes  dreams Living in Seoul can be a crowded or monotonous experience for some but this place can help one forget everything for a while Pretty  one can go back to childhood dreams in Seoul
6308,5,When we were in Seoul it was freezing cold so staying indoor was the only option for us Lotte World has indoor facilities and these facilities were enough to entertain little kids We stayed there longer than we had expected and had a wonderful memory there
6309,2,Dont get me wrong this theme park looks perfectly fun with all the thrilling rides being outdoor But the Q was like super long more than 90 mins wait for the rides its a waste of time and money to be there
6310,5,A very nice attraction specially for kids and kids at heart who wants to enjoy a modern carnivallike atmosphere Consists of many fun and exciting rides for all types of ages
6311,3,Good Attraction but you need to rethink about your trip plan  This is my 2nd time visiting Lotte World bought the discount ticket 30 off from Trip Maker through my guesthouse and I went there on Saturday and omg that was a disaster Arrived there at 11am and left at 8pm 7 hours I have spent almost 4  5 hours ONLY lining up and looked at my phone   No doubt the rides and everythings are cool and entertaining in the Lotte World both indoor and outdoor but there are sooooo many people; For the most famous rides like Gyro Spin and Atlantis I have spent 45 mins queuing for each lel  I dont think I need to describe how fun it is in the theme park since they are more or less the same seriously yeah Lotte World makes you feel joyful and excited when you step in the indoor park but for real when you get closer to the ride and once you spot the end of the queue and start lining up and wait for 15 mins and wait for 30 mins still a long way to go I am sure you will get mad I was with my boyfriend and we were getting more tired and even stopped talking  I strongly suggest my fellow travellers try to avoid visit Lotte World on FridaySaturdaySunday  My first visit to Lotte World back in 2014 I paid fullprice and only spent 4 hours there becasue I was so fed up with the queuing Thought it would be better for my revisit after 2 years still the samesmh
6312,4,Yes from branded to local stuff You can get everything you in the place There is a supermarket even called Lotte Mart next door
6313,3,The highlight of this park is that its inside It was nice to get out of the cold temperatures but the lines for all of the attractions were so long that we only made it on 4 rides the whole day If you can find a time when its less busy Im sure it would be more fun
6314,5,Lotte world is the indoor amusement and outdoor also You can going by metro and stop at Jamsil It is closer than everland if you stay in Seoul
6315,4,This theme park is combination outdoor and indoor suitable for all ages and many type snacks inside the theme park
6316,4,Lots to do and the tickets are good value However the queues were simply horrendous Average of 90 minutes to 2 hours for each ride We downloaded the app to book rides according to time slots but there was an online queue too My kid did enjoy it and the balloon rides over the whole park is great for young children
6317,2,We came here early just after it opened and there was already ques for 60minthere are signs which tell you approx waiting time So we though we would go on a few other rides and the ques would get shorter Big mistake by lunchtime there were lines for 120min then a few hours later they reached 170min You cant leave the park once you are in and the lunch area was so busy that we had trouble finding a seat and it was just the two of us Cant imagine bringing a family with kids We ended up waiting in some lines and did enjoy the rides we did go on I wouldnt recomend though
6318,4,This is the 2nd time visiting so not much excitement There are indoor and outdoor theme parks Went on weekend the place was packed with local and foreigners The popular rides are 2 hour queue There are many food outlets where you can have your meals Spend a whole day here to get your money worth The parade at 8 pm Is nearer than Everland if you dont have time in Seoul
6319,4,Its definitely somewhere to go if you have some spare time in Seoul The rides are not the best and the cues are big but its a good laugh specially to see how cute everything is
6320,3,Conveniently situated near Jamsil Station it has both indoor and outdoor theme park The queues were quite long and you will need to queue more than an hour for popular rides The Cinderella performance for Christmas season was fantastic; beautiful costumes and dance routines There is plenty of shopping choices and restaurants right outside the theme park as well  If you are not a fan of rides and do not have patience for queuing then I suggest you give this place a miss
6321,4,This is great amusement park because it has an indoors and outdoors area I felt that I was in a mall amusement park and a city fair all at the same time I could have spent a whole day at Lotte World The best part about visiting this place was the Answer Me 1988 exhibit It has a lot of curious memorabilias about the show that I was really grateful to see
6322,4,We took my 15 year old daughter here when she was 14 when we visited Korea for the first time My husband and her had a great time going on all of the rides together While I on the other hand had a great time spending the day in the culture museum that they had there There were long line on the most popular rides but because we went during the MERS scare the lines were pretty short anywhere else I would advise going when the kids in Korea are in school because the lines are shorter It has an indoor and outdoor part of the park Both parts were very fun There is a small alive museum in the park where you can take fun pictures that are optical illusions  The great thing about the park is that there is public transportation that can get you straight to the entrance of the park I wish that there were more people who spoke English there But there were plenty of signs in English too We had a great experience going and would definitely go back sometime
6323,3,Found the theme park just ordinary Personally find Disney better off than Lotte World  As I came during winter time Christmas holiday the queue was long and the outdoor activity was closed  Appreciated more if there are more person in charge could speak English or put more sign in English Otherwise it would be a bit trouble some for us who does not speak local language  TK
6324,4,Love this place especially when visited the theme park during Christmas season The musical parade and fireworks is way too awesome
6325,5,As my children were very young and they dont really enjoy rides we decided to only go to Pororo Park which is located on level B3 of Lotte world For 2 young children and 1 adult it cost KRW50000 for 2 hours The place was clean and the staff were all very sensitive to the children and their wellbeing My kids enjoyed themselves and i would visit again if i were to travel to Seoul
6326,3,Nothing special Too pricey Too long a queue for the games wasting time waiting for the ride etc Magic island is probably better with more scenic views
6327,4,Our children totally enjoyed our 6 hours stay there Advice to buy express queue to save time  Was informed that we can enjoy all rides at the park however some of the rides need additional entrance fee
6328,2,This place really is incredible to view The design and overall appearance of the precinct is nearly breathtaking It is a shame however that unless youre willing to stand in lines of at least an hour you cant really do much Any of the attractions that are really worth going on are minimum hour sometimes significantly more The locals didnt seem to mind and perhaps thats a cultural thing but lining up for an hour then having a five minute ride only to line up for another hour wore thin very quickly I could only imagine it with a couple of kids although again no local kids seemed to mind from what I could tell Steep entry fee but it probably is worth a look just to actually view the place
6329,4,We went to Lotte World last Dec 24 As expected there were long lines before you can take the ride Waiting time is around 60 minutes for a 5 minute ride There are attractions that you have to pay extra even if you get an all day pass My 9 year old son was able to get in 5 attractions because of the long queue He decided to do ice skate instead
6330,5,Not many rides that can be played by children aged under 4 years Each game will have to be dealt size But easy to get here by public transport However we enjoy our day here
6331,3,As per all other amusement parks the rides are all having very long queue and you need to plan to be there early to start queuing for the rides This park is almost exact copy of Disneyland down to the parades But still is a good park in Seoul if you prefer not to travel to Tokyo which is the nearest for the real one The indoor rides are more for the children and the outdoor rides are actually cater for the teenagers and adult alike Adult ticket cost KRW52000 while teenagers age between 13yo to 18yo cost KRW45000
6332,4,We went on a Saturday and started off with the outdoor rides Just 2 rides have already spent 4 hrs queuing Many rides and attractions both indoor and outdoor but the long queue requires lots of patience and self entertainment while queuing Downloaded the Apps for Quickpass but it is useless as it is always full every 15 mins Not recommended for weekend
6333,4,If you have kids go there you will have fun with them If you want to get 20 discount use MasterCard to get the tickets at the door
6334,5,One needs at least a full day to enjoy some of the rides Anything less will simply be  sightseeing and some shoppingGood to explore the museam within and try their authentic local dishes adjacent to the museum
6335,3,The place is crowded even on weekdays  especially in December With an admission ticket all rides need to pay and not that cheap Do check it out if it is your first time in Seoul For me once is enough
6336,3,The theme park is big but is not attractive enough for adult to come for second time And sometime need to queue long
6337,3,My 2nd visit to Lotte World and this time I booked tickets on weekdays hoping itll not be crowded like all theme parks I was wrong the place is bustling with students and young couples even on a Monday The queue for outdoor rides is worst The snake long queue has at least more than 50 pax for each ride   Theres a queue on almost all the rides even the indoor monorail ride Be prepared to wait at least 45 mins for a 5 mins ride Downloaded the fast pass app and its doesnt work The only consolation is that theres a prayer room and halal kebab food in Lotte World
6338,4,We had a late flight on our last day in Seoul and thus we planned to visit Lotte World because it didnt require a private tour guide We hired one for the prior three days to take us around Seoul The park is easily accessible by subway and the station that serves Lotte World is Jamsil station which is on subway lines 2 and 8  I think the park carter to younger kids most rides are familiar and expected to be in a theme park nonetheless the kids still had a great time  The price of food at their food court is reasonable and some taste good indeed Although its an indoor park a small portion of it is outdoor and connected by a bridge all in all its good on very hot or raining or cold weather 
6339,4,We stayed in Seoul for four nights and stayed in the hotel It was excellent quality but a bit pricey  what else to expect from the fast growing city and its largest entertaining company The sauna area was a great experience very peaceful and clean Everything was clean
6340,5,This theme park is very easy to get to  right off the train and a short walk through the mall attached to the entrance There are a few floors inside with different rides around an indoor ice skating rink On the outside there are larger rides There is also a culturalhistory museum  I didnt find the exhibits to be too interesting inside that Its a really fun place to spend a day It was great to have inside areas to escape the cold I really enjoyed my time here  something for all ages rides for everyone and things are not spaced out to the point where it is a struggle to get around inside the theme park
6341,4,Just like any theme park be prepared to wait in queue Popular with locals and tourists Could spend up to a day at this place Some outdoor rides are more suitable for teenagers
6342,5,a lot of funs here suitable for all family couples and all age ranges will visit again love it
6343,4,When entering from the Mall I thought at first it would be a small console type operation To my complete surprise it was an amazing experience with a vast amount of rides and amusements where easily you could spend a day Definitely worth a visit
6344,4,The park is great but no so family friendly I came with a baby and she only sat on the train The lines were horrible So long and one of the playgrounds in there did not let my eldest in You should come without kids Maybe with teenages
6345,5,Its great for a family outing Lots of shops and lots to see A must see for the whole family An indoor skating rink lots of restaurants There is also a museum and we took pictures with the traditional hanbok There were 7 in our group and each one of us dressed up and took a nice family portrait The lady that helped us was so nice and patient We wanted to give her an extra tip which she refused It was a very pleasant experience
6346,3,The Lotte World had divided two parts which was indoor playground and outdoor playground When I was young I had gone Lotte World once time with my family But we just went the indoor and didnt go to the outdoor because of the map was so complex and we didnt do research It was so regret in my mind that not to go the outdoor playground and I really wish that I will go the Lotte World once time in one day Therefore when my age grew up I determined that I need to complete my wish On June 2016 I went to Lotte World once time with my friend and found that it was not so fantastic It was because that although we woke up early got to Lotte World it still many people were waiting to go inside Moreover the rapid function was not enough to let we to play all game and rides The important was that some of games wasnt exciting Under this situation I was very disappointment However no matter how I disappointment I still complete my dream But I suggest you that Lotte World was suitable for family who had child baby and someone who had patience
6347,5,It was like I was a kid again when we went here There were extreme rides to that i really enjoyed it I will be back here soon
6348,5,We really enjoyed shopping in Lotte mall located in Dongdaemon Everything is well organised high quality garments currency exchange and food courts everything available at one tower Would recommend to everyone who likes pleasant shopping
6349,5,A lot of things to do all sorts of activities are offered for all tourists across all ages You need a whole day for this trip Visit the attraction in comfortable attires dont forget to bring your camera
6350,5,This indoor amusement park is huge We barely got to see a small portion of it Will have to go back a few more times to see all the attractions The staff are helpful to foreigners and can speak some necessary English to give directions The rides and activities have instructions in English as well
6351,3,Went for their Halloween night on the 31st October Its very crowded and not worth it to pay for the 1 day pass after 5pm The special are performers dressing up as various monsters and 4 existing rides painted or decorated in Halloween themes
6352,4,An excellent place for kids to enjoy with fantastic shows and a parade Good location by subway Line 2 going to Jamsil Station
6353,4,From Myeondong cathedral we passed by Lotte market Did shopping again Very cheap and affordable Lot of items for selection Big shop mall You can find everything that you can buy as presents going bck to your own home country You can also just enjoy window shopping if you dont have more than enough of ur budget Accessible in the main streets and to take train Always drop by this Lotte mall for shopping Its tax free or duty free tax shopping mall just present your passport
6354,5,Great indooroutdoor park Good blend of ride types for everyone Get there early for short lines After lunch it steadily got busier and busier and by 5 or 6pm the lines were long By 8pm young people were pouring in for the Halloween night at the park
6355,4,Just like a kid i was very happy to visit this amusement park Really enjoy the ride and the indoor park The castle is one of the must visit place and also we need to be patient about the long lines
6356,4,Lotte World is an amazing theme park and has an extremely big shopping mall with lots of shoppingfood choices for people of all ages Mustvisit when in Seoul Alight at Jamsil station if you want to go to Lotte World
6357,3,The theme park did not disappoint in terms of variety of activities but it is packed with many youngsters as it was their public holiday coupled with China golden week holiday The queue started for me to exchange the ticket to enter as I bought the tickets online before I travel The office to do this redemption is too small to handle such a crowd  The rides are fun but the 3D haunted house show was so boring and screen was not clear Need to improve on that The rides were great but simply too Long queue So for about 6 hours spent there we only took 4 rides and 1 3D show  Felt real old among all the youngster Did not stay for the night zombie show but it seems real good and the make up studio for the youngsters are doing a great job getting them ready for the party in the night
6358,4,Had a good time spending half a day with friends in Lotte World The place was big There were indoor and outdoor sections Indoor section was more childfriendly Outdoor section was more for the thrillseekers The parade was fun Do visit in the morning as soon as it open to avoid long queues
6359,5,I would have thought that the place is quite small as most of the rides are indoor but its surprisingly big They designed the rides so well that every rides seems to be right next to another They also have an mobile app for making appointment in order to avoid the super long line up
6360,5,excellent place for having family fun all rides  food and entertainment are top class The place is huge and warrant lots of time
6361,4,There are many activities ice link and folk museum etc that you can enjoy there for hours Especially its a lovely place for kids The line 8 stops at jamsil station
6362,4,This isnt Disneyland but my 8year old had fun nevertheless The indoor portion was great Adventure World  even if the weather turned bad youd still be nice and comfortable Quite a convenient and fun place to take kids for a morning or afternoon in Seoul
6363,4,Probably the biggest theme park in Seoul but extremely crowded Better to visit in the morning One of the biggest shopping area in Seoul You can buy highquality and fancy items in Lotte department store
6364,4,This Place will remind you of the Theme Parks that you visited during your Childhood Days But this one is much Advanced and better than the Ones you ever visited It has amazing Rides and eye Catching Attractions which will tempt you to test your Limits it will ignite the Long Lost Adventure seeking individual inside you
6365,3,Beautiful placeWouldnt think you were inside a huge complexOutside island was prettySeemed a bit prices to get in even the cheaper price later in the day
6366,3,This place is mostly for kids While there are a few rides that are suitable for adults most of this place is aimed at childrenteens So if you are on a family trip this is a must visit If you are adult friends on a trip this place can be left out  The place itself is 60 indoors and 40  outdoors It got lots of rides for kids and also features daily shows
6367,3,We trekked out here one day but Lotte Adventure world looked too juvenile for our 11 and 13 year old kids so we didnt go it I think it is more suited to under 9s
6368,3,Fascinating since a lot of the park is inside however the rides are a little disappointing and there arent a lot of them
6369,4,You will be able ton find in the place a mini Theme Park like Disney a department store and an indoor iceskating rink
6370,4,Is literally a world Ice skating slides restaurants Ideal for big groups of all ages Still prefer Everland in Yongin but this isnt bad
6371,4,What can I say Its just like most theme parks around the world but its indoors We went just after summer so it was still warm but I could imagine this would be a brilliant winter activity as its inside We enjoyed the air balloon ride to see all around the park
6372,4,You need one full day for Lotte World The main issue there is the waiting time may take more than two hours for each game
6373,1,Honestly if your looking for an amusement park your better off going to Seoul Grand Park instead Lotte World is jam packed with people overloaded with shops and selling points queuing is absurd over 100 min Im actually writing this review queuing for a 2nd attraction today They even turn you down at 5 pm from some attractions because of some kind of a parade This is my first and last time at this location Even with 50  discount its a total waste of time compared with Seoul Grand Park which is way way better and they also have discounts
6374,5,It is a good place for a family of all ages It has a place for a kid teenager and adults In the afternoon some staff dressing and look like zombies walking around to scare people
6375,4,Although its mainly for kids but the rides were quite thrilling Its an nice experience and I enjoyed my day there
6376,5,Little is one of a big name in Korea and all over Asia It is fun to spend time here Window shopping Watching movie and find things to eat It was great for people watching as well Lots of young cool people here
6377,4,So we decided after venturing to the Aquarium to try out the adventure world it is definately a place where everyone goes its in the place to be  Warning the weekends best to avoid think all locals come down for a great time and its a great time but be prepared for the very long queues but you can purchase a Maxi pass thats like a jump the queue
6378,4,The biggest advantage of this adventure park is that it is indoor so it is well airconditioned during summer
6379,4,It is a wonderful entertaining theme park for family especially for those with children It is really much better than those outdoor theme park in summer time However it is very crowded during weekend Suggest come here during weekday Then you will have more time to enjoy all the games
6380,5,The place was awesome specially if youre trying to hide from the sun yet still want to enjoy a theme park The park offers awesome rides from traditional carousels to extreme ones The food inside was relatively cheap compared to other famous theme parks in Asia the staff are so nice and can speak english the park is also conveniently located near a subway station which has a direct access to the park
6381,4,I was starstruck by the carousel which can be easily seen once you enter the park maybe because of the famous drama Stairway to Heaven yes it was shot here its great for winter because of its indoor concept however there is also an outdoor part which is called Magic Islandgreat for autumn or spring or maybe summer if the sun is not scorching hot But all in all Lotte World is a great place for family and friends whatever season it is 
6382,5,Dont miss this one Lotte World is just similar to any theme park in the world Great and most interesting place to visit in Seoul Korea Inside have nice restaurant souvenir shop and many more
6383,5,We went on a very busy day there were long queues but the rides were great especially the gyro drop Indoor and outdoor theme park with an ice rink and lots of food outlets
6384,3,The admission fee was pricy and they keep accept unlimited number of customers where it get very busy inside and you may wait more than 60 minutes for one game which make it not entertaining to wait more than threetime folds of gaming My advise to come early to save more time for queuing The bride at 2130 was nice and enjoyable but make sure to get nice spot next Lotte World main street
6385,4,Had fun there using the magic pass which is a must too bad I only had two We really enjoyed the folk museum It was great to see Korea historically and to learn about the country Due to the time we went we didnt get a chance to see the outside nevertheless it was great as an overall I would definitely go again
6386,5,It is them park part as outdoor and part as indoor with amazing night show for me I just want to walk around and enjoy the show and shopping inside so I came at 7 pm the tickets price will be less
6387,4,Good for kids and adults It has outside and inside attractions Very expensive in my opinion You can have a reduced price if you enter after 4 pm
6388,5,In Lotte I could fine all kind of clothes Not only clothes but also accesories pretty good and ethnic souvenirs I could fine here as a gift And in front of the Lotte me and my friends just sitting in the yard and many attracting buildings around
6389,4,Even before i visited this place that time i was excited but the ticket was too pricey this time i purchased ticket to master card i discounted to 20 even free pass tickets i really enjoyed this time I did not play much because of the rain but so happy
6390,4,The attractions are numerous and cost is very reasonable We visited on a Monday and several of the rides had lines of over 60 minutes We were able to leisurely navigate the amusement park and experience many of the attractions without having to wait too long at any one attraction We visited on a rainy day so it was nice to be indoors and not have to worry
6391,4,Little world will make your kids happy and never miss this place Its big a close area for games My recommend dont visit lotte world in weekends very busy and long time waiting but to avoid waiting time download there apps and buy your tickets
6392,5,We went there on 1st May and ended up spending the whole day there as there was so much to do for the kids ended up going there 2 more days
6393,3,Came here with a few friends on a weekday The lines were average for rides but there are not that many thriller rides This amusement park is more suited for childrenhigh schoolers Saw a lot of families and couples Some parts of the amusement park are neat such as the hot air balloon ride the Atlantis Ride the only fun ride Probably a great place for families and little kids but not for young adults It can get hot inside but luckily the food and drink prices are not super expensive
6394,5,Nice Place Very big building I have never been to an adventurious place like this before  Our hotel is near So i everyday come here
6395,3,There are plenty of rides for kids in the inside and outside areas of the park Good to visit on a rainy day with children but as most bigger rides are outside they might be closed during rain Be prepared for long lines 3050 min for the best rides In my opinion the place looks nice and most rides are good but it is still nothing like Disney or Universal Studios in Orlando FL  There was a foreigner discount when we visited so you might want to google that in case you find a coupon for that You can make reservations for some rides for free so that you can skip the line on a specific time but by noon there were no seats left for the rides that actually had a long line
6396,4,If you are to visit Lotte World do try to avoid the weekend It has a great selection of rides both inside and outside but you have to wait often over an hour just to get on each of these rides Dress comfortably as you will be doing a lot of standingwalking It is a must visit if youre in Seoul but as I said only once
6397,4,Lotte world truth to be told felt like a Disneyland wannabe However the atmosphere and buzz was there with enthusiastic and polite service staff The structure of the park was also very unique being integrated into a mall does come with certain restrictions but one thing for sure your ride experience is not being compromised French Revolution is a MUST  TIP There are certain special discounted entrance tickets for visits after 1pm and 3 or 4pm and yet all rides can be taken The park closes at 10pm so there is still time if you plan your rides smartly
6398,4,Nice modern mall Not many choices of restaurants Theres an indoor theme park good for those with kids around Personally we prefer Hyundai departmental shops
6399,4,Lots of rides in relatively small area Indoor facility Rides are not that modern or high tech One may have a feeling of too much in too small an area
6400,3,Went on a tues still long queue for most ride Need to pay addtional to go to pororo theme park which is within the park  Worth a visit but cant expect too much
6401,5,Its a paradise for adventure activity lovers you cant finish all rides in one day As it has two parts one indoor and one adventure park visitors must plan for two days Best suitable for age 10 years and above children
6402,4,This is definitely a place for small children Everything is geared for the young kids who like fairytales If you have visited Disney or any of the Great America Parks the only thing to say is that the lines are shorter The rides are on a caliber of many of the County and Neighborhood fairs throughout America That said we spent an enjoyable four hours walking around and watching tons of people of people really having fun There were groups of kids from schools and parents with their kids getting the thrill of a lifetime
6403,5,there is so much to do here from all the rides to the games to the shopping It is a fun place not only for children but children at heart The lines are a bit long on some of the rides but worth the wait
6404,4,Comfy nursery and changing room for nursing mothers refreshing toilets lots of locker for safekeeping lots of food drinkssnack and souvenir stalls The only low point is that December is not the best month to enjoy this indoor outdoor theme park Too crowded and such long que which you may end up only having 2 fun rides after spending almost 5 hours in the park
6405,5,So I wouldnt go out of my way to go here but if you wanted to go shopping its a very good mall With Duty Free and certain conversion rates you can find superb deals We saved hundreds of USDs by shopping here compared to what wed pay in the states
6406,5,We went with a 35 and almost 2 year old and they had a blast There were tons of things for them to do We hit all but like 2 rides that those under 100cm could do and we were there nearly all day We went on a Monday and I think our longest line was MAYBE 10 minutes We were disappointed that the playground in the Kids Zone was close It would have been nice to have known that before We of course had a short tantrum But it was really great and fun for the littles There was one ride that was pretty out dated Fantasy Dream or something 80s creepy animatronic
6407,4,A good mix of activities for the young teenagers couples family with kids It caters to all  Better than Everland
6408,5,We had a great time at the park The teenage boys loved the fast roller coasters and other rides Im not for that I enjoyed the train that took us from the outside park to the inside area above everything So much to see and do Id recommend this to everyone coming to town
6409,4,Before you go check out Lotte Worlds website for discount coupons We saved almost 50 on our admission fee The coupon said we had to have our passports to show we were foreigners but they never checked for them We took 3 kids 11 12 13 with us and they really enjoyed themselves There were rides and activities for everyone to enjoy We went midweek to avoid longer lines and I think that was a good call Our longest wait was 45 minutes for the big roller coaster We were annoyed that outside several of the big rides were closed This was not advertised and was disappointing Unlike parks in North America our bags were not searched for food so we were able to carry in some healthy snacks We bought lunch and ice cream inside at pretty reasonable prices Bathrooms are nice water in taps and fountains is potable The park has a lot to offer but is pretty compact which is nice as were werent totally exhausted from long walks between rides This is a wholeday outing Its really easy to access from the subway
6410,3,You know how a Samsung phone is fine if thats all you have but the design and interface pales in comparison to an iPhone Lotte World is like that compared to a Disneyland experience Its modeled after Disneyland but is an obvious fake but entertaining to see nonetheless  We managed to visit with an online 50 off deal for foreign passport holders for 24000 Won each about 20 USD So for that price it was a fine thing to do The wait for rides was 6090 minutes in the heat with nothing to look at not like at Disneyland where the lines are even an immersive part of the ride  Atlantis was a great ride that we did twice French Revolution was so jarring that it gave us all mild concussions The wait for the hot air balloons and the Comet Express were 70 minutes so we skipped those We knew we were visiting Tokyo Disneysea a few days later so we felt we had all gotten our 20 worth and called it a day after 3 rides that took about 5 hours to complete  So if this is the only amusement park you can get to its fine But if you have other experiences Lotte World is fine only if you can get a big discount and have teenagers you need to appease for a day
6411,4,Easy to reach by metro However the place is not as big and queues are long with some taking more than 60 mins we went on a Monday Surprisingly the food is quite nice
6412,5,Lotte World is unique to me Between a very nice hotel theater assuagement park kids indoor play area and more stores and restaurants than can be counted there is something for everyone It is easy to find since the nearby Lotte Tower 100 Stories dominates the skyline in the area
6413,4,Lotte World is great divided into indoor and outdoor and have many fun rides However this place is like half of Everland hence seems so small
6414,4,If you have children this is greatthey will have a great time Of course it isnt as amazing as disneyland but it is so much fun and isa really big park it even has a castle You could certainly spend a full day exporing even if you dont go on the rides
6415,5,This is probably the biggest entertainment complex in seoul You have from low end to high end products in this cpomplex from cheap food to expensive restaurant Indoor amusement park and indoor aquarium in the same complex Its beyond real You need days to finish it all Good with kids and family
6416,4,there are small outside area with games suitable for adults such as roller coaster and inside area with ice rink with many games more suitable for kids
6417,5,purchased one day pass we downloaded the magic pass which we can avoid the long queue well we did not stay long we already tired after few games we were a middle age couple who trying to have some fun apparently we had fun but for sure we will not come back for second time
6418,4,A fun  interesting place with both indoor and outdoor rides Great for kids to enjoy but be prepared to queue for some of the rides Outdoor rides might be closed during winter depending on weather conditions
6419,3,We went here and walked around a few hours before the location closes It was like being transported to a different world There were a lot of rides stores food vendors shows and photo opportunities in almost every corner A must place to visit specially if you enjoy amusement parks or have kids Also getting there was easy We took the metro and after 2 transfers and a few minutes walk we were there
6420,4,Lotte world was fun and exciting Loved the roller coasters Outdoors will be more fun for teenagers However long queues everywhere Be expected to wait 2 hours  during peak periods
6421,4,The teenagers love the area because of the rides Recommended to visit in the morning until closing to maximize the experience After lunch the lines for the rides became longer Shopping is also available as Lotte Mall is beside the park Accessible by MRT
6422,5,The staff is very friendly Lotte World is also near to restaurantshotels etc The rides are safe for the children The ticket price is worth it
6423,4,Cheap and easy to find Lotte world was a day well spent lines were quite long for the rollacosters even the bad ones TIP do Atlantis and the French revolution skip the others The lines were otherwise very manageable Staff were friendly and helpful I really enjoyed the mirror maze best Ive been to
6424,5,Shop til you drop One stop shop and easy access to the subway The lotte mart is where i bought a lot of facialbeauty products A must place to shop Thumbs up
6425,3,At first thought this park was more adult friendly but its pretty much for kids Nonetheless it is a good time to just go and hang out If youre looking for a good theme park with rides and attractions Everland would be your best bet
6426,4,We took our almost 2 year old to Lotte World Kids tori was the highlight of his trip well worth the entire trip There were only 5 rides he was tall enough to ride because it was raining we couldnt take him outside Overall it was a fun trip The parades and shows were all very good and well done Easy trip by subway
6427,4,We went there last year in october not too crowded you make a line for every attraction but you dont have to wait for long My kid 2 yo love every place we went there For him it was a good time for us we just love that he loved been there
6428,3,I went to Lotte World with a friend of mine and omg sad to say it was not our cup of coffee It was basically too crowded with locals Waiting time of almost all rides was like 1 hour to two hours I will say that it is good for kids as there is a large indoor theme park for kids however its not as good as Universal Studios to begin with since I overheard some locals saying that LotteWorld is the same as Universal Studios Haunted house needs to be improved It was super dissapointing that many people were afraid to get into the haunted house but all we just did was to be seated down and watch a scary animation movie which is not even scary to begin with The department store is not even something I will recommend to go too If you are coming from places like Singapore Malaysia US Europe its basically the same store as every other shopping mall Muslim travellers there is no halal food at all but there is side stalls that sells waffles and stuffs that you can eat Overall LotteWorld is dissapointing Will not recommend anyone to go but if you are a first timer why not try it once
6429,4,If you are interested in shopping you must visit this mall as it is probablythe biggest in town This complex also has the tallest building in the city Crowds of Chinese tourist come for their shopping
6430,4,Located inside Lotte mall this theme park wowed me with big rides available inside a mall This theme park also connected to outdoor area which available when the weather is good I visited this places during rain si better keep playing inside to avoid the cold weather once the rain stop the outdoor rides will be available Make sure you make a visit at a good weather day also check if there is any holidays happens during the week of your visit While Im visiting several school held a trip to this place so the crod made me hard to enjoy all the rides
6431,4,The moment you enter inside lotte world you will feel that you have stepped into another world and left citys hustle and bustle behind It is hard to believe that you are still in the midst of the city There are a number of rides here but the major minus point is you will have to wait hours together in the line for your turn to get the ride But dont let this discourage you as the rides are worth the wait An option to reduce your waiting time is download the lotte world app and after you buy your entry tickets book your ride from the app These people will get first preference to go for the rides We came to know about this too late so we couldnt avail this option  Dont miss the gyro drop ride It feels like you are having a free fall while sitting in a chair from 75 metres height By the time you finish your ride your adrenaline will be pumping into your veins and the euphoria is something to be experienced not to be explained
6432,5,This is just another amusement park So what makes it different from the rest Maybe the best part is lotte world have both indoor and outdoor rides I extremely love the outdoor GYRO rides; GYRO Drop GYRO Swing Thrilling  exciting As for the indoor rides The Conquistador seems to be my top choice This is my personal preference so it may not be the same for everyone
6433,4,Although lotteworld is smaller than seoulland and everland it is palced in seoul So it is convenient to go there by public transportation If being rainyou can play inside
6434,5,I loved this place A day isnt enough to see this place It would be better to go on weekdays is less crowded I recommend this place
6435,3,If you enjoy amusement parks then you should go We went early to beat the crowds but it was still crowded even on a nonholiday Tues Lines for the most popular rides were 2040 minutes by afternoon You had to pay extra for the haunted house and mirror maze There were plenty of food options and as an upside the prices werent inflated The park particularly inside was well maintained
6436,3,check out one time but the themes change really rarely so not much to do after u been to all rides in two hours
6437,5,That was a very wet tripnonstop rain during that few days trip Luckily we booked the Character twin room The room was not just only very colorful kidsfriendly clean and tidy even the character soft toys were so clean that my girl has no hesitation to hug them once she entered the room but also the whole corridor of that floor was well decorated It was very attractive once the lift door was opened  Best of all the staffs of Lotte World Hotel were so friendly and helpful especially the staff of concierge Not just giving us very warm greeting whenever we passed by while we were staying for the whole day in the hotel due to the heavy rain but also giving us excellent advise and brilliant idea of visiting the local Korea culture that we could not even found that from any travel guide book  My little girl just feel like home when she was staying in Lotte World Hotel and that would be my first choice of staying hotel in Seoul
6438,4,Absolutely huge mall and entertainment center Lots of places to go with friends family or alone Good for shopping leisure activities and relax
6439,5,Got 50 discount coupon from the website and it was a super cool theme park There are so many rides both indoor and outdoor plus shopping and eating The view was great too as it was the full bloom of cherry blossom thus you can enjoy the nature and have fun at the same time
6440,4,Amazing place So huge Better to download the app for getting fast pass because the lines are very long
6441,5,Our teenagers liked Lotte world better than Disneyland Only goofy thing was that it had an age limit on a number of rides of 65 years old
6442,5,This is an amazing park for what its worth Various options for children and adults Ice rink is separate from the park We took a airport bus to our hotel when we arrived and there was a discount coupon attached
6443,3,We went to Lotte World just to visit Hard Rock shame that they have chosen to put their location so far from the tourist center Hard Rock was good fast and organized most expensive food we ate in Korea There is a stage so expect they have bands the mall is a really big mall with everything and seems the prices are better as you are out of the center
6444,4,The general admission ticket is only for entrance watch shows and take pics  Rides not included You should buy the day pass ticket to include all the rides  If you have 2 yrs old kid They are free in 3 kinds of rides  So they can ride in all rides  Pay 12000 won We as family 2 adults 1 6yr old and 1 2 yr old paid 146000 won for day passes  Unlimited rides No lines on sundays
6445,3,Most rides and deco looks really old like a 90s amusement park  Long Queue of rides I personally feel that its over priced  Not recommend for teenagers   The selling point is the night fiesta whereby they dim all lights and they paraded with acrobats dressed in LED outfits and some fire works 
6446,4,When we reached lotte world the parade has just begun We took a lot of pictures as they are very beautiful and unique  The queue to the rides are not the long so we ride as many as we can However some of the rides close early  Do wear comfortable shoes as you will walk a lot
6447,4,a good amusement park with an outdoor area and a mall inside a different concept all together but there are some rides which would need additional payment to ride or to go into
6448,5,Great place for kids and has a variety of things to do for all ages  Loved the toddles section and my older kids had loads to do as well  Definitely a place worth to visit
6449,5,Lotte world is one of my favorite attractions in Korea I would highly recommend this place if you want to make some great memories Its a place for both children and adults Try to reach lotte world as early as possible in the morning around its opening time It would be less crowded then Keep the information guide map handy all the time It will help you a lot covering attractions more efficiently As soon as we reached lotte world we rushed to the roller coaster French Revolution which is on the 2nd floor In the morning time the waiting queue is small So if you want to avoid long queues I would suggest you to grab the opportunity asap I simply loved this indoor roller coaster ride It was thrilling as well as super fun Next we made a clever strategy and decided to cover the attractions in top to down fashion starting from the 4th floor all the way down to the underland B1 floor I think that helped a bit avoiding long queues and we could cover our desired attractions quickly Dont forget to visit the Wild 4D shows wind valley and jungle in underland B1 floor Its a super amazing experience The best among the all was wild wind And you can skip the other two After covering all the floors we next moved on to the Magic land which is outdoor It also has many thrilling outdoor rides My favorite of all is Atlantis roller coaster DO NOT miss this ride if you want to experience a real thrill Waiting queue is too long but its worth the wait My next favorite in the magic land was comet express with rolling chairs I came out laughing and it was pretty amazing I truly dont feel that one day is enough to cover all the attractions in lotte world As per the meals are concerned we carried our own homemade food for lunch There are also many and a great variety of restaurants out there For vegetarians like me there is a restaurant named Lake Pizza in the magic land which serves New York style pizza and its super yummy Do plan a full day tour and avoid rainy days and weekends if possible Also avoid going in winter season as many outdoor rides are closed Dont waste too much time clicking photographs as you might miss some super fun rides out there Trust me one day is just not enough Good luck and have fun 
6450,4,I went here only for the hard rock cafe shirt  Then i saw they play this movie from big screens and the screen movingwow hahah Outside you can see pororolots of pororo
6451,4,You need more than a day to explore the whole place From mall restaurants to amusement park A nice place to visit Various popular international brand shops and international cuisine restaurants
6452,3,Definitely a great place for kids and families as long as your kids dont mind the wait My husband and I went by ourselves over a holiday weekend because they had a 50 discount for foreigners The lines were just unbearable but I suppose this is Korea Because half of the park is indoors I felt very overwhelmed by all the noises and people If you can go on a weekday when the lines arent so long its probably worth it
6453,5,Shopping havens will take more than a day to finish Visited top levels for duty free shopping Go to the basement for food court Plenty of foods to choose from
6454,4,If youre traveling to Seoul with kids add Lotte World to your itinerary We visited last December and its a good thing that it has an indoor amusement park because it was below zero the day we visited aside from the rides and attractions outdoor They have kids rides family rides and thrill rides for those who like it extreme We personally enjoyed the 4D simulation rides in Underland as well as the games in the first floor The amusement park also has a mini zoo and a museum where you can learn more about Koreas rich history
6455,2,I was not impressed at all I think everland is prob a better choice The rides were not impressive and there were too many kids queuing up so waiting time is crazy
6456,3,Will we went there but unfortunately my kids didnt like it that mush although the games looks interesting  There was Carnival I like and it was cute there was a lot to see but the bad thing is if you want there ice skating you have to go out and you cant go back unless you pay again for your ticket The tickets was expensive we were 2 adults  2 teenagers and 1 child total it was 200 dolors also there was some places inside you have to pay again to see it 
6457,3,We brought our 3 boys 14 13 and 10 While they enjoyed some rides most of them were geared to younger children We also took them ice skating at the inside rink but they did not enjoy this part at all way too many people maybe if we visited on a weekday it would have been different
6458,4,We got discounted tickets so be sure to check for discount online The theme park has both indoor and outdoor portions The rides in the indoor park are mostly for younger kids while the scarier rides are outside Unfortunately many rides indoors were closed when we were there Aside from the rides there are also many shops and food stalls One day should be spent in Lotte World
6459,3,Just a normal shopping center they have duty free at the top floor but we found that some of the cosmetics prices are more expensive than the department store downstaires so dont be fooled do check around the prices before you purchased anything And the staffa at duty free speak very poor poor english Shopping at the airport might be better They also have aquarium here
6460,2,This is good for small children But there are many Chinese ruined the place Talking loudlythe staffs not nice Their focus is how to catch childrens attention and not others Not good interior design Bad connectivity and accessibilityainot worth to visit
6461,4,This place was fun but very crowded on a rainy day so lines were extremely long I mean hours long which made it less fun I would go again though for sure
6462,5,Like my visit here  its like wonderland though i can t take any rides this trip is still worth it Theres just too many people queveing up for the ridestoo bad
6463,4,I went here with my friends and we were amazed by its huge size One day is not enough to tour all the attraction especially with the long queue on the rides sometimes it took us one hour before we can get into rides it is really time consuming so i suggest if you have the budget  book in their hotel for 2 days to maximize your visit Good thing we were able to get cheap ticket 60 discount There were also lot of restaurant to choose from and they have lotte mart to shop which we did before leaving the park You will really enjoy coming here as it is indoor with an air condition so no problem if it rains
6464,4,Fun place with lots to see and do Wish i was younger so i could really enjoy the rides The place is laid out beautifully Spend time and enjoy a day its worth it
6465,5,very good place very big place when you can spend all day their good for family and all type of traveler i spend 4hrs without feeling the time
6466,3,You would expect such a big place to spread people out a bit But the queues were very long The kid rides we were interested in took about 45 minutes  That aside its a must visit if you visit Seoul It can be a lot of fun if you catch it right
6467,4,Lotte World is one of Korea biggest theme park This theme park is unique as theres an outdoor and indoor park The outdoor are for sure extreme playground  When youre outdoor please keep yourself hydrated As I went was winter you dont sweat but you get dry skins and thirsty fast  Keep yourself healthy to enjoy the games
6468,4,the waiting time in the lines of the attractions where quiet long because we went there on a crowdy day Additionally we used the After4 Tickets because it was a bit cheaper but in the end we wished to have more time in the park Anyways it was fun to visit the biggest indoor amusement park of the world
6469,1,Awful awful awful We spent a lot of money to get in plus transportation and the wait for each ride even the kids rides were 120 minutes minimum There was little to do and it was a total bust We were very disappointed
6470,4,Very good indoor amusement park however lot of rides events and activities and parades You had to wait long time for your turn Over all nice place to spend for a day outing
6471,4,Great experiences with kids Many shows and events are waiting for your family Mostly expensive but worth taking your kids out for some fun rides and different experiences
6472,4,They claim to be the largest indoor amusement park While easily believable I wish they have added more rides or optimised their quee management system to make lines shorter
6473,3,This was a great place to spend a cold January day Indoors and heated Good but not great range of rides and attractions Although we arrived early we were still unable to book onto some popular attractions
6474,5,A definite must go for the kids Visited twice with Kidd during our week long vacation in Seoul Came back subsequently for a second time on the second visit Recommend to stay in Lotte World Hotel next door if it is your first trip with young children who still need naps
6475,5,Go with your family  to Lotte World early and you need two days to finish all attractions Therere a lot of restaurants coffee snacks shops
6476,3,We went here on a Saturday when most of the outdoor activities were closed so hat may have contributed to the line We waited in a line that said 90 min wait It was about 80 min The food is no more expensive Han any other amusement park It was a sight to see Almost an entire amusement park that is indoors This was a good experience but not so great for teenagers so we will not return but I would recommend for young children especially if you can do during the week
6477,4,Visited with my aunt from Vienna Austria There were some fun rides and a really cool hot air balloon ride around the entire park The mall is a separate attraction so dont try to leave Lotte World and get back in They wont let you The only reason my aunt and I were able to leave and then come back is because I was quite assertive about it It was extremely crowded so if you dont mind lots of people give it a try
6478,4,More adapted for the younger ages some rides are still suited for the older ones The gyro drop is definitely my favorite
6479,3,Too many tourist  too crowded Cant really enjoy much  Kids love the SM Town  bought a lot of things
6480,5,Lotte world was just awesome You will get everything under one roof I bought ReFa massage device from there And collected from airport Feeling Awesome I would like to visit here again and againseoul is just awesome
6481,5,It is not a huge one but a lovely place I like the parade It looks awesome Pretty much the same or better Disney Worlds parade
6482,4,Big indoor theme parkbut too crowdedwaited 1 ride for about 3hrsdidnt manage to play alot Outdoor themepark have more exciting rides
6483,4,Even though there are long lines and a lot of people I really enjoyed coming here with my friends No Im not being sarcastic My friends and I talked a lot and got to know more things about each other while waiting in line It was quite fun And we got to ride a lot of rides They were really fun especially French evolution Gyro Spinswingdrop and the Atlantis By the way since these attractions are the most popular I recommend you come early in the morning when theres not as much as people and wait in line or get a fast pass And for the people whod rather shop than go to an amusement park they can skate at the ice rink or shop at Lotte department store Coming here was a fun but tiring let me tell you that experience and I wish go back there soon
6484,4,Its got everything If its raining outside this makes for a great alternative for something to do Not wowed but was well fed and entertained by all the shops and restaurants inside
6485,4,Lots of rides and attractions to choose from 3 times more expensive than what we have in our country but Id say this is definitely more worth it especially if tou go there early This is like heaven for kids and kids at heart  too bad i wasnt able to enjoy the more extreme rides because nobody in my group would like to join me  it was still a cool experience though
6486,5,We had a great time It was closing time by the time we ventured outside but it was still really cool
6487,2,We went during peak season and there was so many people lining up for every single ride There are magic passes for three rides and you can reserve a time for quick access and avoid the queue However we found that most of the rides had their allocation exhausted and we couldnt use the magic passes Wait times were around 40100 minutes for the popular rides We got shortchanged buying the headbands from the stalls and the food is pretty bland and staff not particularly attentive or friendly
6488,2,So expensive Games arent that good the only adventurous games are interesting but its expensive compared to the Games if you want to lose your day there but the metro station to Lotte word is a piece of Art mini Roma style 
6489,5,For those who have been to the Mall of America in Minnesota this is just like that except it doesnt have the outdoor feeling There is a lot to do at this indoor theme park We went on a weekday so it wasnt too crowded but had to queue 20 min tiger the tickets My kids had a lot of fun and in 3 hours we went on about 6 rides I didnt like all the bright lights though The excessive use of lighting is one thing about Seoul which I didnt like It is worse than Tokyo We got very tired and withdrawn mostly because of the lighting and because it was indoors Still a great day out on a rainy day
6490,4,Lots of rides and different activities performance to see and do that will definitely keep your kids entertained and you constantly on your feet trying to keep up with them However like any popular theme places in Seoul best to avoid weekends or public holidays to maximise your enjoyment otherwise be ready to handle accept the crowd and long queues We have been to lotte world about 5 times now over a period of 7 years and my boys have enjoyed every visit
6491,5,The area is HUGE It includes Lotte World Theme Park Lotte Mall and Lotte Department Store Can easily spend a day there Since the entire area is either indoors or underground except for Lotte World Theme Park exterior area it is good during rainy or very cold days
6492,4,There have indoor and outdoor themepark conceptsThere every day opening hour 10am until 10pm Inside also have small stall can shopping walk aroundIf peak season waiting rides may take more time to queue
6493,3,Visited Lotte World on 22122015 Many people with very long queues for all the rides Some rides may need to wait for 90mins long Do not recommend to dine there as it is pretty expensive and food arent tasty This theme park looks a little dated in comparison to Universal Studio Singapore and also Genting Indoor Theme Park
6494,5,He loved the parade and the rides Wide eyes and amazement  We were bummed that you need to be 7 years old to skate at the ice rink but at 115 cm we got to ride the cooler rides
6495,4,This lotte world is in the city so easy to go and their parade was great Although small since it is located in city but there are many exciting rides
6496,4,This small but exciting amusement park you can enjoy all exiciting ride However it is a little bit expensive
6497,5,I would like to say best for kids If you have a kid should to go to Lotte World and an enjoy with your kids its possible to skating  there are many shops to enjoy
6498,4,The kids will love it here with so many rides to enjoy There is also an ice skating ring and many shops for the adults
6499,5,indoor and outdoor theme park good place for kids and also for couples to enjoy their weekend or public holiday there have a disney show on the special day not sure what day it is ticket is affordable have bag locker access to this theme park with subway city bus and taxi really enjoy to be there
6500,5,We were there for the 4pm admission Since it was freaking cold we decided to try the outdoor rides first It was drizzling all the way but we did managed to try some thrilling rides Queues for the rides was pretty long about 2040 mins wait The indoor activities and rides were equally nice too My kids enjoyed much We left at 10 pm
6501,5,It is very good place for indoor amusement park in the winter  In my opinion for asian traveler it is very good eventhough the size is very small compared with Everland because it has indoor and small outdoor zoneMagic Island So you dont worry about cold wearher  But if you want to enjoy snow Everland is best Everland has Snow Sleigh  There are small ice link so you can enjoy ice skating  
6502,3,This is a very fun trip in koreaDont go in weekendI go in the theme park in weekend and is very long queueIn the endI play a few thingsMost of the safety precaution is in koreaI dont understand koreaI felt that is kind of dangerous to play itI m happy to visit it as running man has came here before
6503,3,Lovely simple indooroutdoor theme park but we had to queue for so long we only managed to get on a few rides Disappointing day trip and have not been back since
6504,5,Nice room and great location The hotel is very close to shopping malls and restaurant and connected to subway Very helpful staffs
6505,5,I just simply cant say anything bad about it Many people here compare this place with other huge amusement parks in the world Well its a different place Dont expect it to be the same It IS in fact the largest indoor amusement park thus its very popular so its normal to have so many people there Yes the waiting can get too long but its no different than in any other popular amusement parks It is expensive too but the variety of the rides and other games the pretty views the shows and the overall magical mood of the place totally makes up for it There are many cheap restaurants and some souvenir shops inside Also if you go to their website they usually have discounts especially around holidays Christmas Halloween and for foreigners also you can just buy the afternoon ticket All it takes is a little research Its better to go on weekdays to avoid the crowd I think its more about the mood and less about the rides Been there 3 times and always had a good time
6506,5,The theme park is awesome The outdoor and indoor game were so fun  they also sell a lot of yummy food and beverage Its really cool Should go there when all of u visit seoul
6507,4,shop and enjoy the rides one of the most amazing and largest malls i have visited so far indoor amusement park is really great and a lot of fun check the website for further info and ticket prices certain hours will affect the ticket price
6508,4,If you like theme parks a bit sickly sweat and tung in check then this is great We went in the evening so there were lots of teenagers and the queues for the rides were 40 minutes to a hour long Only did a couple of the rides but they were good Doing rollercoasters in the dark was a first for me and I quite liked it The place shuts at 2200 It is quite expensive but if you have a local friend then certain banks and organisations can get you a big discount we payed a third of the asking price by paying io a local bank card There are also lots of rides for younger children and there was a big childrens show on in the evening
6509,5,Many toddler friendly areas Pororo park although paid for separately was a wonderful place for toddlers to play and run around
6510,5,A brilliant place with a lot of rides in or outside with lots of snack sold Although some rides need money the House of horrors  I think its called that  is not recommended for children under seven or maybe even nine
6511,5,Here is a place where you can spend lots of time and enjoy it all They are a bit cautious about seniors but not restrictive Great to have the overview ride and you can determine your level of activities and eating style Very enjoyable
6512,4,There are 2 portion to the Theme Park One indoor  Mostly for kids; Two outdoor  where all the thrilling rides are  Go on a weekday afternoon if possible as after 8pm there will be lots of tourist and queuing for the rides will take forever  In winter remember to bring warm clothing for the outdoor portion
6513,4,It was a fun theme park One day wont be enough It has two main parks indoor and outdoor Children teenagers young adults and elderly all can enjoy this park as they have many options They also have folk museum
6514,4,The happiest place for children and adults who hace the heart of children Spacious place to be covered in one day Quite challenging and exciting A must visit place in Korea
6515,4,It was nice to have rides indoors and outside There is a big ice rink too I found it expensive When we went into the park some of the rides you had to pay extra for
6516,5,We when to Lotte World during Chuseok holiday the best decision ever because they gave huge discount on the tickets To avoid long cues better go there in the morning as not so many people compared to in the evening We stayed there the whole day because the park has indoor and outdoor play
6517,3,The theme park is quite small with a number of rides for kids and teens and adults to enjoy Honestly it isnt the most exciting theme park ever but if you have a few hours to spare then might as well give it a go Its located in a mall and theres an ice rink right in the center There is also an outdoor section with a few more rides We wanted to go on the roller coaster outside but unfortunately it was under construction Overall its not a must see but its fun for the kids
6518,5,This place is simply wonderful Its worlds largest indoor theme park and they have thought about everything Great facilities friendly staff awesome rides Even though Magic Island is outdoors but the bulk of the rides are indoors so we can play all day long completely unaffected by the weather
6519,4,Lotte World reminded me alot of the indoor mall amusement park in Edmonton Canada Very self contained but fun place to people watch the natives having alot of fun Also food there was expensive except for the Lotte fast food place there
6520,4,I went out of curiosity Fun to walk around esp The folk museum Definitely for the 319 yr group which looked to be enjoying themselves a lot Lots of schoolkids in their uniforms and young families Ambitious to have an ice rink carousel rides indoors and the crazy gyro rides outdoors
6521,3,If you love your rides then its a lovely place to go and visit There are plenty of activities for everyone so if your not too interested in seeing the rides or the ice rink then you are able to go out to the lotte shopping mall Everything is connected so you will have fun just make sure you keep in contact with the people you go with as you can easily get lost in the place its huge
6522,4,We were lucky enough to be in Seoul close to Thanksgiving and they had a 2 week foreigner special 50 off tickets So we went to check it out Definitely a cool place Not too many adult rides but theres some good ones  but be prepared to wait an 1hr for some but try to get some magic passes Pretty cool to see the inside with the multiple floors  the largest indoor theme park in the world The outdoor area is also really nice Some rides we really liked were the balloon ride french revolution and Atlantis pharaohs fury was unfortunately closed and the flume ride was too long of a wait Probably wouldnt have come if we had to pay full price but had a great time  Also with your ticket you get free entrance into the folk museum on the 3rd floor Actually really cool and they have a miniature village section with great models Not too many people visit the museum but def worth checking out
6523,5,The park is both indoor and outdoor Its a perfect place for families with kids Lotte World has a lot to offer  roller coasters parades performances etc Once of the must visit places in Seoul in my opinion
6524,4,It is possible to spend the all day long there Many interesting attractions but so many people Dont miss the shows
6525,4,High end shopping mall with tax free prices and nice food courtbut it is expencive compered to so no bargins or good dealsbut ask for a extra discount on very expencive items
6526,4,I went there during last Christmas it was very crowded All attraction Qing at least an hours or so most of the attraction are suitable for children
6527,4,My teenage girls loved this place It has both indoor  outdoor rides It was very crowded when we visited it on a Friday especially during the evening time We saw many locals as compared to tourists maybe it was due to the MERS period The rides  facilities were quite wellmaintained
6528,5,This is like a manageable Disney World Our 7 year old absolutely loved it Roller coasters and rides were so much fun and the lines werent too terrible Its also located near some really awesome shopping
6529,5,This park was absolutely amazing I and my friends spent a whole day there to try all the games it has Roller coaster was most fun and thrilling At this time of the year you might have to wait a bit but I dont mind Cant wait for a comeback
6530,3,This isnt the best amusement park of Korea You should visit Everland in Yongin Though they open during the night but your selection would be limited Get this place as early as possible because it would soon be crowded
6531,3,This amusement part located in jamsil eastern part of Seoul has many rides but nothing special Its rides are quite old and they dont seem to add new ones these days But still its always fun visiting an amusement park But be aware that they had some safety accidents few years ago
6532,4,I visited in the winter so could not take much outdoor rides But there are nice rides indoor rides as well which we enjoyed a lot
6533,3,If youre with kids then this is the best place to visit But if youre looking for an adultoriented rides then Everland is a better pick
6534,4,you must visit if traveling with kids the place is huge either is the biggest indoor theme park I think but not so sure you can find mickey and minnie mouse is different way as Lotte character
6535,5,We visited Lotte World this spring and it was surprisingly fun We spent 3 rainy days in Seoul but we found many interesting attractions indoors that we enjoyed very much Lotte World was one of them We were very surprised at how well everything is organized inside the park Its a great place to take your kids and play around the ice rink or any of the other attractions inside the park We took our nephews there and we had a blast Bought our tickets on Klookcom and saved around 10 USD in total for all 5 of us
6536,5,My two year old son loved this indoor theme park We went on a weekday and although there was a good size crowd we never had to wait overly long for any one ride The complex is six stories high and all interconnected well enough for our little man to lead the way and choose his path Mostly recommend the Fantasy forest interactive zoo area
6537,3,Lotte World consists of outdoor and indoor theme park Outdoor theme park is kinda small with a snow white castle as well If you are not interested with rides you may purchase the ticket without ride There are some skin care shops too I didnt go for rides but I visited the shows and kinda interesting There is parade show at about 8pm if not mistaken
6538,5,Excellent shopping mall where you can find whatever you want and do a lot of different activities Lot of highend stores so this is not your average cheap store in Korea
6539,4,We dont have theme parks at home not proper ones at least so tried to do every adult ride we ending up spending about 7 hours here and didnt even get through them all there are a lot It was an enjoyable day and the lines werent too big we went at peak of MERs scare which likely was the reason of small waiting times If you are short on time be sure to prioritise the rides you really want to do
6540,5,We had fun It is best to go on a weekday to avoid huge crowds The rides vary and the staff was very welcoming The folk museum was great as well and free There is easy acess to food and the mall
6541,5,Had gone there with my wifeson and a friend and can never forget the experienceThe park is so huge that its divided into two partsan indoor and outdoor one Air balloonroller coastersscary rideswaterridesairlifts and it goes on Its impossible for one to explore both the outdoor and indoor parts in one single dayone has to follow the queues everywhere before enjoying a ride owing to the massive crowd and that can be taxing at timesnevertheless its worth the ride A MUST VISIT with family when you are in Seoul Easily accessible using the underground rail
6542,4,Lots of activities for kids and adults of all ages Pretty worthwhile not too expensive and they offer lots of discounts for foreigners The price tickets are age dependent so the younger you are the cheaper it gets Go on the weekdays so it doesnt get too crowded
6543,4,Amazing amusement park good location and great fun for family with kids Nice and helpful staffs I suggest the visitors to reserve one whole day to enjoy all the facilities in the park I think only half day is not enough
6544,2,I was honestly looking forward to having a lot of fun in Lotte World ever since I arrived in South Korea I dont know it just didnt quite meet up my high expectation of it since Ive seen photos and a documentary about it The rides were soso People made it look thrilling but to me it was a disappointment
6545,5,Was a beautiful trip and hotel services are excellent and we found an excellent attention of the administration and the two works in the hotel and especially MrYour Allen lee He always meets our requests respectfully We thank him very much for all the services carried out for us
6546,3,We thought it was the worlds largest indoor theme park but its one of the We dont have kids but we thought it would be good for a rainy day There was really only 1 roller coasterMy husband liked the 3 shooting games but besides that there wasnt much for us Food is overpriced We ended up doing 9 rides but that averaged out to 850 per ride for 2 ppl Something to see but not so fun if you dont have kids
6547,4,Well there is plenty to see and do here We managed to kill more than a few hours wandering around
6548,2,Was very disappointed on the games and machine for us to play with The gadgets are not well maintained and dirty Food kiosk too little at the outdoor
6549,4,The inside is very cool A very well made theme park inside and outside The attractions are also fun but never ever come on weekends if you dont wanna wait 2 hours for every ride I came on a thursday and the longest time i waited for a ride then was 30 minutes at least Maybe you should bring some food if youre vegetarian
6550,4,We visited Lotte World at the end of our Seoul trip and really enjoyed it Aim to get there at opening time as it gets much busier later in the day We visited on a week day and managed to fit in around 15 rides as opposed to Everland where we only did 6 due to long lines The food options were quite diverse and reasonably priced Lotte World has a quick pass system on some rides so make sure you take advantage of it
6551,4,This place can be pretty crowded so try to plan accordingly Convenient location connected to a metro station You can get discounts to the park a variety of different ways so take a look ahead of time to see if youre eligible for any of the current promotions
6552,4,This place is really good to visit and have fun with especially if you have kids The lines for the rides were pretty long and most of them have an hour wait but thats the only bad part There are so many rides for adults and children alike This is a definite must go place in Seoul
6553,4,It really is a fullscale amusement park indoors It would be perfect for visiting Seoul in the winter with kids One part is outdoor where they start the biggest rides so youd have to bring some clothes for that but for the rest weather doesnt matter My son loved it more than Tokyo Disneyland although he did like Seoul Land better because its a conventional park lots more space and rides Lotte World is worth a look though good for younger kids or up until later teen ages
6554,5,This place is so amazing As we are on a school trip we had a tour of the place and after that we had a presentation After presentation we had lunch and we were free to enjoy the whole place Amazingly theres indoor and outdoor theme park Due to our schedule we had only 4hours to explore the whole place Some rides are really just for kids u have to choose the right rides Indoor theres like mirror world roller coaster and ice skating ring Outdoor theres the bigger rides like gyro swing and gyro drop As with other theme park there were many people queuing up For indoors ride some have this machine where u can get your queue number which theres time on it u just have to go on that time to get into the ride straight away instead of waiting Super experience overall will go back again youtube  lolsia2000 for videos when im at there
6555,4,It is a marge amusement park with everything you expect attractions restaurants shows It is a great place but it is also very crowded and you may have to wait for several hours to go to one attraction  I just went around without doing any of these attractions
6556,5,The location is so convenient The park is bigger than it looks on the outside Staff friendly and well organised A fun day out for the family
6557,4,Kids uner 9 yrs old are funniest place to play and enjoy these attractions inside  At Outside many attractions are available for all age persons but we should take a lot of time to wait in a line thats why its so hard in the winter season
6558,4,It was a rainy Monday in Seoul when my husband and I decided to bring our teenager daughters to Lotte World From Samseoung it only took us 15 minutes via Taxi to go to Lotte World The park is also connected to subways lines 2 and 8 Lotte World is made up of two parks The Magic Island outdoor and more thrilling rides and Adventure  indoor more on kids rideWe got lucky the rain stopped in the afternoon so we enjoyed the both sides of the park The National Folk Museum inside Lotte World is also a bonus its a beautiful exhibit of the Three Kingdoms of Korea Overall the experience was fun and enjoyable It exceed my expectations and my family all agreed that Lotte World is a great Seoul experience
6559,4,There was a lot to do here though me and my husband basically just walked around and relaxed The lines were very long so other than food we did the balloon ride the trick art museum and thats about it It would have been great for kids We also watched the characters put on a show from a hot dog places window
6560,5,I only heard about Lotte World from some Youtube videos I was so pleasantly surprised that it took less than one hour from Insadong using the metro railsubway system You can buy a day pass but we got there after 400 pm so the admission fee was US 17 per person to ride all the rides and the lines were short Lotte World has an outdoor part which is sort of like a much smaller version of Disneyland in California and two indoor parts which has rides for younger kids There is even a skating rink on the bottom floor I rode the big kids rides in the outdoor part which has a castle modeled on the Sleeping Beauty Castle in Disneyland If you have had enough of palace tours and want to eat cotton candy while looking for some fun this is the place for some roller coaster type rides This place is not as big as Disneyland in California or even Six Flags Magic Mountain or any of the serious scary rides in the USA It reminds me of Ocean Park in Hong Kong
6561,3,Big and lots of attractions for every age The signage is not very clear so you might get lost easily Staffs not able to communicate much in English Some restaurants inside are terrible If you buy a daypass ticket doesnt mean youre able to exit and enter again which is bad
6562,5,This was a pretty cool amusement park  part inside and part outside There are cartoon characters and parades like at the Disney properties Although Lotte World is smaller and falls short of the spectacle of the Disney properties Lotte World is full of rides and at least when we were there not as crowded as a Disney property In fact the kids who have been to Tokyo Disney and Disneyland Paris said this was their favorite of the three
6563,4,Great place to be with kids Good entertainers good rides spacious might be a bit boring for adult but with kids it was good fun
6564,3,There are both a indoor and outdoor section of the park Indoor section is catered for young kids with many kiddy rides while the outdoor section is catered for youths and adults with thrill rides We went with young kids and they do enjoy themselves at the indoor section Overall the admission fee is expensive and not worth the money if you only cover the indoor section
6565,3,My Family and I were here at Lotte World for a day Agree with my fellow Trip Advisors It just simple family fun for a day but besides the food being bland I have to credit to the healthy foods like the smoothie king It tasted great But regarding the park itself its just worth a visit to experience a large indoor amusement park But would not go back One experience is enough Another drawback is that some parts of the park still had payment needed like the mirror maze The skating rink is not part of your ticket and if you want to go ice skating you get out of the park but cant get back in One plus are the toilets Very clean Too bad they dont equip it with a bidet like my hotel and other public toilets in Japan
6566,4,During winter it is not nice to go here The outdoor rides are closed for safety Though you could still take pictures  There is a photographer in front of the castle they take polaroid pictures Its a good souvenir  Theres also a parade at 7 or 8 in the evening Its fun to watch
6567,4,Young people will love this place Quite cool attractions But restaurant I never visit again Its better to buy food from outside
6568,2,We visited for a day during our week stay in Seoul As adults we wanted some thrilling rides We went on a Wednesday so the crowd wasnt that bad I think the longest we waited for was 40 minutes  Anyway the indoor rides are alright You get a nice view of the whole scene on a couple of them The outdoor park is where all the fun is I really enjoyed Atlantis and the Gyro Drop  On the other hand the food is really terrible The vendors dont keep their food at a warm temperature We tried three different vendors and barely ate anything We were starving on our way out ready for some real food
6569,3,This is a nice fun place to take the kids when you have been stationed in South Korea for awhile This is all indoors much like a large USA shopping mall Not much rides but kids will enjoy the athmosphere
6570,5,Took my 4 year old boy to the park  we beat the queue at the entrance by getting a pass from the Lotte World Hotel and discounted too We went after 4 and some junior rides were quick to get on There were lots of rides suitable for under 7 and the little guy had a great time We went once before in summer and this time in winterspring when its subzero outside The indoor park caters well for both weather Staff are quite good with English too
6571,4,Not as big as other parks Ive been too but it has its charm Went with my lil sis we both enjoyed Loved Sinbad boat the most
6572,3,My young children really enjoyed themselves here I do think it was priced a little high for what it was BUT once inside all the rides were free The food in the restaurants was nothing to write home about The parade was excellent and i did note that there was a lot for children of all ages to enjoy not just my little kids This is worth a visit for 35 hours
6573,5,Everyone from child to adult can enjoy rides I love the roller coaster
6574,3,We went there on a winter so we only explore the indoor park Not as huge as Universal Studio in Japan or Disneyland in Hongkong but kind of fun and enjoyable especially for the kids and the kids at heart It is also very accessible since it is connected to a metro station Also the COEX mall is one station away so you can do shopping before or after your visit to the Lotte World If you go there after 4pm the entrance fee is lesser One drawback is that you have to pay extra so that you can ride the attractions
6575,3,It is a great place for kids and offer good discount for tourist with many excellent shows  We visited on Monday afternoon and joined afternoon session there were so many people here and each games took about hour
6576,5,Lotte world is not only fun place for kids but also for adults We had an amazing experience with some of the rides which I will never forget in my whole life Going up to see view of seoul city and then having a free fall from thr within a second was breathtaking but awesome experience then to roller coaster ride was fast and furious and good to see our pictures at the end of ride
6577,5,We visited the park today with two small children It was a lot of fun for them There are friendly employees everywhere so you can relax a little bit You have valet parking for the buggies D  We arrived by subway which was really comfortable If you will come by car you will get a discount when you purchase the tickets  Pricing is okay if you consider the efforts they make  Cheers
6578,4,The solution to cold winter entertainment Although some may find the rides dated the spinning teacup ride is interesting The platform tilts at an angle Balloon ride and bumper cars are top on my list Kids has fun and after which we went shopping All indoors
6579,4,The young children will love this place lots of kiddie rides to keep them entertained Be prepared to wait for at least 30mins for those popular rides I waited 70mins for the hot air balloon ride
6580,4,Visited with my friends on a rainy dayand as i know it is the worlds largest indoor museum  And the first site of the entire panorama inside it was like a huge colourful parka carnivala festival mountains fountains rails air ballooncartoons and much much more  The place is huge and trust me  you cant finish it in a day And it has everything what is required in an amusement park The indoor portion in mostly like a carnival going on and i thoroughly enjoyed the rides going through dark caves and water But the best part of it is the magic island which is in open area and the rides are extremely scary and not for faint hearted   Do dare to try to highest ride with drops you down like a free fall plus a round pendulum which oscillates and rotates doubling your scare and the bungee jump plus an extremely scary roller coaster  This place is fun beyond words 
6581,3,Lotte world is a huge theme park with both indoor and outdoor rides available for people from all ages My family and I were there in Dec 2014 with our tour group and it was our last attraction for the day that is to say we were there at night Its really pointless because it is too cold to take the outdoor rides and the indoor theme park is so packed The waiting time for all the indoor rides were too long and we do not have that much time to wait in line We did catch the parade at 8pm though
6582,5,Guiness book of record being the largest indoor theme parkAmusement parkisland with a lake and mono rail travelmalls everything looks a replica to Tokyo Disneyland to a extent A must to see if in Korea
6583,4,This place is a one spot centre for family with teen vacation the park was awesome though it quite tiring to explore the whole outdoor amusement game and it will for sure take a long queue in line for each of it but its so worth it best time to visit not in the winter because when i came in lotte world the weather is freezing cold We need to warm up most of the time at the warmer port they provided at the outdoor park For the inside park the ride its fun for the young children mostly less adrenaline ride
6584,4,I went here twice in December 2011 and January 2013 It was really great We spent the whole day day bcos there were indoor and outdoor rides For the pupillary rides make sure you go early and reserved a queue number That way you dont have to queue very long Its usually limited and only for certain rides The reservation is always located near the intended ride Try the gyro drop I think thats one of the popular onessorry but I chickened out Haha I came compared this park to everland cos Ive never been to the latter  anyway youll enjoy yourself Just avoid gg on oeak holidays
6585,5,Visited this place 4 years ago This is a must Visit place in Korea The amusement is very big and fun Games are very exciting and enjoyable I enjoyed all the rides there I hope to visit this place again in the future I strongly recommend this place to everyone going to Korea
6586,3,Although the theme park is an old friend and one I like to visit this time I went next door to the newly completed mall the tower is still under construction This shopping mall has been plagued by many problems about construction and dealines but is finally open to the public as of the middle of November 2014 Could some of the things I mention here be a part of the teething problems Probably and I hope they will be fixed before my next visit First of all I have to say that the architecture is splendid along the lines of making all customers believe they have entered a treasure cave Marble floors and pillars gilded bannisters and trims fairy lights  it all combines to turn the space into the inside of a glaring white disco ball I longed for some muted colors and corners someplace less white and gleaming and glaring but maybe thats just my personal taste What I can commend them on is adequate signage  everywhere you look are signs directing you to the subway lines the movie theatres the aquarium the shops the food courts etc There are also plenty of automated info screens that you can use to search for a place  and in plenty of languages Very touristfriendly But  no indications as to how far youll have to walk and believe me you will have to walk quite a way Also no indications about restrooms except one Most of the shops were still unpacking and setting up and those that were up and running had an eager air about them Im not sure what they are paying to rent space but Im sure it will be reflected in their prices As for spaces where a person can just sire down for a moment and rest before tackling the rest not in evidence Unless you enter a restaurant you are not going to catch your breath unless you sit on the floor If you have such a large space you need to provide such an amenity Is it worth a visit Yes possibly to visit the aquarium and the movie theatre Will it have stuff you cant find anywhere else Maybe but it doesnt look like it at this stage
6587,5,First time visiting sucha indoor theme park  watch running man  insist of going there to take a look  went during a off peak period queues for rides is quite short we used around 4 hrs to cover indoor  outdoor park
6588,4,This is a nice location for family with young ones It is relatively small in area compared to Disneyland and thus make it more enjoyable for children less than 10 years old It has various activity of attraction for the visitors and I could imagine children could enjoy it a lot It is however a little boring for adults
6589,2,The place is nice with great rides but only if you are patient enough to wait in the queue for an hour and a half per ride We felt like we are not getting much value for our money since we did not feel like spending the whole day standing in the queue In the evening some of the rides were closed even though the place was supposed to be open till late and for this reason the queues were equally long in the evenings Moreover you cannot leave the place and go shopping or do something else for a while and then go back your one day pass is not valid anymore if you leave the area There was no smoking area in the whole place
6590,4,Me and my girlfriend went there on a weekday afternoon when we wouldnt expecting such a long wait for some of the exceptionally popular rides thus we had to skip some of those ride  Price wise for both the indoor  outdoor magic world theme park are reasonable  Rides are suitable for both adult and children for the indoor theme park while the outdoor theme park cater more to the adult riders Overall experience for Lotte World is a good despite skipping some of the rides
6591,5,A good place to visit during summer since its indoors Rides are good for both adults and children Try to go early on a weekday as the lines can get really terrible later in the day so ride out the popular ones first
6592,4,bit pricey due to the long queues you can only get on a limited number of attractions in one day however the folk museum is brilliant dont miss it
6593,4,Suited more for family with kids with only limited ride for adults Do not go during the weekends  public holidays the crowd is massive FYI they give out discount when its rainy days Do have a look out
6594,5,I went here with my boyfriend We are in our mid 20s and Id say we really had fun We thought its only suitable for kids but they have rides for adults too There was a stage show for kids and food stalls for snacking Outside the amusement park is the mall If youre not into rides you can shop around while waiting for your group  We personally like the mini trick eye museum they have The place is very accessible We went there by KTX train It is great for spending some quality time with your family or special someone
6595,4,Located in the heart of the city Lotte World is exciting and thrilling theme park where you can enjoy rides an ice rink various kinds of parades folk museum a lake and much more At closing time if you are there you will watch a fantastic laser show Also there are shopping mall with restaurants and a theater for your fun
6596,5,We went in a group of 22 year old boys and even so we enjoyed ourselves greatly The outside section accommodates much more for older people with some rides only for adults The outside section is well set out with most rides a short wait 46 AUD for a days pass the park offers an enjoyable day out for all ages Highly recommended if wanting to find something to do whilst in Korea We went in the early afternoon around 12pm To save waittimes
6597,4,We went on a Saturday and the queues were very long Magic passes helped Would probably have enjoyed it more if there were shorter lines for the rides The big thrill rides were too brief for me and were over too soon Didnt bring kids with me this time but kids would really love this place Good food also
6598,4,We went there as it was known as the biggest indoor theme park the problem with theme parks is the long queues to get on the good rides
6599,4,It is a good theme park but for adrenaline junkies like me dont expect too much There are only 3 rides worth riding if you like thrill rides Even those 3 are alright only I mean they are fun but not as scary or thrilling If you have a low threshold for such rides it would be ideal  Overall its a nice theme park to relax at
6600,4,It was like Disney but smaller it was nice though Looks big in the picture but the area is small where all the games are cramped The weather is sunny and hot food and beverages is available Manage to brings souvenier home and other things we spend more time inside the building to cool off
6601,5,It was like Disney but smaller it was nice though I was a bit sick that day but was able to enjoy most of it
6602,4,It is one of the biggest theme park in the world in fact largest indoor theme parktheres also outdoor sectionIce skating and magic island connected to the indoor area by monorail Like to visit again with grand children
6603,5,My two sons aged 12 and 8 thenand i visited this amusement park in June 2010 It was only a couple of train stations away from our hotel so we ventured there with two guests from the same hotel The kids had a terrific time on the rides and the ice skating rink It is definitely a funfilled day if you have limited time in South Korea with your kids We went in the afternoon and paid 60 USD Kids paid half
6604,4,Didnt think it would more than a large state fair but its like Six Flags without worrying about the weather An indoor roller coaster that loops around the walk ways It was as much fun having the rollercoaster loop within 15 feet of you than it was riding it Recommend it for anyone stationed or visiting there
6605,4,Lotte World is kind of like a small Disneyland It has indoor activities as well as an outdoor Magic Island I went with a group of friends and had a blast I recommend going on a day where students are unavailable to go as there are long lines and waiting times for rides and go up to 2 hours long for teenagers and kids on school trips
6606,3,It was cool Not much to say but I found it interesting to go  hangout there for a day It was a total spur of the moment thing to do while visiting Seoul Def worth checking out
6607,2,The best part was going to the Folk Museum and the place with the optical illusion paintings It was so expensive and super crowded as well as hot inside was not air conditioned We only ended up going on only 23 rides because the lines were ridiculously long Perhaps younger children would find it more fun I dont think its worth the money or time Its not like Disneyland
6608,2,If you like queuing this is the place for you We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was way too busy  On the positive note the staff were really nice
6609,4,PLEASE NOTE I went in Feb 2013 but didnt write the review until Aug 2014wasnt able to select date in the area where I tell when I visited as too much time had passed since my visit  I wasnt sure what to expect of this placemy brother lives in Incheon and we were visiting him for a week and he wanted to take us there Partly because he wanted to go because he loves amusement parks but partly because he also wanted to show us the madness that is Lotte World As I said I wasnt sure what to expect so the closest thing I can describe it to is Camp SnoopyNickelodeon World at the Mall of America in Bloomington MNexcept that Lotte World has both indoor and outdoor attractions whereas CSNW is purely indoors The place was PACKEDI think we were there during a school break weekand the line for every ride was at least 3 hours long so I didnt ride anything but instead just walked around my dad and brother went on one ride while I sat and read a book drank a soda etc I can see how this would be entertaining for familieschildren who live in Seoul and this is as close to Disney as they can get All of the rides and characters were blatant ripoffs of Disney charactersattractions but that just added to the kitsch factor so I was entertained by it all  It was easy to find easy to buy tickets plenty of beveragefood options in the park Just dont expect to be blown away if you have been to Disney LandWorld alreadyits not the same But it is still entertaining and a fun place to peoplewatch at
6610,4,This indooroutdoor amusement park is quite pricey but if you came after 4 pm you can buy discounted ticket for 26000 won Indoor section is most likely for children but it can be fun for adults too While outdoor section is filled with some sorts of adrenaline pumping rides It also has a giant skating rink but you have to purchase different ticket from Lotte World ticket Lotte World is easily accessible via subway since one of the subway station exit is within Lotte Mall
6611,4,I would go straight up to magic island immediately for all the more exciting rides We wasted some time at the rides indoors The rides outside are much better
6612,3,Lotte World is a gentle and enjoyable experience Its a great place to stroll around hopefully catch a character parade or a show Its not an amusement park for those who have to have a lot of thrill rides even though there are some outside The rides are mostly pleasant here and the lineswaits are long I found the folk museum to be a highlight of my visit It was beautifully done and almost empty
6613,4,It was a pretty fun place to spend the day It is interesting to note that there are quite a lot of rides suitable for younger children We had enjoyed one of the fish ride and the other was dragon shooting We got there on a Wed It wasnt crowded thus we can try a lot if rides in a short span if timing  Enjoyed the hot air balloon ride which gave us a birds eye view of the park  We had lunch at Arirang Cafeteria in the park and we had enjoyed our food  There is also a mini Trickey museum in the park Pretty fun to visit it  Overall still a good place to visit especially if you have young children
6614,4,When search travel tipsguidelines in Seoul the Lotte World is always one of the mustgo attractions Its a good place to visit especially when you are with the family also a good choice for young couples  similar to Disneyland if not that big in scale Kids can spend hours here while adults if not interested in amusement park can go shopping in the Department Store in the same building
6615,5,I loved this place if you are adults go straight to the opened part or the park You will find many funny cool and even scared games But lines are every time weekdays too We came there around 3pm but it was enough to enjoy the most interesting attractions So you wont regret if you visit this park Enjoy
6616,3,My husband and I decided to visit Lotte World on our last day in Seoul We went on a Sunday in the late afternoon hoping to avoid bulk of the crowds This was not the case We were warned that it would be busy but with only Disneyland to compare to we underestimated how popular Lotte World would be The price of admission was fair about 25 per adult if I remember correctly GET A MAP  this place has so many levels and rides everywhere it would be easy to miss something without getting a free map at the info desk  We didnt get to go on too many rides as waits were were up to 2 hours on some of them The ones we did visit were great Well worth the money just to see the largest indoor amusement park in the world If I were to visit Seoul again I probably wouldnt go back to Lotte World unless it was in the middle of the week when crowds would be lessened The size and detail of the park is amazing but I only felt it was average for the waits and crowds even late on a Sunday Food selections are OK but not fantastic prices for souvenirs are less than they would be at comparable parks in the US
6617,3,very confusing disorganized and disappointing Most announcements and signs are not repeated in English some attractions include stories or set phrases well well never know There are a lot of games and attractions that are not included into 1 day pass it gets frustrating when you already get excited about going somewhere and it requires separate ticket line and payment A bit too much food places as well but it is understandable  food is everywhere anyway  All in all its worth seeing if you have some time and money to spend and arent much of adrenalin junkie The park had its own special features and has very nice and elaborate decorations
6618,3,The amount of couples that I saw here were unbelievable it is more a dating site more than anything There seemed to be a lot of school children there as well needless to say the place was packed and queues for the rides were at least 40 minutes each the more popular ones well over an hour I only had time to go on the Balloon Sky Ride which did give me a chance to take some nice pictures It is a pretty place and I think you should go for the sake of saying youve been there done that However one time is enough
6619,2,I have been here twicethe first time is quite exciting as I enjoyed riding all the thrilling gamesGyro DropAtlantis etcbut sadly I have to queue up more than 1 hour just to play 1 of those games Compared to others theme park this is not worth your time as you have to be patience enough just to play a game I went here just because it is famous in drama series like Stairway to Heaven Athena and variety show Running Man Second time I went here it was raining and I can only play indoor games In term of entrance fee it is pricey and not worth it Plus no more discount for foreigner Disappointing
6620,4,we visited this theme park on saturday and it was really crowded there was long queue but the location is in seoul and not too far for dongdaemun where i stayed i just tried 23 attraction watched the show this theme park is divided into outdoor and indoor areafor adrenalin junkies this theme park will be dissapointed because not too many thrilling rides most of them in outdoor area the interior is larger than the exterior and nicer you can buy ticket for admission ticket just for visit or day pass ticket you can try most of rides visit museum but you have to pay another ticket to visit pororo park or night time day pass ticket usually for foreigner there is discount ticket to visit this park just check the website for discount coupon or some visit korea website but you cant buy the ticket from machine if you want to use your discount coupon no need to queue if you buy ticket from machine this theme park is connected with mall hotel there is duty free in up floor ticket just for one visit only once you exit from the park you can go back except you buy another ticket
6621,5,I have no words to describe for this place This is the perfect place where you can bring your children and those teens or people in their early ages is also very suitable to this place 
6622,3,I guess it can be fun for the kids but not so much for adults I feel that the Pororo park is designed for kids below 5 years old We only realized after we paid and entered the area My 8yearold wanted to to go immediately after we entered the area I wish there was a sign outside which indicates that it is meant for smaller kids Please dont waste your money like us
6623,5,In the winter time or hot summer season you may feel difficult to go around outside even though you are in great theme park Lotte world has indoor theme park so we dont worry about the weather at all One thing you should consider before you go there Lotte world has super duper long queue in the most of timeso If you want to enjoy a ride something you better be prepared of long waiting
6624,3,I visited lotte world on a weekend and it was very much over crowed Not much rides are there for adults If you are visiting this place be prepared to spend at least 67 hrs as its quite big and has many floors
6625,3,We tried to visit Lotte World on a weekday hoping that the crowd size should be manageable but we were wrong The queue for each of the rides took at least an hour and we spent more than 70 of our time in Lotte a World queuing than enjoying the rides The carnival theme park atmosphere exuded fun Some of the thrilling rides did live up to my expectation If you are interested to visit Lotte World but be prepared to spend at least 8 hours with half the time queuing for rides
6626,3,Its crowded all the time and its a place where the kids are running around doing whatever they want I got a chance to go for free because of a card program my friend had so it was ok cause i didnt have to pay anything to get in The lines to go in are long and the rides are ok but they were doing alot of renovations and most of the things were closed off and no access granted to other things I was disappointed but we made the best of it There are alot of other places better to go than Lotte World try everland its alot better in my opinion
6627,3,Good combination of indoor and outdoor activities But the long queueing time and average thrill rides make this a rather old and tired attraction Have seen better rides in recent times and Lotte World seriously needs an upgrade  But the location is easily accesible from Jamsil station and provides a nice getaway for tourists who prefer not to take the long 2hour journey to Everland
6628,2,To be fair we went on a public holiday which is a definate mistake but the place was totally packed It was impossible to walk anywhere just to get through a door way took 5 minutes We queued for 3 hours for the balloon ride which was the only ride we managed to get on all day Every ride had queues of 23 hours The Magic Pass was fully booked by the time we arrived at 1000am I wonder at what point Lotte World Management should stop selling entry tickets  but I guess money speaks louder than patron enjoyment I think this is extremely poorly managed The place is a bit run down and the rides arent really anything we havent seen in Australia We went to Everland 2 days earlier and despite the travel distance and cold factor it is by far the better choice
6629,5,Came here as too cold to go Everland Super packed place qued 90 min for Ballon ride ha ha discovered had to stand on Ballon ride all energy drained standing Q so long for every ride Miss the outdoors as was too Cold to ride anything Jus took picures n ran back in OK place onlywould not come again as pretty expensive
6630,3,Be prepared to q for the rides  Average q time btw 30mins to an hr An Average theme  i would suggest heading to everland or even Seoul Park  less busy and kids get to spend more time on rides
6631,4,Lotte world has the largest indoor theme park and located in the heart of Seoul at Jamsil Station It has many attractions and rides as well but its always crowded even on weekdays I like the thrilling rides at the magic island outdoor theme park like the Gyro Drop Overall its fun and more suitable for younger children and teens I went to everland and Lotte world during my trip and I personally prefer Everland to Lotte world Not that Lotte world is bad but Everland cater to more ages If you visit my profile jacqsowhatblogspot  you will find more details about lotte world and everland xx
6632,2,It is indeed an indoor amusement park It is perhaps a quarter the size of Disney World We came here to try out their skating rink It looks great in photos but not so great once you are on it It is very busy during the weekend  The rink is on the lowest level and is best accessed from Lotte Mall The staff at the admission booths usually have poor English so will misdirect you unintentional The rink size is find Large oval shape with many entries from seating area for skaters which is separated from the nonskater seatings The rink is divided into three sections with cones This is well done with the outer ring for beginners and general public skating the secondary ring for skilled skaters and speed skaters The inner most section is for learn to skate classes only The quality of the ice rink is okay The outer ring is heavily used and even after resurfacing it still retains that bumpiness The secondary ring is smoother and nicer to skate on but all has a few bumps in it We were not in the inner section so cannot tell its surface quality The surface is quite a disappointment for skilled skaters The ice is soft and wet after resurfacing I think having a zamboni to resurface the ice would be remove the bumpiness but not the wetness  The rink has many restrictive rules that are not clear on their website Here are some examples   Children under the age of 6 are not permitted on the rink not necessary true What they really mean is children 120cm 311 are not permitted on the ice at anytime  Children ages 7 must be accompanied by an adult They really mean a child age 7 must have an adult with them whether she is a beginner or skilled skater The one child per adult is permitted but 2 or more children with one adult is not permitted  Hockey skates are not permitted at anytime What they mean is they wont allow any hockey skates on the ice to keep the skating speed lower So you can bring your own figure skates or speed skates to use along with gloves or mitts If you dont have skates you can rent them there The gloves and mitts is to ensure less bumps on the ice from beginners falling down and touching the ice Children all have to wear a helmet which is free to use and are in two large bins in the changing area If you forget to bring gloves or mitts you can purchase some from the skate sharpening shop  We will be searching for better rinks to try out next time
6633,5,As an American Serviceman stationed in Korea this place was a welcome refreshing break from my everyday duties My buddies and I would go down and experience this phenomenal Amusement Park If you are ever in Korea and want a great day of fun check this place out you wont be disappointed
6634,5,Lotte World is one of the most thrilling and unforgettable experience I could think of and relish I have been to almost all theme parks in India but my experience at Lotte World was whole new different Right from the entrance till the last ride available was breathtaking and awesome The Roller coaster Bungee drop  Giant loop was very frighteningly good but even better was the Gyro drop  Gyro spin which literally threw us to the lake nearby   I am pretty sure kids of all ages would definitely love the place and parents would have a hard time getting them back home ;  Unparalleled fun  excitement guaranteed
6635,3,This was a great place to go with friends if you are looking for some fun rides Watch for  specials Using a particular bank credit card can score you some savings
6636,3,Lotte world is nice theme park but not the best in my opinion Of course indoor part looks fancy and nice but its nothing to be wow for a lifetime There are many nice attactions and the staff is really friendly but going there is kind of tiring too I went there on a weekday and in the afternoon so it wasnt that crowded yet but we still waited 3050 minutes for each attraction Its not much at all some people are waiting for few hours during weekends Also use your discounts If you are subscriber on KakaoTalk or share their page on facebook you can get a bigger discount Because foreigner discounts are kinda funny  All in all I liked it there but I wouldnt go there again in a short period of time Maybe someday later
6637,5,Excellent location for fun for all ages A lot of events for all ages Normally very rush on weekends and most of the time is wasted in waiting Try visit other than weekends Metro station is in the basement Very easy to reach Enjoy
6638,4,We went on Thursday It was not too crowded We took family rides However it gets crowded during the evenings because of evening only tickets
6639,5,Went to Lotte World with a friend during a weekend To get there just take the metro to Jamsil It was crowded and there was party atmosphere everywhere The place is loaded with cartoon characters and there are live performance shows everywhere  The roller coaster is a musttake ride here Also dont miss the Flume ride and Gyro drop I felt the Gyro Drop is the best attraction in Lotte World
6640,4,Must visit if you go to Korea with young children and toddler unlike many other amusement park theres a lot of rides that my 7 and 2 year old can enjoy mostly without even queueing yay Most rides are indoor but dont miss the outdoor Magic island rides which provides more options for older children and adult  The Pororo Park on the basement same floor with the ice skating ring provides a special place where toddler can run around freely and enjoy rides designed for their early age The fact that they limit 2 hours per visitor makes it even better as they get to enjoy most rides without even queueing Too bad pororo and all their friend does not come in live and do their dancing very often got to see only eddy and crong and my toddler is a bit disappointed
6641,5,If you are visiting Seoul Lotte World is a must place that you want to visit There you can can spend full day with a wonderful thrilling rides and theater plus nice facilities
6642,4,Ive been here with my family Due to lack of time I only bought ticket after 4pm It is cheaper For me Lotte World is similar to Genting Highland but much better If you compare Lotte World with Disneyland you will choose Disneyland as a winner There have a parade here But most of the mascot is Aladdin etc
6643,3,Admission price is quite pricy need to buy tickets each time you ride so it can be cheaper to purchase 1 day passif you have little kids they will enjoy this magical world but can really be boring for adultSpend half a day here only This atrraction has direct access to green line subwayeasy to lcate and connected to lotte dept storeWord of adviceremember the entrance we spent 30 minutes jst to find the exit not much sign around
6644,3,Lottee world is prett much or tollers for people who dont like rough rides and for couples you see lots of couples there this theme park is indoor and outdoor There is a musum at the 3rd floor and its HUDGE I can spend the whole day there and go around insted of just going to the boring rides Everland is way better
6645,5,My husband and I went here by ourselves 37yrs old and loved it Lots of it was very young but was still great to be around What a fantastic amusement park Like nothing I have seen before Worth every cent of the entry fee My husband loved the museum It was very interesting and great for the adults to kill some time while the kids play Although it is great for the kids too I just loved seeing the kids having a ball The ice rink in the centre of the ground floor was awesome we watched loads of little kids getting their skating lessons We got a suprise at night when the laser show started We had no idea it was coming and there were pyrotechnics a huge screen telling a story and massive flames around the centre and of course we had no idea we were standing right next to one and got the fright of our lives The outdoor part was fantastic We went outside at night time so some things were closed but still great Live bands; the list just goes on and on This place is fantastic and I highly recommend it The variety of activities to do is endless Let your inner child out and have a ball We never made it to all the shops but they looked great You can easily spend a whole day here We chose to stay at the IBIS Seoul Ambassador nearby and caught a taxi to Lotte world and back If I know anyone going to South Korea I always recommed this place as a MUST
6646,4,If you want to stay coolnot bothered by the weathher while playing around on the ridesthis is a good choice It has indoor and outdoor areasquite interesting theme park throw in a show about KPop  Kwavearound the world street paradeand all the good ole rides yepu got it all under one roof and its quite in the heart of Seoul
6647,4,My family  i have been to some big themeamusement parks and i find that Lotte World is another dreamland for kids Initially we wanted to go to Everland but given the time constraint we opted for Lotte World instead Most of its attractions are indoor pity that we didnt try outdoor as we spent too much time inside Even spent half day inside we still didnt manage to cover most of the indoor attractions due to queuing for some rides Lucky that we went on Monday where queues were not too long I had so much fun riding the rides with my little nephew and to see that he enjoyed so much he refused to leave There is a nice parade show twice a day but we missed the garden show  laser show Suggest to spend one full day if intend to visit Lotte World
6648,4,I been here more than 10 time and i still love it come during Spring time which is April  May you will have beautiful view over the lake side
6649,4,The facilities there is quite numerous therefore there is never a dull moment there if u go in the morning you never can tell when it is evening
6650,3,Id suggest anyone everyone to just head to Everland if you have a day to spare in a theme park Me and my friends we spent the whole day in Everland without getting bored and amazed but it was purely zzz throughout our stay at Lotte World Its small and theres nothing much to see Just felt that Lotte is overrated Everland is just so much better okay it took us hours to get to Everland from Seoul so I guess if you want convenience Lotte World will be a better choice Spent not more than 4 hours in Lotte World before we head out haha If I didnt remember wrongly the ticket was cheaper than Everland though And they gave us student price despite us being foreigners and we did not have student pass with us and some meal voucher which we exchanged for a free meal yay Haha so we didnt felt that bad afterall
6651,3,Lotte World is a place where dreams go to die and are reborn in mediocre rides and junk food The lines are long but the peoplewatching is fantastic I kept expecting the indoor part of the park to start falling apart at any minute  My wife and I were there for an entire day Our first ride was Sinbad  a subtle and horrific hattip to Disneys Pirates of the Caribbean ride It was fantastically awful and when I was finally splashed by the water I expected it to burn through my clothes Our second attraction was an insectrain forest mashup that featured lots of empty insect viewing cages and many children that perhaps should have been in some of those cages Then we ventured outdoors for the real fun  Of waiting in line for 2 hours for Atlantis Actually a pretty good roller coaster  the ride consists of going in and out of a manmade mountain and has two main runs Again not bad However the other rides all 8 or so of them all had very long lines and we were getting cold so we ventured back inside  Our finale consisted of a teacup inspired ride that had a large cobra in the middle and revolved just quick enough to entice the junk food our of your stomach Not bad but perhaps a ride to be taken earlier in the day before food consumption  Many of the indoor attractions and rides cost a little extra  This is a genuine piece of Korea and while many foreigners might scoff at the rides and general condition of the place the peoplewatching is superb
6652,3,This is just an average indoor theme park Most of the rides are basic and had long queues Cost wise it is higher Quite a few things needs to be streamlined for a better experience  a more and good signages at many places; b better queue management by site administration; c more and affordable options for eatables;  All in all its a place with too many rides packed into a small area which though appears and feels good needs to provide a planned tour for the visitors
6653,5,Im from Florida so its important to note that this does not compare to Florida amusement parks but I still think that this was a great experience It had never been on an inside ride before so that was a novelty The inside water ride wasnt actually that bad but you will get wet Outside is the place to be for the roller coasters The Gyro Swing was great but if you have motion sickness its not for you The bumper cars are awesomeThe Atlantic Adventure is a proper coaster but be prepared for a really long line If you can definitely go on a week day I had a really unique and fun experience Make sure to look online for discounts for foreigners couples or for a night pass
6654,5,Lotte World is an annual Christmas tradition for us and a place we take visitors who drop by Much of the area is free but the section with requires an admission fee Indoor roller coasters flume rides tunnels and many shows The Christmas Parade is special
6655,3,regular tourist theme park with indoor and outdoorsuper long queues for almost everything including food even though we had lunch at 3pm which by right lunch rush hour should be gone Ull need to spend the whole day there to play most of the rides and explore the mall etc theres a avenue of stars beside though
6656,3,I was at Lotte World after 4pm following a tour package on 16 December with my 10 year old kid As it was cold outdoor we stayed at the indoor themepark area Most rides which we wanted to go for like 4D theater and Bumper Car were all closed for maintenance We queued 30 minutes for the monorail only to realise that it circles the indoor area only not the indoor and outdoor area as we expected The hotair balloon ride queue was so long that it says 60 minutes wait so we did not attempt to queue for it  We wanted fast food fried chicken for dinner and were told that we had to wait for 30 minutes for the chicken to be ready  Maybe because it was a Sunday night it was way too crowded long queues for minimal attractions that were open indoor and long queues for food Spent 4 hours there but didnt seemed to have accomplished much except doing the Singbad ride Desperado cowboy shooting monorail watched 7pm parade and had fastfood dinner  The parade was the only more interesting event with a Christmas mood
6657,4,I visited this place twice Once 3 years ago and another in 3 days ago In both trips nothing much changes except for the weather  The entire amusement park comprises of both indoor and outdoor areas both have great mixture of ridesattractions for young kids teenager or adults that are young at heart  Food are easily available around though I hope that there are a greater variety for fast food This is very important because of the terrible queues that plague every theme park One can save plenty of time if he queue and eat at the same time  The entire place is quite compact but yet spacious enough to avoid being claustrophobic So one do not need to travel vast distances to get from one point of a park to another
6658,4,Lotte World is relatively cheap to get in we got tickets for 29000 won each You do need to pay for a few rides inside but we felt that was ok The rides on Magic Island were great the Gyro Drop was terrifying  Inside the balloon ride was lovely we did have to queue for an hour for it though The French Revolution roller coaster was incredible also an hour queue though  The Christmas parade was one of the best things I have ever seen A very weird take on Christmas and it was so good I got a bit teary The actors were amazing and very friendly It must be such a brilliant job  Only issues we had were the queue lengths and as we are vegetarian the food Ye gods dont remind me of the food  Brilliant day out though we had so much fun
6659,5,I spent a great day in Lotte world with my friend  from 4 pm till 10 pm we really enjoyed the different adventures there specially Gero swing Atlants Ice skating and the amazing international performances on the Garden stage I hope to can visit it again D
6660,3,Wow Lotte World is expensive I only went to the amusement park area and went with a few kids but the stuffy indoor air and limited number of rides didnt quite do it for me Now if you are looking for an indoor place to kill a few hours it does the trick  but I dont think Ill be returning here unless I have to On the plus side at least the food options were not totally overpriced
6661,4,Overall A nice experience within a stones throw of the hotel in downtown Seoul  Liked Best Lots of rides for young children Lines moved fasterwere shorter than Everland which was a surprise on the day we went since the park is literally in the city Park layout had the bigger rides for older kids in the adjoining Adventure Magic Island so there is less walking from ride to ride  Liked Least 1 Cost inside is high for what is available 2 Some attractions inside are still extra cost even with the all inclusive ticket  Tips 1 There are fast passess to use for the popular rides 2 Food is expensive and limited in scope inside  there is a food court just outside Lotte World in the connected mall ie hamburgers tacos if you need a lower price optionbut need to ask for reentry
6662,4,If you are travelling with young kids or teenagers a day out at the Lotte World with the family should prove to be decently good entertainment and fun for all
6663,2,2102012  Every single ride inside Lotte World is minimum wait time of 4060mins The worst experience ever  We tried to get on board of the floating balloon to get a glimpse of whole indoor Lottery World we have to wait close to 2hrs Most of the time got wasted in the queue  Theme park in Korea I strongly recommended Everland in Yongin area It huge and lots of attractions all ages can played and more better value than money  Every patrons were so exhausted tired and very disappointed with the service  WILL
6664,5,It was very fun there are lots of games and shops and food it was really nice had a great time there but the waiting time for the game is quite long so we did not get to play all the games that we want to play
6665,4,went there with my bf it was fun  the rides are cool what i like the most is the skating ring inside the big mall and the hot air balloon rides attached at the ceiling of mall
6666,4,Lotte World is large thame park either indoor or out door for kids  teens included aldult to have to have fun  release tensionThe entrance fees is around 40000 thousand WonIt takes full days to complete all games fun and show when we visitWe can take ballon ride ship swing train ride and others indoor  out door gamesIf we are lucky our kids can see mickey mouse show Consider dont miss to visit this enjoyable place  do some shopping although we need to spend our money but it worth for the value
6667,4,To my juniors in their twenties this is one of their Adventurous Parks theyre keen to explore n try out most of the thrills it offers such as the Bungee Drop Gyro Swing Gyro Drop Flume Ride etc This Park caters rides for all ages On the safety side age limit to be observed on some heartstopping rides Within this megacomplex are dutyfree shops departmental stores sports complex  a skating rink Rio Samba Festival to enjoy its unique Summer Vacation in the months of June to August Hope my review can provide you good pointers for your next holiday plan Thanks for reading 
6668,3,The best part was the price I went in the afternoon and it was cheaper plus my bank card gave me another 40 off Lotte World is small and the lines are super long There was only one good ride and we had to wait about four hours to ride it The name is called Atlantis and it does rock If you want an all day theme park then Everland is more worth your money
6669,4,during my visit to Korea i have visitted this place twice it is great place to treat the child inside of you great rides at 7pm they have amzing parade in indoor side of the world and if you need a deal they have better rates in the afternoon Dont miss the star avenue they have great audio rooms you can put your voice over your favorit dramas
6670,4,Liked  the rides of course and the ambience of the park Disliked  the lack of information in English as we like to find our own way around
6671,2,It is like walmart huge and has lot of stuff Customer services is excellent since 1 staff 1 alley Must go to the bakery and food section Great taste for sampling there Then for other itemsSave the money for the airport duty free on your last day It sound rare but u know what I mean once you been in Seoul This is the insider known secret
6672,3,We have decided to go here and though the queue was really long we waited patiently and try to get into the rides anywhere possible There are some many people so you have to be patient a bit The entrance fee paid kind of wasted since the outdoor park was closed due to rain But compared to the ride I enjoyed visiting the Folk Museum inside the Lotte World it was interesting at least for me
6673,4,The lady at the counter encouraged us to get the express ticket which we did But somehow we couldnt use it inside for most of the rides So I felt like we paid extra for nothing  We only tried the outdoor rides as the indoor one was really crowded However we caught the Peterpan show and my son loves it The characters actually come down from the stage to pose for pictures with you and shake hands etc that was lovely  My 4 year old son enjoyed himself at the amusement park and that alone makes the tickets and queues worth it 
6674,4,It was something different and my kids had lots of fun Its just next to our hotel Lotte World Hotel
6675,4,During our stay it was raining so this place was great for entertaining the kids It is easy to get to Just take the subway to Jamsil station and the entrance is inside before you exit the station They have several rides inside and outside Some of them are copies of Disneyland rides such as Pirates of the Caribbean and Indiana Jones with a completely different theme There was also a parade with large floats that looked very Disney The inside park also has a large skating rink Outside they have a big Cinderellas castle and rides which were closed during the rain This amusement park is great for kids but for adults there are more authentic things to do in Seul
6676,4,Good place to visit if traveling with young children My kids enjoyed it although it was offseason so a few of the big rides were closed We spent a day at the amusement park and then in the Lotte Department Store nextdoor If you go to Lotte World take a walk through the food court at the department store before you leave Wow
6677,4,Try the Hot air balloon ride for full view of the park The indoor and outdoor games were soooo scary the 360 degree rollercoastergiant drop etc ; The entrance fee will be much cheaper after 4 pm and youll get discount if you show your travel passportvisa
6678,4,Had a spare afternoon on a chilly Seoul afternoon so my girlfriend and I checked out Lotte World and had a ball I didnt know what to expect from the place thought it would be a cheap Disneyland knock off but had a great time on the indoor roller coaster and other indoor rides flume ride adventure rides as well as the big rides out on the island  So if you do have a spare 5 hours and are in the mood for some good old fashioned amusement park fun Lotte world is worth a look
6679,5,Despite the odd overgreetings from the staffs the place is fun and the indoor area is huge The end of the day light show is awesome You must try The Atlantis Adventure Comet Express and French Revolution We had so much fun we went on to them 3 times Be prepare to stay the full day to enjoy it we were exhausted at the end of the day almost 11pm when we walk out but it was fun fun fun
6680,5,A great place to become a kid again for one day Went here for one of my friends Birthdays what an awesome way to spend the day with a bunch of friends  Does not even feel like you are in a massive city 
6681,5,OK this may sound a bit childish but this is actually one of favorite places in Seoul This place is hilarious It makes you feel as if youve gone back to your childhood Here are the tips and what I think about this place in general  1 Make sure you visit during the parade time Beautiful people in fancy costumes will parade in the tune of cheerful music and that is quite something to see  2 If you enjoy skating there is a ice skating rink in the middle  3 The foods and beverages sold inside are of OK quality and are reasonably priced If you opt for better food you would have to go out but still inside the building and right outside the indoor entrance and look for Spaghettia  my favorite past franchise  4 Lotte World is connected to Sukchon Lake where you can take a walk Lotte Dept Store Lotte Hotel Lotte Mart and Lotte Cinema There are also a big Apple Computer Shop and ToysAreUs which add fun  Enjoy
6682,3,It is a good disney miniature but you wont be able to imagine how fully packed is this place during school holiday You will spend time only to queue
6683,4,Lots of fun in a compact venue with some great rides In winter you are limited to the inside which is a shame because all the fun is outside There are some great rides that are all very close together and queues are manageable You can also get reservations to come back at a set time and save yourself from a long wait in exchange for a short one still maybe 1015 minutes Lots of fun for all ages
6684,3,It went over the weekend and it was fun The rides are fun but dont go in with big expectations because you will be disappointment I was able to be entertained the whole day but one visit is definitely enough Cool iceskating rink inside
6685,4,Lotte World gets very crowded in the afternoon after school gets out and on the weekend Its best to go early in the morning It isnt that impressive compared to amusement parks in the other countries but it is ok for a few hours If you have more time go to Everland which about an hour outside of Seoul but even that cant compare to amusement parks in other countries
6686,4,The folk village was closed when we got there around 7pm so my advice is to visit the folk village first before going to other attractions The rides were fun but not extremely special Our favorite one was the Atlantis which was a pretty special roller coaster It was winter and VERY cold so be prepared Overall the rides were pretty good but not special enough to make a trip there if you dont have too much time in Seoul
6687,5,Glad that part of amusement park was indoors as it was minus 5 outside Many rides for young kids The indoor playground with the air guns was a highlight It was empty in the morning but got very crowded after noon The entertainment show and parade were similar to Disneyland Ticket price was reasonable
6688,4,Perfect place to go with the family If you have kids this is one place you should consider taking them Those with young kids take them to Kidzania as well which is a short walk away
6689,2,If youre looking for Disneyland youll be disappointed
6690,4,I love it you can be able to enjoy the inside and outside view of Lotte World Its situated inside the mall and its very grand reminds of Disneyland  the rate is very affordable
6691,5,Huge shopping center plus theme park It is a great place to visit with or without kids
6692,5,This theme park is cleverly designed Dont be misled by the size it offers everything from simple to thrilling rides I have one kid who refused to take any thrilling rides n another who r dying for all the thrilling rides So we have to split into 2 gps n we thoroughly enjoyed the park I like the monotrail which lead you from the indoor to th eoutdoor themepark this offers u a gd overall view when u do not want to step out in the cold additional the staff at the entrance was very helpful to tourist Our hotel rm was only reday at 1pm and we enter the park at abt 11am They made some arrangement for us so that we could re enter the park with ease It was so fun that we only leave the park at 4pm and chk in our hotel rm then we came back in the evening again to continue teh rides additionally u can get discounted ticket if u stay at lotte world hotel
6693,4,I always wanted to go there since watching Stairways to Heaven I also want to go to theme parks Do not go there during holidays and weekends Wear comfortable clothes and shoes
6694,4,Big mall but best for sports and adventure goods Clothes collection are good but expensive in coparison to Thailand or Singapore
6695,5,They have a really good mix of rides here Perfect for my son who has been there a couple of times since he was 15 year and last time he was 25 and he really loves it Very friendly staff and outside you can do some ice skating and there is plenty of places to eat at
6696,5,Was better than i had expected reasonable food prices and lines that actually move were nice surprises
6697,5,Bring your credit card to shop here or just window shop Great place to people watch
6698,5,i and mom can enjoyed to see She sit on wheelchair look around more childen player in lotte worldShe enjoyed shopping cosmetic shop in side lotte world 
6699,3,if you like to shp till you drop this is a must Other than that the authentic markets are nicer Dontget lost 
6700,5, After lunch at Mazesoba I went to Giordano then to Jo Malone and for dinner I went to Broxi and ate a burger 
6701,5, There is a lot to see and frequent I happened to stop by Gordon Ramsay Burger because there was no line but at a very wicked price the taste is okay More surprising than a hamburger is a Coke of 5000 won lol 
6702,5,Amazing Must see
6703,5, The Lotte Tower Observatory is the best Even on a cloudy day you can see Seoul at a glance There are several tourist attractions so it is worth visiting the observatory 
6704,3, Visited the day after the Gangnam area was flooded Something wasnt what I expected 
6705,5,Very nice view
6706,5,Breathtaking views
6707,5,Seoul is soul of asia 
6708,5,Without expectation will be good to visit If expect too much not sure I think if visit weekday will be better as this place is too crowded
6709,1, Hmm very disappointing There isnt much to see Each person may feel differently but there is no theme suitable for Seoul Sky and its in the middle 
6710,5,Amazing By far the best observation tower I have ever gone up The views of Seoul were breathtaking Very spacious at the top and somehow we spent more than an hour up there If you want to have dinner at the very top around 50000 per person make sure you make a reservation in advance
6711,4, It was hard to find the place I wanted The first visit felt like wandering through a maze as the space was very spacious and the escalator and elevator connections were not easy The Seoul view from Sky was 
6712,1,Seeing many people waiting for the  elevator  was   one i hate  and  without no seeing anything   from inside the elevator made me  unhappy and all the time that I being  forced to look up the celling creating various colorful lighting show 
6713,5, The view of Seoul from the observatory is the best The windows also seem to be well maintained and the indoor lighting is not too much so there is no difficulty in taking night shots 
6714,5,High end luxury brands
6715,4, Shopping sights food entertainment allpurpose tower with just one shot 
6716,5, Even though I live nearby Im not interested so I didnt go there but I got a discount ticket so I went Its full of apartments around The feeling of seeing from a high place seems to be different from Namsan 
6717,4, I go once twice wellj 
6718,4, Parking is a bit inconvenient but Sky Lounge is scary and fun 
6719,5,The most beautiful view in all of Seoul
6720,5, An indescribable experience A great view and distant view The ride in the elevator was an experience 
6721,2, The things I didnt like were that the restaurant did not have a parking discount the toilet was dirty and the interior was hot The good things are the delicious cheesecake the Lotte Cinema Sound Bread and 
6722,5,Worth it  The fifth highest building in the world  Amazing view  A thrill ride from beginning to end  This is what I call a birds eye view If you arent afraid of heights than youll love it
6723,5,Must go place
6724,5, There are so many things to enjoy inside When you get off at Jamsil Station everything is connected 
6725,5, 30 minutes until ticket confirmation Additional 40 minutes to the elevator Only people with strong legs go 
6726,5, As expected Lotte World Tower Aquarium and observatory are worth visiting 
6727,3,Quite expensive To get there u have to wait almost 1 hour To go down maybe much longer
6728,5, South Korea is development innovation scientific breakthroughs modern style in all areas of life Admire Korea 
6729,5,Very good place
6730,5,Its a very tall tower with a great view
6731,5,Great view up there
6732,4,Its really awesome
6733,5, There are restaurants and cultural spaces so its a great way to pass the time  
6734,5, Ill be arriving in Seoul soon and I want to climb to the top of Lotte Tower 
6735,5, Its the World Tower I often go to to watch movies There are plenty of places to eat and to see Its a great place to spend a lot of time 
6736,5, Seoul looks amazing from a height of 555 meters on the 123rd floor  
6737,3, The terrace was nothing like I expected If there was a landmark it would have been fun to look around Its not fun to watch 
6738,5, A place you must visit at least once The night view is amazing 
6739,5,Very good location to come and see Seoul  Need to pick good weather
6740,5,amazing view
6741,5,So many things to see and reasonably priced  One heck of a view
6742,5,Really cool views of the city and the elevator is the fastest in the world
6743,1, Visited on July 29th never visited twice not much to enjoy 
6744,5, I really liked the aquarium I visited with my daughter and family 
6745,5, As it is the tallest building in Korea it can be seen from afar and if you take the elevator to the observatory it takes about a minute to go up 
6746,5, There is no free way to park and the discount is limited but its fun for 2 days 
6747,3, It took a long time to wait but I decided to go just to see the scenery 
6748,5,Very Fancy place
6749,5,Crystal mirrors are in roof floor
6750,5,Superb views
6751,4, I love all of the luxury hall duty free shops restaurants and cafes The luxury store and department store staff seem to be more friendly than other 
6752,5, Dont miss it Jump on Sky Bridge 555 meters above Lotte Sky Tower Dont miss out on special events If you come to Korea you have to jump at the 
6753,5, The entrance to the observation deck is well decorated The show is fantastic As if to prove that it is the tallest observatory in Korea climbing on the 
6754,4, very nice parking is expensive 
6755,5, There is a lot to see and the traffic is good but it is good for mental health to give up food because the wait is too long 
6756,4,xngxdxxi
6757,5, The facility is very good and it is good for a shopping date 
6758,5, A visit to the skyscraper seems to be a good memory at least once And on the weekends there are a lot of people so weekdays would be better 
6759,4, Ive only looked around part of it but its so wide that itll take a while to look around 
6760,5,The view from the top is amazing I was excited to be at the top of South Koreas tallest building The entry to the tower is also an awesome experience I liked the way they 
6761,5, Coffee prices at the top floor cafe are relatively cheap 
6762,5, The walking tour from the 117th to the 123rd floor was very interesting and pleasant 
6763,5, The view was great and there were so many things to see I experienced a new world 
6764,1, In any case a novice Rolex Cartier 
6765,2, Very dissatisfied with the parking fee If youve seen the movie you should get a full discount for 3 hours What are you doing with a 3000 won discount 
6766,5,Fantastic to see the whole city
6767,1, A view of Seokchon Lake and Lotte World I went to Kim Youngmos Bakery Cafe which has a very nice view 
6768,5, A tower worth visiting at least once if you live in Seoul Lounge food is really neat and delicious The pasta came out last and I took it and took a picture The taste of the food was soso overall for the price The 
6769,5, A place worth visiting at least once I went just before nightfall so I was able to see both the light and the dark side The cafe is a franchise so it wasnt expensive It is the same as the market price 
6770,5, If you feel sick while passing by go to the bathroom here 
6771,3,Great views Bit pricey If youre paying with a visa its 20 of the ticket
6772,5,The biggest shopping mall in Korea
6773,5,Great experience good parking food available
6774,5, In July 2022 the entry ticket is KRW 90K Quite expensive but comparable to the facilities with a very fast and comfortable elevator 
6775,4, It was good except for the expensive one You can get a discount if you bring your Samsung card 
6776,5,Very cool multilevel experience The elevator ride is worth the price of admission Do not miss
6777,5,GreatI wish I had courage to try the bridge
6778,5,Luxury and diverse mall
6779,5,Great to do ABSOLUTELY
6780,4, Its not as big as I thought so Im disappointed Expensive for its size 
6781,5,The best view of Seoul
6782,5, I went to see a movie Usually it only lingers in the basement but after a while I went upstairs After all Jamsil is Lotte World Chunji 
6783,5,Good place to visit with yr kids
6784,4, Its been a long time since Ive been to a place change a lot 
6785,5, As a tower representing Korea it is a wonderful and beautiful place 
6786,4, Use the restaurant Stay on the 81st floor A place with a view overlooking the surrounding area The food quality is good but considering the price its hard to say its 
6787,5, The view was also very good I love both the bedroom and bathroom The wine bar was good and the breakfast was good too 
6788,5, Its so good to go with my baby But I went with my baby and wife but I went to the aquarium 
6789,5, Observation Deck Be sure to go up 
6790,5, It is a place where families are satisfied Jamsil is like a second home because I feel comfortable 
6791,5, special case sale Price is not convenient 
6792,5, Great place to eat and play There is a long wait at the restaurant on weekends 
6793,5, Hanwoori Shabu Shabu Kalguksu is delicious but its cheap 
6794,5,A very nice mallGreat cafes plenty restaurants and shopping possibilities The aquarium was a very pleasent surprise Worth a couple of hours The tower and the Lotte World Park is on the to do list Strolling along the lakes behind the 
6795,4, outing with friends I had a good look 
6796,4, Its like visiting the landmarks of each country when you go abroad Korea can be indifferent but still worth a visit 
6797,5, Visit Seoul Sky Great spot Pleasant visit 
6798,5,Great
6799,5,An incredible view
6800,4, 4D is less realistic Everything else is satisfactory 
6801,5,Excellent but too crowded
6802,5,Super
6803,5, Its so wide that my legs hurt and I have to be prepared to line up anywhere at mealtime 
6804,4, Stayed for 12 nights at Signiel The guard on the first floor does not allow you to take pictures 
6805,5,Fun
6806,5,Its a must to see Tip Talk to the assistant and ask to do discount on tickets Its easier when you are in even a small 3 people group
6807,5, Signiel Hotel Lounge Good to drink tea or coffee while looking at the scenery 
6808,5, My personal opinion is that its worth a visit The view from the observation deck on the top floor was good 
6809,4,A very popular tourist spot these days
6810,5, It is the largest shopping mall in Jamsil There are many places where people of all ages can visit and experience 
6811,5,Good
6812,2, Optimal food for money This is a place for a specific person 
6813,5,Home to GORDON RAMSAY BURGER the sky tower thing and many shops
6814,3, I cant eat because there are so many people on the weekend 
6815,5,Yesterday was my first time visiting seoul and lotte towerbest experience of my lifeand that too with new friends You should visit lotte tower onceyou will feel like u r on top of the JUST AMAZING
6816,5, Lotte Tower  If you make a lunch set the purchase ticket for that day will be cheaper  The place where the floor is glass is thrilling and fun  
6817,3, The view of the hotel is good but the swimming pool is small and there is not much to eat in the morning 
6818,5, I went shopping and ate You can also take a walk around Seokchon Lake 
6819,5, Very expensive but for such a view you can pay that Very expensive but you get such a view dont miss it 
6820,4,Split in two worlds one for the rich and the other for everyone else Enjoyable experience with lots to see 
6821,5, There are so many different things that I can play all day 
6822,5, Its been a while since Ive visited but a lot has changed 
6823,5, Koreas Landmark Lotte World Tower I want foreigners to see it when they come to Korea 
6824,3, Once the parking fee is paid food is expensive and if you are going to buy luxury goods it would be better to buy it here 
6825,5, The observatory is nice but its okay to eat shaved ice on the 79th floor and watch 
6826,4,Fast track tickets are very useful
6827,5,Have many shops to enjoy Also have nice restaurants Clean and easy to access public transportation It has aquarium that well maintained
6828,5,Recommend once visiting Seems over hyped Ticket seems bit expensive
6829,4, Cool suitable for sights deducted one star because of Mano 
6830,5,SO BEAUTIFUL
6831,5, The height of the 220story building is 555m making you feel dizzy when looking down 
6832,5, If you travel to Korea you definitely have to visit the Lotte World Tower  
6833,4, As it is the largest in the country there were many people 
6834,5, Nice view a bit scrambled everything but its worth visiting I wanted to take the experience of crossing the bridge but it was closed 
6835,5, Because I can see the city of Seoul I love it 
6836,5,Always an experience Massive Loads of people around Very convenient
6837,5,nice  tower
6838,5, Things to do things to do rest area food nothing is missing 
6839,5,Amazing
6840,5, Lotte World Tower is still luxurious and wonderful even after visiting again after 3 years You can go up to the highest floor by elevator in 1 minute and the view of downtown Seoul from the outdoor terrace is truly 
6841,5,Great engineering marvel similar to the New York WTC It has 125floors and the lift takes you in a minute there Entry fee is applicable which is not that expensive Lots of branded shops and restaurants Very well maintained
6842,4,This place is so huge an theres so much to see  They have all the high end name brand stores Everything is beautifully elegant
6843,2,Je me demande bien pourquoi ils ouvrent quand il ne fait pas beau Je ne pensais pas que la vue pouvait tre si bouche mais eux le savent et continuent de faire payer le billet 20 000 pour ne rien voir du tout
6844,4,Very small and filled with 12h long queues of people for each ride where one ride takes about 30s to 1min so in case of visiting its better to pay extra for vip entrance not to waste time waiting in the qq
6845,5,Spectacular tower and views from the top
6846,5,Tienda departamental impresionante aunque sea de pasada hay que entrar
6847,5,Tasurotlar mazza Ayniqsa lift juda tez
6848,5,Beautiful views
6849,4,Lotte World has improved over the last decade It is no longer like an old mall but has been renovated to current sophistication
6850,5, expensive But everything is there A modern version of the saying that there is nothing Lots of restaurants Good for a date good for shopping good for family and good for things to do However the overall price 
6851,4,Saw Tom Cruise  Love him
6852,5,Great views of the city If you go at dusk youll see both day and night views
6853,5,Once in a lifetime kind of experience
6854,4, I think it would be better to go on a day when the weather is nice 
6855,5,Was a once in a lifetime experience going on the  Sky bridge We felt safe and secure the entire time Would highly recommend this
6856,5, I thought it would be the same as the scenery I saw right away at the hotel but it was better 
6857,4,Costo biglietto per gli adulti un po alto ma ne vale la pena
6858,5, There is an observatory or an aquarium in addition to watching a movie eating a meal and I often go to the World Tower itself rather than an amusement park 
6859,5, Lotte World Nogu Tower Shopping was good I used to drink a lot of rice 
6860,5,goooood
6861,5,Lindoooo
6862,4,Its very VERY big Got lost multiple times trying to navigate from the theme park to the mall to the department store However the staff everywhere are friendly and helpful The department store itself is very extensive but I mostly 
6863,5, Today we had an Art Q event on the 76th floor Viewa Art The 76th floor can only be accessed through the lobby of the Seoul Hotel 
6864,5,Awesome experience and obviously best views of the city Also very well organized and easy to get to the top
6865,5,Its a well thought design and most beautiful building Its wow and the experience was amazing I would not mind for the second visit
6866,4, I visited with my family during the holidays Currently as we are doing an exhibition related to whales you cannot enter immediately but you can enter after seeing the exhibition underground 
6867,5,We stayed at Signiel hotel 90th floor in Lotte Tower Its awesome view Totally worth it
6868,5, Anywhere in the world the observatory is worth a visit If you make a reservation in advance it is cheaper and you can enter directly with the QR 
6869,5, It was very overcast due to the fine dust in China but I recommend visiting on a sunny day 
6870,5,DO IT so fing amazing and breathtaking
6871,3, It is not recommended to visit when it is raining or cloudy In clear weather you can even see Incheon It would be nice if the movement guide was a little better and I wish there were more things to enjoy or to 
6872,5,Absolutely stunning view Theres a cafe right on the top which serves ice cream thats really tasty I highly recommend you take the Seoul sky tour when you visit Seoul You wont regret it
6873,5,Tallest
6874,5,The view from above is superb You must try the sky restaurant
6875,5,Amazing
6876,3, Parking is not recommended It was not a good experience as there was no discount for parking at the museum 
6877,5,Great excellent wonderfull
6878,5,A must go for all in Seoul
6879,2, Is it worth paying 30000 won to take the elevator The glass looking down is almost opaque making it difficult to see underneath 
6880,4,This observatory is situated on the 117123 floor of Lotte world tower the tallest building in South Korea
6881,5,One of the tallest building in the world I really enjoyed my visit to Soul
6882,5,seoul from birds eye view
6883,4,Great experience to see the Seoul skyline
6884,1,It was our fault that we visited on a school holiday World School Festival or something like that The entire park was overrun by middle and high school students all still in their school uniforms when we arrived after lunch The lines 
6885,5, There were many horses and horses during construction but now Seoul is like the Eiffel Tower in Paris 
6886,5,Amazing
6887,5, Its a wonderful trip with the family The night view of Seoul is really nice 
6888,5, restaurant visit The parking fee is 300 won for 10 minutes Do supermarkets and restaurants do not support parking fees 
6889,5, I made a reservation in advance and there was no wait The hamburger cake is very juicy and the truffle flavor of the french fries is very good 
6890,4, Use of Tower Bridge over the age of 12 a Son is disappointed 
6891,4, It was my first visit but it is very difficult to find the elevator 
6892,5, A place to visit at least twice during the day and at night 
6893,4, I have lunch plans with a friend Ive been to I searched for a good place in advance and went haha 5th and 6th floors Seoul Seoul 3080 I came here to have lunch and a cup of tea 
6894,5, Lotte is the best World Tower Signiel Avenuel Lotte Department Store Lotte Cinema Lotte Mart Lotte World Chairman Shin Kyukho and less Nongshim Lotte is currently one of the best companies in Korea and I respect the 
6895,5, Amazing view Beautiful panorama Several floors and each of them with different attractions 
6896,5, Looking down from a high place forgotten memories are revived and new dreams are created If you come here yes 
6897,5, It was nice to go around sunset time It was a weekday so there were not many people 
6898,5,very impressive location with a stunning view
6899,4, I stopped by the World Tower pharmacy ate coffee watched a movie and had a meal Its great but there are many places where parking discounts dont apply 
6900,4, Its great for outings with children but its already getting hot outside 
6901,5, It was confusing because there were several entrances but there was a guide so it was not difficult to find 
6902,5,Nice view Can recommend
6903,4, Rainy evenings are cheaper Its so high it doesnt feel real Its just terrifying hehe 
6904,5, We were there in the evening and therefore didnt have to wait and got discounted tickets A visit at night has a completely different vibe Seeing the city at night is breathtaking 
6905,4, People go crazy no place to sit in cafes I was just watching 
6906,5, Okay its much better than the Thailand Observatory but when it comes to eating Thailand has a better value for money 
6907,5, Isnt there a playground like this in town A good place to go anytime and with anyone 
6908,4, 34th 33rd 32nd floor Interior work is here 
6909,4, Compared to Seoul Tower there are a lot of things to see haha Viewpoint acknowledged 
6910,5, I went to the dutyfree shop so it was really good for shopping because there were no people there before 
6911,5,Cool
6912,4, It was a new experience but when it was released from the parking lot it was crowded with the cars shipped from the department store so it was inconvenient to be crowded 
6913,5,Commercial and business center
6914,5,good
6915,2, I dont live in Seoul so Im not impressed because its the afternoon It sounds like youre trying to make a story with a flying whale or a oneminute video but its a waste of money The building itself is not 
6916,5, I loved the beauty and organization of every detail I will definitely go back there 
6917,5,Although I am scared to the highs this wasnt as scary as I thought I enjoy the view and the small interaction between the staff and the visitors just make sure yo go when the weather is good otherwise will not be as worthwhile as you think it may be
6918,5,Beautiful view from the observation deck before we went to the elevator that took us to the 117th floor we saw a small exhibition A place worth a visit
6919,5,Sky Bridge was a great experience
6920,3, Lets go just once Ive been there so I wont go 
6921,4, I went to see the scenery at sunset with my family However I missed the sunset because I was waiting for the observatory elevator to see the planned exhibits but the night view is nice Its a good memory on a 
6922,4, There are various things to see and eat in the shopping mall 
6923,5,Awesome
6924,5, LA Brother Ribs LA Housewife LA Jung Sunghee 
6925,5, On the next day if you focus on the view check the weather a bit The ticket can be used to take photos and choose photos to buy or not to buy There is also a dress to go up the bridge above But with small 
6926,5, Perfect look like Lotte There are fewer people if you go in the morning First review 
6927,4, Good view but a bit pricey and there are similar good views from other vantage points 
6928,4, Its good Its good The path of movement The garden hits the ground 
6929,3, A good place to finish your Jamsil trip  While looking at Jamsil a billboard called  Todays Best View  stands in 
6930,4,Nice view Shopping and dinings
6931,5, You can see an aerial photographic view and witness planes passing in front of your eyes The road looking down through the transparent glass is rather high so it is 
6932,4,Amazing view Very easy to access by using the metro The mall is a place u definitely want to check out
6933,3, Lotte Tower is tall It was interesting and fun 
6934,5, Its delicious every time I go to Iseongdang Bakery Its a bakery that started in Gunsan 
6935,5,Very impressive tour the visit is very fun and the value for money is interesting Unobstructed view of Seoul which allows you to understand the extent of this city I recommend
6936,4, Its very accessible and there are so many things to eat and see around 
6937,5,Awesome
6938,4, Expensive but all in one place all you can shop place 
6939,4, The view is good  But I dont know what else is better 
6940,5, It is 555 meters high and we went up to the 123rd floor Higher than Magao Tower 
6941,5, Lotte World Ice Rink It was a Sunday morning and it was quiet 
6942,5,The view is super amazing and the tower observatory experience is lovely Id recommend you go on a clear day and during the night to see all the lights The 123 lounge can be skipped The milk bar should not be skipped 
6943,5, You can go up to the 123rd floor and look around Seoul and there are many different stores so it is good for shopping 
6944,5,Definetly worth visiting while in Seoul
6945,5, Worth a visit once The section where the bottom is transparent is quite dizzying I was worried that I had to wait for an hour to get on the elevator but I was 
6946,3, I had a great time with my family There is a lot to see a lot of people and the waiting time is long in a long line 
6947,1, I went to Suwon with my two sons for the first time My previous experience abroad I was thinking about it and 
6948,5, Very beautiful park beautiful architecture pleasant neighborhood I really liked it Its amusement park is also well maintained 
6949,5, Be sure to visit at least once If you are going go at night The view from the observation deck is no joke 
6950,4, There doesnt seem to be much to shop for Its great to go to the department store next door and take a walk around Seokchon Lake 
6951,4, There are a lot of people so it is recommended to go during the opening time 
6952,4,The weather was not great but the view over seoul was great
6953,3, Finding the way is complicated and you have to pay for parking no matter how much you use it 
6954,5,Amazing place
6955,5,One of the tallest towers in the World This place is a must see when visiting the beautiful city of Seoul There are many things to do within the tower such as an aquarium mall and plenty of restaurants
6956,4, It is recommended to go at sunset and see the night view of Seoul Well when you first enter you will be asked if you want to take a family 
6957,5, Unlike the neat exterior the closer you look the more overwhelming the skyscraper with the missing lines 
6958,5, It was the second highrise tower I visited after the CN Tower in Canada I went with my parents in the countryside on Mothers Day and it was better than I thought I think it was better because there is less fine 
6959,5,Lotteria massisutyo
6960,5,Did a walkin Wasnt sure where to go to start the ticketing as there was a small crowd But once we figured it out the process was great The pricing was reasonable 
6961,5, Its pretty good but it feels like a department store The observation deck is recommended when there are no clouds 
6962,5, Its a place I reserved for dinner on Mothers Day but I go there sometimes but every time I go there are a lot of people so its best to make a reservation 
6963,5,See the Seoul from the sky touching high tower
6964,5, Im going to the 31st floor Weekdays from 6pm to the night view just good 
6965,5,The 6th tallest building in the world and South Koreas tallest building The Lotte World Tower I want to visit Seoul in South Korea
6966,5,This place is huge We visited because we needed something to do during a rainy day So we went to the aquarium and walked around the mall Lots of great places to eat that are very affordable  We did not go to the tower since it was rainy and the view was not great On a sunny day though Im sure it would be a great place to see
6967,1,Dont bother going  The view Spectacular  The elevator ride Quite fun  The rest AWFUL  Its 90 degrees and they cant even bother to turn on the AC properly At more than 20 27000 won per ticket youd think theyd at least provide that basic level of a service Even though we went in the evening it was so crowded without proper ventilation I felt dizzy  The local 711 has better AC than this  If youre traveling with children or the elderly seriously reconsider Go to N Tower instead This place is way overrated
6968,5,Magnificent views across Seoul Currently still being influenced by Covid there were no waiting times at all Elevators bring you in lightning speed to the 119th floor From there a video show starts and ends after 1 minute with a breathtaking view over Seoul Afterwards you can stroll around freely on all 5 levels above including a small cafe with reasonably priced coffee and other drinks Even a small shop with gifts  souvenirs is available if you are into those kind of things
6969,5,seoul Lote Tower its amazing Tower its smart tower theres meny restaurants and caffe shops really its amazing place for visit i hope everyone will visit that place
6970,5,Favorite part of the experience was to go up to the 122nd floor and look around and also to have a cup of normally priced coffee The view is beyond spectacular
6971,5,Huge mall like you normally expect in Asia and the Middle East with loads going on Very clean and well kept So tall Go to Seoul Sky observation deck located in here Views are stunning The mall has mainly designer clothing on the upper levels These floors were quite quiet Lower down is busier with more affordable shops and various eateries Wifi is painfully slow There is a cinema and other forms of entertainment Walk to the really cute eating area there are loads I managed to find this one on the entrance level coming out of the Subway at the back Air conditioning is thankfully not too cold If you want a break in between sightseeing and to get out of the heat then this is worth a stop
6972,5,We went here last Saturday There are lots of people because its Saturday Everything goes well The view is spectacular  Highly recommended
6973,4,You can spend a lot of time at this location shopping eating and taking in the view from the top of the tower
6974,2,The Mall itself is huge and impressive therefore id give 4 stars Together with the tower actually only 2 stars Even you buy the ticket in advance there are long waiting cues over 15 hours Then on top there are just some small cafes nothing special and souvenir shops The view is nice but really not outstanding Only good thing there is the short elevator drive and enjoying a cocktail on top
6975,4,Its the highest building in Korea and has a very big shopping mall Near to it there is a park with a lake in it you can visit both and its not bad
6976,3,You can get everything It is of course very crowded Interesting Some stores are really nice and cute The metro station is at the basement The building is actually gorgeous from outside It is one of the tallest buildings in the world and the tallest in Korea The Signiel hotel is in the top floors We stayed at the hotel The hotel is phenomenal
6977,3,I wasnt overly impressed with this building I went to a function there There was nothing special about anything here The view is nice I wouldnt avoid it but dont go out of your way to visit
6978,4,the highest tower in Korea you can see Seoul from the top it really deserve a visit  however consider the queue on the elevator to the top floor I suggest that you just go after opening time in the early morning so you can avoid the waiting time  I really liked the gift shop on the top floor
6979,3,The mall is connected to the metro station so its quite convenient to reach We went on the new year eve for the countdown fireworks but it was smaller scale and not as amazing as compared to the one in 2019 Seems to have a great mix of shopping and food options would consider to come back explore again
6980,5,This 7 story shopping mall has great restaurants and activities including a large movie theater with a 4D screen
6981,4,I went into this shopping mall and its nice and expensive there are some nice restaurants below I went to the very top and the views are very nice although for me somehow it was a little confusing to get done and the staff kept pointing me in the wrong level so I am writing this and not from the top of the tower so obviously made it done
6982,3,We visited the Lotte Tower as it was not far from The Westin where we were staying There was a constant stream of people going in and out so we were intrigued The entire place is full of designer shops as well as the surrounding area We compared prices and they were similar to what you would pay in Australia Overall it was a bit of a letdown but interesting to see Not a great selection for Men
6983,3,for not being the tallest in the world  still having infrastructural issues during its construction; not even guaranteeing the view that would compensate for most of the price id say this thing is overrated; even when you get to the top some of the things are extra  buyerbeware
6984,3,The night view was average There were probably too many people  It was like queuing for an amusement ride Went through two rooms before getting on the elevator Bring a paper fan with you  There were two small balconies for viewing outdoor The logistics needs improvement  people going in and put were mixed together in a small glass room
6985,5,What an amazing experience and we had so much fun The food the stalls and the view all perfect You will find almost anything and everything there
6986,4,I enjoyed this park even though I went on a day when a tropical storm was passing through The entertainment was good the food reasonable Some rides had some really long lines like The French Revolution 3 hours cue Some rides I could not ride because of the restraints being to small for my large frame but most I could ride
6987,3,I enjoyed the view of Seoul but given the sometimes foggysmoggy local air you need to pick a good day to visit  I was struck by how similar the observation decks of really tall buildings are If you have been to the Empire State Building or Sears tower then your experience will be very similar here but it will be a different view
6988,3,Incredible views no doubt However zero information about the building A 2 hour wait in a boiling non air conditioned room will suck the excitement out of the activity Nothing to do upstairs and the terrace is totally closed off so its not any more interesting than looking from the window
6989,2,Very disappointing More like a childrens amusement park than a serious attraction No interesting information about the buildings construction or engineering just toys sweet shops and cartoon photos for the kids who were far too young to appreciate the wonders of such a magnificent building The management should go to Taipei 101 or Petronas Towers to see how it should be done
6990,5,The Lotte World Tower is an astounding architectural achievement Standing on a glass floor at 119 stories above the ground is scary as heck It was incredible looking down on 30 story buildings that looked like toys We were there on a clear day and the views stretched off forever The elevator ride from ground to 119 in just under 60 seconds was pretty incredible The tickets are not cheap but worth the price in my opinion
6991,3,Took the worlds first 60secs to level 118 The feeling was well nothing much Just abit if ears stuck The technology in the lift is also awesome Super high up the tower could see the overall of Seoul Its beautiful
6992,5,This mall is worth visiting The stores and restaurants are great Go up the escalator to the theatre and go out to the deck outside You look over the city and there are fun things up there
6993,4,The Mall is typical with boutique and restaurants with reasonable prices  Had visited the Lotte World Adventure with our DISCOVER Seoul Pass Rode the Bungee which was so nerve wrecking TheirAcross the Dark is not as hitech and thrilling as Macaus Batman Dark Flight They should improve their VR  Kiddy ride were a lot
6994,4,We were very excited to visit Lotte World and Lotte Mall we got Lotte world tickets before they open to void the long lines and it worked we were able to go to different rides without waiting for long time definitely it is a great place to visit with kids Lotte Mall was the most beautiful place I ever visit
6995,5,Lotte Tower provides a great view of the city The flashing lights all around the city and bridge makes it a must see at night
6996,5,Excellent views of the old Seoul and the new Seoul Seeing the many bridges from the 123rd floor was great The glass floor looking down on the street below was mind blowing
6997,5,easy to arrive with local public transportation plan your visit eve if you olny want to see the view try to visit the play area and walk arround  worth the time
6998,5,I am puzzled by the review I just read I thought this was a great observation deck and they spoke English very well They answered all of my questions And most observation decks I have been to have very few elevators And some sort of wait It took all of 10 minutes to get to the top for us and it started out with a bang The digital wall reveal is amazing The outside deck was scary fun All of the electronic assists in letting you know what you are looking at was great tech  A bit on the pricier side but still cheaper than The Empire State Building or 30 Rock
6999,1,1 the mall is like any big mall in Korea nothing special I think  2 my review is about the tower positive  outstanding View from the 117th to 121th floor about 500m  for that 1 point  negative  expensive adult 26000 Won per person  it took more than 70 min to get upstairs all the procedures like security scan taking photos to sell them later just endless waiting in several rooms without a window the air condition was turned on in stand by modus there was just simply not enough refreshing cool air coming out of the aircon nobody of the staff cared you just were pushed through all the rooms like a herd of sheep There were no information about the waiting time If i had knew that then i would have paid the fast check in ticket which costs 50000 WonThis is outrageous expensive but in retrospect worth it Of course first of all you must afford this price Everyone who is able to do it should do it because when you stand in the queue for about 50 min and you see the fast tracker who paid more because they knew and they are passing through the middle line to the elevator then the damn legs are hurting even more and you are still not in the elevator Because they skip the queue the waiting people have to wait longer maybe your spot in the elevator was taken by one of the high payers  show room was closed  the outside terrace was closed  the service and the staff processes have to optimize a lot I think  started at the end of the queue at 1630 to see the Sunset We arrived round about 1745 in the 118th floor Then it was dark night The windows are reflecting the inside light so the pictures you make are always with codisplayed with people around you  downstairs same procedure another QUEUE the second one A little bit faster downstairs round about 45min but still too much time lost The sightviewing floors are big enough there was no hustle so the main problem was the ONE and ONLY elevator of obviously 2 which was opened for the mass of visitors  the 2 walk with bottom glas view are not that impressive because you know you are standing on glas all the floor glasses are full of scratches  in the queue NO SITTING  Conclusion Lack of process optimization Great view but just go there when you have enough time and air in your lungs or enough money in your pocket to buy you a fast lane ticket Go there early enough to see the city by daylight and take some pictures without reflecting of the night indoor lights Prepare it to the Eiffel Tower in Paris it isnt that irritating like in Lotte Tower or the Empire State Building in NY there are timeslots there and you can buy the tickets simply online in english My opinion  To the operators this stay 2019 in Seoul we decided to stay at Park Hyatt Hotel but we had also considered the Signiel Hotel The best view was the most important factor in this years hotel choice Next year i do travel to Korea once a year because of my family it wont be the Signiel again For sure
7000,5,Standing on a glass floor on one of the tallest buildings in the WORLD was a tad scary but so worth it Views of the city and surrounding hills were grand while the sun was setting
7001,5,I can rave on all I like about being 123 stories and 480 odd metres in the air but unless you go up you wont ever appreciate just how cool the vies of the nightlights and the view of the Han River are
7002,5,If you visit with your Discover Seoul Pass you will get a small discount going up the tower but price is not unusual for any other attraction such as this in other parts of the world We paid EUR 19 per person and it was far more entertaining with the laser light show and the LCD display screens Once you get up to the top via the elevator you can go higher up using the escalators as there are 3 more viewing floors Coffee shop and sweet shop available Sadly the air quality was not good when we went so visibility was not optimal very hazy The mall itself was fun with lots to see and play with Fancy shops and I did not feel bored
7003,5,I went there at night  seeing Seoul late at night was a nice experience The glass floor in the two spots give you some thrills but its a nice sensation Definitely go
7004,4,Accessed from inside the train station this is a really great Tower experience Out of the 4 we experienced in South Korea this was easily the best A couple of staged photo shots then up in the super fast elevator Once at the viewing level you soon realise there are escalators taking you higher and to various shops and cafes etc Glass floor part is cool and all in all it was really good
7005,5,You need at least one day to leisurely walk around each of the buildings and look at the shops and the amusement park Gangnam is an impressive area WOW
7006,4,The entrance ticket was a bit expensive but overall the experience of the visit was really pleasant We went during the nighttime which was nice to see the overview of Seoul with the street lights but I think for a better experience it would be best to go during the daytime
7007,5,Probably one of the best 360 degree view of a city you can find anywhere in the globe Incredible scenes You are on the top of the 6th tallest building on Earth as well as the worlds fastest double decker lift to get that high Incredibly can also see the vastness of Seoul and planes landing nearby well worth it Can also access open air sections to view from and a glass floor section You just love to see it
7008,5,One of the best tours Ive been on The views are spectacular from every angle Our tour guide allotted 2 hours for pictures plus he planned the trip at sunset Amazing place a must see
7009,5,One of the best tallest buildings I have visited Very very modern opened in 2017 beautiful architecture very high observation deck 478m including a nice glass floor section great views to all Seoul
7010,5,Nice large complex containing a hotel mall and amusement park There are many things to see and do and you can spend a whole day going inside it without going out
7011,5,This is a very beautiful building from the outside You can then take the ride up to the top for about 25 each Give yourself at least an hour and preferably two hours It was not very busy when we visited but there are multiple queues that take at least 30  40 minutes to get to the elevators even on a slow period You can book ahead online to insure faster entrance The views are awesome and there is a glass floor This is a must do
7012,5,The Lotte Tower is an amazing place to visit and must be on your list of things to do in Seoul Its a little pricey for admission but well worth it A quick trip up an elevator with a 3D show to the observation deck at 500m reveals great views of Seoul Best on a clear day  There are several areas with glass floors with a view straight down the side of the tower Not for the fainthearted with heights Be prepared for the usual push and shove of people getting pictures of themselves standing on the viewing platform
7013,5,The Lotte World Tower is home to the Super Plex G the worlds largest movie theater screen according to Guinness Book of World Records A friend and I saw Infinity War in it and it was worth Just make sure to arrive early for good seating among the nearly 700 seats
7014,5,You will see amazing views from the tower the elevator is very quick and theirs a museum that you can walk around before you head up to the top Wow is all I can say
7015,4,Never se so many people trying to by so meny things in the last floorrs of this big building you need your pasport and by the way is cheaper in the states
7016,4,Despite the price tag the views from the tower are impressive and its worth going up Especially on a clear day you can see a lot
7017,5,I usually find towers touristy and a bit tedious but this was really something The height is incredible we were actually higher than planes flying in There are small cafes inside the tower and a shop to send a postcard that gets posted one year later  Recommend eating at the Lotte mall first as you get a decent discount with receipts from purchases on the day of the visit
7018,5,Visiting this building is a mindblowing experience Its 500 metres tall in the other side of the city Its really tall Once you enter the lift elevator it takes just 2030 sec to reach the top Then the view is simply breathtaking Its difficult to capture the whole of Seoul in the camera but one will leave with the memory that is hard to forget Enthralling view must visit The entrance fee is slightly pricey but worth it
7019,5,We bought our tickets on the app Klook and it was about 50 a person for the amazing combo deal for Lotte World Lotte Tower and Lotte Aquarium We noticed that for Lotte World and Lotte Tower alone the tickets for those single attractions were close to 45 We filled an entire day with these Lotte attractions and had so much fun The Lotte World Tower was a highlight of our trip We ate at the 123 Lounge on the 123rd floor it was a little pricey but what you would expect for a high end barrestaurant with a view like that Lotte World was almost like a smaller disney with the restaurants rides indoor ice rink and gift shops I can imagine this would be a great place for kids but even as two adults we had a blast We went on a Saturday so it was very crowded I would suggest going on a school day because we saw one of the lines for a ride reached a 2 hour wait with a line that wrapped around the Magic Island zone Other than that it was a pretty great experience
7020,5,Amazing place very fast lifts half a KM in the sky what views The restaurant was amazing too Definitely the best site to see in Seoul
7021,4,We were very surprised with our visit to Lotte Tower It felt like a Disney Ride rather than an observation point It was very well done with the modern technology available We actually elevated faster than falling to thee earth without feeling anything but your ears popping Also who can resist having a cocktail at the highest bar in the world
7022,4,Shopping heavens Just about anything you want Best of all instant refund with your purchase All you need is your passport There are also many restaurants cater to your taste We spent at least couple of hours here Fantastic
7023,5,If you are into shopping it is a place where you must not miss  take your passport with you to get the tax refund instantly or some of the shop will have your goods ready for collection at the airport on your departure date This is all on the 11th floor The Duty Free floor Very convenience and you have many options Next to it you just walk across to the Lotte Department Store another amazing place
7024,4,We love malls with easy transport access range of shops which suit different pockets large variety of restaurantscafes for refuel and supermarket Lotte World Mall hits all the right buttons We spent half a day here and the supermarket was very wellstocked There is also a floor of specially curated local restaurants which are famous in their regions for specific food It was a great day for our group
7025,5,Its a nice shopping mall I didnt go up the tower because in my opinion it was too expensive I think it was like 27
7026,5,Just for the experience of stepping on a glass floor 120 floors above ground wow The views all around are amazing
7027,3,Very large modern mall that is compromised by the towers above it Has all the big brands but has a bit of an odd layout
7028,5,Great place for those who love shopping Lots of shops and lovely cafes Prices are different a lot of sales Losing track of time
7029,4,I was in Seoul for business and we were invited by Lotte to tour the tower complex We went through a compelling video on the building of the tower and models of the site Then we took an exciting elevator ride to Level 117 and viewed the gronud from the glass bottomed viewing platform Finally we went through all the floors ending on the restaurant on Level 123 There are cafes and other amenities for families and the view is spectacular and well worth a visit
7030,5,The mall was really large and they offered things in a good price The tower had a great view and I personally think it was better than the Petronas or Taipei
7031,4,A fantastic complex if you like high end shops The cost of going up the tower was in our opinion over priced
7032,5,Excellent place to visit if you want to spend the day shopping and sightseeing Dont miss the Library inside perfect for Instagram pics We didnt go up to the Tower but heard the view is amazing
7033,4,This is one of the biggest malls Ive been into Maybe even a 2 day or all day event There is an aquarium stores divided by malefemalechildren  A food court area there are designated seating areas depending on where you purchased food from But definitely not enough seats We stood with our two small children staring until someone got up  There is a huge tech store Similar to a Best Buy  We initially went here to see the Studio Ghibli store Which was pretty small but still super cute And we will return to buy some more Ghibli souvenirs  This malls also has an individual Vans store Which is nice Because you can usually only buy those shoes at ABC mart here
7034,5,Great view around the lake nearby lotte tower The nearest toilets can be found on nearby restaurants Best view at the park on left side of lotte world facing lotte world from this picture Use naver to navigate when commuting There are mopeds scooters and bikes thru applications too if you want to go biking it is located near bus stations 500\  hr use You must install app first egmobike
7035,5,A very cool 555m tall skyscraper in Gangnam right next to Lotte World amusement park The admission ticket was about 22000 Won Not too bad as we a free photo for every 4 ticket purchased Its still a relatively new building The superfast lift is lined with LCD screens that light up as we go up Very cool and took less than a minute to the 118th floor Once there go to the glass floor area and look down What a great experience Go to the 120 Floor to check out the outdoor area You can see the whole of Seoul from up here A great experience for the family
7036,3,Very crowded You got to go thru a long line for any rides All day pass is pricey but cant ride enough due to long lines everywhere You might want to pay more to get an express ticket to avoid lining
7037,5,Room 88th floor was well appointed with the expected amenities and very quiet with a great view of the city Even the clouds couldnt dampen the mood The staff were very kind and always super polite There were no hiccups with the reservation parking or dining The aquarium was nice for kids and the nearby shopping had all the top brands and the latest KPop paraphernalia I had high expectations and they were met
7038,5,Huge Mall Shopping Food Entertainment Lotte World Adventure Many restroomstoilets There is Park outside with a small lake manmade where we stayed for an hour to relax Accessible by subway train
7039,3,Its a luxury mall Not the best mall Personally Singapore has better malls Its just super hyped You can skip it if you are a budget traveler
7040,4,Youre probably here for the tower its the 8th tallest in the world and offers some incredible views of what I consider to be a beautiful city We didnt spend much time in the mall only making our way to and from the tower but it seemed a shoppers paradise The tower itself is incredible Well designed and a good experience for patrons we had a seat at the bar over looking the 1988 Olympic site Drinks were expensive but we were on top of the city so we didnt mind Coming down from the tower we managed to get lost going to the duty free area It was somewhat difficult to get back to the regular mall as the lifts didnt indicate which building you were in
7041,5,We went to find a specific store Beanpole and we bought some outfits there Its very expensive Customer service is unbeatable So many people just waiting to help you can be a bit overwhelming sometimes but it was very nice
7042,4,The Lotte Tower is the 8th tallest building in the world at 486m and 125 stories For comparison the Burj Khalifa is 228 storiesalmost twice as tall The elevator to the top rises 118 floors in one minute The views are great I would shoot for offseason and I like the views best at night This is one of those places that easily gets jammed with tourists at the wrong time The observation deck has a glass floor and just a net over the top to catch things falling from above What can fall from above at this height It would also be tremendous to see a fireworks display from up here New Years Eve must be wild
7043,4,Being the 5th tallest building in the world this is well worth a visit At the top of the Tower there is a glass floor allowing you to see all the way down Bit pricey but worth it
7044,4,I intended to visit just the tower but there was so much to do I came back for a second day The Tower has great views and you can eat on one of the levels as well Just dont skip anything on a level as I couldnt figure out how to go back down just a level only all the way down to the 1st floor Little world amusement park was wonderful had the best roller coasters on the outside and plenty of smaller rides all around The Lotte Museum was great too spent half a day inside there and they let you take pictures and have other interactive items They have a KPOP experience as well it was nice just not to big they could make that much better Then the mall has tons of high end brands to everyday items You can easily spend 2 whole days here to see everything
7045,4,Next and connected to Siegniel and the Siegniel Hotel the highest building and the highest hotel in Seoul A huge shopping mall that also near to the theme park suitable for families with kids Very crowded on weekends
7046,5,Great shopping mall overall Lotte is one of the hallmark shopping mallssupermarkets in Korea They have some of the most interesting shops and supermarkets there I liked the video game shop a lot But they dont have all those video games that you might think in North America But the world tower is beautiful and bright Will return there one day Its pretty close to the Seoul Railway Station in which you will meet beggars around the underground
7047,5,I was in Lotte World Tower for a movie premier The place is conveniently located next to the train station so had no problem to reach It is huge and hosts many stores
7048,5,A stunning building really worth visiting it The 5th highest building in the world till now Keep in mind that great view will be experienced only during good visibility
7049,4,It was really beautiful inside Lots of duty free shops for cosmetics worth a visit and cheaper than the regular market went on top to the sky deck as well beautiful city views
7050,5,Lotte World mall has an awesome creative design how i wonder is the design per zone beautifulelegant perfect The upper class product is available here such as hermes burberry etc
7051,3,more than 100 stories tall building ideal for seoul night scenery hunting individual and families to catch a chill drink on top
7052,5,Go during the day there is less peoplewe waited in no line Went to the very topwhere there is a bar Go out onto balconygreat visitwent to mall for dinner
7053,5,We took our grandkids to Lotte World and couldnt believe how special this wasit is literally a miniDisneyland within the mall Terrific some scary rides and plenty of options for many age groups Everything is run efficiently and there are plenty of food options for all
7054,5,From my point of view this was one the most amazing views Ive ever seen in my life its an amazing experience descending more than 500mts into the fastest elevator over the earth
7055,5,On a clear day you can see everything because it is the only high building near and far Finished 2 years ago it is the ultimate land mark A modern elevator brings you up quickly then you have various viewing platforms also glass floor to look all the way down You better love hights
7056,5,This wonderful place to shop or spend your evening strolling around at the lake just outside the mall Blessed with good weather and cherry blossom last week To get here was easy with the subway
7057,5,At 27 per person it was a pretty costly trip atop the worlds 5th tallest structure but worth it for the night view Went up just before it turned dark so got a view of the city in the daylight but its the night time when the city really shines Photos are tricky during the day because the external water stains are awful and at night theres the light reflecting off the glass in some places but with 360 viewing youre bound to capture a few great shots Note there is an airport type security check before heading into the elevators I didnt have anything of note but not sure what youd do if you have something not allowed up Inside the elevator the ceiling and walls light up with an amazing show as if youre flying into space On the ride down there is a fireworks show on the ceiling and walls Unbelievably fast ride considering the trip up 120 floors Don t go if youre claustrophobic people are crammed in but very short trip  felt like 30 seconds  so not too bad
7058,5,try to enter lotte world tower and go up to 117th floor and up to 121st floor great amazing views all around seoul can see gangman area and olympic park from here
7059,5,To travel with the speed of light in an elevator to the 124th floor of the tower was an amazing experience World class
7060,5,Lotte tower The 5th tallest building in the world Amazing feeling when you get on top with scenic view of Seoul there is also a big shopping mall in the building with a lot of shops and food choices
7061,5,Amazing view and scenery from the top of the tower where you can enjoy spectacular view of seoulsimilarly you can enjoy the shopping in mall where you can buy alot of branded itemsand yes dont forget to take pictures
7062,3,This time my kids stuck me in a wheelchair dicky knees from arthritis It was a free wheelchair hire Everything was easily accessible It was incredibly busy though The average wait time for a ride was 180 mins It was a special day though if you dressed in a school uniform then you got in half price So uniforms everywhere Staff were great though and I went on a few rides Sometimes even managed to cut a line with my helper There were still steps to climb though which the staff were happy to help me with Beautiful at night due to the lights A nice way to spend an afternoon evening
7063,4,We visited the Lotte World Tower in February only visiting the Mall as a means of accessing the Tower  Quite a pricey visit although we were pleasantly surprised to receive a discount for using a Mastercard to pay for our tickets which then worked out at 48000 KrWon for two of us There are a number of corridors to walk through with images screened on the walls before you arrive at the elevator  a double decker and very fast You also have the opportunity to have a photo taken with a chosen image on a green screen behind you a similar opportunity is in place at the top of the tower but there is no pressure to take part  It was all relatively quiet at this time of year but the length of corridors and screens indicate that they are there to keep visitors engaged during the busy season and that queues could get extremely long  The lift ride up to the 117th floor was rapid ears popping en route and more images being screened on the walls of the lift as we travelled  The public floors at the top of the tower are more compact than one would imagine well organised with plenty of seating around the central section We felt it was far less commercialised than Taipei 101 with plenty of staff available but a pretty much hands off approach  There is a glass floor section for the brave where you can look out or down over 100 floors Not for the fainthearted but a good photo opportunity There are also two observation decks which have a double door arrangement to maintain temperature within the tower A member of staff regulates entry and exit to these decks It was dark by the time we accessed these the buildings were all lit up and car lights blended in along the roads out of the city and it was spectacular  Views are wonderful I dont think Seoul is a particularly attractive city but this was a good way to see it and the height added something The skies had been clear blue when we entered the Mall but unfortunately by the time we emerged at the top everything was rather misty and cloudy hence our best photos came after the sun set Any visit is at the mercy of the weather and particularly in February you do take a calculated risk if you are hoping for good photos  There are a number of retail outlets at the top of the tower with as one would expect Tower themed souvenirs ranging from postcards to much more ambitious items Prices not as hyped up as one might imagine Bizarrely a pick n mix sweet counter and a cafe an ice cream counter and a bar lounge  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would recommend it
7064,2,Its huge  super cool Many VR games rides BUT for almost all the main rides and popular rides the waiting long is super long It takes about 15 hours to 2 hours waiting in the queue per ride I didnt get to do much only a couple I waited for a roller coaster for 2 hours and realized all other rides are like that too And i arrive at 930AM early still need to wait 
7065,5,The tower was a well organized interesting place to visit We got some discount as 2 of us had birthdays the week of our visitGoing up in the lift was quite an experience because it was so fast it made your ears pop We went up as the sun set so had daylight views as well as night time Standing on the glass floor was quite an experience That was just in one area though so you didnt have to do it We couldnt go outside as it was too windy that day The mall is just like any modern mall anywhere in the world for me I didnt shop so cant offer an opinion about value for money
7066,5,I had already been up the Namsan Seoul Tower when I went here so thought it would be about the same But in my opinion the view from the lotte world tower is even better And the fact that you can stand on the glass floor on the 118th floor and look down just adds to the experience There was also a terrance at another floor which was unfortunatly closed when we were there  The mall is great with lots of stores But there are alot of malls like that The tower is what is truly special
7067,5,This mall is near to Lotte Hotel  this mall is bit expensive and if you look around properly you can find cheaper items as well  having many branded shops  good place for the shopaholics
7068,5,It was great to see and take photos of the actual view of the cross road beneath our feet on the glass floor at the Lotte World Tower  TIP Use the token given and take as many photos at every photo station You can choose to pay only for the best shots or none if all shots turn out bad as souvenir
7069,4,I had fun here with my friends We went to most of the rides and saw the famous MerryGoRound that was filmed in the drama Stairway to Heaven kdrama It is a nice place to come and have fun with your family and friends for sure
7070,5,This rather large collection of figurines showing scenes of the ancient life in Korea is very beautiful and worth spending one hour
7071,5,You can spend hours here there are tourist attractions restaurants supermarkets mall stores underground shopping and dining an adventure park tall sightseeing tower and connections to two major subway lines and scores of bus lines Just go here
7072,5,The tower was like hundreds of floors The view was breathtaking You can freely take photos even on the see through glass panel on the floor Though its so high the queue for the lift was amazingly fast Theres a shop selling candies souvenirs and even a cafe Can say that its kinda hot and stuffy inside Maybe bcoz were all wearing our down jackets hahaha
7073,5,Very impressive skyscraper which is among the tallest in the world Beautiful surroundings and attached is a very nice shopping mall Everything is very clean and well organized
7074,3,the game here is more intended for children not teenagers or adults the shortcomings of this amusement park are areas that are not too wide and too large for the price paid
7075,2,My wife and I have travelling through Asia for last 3 months and I needed shaving supplies We stopped at Lotties for some supplies When the clerk helping understood I wanted travel size products she suddenly could not speak English I made my way down to the grocery store where the staff bent over backwards to help Perhaps boutique staff could learn a thing or 2 from them
7076,5,Awesome place with lotsa fund things to do and shop Good food at level 31  observation deck at level 118
7077,5,The Lotte World Tower and Mall is a must when in Seoul The Lotte World Tower is one of the tallest building in the world and offers a day and night breathtaking view with several floors open to the public to visit from the 117th to the 121st floor Also you can enjoy and relax by having a dessert and a coffee while you enjoy the view or seat and get an artist to draw you a caricature plus an area to buy some nice souvenirs You can take pictures to the inside and the outside and wait to see the beautiful sunset in one of the best cities in the world Seoul  Finally you can take a walk on the Mall and make sure to go outside and take walk in the park around the lake
7078,4,This is a must visit for anyone who would like to experience highrise building We took a lift to 117 floors and from there you can take pictures lying on the glass looking down For people who afraid of heights perhaps you can take pictures leaning on the glass windows instead A good place to visit
7079,2,We were there for 6 hours Not even a single attraction can be visited everywhere queue wait 2 hours at each ride pathetic Poor safety management No restriction on crowd allowing
7080,4,Mil Feuille and Creme Brulee is awesome  Macaron is terrific  Capuccino is also good  Located on the 1st floor at the Lotte World Mall  Easily accessible buy subway
7081,3,It was an average visit Due to long que for each ride We end up just got into a few The que was quite insane It was so cold and a lot of the outdoor rides were closed We were compensated with the Christmas parade at the end of the visit It was something nice to end with
7082,4,Visited when I did a trip around Korea there is many things to see in Korea and this was worth a visit
7083,5,Lotte World Tower is the tallest building in Korea and fifth tallest in the world The view from the top floor observatory is amazing where you can see the entire Seoul in a clear day There is a world class shopping center at the bottom where you can find all kinda of food in the world  this is a must visit when in Seoul Korea
7084,5,Great place to hang out with friends They have everything you can imagine Shopping theatre places for kids hotel office space residence you name it This is the tallest building in Korea and you can spot it anywhere you go in Seoul
7085,4,Having read some reviews and recommendations decided to come here for the sunset We booked the tickets for the time slot of 16301700 hours of entry There is no limit in terms of duration of stay at the top of the tower This gave us the opportunity to view the city before the sunset and during the sunset at about 1718 and then to take in the views of the city covered with lights when it is dark  There is a family discounted price for 2 adults and 2 children the tickets totalled 87000 won as compared to buying them individually at 27000 won for each adult  If you have visited the Lotte Aquarium the ticket stub will also provide you with some discount on individual tickets discount does not apply to the already discounted family package  There is also some discounts for senior citizen do ask the counter staff at ticketing booth before paying  This is well worth the visit as you get to see the city of Seoul for 360 degrees and this is the sixth tallest tower in the world with a height of 500 metres
7086,5,Everything youd expect from an upmarket shopping hotel and office complex here  lots of stores a cineplex dining and the Lotte Art Museum Very crowded on weekends of course
7087,5,beeing in Seoul you should try to catch a view from top Would recommend to go there for sunset This is something you would miss
7088,4,The mall is big and spacious You can find many branded store and restaurant here Theres a lotte mart inside the mall as well Where you can stock up your snack while visiting to Lotte World Theme Park
7089,5,We went up at sunset which was the perfect time as you have to book a slot which is available each half hour Once you are up you can stay as long as you want though so we went up before the sun set to see the city in the daylight and then we watched the sunset and saw the city lights There are multiple floors when you get up one with a glass floor and another with an outdoor area so there is lots to see and from different viewpoints It was extremely well organized and staff very professional and polite The view was incredible you can see for very far over the city and the river Just make sure to go on a clear day They have a sign in the ticket area about the days viewing conditions to pick a good time for seeing the best Would highly recommend
7090,5,Great place for shopping with lots of brand Coming during sale season for many great deals and products
7091,4,Its 121 floors about USD25 to enter but worth the view Seoul is often foggysmoggy so if you can choose a time to go would recommend but worth the trip
7092,5,Lotte World Tower with its Seoul Sky should be on the list when visiting the city  It gives you a nice view over the city and is reasonably priced compared to other similar viewing platforms in other cities around the world  It was also surprisingly empty when we visited and the fact that it is stretched over 3 floors further gives you more space to roam around  They also have a small restaurant with a few selected dishes on the fourth floor
7093,5,You MUST checkout this giant Tower and see the observatory deck and the seoul city from the top there it ismAWESOME
7094,5,Dont you know that Lotte World Tower is the fifth highest tower in the world We went till 122nd floor Such an amazing opportunity for me I saw how beautiful Seoul City from the sky Fyi this tower is the highest tower in Korea You have to pay 27000won to enjoy this facilities  Pertamanya itu kita naik lift dari lantai 1 ke lantai 117 dalam watu tempuh hanya 1 menit Sebagian orang didalam lift itu ada yg merasa telinganya sakit Tapi untungnya aku ga ngerasa apa apa hehe Boleh deh dicob
7095,5,As everyone is know one of the best places to visit in Seoul is Seoul Tower for those who like adventure  SM Town for the Kpop lovers n today I visited those places I really recommend for everybody bez its really beautiful n u can feel Korea Oh by the way Seoul Tower ticket price is 27000 won n SM Town 18000 seoulgyeonggitourseoultowersmtownfeelfreetovisitkoreatravelsouthkorea
7096,4,This shopping mall has a wonderful array of upmarket stores and boutiques The food court has a great array of outlets catering to many different tastes
7097,5,This mall is like 7  floors Its a shoppers dream I stayed at the Signeil so I just took the elevator down to the mall to shop and eat every day Its also connected to other duty free malls as well as the subway is conveniently located
7098,5,An awesome experience by all The whole area adjoining this huge megaplex is fantastic and classy Top floor was great and worth it
7099,4,Lotte world is a large mall  hundreds of shops and lots of restaurants we used it to get out of the heat for half a day
7100,5,I really love this place The building is amazing and not too crowded Price is reasonable especially because I got the family discount Anybody who visit Seoul should visit this place
7101,4,Very typical shopping mall with all international brands as well as many small stores Big surprise they even had a Swiss Music Box store Reuge felt like home
7102,4,I found myself inadvertently exploring this huge mall as I tried to find the cinema complex which was on various floors in the main building of the mall I was under a bit of time pressure so I didnt fully explore the full extent of the shops in the mall But there certainly seemed to be a plethora of high end branded shops and stores as well as more than enough places to eat and drink No doubt a compulsive shopper would have a field day here There was even a duty free shop but I didnt go in this time
7103,4,I think this mall can be a must to visit if you will stay in Seoul huge mall with a lot of shops and restaurants also dont miss to visit the tower the view and the experience to see Seoul from the top is something you would try
7104,2,Mall was a disappointment Especially Avenue and duty free Aquarium was average Not much to see inside
7105,5,Lotte is a conglomerate that basically does everything So why not a shopping mall Enormous shopping mall with from aquarium to restaurants If you have only one day to go shopping visit here They have a supermarket too
7106,5,I went up hot the 120th floor of the lotte world tower and is was amazing The view from the top was amazing You had a 360 degree view of the city Well worth the visit
7107,4,I love to visit sight seeing towers whenever I go to a new city It gives you a wonderful view of the city and this one was great Being able to see a lot of the Olympic facilities was really awesome
7108,4,Coming from the malls of Bangkok this mall feels about normal Nice and clean and busy We wandered for and hour and it was fine
7109,5,the stunning elevator ride to the top was superb We were lucky it was a clear day and needless to say the views were stunning The outdoor viewing was another plus  the glass floors were great Well worth the visit
7110,5,We went to the top  Great views and nice places to eat in the mall near the entrance We arrived by train to jamsil station very easy and had a walk around the lake after
7111,3,Spent a few hours there with the kids They thoroughly enjoy it except for kids under 4 years old I think this suit kids above 5 yrs old or older Nothing much for elderly or parents looking after toddlers I would think you can spent a whole day there A plus point is there are shopping and you can walk to the aquarium on the other end
7112,5,well the mall was excellent but the prize were crazy for me lol to enter lotte tower you need to enter inside mall believe me you would have great times at this lotte tower
7113,5,Look at Seoul in a very special way 120 floors above the ground give you a stunning view of the whole city But the price is a rather expensive and theres quite a bit of waiting time around 30 minutes or so on weekends and holidays
7114,4,The Lotte World Tower and Mall is worth a detour Not because of the mall very nice but also very much like any high end mall No; go up the tower Its not cheap but definately an experience They eg have a glass floor were you have a somewhat unnerving view straigth down But also a truly spectacular view over Seoul
7115,5,The Lotte World Tower  Mall is the perfect spot for tourists who are in Seoul for the first time With 28000 KRW per adult its a bit expensive but in my opinion its worth it You can easily get there by metro since theres a station right beneath it The view up there is amazing and youll get a hint about the massive size of the city Definetly a recommendation
7116,5,This is one of the tallest buildings in the world where you can have a panoramic view of Seoul and the famous Han River On 118F its time to show your courage The glass floor is there waiting for courageous men to step on it Looking down through the glass can make you shake and worried if the glass breaks at any second you are staying on it I was just so amazed how kids fear nothing  they lay on it and they even jumped up and down STOP PLEASE I screamed in my heart  Tip Check the sunset time and plan your trip It admits limited people in each time slot so reserve your ticket early Sunset view on the glass is the definite thing you want to try
7117,5,Upon entering this building your taught all about the building with some cool effects and oleds screens the size of the room Stunning Then you finally get into a double decker elevator that rockets you to the top fastest in the world The effects inside the elevator also cool Then your brought to the observatory floors and you start to act like a kid 360 views of the city and also below your feet Both sides have glass floors so there really isnt a line to wait to walk on glass Theres a cafe wifi and some cool museum pieces I got to to look at Napoleans hat and some hand written letters by him who would have thought while touring in Korea I would get some french history under my belt Great for all types of tourists And theres a theme park in this mega mall too and a hotel so i suggest booking a few days here
7118,5,The shopping mall is quiet expensive but food in the basement was affordable and good The tower provides a nice view over Seoul When we went there the sky was clear so you were able to see far
7119,5,This is so huge that its is impossible to completely traverse the whole place One can get almost anything here The lotte mart below is also very nice and reasonable price wiseon the top is the lotte tower which gives the entire city view from the 123rd floor Good places to eat as well
7120,3,One of the biggest shopping malls Ive even been too You will be able to find almost anything you need on your shopping list here The mall  tower  Amusement Park is all interconnected by the underground passage
7121,5,Go here for some good shopping and certainly has great AC as it was very hot there in August THe Signiel Hotel in the Tower is the best hotel in Korea
7122,5,To go to the top of the Lotte World Tower is an unique experience From the lift till the view is fear the price that cost
7123,5,I thought the view was better than N Seoul Tower You can not stand outside of N Seoul Tower It is surrounded by glass that glares so you can not take adequate pictures Its also very crowded These flaws are not shared at Lotte World Tower You also have more stuff to do there shopping eating or just walking around
7124,4,We went early and they have an early bird special so before noon it was a few thousand won cheaper Since the building is on the east side of the city if you go in the morning the sun will be behind you and youll have a nice view to the rest of the city of the west It turned out to be a really good view I would also assume sunset is the other best time to go  Most of the floors are the same and its your standard going up a tall building experience with a fancy elevator ride and an expensive gift shop up on the top Seoul isnt really gorgeous from this eastern part of the city and the view consists mostly of endless rows of apartment blocks Lotte World hills and the admittedly impressive Han River There is no Hong KongorNYCstyle standout skyline feature of Seoul to see from here because youre standing in it
7125,5,This place is really cool You have to try the food market I have never seen anything like it before I also bought cosmetics Everything you need at your finger tips
7126,4,Lotte World tower provides amazing views especially at night that are worth the visit alone and its very well connected to the Metro Little bit expensive but a great experience
7127,5,Located in the southern region of Seoul below the Han river Lotte World Tower is one of the citys mustsee attractions At almost a half a kilometre tall over 1600 feet on a sunny day it can cast a shadow in the sky and provides stunning 360 degree views of the vast metropolis Taking only around sixty seconds to reach the multilevel viewing deck you can step onto caged outside balconies stand on a glass floor looking down onto busy traffic take photos with ubiquitous kawaii mascots and marvel at the flawless overall undertaking and accompanying production LED screens computer graphics Unlike other skyhigh decks visited the attraction doesnt have addon charges for other experiences once youre up there  a welcome change to the usual tourist upsell Visited on a weekday the number of visitors was relatively low and allowed ample opportunities to take the perfect photo Entry is via the basement which is part of the larger Lotte World mall  The mall itself offers plenty of local and international fashion brands in addition to a vast variety of retail loads of food and beverage options and can be travelled to and from via the complexs underground railway station The mall is spread over two buildings one of which is the glamorous home to upscale couture boutiques While unvisited adjacent to the mall is the Lotte World theme park
7128,4,Bit out of Seoul city Good amuzement park for little ones Must visit place is the tower You can get a good view
7129,5,Up to 123 floors the view is awesome with many guid Lift is super fast plus video showing  We been to see Kaws holiday from tower which is a really great option     
7130,4,Lotte World Tower or Seoul Sky is much like other observation deck experiences As you buy your tickets you can check what the weather and visibility is like Prices were reasonable Got a 9000kw discount as it was my birthday month need to prove with passport There is security screens a bit of queuing and photos to be taken before you get to the elevator But having been to other Observation Towers this is not unusual The fancy super video screens were though The price of the photos was very good Up the top theres a few levels One allows you to go outside and another has the glass floor to test your brain I struggle to step out into the glass floor One level had a video to show what old Korea looked like compared to now which was interesting We checked out the top most observation deck where you had to purchase food or drink to attend but it was 27000kw for a chicken sandwich so we passed It was the first time we had seen really inflated prices so we were shocked But overall it was a good experience Only a must see if you like seeing the sprawling city Back on the ground floor in the mall was s really nice restaurant that had Italian food  pizza pasta and a lamb salad that was to die for But I know you dont go to Korea for Italian food but when youre with a bunch of expats they are hanging for a taste of what they miss from home and pizza and salad are hard to find
7131,4,One gets a wonderful view of the whole Seoul from the top of this tower; it is a worthwhile experience although very expensive After paying the entrance fee the visitors are taken through a long path before reaching the elevator to the top of the tower and have to waste their time while the staff takes compulsory photos of them; if one wants a copy of any photo one has to pay extra money
7132,5,Awesome vista point You can see for miles The elevators are incredibly fast and you reach the top in no time Your ears my pop because its so high Once up top you have an awesome view of everything They have a glass floor on the edges that you can see through allllll the way to the bottom  Super scary if youre scared of heights Cool place to visit
7133,5,I visited with my 25 year old and 16 year old son a couple days after visiting N Tower I think Lotte World Tower was a nicer maybe because it is newer visit I have recommended this to my friends who travel in Korea
7134,5,Idea is great and the whole entrance procedure like entering space shuttle You will experience the extreme feelings to enter the glass floor ; There is also the balcony which is great to visit View on Seoul is amazing It worth to be in Lotte Tower
7135,5,We wandered into this place quite accidentally After going to the Lotte mall my 11 year old son suggested we go to the top of the tower and see the whole city We went and asked the security man and were introduced to Seoul Sky A very interesting lift ride with distraction videos on its walls took us to 117th floor From here there are escalators to the higher floors On 118th floor there is a glass floor observatory where the brave can stand and the timid can take photos anyway Can be quite scary but I lay on my back instead of standing and took some selfies showing the streets below On every level you can take photos of Seoul For example the Han river and Olympic Park There is a place for photos which you buy or you can take your own There are also souvenir shops and I think there was a small cafe Then back to the lift and down to the mall It was an awesome experience despite some cloudiness
7136,5,You might be curious about visiting the Lotte World Tower and rightfully so Its the 5thtallest building in the world but many dont realize it has the thirdhighest observation deck on the planet This is a rare structure in which your head will surpass 500m above the ground something that wasnt even possible until the past decade  One level features a glass floor for those who are daring enough to walk out and two small outdoor decks with protective netting if you want to smell the air up there They offer plenty of souvenirs and even a tiny bit of food But dont bank on having dinner up there Much like the World Trade Center in New York youre treated to a visual montage on the elevator ride up so you can appreciate the evolution of the surrounding city  And while youre here you might as well go below ground to the insanely massive mall with endless stores and excellent dining options Eventually you find yourself at an aquarium and an ice rink I mean this tower and mall literally have everything you could ever imagine
7137,5,Its pretty cool being up the Lotte World Tower I believe I spent 27000Won and I caught the last trip up around 8pm they close around 10pm I believe The elevator going updown has some really cool videos of the Tower Very entertaining It also shows you what floor youre in and how many meters youre up above the ground OMG I love the views the gift shops and the restaurants up the Tower The restaurants are a little pricey though lol Go during the day or night you will definitely have plenty of picturesque view of the city underneath you Theres also a place where you can go outside and experience a nice breeze It was really nice Go and check it out for yourself Also parking is plenty around the Mall and the surrounding area if you are driving to get there
7138,5,For one thing it was so quick to get inside and to the top of the tower At the top views are 360 and you can stay as long as you like Couple of coffee shops but we came down to enjoy the Mall afterwards Both fantastic with the choice youd expect in Seoul
7139,5,great view of seoul and neighboring cities If you lack time and would like to see the whole seoul birds eye view this is the best spot it has also a very good options for food at the food court
7140,5,This absolutely surpassed my expectations The mall is just like all the other 10000 malls in Seoul The tower is just amazing It has a glass floor that hangs over the side of the building It is a very cool experience There are two sides where you can step out over the glass ledge and there is an outdoor observation area too That was pretty cool  The views are just amazing It is hard to even describe how amazing the views are Very impressive  There are several coffee shops candy stores and a gift shop Those are fine  If you dont do this I promise you are missing out
7141,5,Good place and very affordable entrances with ride all you can but you need to go there morning so that you can enjoy everything
7142,3,A Great once and done park Always crowded It is a great attraction that you want to check off your Seoul list but if you miss it you will live
7143,5,This was an experience The glass floor view is really exciting and made for some great picture taking The Elevator ride was fast but could not even feel it There is plenty of space to walk around and see the views of the city
7144,5,There is an expression Youll know it when you see it It could also be said Youll know it when you feel it From the second we entered the Lotte World Tower a sensation came over me as I looked up at the endless high ceiling Before I go any further let me state for you to truly experience this magnificent hotel you should have the option to experience the elements of surprise Therefore I will present only basic facts enough to peak your interest without giving away all the unique features you will experience If you were to google a map of Seoul the most obvious feature you will notice is a building towering above all other structures The Lotte World Tower is the tallest building in South Korea reaching 123 floors at a height of 1819 feet It is the fifth tallest building in the world Just for the record our room number was 9882 That is correct the 98th Floor The view was breathtaking and certainly the highest floor we have had the pleasure of staying for the night The hotel is connected to the Lotte World Mall The Mall is exceptionally large modern and beautiful offering a host of famous brand names with numerous places to eat with a variety of delicacies from around the world In the basement of the hotel is an outstanding Aquarium truly worth visiting Their specious lounge is a place we frequently visited to relax and enjoy the panoramic view of the city located on the 79th floor There is an outstanding observation deck located on the 123floor overlooking the city From our room we could see the river that was incredible especially when watching the city lights at night The hotel of course offers all the amenities found only in the top luxury hotels Wait until you see your uniquely designed room especially the bathroom I highly recommend you take advantage of their outstanding breakfast Everything is fresh and with a variety of choices that are professionally served My suggestion is order their smoothie the combinations of taste is exceptionally delicious Of all the highlights offered by any hotel it always comes down to the quality of service by the staff Having travelled around the world the personnel at the Signiel hotel we would rate above outstanding Their kindness and efficiency is second to none and they make you feel right at home We consider the whole complex a City within a city Seoul has hundreds of top end hotels to choose from but if you want to truly experience something from a fancy world the choice is obvious It certainly captured our hearts the moment the doors were open On a personal note when visiting a new hotel I always make a concretive effort to try and find flaws Paying particularly attention to the smallest details to challenge their efforts to put their best foot forward I can honestly say without hesitation; this hotel is truly a Perfect 10
7145,5,This is definitely a must see location You have to get down in the basement that is to go up up up From the amazing plasma displays the architectural history to the phenomenal views this place is worth the trip We spent about 2 hours peering out of Seoul Sky and then a few more in the mall In Seoul Sky there are a few cafes a gift shop and a restaurant The views are spectacular It is worth the 27000 won for adults Lotte Tower does not allow you to make online reservations with foreign credit cards So get there early  Cheers
7146,5,Absolutely my favourite place in Seoul Very nice area and the Mall beside is amazing I miss this place  View Sublime
7147,5,As a Lotte Hotel Guest I got a discount and quickly ascended to the top The Tower opened April 2017 and is very impressive
7148,5,The Lotto tower is a must to visit You feel as a little thump when you are near the tower The area around the tower will also surprise you so you will find the van Gogh bar you will see the wealth in the special shops People will arive bij car and chauffeur to do their shopping Oh yes you can also to the top of the tower to enjoy the view over the town
7149,5,supper mall if you are in Seoul this is something you need to do and go to the top the rest you will figure out
7150,5,Comparing to other towers the full experience is incredible Since you start walking thru the elevator you will be able to admire how the building was made and a comparison between old and new Seoul  Eventouhth its expensive you must visit it
7151,5,I went to lotte tower whilst visiting korea during the olympics an the view from the top is amazeing It was was a vit overcast when i went but on a clear day i can imagine it to be brilliant Theres plenty to do here aswell shopping eating food an theres even an aqaurium in there Defo worth a visit if your in Seoul
7152,4,We traveled over to this side of town strictly to go up the tower and see the city We went up in the afternoon and there was no wait at all The elevators were really cool View at the top was nice and the windows were clean a pet peeve of mine when taking pictures There is an area that you can stand over a glass floor which doesnt have any additional cost We walked around the mall afterward which had some cool stores and places to get a snack
7153,4,I have visited the place a few times and this time the tower is fully completed and in business It is a majestic landmark Seokchon Lake in front of it is very beautiful in early April with flourishing cherry blossoms The lake is romantic at night with lakeside lights The lake is sort of divided into two sections separated by a bridge but one could walk around the whole lake along the walkway It is somewhat confusion trying to get to the lake but I usually choose to either get out from Exit 2 of Jamsil metro station or from Exit 14 of Lotte World Tower
7154,5,The Lotte World Tower has a wonderful observation deck st the top of what is the 5th tallest building in the world Avoid weekends to avoid long lines Try to go on a weekday afternoon when the sky is clear Very fast elevator to the top and incredible views of Seoul
7155,4,Quite a distance from mid town and the entrance fee was 28 for an adult We saw the sunset and the night view very nice The final stop was the restaurant which we didnt know until we got up there You wont be able to see anything unless you order So we left I wish we didnt have to go up to that floor The floors below had marvelous view already
7156,5,This is amazing It is a place for allCentre for shopping and dining  Also best place for kids and there is full division of game zone Aquarium is worth going
7157,5,I love skyscrapers so this one was a must Very impressive when you first lay eyes on it Plenty of shops in the mall and plenty to do around it too Go to the Seoul Sky 117th floor I think or have a drink at the hotel 81st floor bar of Signiel hotel amazing
7158,5,Although it may be a bit hot in the elevator and on the top floor during February but in general I think its a pretty cool experience A must see as there is a bunch of shops on the ground floor and a nice park nearby plus world famous Lotte World If you have 56 days in Seoul its definitely a place to see
7159,2,We went here expecting to spend a few hours or so here but with the smoking and dirt every where we did not stay long Things were also not good quality or cheaper than at home in Australia
7160,4,This is one of the tallest towers in the world so we decided to pay the exorbitant entrance fee to see it for ourselves You can pay by cash or by credit After you pay your entrance fee you are taken to the lifts which take you to the observation platforms The lift in itself is a bit of an experience  there are screens on all the walls and the ceiling which display a short show about the tower while you are riding up  The towers are impressively tall and from that distance you lose perspective of how high up you actually are There are several observation deck levels and each deck has something different on offer There is a level that has a couple of glass floor areas where you can look down to the street below thats a bit freaky at first theres a level where you can go to a balcony area there is a cafe and when we were there there were displays commemorating the winter Olympics and some statues of the Olympic mascots that you could have photos with  We got there at sunset which was really nice We stayed for long enough to see the sun go down and the lights of the city come on We were there for about an hour all up
7161,3,If you want highend good this is the place Otherwise skip it as this mall is nothing special and is devoid of any character Limited dining options too Coex is a better choice
7162,5,Go there This is the best Mall ever I do not think we have one as nice in the United States There is food Designer Shops Shoes everything a person would want in the mall There is an Aquarium and an Art Museum I enjoyed it so much I went back a second time The train station has underground shopping also and you can access the mall from the train station
7163,5,5the tallest building in the world Just opened earlier this year If you are in the Jamsil area on a clear date make a trip to the top We paid about 26 for adults and 23 for 15 and younger It claims to have he fastest elevator in the world Its also a double decker elevator Views up top are truly spectacular
7164,4,Lotte Tower is the most iconic shopping mall in Korea It is pretty standard as far as malls go with a large variety of stores and restaurants but also it has some unique places and features If you want to shop I would recommend here It is a pretty standard mall but the sheer size is the most amazing part Also if you are interested you can also visit the top of the tower Being the tallest tower in the OECD means that it has some amazing views Not only that but Seoul is also one of the biggest metropolitan areas in the world sitting at around 25million people What does this mean An amazing view
7165,5,I went on a Monday so it wasnt that busy I paid the standard price no fast pass needed when I went You go through security screening The employees are very efficient and nice in directing you where to go The views are breathtaking and peaceful There is a small outside deck on the floor where you exit very cool experience I cant say enough
7166,5,The Lotte Tower Seoul Sky observatory should certainly be listed as one of the highlights of a visit to Seoul The views especially of the Han River at sunset and just after sunset are breathtaking You can also see the Olympic Park very well Admission at 27000 won is reasonable compared to other World Class towers There was no wait when we visited on at 6 pm Monday evening The surrounding area is also of interest for example Lotte World There was a haze but it wasnt too bad Seoul is a fascinating mix of its ancient civilization the devastation and its unflinching remembrance of its bitter first half of the 20th Century and the current relentless vitality affluence and modernity of today Along with the frenetic shopping districts the Lotte Tower is an iconic symbol of the latter Dont miss it 
7167,5,Great building very tall and the panoramic level is the highest in the word In september it wasnt very busy and the climbing process went pretty fast It is worth visiting I have been in panoramic buildings but this is the far most impressive
7168,4,The mall is located in a upscale area so with that comes upscale prices Modern designed and clean mall with many artistic displays Luxury designer brands line the first 2 to 3 floorsDining options are located on the basement level with some play areas and shops for kids This place is a shoppers paradise but if shopping is not really your thing it can been browsed quickly or even skipped without feeling like you missed much
7169,3,Normal if you visit at the day time Around the tower have shopping mall duty free and supermarket
7170,4,The fees for the Seoul Sky was quite expensive but at least the scenery is worth it Glass floor panel was interesting
7171,5,As one of the tallest buildings in the world this was a mustsee for me being a real estate enthusiast The views and experience are worth it Nice shopping dining and sightseeing experience all around Try visiting just before sunset so you can get both daylight and nighttime photos Once you ride the elevator up you can spend as long as you want on the top floors so you can relax take photos and just soak it all in
7172,5,You can only buy the replica of Seoul tower from the tower the best thing is to have coffee on the 123rd floor
7173,1,Like most places in fashion district the shopping in overrated Dont expect to find fashion cheap like in Taipei or Hong Kong the prices are close to what you will get in the USA or online order directly from Seoul If you are not tiny and thin you probably wont find clothes fit you
7174,5,We had a great afternoon here The views from the top are fantastic and superior to those from the Namsan Tower on the other side of Seoul The glass floors were fun albeit scary for the wife which added to the entertainment Well worth adding to your itinerary if visiting Seoul for more than a few days
7175,5,The tower was not open when we were there but it looks nice Lots of shopping with almost every store available Prices were higher than in the US so I would know your pricing before shopping
7176,4,This place is huge it includes shops the tower and an indoor theme park It was perfect for us on a rainy day
7177,5,Pricey but is gret to go once to see the skyline and to step on the clear glass and look down The mall has a good variety too If you have a mastercard you get a discount 10 At night is best because there is no wait
7178,3,We were accidentally visiting this mall on our way to Lotte World Lotte World Mall is a high end mall This mall has so many expensive brands Its a nice place to do window shopping Its location is in front of Lotte Department Store Jamsil Lotte World is inside this Lotte Dept Store  The unique thing in this mall is all the escalators operate after 1030
7179,3,Big shopping centre but with the added attraction of Lotte Tower and and acquarium Once youve seen one shopping centre youve seen them all
7180,5,Seoul Sky is located on the 117th  123rd floors of Lotte World Tower  Sky Terrace  and is the 5th tallest building in the world Great
7181,3,This mall was quite far from the Seoul city but you can reach here by using the subway train We went to this mall because we want to go to the Hard Rock Cafe
7182,5,I originally came to this to photograph the building but soon was taken in by the department store then the mall the the amusement parkand more I managed to find a wonderful group of locks on a fence to proclaim their love in the park next too the building
7183,3,Mostly high end shops so its a good place if you like window shopping or have ALOT of money We did find Krispy Kreme donuts
7184,5,Really enjoyed a visit to the top decks of this tower Went up at night and the view is definitely spectacular One floor has a corner with glass floor panels where one can look down and see the ground a couple hundred meters below A great place to take pictures  The mall has a luxurious feeling and there are plenty of shops from well known brands and restaurants to buy whatever one desires
7185,5,It was a really great trip to the top of Lotte Tower It was a bit overcast that day but the views were still spectacular There are several floors you can go to and there are glass floors you can look through I would have loved to go to the outside observation areas but it was apparently too cold so they were blocked off Overall it was well worth the price Barely any lines and it wasnt too crowded Would love to see the views on a clear sunny day
7186,5,This is a really tall tower that you can see in a clear day from Yeoido Have areally incredibl view of the city i will say the best view of the city If you go to Seoul this is a must go tower and mall Lotte did and incredible job with this tower at night have beutiful lights
7187,4,Great selection of high end brands Chanel and Van Cleef sales staff were wonderful Hermes not so much Maybe they couldnt speak English just stood there and stared at you hahahaso strange
7188,5,The elevator ride itself is worth the price of admission There are five floors for your viewing pleasure I think the third observation floor 120th floor has a clear floor that sticks out over the city street belowThere is a cafe professional photographers and a gift shop among other things It is real easy to burn through several hours up there even with an overcast day
7189,5,We visited the Lotte Tower on an overcast day but it was still enjoyable There is a lot to look at on the way up and plenty of space to view once you get to the observation areas There is even a glass floor section to enjoy There is a cafe or two a restaurant and gift shops If you are a military family they offer a military discount  The mall is divided into several sections One section has many restaurants with cuisines from around the worldThere are high and lowend stores novelty shops dessert shops The other section of the mall has many restaurants that are familiar to Americans On the Border Hard Rock Cafe PF Changs Califonia Pizza Krispy Cream There are several other restaurants that offer a variety of choices There is a beauty section plenty of sweets childrens clothing a caricature booth and an amazing movie theater It is huge They offer 4DX movies there and you can select your seat before going in They also have some interesting snacks to select from at the concession stands Military discount is available  Jamsil station connects the subway directly to the mall it is so convenient
7190,5,Enjoy it very much Too large to cover all areas It is advisable to buy the Magic Pass because eventhough we went there on weekdays but there were so many people and some attractions we had to queue for 1 hour
7191,3,Frankly i dont really think it is that wonderful Observatory deck  Been to a few other observatory decks in Japan and Dubai Lotte World observatory deck is on the average side The only memorable thing i remember is the glass panel on the floor Lotte World Mall  the first 4 levels are all the branded stuff and only B1 house more affordable brands Nothing much Although i must say they have tons of eatery places here so surely you can find something that suits your taste
7192,5,You could easily spend a full day in the mall itself The tower is amazing and definitely worth a visit Even if you have an hour or so free time Id recommend a visit just to see it
7193,5,123555I had to go to for a while business trip to South KoreaThis was my first time to go thereAnd I went to LOTTE WORLD TOWER SEOUL SKYThis Tower is a 123floor 5545metre1819 ft supertallskyscraper located in Seoul South Korea It opened to the public on April 3 2017 and is currently the tallest building in the OECD and is the 5th tallest building in the world
7194,5,right in Jamsil beautiful shopping mall with gold on everything Noticed that the reception ladies are all gorgeous
7195,5,I liked this new tower very much It is fifth tallest in the world There are several levels for viewing and with snack shops with a restaurant on the very top level It is over the Lotte mall which is fabulous Nice souvenir items inclduing photos Did not experience a long line in the winter No outdoor viewing permitted in January
7196,5,Lotte Tower is the tallest building in Seoul and the 5th tallest building in the world There is a 123 floor located songpagu district It is just near jamsil station You can reach using green line  line number 2 and use exit 1 or 2 The elevator is like a high speed trainit takes a couple of seconds to reach top of the tower You can take a good profil photos and also you can catch beautiful city view It gives you a 360 degree city view I went up the tower in the evening I was unlucky that the weather was so foggy So be sure that the weather is clear You can go daytime and also evening Two of these situations give you a different beauty of the city Han river Namsan Tower Gangnmam etc To go up the tower gives you a valuable opportunity to see all of city districts The cost wast a little bit expensive but it worth It was 27000 Won as you see in the photo that I uploaded  The appropriate time to spend there is approximately between 1 and 15 hour You can stay more because there is no limitation to stay there There is also cafe and restaurant that you can grab some snacks  Also you can have chance to take some incredible attraction photo when you are in the first floor They take your photo and when you go up the tower you can buy your photo or photos from reception which is located floor 120 or 121 You can print out it there or they give you a scan code and using scan code you can download your smart phone or tablet in that time The cost was around 10 000 Won as I remember I think you should try with your friends or family You will not regret  You can bring your baby children etc Dont worry it so safe 
7197,5,Visitors only can access to a few floors for free If you want to go to the top floor you need to buy an expensive ticket
7198,5,The tower is located near Jamsil station and you dont need to actually exit the station precinct to enter the tower It should take you around 40 minutes from the MyeongDong area  Once you buy the ticket and go through the turnstiles it will take you around twenty minutes to reach the top floor The entire process is orderly but takes time and that can be a bit boring  On the top floor the views are stunning Having visited Tky Sky Tree Sydney Tower Gold Coast Q1 Auckland Tower and Tstenkaku in Osaka this place offers good value The tickets are reasonable and the place looks brand new
7199,5,The Tower was finished 2016 and has a beautiful architecture inside and outside If you want to get an Impression of Seoul and the development of the city after the civil war go there With 555 m it is as far as height is concerned building number 5 in the world You can go up to 486 m with the elevator From this floor you have a perfect view of the Olympic area right below you the skyline and the river For us it was the number one sight in Seoul
7200,5,This tower is 122 stories high and has remarkable views of Seoul It is the tallest building in Seoul and the 5th tallest building in the world Part of the floor is made of clear Plexiglas so the brave can take pictures of them appearing to be hovering over the city Not this lady though I have a terrible fear of heights As long as I wasnt anywhere near the Plexiglas I was fine They have a souvenir shop and some restaurants in the tower It costs 27000 won to enter but you can stay as long as you like The ride up in the elevator takes only 40 seconds Im glad we took the time to visit here
7201,4,The mall houses the Lotte World theme park but our sole purpose of visit was to the Ghibli store and Lego store  After navigating the labyrinthine subway malls we arrived by metro we were told there were two sections of Lotte; Tower wing and Mall wing From our quick visit there were plenty of eateries and obviously shops The Lotte world theme park entrance at the basement was packed with students and kids  Great place with lots to see if craving for some retail therapy
7202,4,This is the tallest in Korea and 5th in the world It was a sunny day and the view was great  You have to pay 27000 won as entrance fee and its worth it They have a cafe and a souvenir shop at the 121st flr  Still worth a visit
7203,3,was staying in Lotte Hotel Seoul which offers free shuttle to its new and shiny sister hotel in Jamsil  The exterior is very impressive and we even went to the top of the tower with its most interesting elevator ride  However the entry fee to the top is pretty steep and the view is nothing to write home about  The mall itself is like any other shopping mall in Seoul
7204,3,I went there to go up in the tower I was very desapointed because it was close and no one could give me exact information about when it would open The Mall its incredible like so many in Seoul
7205,5,It is a great place to go with details since you enter Dont miss the short film at the beginning of your experience Sit down and enjoy all the monuments the film shows It also has a tree that shows the different seasons in Korea It is a very visual experience since the start Fully recommended
7206,4,One of the tallest buildings in the world Was interesting to look around the shopping centre and then go up the tower There is also a theme park and numerous restaurants Worth a visit
7207,5,We spent 3 hours plus at the observatory deck to appreciate the beautiful sunset view The elevator ride to the observatory deck was interesting similar to taking a chilling ride It took only less than a minute to reach the top level 115 The city view of Seoul was not fantastic but can view a nice sunset on a great sunny day
7208,4,It is complex malls Amusement park indoors and outdoors Department store observatory duty free shop cinema book store lots of restaurants etc If you stay nearby it is a must to visit
7209,5,Its expensive 25 to ride up to the top for city views but still worth seeing all of Seoul from its observation decks You can buy a photo of yourself taken as you enter with various backdrops
7210,5,We took the trip to the top of the tower on a reasonably clear day and could see for about 15 kms max but enough to experience the panorama that is Seoul The elevator in itself is a memorable experience and on a whole is well managed and arranged Definitely worth doing Book online in advance if its a busy time of the year and with the Seoul Visitors map there is a discount for the ticket pricer see ad on the map available from Tourist Info
7211,4,Quite expensive but up 500m you have like six different floors to explore You will have your view over Seoul from its best view Make sure its a clear day or night
7212,5,but the view is always depending on the weather We have been there and took the VIP Tour Really great guided tour with interesting information The ride with the at least they said fastest elevator in the world is quite short but impressive how fast you are on upper level From there you have to enjoy the amazing view We did with a beer 
7213,5,Its by far the highest building in Seoul and one of the highest in the world For a skyscrapers lover it really worth a visit There is a hotel on the top of the building so the best way to enjoy the view is while drinking your drink at the bar of the hotel
7214,4,the review is for only the tower we stayed at Lotte hotel and best part of it was we got tix from the hotel We didnt have to wait in line and went straight up bc we got the tix from the hotel That was GREAT  It takes a min to get to 110 floor You can go to the cafe or to the restaurant Otherwise its just looking at the view I enjoyed it and would say set aside 3045min Theres a line to get down but it went fast around late afternoon They dont let you take a stroller they keep it downstairs for you
7215,5,I didnt want to go to this place Our friends went so I went So glad I went What an experience Please go onto the plexiglass floorYoull get that special feeling between thrill and wanting to use the bathroom
7216,4,Basically similar with other high end malls in other cities The tower will give you the sight of Seoul City  As a muslim traveller the muslim praying room is one the best Ive been to in a non muslim country halal food is tricky as a lot of retail use pork and seafood restaurants are very expensive options Thankfully we found Poke Bowl in the food court near the theme park entrance
7217,5,Already the architechture of this tower is breathtaking Looking at the city of the deck on a hight of 500m is unforgettablepricing of KRW24000 is okay
7218,5,If the elevator ride wasnt impressive enough the views will thrill you even more Unfortunately the outdoor terrace portion wasnt open when I was there but the seethru floors were vertigo inducing on their own
7219,5,Seuol largest shopping centre full of every brand you ever heard of and endless restaurants Great travel links and a pleasant park and landscaping outside to relax
7220,3,Koreas tallest building had multiple safety issues before construction was completed including cracks in the floor of the movie theater and in the glass of tanks in the aquarium They took care of these issues and reopened these areas That being said theres nothing really special here Its a shopping mall with a movie theater and aquarium at the base of a tall building Dont drive here parking in the underground garage is outrageous
7221,5,Impressive observation deck with beautiful views from the tallest building in Seoul The elevator ride is fully immersive and very impressive with LED screens on all walls The observation deck offers views facing multiple directions and also features a glass floor for those looking for a little thrill There is a small cafe and a candy stand on the observation deck floors The building itself also houses multiple malls meeting a range of price points and a large food court as well as offices
7222,5,Fantastic views over the city and beyond Go at sunset and have a beer on the 123rd floor Wonderful
7223,5,The Lotte World Tower and the adjacent Mall are the latest touristic highlights of Seoul During my last visit I missed coming out here but this time I went there 3 times to see kit all You can take the Metro Lines 2  8 to get there
7224,4,Lotte world tower and mall is a huge mall  Conveniently located at Jamsil station line 2 and 8  exit 12  Main attraction is Seoul sky which is a must visit place  though a bit expensive I have written a separate review for the same  This mall is no different from Other high end malls of the city Multiple shops to buy from many of them offer instant tax refund on shopping above 30000 won Many places to eat as well
7225,5,We enjoyed the place it offers information regarding the tower and some historical information Nice show in the elevator At the top there are a great view great souvenirs shops coffee shop and restaurant And glass floor view for the braves The mall is huge with great shopping experience
7226,4,If youve been to Dubai it will somewhat remind you of Dubai Mall I dont think its as big but the feel of the mall is huge  fancy also connected to a metro stop as well as theres an aquarium
7227,5,We visited the tower on a weekday evening and there was no crowd at all I guess it was the absence of tourists that made the entire visit so pleasant The view at sunset seems to be one of the better time to visit too as the sun set the building and street lamps came on Simply spectacular
7228,4,Opening in 2017 the Lotte World Tower is one of the worlds tallest buildings I only made it to the 76th floor for a private dinner with another 50 floors or so to go to the summit but even from there the panoramic views of Seoul are impressive I would definitely come back to go to the top when I have more time 
7229,5,This is the 5th in the world and 4th in Asia Ive seen the others and this compares favourably The architecture us classical yet beautiful Connected to an amazing huge futuristic mall  Located at Jamsil area The observation deck from floors 117 upward costs about 50 but the queue is extreme  Plenty of food choices in the mall But be prepared to wait
7230,4,This shopping mall is new in connection of the Lotte skyscraper in Jamsil The most surprising finding was the DIY juice place on the second floor worthwhile to test
7231,5,I must say this has got to be one of the best towers that I have visited Its not the typical tower that you see when you visit a city which is usually one floor Here they have 3 floors with the 20thF being the best because of the glass bottom floor and the open balcony Aside from having a fantastic view of the city you can instantly post your pics as there wifi is really strong considering how high we were Really worth the visit
7232,5,I went with my family in weekdayfantastic because it was not crowded The price is \27000 about US 24 The best views in Seoul we choose a clear day Ideal to go in the afternoon to wait for the sunset and to take good photos You can go up to a floor and then you have several floors to see and even 2 outdoor terraces Its a cafeteria and a nice shop where we bought a magnet Then when you go down I recommend to eat at the Mall you have several options and for example On tge Border Pizza and Pasta or Hard Rock
7233,4,I visited the Lotte Tower in early September and had a great view of the city on a beautifully clear day The multiple observation decks and glass floors in certain areas make for an unforgettable experience I got there shortly after the tower opened for the morning 1000 AM on a weekday and was able to purchase my tickets and go right up to the observation deck without any waiting
7234,4,I went to the top in the beginning of the evening The view was clear and the city looks very impressive Also stood on the glass plate at the 123st floor There is also a sky loungerestaurant where you can enjoy the view with a drink or diner Romantic if you are with your partner but not alone
7235,5,The tower was interesting to visit We had coffee on the 123rd floor rather expensive but basically lying for the view The glass floor was cool Overall Id say the 5th tallest building in the world is definitely worth a visit
7236,4,It offers good view of Seoul when its good weather Fastest elevator in the world The pride of Seoul Definitely it was good experience
7237,5,I loved this mall We spent an entire day there There were two different sections One had more highend shops like Chanel while the other part had more affordable stores like Uniqlo There were also lots of great food options The only downside is that there are long lines for all of the restaurants We had to wait 45 minute to be seated for dinner
7238,4,I took the Sky Shuttle to the top of the tower It was not a very busy day for it but they still packed you into the elevator like sardines It would have been a much more enjoyable ride if they had 2 or 3 less people on the elevator You literally have people pressing up against you on every side Once we got to the observation deck I was disappointed to look out the glass and discover we were in the clouds you couldnt see anything It would have been nice if they had warned you before you bought your tickets that you wouldnt be able to see much There were a couple small breaks in the clouds and you could see a little bit of the ground but then all the rain running down the windows made good pictures nearly impossible When it was time to line back up for the elevator to go back down there seemed to be no order to the line people were cutting the line pushing  shoving It would be a great experience on a nice day if the staff did a better job of managing the crowd
7239,5,I went just to see the tallest building in Asia I was gasping with joy as i experienced several floors especially the see through glass floor They did a wonderful job of creating different experience by integrating tech media I didnt get to try yet but i heard their food somewhere in the middle of the tower is very good too I will definitely try the restaurant when i go back
7240,2,Super nice mall but seems all the doors are not wheelchair and stroller friendly We have baby stroller and needed two of us to enter and leave to hold doors Heard rumors from rich folks that this mall doesnt want handicap people to come Go check out starfield Mall at goyang they have wide auto doors and western style mall
7241,5,To be clear the mall itself is not crowded but the restaurants are overwhelmed with people I was there around 7pm for dinner Therere so many exciting restaurants but theyre all full Queues looked like theyre 40 minutes So I ended up with fried chicken and french fries which I wasnt impressed  Id still give 5 stars and recommend everyone for a visit but avoid peak hour if you want to dine here
7242,3,It is worth to go there From the tower there is a magnificent view of Seoul and its surroundings Unusual elevator to the top of the tower I would recommend to anyone no matter what age
7243,4,There are too many people in this area The mall is divided into luxury brand section and nonluxury brand section and basement restaurants are connected for hundreds of yards  This place has Lotte theme park subway station Lotte Hotel mall and business district all connected into one place It is a megs shopping district On the 6th floor there is a movie theater
7244,3,This is a very beautiful modern building There is a shopping complex under the tower close to Lotte World However the observation tower fees is just ridiculously expensive for the 5th tallest building in the world I would save the money to visit the Burj They have even a more expensive express ticket approx 50 USD which is crazy but I guess they have done their statistics on this It is however the tallest building in Korea and indeed you can see it from anywhere especially when coming into Seoul by land transportation
7245,5,My friends and I met at Lotte World Mall and spent our day walking around and dining The mall is huge right next to the tower and Lotte Department Store There are many escalators and I especially like the express escalators which skip stores 1000s of various stores you can find anything and everthing Lots of great restaurants and cafes We ate at Spsin Club and had a lovely dessert at Guylian Chocolate Cafe We didnt have time to visit the tower but will do so in September when we go bsck to the mall for out seafood dinner
7246,5,I have spent some time photographing this building from different sides It helps make a very good cityscape pics of Seoul Best pics are made if you get to the hills south east of Seoul I went with metro line number 5 to Macheon and then climbed the hills
7247,4,This mall houses a lot of things including Lotte World Adventure and the Seoul Sky the newest skyscraper in Seoul which offers 360deg view of Seoul and the vertigo inducing transparent floor Though more expensive than NSeoul Tower Seoul Sky is more superior and boasts of new interiors and less crowds The entrance is designed with fantastic LED screens and the elevator is simply wow
7248,4,Located close to lotte world park this area is full of LOTTE building and malls big mall mostly expensive products beautiful mall good restaurant you can visit this place after lotte world park
7249,5,We bought timed tix to see the sunset on the observation deck Then we were able to walk around the Mall and mart and have dinner before The way to the elevator is very cool and the elevator itself too The observation deck is fun and the view is really great It was not too crowded when we went since there are actually several floors to take in the view
7250,4,At the time of review this is South Koreas tallest building and the worlds 5th tallest building at 555m and 123 floors Naturally one would not want to miss out on an opportunity to stand at its observation deck on one of the top floors and it is with this determination that I have to part with a fairly hefty KRW 27000 entrance fees The top draw in the observation deck is undisputedly the glass bottom which truly tests your fear for heights and is not for the fainthearted The 360 degrees view from the top is spectacular but only if the weather is permitting The Lotte World Tower is attached to a modern shopping mall and an aquarium which will easily occupy your 1day itinerary Make no mistake this towering skyscraper is the epitome of Seouls push towards modernity
7251,5,Lotte Tower can be found outside the Jamil Station that is also close to Lotte World amusement park After buying the tickets there is a short walk through a security check then into rooms and corridors that have great video and pictures on the walls and sometimes on the ceilings The elevatorlift is rapid and also has a video display on the upper walls and ceilings The view from the tower is spectacular even on a misty day like the day we went There are more levels to go up and a small cafe that sells mostly ice creams A great place to visit if you have the time for some spectacular sights of Seoul and would be good around twilight
7252,5,Recently opened with easy access from ticketing through to security Didnt feel overly watched like I would in London which made it a nicer experience The views were absolutely incredible
7253,5,The views are spectacular and with over four floors of observation area there are plenty of different ways to overlook Seoul including a glass walk and outdoor terrace They offer a professional service which is reasonably priced and includes digital access via download on computer or smartphone with the purchase of any print We went with our son who was two years old children under 3 are free; he enjoyed looking out and walking around the observation area We would highly recommend this attraction to anyone visiting Seoul
7254,3,Average views Go there only if you are out of attractions to visit and if you are close by Its kind of far from most other attractions
7255,5,downstairs is the aquarium great shopping in the mall with lots of places to eat make sure you go to the observatory at the very top for spectacular views of Seoul 
7256,5,Good mall but the tower is the best part Must do and take your time going to every floor Cafe there to eat but we were there to watch a movie so didnt have time The glass floor part is the best part
7257,5,4 floors 360 degrees of viewing space cafe on 2 levels 1 floor has 2 sections with glass floors the floor above that you can go out side but the windows on the outside of the building are dirty but you still get a good views
7258,4,Incredible building very nice surrounding area  The building itself is spaciousstate of the art in every way  It is however expesnive and seems to be catering mostly towards those who are richer Nothing wrong with that but for me I just walk around there
7259,4,Visited the recently opened mall They have all your shopping needs inside Also you can take magnificent photograph outside the building There is a garden with a modern sculptor Definitely will visit again as the building is massive and not enough time to walk around
7260,3,It opened not long ago and yet the windows were very dirty so dirty that it shows on all the pictures No restaurants up there yet just some counter where you can buy some food and eat it while standing there with nowhere to sit You go up you look at the view nothing else to do than go back down The only cool thing is the glass floor in 2 place where you can stand on and see 1860 ft down
7261,4,Went there on a sunny Sunday afternoon There were quite a lot of people in line at the ticket counters as expected but since they were very efficient we just waited for about 10 minutes until we got our tickets Waiting time for the elevator was then another 15 minutes which was faster then assumed too  Adult ticket is 27000 WON 25 EUR26 USD Kids are about half price There is also an ExpressTicket for 50000 WON to pass the lines at the elevator etc  Going up by the high speed elevator is nice and just takes a minute  The multifloor observation deck has a coffee lounge photo stand souvenir shop and two glass bottom areas Also there are two outside terraces  Plan to spend about 45 minutes there on the top of the tower which is enough for sure to see everything  The modern elegant and big Lotte Mall itself is surely also nice to walk through however we just went for the Tower
7262,5,This is a must to do I highly recommend it I visited around 1030 in the morning and there where no lines at all Also nice to sit at the bar and have a champagne Employees very friendly
7263,4,This is one of the cleanest largest most varied shopping malls I have ever been to Though I am not much of a shopper I can appreciate the large variety of shops entertainment and restaurants available here The 5 story mall is organized by type of shop which is convenient For example there is a childrens section with 15 shops luxury goods take up an entire floor etc There are also many electronic directory kiosks available on each floor to help you find things The bottom floor has an excellent aquarium that would appeal to visitors of all ages There are also many options for dining both casual and fine restaurants This is a great place to spend a rainy day exploring shopping and eating It is easily accessible through the Jamsil subway station
7264,5,The experience in the elevator to 118 floor at high speed was exhilarating The glass bottom of the observatory tower is an interesting experience one should try standing on The views were breathtaking; definitely a place worth a visit
7265,5,Very nice place its a wonderful city full of all Condition vivamente di visitors Seoul is beautiful city full of surprises
7266,5,We visited the new tower The view of Seoul was amazing The glass bottom observation deck was cool but my girlfriend was too afraid to join me for a picture 
7267,4,This was a decent tourist attraction taking you to 5 stories of observation decks in the 5th tallest building in the world Unfortunatately Seoul is a bit hazy so even on te clearest day the view is not as impressive as it should be
7268,4,The Lotte World Mall is easy to reach via the Jamsil station of the Seoul metro And the subway station is connected to the mall making the connection even easier There are all kinds of stores and restaurants to spend your money including the nearby amusement park and the new Seoul Sky observatory
7269,5,Seoul sky which is in the Lotte world tower opened on April 3rd 2017 and is the 6th tallest building on the world and the tallest in Seoul Its worth every penny of approx 19 25 to go tothe observation deck 500 meters high There are a couple of cafes and the upmarket 123 Lounge where a chicken sandwich costs 22000 won or approx 15 sterling and similar price for a Caesar salad Both were presented beautifully and where else can you eat your lunch 500 metres above ground with fabulous views The service was excellent as was the experience As this becomes more popular expect to queue to get your tickets The mall at the basement goes to the 9th floor has the usual range of very expensive shop Chanel Hermes etc There is also an aquarium cinema and concert hall There are also plenty of restaurants and cafes but dont expect them to be cheap
7270,5,Just visited it 20170408 I am usually not info writing any kind of reviews but this time I had to The place i MUST visit for anyone who is visiting Seoul The view staff everything is just perfect Trip to observation deck cost 25 and if you are not sure if its worth it or you are just poor student skip your dinner but visit this place  Thank you Lotte for this experiance this was amazing good job 
7271,5,I saw this building under Construction last Januaru 2015 And its finally finished The Lotte World Tower is a 123floor 5545metre 1819 ft supertall skyscraper that finished external construction on March 17 2016 The buildings final 123rd floor was topped out on December 22 2015 It is currently the tallest building in the OECD and is the 5th tallest building in the world A must visit when your in Korea
7272,5,C1  20170321  Though this shopping mall had trouble while building but it was certain that there was very good landmark in this area after its completion There had many stores restaurant and things to do I think there was the best place to shopping in Seoul
7273,4,Spent a couple hours here in October 2016 Came for dinner then did some browsing Very large mall with lots of stores including a high end department store Many restaurants to dine at Part of a conglomeration of many malls in this area Easily accessible by metro Has a theme park too called lotte world Very bright clean and modern interior Column fountains reaching from floor to ceiling of one of the mall floors that illuminated in a rainbow of colours There are movie theatres as well PF Changs is here and we had dinner there
7274,4,This is a very large mall with cinema on the 7 floor It has two sections One high end foreign brand and another mid and local foreign Brands  There are the usual Zara and H M which offer tax rebate to tourist If you spent at the higher end Lotte world tower the tax rebate counter closed at 830 pm please note  Do need to allocate at least 2 hours or more to Walk and browse at the items and shops  We were here for a K pop  D O From EXO  meet and greet after the movie My annoying Brother It was quite an experience following my teenager who was so firm and determined to see her pop star
7275,5,Went here to catch lunch at the food court The mall has lots of high end shops but the B1 floor houses affordable to mid range brands as well They also have helpful directories near the escalators for tourists and those unfamiliar with the mall  There are lots of choices for food and shopping The restrooms are spacious and nicely equipped The malls is fairly close to the subway station and has a taxi lane near the LV entranceexit
7276,5,I hopped on the train for the day and randomly discovered this place as I missed my stop to see Olympic stadium at the sports complex stop I entered an enormous mall and continued to walk until I was outside What I discovered was the Lotte World Tower over 550 meters or 1800 feet The architecture in the area was modern and unique Just behind the world tower you can find Seokchon lake which has a walking track and you can appreciate the area from many angles Had I known about this place I would have grabbed some food and a drink as there are many areas to sit
7277,5,There are really good exchange rates in the wooribank its located on B1F in the thats the best part Krispy Kreme shop That part had a amazed me a lot Just look for Krispy Kreme and Hi Mart Mobile cant be missed its also opened on Sundays the other one is in the Seoul Main Station near the KTX gates
7278,3,Walked around after visiting Lotte World Lots of high end shops cafes and restaurants A familyfriendly place
7279,4,That is the highest building in south korea In 2016 sept This building still is constructing It will be higher The shopping mall surrounds the tower So you can do shopping and eating some foods Also you can see an amazing manmade lake in near the tower That lake has popular photo zone There is big stuff over the lake named the big moon Many people like to do selfie in close to the moon
7280,5,The Lotte World Tower is amazing The queen of Jamsil should be called haha Surrounded by Lotte Mall is a mustsee in Seoul
7281,2,in reality the onspot tax refund works only in a very limited amount of cases Today ive tried to claim my tax on spot in the Lotte World And quess what im only receiving it at the airport The rason being I had a Maser card with me and supposedly they will only do return with a MasterCard if you are leaving the country within 4 days I was said that they only accept visa cards to do cash refund if you plan to leave in more than 4 days My question why got the answer cause its Korea  P S it was an orange tax refund company
7282,3,The world tower and mall are certainly impressive to view as the architect has cleverly added a false perspective making the tower seem higher than it really is The mall is glittery and golden with slippery marble floors and a myriad of shopkeepers and outlest vying for the tourist dollar Myeongdong in Soeul has all the same stuff and at lower prices
7283,4,Many shops adventure parkamusement park restaurants department stores super amrkets aquarium cinema etc all of these attractions are in this spot Couple of days are required if you want to shop and look around the place Coex was like that before its renovation but now I feel that Lotte world mall tower area replaced it Even if the department store basement food court close around 2000 or 2030 other supermarkets are still open till midnight If you go before closing you can get very good quality food with discounted priace at the department basement If you have kids it is also good place to have fun at the adventure or aquarium
7284,5,this is a new and high end mall located near the Jamsil Station and Lotte World Amusement Park it is filled with international brand apparel and food
7285,4,Its possible to find almost anything at Lotte mall Lots of highend stores brandstores and international shops There are not that many quaint or special shops Would go elsewhere if your time in Seoul as a tourist is scarce What we found terrible and rather disturbing as Scandinavians was the treatment of the animals in a pet shop Small dogs in very small transparent boxes looked sad out of their cages This is not a way to treat dogs  and we were amazed that this was possible at an international mall Have never seen anything like it
7286,4,Visited this mall with my boyfriend It sells a lot of branded goods as well as other recognized but more affordable brands goods There are also a lot of restaurants and cafes in the mall The goods sold range from clothings bags electronic devices and many more Visit this mall once walk and look around it You might find something you need
7287,5, I went to an autograph session for writer Shin Kyungaes book Strange Albergue The cradle of knowledge When you come here you come across various ideas and logics I personally

7459,5, If I want to buy a book or problem book I go  Today with the problem book and the problem book and the problem book 
7460,5, It is a space where the love of books can be felt by both customers and the company It is hoped that it will continue to be preserved and maintained 
7461,4, I can buy books There are school supplies and the books were fun There are no places to sit so I have to stand up and read Please make a sitting mat 
7462,5, It is one of the few places that makes a city that smells of people 
7463,4, I have been visiting for a long time A variety of books and merchandise 
7464,5, A place to reflect on how many people are looking for books 
7465,2, The books are piled up in plastic so I cant see them Its better to buy online now 
7466,5, The signature scent is good the parking lot is good I go to Gwanghwamun even though it is close to Jamsil Kyobo 
7467,4, Still a lot of books There is a reason why there are so many visitors 
7468,3, A really long visit I wanted to preorder the book but the staff made me jump 3 times It was not a long visit 
7469,5, I saw the books I wanted to read and the music for the phrase cafe changed I often come with my child 
7470,5, I go to Kyobo in the neighborhood every day but there are so few types and there are very few sample books so I came to Gwanghwamun 
7471,4, There is nothing as wide as it is wide and there are many books and stationery Good to listen to if you need something to buy 
7472,4,Guide
7473,5, As well as a large bookstore there are stationery toys and display figures so it is good to go with children 
7474,5, There are many kinds of books and the staff are very friendly 
7475,4, Although there were not many people due to Corona it is still a good place to put down operating profit for books 
7476,4, There were a lot of different kinds of books and the staff was mostly friendly but there were some bad staff who were not the search bar was not enough it was good to have a parking lot and it was good that it 
7477,5, Its my favorite space It would be nice if the types of books were a little more diverse but there must be physical limitations 
7478,5, I like that you can purchase stationery for childrens toys as well as many books The location is good and you can see the big Iron Man 
7479,5, It is a Kyobo station that is easy to walk right off Gwanghamun It sells various things books and drinks The convenience facilities are good Please make sure to visit later 
7480,5, Not only books but also miscellaneous items so delicious to look at 
7481,5, There are a lot of phrases and there are a lot of guests 
7482,5, I really like it because there are a lot of cute props so this is my favorite style  
7483,4, Theres no better place to read a book than here  Lately its more like a shopping mall with lots of books than a bookstore 
7484,5, As Koreas representative bookstore transportation is good There are many places where you can read books The food in the restaurant tastes good too so I often fix my meals 
7485,5, I love Kyobo Bookstore I dont know where the time goes 
7486,5, There are many types of books but old books feel a lot of touch so I am a little reluctant to buy them 
7487,5, I also have to go to the bookstore sometimes Despite the Corona situation quite a lot of people visit the bookstore Reading Poet Na Taejoos Attempts 
7488,5, book viewing people watching changed my mind 
7489,4, The place where the elderly fatherinlaw who passed away 8 years ago regularly went to work and 20 years ago In the construction of Incheon International Airport 
7490,5, There are things to eat things to see and miscellaneous goods 
7491,5, We can see all the books we want and if you have any questions ask the bookstore staff and they will kindly tell you where they are There are a lot of texts so I cant bring my kids 
7492,4, It is one of the best bookstores spacious and comfortable 
7493,5, Its a good place to listen to whenever youre comfortable 
7494,5, It is a treasure trove of bookstores where you can expand your indirect knowledge 
7495,4, It is also Kyobo Bookstore but the male staff who guides the QR code at the entrance was so unfriendly and scary 
7496,5, Its close to my house so its my goto place to read a book It is a place I love 
7497,5, There are a lot of various books so its nice to be able to check the stock 
7498,5,good vibes and easy to access centrally located and plenty of things to do around the area Myongdeong is just minutes away and Insadong another few minutes walking distance away Lots of food bookshop is a great place for soaking in the literary scene in seoul and to sit and rest and read Joining the locals doing that makes it fun
7499,5,Just a spectacle Giant book store inside the mall; a fun stop while in Seoul Plenty of options for those who wish to purchase or just relax and enjoy the atmosphere
7500,5,Without doubt the biggest book store Ive ever seen including Barnes  Nobel in the USA Small English section but were in Korea Truly amazing to see how the experience is developed the cafes the associated offerings eg Mont Blanc store Retail at its best
7501,4,Probably biggest book store what Ive seen Not only books but parfumes DVD and CD electronics coffee shop etc Basically you can spent whole day in this book store without get bored Also goid selection of English language books available
7502,3,There is a huge variety of books here in fact same as similar shops everywhere in the world Possible to find books in English one good plus For stationary materials it is better and cheaper to enter smaller shops specific for stationary You will lose much less time Same is valid for other goods such as souvenirs wallets bags toys etc If you want to buy only book and have specific list enter and buy Otherwise you can become crazy in crowd As a summary other than huge variety of books nothing special
7503,5,This Book Store is amazing Its located at the Basement of the Kyobo Building The person at the Information Counter was so helpful and efficient She gave me a print out based on the info which I gave her Book Titles  ISBN Numbers in order for me to locate the books that I was looking for As I was pressed for time I went to the designated location but was too overwhelmed andI decided to ask their Book Concierge Counter for assistance The lady was so helpful and found the books which I was looking for very quickly If you love books this is a must place to visit I will definitely go again and spend at least a day in this Book Store
7504,5,We were recommended to visit the bookstore and music store by the Tourist Information Center I would recommend you to ask them for advice  superb service We were looking for some KPop albums as well as some specific stationery Kyoto bookstore with HotTracks music store inside are located at the basement and once you get there you will be amazed Through costs is relatively more expensive than Malaysia for the same items there are just a wide variety of things not seen else where  books Stationeries music albums
7505,5,This bookstore could give Taipeis Eslite a run for its money Its really big with everything from books and stationery to music and lifestyle items and gadgets Quite a wide selection of English books too But it was really really crowded on a Sunday afternoon Great place for browsing and buying but not so much for hanging out and reading
7506,5,Lovely bookstore  you can just find almost anything you need I went there for a TOPIK book But also there is an unspeakable number and shape of post it and other sorts of stickers which I also find amazing along with the kids Staff is friendly and helpful There is a restaurant there if you get hungry after having browsed all the stuff Every time I come to Korea I visit the bookstore I like it this much
7507,5,I always make it a point to stop by and inhale the scent of new books Its a bit short on space to sit and read but the atmosphere is cozy and the staff very helpful Plus its right of the square Great location
7508,5,its huge they have also a nice selection in English I really liked the atmosphere if your looking for something to read  that is definitely the place
7509,5,The selection of English fiction has greatly improved but still has a long way to go before it will compare with an English speaking country It does however have a really wide selection of Teaching materials for various languages The stationery variety available is unbelievable Whatever your heart desires you will find here There are also many other things available from jewellery to dolls to musiccds and lots more too many things to even remember There is also a wonderfully clean toilet available plus a mothers room A restaurant and a coffeejuice shop is also there with a fairly large amount of seating All in all it is somewhere you can happily spend an afternoon You will also find many students sitting there reading books they cant afford to buy
7510,4,So much to choose from Great feel Huge wooden table to read at Lots of variety and English books available too
7511,5,Im a one week trip in Seoul and was looking for English books for my baby I found this place on nearby attractions on TAs app Its literally a hidden treasure as its located in the basement of a huge skyscraper They have a huge collection of books and a section for children in English I bought six beautiful books for my child I recommend a visit as the surrounding is also nice with different eateries and cafes
7512,5,I spent my best time in Kyobo when I was student in Korea in 20132014 one of best places you should visit if you love books belive me or not for me the first place I should find in each city is its first and best books store so for Seoul this is the best one
7513,4,This place is more than a book store It is more like a minishopping center where you can find not only stationery books electrical appliances gadgets but also toys and bags Hottracks is inside too They provide small benches here and there for customers who like to linger around for a little bit If you are hungry there is a food court  The store is definitely an excellent place to fend off the afternoon heat and torrential rains It could get really crowded because of that and also the fact that it is connected to the subway I have also been to the one in Daegu too The Daegu store is smaller and not as crowded  If you decide to do some serious shopping there make sure that you bring your passport with you for the instant tax returns  credits spending 30000 won at one time It would be nice if they have a coffee shop there just like the one in Barnes and Noble
7514,5,If you love books and youre in Seoul Go to Kyobo  I used to looove going here to buy books since I was a kid Unfortunately I feel that with the passing of time the foreign book section is subtly becoming smaller and smaller but nevertheless its still the best choice to browse through and buy books  If you are to frequent your visits to the bookstore or if you live in Seoul Id recommend getting a Kyobocard for benefits and discounts  They have a big stationery shop and a cafeteriadining area within the bookstore in the Kyobo Bookstore
7515,5,Beautiful sensual aroma when you walk in makes you immediately warm to this place Besides large VBou selection of books theres CDs DVDs hifi gear gifts etc and a cafe and restaurant
7516,5,I think this the the one of the biggest book store in the world really Whenever I visit Korea I never fail to visit this bookstore because literally I could start to swim in the enormous stream of tens of thousands of books You will be able to find any book you want name it And it has a special place for kids also where they can really enjoy with their own books And yes it is accompanied with nice cozy cafes also  It is just at the center of Seoul Metropolitan City very near to the Kyoungbok Palace which is another mustsee attraction  I recommend
7517,4,This is biggest book store in kwanghwamoon seoul In kyobo bookstore you could seat chair or floor and read the book what you want comfortably also many things to see and buy If you feel hungry or thirsty you can find food court quite good place to spend time and around kyobo many restaurants and cafe
7518,5,Kyobo book store is one of the biggest book store I know worldwide It offers place to read and a wide range of book in English Spanish and French From fiction to business books Prices are also very good cause it has good promotions all the time
7519,3,Kyobo Book Store was a big book store in Gwanghwamun I went there by subway There were a lot of tourist attractions around the area hence after visiting the bookstore I went sight seeing
7520,5,It is the place to see how much people in Seoul love to read Many cute stationery and gifts to buy too
7521,5,I love Kyobo bookstore because they have a GIGANTIC selection of books music stationary gamestoys etcyou really could spend all day here if you enjoy books Im not a fan of the ereader I like the feel of turning a page If you share this feeling venture into a Kyobo its a chain the next time youre in Korea Bookstores are a dying industry at least where I live so its truly nice to be in a place with stacks and stacks of books covering a wide range of topics All the Kyobo bookstores Ive been to including this one at the edge of Gwanghwamun Square has multiple levels so be sure to visit each level to pick up a book and some kpop CDs andor stationary to keep you entertained during your travels
7522,5,This store is huge It also has a fairly extensive range of books written in English I love browsing through their classics section I was so excited the last time I went because Jules Vernes around the world in 80 days was on sale for 3000
7523,5,I love wandering through this book store The have a decent section of English books and around the outside you can find anything from pens and notebooks to candles watches and cool little knickknacks
7524,5,This is one of my favorite places when I visit Seoul This is my 4th visit I bought lovely stationary items CDs and good books 1 hr is not enough
7525,5,Theres a myriad of stationary home goods and of course books Its an excellent place to buy a nice souvenir from Korea a local cookbook in English beautiful stationary there is a lot a LOT its a heaven for stationary lovers You can have a nice coffee while enjoying the books you just bought Its a walking distance from the castle and connected to the metro station If you are a book lover you cant miss this spot
7526,5,Its a really huge book store I think you will need 2 or more day to observe this place well When i first time came there i was so impressed by its size because we dont have such HUGE bookstores in our country Like this place
7527,5,I havent seen the tripadvisor Kyobo link for Gagnam so this is a review for the Gangnam location Its attached directly to Sinnohyeon Subway Station This place is huge Like pretty bighuge If youve ever seen a Virgin Records store or similar thats what I would compare Kyobo to I dont speak the language but thats okay I just visited to be around booksand there were many The stationery portion is way better than Ive seen in any Barnes  Noble in the US It has items for kids and grown up crayons for adults They even had an art section with oil paints luxury counters selling special writing tools Mont Blanc Parker FaberCastell and other minivendors selling accessories I saw a plethora of headphones from Shute personal speakers from Ultimate Ears and nice sales as well The prices are out of this world great and customer service was levels above what Ive seen in most stores in any country For instance I was approached quite a few times with a basket to unload all the trinkets Id been collecting in my hands I will definitely be going to the Kyobo in Gwanghamun but one shouldnt rest in their laurels to see the one in Gangnam Not to mention that strip in the area is international and fun to people watch Most customers of the nearby California Pizza Kitchen had bad from Kyobo Go
7528,5,Spent a whole afternoon in the book store Has best stationery items I like the reading area very much It is part of the places to visit every time I am in Seoul
7529,5,This book store is massive If you are looking for English books come here The selection is incredible New releases to classics cooking to text books its all here For such a massive store it was interesting the location is not more clear There is a small sign directing you to B1 at the lobby of the building
7530,4,This bookstore is unbelievable It connects to the subway purple line 5 at Gwanghwamun Station If you are a book worm stationary lover music enthusiast or just plain curious about how big a bookstore can really be I recommend coming here They have books for everything and also provides an exceptional English section of books The stationary is so unique and fun while the music section has a great layout and options to pick from Relax and enjoy the Cafe inside after youve looked around it gets tiring as there are tons of people there and then stroll through all the random goods they sell Definitely a place to stop through before going to Gwanghwamun square and Gyeongbokgung Palace which are at the same stations Not your typical bookstore
7531,5,Gotta conpare the size to Barnes and Noble back homethis place is huge and has it all I usually go to the kyobo bookstore in Jamsil station which is great too
7532,5,The sheer size of this place is amazing huge It has all kinds of books ststionary and everything else you would expect to find in a bookstore  If you love books you have to come here  My problem was that when I was there no one spoke English even the lady who was stationed at the English speakig desk couldnt spwak English  And the prices are a bit high Otherwise it is the place to buy books in Korea
7533,5,If you are Books  Stationary Lover dont miss this place There are a lot of books  stationary to buy All of the stationary are good quality and not expensive A lot of cute  lovely things to bring back home
7534,5,Huge bookstore with a large English section Lots and lots of nice stationery There are also cafes and food outlets within the bookstore Enjoyable experience
7535,5,Theres definitely not enough signs for the bookstore from the outside but it definitely worth looking for underground Plenty of books in foreign languages and wide variety of stationery brands Awesome bathroom too 
7536,4,a summer resort in the city
7537,5,2 expositions absolument divine en 2 heures Dont une sur la metahorizons Et lautre de Tim burton 
7538,5, Exhibition Name Tim Burton Special Exhibition Venue DDP Learning Center Design Exhibition Hall  Period 22430912 
7539,5,Tim Burton exhibit was incredible Awesome place
7540,5, You can see everything about Tim Burton Great exhibition and wonderful from DDP We could see the building at the same time 
7541,2,Very confusing corridors xs where to go
7542,5, A place to spend a cool day enjoying the design on a hot day 
7543,5, Ive never been there before but theres a lot more to see than I thought There are paid exhibitions such as the Tim Burton exhibition and there are also 
7544,5,A very interesting place at a busy area of Seoul so many options of cafes restaurants bars and stores around it Its thrilling to think that a baseball field once lied there instead of the DDP
7545,5, I went to the Tim Burton exhibition Its good to just watch the exhibition as it flows 
7546,5,art is subjective but i think most people will like the exhibitions and overall design of this plaza i like it thats why i rated it 5 
7547,5,Its free and you can relax
7548,1,This is a very nice place and big surrounding many reknown shopping market
7549,5, I saw the Dali exhibition ate lamb skewers at a nearby Russian restaurant and ate dessert at a rolling pin 
7550,5,Very nice building it is world famous
7551,3, Its good to see but the bus access nearby is very disappointing 
7552,3, I came here for the first time before seeing a movie at Dongdaemun Megabox But in the movie time I just go and look around 
7553,3, For firsttime visitors the building guide seems to be too confusing 
7554,5,A great place to hang out and look at art exhibitions that may suit your taste
7555,5, It is a pleasant place with its exterior and interior architecture We went to the Tim Burton exhibit here Lets go  
7556,5,Beautiful Architecture
7557,5, It takes over an hour from Suwon by public transportation An exhibition I watched with my daughter after a long time 
7558,5,Zaha Hadids masterpiece is a spectacle to watch Its just mesmarizing There are enough amenitis for every designer It facilitates and inspires For Seoul this magnifient architecture works as a global landmark
7559,5,Massive magnificently designed building with a few exhibitions inside the structure itself is the real showpiece here though at night it looks ever better
7560,5, Clean spacious and close to the subway  Going to see the Tim Burton exhibition there were a lot of people in the exhibition hall so it was crazy 
7561,5,good place to visit
7562,5, There are practically no permanent exhibitions like the National Museum of Art in Tokyo there are only special exhibitions and the admission fee is expensive but beware of the price 
7563,5,Its a free spot to go and check out a neat building They also hold exhibits there too Right now is tim burton until september of this year
7564,3, It was good because there were no people It was very special to see the building design 
7565,3,Its more like museum and relaxing place Not much things to do
7566,4, It was good because it was close to the subway station but I thought that it might be a bit difficult for firsttime visitors to get in and out of it 
7567,2, Two rooms were closed Location not very obvious as to discovery such as traffic Unclear layout and path 
7568,1, I paid 11000 won and it came out in 5 minutes Nothing to see I recommend it to people with a lot of money but I heard a lot of the air conditioner popping so it was great to hear so much 
7569,5,A visiter
7570,5,Very beautiful place 
7571,4,exceptional structure
7572,5, The photo zone in the basement is beautiful so its good to take pictures and its good to sit and talk 
7573,5, There was a sudden power outage because it rained a lot so I was embarrassed 
7574,2,I dont know whats all the hype about this place To call a building futuristic or shaped like a spaceship is just another way of saying its not organized and easy to get lost in I didnt understand whats the point of this 
7575,5,Very good experience  Visited for the Tim Burton Expo I was surprised in a good way 
7576,4, First visit to Dongdaemun Design Plaza After seeing the special exhibition I moved to the other building and got lost because it was my first visit 
7577,5,I really love the design of this public space that allows people to spend time with their family relax appreciate arts and stay dry during the rainfall
7578,5,I have been to the DDP and the Tim Burton exhibition
7579,4,An amazing design provided by Zaha Hadid You feel there the sense of space  while you move it takes you through a journey of different feelings 
7580,5, This is a large plaza It is a multispace for all events and exhibitions 
7581,5, I saw Tim Burton It is so popular that you can see it in line even on weekdays 
7582,5, It is an exotic and wonderful space in the shape of a spaceship Corona is getting better and better but it would be better if there were more 
7583,5,State of the art design building There is a design museum inside too And a small shop selling cute accessories
7584,2,They need to announce that 10000 won for admission is for the museum only
7585,5, There are various activities and exhibitions There are many households and the architecture is beautiful 
7586,3, It is recommended to stop by near the sea Its hard to get directions Restaurants are expensive 
7587,5,Super clean and interesting site
7588,5,Amazing building not to be missed
7589,5, The work of famous architect Zaha Hadid is characterized by an atypical space concept and the interior is also irregular giving the impression of exploring a spaceship 
7590,5, The building is beautiful and there are many things to see 
7591,4, The exterior of the building that was raised after erasing the history looks great The building is separate from each other there is no connection and cooling and heating are difficult It is inconvenient to use as 
7592,5, I watched the Tim Burton special exhibition  Tim Burtons Biography and Sketches Modeling Film Animation 
7593,5,SHHEEEEEEEEEEESHH
7594,5, The restaurant district is very depressed right now The night market food truck which used to be a specialty is not operating Its good to take a walk while looking around the wonderful buildings wonderful 
7595,3,A unique place to roam around take some pictures and   chill at the same time
7596,5, The building is a wonderful structure with curves and straight lines 
7597,5,Eye opening place about future life
7598,5, This is the DDP exhibition hall I visited for the first time in 2 years due to Corona After Keith Haring 
7599,4, Very good It is spacious and there are many places to lie down and rest and it is recommended However it can be easy to get lost and it can be difficult to find the desired 
7600,5,Amazing place Enjoyed a lot
7601,5,The amazing architecture itself is worth the visit I went for the Tim Burton exhibition here in June 2022 which is very well put together I think there used to be some food trucks night market during the weekends but it stopped coz of the pandemic Worth a visit
7602,5, The clothes at Jeil Pyeonghwa Market are also wholesale prices so it was cheap and good 
7603,3, Its complicated and the exhibitions are good but theres nothing to eat or play after its finished 
7604,5,Good
7605,3,dot
7606,3, There is little food and little to see Nothing to see unless you go to a special exhibition; 
7607,4, I came to see the Tim Burton special exhibition The exterior of the building was very impressive 
7608,4, Various cultural experiences relaxation and healing are possible Parking fees are high so it is recommended to use public transportation for a 
7609,5, I went for the Tim Burton exhibition and I was surprised that it was so much better than I expected There is a space where you can lie down on the second floor and read a book so it was a great comfort during a 
7610,5,The world of Tim Burton
7611,4,Place to visit Unfortunately we didnt make it in time for Tim Burton exhibition But the building is really cool
7612,5,Never fail to please with their exhibitions and the architectural brilliance of Zaha Hadid
7613,5, landmarks in seoul You can see various exhibitions Great place for a date while walking 
7614,5,Nice place to visit Shows different exhibitions regularly The one at the time I visited was about Tim Burton
7615,5,Nice place to nap Lol
7616,1,please no more beautiful and useless architectures Zaha Hadid Seoul city has been struggling and wasting large amount of money to find its usages so far
7617,5, I went to Tim Burtons special exhibition Its interesting 
7618,5,Cool spot
7619,5, I went to the Tim Burton exhibition but everything was good except the order of the docents I heard through the app was jumbled up 
7620,5,So amazing design of architecture SM Town store at 1 floor D5 Seating area is very good Toilet facilty  mobile charger
7621,5, A complex cultural space designed by worldfamous architect Zaha Hadid Formerly Dongdaemun Stadium There are people who criticize the uniqueness of the area called Dongdaemun and the lack of historicity of the 
7622,5, Good Place Artistically very well built there is a lot to see and to visit 
7623,5, I have doubts about the space utilization but it looks great for various viewing events or a place for citizens to relax The day I went there was a Tim Burton exhibition 
7624,5, I went to the Tim Burton special exhibition There are too many visitors so if you want to see it in detail I recommend weekdays The exhibition itself covering all Tim Burtons works was good 
7625,4,pretty modern architectural building like for the futureout of space day time is nice and night time is also pretty nice place to just walk and sit go inside to check it out if you have time
7626,5, I came to watch Tim Burtons game Its not like the old Dongdaemun Speaking of the market it is Pyeonghwa Market and Bangsan Market ddp is cool 
7627,5, It seems to be an environment where you can get inspiration when you appreciate the exhibition 
7628,5, A strange building in the middle of Seoul Nevertheless a building that exquisitely fits the Seoul landscape 
7629,5,Great place for art exhibitions and families There are lots of fun activities and shops
7630,5,Amazing piece of art by ZHA as usual
7631,4,Visited the kids cafe indoor playground on the fourth floor which our 4yearold absolutely loved However DDP as a whole is more adult friendly with cafes and shops inside the building Plus if you are interested in architecture the 
7632,3, A building where it is difficult to find a straight line Everything inside and outside is curved 
7633,4, The exhibition structure is good The unfortunate thing is that the business district seems to have been wiped out after Corona 
7634,4, I think Ive seen more than 5 exhibitions at DDP but theres never been a time without people very many The building is large so you always have to ask the desk where they are exhibiting 
7635,4, Its quiet spacious and nice A lot has changed from before The toilet is also clean 
7636,5,Edifice
7637,5, A very complete store sells everything from food to furniture for the house 
7638,5, When you come out of the entrance connected to the subway you are faced with a huge space Designed by Zaha Hadid Architects the buildings presence is overwhelming 
7639,5, There are too many people haha Still I like it because it has plenty of space to sit and lie down 
7640,4,Reminded me a lot of the Guggenheim in Bilbao Beautiful structure with some food and shops
7641,5,Hen Ho
7642,5, A place where you can create wonderful memories  
7643,5, Lets go take a look once in a while Tim Burton is fighting 
7644,5,Korea
7645,3, Its spacious and clean Theres a lot of empty space 
7646,5, Tim Burton If you are curious be sure to visit the exhibition  
7647,5, A place where I enjoyed watching the Tim Burton exhibition and bought small souvenirs I tasted threecolor curry at a curry restaurant I took out iced coffee from a bakery and drank it in the plaza in May when it 
7648,2, the center is aesthetically and architecturally fantastic it is a pity that it is practically an empty box  something is there but compared to what has been built and spent it is scandalous 
7649,5, Even if you dont know Tim Burton well If you follow the flow of the exhibition An exhibition that can be fully enjoyed with many popular elements 
7650,4, Tim Burton Exhibition Good Good It was an exhibition that could be inspired and stimulated 
7651,5,Always beautiful
7652,5, You can feel the charm of a different building There was a Tim Burton exhibition Im very satisfied with it 
7653,3,Easy to get to as it has its own metro stop Interesting design with little outside exhibits Near a market area so you can have local street food after visiting
7654,4, It is a cultural space where various exhibitions are held and it is a historic site with traces of Igansumun and Dongdaemun Stadium I heard that it was criticized for not taking advantage of the meaning of 
7655,5, theres a lot to see it was good 
7656,3, I go when there is an exhibition but there is nothing to do inside except for the exhibition They all go around 
7657,3, Its a pity that the space is not being used well I would like to create a space where you can exercise various physical strength through a oneday class with new writers in various fields and make it a place 
7658,3, There is not enough information about the exhibition and the coffee shop is also costeffective

7686,5, Its wide and there are a lot of shopping malls But there are a lot of shops that are closed due to Corona 
7687,1, The location of the exhibition hall is not confirmed There is no guide Parking is expensive 
7688,5, Visited to see Salvador Dali The quarantine pass was gone and social distancing was not implemented so it was difficult to see the work properly because many visitors came from the moment

7690,5, I went to see the Gucci exhibition I wish there was more to see

7695,5,Great place to stop by

7707,5, I visited because there was a Dalijeon and it was stylish and there were many things to see around it 
7708,5, Its a place I visit often but its a place I admire every time I go 
7709,4, Ive seen the exhibition Its a bit complicated structure so I think more information boards are needed I think there are a few restaurants so its good to use them 
7710,3, It was nice to understand Dali well and to plan well so that I could get to know his work better But 
7711,5,A nice place to walk around and enjoy the wonderful architecture of Seoul Its bustling with people but there are nooks and corners that are Instagram worthy

7722,4, I saw it before genius dali 
7723,5, I went to the Gucci exhibition I love various exhibitions 
7724,3, It is a wonderful place to contain the current culture but a place that is somewhat disappointing to see that it has melted the history of the past 
7725,5, The architecture is like the work of Salvador Dali Its like surrealism 
7726,5, I enjoyed watching the exhibition The exhibition is no joke 
7727,5, Salvador exhibition is open Its a great place to see the exhibition 
7728,3, There are a lot of interesting exhibitions but it is really hard to find your way inside COEX in Euljiro 
7729,4, After watching Dali I used the cafe next door I like that it is convenient for both the train and the bus It is also convenient to use the nearby Dongdaemun Shopping Mall 
7730,4, I enjoy watching the exhibition But there are too many people 
7731,4, Its so hard to find the way Its pretty but I wonder if it suits the city 
7732,5, I was shocked to see Dalis various works I recommend it to those who havent been 
7733,5, The night view is beautiful and it is located in the middle of walking distance to the surrounding tourist attractions in Seoul If you are tired it is a good place to go to another place by public transport 
7734,5, I went to see Dali Its nice to have a hot exhibition 
7735,5, A very stunning modern building which combines shopping culture and art I highly recommend it to anyone who comes to Korea 
7736,4, There are many things that have been reduced due to Corona but the Salvador Dali exhibition was really fun and good 
7737,4, Watch Salvador Dalis match Its difficult because Im a surrealist writer I didnt even think about the entrance fee 
7738,5,Nice place
7739,5, Ive been to the Dali exhibition  The unique concept of the exhibition was quite memorable 
7740,5, Dali went because of the exhibition Ive been to Ddp a few times but I think its a really nice building Proud to be in Seoul 
7741,5, The DDP space itself is a very nice building Admire the exhibition of Salvador Dali on display at the learning center Good composition and good display 
7742,5, I went to see the Dali exhibition As it turns out you are a genius who runs Later generations of ordinary people applauded the seals when they saw the work I really liked this work 
7743,4,The night scenery here is like visiting an alien world
7744,4, A space that deserves at least one in a busy city center 
7745,5, After a pleasant viewing at DDP Dongdaemun Design Plaza with art and jazz lovers I have been enjoying happiness with a delicious cup of tea at the Cha Cha Tea Club 
7746,5, The space is interesting Feeling protected or trapped Dali now 
7747,4,A lot of things are closed now due to covid so its not as cool as it used to be
7748,5, Its right in front of the station so its easy to access and the building is pretty 
7749,4,So design and futuristic environment
7750,5,Dali Van Picasso and Rimin
7751,4, Its nice that the wonderful and worthwhile exhibitions continue but Im not familiar with the structure of the DDP Dongdaemun Design Plaza so Im a bit lost every time I go If you stay until sunset you can 
7752,3, It was a little disappointed If I was a weekday A few years ago I saw the Pornanase Exhibition in this place but it was the 
7753,3, When I went there were a lot of closed stores inside and I only saw Dalijeon I think the inside content was a bit stale when I went before 
7754,4, Visit Dicky Dicky The facility is quite old Well twice 
7755,1, It was nice to see the museum staff laughing chatting and running around in life Especially the sound of Kakaotalk and phone calls are very helpful to increase the concentration on the viewing It makes me worry 
7756,5, Salvador Dali was being played at DDP so I went there It was so big I couldnt see all of it but as an exhibition hall the transportation and location were good 
7757,5,Multi flex space in seoul
7758,4, I went to the Ferris wheel before Dali Since it was a weekend I waited about 50 minutes to get a ticket The exhibition had a lot more works than other exhibitions and it was an

7761,5, Ive been watching Dali I also liked the wellstructured composition and work It always seems like a good place because of the convenient transportation 
7762,1, Disappointment before Dali He took a few pictures and mocked the audience There is no such scam I got a refund but the admission fee was ripped off 
7763,5, clean and comfortable very good exhibition 
7764,5, Many places are empty due to corona It is a place that has become a symbol in itself and is a good place for frequent exhibitions 
7765,5, Go to see many exhibitions There are many free exhibitions and the night view is beautiful 
7766,5,Outstanding
7767,4, Beautiful Architecture It is inevitable that it is inconvenient to have experience with such a building 
7768,5, A gourmet restaurant All menu items are delicious 
7769,5, I saw the Salvador Dali exhibition here today and it was fun but there were too many people 
7770,1, I saw the Dali exhibition at the design exhibition hall and I was offended by the unfriendly staff It was inconvenient because the guide was broken but there was no apology I dont think I will go to the DDP 
7771,5, The match against Salvador Dali is going on until 320 The installation and atmosphere inside the exhibition hall are good and neat The explanation is relatively concise so there are some memorable parts of what 
7772,5, There was an exhibition going on and there was a lot to see 
7773,3, I just went to see the Dali exhibition but it was an exhibition that was too crowded and difficult to appreciate 
7774,5, The kids cafe on the 4th floor is spacious and good to play 
7775,5,One of the best place in Seoul
7776,5,Beautiful place to visit and an amazing location to do your shopping
7777,5,It was really Good experience You can see different art galleries Seoul light is something very attractive to see but you cannot see it every day It is available on nights of special occasions
7778,3, neat and nice But I cant get a guide on where it is 
7779,5, As a center of Seoul culture various exhibitions are held throughout the year so you can have a good time at any time of the year The building itself is a sight to behold and it is large and beautiful enough to 
7780,5, Performance exhibition in progressFashion MeccaA good place to go anytime 
7781,3, I went to the game against Salvador Dali It was a bit disappointing for me who visited the Figueres Museum of Art in Spain but it was good to be introduced to Korea like this Even on a weekday 
7782,4,Not too bad
7783,5,This place is like from a different planet or from a science fiction movie You can see a thousands of pictures but nothing is like the reality It will hit your eyes your brain and your heart but you will still not easy to believe what 
7784,4, Seoul Light Garden of Light In the Corona era we can applaud and comfort each other and laugh 
7785,5, I was very satisfied with Dalis work but the planning was very good 
7786,5,One of the impressive and attractive piece of landmark DDP located in Seoul city which is designed by the late architect Zara Hadid in March 2014
7787,5, Memories of the old Dongdaemun Stadium nice exhibition hall 
7788,4, It is a spacious exhibition hall located in the heart of the city It is surprising that the old Dongdaemun Baseball Stadium has been transformed into the present space The space is spacious so it feels like a park 
7789,5,With a visit i as it is so unique They have a Dali exhibit until March of 2022 that is first rate of course there is massive wholesale shopping right next door which is fun as well
7790,5,I wish there was a space for waiting in the building
7791,5,Good place
7792,5, The night view is beautiful and there are many exhibitions good for a date 
7793,3, Its interesting and fun but I hope the sights will be renewed in a variety of ways 
7794,5, visit to dali It was nice to be able to come and see things to see in other places because it came through KakaoTalk so that I could know the waiting number 
7795,3, The viewing space itself is good but most of the stores are still vacant so there are too few places to eat or see around 
7796,5,Always enjoy going DDP
7797,4, Salvador Dalis battle takes about 2 hours to see well Lots of spectators for the space 
7798,5, The space is full of ideas Just visiting is exciting and refreshing 
7799,5, 2021 Seoul Light to be held at Dongdaemun Design Plaza ddp Black space green Seoul white ecosystem red energy and vitality blue 
7800,5, The parking lot is spacious there are many places to eat and the exhibition is useful and good but the parking fee is a bit expensive 
7801,1,A waste of tax money in a desolate field
7802,4, Otherwise the exhibit was good It was a bit inconvenient because there was no restaurant in the DDP 
7803,4, It looks great from the outside and the route is comfortable 
7804,5, Its a multiplex so there are a lot of events and its pretty 
7805,5, It was my first visit but the building is beautifully decorated and there are many design related exhibitions and shops so there are many things to see 
7806,5, good unique building structure I dont fit in well with my surroundings 
7807,4, I came to see the Salvator Dali exhibition Most of the exhibitions at DDP seem to go over the middle but this Dali exhibition was disappointing that there were no famous works 
7808,4,Its modern and very stylish building
7809,5, I went to the Hong Kong Manga Fair the Dali exhibition was too expensive 
7810,3,Didnt get to experience the whole place but it was great to sit down after a long walk around the city
7811,5, At the time of this experience I went to the Salvador Dali exhibition and the exhibition was good It was not to mention the dignity of DDP but it would be nice if there were more things to enjoy in the internal 
7812,5, Too many people before 300 people on standby in front of me; 
7813,4, It was nice to be able to see the exhibition Transportation is very convenient 
7814,5, Salvador Dali Its amazing to see 
7815,4, I went because of the exhibition the building is so pretty Because the building is large there were various exhibitions and various 
7816,4, Its a nice place but its too far for me The Shack Shack burger in front is delicious 
7817,4, Early bird discount on admission ticket KRW 18000 40 minutes waiting for entry 2 places to take photos before the exhibition 
7818,5, good good good 
7819,4,Yes the structure is stunning Amazing architecture Great atmosphere and lots going on However expected more in terms of exhibitions This changes throughout the year Some boutique shops inside and eateries I just think they could have made better use of the indoor space Clean and well kept Definitely recommend going
7820,4,Interesting art pieces around the plaza Inside is a museum with special exhibits at times Right outside is the Seoul City Tour double decker bus which you can buy a ticket for to enjoy sites around the area
7821,4,DDP is Zaha Hadid design and definitely the icon of Dongdaemun There are a couple of subway stations that stop directly underneath or nearby hence easy to get to The Plaza overall is quite large in size with shops exhibitions and art installations There are leaderboards with maps in many locations hence easy to find your way around Nearby DDP are underground shopping night markets Dongdaemum Gate a couple fo hotels and plenty of shops and restaurants Dongdaemun and DDP are must visit sights when in Seoul
7822,5,Zaha Hadids Dongdaemun Design Park Plaza is the highlight of my trip to South Korea We arrived in the evening and there was a performance with music and high tech projections on the walls of the building We really felt like being in the center of arts and technology Breathtaking  Strongly recommend
7823,5,I enjoyed a really lovely and romantic despite being by myself walk through this area late one evening All of the shops were closing up including the street vendors but it was still great for an evening stroll
7824,5,I visited there two times The structure of this architecture is so dynamic that I felt like Im in city rather than architecture It was memorable
7825,4,I went there two times AM and PM The night scenery is so beautiful So many places to take photos Outside the building there are roses being displayed actually for kdrama shooting but somehow they left it there as it become famous with tourists I would like to recommed coming here during the night
7826,2,For me it was a bit disappointing visiting S Korea I can feel a bit of tension wherever I would go around the city The people were not as warm as expected I dont know if it was due to a language barrier or they were just not trying to be nice Im Caucasian and my wife is Japanese and at a lot of places we went I didnt really enjoy myself It was our first time visiting But as for me I probably wont go back again This is my opinion
7827,4,Definitively worth a visit especially if you are interested in design and arts Depend on what exhibition will be held during your visit but even without interesting exhibition you can visit the building during a sunny day
7828,3,From the outside amazing architecture; just simply amazing but as soon as you step inside the magic disappear rapidly  The space seems to be very poorly used and there is so little design that you wonder where you are  So much potential totally wasted
7829,5,Weird and cool architecture just walk around outside and inside for awhile and get lost Some cool exhibits food and shops
7830,4,Nothing much here but nice walk around It surroundings by few shopping complex which offering various types of things There is food truck night market and performances during weekend if not mistaken Please check before you go
7831,4,Modern building interesting construction rice lights every nights them exhibitions almost every month Just see it
7832,5,There is very little I can tell you about this outstanding and gorgeous piece of engineering and architecture Designed by world renowned architect Zaha Hadid who is an IraqiBritish citizen  The place has conveniently allocated metro entrances beneath the structure I think 3 to be precise Before you get to the building there is a mayor plaza and a walking streetramp that leads you to the heart of it The entrance is beneath the full structure  The DDP of its name means Dongdaemun Design Plaza DDP has the meaning of Dream Design and Play as far as I was informed The place is also famous and renowned for it has staged diverse cultural events including exhibitions fashion shows product launch shows forums and conferences  DDPs exterior features over 40000 aluminum panels none of which are the same As I mentioned before the plaza is home to various exhibition spaces design museum sky lounge rest area and a souvenir shop  Is really a beauty of Art and Architecture as well as Technology We recommend it for a casual visit to attend an event or if you are all of the above; artist architect or engineer Youll be mesmerized
7833,3,DDP LED Rose Garden is closed when we get there  So frustrated not to find it while thinking that it should be where it should be Didnt get any review or advise online that it will be closed so sharing this post which hopefully would help those who plan to go to DDP to see this LED Rose Garden Please check operating hours or any announcement before you go
7834,3,The website or its advertising stresses to get here at dusk However by dusk only a few shops are open The Plaza would be busier if your opening times were more precise Architecturally the structure is definitely worth visiting the design is exciting and futuristic The interior seems unfinished and lacking in spatial flow
7835,4,Nice place to just sit by the steps and enjoy the cold Great for taking pictures as well  Occasionally they have exhibitions here but unfortunately when we went it was already over
7836,5,such an amazing architecturea piece of art and history by Zaha Hadid where the future meets fantasy design takes your breath away Free admittance other than into galleries and class Feel free to walk in and dont trip while your head will be looking up at amazing futuristic style of design and down at the assymetric stairs etc cool cafes inside art classes bookstore seating areas plenty to do
7837,3,Will not visit again Interesting building design from the outside but boring on the inside Noting much to do inside
7838,4,They have Dongdaemun show every night during the winter break  To have artistic show projected on the enormous surface of the Iraqi American designed structure was a sight to behold
7839,5,Excellent gallery beautiful building worldclass art We went during winter and it was great to have some time away from the cold
7840,5,A truly impressive futuristic sci fi looking complex that deserves a wow factor on first impression especially if you just exited the subway stop The grounds and surrounding area are massive you could easily spend two days exploring this area as it also includes historical Dongdaemun wall and gate parkway etc The DDP is an art gallery design complex that has numerous spaces and rooms for outdoor performances and conferences Another interesting factor that there are archelogical finds surrounding the complex area that was unearth during construction and this has been integrated into the overall area This is an outstanding architectural design complex that is impressive when viewed both during the daylight and evening hours
7841,5,This beautifully designed building is part of the Design Plaza with regularly exhibitions and performances There is a small food court area and with few cafes around the basement level of the Plaza It is also a good place to wait for the HopOn HopOff tour buses which makes DDP their main stop for both lines Right across the street and surrounding areas are 56 large department stores some which are opened till 45am
7842,4,Vast building designed by Zaha Hadid covering a few city blocks Definitely worth a visit Various shops and galleries inside and usually a lively market outside
7843,3,The building design itself is interesting Sloping corridor to get to the various levels that locate the museum  From the outside it looks like a gigantic docked spaceship It has two sections the design plaza on one side and a museum on the other  When you are done the shopping is simply overwhelming This is the place for those that do not fancy the bazaar style shopping as in Namdaemun market This place has a few big malls for fashion mostly It has even has two underground shopping malls One at the main street and the other is adjoining the Metro station  Good for photo opp and place to shop
7844,3,The structure of DDP itself loks futuristic something like out of a Star Trek movie However there are not many shops in there and can look deserted I guess you have to appreciate art or design for me there is not much to see except the structure itself
7845,4,The architectural facade of DDP is very unique Outside the building is a good place for watching people and drinking coffee
7846,2,It is a iconic piece of architecture on a monumental scale It was a huge disappointment though there was almost no content and so much of the museum space was closed or empty The shopping area was billed as a design market it was not at all curated as design goods The remains of historical buildings in and amongst the futuristic mega buildings were the most interesting parts of the park Overall the sheer bleakness of the interior was fascinating but I was very frustrated at the lack of museum content The one small exhibit gallery with exhibits in it was okay but not of a scale to fit this giant park So be aware that besides the giant swooping building there isnt anything else to see  The central stair in the design building is amazing there is some striking architecture
7847,5,Beautiful artistic architecture that houses a museum a kids playground a gift shop and underground shopping mall Take the lift up to the roof top and strolled down the ramp while admiring the wonderful view
7848,4,Located in the heart of Seoul this Plaza certainly stands out for its futuristic design Theres a small museum nearby that goes into great detail about the flood control measures that have been implemented Some ruins have been preserved as well
7849,5,Also caled DDP This space ship is a major urban and most iconic landmark in Seoul Build by Zaha Hadid Architects this neofuturistic eccentric compkex is a multipurpose cultural center with galleries event spaces design shops and lawns that rise up to its roof Here is the perfect place to shop 24hour high quality goods
7850,5,Its too cold to truly enjoy the outside of the structure  Great to see the place Luckily there are indoor place to eat and some small shopstore  I didnt buy anything there Also good to sit around have some snacks
7851,5,Visit exhibitions  souvenir shops  enjoy a cup of coffee or a meal in this mega structure  DDP is an architectural beauty that was design by the queen of the crazy structures the late Zaha Hadid Its not your typical exhibition center its a place that you can do multiple activities in while enjoying this crazy structural beauty in a district that never sleeps
7852,3,This building symbolises modem South Korea with its futuristic design The building  is lighted up in the night Inside is a  kind of shopping mall with shops restaurants and halls for exhibitions and cultural programs 
7853,5,Very nice to walk around and see this very modern building Nice and not so big shopping mall as well
7854,3,The design is breathtaking  and very massive The surrounding areas offer a lot of cool shopping and eating spots
7855,5,This area is one of the best place to shop but this time we went here to enjoy the cold weather and take lots of pictures here Truly a wonderful place for photography
7856,5,I stopped by at the DDP at nighttime with some friends and it was a great visit The architectural design of the plaza itself is so unique and definitely worth some photos I believe they tend to have some exhibits are art programs here sometimes but youll have to check out their website There is a History Museum that you can check out as well with free admission
7857,5,This is a very beautiful building spanning multiple blocks in Seoul Its architecture is unique and outstanding from every perspective There are pianos in various locations free to play Around the back there is an upscale street clothing market
7858,5,The building is very attractive in design There are spaces for exchibitions in the building There are art shops and restaurants as well
7859,4,What an amazing building The little shops in DDP were really interesting and worth exploring Spend a lot of time in there Glad that interior is not overly clutter but kept clean and minimalistic The outside was full of activities so it was worth a trip both inside and out
7860,3,Was looking forward to coming here but after marvelling at the structure and sculptures outside we were a bit bemused by the inside We only managed to find a cafe and then a huge hall which was empty except for a couple of Mormon brothers having a rest Not sure what the point of the place is
7861,5,It is a wonderful place to visit Great architecture and atmosphere They have different exhibitions
7862,4,This is a fascinating building which looks great from pretty much any angle There didnt seem to be an awful lot to do there  a small shopping arcade  a gallery for exhibitions plus some historic remains in the grounds with a small museum  but we spent an hour or so there then went and ate in the arcades nearby then came back once it was dark when it looked even better It reflects the light from surrounding buildings  looks quite otherworldly Well worth a brief visit
7863,5,As an architecture buff I found this plaza in Seoul to feature one of the most innovative modern structures that I have seen I first visited the 7level 4 above ground and 3 below building during the day and was so impressed that I returned to introduce the center to my husband that night Designed by architect Zaha Hadid the futuristic construction exhibits no straight lines or right angles Instead it presents elongated curvy forms built with concrete and cloaked in 45000 aluminum panels  At night the centers lights seem to glow from within At certain exterior vantage points its shape and silvery hue give the impression of what I imagine a giant spaceship to look like The park next to the building further enhances the look It holds 25550 LED roses which light up 5 minutes after sunset and are absolutely stunning It was a magical experience to stroll here in the dark  Inside the curves continue in long corridors and connecting stairways there are also standard elevators The center serves as a fairly new venue for design in Seoul featuring an art hall meeting space a museum a design lab and a design market I visited the huge lab which displays a variety of wellcrafted items for sale and gives visitors the opportunity to meet the designers We enjoyed a light dinner in one of the many eateries in the market which is connected to the nearby Dongdaemun shopping centers  DDP located in Downtown Seoul is easily reached by subway Take Line 2 4 or 5 to Dongdaemun History and Culture Park Station and leave through exits 1 or 10
7864,5,We visited here as a nice walk in the evening dont miss this work of art on the beautiful architecture there are so many great things about this building obviously curvy outside is amazing The interior and exterior both are inspiring
7865,4,I loved the outside of this structure with its sinuous metal shape winding around gardens and walkways and couldnt wait to explore further It is beautiful and whatever is going on inside the building itself is worth a visit There were two exhibitions on when I visited which were both quite interesting but didnt really float my boat  but thats subjective they were very well presented and worth the time I spent there Take time to explore the building the nooks and crannies and little architectural surprises are a joy to discover
7866,4,Visited this place after recommended from local The design of the building is very unique especially in the night Do visit this place if in Seoul
7867,5,Glad to be a witness of Zaha Hadids work in Seoul all the curves and the details that house all the creative spaces in the complex such as museums galleries multipurpose halls markets and restaurants such eye candies
7868,4,Went here with my fiance and its amazing The structure of the building is impressive The way they left a piece of history in the middle is great and I love the 2 statues as well If you get hungry there are a few different places to eat Definitely going to go back next year
7869,4,Very nice to go even on a rainyday Seoul showing off their modern arquitecture you can take nice pictures and visit Kako friends shop without the crowd
7870,5,As walk out of the Dongdaemun metro station a huge metal clad curved building takes your breath away Its the Dongdaemun Heritage and Cultural Plaza designed by world famous architect Zaha Hadid the Queen of Curve 20072013 The building blends into the historic landscape of the old Seoul City Wall at the point where the river used to run under the wall there is the aptly named Water Gate  with a timber grill to bar entry The Plaza has sinuous paths to mirror the sinuous building Inside there is a museum and the Cafe de Fressina A visit to the cafe is a must  it is in a huge cavern with the flooring the furnishings and the stunning serving counter designed by Zaha Hadid Have a coffee and cake  snack Walk around a while and take back your breath See my photos
7871,5,This impressive modern building desgined by the prestigious architect Zaha Hadid is the hube of the huge square Theres is a design museum inside that you can visit Sorrounding the metal structure of the building you can visit the restored remains of the ancient fortress There is also a small but exquisit museum dedicated to the old stadium that was demolished to build the square that you can contemplate today The area is plenty of markets shops restaurants
7872,5,This is such a great area to visit Great architecture and lots to do here Shopping outdoor markets food buildings Their buildings are absolutely amazing
7873,5,This building is truly spectacular and definitely worth a visit There is a design museum and design exhibits to see There is also plenty of shopping and dining opportunities around the plaza
7874,5,We admire ZH jewels this is one with rounded forms Could spend hours there Actual exhibition Paul Smith fashion designer
7875,4,Not worth a visit on its own but really cool architecture and a photo op If there be sure to visit the free Stadium Museum next door commemorating the old sports complex build by the Japanese that was demolished to DDP
7876,5,Impressive art in the building It suit the city scenarios very well not disturbing at all Inside also it could be a surprise
7877,4,with a neofuturistic design Located in the center of South Koreas fashion hub  Multiple levels 5 halls The filming location of a couple of different dramas Opened for conferences exhibitions and various events There is park on the roof
7878,5,Such a beautiful place to take picture The building design are unique and beautiful You can enter the underground and enjoy your shopping
7879,4,Exhibitions are well set and have lots of works present Not to mention the building itself which is sick
7880,5,I love this area Its such a treat for my eyes every time I see DDP Such a beautiful architectural design that has to be seen in person as photos dont do it justice Also the shopping here is very good the business hours of the shopping centers is staggered so it offers shopping pretty much 24 hours I prefer this area over Myeongdong although its also crowded its more open with the shopping centers vs outdoor shopping streets
7881,4,Just walking around and experiencing the innovative space new views opening up was interesting The stores  museums Disney inside were of the boring mall variety
7882,5,Very Impressive with the architecture by the late zaha hadid Theres a cafe inside and some shops underground
7883,4,Beautiful place where to spend a night There are some kiosks for street food shops people all around and a pleasant atmosphere The Design of the entire area is just amazing
7884,5,This place simply has to be seen to be appreciated The design is on a large staggering scale and surprises when compared to the many tiny alleyways that are in surrounding neighbourhoods The fashion malls in the area are unbelievable in terms of number of shops selection and pricing
7885,5,Very beautiful lots of English signs and explanation Good for photography walking We got the opportunity to see Seoul metro station
7886,4,Seoul  a city of 24 hour fried chicken beer and shoju with ladies shopping non stop till 5 am in 89 Stories malls of shops including basement shopping  Important note to Seoul  Come with empty luggage as you dont need clothes masks or cosmetics  You can shop till you are broke Always bring cash in Won or   Tips for shopaholic  Remember you can always go back to hotel to shower and reconsider that dress and go back to the mall at 3 am to buy and then celebrate the great achievements of full luggage and extra luggage and then have a late supper of fried chicken with beer after  Most important Download Naver map as Google map dont work in Seoul 
7887,5,Loved the architecture and the shops inside the exhibition area Bought quite a few interesting things there like a bookmark inspired by the DDP architecture and rlly good leather card holder We did not plan to specifically visit this place but it turned out to be so pleasant
7888,3,My hotel was close to this unusual collection of buildings so we took time to explore including the design exhibition  I found the architecture a bit too brutalist but some will like it  The archaeological diggings in the centre of the buildings were interesting with bilingual signage  We found a Vietnamese restaurant chain outlet inside so inexpensively lunched at that  The below ground Metro station is one of Seouls busiest and quite a labyrinth but if confused just ask a younger local as many now speak English and are exceedingly helpful
7889,3,Cool place but nothing special other than the building itself Stores and restaurants inside is like any other typical shopping area A place to stopby while you shop and dongdaemun
7890,3,The building itself is wonderful but full of wasted space You walk around expecting something great but it never comes The shops around the area are a waste of time selling knockoffs and cheap local style ajima style clothing
7891,3,Interesting building but inside there was a huge hall with many unusual chairs which I suppose were interesting but not particularly inspiring The interior is worn and in need of renovation all in all it seemed like a bit of a white elephant
7892,5,Amazing architecture  the work of Zaha Hadid Interestingly arranged interiors  from the design galery to the shopping center Worth a visit
7893,5,Here you can easily spend lot of time impressive place also from outside and inside Loved furniture exhibition where you see and can try design chairs all over from the world
7894,4,Some interactive design fun with chairs and pianos This will either be a nice rest stop as there are tons of seating options inside and some lay down options outside or an enjoyable hangout spot if you enjoy design and art Possibly a great place to get high quality gifts
7895,5,The plaza architect is stunning and exotic Its really cool experience to walk through the buildings There are some cherry blossom at the back of the plaza early April
7896,5,I really like it here They had some pianos laying around so I got to play them I like the idea of entertaining fellow visitors   This doesnt have the LED rose since its an exhibition that ended a long time ago sad But we got to walk around and appreciate the buildings in the night  I know that they over some exhibition at the halls but for Gods sake this place is huge We just had like 30 minutes to go around the area so I really want to go back and visit this place again
7897,4,Cool building outside and in located in the centre of Dongdaemun with the large shopping plazas can come in to have a look around
7898,5,I really love the DDP  first of all its exterior design is so pleasing to my eyes Its curvy and fluid and just super cool In the evening when its lights go on it really looks like a spaceship out of Star Trek I enjoy walking around its many corners adoring them over and over again The inside is as cool as the outside With interesting exhibitions stores and the most interesting stairs this place is really worth checking out and especially if you are into design style architecture and space
7899,4,This building has a very cool architecture style and for those who love photography you can also have a photo hunting day here in DDP
7900,4,This place is good start for people who are still beginner in understanding minimalist art and urban landscape The unique thing about this museum in my opinion that it is the pioneer of art sharing which is seen globally in terms of minimalist and urban art
7901,5,A very stunning building Every corner of this building is a very good photo spot Also dont forget to take photos at I Seoul U sign while you are here
7902,4,This plaza stands out in Dongdaemun area with its large and unique design building It is used to host various exhibitions fashion shows conferences etc The building consists of the Art Hall Museum Design Laboratory Oullim Square and Dongdaemun History  Culture Park Just behind the plaza is a small and quiet park with many free seats with umbrella covers
7903,5,I wasnt actually able to explore the place due to lack of time but I happened to pass by and took a selfie I am awed by its spaceshiplike design I heard this is a shopping place for designer clothes and shoes so I think prices here are more expensive compared to those shopping streets like Myeongdong
7904,4,I like the design of the building  inside and outside There is coffee area as well Love the design
7905,4,this design plaza is a sleek soft metal building with surrounding galleries shops  restaurants which is all very interesting and fun for the entire family there is also the river close by below ground level to explore or picnic
7906,4,Dongdaemun Design Plazas curvy and wave structure catches my eye in a neighbourhood of straight boxy office buildings Without the signages you would not know where is the entrance to the building  We walked around the DPP on a late afternoon to appreciate its exterior Each different angle gives you a fresh perspective of the building  We didnt visit any of the indoor exhibitions There are shops cafe and restaurants in the basement and street artists who could do a quick portrait for you  The DDP is directly connected to a subway station Ill recommend a visit in the early evening
7907,4,One cant miss this delightful building when in the area  but the delightful exterior far exceeds the utilitarian interior
7908,4,If you are a designer or has likes to see various creative work then this is an area you should visit while in Seoul There are a lot of shops exhibits activities that you can visit and experience Coffee shops food shops etcare available as this is located on top of a subway train station Dongdaemum History  Culture Park
7909,5,Good place to visit chill and can be a nice place to explore Recommend for people who interest in any event or designs Flee market and food trucks available sometimes Nice and creative architecture Place to visit for designs and creative goods seeking Temporary events rotate periodically As time of my visit there are many interesting events such as Hello Paul Smith and The Art of Disney The Magic of Animation Flee market and food trucks in the evening as well More spaces to walk around and chill out Easy to access with many public transportations  Idea to visit if you have spare time
7910,4,If you happen to pass by this attraction go ahead and give it a visit You will be marvelled by the designstructure of this building It seems to be a convention area for special events The time we went there were several food and retail carts along the garden area The adjoining underpass had shops to check out Overall a good place to hang out and chill after a long day
7911,4,This building was full of curves and flowing lines that made it one of the coolest buildings we visited Inside an almost all white walkway spiraled up to the top floor making for a long walk along the outer circumference of DDP A staircase with an oddly angled and brown contrasting steps brought us back down  The building and surrounding areas were open 24 hours a day I walked around for free inside but to visit any of the exhibits or museums you just had to pay an admission fee roughly W16000 for adults On the ground floor was a temporary exhibit on Disney animation which seemed to be quite popular There also was a Disney store and lots of silkscreened animation scenes from the likes of Frozen Big Hero 6 and Moana On the second floor was an art museum On the third floor was a childrens play area some collaboration space and on the roof a viewing area and a cafe In the back was a lush landscaped area with seating a piano and various art pieces In the front was a large courtyard where lots of people were congregated  My daughter previously visited during the nighttime and enjoyed seeing the building lit up We will have to visit again
7912,5,The way its made its super unique and beautiful Situated in the biggest shopping district of Seoul This area is surrounded by malls Must visit to click some great pictures
7913,4,Dongdaemun Design Plazas architecture is amazinggreat sight with several shopping centers nearby
7914,4,Glad that we saw this ongoing Disney exhibition from 2019419 to 2019818 Really nice to relive the childhood memories and learnt more about how Disney actually evolves through the years Tickets are  15000 KRW for an adult  Theres another area with cafes and shops Else just take a seat outdoor and enjoy the breeze  We saw the LED rose at night too
7915,5,Dont miss a visit to the DDP if you want to get away from temples for a while and see an ultramodern side of Seoul Aside from the architecture the centre has other attractions and shops When I visited there was a Disney Animation exhibition Definitely worth seeing Oh and if you play the piano there are several dotted around the complex Just sit down and play
7916,5,The building designed by the wellknown late Zaha Hadid looks like a scifi spaceship landed in the middle of the city aurrounded by shopping malls It looks amazing and walking in it feels like inside something surreal Every corner is curved giving the feeling of endless boundary without borders Really very interesting design concept and realization
7917,3,I may have selected the wrong time to visit so take that into account First if you enjoy architecture the building itself is so unique and beautiful that you cant go wrong The building the artistic statues outside perhaps the correct term would be sculptures are definitely worth seeing in person The interior is peaceful and calm which contradicts what you might anticipate looking at the space age like exterior However there wasnt a lot going on inside during my particular visit If you have young kids they would have fun on I believe it was the third or possibly fourth floor
7918,5,Beautiful structure I was so amazed how it was done You have to see it for yourself One of the best place I have visited in South Korea Superb 
7919,4,I came shopping here around Dongdaemun area and came upon this beautiful design plaza It is a great picture opportunity and you can sit or drink and eat around here They have places for you to sit and just chill This plaza is just right behind the station It is convenient and nice to get to
7920,4,Nice place for photo shoot There are a lot of points for photo Sometime has show or exhibition there
7921,4,First time to visit DDP and was impressed with its design Its like an infinity elongated curve from start to end It would be nice if you could see the plaza in its total structure as it is quite unique and futuristic We were there late afternoon and when it got dark the lights gave the plaza an awsome ambience They have this attraction which we visited and waited for hours the socalled led rose garden where hundreds or thousands of roses automatically light up as the sun sets It was a nice view as the night went deeper There are also have art hall museum design lab design market culture and history park but most of them were closed when we were there Its quite tiring if you tour around the big plaza but there are coffee shops and restaurants where you can eat and rest Its good to visit this place
7922,3,I do love design so I was really looking forward to my visit to the Dongdaemun Design Plaza DDP Having dragged my family to it I must say I was  disappointed  Yes amidst Seouls skyline the DDPs facade is aesthetically unique for its fluid lines and steel curvatures There is no doubt its sheer outline exudes design  But once we appreciated the swooping facade and geometries there is just emptiness inside the building empty rooms empty echoey corridors and vast empty spaces For a designer space is a design element but when we went around 4 pm on April 17 there were no exhibits no permanent showcase not even food trucks Just one big EMPTY building  OK if you are a modern architecture design nut and enjoy photographing shapes but you might want to skip this if you have mixed group For a showcase design plaza they really could have done more with it
7923,5,Dongdaemon Design Plaza has a modern architecture Its about 19 mins walk from train station Its a must visit place
7924,4,Ideally for teenagers that love shopping as some of the shops operate till 3am late night and lots branded is on sales ;
7925,4,When we visited it was really cold but there were still so many people around There werent that many food stalls opened as we had hoped for but there was a piano there that we enjoyed playing
7926,4,Its good to see in the daylight but more spectacular at night with all the LED flowers all light up tooThere is a cafe insideLooks like a huge spaceship with its many windowslots of photo opportunitiesThe steps leading out of the area are also light up
7927,5,If you like architecture and are interested in design you definitely should take at least a walk around this spacious building You can also go to the design exhibition
7928,5,A huge design of greatness with glimpse of citys history and culture Went there to watch the rose lights but arrived before dark Amazed Bejeweled Enchanted Must see
7929,2,We arent only to find out there were no exhibits Literally zero things to look at inside Its a nice enough building but we were expecting to see actual design work inside only to discover they were between exhibits have no permanent collections and most people went for the market out front and the childrens playland on the top floor It was very disappointing Would highly recommend finding out if theres actually something to look at before you go else just stop by if its on your way to someplace else Not worth it to go to Dongdaemun just to look at an empty building
7930,5,Generally Seoul has not fine architecturel profile but this DDP is well aesthetic huge building I experienced and felt touching watching listening a functional sculpturea little bit in some where of the DDP I lost or confused about the horizon I advice at least two hours to spent in there
7931,4,We went in the evening There was a food and art fair when we were there A live musical performance as well Food trucks were available and the local youth were spending their evening enjoying the good food and music
7932,4,We stumbled upon DDP after exiting from the subway station It was very crowded at that time as it was Seoul Fashion Week There were many fashionable people dressed up and posing for photographers Very interesting to watch And of course the exterior design by renowned Zaha Hadid is something to look out for
7933,4,Spectacular 3D architecture design Impressive concept Worth a visit Beautiful from inside  outside for photos There was a change of new lease for the shops so we didnt get to see many shops on that day Shops were being refurbished
7934,4,Besides the great amazing architecture the thousands of LED rose flowers art exhibition also one of the most romance attraction at Design Plaza it will close on 300419 dont miss it at night time together with you lover so romantic for photo taking
7935,5,Fashion district and the design of the buildings were very modern and stateoftheart indeed There were also nearby malls and night market
7936,5,This is the worlds largest 3D atypical structure The architecture is amazing It has beautiful graceful curves The whole structure is column free At night time it is lit up and is really pretty
7937,4,The design plaza is so unique with futuristic exterior Inside it likes a maze Without direction information its hard to find the right way Somehow busy due to the fashion week
7938,4,I think this place is a worthwhile place to visit while in Seoul The building is nothing like Ive seen before Easy access via subway
7939,5,If youre into modern infrastructure engineering construction or art muesuem you must visit Dongdaemun Design Plaza This place is perfect for couples or families of all ages This destination is a futuristic multiuse facility that serves as a museum shopping center cafe holds public community events and is connected to the train system Its best to visit at night so you could view the beautiful artificial flowers that lightup The vibe here is very relaxing as people could be found everywhere socializing and being present in the moment
7940,4,I didnt go inside and suspect that it is even more impressive at night but it is impressive to be sure You can exit the subway station directly to it
7941,5,Wonderful park to spend an afternoon Lots of things to see and close to the famous fashion center Connected by metro and located near many restaurants
7942,5,Use Exit 10 to check out the front of DDP illuminated at night  Then walk a long its corridors and admire the changing lights of the structure
7943,5,The building alone is worth the time and then there is so much more going on  I took a couple of hours looking around  it is very organic form and I was really interested in the planting scheme as well Lovely that there were pianos dotted around for anyone to play when i was there and the very nice restaurants inside too
7944,5,Very nice place took a picture of it and check in to Facebook Alot of people as well so its nice Other than that nothing much
7945,5,The architectural design is very unique by following the contour of the surroundings  The thousand led flower lighting was mesmerising in the evening and is great for photography  In addition to near metro station there are nice shops and restaurants there as well
7946,5,Located in a Seoulstyle block dongdaemun design plaza is a extremely strange but spectacular construction Just like zaha always did she made DDP the an unusual construction and a representation of dongdaemun or even the whole Seoul  I always like zahas design and think it very cool to take photo here You can take very instergrammable photos inside or outside the building since the the Zaha style is everywhere here  If you hope to take some pure architecture photos I would recommend you to come the eighth floor of lotte FITIN which is a shopping mall facing to DDP There are lots of clean windows allowing you to take amazing photos of DDP at night In contrast there are some buildings nearby where you can not take satisfying photos for its dirty windows and terrible views
7947,5,This is a must see building in Dongdaemun It looks like a space ship at night with glistering lights all around The inside is white with curves and angles on the stairways that are pleasing to the eyes There was an art exhibition on the ground floor and interesting design items for sale when I was there in the beginining of Feburary There are two cafeterias that I can see on the top floor They even have a piano outside around the middle entrance under cover for passerbys to display their talents You can easily spend half a day there if you are into art and design
7948,2,We went DDP for photostop only I think we just need 1 hour to explore this place There are some foodtrucks in December 2018
7949,5,Located in Dondaemun and very close to our hotel this was a really interesting place to visit for all the family The building is truly stunning and the design resembles something from the future or like an extraterrestrial space ship You can wander around the outside underneath and inside and the different views of the building continually surprise  Inside there were many things happening There is a huge and fantastic play area for children an exhibition of Wallace  Grommit many shops and restaurants and cultural and art displays Even the stairways in the building are far from normal and cleverly designed  Probably the best time to visit is in the evening time and at night when the building comes to life with subtly placed lights so it even more resembles a flying saucer or space ship  During our visit in the evening time there were stands outdoors where people were selling handcrafted items such as jewellery singers and musicians performing and food trucks from the Seoul Bamdokkaebi Night Market offering all kinds of really delicious local and foreign snacks and street food
7950,5,I find the night view of this beautiful and serene amongst the hustle and bustle of the city Its a modern walk thru the garden where you will find lit roses and standalone pianos to be played by any passers by which can be heard from most parts of the spot In the day you can do more with the design labs art halls and others alike
7951,3,Mnet Music Awards 2018 was done here There are free entrance in some areas for exhibits and garden It is located near shopping malls and very convenient to go to because of nearby train station
7952,5,Nice lighting around the area The week that we went there they are having the mama awards but unfortunately we did not see any celebrity Overall the building is nice
7953,5,This museum is both stunning yet totally accessible in terms of bringing good design to all echelons of public and taste It is also situated in a fantastic area of shopping architecture and leisure Allow several hours to visit the area or stay in one of many nearby hotels
7954,4,I visited DDP at night Beautiful building and lights If youre here be sure not to miss the LED rose garden
7955,5,So glad I got to see this building Also Love the shop inside If you are an architect this is a must place to visit in Seoul
7956,4,Unusual and unique gifts all under one roof We bought baby socks a big hexagonal dish a foldable backpack a watch and Kpop paraphernalia We had fun checking out the wares that were on display  Tired and hungry Perkmeup treats are available at the AID cafe Scones sandwiches cake and coffees and teas They were excellent
7957,5,What are pleasant surprise so many lights were light up and the view is nice This building with super modern look
7958,4,the architecture is amazing best time to visit is evening so that you can see the lights  reflections over the huge building there are some exhibition halls inside the building an iconic land mark of Seoul highly recommended
7959,4,Beautiful building Attached with the subway that link to main station Nearby shopping area and restaurants Didnt get ti catch a show there because we didi not plan to But indeed it is a beautiful building to admire
7960,4,To be able to conceive such a beautiful building and making it a reality is awesome Must visit the LED Rose garden at Noght
7961,5,Went there with the intent to explore any design exhibitions In the end plans were mired by the architecture and Kakao store  The architecture was fascinating enough to capture even a laymans eyes At ever angle near the building it was stunning to see it especially closer to sunset Spent some time taking photos of the building Even more fascinating was how the building was not so obtrusive that it was rude to the environment It remained modestly unobtrusive retaining the harmony and yet feature its avantgarde intent  For families they can pop by the Kakao shop for photo opportunities with the cute figurines there Shopping is welcomed there too  The basement has FB outlets and shops The building is conveniently connected to the Dongdaemun History  Culture Park
7962,1,Its a beautiful building and you should visit if you are a champion of significant architecture If you love art you will be shattered with disappointment There is no art here  Changing exhibitions means that all galleries were closed Buildings designed to be galleries have been turned into job fairs malls and food courts Its pathetic that a civic project has been allowed to be so misaligned with the original intent
7963,5,The architecture is stunning but the usage of the space is a bit confusing seems to be more of an exhibition hall than a museum so if you want to see the interior find an event or you will be limited to the hallways and public spaces  That being said I strongly recommend a visit the entrance stairway alone is worth the visit in my opinion and the archaeological area at the base is very interesting
7964,3,Apart from the unique architecture there isnt much to do here Wouldnt recommend coming all the way for this
7965,5,This is a great place to shop for unique gifts and souvenirs We did the majority of our Christmas shopping here
7966,5,you must try this branch of Aori japanese ramen the soup broth is so thick and yummy the sliced pork doesnt smell and it was so soft it melted in my mouth the noodle was not soft or over cooked and it still had a good bite to it i ate here in 2 consecutive days you have to ask for their english menu
7967,4,We were not aware if there was any exhibit going on the time We came at night and did not explore much but it was already awesome
7968,1,Remember  on Monday they closed No one told me even this TripAdvisor that DDP is closed every Monday we took far away travel to DDP from Gangnamgu after myeongdong by train but when we are here is closed only design market is open lost our time
7969,5,Dongdaemun design plaza designed by Zaha Hadid is beautiful and futuristic with curvaceous forms There is artwork exhibited a cafe and much more I enjoyed walking around it and admiring the beatiful forms There are also other stores and restaurants in the surrounding area
7970,4,Its a pretty awesome looking building to go see Its also where all the shopping malls are so its worth it to go see and the light up white roses are just outside
7971,3,The design of the building is unique and theres spiral staircase within First floor showcases designer clothes bags Theres a design museum It is basically a place that shows designers stuff
7972,5,Its a must see appreciate the design of the building and come at night so you can see the different lighting fixtures Also dont forget to see the LED rose garden
7973,5,Unfortunately we missed this as it doesnt open until 1000 which is when we had to leave we were only in Soeul for 23 hours so did the night market and missed this as our hotel hadnt mentioned it was so near The building is stunning shame we didnt get the full experience check the opening timings if your going as it changes weedaysweekends
7974,4,Fantastic structure on the edge of the inner city of Seoul in the bustling markets of Dongdaemun Located on the site of the old baseball stadium the DDP represents a unique piece of building which looks like a huge sculpture in the classic curvy design of Zaha Hadid Carefully built using BIM modelling the building contains galleries shops and public areas inside and outside for just viewing and enjoying the atmosphere The building has lots of secretes and is worth a tour In December 2018 there will be a display of fine jewelry from the famous jewelry house of Switzerland Definitely worth a look 
7975,5,Dongdaemun Design Plaza is a well known architecture and unique structure in Seoul Better be here and be amaze
7976,5,We visited just after sunset around dusk The lights came on shortly after we arrived Fantastic building its great to be able to wander around  view it from all angles Really beautiful so glad we visited
7977,4,When around late afternoon you cannot miss that landmark Got a mix feeling about the place got shops and quite confusing for me The lights displaydesign has dimmed when I was there and not as impressive as initially thoughts but still acceptable view at night Use your imagination and photo app ;
7978,5,Visited this iconic architectural site on 26 October 2018 about 5 PM its the perfect time to take pictures only a couple hours before sunset we still have natural light shadow was softer the angles and length more vibrant The view was breathtaking
7979,5,DDP is a landmark that cant be missed in Dongdaemun Check the design shops and museum in the building for interesting design items There was a street play by a young group about plastic pollution and a Halloweenthemed food truck lane DDP is more beautiful at night
7980,5,ddp has an amazing architecture quiet interesting  Walking was quiet cool and we had a wonderful time  perfect weather when we went there last october
7981,3,Only visited during the day Some people say here that it looks great at night Im sure it would They pulled down a huge baseball complex to build this amazing shell of a building on this site Its great looking on the outside but its the opposite of the Tardis Big on the outside virtually nothing on the inside A couple of unattended sad sort of museums  with boxes etc just lying around  a small shopping centre and a train station entry Must have cost a bomb Nice curvy lines yes practical useful  not at all Underutilised An opportunity lost  a concert hall it should have been or just a modern stadium etc  and I love modern architecture but only if it is functional
7982,5,It is a rare opportunity to visit the Master Architect of the world Zaha Hadid Walk inside and outside and enjoy this rare piece of art Magnificent and FREE
7983,5,I didnt have any expectation going there but it smacked me right in the face I am glad we went there it fulfils its role as design centre there are museum halls marketplace for budding artists and also shoppingeating centre in one place making it a onestop destination for everyone you can definitely have great pictures in the buildings premise just find angles that you like favorite photo spot is the stairs
7984,5,We purposely went there to see the landscape and the building modern and we were like walking under a space ship hoping to meet some aliens there Dont miss the LED Rose garden Did not went for shopping there
7985,5,This beautiful curvilinear building and artwork is an oxymoron to historical and cultural park We only had time to walk the west side of the building and browse the arty design themed shops in the south part of the building There are interesting pieces to buy in these shops Its a worthwhile visit on its own or if some of your party prefers shopping for clothes at the malls across the street and you dont
7986,4,After seeing Koreas traditional houses Dondaemuns design plaza shows the other side of Korea The place is best viewed at night to see how the lights on the building facade highlights its modern designarchitecture
7987,5,This was very near my hotel and it was really impressive at night The building was lit up and looked very modern There was so much to do around the building Highly recommended
7988,5,Try visiting when they hold the evening markets The whole place is amazingly designed hence the name and some of the galleries and exhibits are definitely good Even the stairways are nicely designed not forgetting the lightings a good 1hr walk even when your aim was to shop at DDM
7989,5,The building is beautiful and an amazing work of art The walkways and overhanging beams make for great photos Theres many small boutiques inside that sell some of the most unique gifts and home decor Ive ever seen The top floor has a greenspace and restaurant Great area for just walking around
7990,5,Checked out Dongdaemun Design Plaza at night Cool to see it all lit up Close to a market Had someone playing the piano and a neat LED flower garden
7991,3,We visited the place at night to look at the Led garden It was beautiful It is quite easy to find the Led garden It was quite impressive
7992,5,This Zaha Hadiddesigned building is absolutely stunning both inside and out and is a must see if you are interested in architecture Photos dont do it justice as it is such a vast space from up close Inside there is a large exhibition space featuring young designers which is great for browsing for gifts Outside it is a short walk through the park to the shopping area of Dongdaemun
7993,5,Come over to experience one of the last great architectural masterpieces by Zaha Hadid It will not disappoint She quickly understood that Seoul is defined by its seven rings of mountains Resembling a blobby mountainscape you can walk on top of the complex and see the mountains yourself Come at about dusk The night illumination of this building is stunning Inside one of the wings has a great collection of design stores that is easy to walk through and enjoyable to browse The other wings have changing exhibitions and shows Incredibly easy to get to as it is connected to the subway Dont forget the world famous GwangJang Open Market featured on travel shows worldwide for the cheapest and best eats Take a stroll along the Cheonggye Cheon Canal to get away from the city
7994,5,We arrived just before sunset  had the chance to see the transformation of this piece of art with the day  night time An absolute gem in the Centre of Seoul Worth going to appreciate the beauty created by an amazing artist
7995,5,It was fun in there and the epic designs of structures are superb Definitely an instagramworthy place Spend the afternoon there while waiting for our flight back to our country and it was the right decision
7996,5,Visited the DDP at night and it was so beautiful The architectural beauty of Zaha Hadids design is accentuated at night with lights to wonderful effect Didnt enter the building rather enjoyed the building and sculptures from outside Definitely worth a look
7997,5,Beautiful Hard to find the entrance Great outdoor space as well The area has shopping and food Make sure to look for the rose garden
7998,4,Great locationand everything looks new suitable for girls stay Easy going to all major points with metro or taxi and many good food choices around Definitely will choose it again
7999,4,We were lucky that this beautiful piece of architecture was located almost next to our hotel This place is really amazing Walked around for one hour and took pictures from every direction The forms are just amazing It also stores a museum and some shops Opposite the famous shopping buildings Lotte and APM wholesale
8000,3,I think most people come here to see the unique architecture But if you like art go inside Many shops there sell novelties and artsy things
8001,5,its better to visit DDP at sunset so you can enjoy a breathtaking view from the building and enjoy the vibrant walking areas
8002,4,This building is definitely oneofakind in Seoul with its neofuturistic design and massive perimeter kind of looks like a UFO IMO Best visited at night when all of its lights are switched on Tip For foodies like myself there is an awesome food court at Doota Mall opposite DDP Basement 1 Worth a visit
8003,5,Sculptures were fascinating and architecture amazing definitely worth a walk around and spend some time relaxing with a coffee
8004,4,The Design Plaza is an interesting building and if you are in the neigbourhood you should drop by Wheter its worth a major detour depend on whats on display
8005,3,It is better to view this from a distance so you can appreciate the whole architecture But once inside there is not much to do
8006,5,It is a very interesting building especially for someone who loves to take architecture pictures  There is a small russian district nearby
8007,4,Im not much into artworks but my sister really wanted to go so we headed over From the outside it is stunning with a couple of lovely statues and inside is pretty cool too  though not as much to see as I thought there would be A few of the areas were pretty enjoyable to look at and I enjoyed the design plaza with all the different shops  lots of cute little items for sale
8008,4,The building itself is greatespecially if you like architecture photography The shops downstairs are nothing special but as its close to Dongdeamun Market its certainly worth a look around
8009,5,While staying in Dongdaedum visited DDP many times Loved the Farmers Market the LED flowers at nightand the design shops full of interesting and innovative products Such an interesting building and the space around it
8010,4,During my short trip to Seoul I tried to walk around the city as much as I could and found that stumbling upon the DDP around night was one of the highlights of my time there Its absolutely stunning theres ample space to just sit and relax chat with friends or take in the sights Lots of stores as well including a LINE Friends one that was super interesting to check out and do some souvenir shopping at Not sure it this would still be here but there were also lots of popup pianos that you were welcome to use and created a really awesome atmosphere Nearby electronic rose garden was also absolutely stunning Overall even if you cant stay long definitely try to stop by the DDP during your time in Seoul
8011,4,Omg this place you can shop and shop till you drop many many kinds of fashion outlets and all the newest fashion are found here
8012,5,a new place to hangout and very stylish even at night People are very relaxed and theres night markets every Friday and Saturday Though not many foods for selection you wont regret visiting
8013,5,We visited the Dongdaemun Design Plaza late in the afternoon after a day of sightseeing as I was interested in seeing the ZahaHadid designed building in real life  The building itself is breathtakingly beautiful and equally impressive in my opinion and worth the trip alone What makes it even better is that there is a very large kids play area on the top floor that provided hours of airconditioned fun for our kids on a very hot day In a busy city like Seoul that does not have a tremendous amount of activities for kids note we live in Sydney Australia so were very spoilt for choice this can be an absolute life saver and I dont understand why the play area is not advertised more  If I were to make a top 3 of things to visit in Seoul the DDP would definitely be in it
8014,4,Very impressive architecture Saw the led roses lit up at night Beautiful There were stalls selling handmade accessories and essential oils There were also carts selling food and drinks at night Prices are quite high tho
8015,5,The architecture is beautiful and very futuristic looking There are a bunch of shops inside The second time I came here in 2015 I think there was some type of event going on outside with a stage set up and some music artists were performing It was no one I recognized and I think they were rehearsing for something later in the day or evening It definitely seemed like things were still being set up The subway stops right at the DDP so its convenient to get to via subway You could spend so much time just taking photos outside before even going inside to explore Its also close to Doota and other shopping areas right across the street so expect to spend a few hours in this area if you want to go shopping
8016,4,We went there primarily to shop nearby and took a coffee break inside one of the cafes The structure is really impressive for the architecture and good for photos It is also a subway stop so its handy to exit here and look around this shopping neighborhood
8017,4,Love how this place offer bazzars and some events They have some good places to go My favorite is kakao store
8018,5,enjoyed the design and if you go in the evening it is decorated with colorful light found not much to do
8019,4,This is a huge place full of interesting architectural designs There are some shops indoors; another museum cool eatingcafe area inside Lots of great spots for pics My daughter was there a couple of months ago during Fashion week  said you could see all kinds of ordinary people dressed wild over the top  cool during that time around there  Our favorite part was relaxing outdoors on the big blue lounge beds You must take your shoes off  then just lay down relax  enjoy the shaded breeze
8020,4,As many are aware of the design is the work of the famous Zaha Hadid Looking very cool with futuristic curvy edges But the inside is not impressive There were just a few events and shops It felt like a newly built office building There are some things to have fun though I found a free piano to play near the entrance in the middle
8021,5,Actually I didnt take many events there When I was there there were some special exhibition or shows but I didnt have enough time so I cant enjoy them But I looked around design shops and design museum there and it was great experience
8022,4,There are so many amazing buildings in Seoul to see mostly historical palaces but theres something new and very impressive to see Dongdaemun Design Plaza DDP it is rather futuristic  The DDP is divided into a Design Hall Art Hall and Museum Hall the whole complex is free to the public to visit we walked through one of the buildings but got more joy out of walking around outside  The complex was built on the former sight of Dongdaemun Stadium built by the Japanese in the 1920s during the Japanese occupation During the process of redevelopment of the sight relics were found which are now displayed on a large surface under the canopy of the curved roofline There are many other interesting things to see do and eat in the area its a great part of Seoul to explore
8023,3,Its definitely worth seeing and walking around the exterior of this building but it wasnt worth paying 10000 Won to visit the museum inside There wasnt much in the museum and it featured some drawings paintings and hanboks There was a gift shop in the museum
8024,5,What a fantastic idea So much creativity to see and on the day we went there was an African food market Typical Seoul to always be thought provoking and creative Great coffee shop inside if you need to shelter from the heat or cold too
8025,5,Visited the Van Cleef  Arpels exhibit Worth the visit  Very nice outdoor fashion show also Nice music 
8026,4,This is the place where Seoul Fashion Week is conducted and it sits near the famous Dongdaemun Shopping Area The building is contemporarily artsy and most people come here to take pictures on the photogenic spots
8027,5,I went to the DPP for the first time a few years ago checking out its architecture and the galleries inside Its a must visit for anyone who visits Seoul in particular if you are interested in architecture and design Great photo ops both day and night When I went this time for the exhibition on The Art of Aardman Animations Wallace and Gromit  Friends it was pouring Glad that I already had a detailed look on my last visit Despite the heavy rain a trip there to see the exhibition was very worthwhile The exhibition has already gone to Germany and Australia and is in Seoul now Lucky I could catch it here I am a huge fan of Aardman animations and had a great time viewing the sketches videos original sets with all the details If you go note that photo are not allowed except at 4 spots
8028,4,Besides the beautiful architecture of the DDP we have not visited the galleries the highlight is the LED rose garden which looked so beautiful at night A must visit when in Seoul
8029,5,Very artistic and very big but very interesting Lots of things happening inside even if you didnt want to do anything its just nice to be there and enjoy the scenery Lots of shopping opportunities Love Seoul
8030,3,The only cool thing about this place is the design of the plaza and the rose led garden so go at night to see it lit up Shopping is the same as everywhere else I like Namdaemun market more than Gwangjang market because the street food is better Im not a big souvenir shopper so once you see 1 market theyre pretty much the same except for the food variety If youre tight on time you can stay in this area and skip Myeongdong and Namdaemun Theyre pretty much the same but this area is cleaner and more modern If street food is more important to you and youre shopping for eyeglasses Myeongdong and Namdaemun have more street food variety and eyeglasses selections
8031,3,went to dongdaemun and pass by the DDP for a look around wonderful architecture but thats just it nothing special inside
8032,2,The design of the complex is great but that is all about it Many empty stores and spaces Better to be seen than visited
8033,5,No doubt DDP is one of the most interesting sites to see in Seoul Designed by famed Iranian architect Zaha Hadid DDP is a fascinating contradiction to the squarish city that is Seoul To really appreciate the marvel visitors need to spend at least half a day walking and discover all its nooks and crannies
8034,5,As great it is to walk around you should really go in and check their design stores with some tasty coffee
8035,4,The name of the place speak for it Its a very decent plaza to hangout for awhile all specially created gifts toys travel item etc One of the booth attract me its the 3D printing you take pictures surrounded by lotsa camera from 4 direction and the owner can print your photo into 3D form But a little costly for me 25CM size cost you 550000 won
8036,5,Nice building and design Walking distance to dongdaemun shopping district There is a museum too Visit if you enjoy design and arts
8037,5,This is my first encounter with zaha hadids architecture and can finally understand her talents Every architect who is aspiring to be great should come here to study her work Architectural documentation does no credit to her
8038,3,Happy Ive seen it architecture alone is breathtaking But nothing else Its just a fancy mall Come if you want to drop your kids to a playground come for food trucks and coffee shops come for cheap memorabilia shopping You wont find here anything you may not find elsewhere in Seouls markets Set your expectations straight youll have a great time Come for design art modernism youll leave craving for more
8039,4,Beautiful building designed by Zaha Hadid Even though nothing of interest went on inside or around the building for me it is worth an hour just to look around the building
8040,5,I was amazed by this building seeing all the curves I am an engineer so i appreciate from its exterior alone I wonder how they have drawn this There were nice buildings also within the vicinity so i guess visiting this place is worth it from the shopping plazas around here There is alao an ancient Seoul city wall under and a LED rose garden which is better seen at night
8041,5,Easily accessible by Dongdaemun History and Culture Metro station Big and beautiful building rather unique and artistic design A great place to walk and take a stroll at in the evening if you are coming to Dongdaemun lots of shopping and eateries opposite it
8042,5,The design of the building is fabulous At night it looks amazing It shows Seouls modernity I recommend to visit it
8043,5,This place is a must to see The architectuur can you campare with the modern part of Valencia or the Gugenheim building in Bilbao In the building you will be surprises buy the rolling lines of the walls
8044,5,This is a very artsy place where designers or architects would love it Even so do come and take a quick visit before heading over to Dongdaemun for your shopping  There are many exhibits which are quite interesting to see and you can chill at the rooftop grass field
8045,5,The design plaza is interesting to visit with many modern sculptures and exhibits I went to the Aardman exhibit displaying many canimated creations such as Shawn the Sheep and Walace and Gromit They explain the many different aspects that make clay figures into a movie the final product The exhibit provides you with original set pieces drawings and characters previously used After you finish at the exhibit there is a picture taking area where you can pose with you favorite characters of the Aardman studios The building is interesting modern and unique Would definitely recommend
8046,4,What I love It s the design The Main building is so stylish There is a nice garden around with lot of pleasant sitting area All around you ll find department store that open all night long Enjoy
8047,5,I only spent a while here because of time restriction but if you wait until evening the food truck will be open for business and the surrounding will be lit Inside there are lots of exhibits and art market On the top floor they have a beautiful roof top garden and some restaurants Definitely an artsy place I would recommend if you love art and design
8048,5,It is amazing area for shopping especially at night there is beautiful designs of clothes with good prices
8049,3,A very artistic and modern plaza where local youngsters love to hang around There are special labs for art students seminar rooms auditorium and a library On certain days there performance for budding young people to show cast their talents singing dancing as well as flea markets selling their handicrafts from jewelries to caricature It is situated right opposite the Dongdaemun shopping district If you happen to be in the area do take a stroll in the plaza to have the feel of arts
8050,5,The place itself its amazing and the expositions inside are changing constantly and very interesting We were there for the Fashion week and the location fitting amazingly with the event One of my favorite places of the area The surroundings have a lot of cool places to visit too
8051,4,It is a nice building surrounded by malls and restaurants Good for photo taking but the place itself has nothing much Perhaps spend an hour or less there take some photos and move to the shopping malls nearby or find a nice cafe to relax There is a tour bus station hopon hopoff nearby and a metro station right beside
8052,4,I cant forget the view that welcomed me to this mall so many LED roses bulbs all aglow Good thing we went there at night Plus weather right now is good spring season not too cold and not too hot Plus I was so ecstatic when I saw the area where my favorite Kpop group performed a dance Highlight boy band last year  woohoo
8053,5,At first glance the DDP looks like a set from a scifi movie more like a giant space ship The building has a very modern and futuristic design so it makes a very nice background for photos Dont forget to go to the back for the LED roses which light up at night There are not too many shops inside the building though But there are a lot of stores surrounding the DDP where you can do your shopping Worth the visit
8054,5,Upon arriving at the DDP  as soon as I stepped inside I can instantly tell the design was by the famous Zaha Hadid He buildings are huge and have very unique designs It is definitely a place for those who love art and architecture or even photography as the building offers a lot of amazing angles to shoot from The exterior of the building contains a section that has a lot of glass flowers that light up at night This building is useful during the day for daytime interior visits and also glamours at night time when the flowers light up 
8055,5,Only stopped here because the building looked so cool from outside my husband and I were on a bus tour Didnt go inside but walking around the building is cool enough; cool vibe and great people lots of food stands around and great architecture would highly recommend
8056,3,The only unique experience here is the building features and the way the path is design Building is quite big and there is a mini flea market going on the day I was visiting Thus there are some local product on sales where they promote their products
8057,3,The only nice thing I saw around this place is the colorful piano The white roses looks dirty already and even their lights are getting dimmer Hope they clean or fix them tho They look better when brighter You can spend a hour or two here and thats it unless theres an event or something
8058,5,In awe of the architectural structure its designed by Late Starchitect Zaha Hadid Its a must visit mostly for the architecture Their Archive cafe is also very nice with really good breads and hot chocolate
8059,4,Interesting art pieces around the plaza Inside is a museum with special exhibits at times Right outside is the Seoul City Tour double decker bus which you can buy a ticket for to enjoy sites around the area
8060,2,This is exotic and nice building for sure Made several shots of it But inside I was expecting something unusual inside as well however theres only food and shops Sometimes exhibitions
8061,4,In this plaza there is a exhibition hall and fortunately I went there when Pixar had a big event on their 30th anniversary I had a great time with my kids watched all the history of Pixar and got more knowledge of how did they made animation movies such like Toy Story UP etc
8062,3,Impressive place in terms of design but lacks an information counter or signages in English Good to walk around if you have no agenda
8063,5,The Dongdaemun Design Plaza was amazing i came here in the night and the lights make it more magical to see Since the mall around here they open 24 hours so this area will be packed by tourist and local who shop
8064,5,If you are ever in Seoul and want to enjoy modern architecture the Dongdaemun Design Plaza is a MUST
8065,5,This amazing building has to be seen to be appreciated Go to the top floor and out to see the green roof walk up and down the stairs explore the inside There are many small shops selling design goods and souveniers and cafes as well
8066,4,Not really a big attraction but it does have dining options and a interesting area for photos at night The LED rose garden is worth seeing at night without it being too crowded It is tucked away in the back of the building with stone walls surrounding making for architecturally intriguing photos When Seoul Fashion Week is held here it is great place for people watching
8067,4,Their operating hour is TuesdaySunday from 10AM to 7PM with extended hours of up to 9PM during Wednesdays and Fridays This landmark is very accessible since it is connected to Seoul Subway through Dongdaemun History  Culture Park Station There are also a lot of shopping malls and duty free shops around the area including stalls that appeared to turn into a street market at night
8068,5,A beautifully constructed building great place to go at night  take pictures Coffee shops inside
8069,5,A must see in Seoul especially at night Very impressive architecture by late Zaha Hadid she was an IraqiBritish architect Looks like an UFO has landed Has a lot of interesting design shops inside
8070,5,Its an amazing center of design and market The architecture looks like a spacecraft and inside you find many shops and restaurants Dont miss it
8071,4,We walked through a big modern coffee shop gate A3 inside the DDP and out into the led rose light garden which was outdoor During night time it was brilliant the glowing rose flower lights shine bright and lovely filled the gardens in DDP 
8072,5,I can say we were lucky because in our everyday itinerary we need to pass by in Dongdaemun Design Plaza The modern amazing architecture is simply picture perfect We had the opportunity to view this beautiful architectural work both day and night This is near Dongdaemun shopping districtmarket It is worth your time to visit if you happen to be in Seoul
8073,5,If you are into modern design and architecture this is the place to visit Designed by the late Zaha Hadid marvelous building
8074,4,Showcases modern architecture of curves and modern materials There are art shops inside that features unique designs There is a pay museum at upper level You can also relax at gardenopen areass around the building Right across the streets are several shopping malls some at duty free prices
8075,5,Theres a rose lampions  near the gate and people definetly came here to take a picture with that it was so beautiful tho Inside the Plaza we can buy souvenirs the place was so huuugee and incredible theres also a lot of restaurants and stores nearby
8076,4,I enjoyed seeing and being there it was something unusual but interesting and modern there were many traditional restaurants nearby
8077,5,Modern space Good shops and restaurants inside I tried Aori ramen They have cubicles for the introverts I just didnt have much fun because there are a couple of couples on my left and right who wouldnt stop chatting The division didnt stop them But the food was delicious I will be back this springtime Yay
8078,5,Very modern and impressively designed and on a subway station and near the Dongdaemun fashion towers and department stores Modern crafts to buy A welcome addition to the tourist trail in central Seoul
8079,4,The out side is in aluminium panels The interior has wood staircases with a very interestin design Is different exhibitions Souvenir shoprest area Subway lines 2 4 or 5 can get ypu there
8080,5,Chanced upon this place while visiting a local market Very impressive structure that is worth a visit in its own right
8081,5,its a must visit building in South Korea a masterpiece by zaha Hadid building without edgesall about the curves from outside to inside It has beautiful large park on the site and also roof garden completed with many function in one building shoppes museum etc its an honour for me to be there
8082,3,Definitely an area that appeals to people who like shopping Lots of shops and bargains to be had Metro nearby
8083,4,Looks wonderful on the outside Good for pics The shape is artsy and interesting We didnt do much inside other than wander around
8084,5,A must see when in Seoul For photographers of all levels this massive and unique design looks spectacular at night During the day it is a wonderful place to find younger locals who are always willing to practice their English with youand of course a selfie or two
8085,4,There are many little shops in this Plaza but the most interesting is the building itself Inside and out is it a marvel
8086,4,I was there in the night Not really sure what to see except the fake roses field The roses are so beautiful in the dark
8087,4,We went here on Sunday night to enjoy LED Rose Garden We came from exit 1 of Dongdaemun History and Culture Park station The building was so awesome There was a skating rink there Besides of rose garden there was some exhibitions inside the building Some of the exhibitions were free
8088,4,The place looks surreal but I enjoyed visiting it especially since we went there at night The building is a sight to see definitely but nothing much to do there There is some shopping inside but the malls across the street from the DDP are more interesting We looked for the touted thousand lighted roses but they were a dud They looked like their lights were on their last blink and they were not worth braving the very cold temp for One visit is enough for me
8089,5,Shop till you drop or take a walk with art it its futuristic form Even when it is closed it will still make you awe with their thousands and thousands LED ROSES at the back and the night spot lights emphasize the sexy contour of the building
8090,4,This is a cool spot in downtown Seoul I enjoyed walking around and through the rather large plaza and building designed by a probably pretentious architect with an idea of modernism Still there are plenty of shopping options and overpriced cafes 
8091,5,Marvel through the architecture wonder by Zaha Hadid We enjoyed browsing through the designers item on sale at the time of our visit The building is pretty at night
8092,5,The exterior of the building is absolutely striking and the interior is just as fascinating The current exhibition looks neat but it seemed a bit pricey and small It is an interesting place to visit if you like taking pictures and its a place that you are going to like it or hate it
8093,4,eye openers for new idea and design great place to visit if have time from major sight seeing places in Seoul
8094,2,Soooooo boring Dont know Some people like the building but inside nothing interesting Only few expencive shops Was glad to see a good shopping center nearby so it made the way there not so useless 
8095,4,Just the building and the surrounding area alone are worth a visit There werent many exhibitions going on when we were there though so the design shop was actually the most interesting thing inside with so much cute anime or kpop inspired things or design pieces
8096,5,This huge unusual building has no corners or straight walls Walk around it and enjoy the interesting surface of the building You will also pass the old city wall If you are smart you take an elevator of a the highest highrise building next to the DDP Once you have reacherd the top floor cross the roof by foot and from the staircase of the connecting building you have a perfect view on DDP and the old City wall
8097,5,We came to see the rose led installation but since it wasnt dark yet they werent lit The building is pretty cool architecturally and we enjoyed walking around the complex There was a lot of walking space free from vehicular traffic Also we walked inside a couple of the buildings Entrance is free
8098,5,If you love beautifully designed contemporary buildings then its worth checking out DDP We visited while there was a fashion show and there was a lot going on but theres also some shops and some art museums and stuff I believe theres kpop groups performing here from time to time as part of 1theks Run To You project so you might even be lucky to catch a performance
8099,5,Nice disigned structure and cultural space there is 2 times of fashion week a year nearby Dongdaemoon market easy to access with metro
8100,5,A great place to see modern buildings with unique designs There are shopping malls  art museums to visit Very nice view and a picture perfect place if you are in Seoul Not to miss this place You can also catch the Seoul Bus Tour here
8101,5,Incredible this construction The Building is amazing and the gardens are very well organize Dongdaemun has lots of things to do museum temporary expositions and shows
8102,5,Located next to the Dongdaemun History and Culture Park subway station DDP looks amazing in its design I wasnt into architecture as much but it was a great to see something this unique In addition to the exterior there were exhibitions inside that showcase some intriguing and quirky everyday products from local designers that can be bought DDP is surrounded by multiple shops in the Dongdaemun area so it can be a little side trip from shopping
8103,4,This place should be best to visit at night when the lights come on An impressive building by day the structure and its surrounds really comes alive when the sun sets and the various angles get enhanced by the external lights
8104,5,Although there are still some minor works going on in the interior and exterior this is an extremely avantgardistic and impressive project  at the site of a former stadium Dont miss the selfguided audio tour 4000 Won with good background information on 16 stops outside and inside the complex Also some design oriented shopping opportunities on site
8105,5,This is an astounding building inside and out totally dedicated to cutting edge design in its many forms Different studios office space conference areas some shops and  We went on Monday Most of the shops are closed then But we loved seeing the building from the inside and exploring the area around it If contemporary design does not interest you just drive by
8106,5,This is a great piece of art by a world famous architect who had left us with many of her designs in other parts of the world Also the Seoul government committed a big piece of land in the city for such project clap clap clap Inside the building is many shops for design items that I have not all visited Will plan to go again the next day
8107,4,Newest landmark connected to the subway and history and culture park station There are some building artitechure statues There is a park way Near by are shopping malls street market and seoul city wall and museum
8108,5,Dongdaemoon Design Plaza is very famous for its unique design  interesting displays This monument is located very close to variety of shopping areas including Dongdaemoon Market and Doota Shopping Tower
8109,4,Nice place to visit The architecture of the building is unique and interesting Also a lot of stalls selling artsy and unique things from bags to cellphone accessories Lots of places to seat outside as well
8110,5,Very beautiful building very strategic place There are so many shopping centers around the building The night view is amazing there are so many shop inside the building but the price is rather high compare to other store This place is accessible though the metro A must see place in Seoul If you going for a shopping I recommend you to visit Doota just next to the building The gift shop there are cheap
8111,4,Subway can reach Very convenience You can shoot some nice photos there Other than that nothing much inside It sell alot designer product
8112,4,Worth a train ride just to see its enormous structure Theres some shopping stalls inside but a expensive
8113,4,Love the designs by zaha hadid architects so went to visit DDP in Seoul Night view is just amazing must see there are some shops inside and also museums
8114,5,World famous architect designed building A wonderful costume display when we visited interesting retail outletsreasonably priced clothes amongst the boutique shops
8115,5,Youll probably bypass this location Youre loss So many free items to enjoy There are different types of things to experience
8116,5,designed by zaha hadid many exhibitions are open here also there are many designed shop in DDP
8117,5,I couldnt help but think of the Sydney Opera House and the Sagrada Familia when I walked around this structure and marvel at the what we can do today with the help of modern engineering and technology
8118,4,It is a very popular place but it is more saying that it rally is Has some cool places but not enough for a big place Ill doble think if I go there again
8119,5,As a student of architecture and I especially liked the unique architecture of this work It was created by Zaha Hadid a great architect  I really admire Architectural exterior as well as inner space is extremely great Inside the building is a shopping area with art shop  and an art exhibition place Behind have a rose garden are combined with light creating a space like heaven 
8120,5,I went to this exhibit which is mainly housed at the DDP and was wowed First the architecture of the building itself is really very unique with its undulating curves and color Very futuristic and stylish Then the main attraction was the exhibit which was incredible It was very obvious that a lot of work went into perfecting it and I really appreciated it It was so full of information that one visit would not be enough to soak in all the knowledge We had a tour guide and that worked out really well because she saved us from having to read and glean all the information ourselves She highlighted everything for us and answered all our questions Even that took some time The tour may be enough for some people but those who really want to delve into the exhibit can return and use the tour guide as a roadmap for tackling everything The other part of the exhibit was located in Donuimun Museum Village and we went there as well They really complemented each other very well Well worth a day trip and a return visit time allowing
8121,2,The building and the history points on site are nice but otherwise its just shops on the inside  My girlfriend said it was one of the top ten things to see in Seoul but I reckon you could safely miss this one
8122,4,We went to this shop twice as it had so many interesting items made by students in the design school Most were a little pricey but good to see the creativity that went into the final products
8123,2,Other than the brilliant architectural design of the premises there is nothing inside No exhibition and just some stores only
8124,5,one of the mustsee places in Asia Id say It is very futuristic zaha hadid made an incredible design The shops downstairs offer designer gadgets clothing home accessories toys etc It is an incredible place and the coffee shop is nice I suggest getting a mango beverage
8125,5,This is a wonderful modern complex that is stunning to view just from the outside Inside are many galleries and exhibitions and the interior design is equally as impressive as the exterior Some of the exhibits do charge but the complex as a whole is free
8126,4,As a fashion shopping area for young people I would recommend it as a place for tourists that there is no design for older women if there is in the sightseeing and trendy designs everyday
8127,4,The Design centre has several exhibition floors where you can find both local and overseas designers with their innovative art products Some are of artistic value while others are product of daily use Some special exhibitions are free of charge on Eednesday The souvenir shop on ground floor features a lot of innovative gadgets Worth a half day visit
8128,5,Even if you arent interested in the exhibition inside visit at night and walk around the complex The lighting reveals how magical this architecture is It will surely steal a lot of photo taking moments  When you visit inside during the daytime you will even more amazed how marvellous this architecture is You will be like strolling along exhibits on the walkway rather than in exhibition rooms Without knowing you will already be on the top floor or bottom floor There are lifts inside but if your physique allows try walking
8129,5,The building here so artsy and futuristic Be prepared to amazed since its not something u always get to see and there are also garden of led roses that shines in night Best to visit day and night
8130,4,The plaza is big and the design is unique It has shops and eateries and a nice place to hang around It is also near to the night market A very lively place indeed
8131,4,Awe Inspiring architecture lots of exhibitions design and concept stores Great picture opportunity
8132,5,Was floored by this building Great for photo opportunities Very unique style Lots of querky gift shops inside too which are good for souvenirs  Located right by metro exit Make sure you spend some good time here to look around Lots to see
8133,2,I guess check it out if youre in the Dongdaemun area for shopping Nothing to do here besides get overpriced coffee and take photos
8134,5,I really love this place The building is huge the complex is interesting i like the minimalistic inside and the design The hole plaza is nice I was there for the Biennale of architecture n urbanism  sad fact though is that there is a market area in the inside where unfortunately random shops are located
8135,3,My fav building in seoul Beautiful landscapes and architecture designs in n out Worth a visit while u r here
8136,4,we had a stroll at night the buildings architectural design is cool and pretty There were some shops inside and lots of open areas to hang out
8137,2,This is an attention grabbing building with little utility There is little going on inside Some shops selling modern design wares venders cafe Nothing substantial The Dongdarmun Market bldgs are still there with its shops crammed with products
8138,5,t must go there A magnificient design Like a museum but its more than that Should visit on Saturdays night They have a garden of neon roses So great
8139,2,While the building on the outside was pretty cool there was little happening with the actually space There was no reason to even go inside it  a quick walk around on the outside is all its worth
8140,4,If you do not know where to spend your night in Seoul this place is not bad It is windy at night There was a public piano put at the street anyone can play My girl who likes to show off enjoyed it so much _
8141,5,We came here to have a stroll at night and this place was simply beautiful There were loads of food trucks if you want to have some street food The LED roses also made the place even more beautiful Good for a night stroll and some picture taking at night
8142,5,its an architectural master piece in my eyes Never seen something like this anywhere I love the night market and truck food LED rose lights at night makes it charming enough Head to Dongdaemun history and cultural park station for direct access  Dongdaemun station is next station and you might need to walk back to reach there  Outside of DDP there are lots of shop and the famous Migilore and Doosan shops Eat n shop
8143,3,The Dongdaemun design plaza is a beautiful structure You can find here a few big fashion musea with a few big event halls although I never had the luck to visit anyone of them Everytime I visit the place about every couple of months there are no events The design plaza is a good place to relax in a quiet place away from the buzz outside in the many fashion shopping malls right beside
8144,4,You dont see this type of building in your day to day life A moden marvel of architecture A place where people who love archetecture can enjoy my kids were not interested though
8145,5,this place is very big and so many tourist its not even a problem here maybe because its near to shopping mall and food truck outside we bought some souvenir at the road down there and the street food look really tempting yall really should try that
8146,5,What started as an attempt to see the flowery lights that we only see in kdramas  I was surprised to find that on the Saturday night that there will be loads of food trucks lines up in the vicinity of the DDP Boy the choices was good looking the portion of some of the order it was also quite filling and not to forget smells soo delicious We just had dinner  therefor was too full  But we did share a churros  which was awesome Crunchy on the outside with a soft chew fluffy insides   Besides foodtrucks there were selfmade artist selling their arts and also a blowup balloon arts that was everywhere  a very good night out and loads of photo Opps Do checkout this is on the weekend The night life from cheonggyecheon river to the malls opposite the DDP seems like its always busy with something during Saturday late evening to night   TIPS for those who doesnt have much time to spare in korea these places are all within walking distance to checkout  Cheonggyecheon River end  Grill Fish street  Dongdaemun Shopping Malls Multiple BIngsu places multiple Train stations nearby  if you come in the morning even have a historical landmark tooforgotten the name sorry but the DDP is quite central easy to make it a landmark InCaseOfLost among a big group  ENjoy
8147,4,Dongdaemun is a pretty interesting place with its countless street markets and architectural design but its nothing really more than a few photo ops here or there I do visit Dongdaemun frequently to clear the head after a heavy night out but there really isnt anything you would write home about If you are into photography it is a fantastic place to practice your depth of fields and length snapping but its nothing compared to the palaces you have on offer a mear 3 or 4 stops away in Jonggak or City hall I suggest visiting only if you have bags of time and you are passing Dongdaemun on the subway
8148,4,If you are into Architecture you must visit Dongdaemun Design Plaza I went here with great expectations and totally amazed with the building  although I am not a fans of zaha hadid style of Architecture The building itself is breathtaking because of its enormous size and also because the architecture is so unusual The building features a shapely facade made up of aluminium panels  One of a must visit place in Seoul
8149,4,Yes the structure is stunning Amazing architecture Great atmosphere and lots going on However expected more in terms of exhibitions This changes throughout the year Some boutique shops inside and eateries I just think they could have made better use of the indoor space Clean and well kept Definitely recommend going
8150,4,Interesting art pieces around the plaza Inside is a museum with special exhibits at times Right outside is the Seoul City Tour double decker bus which you can buy a ticket for to enjoy sites around the area
8151,4,DDP is Zaha Hadid design and definitely the icon of Dongdaemun There are a couple of subway stations that stop directly underneath or nearby hence easy to get to The Plaza overall is quite large in size with shops exhibitions and art installations There are leaderboards with maps in many locations hence easy to find your way around Nearby DDP are underground shopping night markets Dongdaemum Gate a couple fo hotels and plenty of shops and restaurants Dongdaemun and DDP are must visit sights when in Seoul
8152,5,Zaha Hadids Dongdaemun Design Park Plaza is the highlight of my trip to South Korea We arrived in the evening and there was a performance with music and high tech projections on the walls of the building We really felt like being in the center of arts and technology Breathtaking  Strongly recommend
8153,5,I enjoyed a really lovely and romantic despite being by myself walk through this area late one evening All of the shops were closing up including the street vendors but it was still great for an evening stroll
8154,5,I visited there two times The structure of this architecture is so dynamic that I felt like Im in city rather than architecture It was memorable
8155,4,I went there two times AM and PM The night scenery is so beautiful So many places to take photos Outside the building there are roses being displayed actually for kdrama shooting but somehow they left it there as it become famous with tourists I would like to recommed coming here during the night
8156,2,For me it was a bit disappointing visiting S Korea I can feel a bit of tension wherever I would go around the city The people were not as warm as expected I dont know if it was due to a language barrier or they were just not trying to be nice Im Caucasian and my wife is Japanese and at a lot of places we went I didnt really enjoy myself It was our first time visiting But as for me I probably wont go back again This is my opinion
8157,4,Definitively worth a visit especially if you are interested in design and arts Depend on what exhibition will be held during your visit but even without interesting exhibition you can visit the building during a sunny day
8158,3,From the outside amazing architecture; just simply amazing but as soon as you step inside the magic disappear rapidly  The space seems to be very poorly used and there is so little design that you wonder where you are  So much potential totally wasted
8159,5,Weird and cool architecture just walk around outside and inside for awhile and get lost Some cool exhibits food and shops
8160,4,Nothing much here but nice walk around It surroundings by few shopping complex which offering various types of things There is food truck night market and performances during weekend if not mistaken Please check before you go
8161,4,Modern building interesting construction rice lights every nights them exhibitions almost every month Just see it
8162,5,There is very little I can tell you about this outstanding and gorgeous piece of engineering and architecture Designed by world renowned architect Zaha Hadid who is an IraqiBritish citizen  The place has conveniently allocated metro entrances beneath the structure I think 3 to be precise Before you get to the building there is a mayor plaza and a walking streetramp that leads you to the heart of it The entrance is beneath the full structure  The DDP of its name means Dongdaemun Design Plaza DDP has the meaning of Dream Design and Play as far as I was informed The place is also famous and renowned for it has staged diverse cultural events including exhibitions fashion shows product launch shows forums and conferences  DDPs exterior features over 40000 aluminum panels none of which are the same As I mentioned before the plaza is home to various exhibition spaces design museum sky lounge rest area and a souvenir shop  Is really a beauty of Art and Architecture as well as Technology We recommend it for a casual visit to attend an event or if you are all of the above; artist architect or engineer Youll be mesmerized
8163,3,DDP LED Rose Garden is closed when we get there  So frustrated not to find it while thinking that it should be where it should be Didnt get any review or advise online that it will be closed so sharing this post which hopefully would help those who plan to go to DDP to see this LED Rose Garden Please check operating hours or any announcement before you go
8164,3,The website or its advertising stresses to get here at dusk However by dusk only a few shops are open The Plaza would be busier if your opening times were more precise Architecturally the structure is definitely worth visiting the design is exciting and futuristic The interior seems unfinished and lacking in spatial flow
8165,4,Nice place to just sit by the steps and enjoy the cold Great for taking pictures as well  Occasionally they have exhibitions here but unfortunately when we went it was already over
8166,5,such an amazing architecturea piece of art and history by Zaha Hadid where the future meets fantasy design takes your breath away Free admittance other than into galleries and class Feel free to walk in and dont trip while your head will be looking up at amazing futuristic style of design and down at the assymetric stairs etc cool cafes inside art classes bookstore seating areas plenty to do
8167,3,Will not visit again Interesting building design from the outside but boring on the inside Noting much to do inside
8168,4,They have Dongdaemun show every night during the winter break  To have artistic show projected on the enormous surface of the Iraqi American designed structure was a sight to behold
8169,5,Excellent gallery beautiful building worldclass art We went during winter and it was great to have some time away from the cold
8170,5,A truly impressive futuristic sci fi looking complex that deserves a wow factor on first impression especially if you just exited the subway stop The grounds and surrounding area are massive you could easily spend two days exploring this area as it also includes historical Dongdaemun wall and gate parkway etc The DDP is an art gallery design complex that has numerous spaces and rooms for outdoor performances and conferences Another interesting factor that there are archelogical finds surrounding the complex area that was unearth during construction and this has been integrated into the overall area This is an outstanding architectural design complex that is impressive when viewed both during the daylight and evening hours
8171,5,This beautifully designed building is part of the Design Plaza with regularly exhibitions and performances There is a small food court area and with few cafes around the basement level of the Plaza It is also a good place to wait for the HopOn HopOff tour buses which makes DDP their main stop for both lines Right across the street and surrounding areas are 56 large department stores some which are opened till 45am
8172,4,Vast building designed by Zaha Hadid covering a few city blocks Definitely worth a visit Various shops and galleries inside and usually a lively market outside
8173,3,The building design itself is interesting Sloping corridor to get to the various levels that locate the museum  From the outside it looks like a gigantic docked spaceship It has two sections the design plaza on one side and a museum on the other  When you are done the shopping is simply overwhelming This is the place for those that do not fancy the bazaar style shopping as in Namdaemun market This place has a few big malls for fashion mostly It has even has two underground shopping malls One at the main street and the other is adjoining the Metro station  Good for photo opp and place to shop
8174,3,The structure of DDP itself loks futuristic something like out of a Star Trek movie However there are not many shops in there and can look deserted I guess you have to appreciate art or design for me there is not much to see except the structure itself
8175,4,The architectural facade of DDP is very unique Outside the building is a good place for watching people and drinking coffee
8176,2,It is a iconic piece of architecture on a monumental scale It was a huge disappointment though there was almost no content and so much of the museum space was closed or empty The shopping area was billed as a design market it was not at all curated as design goods The remains of historical buildings in and amongst the futuristic mega buildings were the most interesting parts of the park Overall the sheer bleakness of the interior was fascinating but I was very frustrated at the lack of museum content The one small exhibit gallery with exhibits in it was okay but not of a scale to fit this giant park So be aware that besides the giant swooping building there isnt anything else to see  The central stair in the design building is amazing there is some striking architecture
8177,5,Beautiful artistic architecture that houses a museum a kids playground a gift shop and underground shopping mall Take the lift up to the roof top and strolled down the ramp while admiring the wonderful view
8178,4,Located in the heart of Seoul this Plaza certainly stands out for its futuristic design Theres a small museum nearby that goes into great detail about the flood control measures that have been implemented Some ruins have been preserved as well
8179,5,Also caled DDP This space ship is a major urban and most iconic landmark in Seoul Build by Zaha Hadid Architects this neofuturistic eccentric compkex is a multipurpose cultural center with galleries event spaces design shops and lawns that rise up to its roof Here is the perfect place to shop 24hour high quality goods
8180,5,Its too cold to truly enjoy the outside of the structure  Great to see the place Luckily there are indoor place to eat and some small shopstore  I didnt buy anything there Also good to sit around have some snacks
8181,5,Visit exhibitions  souvenir shops  enjoy a cup of coffee or a meal in this mega structure  DDP is an architectural beauty that was design by the queen of the crazy structures the late Zaha Hadid Its not your typical exhibition center its a place that you can do multiple activities in while enjoying this crazy structural beauty in a district that never sleeps
8182,3,This building symbolises modem South Korea with its futuristic design The building  is lighted up in the night Inside is a  kind of shopping mall with shops restaurants and halls for exhibitions and cultural programs 
8183,5,Very nice to walk around and see this very modern building Nice and not so big shopping mall as well
8184,3,The design is breathtaking  and very massive The surrounding areas offer a lot of cool shopping and eating spots
8185,5,This area is one of the best place to shop but this time we went here to enjoy the cold weather and take lots of pictures here Truly a wonderful place for photography
8186,5,I stopped by at the DDP at nighttime with some friends and it was a great visit The architectural design of the plaza itself is so unique and definitely worth some photos I believe they tend to have some exhibits are art programs here sometimes but youll have to check out their website There is a History Museum that you can check out as well with free admission
8187,5,This is a very beautiful building spanning multiple blocks in Seoul Its architecture is unique and outstanding from every perspective There are pianos in various locations free to play Around the back there is an upscale street clothing market
8188,5,The building is very attractive in design There are spaces for exchibitions in the building There are art shops and restaurants as well
8189,4,What an amazing building The little shops in DDP were really interesting and worth exploring Spend a lot of time in there Glad that interior is not overly clutter but kept clean and minimalistic The outside was full of activities so it was worth a trip both inside and out
8190,3,Was looking forward to coming here but after marvelling at the structure and sculptures outside we were a bit bemused by the inside We only managed to find a cafe and then a huge hall which was empty except for a couple of Mormon brothers having a rest Not sure what the point of the place is
8191,5,It is a wonderful place to visit Great architecture and atmosphere They have different exhibitions
8192,4,This is a fascinating building which looks great from pretty much any angle There didnt seem to be an awful lot to do there  a small shopping arcade  a gallery for exhibitions plus some historic remains in the grounds with a small museum  but we spent an hour or so there then went and ate in the arcades nearby then came back once it was dark when it looked even better It reflects the light from surrounding buildings  looks quite otherworldly Well worth a brief visit
8193,5,As an architecture buff I found this plaza in Seoul to feature one of the most innovative modern structures that I have seen I first visited the 7level 4 above ground and 3 below building during the day and was so impressed that I returned to introduce the center to my husband that night Designed by architect Zaha Hadid the futuristic construction exhibits no straight lines or right angles Instead it presents elongated curvy forms built with concrete and cloaked in 45000 aluminum panels  At night the centers lights seem to glow from within At certain exterior vantage points its shape and silvery hue give the impression of what I imagine a giant spaceship to look like The park next to the building further enhances the look It holds 25550 LED roses which light up 5 minutes after sunset and are absolutely stunning It was a magical experience to stroll here in the dark  Inside the curves continue in long corridors and connecting stairways there are also standard elevators The center serves as a fairly new venue for design in Seoul featuring an art hall meeting space a museum a design lab and a design market I visited the huge lab which displays a variety of wellcrafted items for sale and gives visitors the opportunity to meet the designers We enjoyed a light dinner in one of the many eateries in the market which is connected to the nearby Dongdaemun shopping centers  DDP located in Downtown Seoul is easily reached by subway Take Line 2 4 or 5 to Dongdaemun History and Culture Park Station and leave through exits 1 or 10
8194,5,We visited here as a nice walk in the evening dont miss this work of art on the beautiful architecture there are so many great things about this building obviously curvy outside is amazing The interior and exterior both are inspiring
8195,4,I loved the outside of this structure with its sinuous metal shape winding around gardens and walkways and couldnt wait to explore further It is beautiful and whatever is going on inside the building itself is worth a visit There were two exhibitions on when I visited which were both quite interesting but didnt really float my boat  but thats subjective they were very well presented and worth the time I spent there Take time to explore the building the nooks and crannies and little architectural surprises are a joy to discover
8196,4,Visited this place after recommended from local The design of the building is very unique especially in the night Do visit this place if in Seoul
8197,5,Glad to be a witness of Zaha Hadids work in Seoul all the curves and the details that house all the creative spaces in the complex such as museums galleries multipurpose halls markets and restaurants such eye candies
8198,4,Went here with my fiance and its amazing The structure of the building is impressive The way they left a piece of history in the middle is great and I love the 2 statues as well If you get hungry there are a few different places to eat Definitely going to go back next year
8199,4,Very nice to go even on a rainyday Seoul showing off their modern arquitecture you can take nice pictures and visit Kako friends shop without the crowd
8200,5,As walk out of the Dongdaemun metro station a huge metal clad curved building takes your breath away Its the Dongdaemun Heritage and Cultural Plaza designed by world famous architect Zaha Hadid the Queen of Curve 20072013 The building blends into the historic landscape of the old Seoul City Wall at the point where the river used to run under the wall there is the aptly named Water Gate  with a timber grill to bar entry The Plaza has sinuous paths to mirror the sinuous building Inside there is a museum and the Cafe de Fressina A visit to the cafe is a must  it is in a huge cavern with the flooring the furnishings and the stunning serving counter designed by Zaha Hadid Have a coffee and cake  snack Walk around a while and take back your breath See my photos
8201,5,This impressive modern building desgined by the prestigious architect Zaha Hadid is the hube of the huge square Theres is a design museum inside that you can visit Sorrounding the metal structure of the building you can visit the restored remains of the ancient fortress There is also a small but exquisit museum dedicated to the old stadium that was demolished to build the square that you can contemplate today The area is plenty of markets shops restaurants
8202,5,This is such a great area to visit Great architecture and lots to do here Shopping outdoor markets food buildings Their buildings are absolutely amazing
8203,5,This building is truly spectacular and definitely worth a visit There is a design museum and design exhibits to see There is also plenty of shopping and dining opportunities around the plaza
8204,5,We admire ZH jewels this is one with rounded forms Could spend hours there Actual exhibition Paul Smith fashion designer
8205,4,Not worth a visit on its own but really cool architecture and a photo op If there be sure to visit the free Stadium Museum next door commemorating the old sports complex build by the Japanese that was demolished to DDP
8206,5,Impressive art in the building It suit the city scenarios very well not disturbing at all Inside also it could be a surprise
8207,4,with a neofuturistic design Located in the center of South Koreas fashion hub  Multiple levels 5 halls The filming location of a couple of different dramas Opened for conferences exhibitions and various events There is park on the roof
8208,5,Such a beautiful place to take picture The building design are unique and beautiful You can enter the underground and enjoy your shopping
8209,4,Exhibitions are well set and have lots of works present Not to mention the building itself which is sick
8210,5,I love this area Its such a treat for my eyes every time I see DDP Such a beautiful architectural design that has to be seen in person as photos dont do it justice Also the shopping here is very good the business hours of the shopping centers is staggered so it offers shopping pretty much 24 hours I prefer this area over Myeongdong although its also crowded its more open with the shopping centers vs outdoor shopping streets
8211,4,Just walking around and experiencing the innovative space new views opening up was interesting The stores  museums Disney inside were of the boring mall variety
8212,5,Very Impressive with the architecture by the late zaha hadid Theres a cafe inside and some shops underground
8213,4,Beautiful place where to spend a night There are some kiosks for street food shops people all around and a pleasant atmosphere The Design of the entire area is just amazing
8214,5,This place simply has to be seen to be appreciated The design is on a large staggering scale and surprises when compared to the many tiny alleyways that are in surrounding neighbourhoods The fashion malls in the area are unbelievable in terms of number of shops selection and pricing
8215,5,Very beautiful lots of English signs and explanation Good for photography walking We got the opportunity to see Seoul metro station
8216,4,Seoul  a city of 24 hour fried chicken beer and shoju with ladies shopping non stop till 5 am in 89 Stories malls of shops including basement shopping  Important note to Seoul  Come with empty luggage as you dont need clothes masks or cosmetics  You can shop till you are broke Always bring cash in Won or   Tips for shopaholic  Remember you can always go back to hotel to shower and reconsider that dress and go back to the mall at 3 am to buy and then celebrate the great achievements of full luggage and extra luggage and then have a late supper of fried chicken with beer after  Most important Download Naver map as Google map dont work in Seoul 
8217,5,Loved the architecture and the shops inside the exhibition area Bought quite a few interesting things there like a bookmark inspired by the DDP architecture and rlly good leather card holder We did not plan to specifically visit this place but it turned out to be so pleasant
8218,3,My hotel was close to this unusual collection of buildings so we took time to explore including the design exhibition  I found the architecture a bit too brutalist but some will like it  The archaeological diggings in the centre of the buildings were interesting with bilingual signage  We found a Vietnamese restaurant chain outlet inside so inexpensively lunched at that  The below ground Metro station is one of Seouls busiest and quite a labyrinth but if confused just ask a younger local as many now speak English and are exceedingly helpful
8219,3,Cool place but nothing special other than the building itself Stores and restaurants inside is like any other typical shopping area A place to stopby while you shop and dongdaemun
8220,3,The building itself is wonderful but full of wasted space You walk around expecting something great but it never comes The shops around the area are a waste of time selling knockoffs and cheap local style ajima style clothing
8221,3,Interesting building but inside there was a huge hall with many unusual chairs which I suppose were interesting but not particularly inspiring The interior is worn and in need of renovation all in all it seemed like a bit of a white elephant
8222,5,Amazing architecture  the work of Zaha Hadid Interestingly arranged interiors  from the design galery to the shopping center Worth a visit
8223,5,Here you can easily spend lot of time impressive place also from outside and inside Loved furniture exhibition where you see and can try design chairs all over from the world
8224,4,Some interactive design fun with chairs and pianos This will either be a nice rest stop as there are tons of seating options inside and some lay down options outside or an enjoyable hangout spot if you enjoy design and art Possibly a great place to get high quality gifts
8225,5,The plaza architect is stunning and exotic Its really cool experience to walk through the buildings There are some cherry blossom at the back of the plaza early April
8226,5,I really like it here They had some pianos laying around so I got to play them I like the idea of entertaining fellow visitors   This doesnt have the LED rose since its an exhibition that ended a long time ago sad But we got to walk around and appreciate the buildings in the night  I know that they over some exhibition at the halls but for Gods sake this place is huge We just had like 30 minutes to go around the area so I really want to go back and visit this place again
8227,4,Cool building outside and in located in the centre of Dongdaemun with the large shopping plazas can come in to have a look around
8228,5,I really love the DDP  first of all its exterior design is so pleasing to my eyes Its curvy and fluid and just super cool In the evening when its lights go on it really looks like a spaceship out of Star Trek I enjoy walking around its many corners adoring them over and over again The inside is as cool as the outside With interesting exhibitions stores and the most interesting stairs this place is really worth checking out and especially if you are into design style architecture and space
8229,4,This building has a very cool architecture style and for those who love photography you can also have a photo hunting day here in DDP
8230,4,This place is good start for people who are still beginner in understanding minimalist art and urban landscape The unique thing about this museum in my opinion that it is the pioneer of art sharing which is seen globally in terms of minimalist and urban art
8231,5,A very stunning building Every corner of this building is a very good photo spot Also dont forget to take photos at I Seoul U sign while you are here
8232,4,This plaza stands out in Dongdaemun area with its large and unique design building It is used to host various exhibitions fashion shows conferences etc The building consists of the Art Hall Museum Design Laboratory Oullim Square and Dongdaemun History  Culture Park Just behind the plaza is a small and quiet park with many free seats with umbrella covers
8233,5,I wasnt actually able to explore the place due to lack of time but I happened to pass by and took a selfie I am awed by its spaceshiplike design I heard this is a shopping place for designer clothes and shoes so I think prices here are more expensive compared to those shopping streets like Myeongdong
8234,4,I like the design of the building  inside and outside There is coffee area as well Love the design
8235,4,this design plaza is a sleek soft metal building with surrounding galleries shops  restaurants which is all very interesting and fun for the entire family there is also the river close by below ground level to explore or picnic
8236,4,Dongdaemun Design Plazas curvy and wave structure catches my eye in a neighbourhood of straight boxy office buildings Without the signages you would not know where is the entrance to the building  We walked around the DPP on a late afternoon to appreciate its exterior Each different angle gives you a fresh perspective of the building  We didnt visit any of the indoor exhibitions There are shops cafe and restaurants in the basement and street artists who could do a quick portrait for you  The DDP is directly connected to a subway station Ill recommend a visit in the early evening
8237,4,One cant miss this delightful building when in the area  but the delightful exterior far exceeds the utilitarian interior
8238,4,If you are a designer or has likes to see various creative work then this is an area you should visit while in Seoul There are a lot of shops exhibits activities that you can visit and experience Coffee shops food shops etcare available as this is located on top of a subway train station Dongdaemum History  Culture Park
8239,5,Good place to visit chill and can be a nice place to explore Recommend for people who interest in any event or designs Flee market and food trucks available sometimes Nice and creative architecture Place to visit for designs and creative goods seeking Temporary events rotate periodically As time of my visit there are many interesting events such as Hello Paul Smith and The Art of Disney The Magic of Animation Flee market and food trucks in the evening as well More spaces to walk around and chill out Easy to access with many public transportations  Idea to visit if you have spare time
8240,4,If you happen to pass by this attraction go ahead and give it a visit You will be marvelled by the designstructure of this building It seems to be a convention area for special events The time we went there were several food and retail carts along the garden area The adjoining underpass had shops to check out Overall a good place to hang out and chill after a long day
8241,4,This building was full of curves and flowing lines that made it one of the coolest buildings we visited Inside an almost all white walkway spiraled up to the top floor making for a long walk along the outer circumference of DDP A staircase with an oddly angled and brown contrasting steps brought us back down  The building and surrounding areas were open 24 hours a day I walked around for free inside but to visit any of the exhibits or museums you just had to pay an admission fee roughly W16000 for adults On the ground floor was a temporary exhibit on Disney animation which seemed to be quite popular There also was a Disney store and lots of silkscreened animation scenes from the likes of Frozen Big Hero 6 and Moana On the second floor was an art museum On the third floor was a childrens play area some collaboration space and on the roof a viewing area and a cafe In the back was a lush landscaped area with seating a piano and various art pieces In the front was a large courtyard where lots of people were congregated  My daughter previously visited during the nighttime and enjoyed seeing the building lit up We will have to visit again
8242,5,The way its made its super unique and beautiful Situated in the biggest shopping district of Seoul This area is surrounded by malls Must visit to click some great pictures
8243,4,Dongdaemun Design Plazas architecture is amazinggreat sight with several shopping centers nearby
8244,4,Glad that we saw this ongoing Disney exhibition from 2019419 to 2019818 Really nice to relive the childhood memories and learnt more about how Disney actually evolves through the years Tickets are  15000 KRW for an adult  Theres another area with cafes and shops Else just take a seat outdoor and enjoy the breeze  We saw the LED rose at night too
8245,5,Dont miss a visit to the DDP if you want to get away from temples for a while and see an ultramodern side of Seoul Aside from the architecture the centre has other attractions and shops When I visited there was a Disney Animation exhibition Definitely worth seeing Oh and if you play the piano there are several dotted around the complex Just sit down and play
8246,5,The building designed by the wellknown late Zaha Hadid looks like a scifi spaceship landed in the middle of the city aurrounded by shopping malls It looks amazing and walking in it feels like inside something surreal Every corner is curved giving the feeling of endless boundary without borders Really very interesting design concept and realization
8247,3,I may have selected the wrong time to visit so take that into account First if you enjoy architecture the building itself is so unique and beautiful that you cant go wrong The building the artistic statues outside perhaps the correct term would be sculptures are definitely worth seeing in person The interior is peaceful and calm which contradicts what you might anticipate looking at the space age like exterior However there wasnt a lot going on inside during my particular visit If you have young kids they would have fun on I believe it was the third or possibly fourth floor
8248,5,Beautiful structure I was so amazed how it was done You have to see it for yourself One of the best place I have visited in South Korea Superb 
8249,4,I came shopping here around Dongdaemun area and came upon this beautiful design plaza It is a great picture opportunity and you can sit or drink and eat around here They have places for you to sit and just chill This plaza is just right behind the station It is convenient and nice to get to
8250,4,Nice place for photo shoot There are a lot of points for photo Sometime has show or exhibition there
8251,4,First time to visit DDP and was impressed with its design Its like an infinity elongated curve from start to end It would be nice if you could see the plaza in its total structure as it is quite unique and futuristic We were there late afternoon and when it got dark the lights gave the plaza an awsome ambience They have this attraction which we visited and waited for hours the socalled led rose garden where hundreds or thousands of roses automatically light up as the sun sets It was a nice view as the night went deeper There are also have art hall museum design lab design market culture and history park but most of them were closed when we were there Its quite tiring if you tour around the big plaza but there are coffee shops and restaurants where you can eat and rest Its good to visit this place
8252,3,I do love design so I was really looking forward to my visit to the Dongdaemun Design Plaza DDP Having dragged my family to it I must say I was  disappointed  Yes amidst Seouls skyline the DDPs facade is aesthetically unique for its fluid lines and steel curvatures There is no doubt its sheer outline exudes design  But once we appreciated the swooping facade and geometries there is just emptiness inside the building empty rooms empty echoey corridors and vast empty spaces For a designer space is a design element but when we went around 4 pm on April 17 there were no exhibits no permanent showcase not even food trucks Just one big EMPTY building  OK if you are a modern architecture design nut and enjoy photographing shapes but you might want to skip this if you have mixed group For a showcase design plaza they really could have done more with it
8253,5,Dongdaemon Design Plaza has a modern architecture Its about 19 mins walk from train station Its a must visit place
8254,4,Ideally for teenagers that love shopping as some of the shops operate till 3am late night and lots branded is on sales ;
8255,4,When we visited it was really cold but there were still so many people around There werent that many food stalls opened as we had hoped for but there was a piano there that we enjoyed playing
8256,4,Its good to see in the daylight but more spectacular at night with all the LED flowers all light up tooThere is a cafe insideLooks like a huge spaceship with its many windowslots of photo opportunitiesThe steps leading out of the area are also light up
8257,5,If you like architecture and are interested in design you definitely should take at least a walk around this spacious building You can also go to the design exhibition
8258,5,A huge design of greatness with glimpse of citys history and culture Went there to watch the rose lights but arrived before dark Amazed Bejeweled Enchanted Must see
8259,2,We arent only to find out there were no exhibits Literally zero things to look at inside Its a nice enough building but we were expecting to see actual design work inside only to discover they were between exhibits have no permanent collections and most people went for the market out front and the childrens playland on the top floor It was very disappointing Would highly recommend finding out if theres actually something to look at before you go else just stop by if its on your way to someplace else Not worth it to go to Dongdaemun just to look at an empty building
8260,5,Generally Seoul has not fine architecturel profile but this DDP is well aesthetic huge building I experienced and felt touching watching listening a functional sculpturea little bit in some where of the DDP I lost or confused about the horizon I advice at least two hours to spent in there
8261,4,We went in the evening There was a food and art fair when we were there A live musical performance as well Food trucks were available and the local youth were spending their evening enjoying the good food and music
8262,4,We stumbled upon DDP after exiting from the subway station It was very crowded at that time as it was Seoul Fashion Week There were many fashionable people dressed up and posing for photographers Very interesting to watch And of course the exterior design by renowned Zaha Hadid is something to look out for
8263,4,Spectacular 3D architecture design Impressive concept Worth a visit Beautiful from inside  outside for photos There was a change of new lease for the shops so we didnt get to see many shops on that day Shops were being refurbished
8264,4,Besides the great amazing architecture the thousands of LED rose flowers art exhibition also one of the most romance attraction at Design Plaza it will close on 300419 dont miss it at night time together with you lover so romantic for photo taking
8265,5,Fashion district and the design of the buildings were very modern and stateoftheart indeed There were also nearby malls and night market
8266,5,This is the worlds largest 3D atypical structure The architecture is amazing It has beautiful graceful curves The whole structure is column free At night time it is lit up and is really pretty
8267,4,The design plaza is so unique with futuristic exterior Inside it likes a maze Without direction information its hard to find the right way Somehow busy due to the fashion week
8268,4,I think this place is a worthwhile place to visit while in Seoul The building is nothing like Ive seen before Easy access via subway
8269,5,If youre into modern infrastructure engineering construction or art muesuem you must visit Dongdaemun Design Plaza This place is perfect for couples or families of all ages This destination is a futuristic multiuse facility that serves as a museum shopping center cafe holds public community events and is connected to the train system Its best to visit at night so you could view the beautiful artificial flowers that lightup The vibe here is very relaxing as people could be found everywhere socializing and being present in the moment
8270,4,I didnt go inside and suspect that it is even more impressive at night but it is impressive to be sure You can exit the subway station directly to it
8271,5,Wonderful park to spend an afternoon Lots of things to see and close to the famous fashion center Connected by metro and located near many restaurants
8272,5,Use Exit 10 to check out the front of DDP illuminated at night  Then walk a long its corridors and admire the changing lights of the structure
8273,5,The building alone is worth the time and then there is so much more going on  I took a couple of hours looking around  it is very organic form and I was really interested in the planting scheme as well Lovely that there were pianos dotted around for anyone to play when i was there and the very nice restaurants inside too
8274,5,Very nice place took a picture of it and check in to Facebook Alot of people as well so its nice Other than that nothing much
8275,5,The architectural design is very unique by following the contour of the surroundings  The thousand led flower lighting was mesmerising in the evening and is great for photography  In addition to near metro station there are nice shops and restaurants there as well
8276,5,Located in a Seoulstyle block dongdaemun design plaza is a extremely strange but spectacular construction Just like zaha always did she made DDP the an unusual construction and a representation of dongdaemun or even the whole Seoul  I always like zahas design and think it very cool to take photo here You can take very instergrammable photos inside or outside the building since the the Zaha style is everywhere here  If you hope to take some pure architecture photos I would recommend you to come the eighth floor of lotte FITIN which is a shopping mall facing to DDP There are lots of clean windows allowing you to take amazing photos of DDP at night In contrast there are some buildings nearby where you can not take satisfying photos for its dirty windows and terrible views
8277,5,This is a must see building in Dongdaemun It looks like a space ship at night with glistering lights all around The inside is white with curves and angles on the stairways that are pleasing to the eyes There was an art exhibition on the ground floor and interesting design items for sale when I was there in the beginining of Feburary There are two cafeterias that I can see on the top floor They even have a piano outside around the middle entrance under cover for passerbys to display their talents You can easily spend half a day there if you are into art and design
8278,2,We went DDP for photostop only I think we just need 1 hour to explore this place There are some foodtrucks in December 2018
8279,5,Located in Dondaemun and very close to our hotel this was a really interesting place to visit for all the family The building is truly stunning and the design resembles something from the future or like an extraterrestrial space ship You can wander around the outside underneath and inside and the different views of the building continually surprise  Inside there were many things happening There is a huge and fantastic play area for children an exhibition of Wallace  Grommit many shops and restaurants and cultural and art displays Even the stairways in the building are far from normal and cleverly designed  Probably the best time to visit is in the evening time and at night when the building comes to life with subtly placed lights so it even more resembles a flying saucer or space ship  During our visit in the evening time there were stands outdoors where people were selling handcrafted items such as jewellery singers and musicians performing and food trucks from the Seoul Bamdokkaebi Night Market offering all kinds of really delicious local and foreign snacks and street food
8280,5,I find the night view of this beautiful and serene amongst the hustle and bustle of the city Its a modern walk thru the garden where you will find lit roses and standalone pianos to be played by any passers by which can be heard from most parts of the spot In the day you can do more with the design labs art halls and others alike
8281,3,Mnet Music Awards 2018 was done here There are free entrance in some areas for exhibits and garden It is located near shopping malls and very convenient to go to because of nearby train station
8282,5,Nice lighting around the area The week that we went there they are having the mama awards but unfortunately we did not see any celebrity Overall the building is nice
8283,5,This museum is both stunning yet totally accessible in terms of bringing good design to all echelons of public and taste It is also situated in a fantastic area of shopping architecture and leisure Allow several hours to visit the area or stay in one of many nearby hotels
8284,4,I visited DDP at night Beautiful building and lights If youre here be sure not to miss the LED rose garden
8285,5,So glad I got to see this building Also Love the shop inside If you are an architect this is a must place to visit in Seoul
8286,4,Unusual and unique gifts all under one roof We bought baby socks a big hexagonal dish a foldable backpack a watch and Kpop paraphernalia We had fun checking out the wares that were on display  Tired and hungry Perkmeup treats are available at the AID cafe Scones sandwiches cake and coffees and teas They were excellent
8287,5,What are pleasant surprise so many lights were light up and the view is nice This building with super modern look
8288,4,the architecture is amazing best time to visit is evening so that you can see the lights  reflections over the huge building there are some exhibition halls inside the building an iconic land mark of Seoul highly recommended
8289,4,Beautiful building Attached with the subway that link to main station Nearby shopping area and restaurants Didnt get ti catch a show there because we didi not plan to But indeed it is a beautiful building to admire
8290,4,To be able to conceive such a beautiful building and making it a reality is awesome Must visit the LED Rose garden at Noght
8291,5,Went there with the intent to explore any design exhibitions In the end plans were mired by the architecture and Kakao store  The architecture was fascinating enough to capture even a laymans eyes At ever angle near the building it was stunning to see it especially closer to sunset Spent some time taking photos of the building Even more fascinating was how the building was not so obtrusive that it was rude to the environment It remained modestly unobtrusive retaining the harmony and yet feature its avantgarde intent  For families they can pop by the Kakao shop for photo opportunities with the cute figurines there Shopping is welcomed there too  The basement has FB outlets and shops The building is conveniently connected to the Dongdaemun History  Culture Park
8292,1,Its a beautiful building and you should visit if you are a champion of significant architecture If you love art you will be shattered with disappointment There is no art here  Changing exhibitions means that all galleries were closed Buildings designed to be galleries have been turned into job fairs malls and food courts Its pathetic that a civic project has been allowed to be so misaligned with the original intent
8293,5,The architecture is stunning but the usage of the space is a bit confusing seems to be more of an exhibition hall than a museum so if you want to see the interior find an event or you will be limited to the hallways and public spaces  That being said I strongly recommend a visit the entrance stairway alone is worth the visit in my opinion and the archaeological area at the base is very interesting
8294,3,Apart from the unique architecture there isnt much to do here Wouldnt recommend coming all the way for this
8295,5,This is a great place to shop for unique gifts and souvenirs We did the majority of our Christmas shopping here
8296,5,you must try this branch of Aori japanese ramen the soup broth is so thick and yummy the sliced pork doesnt smell and it was so soft it melted in my mouth the noodle was not soft or over cooked and it still had a good bite to it i ate here in 2 consecutive days you have to ask for their english menu
8297,4,We were not aware if there was any exhibit going on the time We came at night and did not explore much but it was already awesome
8298,1,Remember  on Monday they closed No one told me even this TripAdvisor that DDP is closed every Monday we took far away travel to DDP from Gangnamgu after myeongdong by train but when we are here is closed only design market is open lost our time
8299,5,Dongdaemun design plaza designed by Zaha Hadid is beautiful and futuristic with curvaceous forms There is artwork exhibited a cafe and much more I enjoyed walking around it and admiring the beatiful forms There are also other stores and restaurants in the surrounding area
8300,4,Its a pretty awesome looking building to go see Its also where all the shopping malls are so its worth it to go see and the light up white roses are just outside
8301,3,The design of the building is unique and theres spiral staircase within First floor showcases designer clothes bags Theres a design museum It is basically a place that shows designers stuff
8302,5,Its a must see appreciate the design of the building and come at night so you can see the different lighting fixtures Also dont forget to see the LED rose garden
8303,5,Unfortunately we missed this as it doesnt open until 1000 which is when we had to leave we were only in Soeul for 23 hours so did the night market and missed this as our hotel hadnt mentioned it was so near The building is stunning shame we didnt get the full experience check the opening timings if your going as it changes weedaysweekends
8304,4,Fantastic structure on the edge of the inner city of Seoul in the bustling markets of Dongdaemun Located on the site of the old baseball stadium the DDP represents a unique piece of building which looks like a huge sculpture in the classic curvy design of Zaha Hadid Carefully built using BIM modelling the building contains galleries shops and public areas inside and outside for just viewing and enjoying the atmosphere The building has lots of secretes and is worth a tour In December 2018 there will be a display of fine jewelry from the famous jewelry house of Switzerland Definitely worth a look 
8305,5,Dongdaemun Design Plaza is a well known architecture and unique structure in Seoul Better be here and be amaze
8306,5,We visited just after sunset around dusk The lights came on shortly after we arrived Fantastic building its great to be able to wander around  view it from all angles Really beautiful so glad we visited
8307,4,When around late afternoon you cannot miss that landmark Got a mix feeling about the place got shops and quite confusing for me The lights displaydesign has dimmed when I was there and not as impressive as initially thoughts but still acceptable view at night Use your imagination and photo app ;
8308,5,Visited this iconic architectural site on 26 October 2018 about 5 PM its the perfect time to take pictures only a couple hours before sunset we still have natural light shadow was softer the angles and length more vibrant The view was breathtaking
8309,5,DDP is a landmark that cant be missed in Dongdaemun Check the design shops and museum in the building for interesting design items There was a street play by a young group about plastic pollution and a Halloweenthemed food truck lane DDP is more beautiful at night
8310,5,ddp has an amazing architecture quiet interesting  Walking was quiet cool and we had a wonderful time  perfect weather when we went there last october
8311,3,Only visited during the day Some people say here that it looks great at night Im sure it would They pulled down a huge baseball complex to build this amazing shell of a building on this site Its great looking on the outside but its the opposite of the Tardis Big on the outside virtually nothing on the inside A couple of unattended sad sort of museums  with boxes etc just lying around  a small shopping centre and a train station entry Must have cost a bomb Nice curvy lines yes practical useful  not at all Underutilised An opportunity lost  a concert hall it should have been or just a modern stadium etc  and I love modern architecture but only if it is functional
8312,5,It is a rare opportunity to visit the Master Architect of the world Zaha Hadid Walk inside and outside and enjoy this rare piece of art Magnificent and FREE
8313,5,I didnt have any expectation going there but it smacked me right in the face I am glad we went there it fulfils its role as design centre there are museum halls marketplace for budding artists and also shoppingeating centre in one place making it a onestop destination for everyone you can definitely have great pictures in the buildings premise just find angles that you like favorite photo spot is the stairs
8314,5,We purposely went there to see the landscape and the building modern and we were like walking under a space ship hoping to meet some aliens there Dont miss the LED Rose garden Did not went for shopping there
8315,5,This beautiful curvilinear building and artwork is an oxymoron to historical and cultural park We only had time to walk the west side of the building and browse the arty design themed shops in the south part of the building There are interesting pieces to buy in these shops Its a worthwhile visit on its own or if some of your party prefers shopping for clothes at the malls across the street and you dont
8316,4,After seeing Koreas traditional houses Dondaemuns design plaza shows the other side of Korea The place is best viewed at night to see how the lights on the building facade highlights its modern designarchitecture
8317,5,This was very near my hotel and it was really impressive at night The building was lit up and looked very modern There was so much to do around the building Highly recommended
8318,5,Try visiting when they hold the evening markets The whole place is amazingly designed hence the name and some of the galleries and exhibits are definitely good Even the stairways are nicely designed not forgetting the lightings a good 1hr walk even when your aim was to shop at DDM
8319,5,The building is beautiful and an amazing work of art The walkways and overhanging beams make for great photos Theres many small boutiques inside that sell some of the most unique gifts and home decor Ive ever seen The top floor has a greenspace and restaurant Great area for just walking around
8320,5,Checked out Dongdaemun Design Plaza at night Cool to see it all lit up Close to a market Had someone playing the piano and a neat LED flower garden
8321,3,We visited the place at night to look at the Led garden It was beautiful It is quite easy to find the Led garden It was quite impressive
8322,5,This Zaha Hadiddesigned building is absolutely stunning both inside and out and is a must see if you are interested in architecture Photos dont do it justice as it is such a vast space from up close Inside there is a large exhibition space featuring young designers which is great for browsing for gifts Outside it is a short walk through the park to the shopping area of Dongdaemun
8323,5,Come over to experience one of the last great architectural masterpieces by Zaha Hadid It will not disappoint She quickly understood that Seoul is defined by its seven rings of mountains Resembling a blobby mountainscape you can walk on top of the complex and see the mountains yourself Come at about dusk The night illumination of this building is stunning Inside one of the wings has a great collection of design stores that is easy to walk through and enjoyable to browse The other wings have changing exhibitions and shows Incredibly easy to get to as it is connected to the subway Dont forget the world famous GwangJang Open Market featured on travel shows worldwide for the cheapest and best eats Take a stroll along the Cheonggye Cheon Canal to get away from the city
8324,5,We arrived just before sunset  had the chance to see the transformation of this piece of art with the day  night time An absolute gem in the Centre of Seoul Worth going to appreciate the beauty created by an amazing artist
8325,5,It was fun in there and the epic designs of structures are superb Definitely an instagramworthy place Spend the afternoon there while waiting for our flight back to our country and it was the right decision
8326,5,Visited the DDP at night and it was so beautiful The architectural beauty of Zaha Hadids design is accentuated at night with lights to wonderful effect Didnt enter the building rather enjoyed the building and sculptures from outside Definitely worth a look
8327,5,Beautiful Hard to find the entrance Great outdoor space as well The area has shopping and food Make sure to look for the rose garden
8328,4,Great locationand everything looks new suitable for girls stay Easy going to all major points with metro or taxi and many good food choices around Definitely will choose it again
8329,4,We were lucky that this beautiful piece of architecture was located almost next to our hotel This place is really amazing Walked around for one hour and took pictures from every direction The forms are just amazing It also stores a museum and some shops Opposite the famous shopping buildings Lotte and APM wholesale
8330,3,I think most people come here to see the unique architecture But if you like art go inside Many shops there sell novelties and artsy things
8331,5,its better to visit DDP at sunset so you can enjoy a breathtaking view from the building and enjoy the vibrant walking areas
8332,4,This building is definitely oneofakind in Seoul with its neofuturistic design and massive perimeter kind of looks like a UFO IMO Best visited at night when all of its lights are switched on Tip For foodies like myself there is an awesome food court at Doota Mall opposite DDP Basement 1 Worth a visit
8333,5,Sculptures were fascinating and architecture amazing definitely worth a walk around and spend some time relaxing with a coffee
8334,4,The Design Plaza is an interesting building and if you are in the neigbourhood you should drop by Wheter its worth a major detour depend on whats on display
8335,3,It is better to view this from a distance so you can appreciate the whole architecture But once inside there is not much to do
8336,5,It is a very interesting building especially for someone who loves to take architecture pictures  There is a small russian district nearby
8337,4,Im not much into artworks but my sister really wanted to go so we headed over From the outside it is stunning with a couple of lovely statues and inside is pretty cool too  though not as much to see as I thought there would be A few of the areas were pretty enjoyable to look at and I enjoyed the design plaza with all the different shops  lots of cute little items for sale
8338,4,The building itself is greatespecially if you like architecture photography The shops downstairs are nothing special but as its close to Dongdeamun Market its certainly worth a look around
8339,5,While staying in Dongdaedum visited DDP many times Loved the Farmers Market the LED flowers at nightand the design shops full of interesting and innovative products Such an interesting building and the space around it
8340,4,During my short trip to Seoul I tried to walk around the city as much as I could and found that stumbling upon the DDP around night was one of the highlights of my time there Its absolutely stunning theres ample space to just sit and relax chat with friends or take in the sights Lots of stores as well including a LINE Friends one that was super interesting to check out and do some souvenir shopping at Not sure it this would still be here but there were also lots of popup pianos that you were welcome to use and created a really awesome atmosphere Nearby electronic rose garden was also absolutely stunning Overall even if you cant stay long definitely try to stop by the DDP during your time in Seoul
8341,4,Omg this place you can shop and shop till you drop many many kinds of fashion outlets and all the newest fashion are found here
8342,5,a new place to hangout and very stylish even at night People are very relaxed and theres night markets every Friday and Saturday Though not many foods for selection you wont regret visiting
8343,5,We visited the Dongdaemun Design Plaza late in the afternoon after a day of sightseeing as I was interested in seeing the ZahaHadid designed building in real life  The building itself is breathtakingly beautiful and equally impressive in my opinion and worth the trip alone What makes it even better is that there is a very large kids play area on the top floor that provided hours of airconditioned fun for our kids on a very hot day In a busy city like Seoul that does not have a tremendous amount of activities for kids note we live in Sydney Australia so were very spoilt for choice this can be an absolute life saver and I dont understand why the play area is not advertised more  If I were to make a top 3 of things to visit in Seoul the DDP would definitely be in it
8344,4,Very impressive architecture Saw the led roses lit up at night Beautiful There were stalls selling handmade accessories and essential oils There were also carts selling food and drinks at night Prices are quite high tho
8345,5,The architecture is beautiful and very futuristic looking There are a bunch of shops inside The second time I came here in 2015 I think there was some type of event going on outside with a stage set up and some music artists were performing It was no one I recognized and I think they were rehearsing for something later in the day or evening It definitely seemed like things were still being set up The subway stops right at the DDP so its convenient to get to via subway You could spend so much time just taking photos outside before even going inside to explore Its also close to Doota and other shopping areas right across the street so expect to spend a few hours in this area if you want to go shopping
8346,4,We went there primarily to shop nearby and took a coffee break inside one of the cafes The structure is really impressive for the architecture and good for photos It is also a subway stop so its handy to exit here and look around this shopping neighborhood
8347,4,Love how this place offer bazzars and some events They have some good places to go My favorite is kakao store
8348,5,enjoyed the design and if you go in the evening it is decorated with colorful light found not much to do
8349,4,This is a huge place full of interesting architectural designs There are some shops indoors; another museum cool eatingcafe area inside Lots of great spots for pics My daughter was there a couple of months ago during Fashion week  said you could see all kinds of ordinary people dressed wild over the top  cool during that time around there  Our favorite part was relaxing outdoors on the big blue lounge beds You must take your shoes off  then just lay down relax  enjoy the shaded breeze
8350,4,As many are aware of the design is the work of the famous Zaha Hadid Looking very cool with futuristic curvy edges But the inside is not impressive There were just a few events and shops It felt like a newly built office building There are some things to have fun though I found a free piano to play near the entrance in the middle
8351,5,Actually I didnt take many events there When I was there there were some special exhibition or shows but I didnt have enough time so I cant enjoy them But I looked around design shops and design museum there and it was great experience
8352,4,There are so many amazing buildings in Seoul to see mostly historical palaces but theres something new and very impressive to see Dongdaemun Design Plaza DDP it is rather futuristic  The DDP is divided into a Design Hall Art Hall and Museum Hall the whole complex is free to the public to visit we walked through one of the buildings but got more joy out of walking around outside  The complex was built on the former sight of Dongdaemun Stadium built by the Japanese in the 1920s during the Japanese occupation During the process of redevelopment of the sight relics were found which are now displayed on a large surface under the canopy of the curved roofline There are many other interesting things to see do and eat in the area its a great part of Seoul to explore
8353,3,Its definitely worth seeing and walking around the exterior of this building but it wasnt worth paying 10000 Won to visit the museum inside There wasnt much in the museum and it featured some drawings paintings and hanboks There was a gift shop in the museum
8354,5,What a fantastic idea So much creativity to see and on the day we went there was an African food market Typical Seoul to always be thought provoking and creative Great coffee shop inside if you need to shelter from the heat or cold too
8355,5,Visited the Van Cleef  Arpels exhibit Worth the visit  Very nice outdoor fashion show also Nice music 
8356,4,This is the place where Seoul Fashion Week is conducted and it sits near the famous Dongdaemun Shopping Area The building is contemporarily artsy and most people come here to take pictures on the photogenic spots
8357,5,I went to the DPP for the first time a few years ago checking out its architecture and the galleries inside Its a must visit for anyone who visits Seoul in particular if you are interested in architecture and design Great photo ops both day and night When I went this time for the exhibition on The Art of Aardman Animations Wallace and Gromit  Friends it was pouring Glad that I already had a detailed look on my last visit Despite the heavy rain a trip there to see the exhibition was very worthwhile The exhibition has already gone to Germany and Australia and is in Seoul now Lucky I could catch it here I am a huge fan of Aardman animations and had a great time viewing the sketches videos original sets with all the details If you go note that photo are not allowed except at 4 spots
8358,4,Besides the beautiful architecture of the DDP we have not visited the galleries the highlight is the LED rose garden which looked so beautiful at night A must visit when in Seoul
8359,5,Very artistic and very big but very interesting Lots of things happening inside even if you didnt want to do anything its just nice to be there and enjoy the scenery Lots of shopping opportunities Love Seoul
8360,3,The only cool thing about this place is the design of the plaza and the rose led garden so go at night to see it lit up Shopping is the same as everywhere else I like Namdaemun market more than Gwangjang market because the street food is better Im not a big souvenir shopper so once you see 1 market theyre pretty much the same except for the food variety If youre tight on time you can stay in this area and skip Myeongdong and Namdaemun Theyre pretty much the same but this area is cleaner and more modern If street food is more important to you and youre shopping for eyeglasses Myeongdong and Namdaemun have more street food variety and eyeglasses selections
8361,3,went to dongdaemun and pass by the DDP for a look around wonderful architecture but thats just it nothing special inside
8362,2,The design of the complex is great but that is all about it Many empty stores and spaces Better to be seen than visited
8363,5,No doubt DDP is one of the most interesting sites to see in Seoul Designed by famed Iranian architect Zaha Hadid DDP is a fascinating contradiction to the squarish city that is Seoul To really appreciate the marvel visitors need to spend at least half a day walking and discover all its nooks and crannies
8364,5,As great it is to walk around you should really go in and check their design stores with some tasty coffee
8365,4,The name of the place speak for it Its a very decent plaza to hangout for awhile all specially created gifts toys travel item etc One of the booth attract me its the 3D printing you take pictures surrounded by lotsa camera from 4 direction and the owner can print your photo into 3D form But a little costly for me 25CM size cost you 550000 won
8366,5,Nice building and design Walking distance to dongdaemun shopping district There is a museum too Visit if you enjoy design and arts
8367,5,This is my first encounter with zaha hadids architecture and can finally understand her talents Every architect who is aspiring to be great should come here to study her work Architectural documentation does no credit to her
8368,3,Happy Ive seen it architecture alone is breathtaking But nothing else Its just a fancy mall Come if you want to drop your kids to a playground come for food trucks and coffee shops come for cheap memorabilia shopping You wont find here anything you may not find elsewhere in Seouls markets Set your expectations straight youll have a great time Come for design art modernism youll leave craving for more
8369,4,Beautiful building designed by Zaha Hadid Even though nothing of interest went on inside or around the building for me it is worth an hour just to look around the building
8370,5,I was amazed by this building seeing all the curves I am an engineer so i appreciate from its exterior alone I wonder how they have drawn this There were nice buildings also within the vicinity so i guess visiting this place is worth it from the shopping plazas around here There is alao an ancient Seoul city wall under and a LED rose garden which is better seen at night
8371,5,Easily accessible by Dongdaemun History and Culture Metro station Big and beautiful building rather unique and artistic design A great place to walk and take a stroll at in the evening if you are coming to Dongdaemun lots of shopping and eateries opposite it
8372,5,The design of the building is fabulous At night it looks amazing It shows Seouls modernity I recommend to visit it
8373,5,This place is a must to see The architectuur can you campare with the modern part of Valencia or the Gugenheim building in Bilbao In the building you will be surprises buy the rolling lines of the walls
8374,5,This is a very artsy place where designers or architects would love it Even so do come and take a quick visit before heading over to Dongdaemun for your shopping  There are many exhibits which are quite interesting to see and you can chill at the rooftop grass field
8375,5,The design plaza is interesting to visit with many modern sculptures and exhibits I went to the Aardman exhibit displaying many canimated creations such as Shawn the Sheep and Walace and Gromit They explain the many different aspects that make clay figures into a movie the final product The exhibit provides you with original set pieces drawings and characters previously used After you finish at the exhibit there is a picture taking area where you can pose with you favorite characters of the Aardman studios The building is interesting modern and unique Would definitely recommend
8376,4,What I love It s the design The Main building is so stylish There is a nice garden around with lot of pleasant sitting area All around you ll find department store that open all night long Enjoy
8377,5,I only spent a while here because of time restriction but if you wait until evening the food truck will be open for business and the surrounding will be lit Inside there are lots of exhibits and art market On the top floor they have a beautiful roof top garden and some restaurants Definitely an artsy place I would recommend if you love art and design
8378,5,It is amazing area for shopping especially at night there is beautiful designs of clothes with good prices
8379,3,A very artistic and modern plaza where local youngsters love to hang around There are special labs for art students seminar rooms auditorium and a library On certain days there performance for budding young people to show cast their talents singing dancing as well as flea markets selling their handicrafts from jewelries to caricature It is situated right opposite the Dongdaemun shopping district If you happen to be in the area do take a stroll in the plaza to have the feel of arts
8380,5,The place itself its amazing and the expositions inside are changing constantly and very interesting We were there for the Fashion week and the location fitting amazingly with the event One of my favorite places of the area The surroundings have a lot of cool places to visit too
8381,4,It is a nice building surrounded by malls and restaurants Good for photo taking but the place itself has nothing much Perhaps spend an hour or less there take some photos and move to the shopping malls nearby or find a nice cafe to relax There is a tour bus station hopon hopoff nearby and a metro station right beside
8382,4,I cant forget the view that welcomed me to this mall so many LED roses bulbs all aglow Good thing we went there at night Plus weather right now is good spring season not too cold and not too hot Plus I was so ecstatic when I saw the area where my favorite Kpop group performed a dance Highlight boy band last year  woohoo
8383,5,At first glance the DDP looks like a set from a scifi movie more like a giant space ship The building has a very modern and futuristic design so it makes a very nice background for photos Dont forget to go to the back for the LED roses which light up at night There are not too many shops inside the building though But there are a lot of stores surrounding the DDP where you can do your shopping Worth the visit
8384,5,Upon arriving at the DDP  as soon as I stepped inside I can instantly tell the design was by the famous Zaha Hadid He buildings are huge and have very unique designs It is definitely a place for those who love art and architecture or even photography as the building offers a lot of amazing angles to shoot from The exterior of the building contains a section that has a lot of glass flowers that light up at night This building is useful during the day for daytime interior visits and also glamours at night time when the flowers light up 
8385,5,Only stopped here because the building looked so cool from outside my husband and I were on a bus tour Didnt go inside but walking around the building is cool enough; cool vibe and great people lots of food stands around and great architecture would highly recommend
8386,3,The only unique experience here is the building features and the way the path is design Building is quite big and there is a mini flea market going on the day I was visiting Thus there are some local product on sales where they promote their products
8387,3,The only nice thing I saw around this place is the colorful piano The white roses looks dirty already and even their lights are getting dimmer Hope they clean or fix them tho They look better when brighter You can spend a hour or two here and thats it unless theres an event or something
8388,5,In awe of the architectural structure its designed by Late Starchitect Zaha Hadid Its a must visit mostly for the architecture Their Archive cafe is also very nice with really good breads and hot chocolate
8389,4,Interesting art pieces around the plaza Inside is a museum with special exhibits at times Right outside is the Seoul City Tour double decker bus which you can buy a ticket for to enjoy sites around the area
8390,2,This is exotic and nice building for sure Made several shots of it But inside I was expecting something unusual inside as well however theres only food and shops Sometimes exhibitions
8391,4,In this plaza there is a exhibition hall and fortunately I went there when Pixar had a big event on their 30th anniversary I had a great time with my kids watched all the history of Pixar and got more knowledge of how did they made animation movies such like Toy Story UP etc
8392,3,Impressive place in terms of design but lacks an information counter or signages in English Good to walk around if you have no agenda
8393,5,The Dongdaemun Design Plaza was amazing i came here in the night and the lights make it more magical to see Since the mall around here they open 24 hours so this area will be packed by tourist and local who shop
8394,5,If you are ever in Seoul and want to enjoy modern architecture the Dongdaemun Design Plaza is a MUST
8395,5,This amazing building has to be seen to be appreciated Go to the top floor and out to see the green roof walk up and down the stairs explore the inside There are many small shops selling design goods and souveniers and cafes as well
8396,4,Not really a big attraction but it does have dining options and a interesting area for photos at night The LED rose garden is worth seeing at night without it being too crowded It is tucked away in the back of the building with stone walls surrounding making for architecturally intriguing photos When Seoul Fashion Week is held here it is great place for people watching
8397,4,Their operating hour is TuesdaySunday from 10AM to 7PM with extended hours of up to 9PM during Wednesdays and Fridays This landmark is very accessible since it is connected to Seoul Subway through Dongdaemun History  Culture Park Station There are also a lot of shopping malls and duty free shops around the area including stalls that appeared to turn into a street market at night
8398,5,A beautifully constructed building great place to go at night  take pictures Coffee shops inside
8399,5,A must see in Seoul especially at night Very impressive architecture by late Zaha Hadid she was an IraqiBritish architect Looks like an UFO has landed Has a lot of interesting design shops inside
8400,5,Its an amazing center of design and market The architecture looks like a spacecraft and inside you find many shops and restaurants Dont miss it
8401,4,We walked through a big modern coffee shop gate A3 inside the DDP and out into the led rose light garden which was outdoor During night time it was brilliant the glowing rose flower lights shine bright and lovely filled the gardens in DDP 
8402,5,I can say we were lucky because in our everyday itinerary we need to pass by in Dongdaemun Design Plaza The modern amazing architecture is simply picture perfect We had the opportunity to view this beautiful architectural work both day and night This is near Dongdaemun shopping districtmarket It is worth your time to visit if you happen to be in Seoul
8403,5,If you are into modern design and architecture this is the place to visit Designed by the late Zaha Hadid marvelous building
8404,4,Showcases modern architecture of curves and modern materials There are art shops inside that features unique designs There is a pay museum at upper level You can also relax at gardenopen areass around the building Right across the streets are several shopping malls some at duty free prices
8405,5,Theres a rose lampions  near the gate and people definetly came here to take a picture with that it was so beautiful tho Inside the Plaza we can buy souvenirs the place was so huuugee and incredible theres also a lot of restaurants and stores nearby
8406,4,I enjoyed seeing and being there it was something unusual but interesting and modern there were many traditional restaurants nearby
8407,5,Modern space Good shops and restaurants inside I tried Aori ramen They have cubicles for the introverts I just didnt have much fun because there are a couple of couples on my left and right who wouldnt stop chatting The division didnt stop them But the food was delicious I will be back this springtime Yay
8408,5,Very modern and impressively designed and on a subway station and near the Dongdaemun fashion towers and department stores Modern crafts to buy A welcome addition to the tourist trail in central Seoul
8409,4,The out side is in aluminium panels The interior has wood staircases with a very interestin design Is different exhibitions Souvenir shoprest area Subway lines 2 4 or 5 can get ypu there
8410,5,Chanced upon this place while visiting a local market Very impressive structure that is worth a visit in its own right
8411,5,its a must visit building in South Korea a masterpiece by zaha Hadid building without edgesall about the curves from outside to inside It has beautiful large park on the site and also roof garden completed with many function in one building shoppes museum etc its an honour for me to be there
8412,3,Definitely an area that appeals to people who like shopping Lots of shops and bargains to be had Metro nearby
8413,4,Looks wonderful on the outside Good for pics The shape is artsy and interesting We didnt do much inside other than wander around
8414,5,A must see when in Seoul For photographers of all levels this massive and unique design looks spectacular at night During the day it is a wonderful place to find younger locals who are always willing to practice their English with youand of course a selfie or two
8415,4,There are many little shops in this Plaza but the most interesting is the building itself Inside and out is it a marvel
8416,4,I was there in the night Not really sure what to see except the fake roses field The roses are so beautiful in the dark
8417,4,We went here on Sunday night to enjoy LED Rose Garden We came from exit 1 of Dongdaemun History and Culture Park station The building was so awesome There was a skating rink there Besides of rose garden there was some exhibitions inside the building Some of the exhibitions were free
8418,4,The place looks surreal but I enjoyed visiting it especially since we went there at night The building is a sight to see definitely but nothing much to do there There is some shopping inside but the malls across the street from the DDP are more interesting We looked for the touted thousand lighted roses but they were a dud They looked like their lights were on their last blink and they were not worth braving the very cold temp for One visit is enough for me
8419,5,Shop till you drop or take a walk with art it its futuristic form Even when it is closed it will still make you awe with their thousands and thousands LED ROSES at the back and the night spot lights emphasize the sexy contour of the building
8420,4,This is a cool spot in downtown Seoul I enjoyed walking around and through the rather large plaza and building designed by a probably pretentious architect with an idea of modernism Still there are plenty of shopping options and overpriced cafes 
8421,5,Marvel through the architecture wonder by Zaha Hadid We enjoyed browsing through the designers item on sale at the time of our visit The building is pretty at night
8422,5,The exterior of the building is absolutely striking and the interior is just as fascinating The current exhibition looks neat but it seemed a bit pricey and small It is an interesting place to visit if you like taking pictures and its a place that you are going to like it or hate it
8423,4,eye openers for new idea and design great place to visit if have time from major sight seeing places in Seoul
8424,2,Soooooo boring Dont know Some people like the building but inside nothing interesting Only few expencive shops Was glad to see a good shopping center nearby so it made the way there not so useless 
8425,4,Just the building and the surrounding area alone are worth a visit There werent many exhibitions going on when we were there though so the design shop was actually the most interesting thing inside with so much cute anime or kpop inspired things or design pieces
8426,5,This huge unusual building has no corners or straight walls Walk around it and enjoy the interesting surface of the building You will also pass the old city wall If you are smart you take an elevator of a the highest highrise building next to the DDP Once you have reacherd the top floor cross the roof by foot and from the staircase of the connecting building you have a perfect view on DDP and the old City wall
8427,5,We came to see the rose led installation but since it wasnt dark yet they werent lit The building is pretty cool architecturally and we enjoyed walking around the complex There was a lot of walking space free from vehicular traffic Also we walked inside a couple of the buildings Entrance is free
8428,5,If you love beautifully designed contemporary buildings then its worth checking out DDP We visited while there was a fashion show and there was a lot going on but theres also some shops and some art museums and stuff I believe theres kpop groups performing here from time to time as part of 1theks Run To You project so you might even be lucky to catch a performance
8429,5,Nice disigned structure and cultural space there is 2 times of fashion week a year nearby Dongdaemoon market easy to access with metro
8430,5,A great place to see modern buildings with unique designs There are shopping malls  art museums to visit Very nice view and a picture perfect place if you are in Seoul Not to miss this place You can also catch the Seoul Bus Tour here
8431,5,Incredible this construction The Building is amazing and the gardens are very well organize Dongdaemun has lots of things to do museum temporary expositions and shows
8432,5,Located next to the Dongdaemun History and Culture Park subway station DDP looks amazing in its design I wasnt into architecture as much but it was a great to see something this unique In addition to the exterior there were exhibitions inside that showcase some intriguing and quirky everyday products from local designers that can be bought DDP is surrounded by multiple shops in the Dongdaemun area so it can be a little side trip from shopping
8433,4,This place should be best to visit at night when the lights come on An impressive building by day the structure and its surrounds really comes alive when the sun sets and the various angles get enhanced by the external lights
8434,5,Although there are still some minor works going on in the interior and exterior this is an extremely avantgardistic and impressive project  at the site of a former stadium Dont miss the selfguided audio tour 4000 Won with good background information on 16 stops outside and inside the complex Also some design oriented shopping opportunities on site
8435,5,This is an astounding building inside and out totally dedicated to cutting edge design in its many forms Different studios office space conference areas some shops and  We went on Monday Most of the shops are closed then But we loved seeing the building from the inside and exploring the area around it If contemporary design does not interest you just drive by
8436,5,This is a great piece of art by a world famous architect who had left us with many of her designs in other parts of the world Also the Seoul government committed a big piece of land in the city for such project clap clap clap Inside the building is many shops for design items that I have not all visited Will plan to go again the next day
8437,4,Newest landmark connected to the subway and history and culture park station There are some building artitechure statues There is a park way Near by are shopping malls street market and seoul city wall and museum
8438,5,Dongdaemoon Design Plaza is very famous for its unique design  interesting displays This monument is located very close to variety of shopping areas including Dongdaemoon Market and Doota Shopping Tower
8439,4,Nice place to visit The architecture of the building is unique and interesting Also a lot of stalls selling artsy and unique things from bags to cellphone accessories Lots of places to seat outside as well
8440,5,Very beautiful building very strategic place There are so many shopping centers around the building The night view is amazing there are so many shop inside the building but the price is rather high compare to other store This place is accessible though the metro A must see place in Seoul If you going for a shopping I recommend you to visit Doota just next to the building The gift shop there are cheap
8441,4,Subway can reach Very convenience You can shoot some nice photos there Other than that nothing much inside It sell alot designer product
8442,4,Worth a train ride just to see its enormous structure Theres some shopping stalls inside but a expensive
8443,4,Love the designs by zaha hadid architects so went to visit DDP in Seoul Night view is just amazing must see there are some shops inside and also museums
8444,5,World famous architect designed building A wonderful costume display when we visited interesting retail outletsreasonably priced clothes amongst the boutique shops
8445,5,Youll probably bypass this location Youre loss So many free items to enjoy There are different types of things to experience
8446,5,designed by zaha hadid many exhibitions are open here also there are many designed shop in DDP
8447,5,I couldnt help but think of the Sydney Opera House and the Sagrada Familia when I walked around this structure and marvel at the what we can do today with the help of modern engineering and technology
8448,4,It is a very popular place but it is more saying that it rally is Has some cool places but not enough for a big place Ill doble think if I go there again
8449,5,As a student of architecture and I especially liked the unique architecture of this work It was created by Zaha Hadid a great architect  I really admire Architectural exterior as well as inner space is extremely great Inside the building is a shopping area with art shop  and an art exhibition place Behind have a rose garden are combined with light creating a space like heaven 
8450,5,I went to this exhibit which is mainly housed at the DDP and was wowed First the architecture of the building itself is really very unique with its undulating curves and color Very futuristic and stylish Then the main attraction was the exhibit which was incredible It was very obvious that a lot of work went into perfecting it and I really appreciated it It was so full of information that one visit would not be enough to soak in all the knowledge We had a tour guide and that worked out really well because she saved us from having to read and glean all the information ourselves She highlighted everything for us and answered all our questions Even that took some time The tour may be enough for some people but those who really want to delve into the exhibit can return and use the tour guide as a roadmap for tackling everything The other part of the exhibit was located in Donuimun Museum Village and we went there as well They really complemented each other very well Well worth a day trip and a return visit time allowing
8451,2,The building and the history points on site are nice but otherwise its just shops on the inside  My girlfriend said it was one of the top ten things to see in Seoul but I reckon you could safely miss this one
8452,4,We went to this shop twice as it had so many interesting items made by students in the design school Most were a little pricey but good to see the creativity that went into the final products
8453,2,Other than the brilliant architectural design of the premises there is nothing inside No exhibition and just some stores only
8454,5,one of the mustsee places in Asia Id say It is very futuristic zaha hadid made an incredible design The shops downstairs offer designer gadgets clothing home accessories toys etc It is an incredible place and the coffee shop is nice I suggest getting a mango beverage
8455,5,This is a wonderful modern complex that is stunning to view just from the outside Inside are many galleries and exhibitions and the interior design is equally as impressive as the exterior Some of the exhibits do charge but the complex as a whole is free
8456,4,As a fashion shopping area for young people I would recommend it as a place for tourists that there is no design for older women if there is in the sightseeing and trendy designs everyday
8457,4,The Design centre has several exhibition floors where you can find both local and overseas designers with their innovative art products Some are of artistic value while others are product of daily use Some special exhibitions are free of charge on Eednesday The souvenir shop on ground floor features a lot of innovative gadgets Worth a half day visit
8458,5,Even if you arent interested in the exhibition inside visit at night and walk around the complex The lighting reveals how magical this architecture is It will surely steal a lot of photo taking moments  When you visit inside during the daytime you will even more amazed how marvellous this architecture is You will be like strolling along exhibits on the walkway rather than in exhibition rooms Without knowing you will already be on the top floor or bottom floor There are lifts inside but if your physique allows try walking
8459,5,The building here so artsy and futuristic Be prepared to amazed since its not something u always get to see and there are also garden of led roses that shines in night Best to visit day and night
8460,4,The plaza is big and the design is unique It has shops and eateries and a nice place to hang around It is also near to the night market A very lively place indeed
8461,4,Awe Inspiring architecture lots of exhibitions design and concept stores Great picture opportunity
8462,5,Was floored by this building Great for photo opportunities Very unique style Lots of querky gift shops inside too which are good for souvenirs  Located right by metro exit Make sure you spend some good time here to look around Lots to see
8463,2,I guess check it out if youre in the Dongdaemun area for shopping Nothing to do here besides get overpriced coffee and take photos
8464,5,I really love this place The building is huge the complex is interesting i like the minimalistic inside and the design The hole plaza is nice I was there for the Biennale of architecture n urbanism  sad fact though is that there is a market area in the inside where unfortunately random shops are located
8465,3,My fav building in seoul Beautiful landscapes and architecture designs in n out Worth a visit while u r here
8466,4,we had a stroll at night the buildings architectural design is cool and pretty There were some shops inside and lots of open areas to hang out
8467,2,This is an attention grabbing building with little utility There is little going on inside Some shops selling modern design wares venders cafe Nothing substantial The Dongdarmun Market bldgs are still there with its shops crammed with products
8468,5,t must go there A magnificient design Like a museum but its more than that Should visit on Saturdays night They have a garden of neon roses So great
8469,2,While the building on the outside was pretty cool there was little happening with the actually space There was no reason to even go inside it  a quick walk around on the outside is all its worth
8470,4,If you do not know where to spend your night in Seoul this place is not bad It is windy at night There was a public piano put at the street anyone can play My girl who likes to show off enjoyed it so much _
8471,5,We came here to have a stroll at night and this place was simply beautiful There were loads of food trucks if you want to have some street food The LED roses also made the place even more beautiful Good for a night stroll and some picture taking at night
8472,5,its an architectural master piece in my eyes Never seen something like this anywhere I love the night market and truck food LED rose lights at night makes it charming enough Head to Dongdaemun history and cultural park station for direct access  Dongdaemun station is next station and you might need to walk back to reach there  Outside of DDP there are lots of shop and the famous Migilore and Doosan shops Eat n shop
8473,3,The Dongdaemun design plaza is a beautiful structure You can find here a few big fashion musea with a few big event halls although I never had the luck to visit anyone of them Everytime I visit the place about every couple of months there are no events The design plaza is a good place to relax in a quiet place away from the buzz outside in the many fashion shopping malls right beside
8474,4,You dont see this type of building in your day to day life A moden marvel of architecture A place where people who love archetecture can enjoy my kids were not interested though
8475,5,this place is very big and so many tourist its not even a problem here maybe because its near to shopping mall and food truck outside we bought some souvenir at the road down there and the street food look really tempting yall really should try that
8476,5,What started as an attempt to see the flowery lights that we only see in kdramas  I was surprised to find that on the Saturday night that there will be loads of food trucks lines up in the vicinity of the DDP Boy the choices was good looking the portion of some of the order it was also quite filling and not to forget smells soo delicious We just had dinner  therefor was too full  But we did share a churros  which was awesome Crunchy on the outside with a soft chew fluffy insides   Besides foodtrucks there were selfmade artist selling their arts and also a blowup balloon arts that was everywhere  a very good night out and loads of photo Opps Do checkout this is on the weekend The night life from cheonggyecheon river to the malls opposite the DDP seems like its always busy with something during Saturday late evening to night   TIPS for those who doesnt have much time to spare in korea these places are all within walking distance to checkout  Cheonggyecheon River end  Grill Fish street  Dongdaemun Shopping Malls Multiple BIngsu places multiple Train stations nearby  if you come in the morning even have a historical landmark tooforgotten the name sorry but the DDP is quite central easy to make it a landmark InCaseOfLost among a big group  ENjoy
8477,4,Dongdaemun is a pretty interesting place with its countless street markets and architectural design but its nothing really more than a few photo ops here or there I do visit Dongdaemun frequently to clear the head after a heavy night out but there really isnt anything you would write home about If you are into photography it is a fantastic place to practice your depth of fields and length snapping but its nothing compared to the palaces you have on offer a mear 3 or 4 stops away in Jonggak or City hall I suggest visiting only if you have bags of time and you are passing Dongdaemun on the subway
8478,4,If you are into Architecture you must visit Dongdaemun Design Plaza I went here with great expectations and totally amazed with the building  although I am not a fans of zaha hadid style of Architecture The building itself is breathtaking because of its enormous size and also because the architecture is so unusual The building features a shapely facade made up of aluminium panels  One of a must visit place in Seoul
8479,4,We went there for the night market We were attracted by the Kakao Friends shop and spent some time there taking photo The Night market opened at 630pm and it is outdoor The tables are limited but there are plenty of bench we can sit There were music performers who showcase their talents The food stalls were plenty Some are so popular the queue can take a while Its recommended for night out with family
8480,5,The architecture is simply amazing and mind blowing Theres a lot of space to sit around for a picnic so I suggest getting some beer and chips from a convenience stall and sitting down on the many small alfresco dining areas or the grass hill
8481,3,Near the fashion areas and large shopping malls this is a harmonious and curved architecture that can be seen from far
8482,4,I enjoyed walking the halls of the Design Plaza but I was expecting more art and less commercial space The exhibit space was nearly empty and very few staff were working in these areas  Most visitors were in the mall or restaurant area Very cool building and a great place to spend a few hours This place has huge potential and is a great addition to city culture
8483,4,You would have a hard time finding a more splendid building From the grassy roof to the curves that you want to touch this is a one of a kind place Walk about the grounds and just take it in After that wellthere is not much A art shop area was actually sort of a cheesy mall A coffee space while amazing with a huge interior barista area was largely empty of people and soul Other spaces just were not used leading to the question what is this building for Pretty but then what
8484,5,I love DDP Theres always something new and fresh to explore I feel creativity coming from every angle and love wandering around looking at the buildings and sculptures I love that theres a continuous change of exhibits and love the vibe of the whole area
8485,4,happen to drop by it is via Dongdaemun History  Culture Park subway line which i cannot remember now but it is nice to just wander around this area and visit the shops in the plaza  there is also a tourist centre downstairs where u can sign up for tours etc or simply take a brochure or two
8486,5,This place holds various exhibitions and fashion shows so it really depends on personal preference The last time I went was during its exhibition Quite a nice view except that the pictures didnt turn out good on my phone This is located at Dongdaemun History  Culture Park Station Seoul Subway Line 2 4 5 and Exit 1
8487,5,Come after dinner to see the lights and appreciate the architecture of the Design Plaza before heading to shopd which open all night Accessible by a couple of metro stops
8488,3,Yea if youre into architectures yea this is a must go place for you But if youre not into it DDP might only be a strolling place for yall BUT theres this LED flowers now and it looked really nice Of course its in Dongdaemun district so you can come here for a good stroll at night after you finish your day shopping Cause theres duty free shops and blah blah blah
8489,4,The structure of DDP is worth the visit There isnt much going on during the day but evenings are filled with street vendors that selling food souvenirs clothes etc The outside structure is very interesting with great architectural lines
8490,5,The architecture of this place was amazing It was beautiful inside and out We went in the afternoon and missed the lighting of the LED roses at night but even in the daytime those flowers were impressive especially the history behind them There were nice shops inside the actual building and even the kids enjoyed the place The surrounding area is a shoppers paradise although we didnt get to actually go inside those stores I would definitely explore this area more if I had more time
8491,5,Well worth going there to see beautiful modern architecture museums and interesting shopping places with stuff from local and international designers Nice open areas to hang around and chill out There is also a public piano if you want to entertain yourself or other people
8492,5,Impressed by the architectural design  simply out of this world with great accessibility to metro buses Its in the heart of Dongdaemun  the East gate shopping extravaganza
8493,4,Great piece of architecture and design if your lucky there may be an interesting exhibition on as well we got lucky with 30 years of pixar design shop is cool too Def one to see if you are a fan of architecture
8494,5,Seoul is city of design One of the most unusual design is Dongdaemun Design Plaza I love it inside and outside
8495,4,Interesting building with exhibits Lots of shopping nearby and there is a subway station at the plaza
8496,5,Worth the Visit when youre in Korea Been here for two times already and this place still amazed me
8497,5,Best to visit in the evening with changing and throbbing lights and all We did not bother entering as we were so tired from a days tour we just posed and took some selfies Next time well check the schedule of events
8498,4,The DDP is good for photoshooting and you can easily get an instagramworthy picture hereI went there at night and the DDP is just look like a UFO stations at Seoul city The lights on the DDP blinks slowly at night You can take a walk around DDP and enjoy the night view of Dongdaemun
8499,4,There are museum Exhibition center in the building you should check schedule before visiting After I had shopping near around Its very convenient to take subway there I love Seoul 
8500,3,The building is itself interesting to visit Small museum shop some shopping area Good to take a coffee at the garden or at the terrace
8501,5,DDP itself has nothing much but the exterior structure is amazing and surrounded by lotsa malls which means endless shopping
8502,5,This place is great to just wander around and explore The architecture is magnificent and lots of good photo opportunities There are also several picnic spots You can also visit the museums and exhibitions inside for a price  Very good for dates or if youre tired of shopping in Dongdaemun
8503,3,We went here with friends one night for a look see The buildings themselves are really cool architecture and the rose light garden is great to see but apart from that much of the buildings are still empty and the design part is not so obvious There is a good atmosphere in the precinct and opportunity for good food
8504,5,Artistic modern design it was really open my eyes must go place in Seoul  Then walk inside the culture park you will see the LED light roses fieldmain reason whats attract girls tourists to go there
8505,5,I was surprised to see this beautiful building And then I discovered that it was designed by Zaha Hadad the great engineer You can go around the build but I dont think there are much to see and to do inside
8506,4,This is my second visit here This time not on purpose as I went to see the night market but at night the Design Plaza looks very cool Probably best in the day if you want to have a bite to eat but at night visit it with other things in the area
8507,5,Highly futuristic architectural design and awesome place A must visit when in Seoul as it will leave a lasting memory for sure
8508,5,I have never seen anything like it From the outside it looks like a complex stadium or maybe even a spaceship Inside the spectacular designs continue with elaborate archways and fancy lighting  There is so much to see and do here from shopping to eating  I have visited this place twice mainly because my camera loves it here Make sure to put this one on your list if you are visiting Seoul
8509,5,The architecture was very impressive Its really an icon for art They held art exhibition regularly too
8510,4,Located in the Dongdaemun shopping district you couldnt help but be awestruck by the jawdropping architecture of DDP The gargantuan size of the building is simply too hard to miss as it totally dominates the Dongdaemun area It is even visible from the Seoul city wall nearby I must say that together with the 555m Lotte World Tower skyscraper these are truly Seouls modern iconic wonders
8511,5,An amazing building to see and walk through and around it is huge curved and has a scifi look we are sure there will be SciFi movie made there one day Just outside Dongdaemun station on Line 2 when you walk out of the station you encounter your first sight of this amazing building There is a cafe at one end of the building worth visiting and shops in other parts as well as a museum and large outdoor sets huge camera and old piano that you can play in the walkways If you have the time worth a visit and a possible look into the future
8512,5,You cannot help being mesmerised by this stunning structure which dominates the area You can marvel at the lines and its shear size Make time to see this spectacle from the mind of the infamous Zaha Hadid Can easily combine with a visit to Gwangjang market and a walk along the city stream Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful
8513,5,Spectacular designed building celebrates small new designs inside Travel up to 26th floor of the shopping plaza opposite to get a good view See the precinct at night to see the LED white roses at night and visit the museum at the back to see the history of the site
8514,3,Lots and lots and lots of shops Can be quite pricy for the local designers apparels pay for their quality
8515,2,Theres nothing special about this place If you pay extra for the special exhibition that you want to go then maybe its worth it Other than that its just the building Nothing else
8516,5,The DDP Dream Design PlayDongdaemun Design Plaza is humongous in its entirety Its also a great place for people who appreciate modern art and architecture as the DDP holds about 4 floors worth of exhibition space for lectures talks and other brand launches When we visited last week they were even hosting a launch for Louis Vuitton and Pixar Animation Even if you have nothing to do here the area itself is like a playground for the senses Everything was built to tower over you and it encloses you in this serene space away from the bustling city just a jump outside of its entrance There are places to sit floors to ascend and its connected to the subway proper so youll never get lost A lot of retail stores and restos beneath it were closed when we were there as a family but the ones that are open look cozy and modern without being too pretentious Plus this is a great place to linger because DDP is literally next to the busy Dongdaemun City center and crossing You can access Doota Mall or Migliore from here Doota is more expensive Migliore is cheaper for clothes and other goods  Great place to get lost in Would come again 
8517,4,Impressive and unusual architecture which needs to be viewed by walking around and in it Unfortunately we were unable to see the design exhibits due to lack of time but just walking around the building as it snakes around a vast are of land was an experience by itself Be sure to research where exactly you want to go as it truly is sprawling and information even from the staff may fall somewhat short of what you will need
8518,4,DDP is very attractive building with beautiful lightnings at night Its a nice place to walk around dont miss the artificial rose garden
8519,4,Modern architecture building with great landscape Outside is better than inside as the shops inside are a little disappointing Went to see the night LED roses landscape and totally worth it for the photo
8520,4,the building is beautiful but not quite sure whats inside this magnificent building but at least the exterior of the building and the historic park were amazing
8521,5,The place is vast and multi functional The architecture is stunning but discrete at the same time During Seoul fashion week it become the main spot
8522,4,The LED roses were really pretty at night thats the only reason I went there haha and there is a Kakao friend store too
8523,4,Nice building stunning architecture The building houses some small museums but I did not visit them Its located in a very nice area with lot of shops restaurants and foodstalls Also there is a market of such which sells everything from phonecases to socks and pots  pans
8524,5,We didnt plan well so ended up reaching here quite late and by that time we were tired as well Its a nice place with lots of activities for kids  So if you want to spend sometime with kidd doing done design workshops this is the place to go
8525,3,We found the area to be interesting and enjoyed the historical museum and the old wall The actual exhibits in the building werent of a much interest to us The staircase in the main building is amazing
8526,4,We go there in the evening so we can enjoy food truck and taking the photo with flower lights There many local vendor too
8527,4,Its a nice place to sit down and take a break from the shopping There is also a huge atrium inside where they sell many interesting household decorative stuffs The prices are very reasonable
8528,3,My opinion is that such buildings like this DDP as well as other buidlings by Zaha Hadid architecture need more space outside You need to have a better vision of the general buidling to get more impression take Baku Azerbaijan for example But here the buiding is stucked between other surrounding objects and you cant get the right feeling Anyway if you have never seen Zaha Hadid architecture  it is worth a visit surely At the same time I must mentioned really interesting designer shop here if I am not wrong it is called Designer Lab
8529,1,didnt see anything because you have to pay and not sure if it will be worth it to see do didnt end up seeing anything
8530,5,As dongdaemun is famous for its shopping area this plaza adds beauty to this place this plaza is also a fashion hub there fashion shows are held regularly
8531,5,Just seeing the building is impressive in itself The shops inside are pretty generic but just going to check out the architecture is worth it What a great piece of art
8532,4,Really glad I went to check out the famed architecture It really is quite stunning The Design Lab is also good Expect high end prices on quirky goods Lots of international representation so dont expect everything to be Made in Korea although there are enough local designers to make this a worthwhile destination for souvenir shopping if you have some money to spend Its not cheap  The structure is huge and perhaps the retailers were a bit overly optimistic about traffic volume The whole second level of design lab is closed kind of like an overly hopeful kid that planned a huge party and no one showed up  The coffee shop in A3chive has good coffee Not overly impressed with the sullen service by the twenty something crew BUT they made a good brew  Some fabulous sculptures outside so have a good walk around to take it all in
8533,3,Thought there would be more to this place There is a movie theatre and places to eat at the lower level but not sure it was what we expected Could have spent the time somewhere else
8534,4,Very nice and unique building in Seoul Near shopping center as well We went to this building because of the strange shape didnt really get into the building and explore
8535,5,I happened to visit this area during fashion week in March So much fun seeing all of the people dressed up wannabe models and photographers various food trucks and so many people
8536,4,We visited DDP on a tour The place is pretty cool if you are into funky and unique goods and souvenirs to take back For example they have a stall which can make 3D statues of yourself which are made of plastic using 70 cameras They also have goods by unique designers from overseas as well They venue is popular with local families
8537,3,Actual place is another 1km away We ended up taking another taxi ride to the actual place Google map would be a more actual representation
8538,5,Not being a fan of Museums well I thought this was one of them it surprised me it had shops restaurants and everything in between It even hosted food trucks Amazing  Well worth the visit
8539,3,Really nothing much Most people visit because it is near Dongdaemum and the building design is unique The shops within are just a waste of time in my view
8540,5,You cant missed this building if you shop around Dongdaemun The building structure is very special and big Take some time to explore the place Better to visit in the evening as the lights are beautiful
8541,3,It is worth of stepping out the metro for 10 min and taking a photo but not much more Exhibits and shops inside are boring and only interesting place is the black hole like tunnel they showcase on photos
8542,3,Happen to visit this area and still has some time Decide to walk over to take a look of this Silver Dome This is unique structure by itself in this tall buildings area It is ready huge building and think is the same idea as The Arc in Daegue
8543,5,DDP is close by to Dongdaemun market didnt think we will spend much time here but once we were here it was really quite something The Design Lab had many different stalls selling different artists unique crafts and gadgets We easily spent over an hour in there Worth visiting for all tourists
8544,5,Not only stunning from the outside the inside offers a huge range of museums and designer shops where you can find design gems from great young and talented designers
8545,3,I came here for the DDP night market The night market closes quite early My friends and i arrive there around 12 at night and almost shops are closed We didnt eat anything there Luckily we took some picture with the LED roses for 5 minutes Lights turned of very soon  Most importantly the MRT was no longer providing service since it is too late all the taxis are not willing to follow the meter a lot of taxi were waiting outside Doota but none of them willing took us Lastly I spent 20000W to Mapogu which is 50 off already Remember to bargin the price or leave before 12 amThis problem is the same in this district we didnt take the taxi in crowded area
8546,5,I have never seen so much shopping in my life There were hundreds of stalls and stores in the area You can buy wholesale and also by the peace Anything you need for a home or to wear is found here I purchased many items A must see
8547,5,I didnt get to go in but did enjoy this massive architecture from the outside I went up a department store to the 10th floor and got a birds eye view of it the building has a balcony See photo
8548,4,This is a beautiful building from all angles and when we visited there were some great stalls by local artists set up The shopping nearby is also well worth a look Plenty of restaurants nearby too
8549,5,First i saw this buliding so exited Its so unique like ufo building  I recommend you to go here at night because its more beautiful with led rose garden Light floor like tetris just wow to me can go here Its really modern Building Near with doota and other fashion market I just regret didnt get into this building Next trip i will explore all  Dont forget to come here when youre on dongdaemun area 
8550,4,It is not really a good place to shopbut a best place to see latest fashion if you love KPop It is quite expensive but a good place to stroll around
8551,5,This incredible space was design by starchitect Zaha Hadid the building hosts the Dongdaemun Design Plaza and exhibitions spaces occupying the landscape like a spaceship The entire space comes to life at night surrounded by a field of LED flowers The impresive building has a futuristic design and deserve a visit by any architecture lover
8552,5,I visited the plaza during winter where Fornasetti Practical Madness was featured as the artist The lovely architecture of the plaza was even more celebrated with the fusion of Fornasettis design pieces strategically positioned on every curve of the design plaza Want to come back for more
8553,4,Impressive design Nearby park where you can also take some pictures I was really impressed with the design of the building Was not able to visit the shops though will check them out next time
8554,4,We liked to walk around this place Lovely architecture The design lab inside of one of the buildings was not what we expected stores that sold some stuff We thought that it will be some kind of architectural design exhibition
8555,4,The DDP is worth a visit primarily to see this architectural masterpiece by Zaha Hadid the first woman to receive the Pritzker Architecture Prize I didnt find the shops particularly interesting but theyre worth a quick visit
8556,5,1 Main thing about this place is its cosmic architecture Spend some time and try to rich all points and layers of this gorgeous building 2 Two small museums and exhibition spaces Museums have free admission Admission for exibitions varies 3 Lot of small shops in Design Labs and Design Market Good place for gifts hunting Price range  mid and up 4 Very nice nursery room Beautiful garden on the roof
8557,4,Went there on a Monday and found out it was closed But decided to visit the design shop on the 2nd floor and found some nice unique boutiques Hope to return in the future to check out more
8558,4,New landmark of Seoul it was nice to be there really cool building DDP is the place for Seoul Fashion Week if you want to know that feeling being an model just go there and take some photos lol but inside the building you can find souvenir that very unique and cool desiged from young designer or famous designer of korea also you walk aroung DDP you gonna see LE Roses garden recommend to visit there at night really beautiful

8562,5,Designed by Zaha Hadid with neofuturistic design I admired this place so much photogenic spots to get picture or just relax with friends in the evening
8563,4,Went to this place one Sunday morning I had a good time just taking photos from the outside its quite big accessible via the train
8564,4,In short they call it DDP and it caught my eyes since we were crossing the street Luckily this place was just within walking distance from our hotel I prefer to stroll around DDP while my friends shopping at Dongdaemun Market and Doota Plaza This is such an architectural feast with its neofuturistic design it gets a lot better at night with the lights bouncing off the buildings I felt like I was walking into a spaceship A child in me is hoping to find some Star Trek  ish ornaments or some Vulcans around herejust kidding LOL  They have several museums and shops inside but I think the exterior was much more interesting Go around the exterior and enjoy the sculpture gardens all the way to the LED garden So much photographic spots to explore What a stylish way to spent an evening And the good thing is its all free of charge
8565,5,In the hectic Dongdaemun i loved spending time watching the architecture here Lots of good photo ops
8566,3,We recently spent an afternoon exploring the Dongdaemun area and found the design plaza truly amazing from an architectural standpoint It was a cold windy day but we highly enjoyed viewing the design plaza and the sculpture garden around it The shops and businesses inside are average We think seeing the exterior of the design plaza is much more interesting than the interior It was a fun place to cross off our to do list in Seoul
8567,5,It is nice designed building and there are small interesting shops inside You can buy unique goods there Also its neighbors are interesting such as shopping malls and nice restaurants
8568,4,It is one of the stylish places in Seoul Please check some exhibition in this place if any  some of them are very popular You can also approach many famous and inexpensive markets near this place
8569,4,We were just passing through the way and got a view of Dongdaemun design plaza Then we just could not put our eyes off the glitterati and beauty of this place at night and walked in It is a huge architectural wonder which has various art and design studios shopping places and restaurants It was fun watching the musical talent show going on outside which had a huge young and lively audience All in all it is a complete entertainment packageI would surely recommend this place
8570,4,It looks like a space ship to me and I like its cool design There is museum gift shops tourist info center inside it
8571,5,Great Architecture the Must to visit in Seoul for art and design fans Enjoy the fantastic space for photo shooting
8572,4,The design is great It was modern huge and very interesting A new place for gather  hangouts  and especially becouse the place become a spot for design and arts activities there are much you can do and gather from this place  Very interesting It also very close to mall where you can find foods and points of attractions This a place you can spends hours at it
8573,4,We visited the plaza after hours when the building was lit up and the retail shops were still open It is an architectural marvel and close to great shopping at Dongdaemon Market and Doota Mall
8574,5,an awesome work from the late Zaha Hadid Its timeless aside from the awesome shape check out how sunlight bounces off the building
8575,5,a super cool architectural building in dongdaemun the great spot for those who likes to take a picture cause in this shape are unique recomended for tourist and local people my advice go to this place at night cause the light are gorgeos D
8576,4,This is a huge building with modern design Worth the visit just to see the shape of the building There are shops on the ground floor
8577,4,Great design by Zaha Hadid easy to reach by metro and near to dongdaemun market and doota mall Great place to study on architecture detailing as im an architect too visually attractive and picturesque There is a mall downstairs and connected to metro station
8578,4,a super cool architectural building there are also lots of events you can visit inside Dont forget to visit the LED rose garden on day and night Its super beautiful
8579,4,If you are interested in Modern design structures that push the envelope then this is certainly worth a visit and walk round Lots of shops inside and a museum and there are cafes and snack carts outside
8580,4,Its pretty modern and cool place to spend an afternoon plenty of shopping to be done nearby and its right off the subway station
8581,3,Ive never been in the museum side but the design plaza is a unique little shopping area Ive bought some interesting things in here before and it might be worth a look around but I think if you are visiting Seoul that there are much more interesting and better places to go
8582,4,The 2nd time to me to go to DDP but for my big family is their first time they very exiting to see the beautiful and unique design of the building inside area beside museum there a lot of resto area
8583,5,It incredible futuristic architecture makes Seoul together with Tokyo great cities balancing the old and new The place is huge and deserves a few hours to be explored
8584,4,I visited here with my family of four including two young children The building has a unique architectural history and design for those who are interested Also there are several stores and direct access to the metro I wouldnt stop just to see this but one can visit in quickly in passing Enjoy
8585,4,Sweeping design contemporary lines open interior    a building that draws and maintains your attention as you explore its exterior and interior Rooftop garden angular spiraled stairwell and more The changing exhibitions inside vary from inspired to insipid Ive been here four times over a fouryear time period
8586,5,In this spaceship like building my kids got to ride the virtual roller coaster fee was very reasonable Theres also this one area that has 260 cameras that took a 360 degree picture of my daughter and my son From those pictures it created a 8 tall you select the size figurineaction figure and 2 weeks later it came in the mail to my home Its not perfect like a photo but it sure is really close My kids were hesitant to try but I told them that one day when they become my age itll be fun to show their kids what they looked like at age 15  17 I love it Its such a wonderful keepsake for me and one that my kids can treasure and admire in their latter years My kids were surprised at how much it really looked like them Across the street there is a multilevel maybe 8 stories shopping center that from the outside it looks like a department store but in the inside its actually an indoor market where each stall is independently owned and you can bargain with the price They also sell some knock off wallets and purses too
8587,5,We wandered into this place and were surprised to find all sorts of interesting stuff I particularly enjoyed the stores with modern design items that I had not seen elsewhere Some great travel gizmos
8588,5,Unique architecture A place to walk around Many good LED deco in the plaza LED rose garden is very nice too Worth a visit
8589,3,I really wanted to see the building itself It is quite amazing and defiantly something worth seeing We had a look through the design plaza and there were many cool items you could buy
8590,3,Interesting architecture with interesting sculptures scattered throughout the vicinity It was a nice surprise to find out that DDP sits on top of an archaeological site so there were some artifacts that you can view together with modern ones
8591,3,Magnificent building and worthwhile to visit However there is not enough signage for visitors to navigate around The led lighted flowers are beautiful to behold It was definitely a beautiful and challenging walk during the winter night
8592,4,unique shape of the buidingfeel like spaceship from under the roofhahawent inside and see the technologyvery impress
8593,5,This design plaza is designed by an Iranian Architect Located right on top of the subway line DDP station its such an amazing building The plaza itself is nothing to shout about with some restaurants and shops but the building futuristic design is the attraction Do visit the LED lights Flower garden besides the building Take some nice photos there You may adjourned to the surrounding malls for your retail therapy Dongdaemun area is fantastic for food and entertainment
8594,4,The DDP really is a wonderful piece of architecture and as a Zaha Hadid fan was a must on my to do list  Would highly recommend visiting at night as the whole place is illuminated and the lights sort of bounce of the building it really is beautiful and you can really appreciate the curvature of the design A plus with visiting at night is the flower light garden which is a fun walk and great photo opp  very romantic for date night  If youre heading the day chill with a drink int he middle and listen to people play on the piano check out lots of sculptures around the plaza or make a 3D model toy of yourselves  would recommend you go early in your trip for this  DDP was one of my favourite nights in Seoul and as a bonus you can walk across the road to Dongdaemun Market and Doota for 24hr shopping to make the most out of the night
8595,1,Ive no idea why other traveler like this From outside it looks really great  thats a fact But inside it is a joke Half of the building building belongs to conference center and in the other part you can visit normal exhibitions The design mall is of course a normal underground And totally disappointing was the fact that you cant find anything to do with design
8596,5,The building looks awesome from so many different angles There is additional artsy stuff to see inside the building The plaza itself has a lot of open space and sculpture type things In the surrounding area you can find lots of stores for shopping too The whole area is worth a visit
8597,5,This is one of the best masterpieces ever done by the superarchitect Zaha Hadid I visited Seoul over the years to witness its construction and the end result said it all Every nooks and crannies are simply sublime and yet they all fit in together and the layouts are in such a coherent manner too This Design Plaza is an internal Plaza thats providing a platform for local designers to showcase their ware There is a Museum Galleries when we were there there were presentations on Fornasetti and works from Smithsonian Institute cafes green area shops at the basement thats linking up to the subway station There are pianos being placed around the outside of the Plaza and so from time to time they might attract proficient pianists whose playing would imbue the environment with music that would elevate our aesthetic appreciation to yet another level All in all Design Plaza to me is magnificent and if theres one thing that you must do in Seoul make it this one
8598,4,Seoul is so modern and the architecture here reflects that well We had a great stroll around this area which was bustling with tourists Nice thing to do in and afternoon if you have it spare
8599,4,Another landmark one must go to It is not so impressive from afar but once you go to the plaza itself it is really impressive Of course having the shopping around the area adds to its attractiveness
8600,5,Oh yes This is a good place for street photography snack time dating time and much more Good and clothes store everywhere and you will be going home a a bunch a hand Love it
8601,4,Designed by Zaha Halem Great for photo taking The state of the art and futuristic building Love the rose garden Went there in the night the led roses are all lighted up In the mall there are design shops that sell creative design stuff via Dongdaemun History  Culture Park subway station We spend about an hour here
8602,5,Been here a couple times already Right by Dongdaemun History  Culture Park Station Exit 1 Such a modern architecture surrounded by other art exhibitions Lots of restaurants and shopping around Good area of Seoul to visit
8603,4,Love the unique architecture of this plaza which is in the heart of seoul It is located in dongdaemun and is within many malls
8604,5,This place is good for taking pictures If you need a place to take a picture with an incredible background this is the perfect place for you Especially during Seoul fashion week you can meet many attractive and fashionable models Sometimes there will be events here such as flea market and performance Theres also a lot of museum here and stores The stores here are relatively expensive than other places
8605,5,I visited this place with my sister who is an architect As an ordinary people who came as a tourist I found this place was really cool and had many sides you can take picture and enjoy the view As for my sister she really enjoyed her time admiring this building and its curvy design This place is really sophisticated but beautiful
8606,4,Stateoftheart design surely one of its kind Worth a visit if you appreciate architecture and unique building designs Never seen a plaza like that before very pretty sight Totally enjoyed the visit there
8607,5,Loved the lit LED roses thousands of them And the shops inside offers unique souvenir items that you can bring home with you
8608,5,It is a modern and amazed architesture and it is good for visitors to tour around this attraction day and night Also the park is very close to two different metro stations Dongdaemum and Dongdaemum History  Culture Park with walking distance to the old east gate of the city  Dongdaemum as well as Cheonggyecheon Stream
8609,4,Its unique design is an attraction Its nice to walk around the structure to appreciate the landscape at the other side of the building Spacious pathway for a big group of tourist
8610,4,Went here around sunset time Loved how the sunset was beaming against DDPs walls Can be a bit tiring on the way up if youre not into walking up a slope P Very accessible via Dongdaemun History  Culture Park subway station
8611,4,Shopping heaven but not many signboard for direction

8775,5, I dont like the jjamppong soup The price is not too expensive Its okay 
8776,3, A place where the impression is different when you still pay by card

8796,5,Huge market According to google qith over 10000 marketstands  There are a few streetfood stands with a nice variety
8797,3, I think Ill have to find out the price and buy it in several places Because its not a reconnaissance system the price is different for each household and there are many household owners who call it expensive and 
8798,5, It is a very good place with a lot of variety of goods and good quality items

8885,4,Fun place to walk around and shop Dedicated sections for clothing baby goods luggage camera shops etc I came for the kalguksu bibimbap alley and the grill fish alley There are red angels  tourist ambassadors in red uniform standing at major intersections for questions Great place to get a flavor of local culture
8886,3,Went here mainly to buy dried food such as the famous freeze dried strawberries and cuttlefish from Seoul Sanghwae The market also sells various trinkets such as jewelries Myeongdong is also a walk away
8887,4,My husband son and I visited Seoul South Korea for the very first time the end of January Our Hotel the Tmark Grand Hotel was within walking distance of the Namdaemun Market and we visited it numerous times over the course of the week we were there  Im not a big shopper but I am a foodie and we ate in a couple of restaurants in the Market as well as sampling some of the street foods and I also purchased some Honey Butter Almonds which are a very popular foodie souvenir to buy when in South Korea at a lower price than if you go to an actual shop that specializes in them of which there are MANY   I love Night Markets Coming from Canada I cant get enough of them when I visit Asia Everything looks so FOREIGN LOL I saw all manner of fresh fruits for sale spices clothing foodie treats and much much more  The Market which is the largest traditional Market in South Korea has over 10000 vendors retailers and wholesalers It is a dense maze of stalls and restaurants One night while we were looking for a spot to get some dinner we came out of a back alley to be faced with a stunning Old City Gate right across the street which turned out to be Sungnyemun Gate South Koreas 1 National Treasure You honestly never know what is going to be around the next corner  Merchants have been selling items near this location since 1414 AD There is an information booth with people in it that do speak some English which is super helpful They also have free maps so you can orient yourself We went to the Information booth one evening for a restaurant recommendation and were pleased  Just go wanderits uber fun
8888,5,Must visit Nice and busy market Get yourself a signature stamp facial masks sock and more socks and stuff Good food on the go as well plus a beer to keep your sanity Sops inside and outside Highly recommended
8889,3,Mostly shops and a lot are the same Lots of clothes socks bags etc Some streetfood Try the dumplings
8890,5,Cant find that one thing or forgot something  this is the market for everything and more You will love it  and never never bored but does get busy after 10 am
8891,2,It was supposed to be a treat day for the kids to go to the toys street but to our horror there were NO TOYS  Needless to say the kids were utterly disappointed  so were the adults
8892,5,A local market where you can find many shops selling souvenirs snacks and fashion It includes many streets with different zones Enjoy strolling along the streets
8893,3,If you live in a country where there is no big markets stalls like this then this may be an interesting place to visit
8894,4,The place was packed with stalls selling clothes food souvenirs They are lot cheaper than at Myeongdong The food is much on the street food options Try the egg bread or the hotteok
8895,3,Nothing special about this particular market probably a bit more exciting at night but none of the stores are particularly unique or interesting I am sure you can find more lively markets out there
8896,3,We came here thinking it would be more like the Myeongdong shopping area Its not terrible but just wasnt what we expected It is a great place to buy souvenirs for cheap
8897,5,Great place to shop Tons of people from different countries On the spot money exchange Yummy street food Shopping off the street and can readily bargain
8898,5,Went to numerous street markets in Seoul and the best bargain I would say is Namdaemun market Do take exit 5 once exit mrt so you will see the food before the shopping Manage to find a shop selling 14 pairs of socks for 10000 won After shopping around Namdaemun market you can walk over to lotte mart Seoul station which is about 1015 mins walk away
8899,4,Love this place cause it got everything I went in December and it was cold but not snowing but still my body couldnt stand the cold I got a jacket here which costed me less than i would have bought it somewhere else which i wore throughout my stay They ve got pans kitchenwares knickers jewelleries etc You got to go there to see for yourself For me it was worth the visit
8900,5,It is somewhat like dongdaemun But nearer to Myeongdong right beside Shinsegae department store We encountered snow whil shopping there Price of stuff are relatively similar to Myeongdong but higher than dongdaemun
8901,4,It is at Hoehyeon Station and not far from Myeongdong Rows and rows of alleys between shops where traders peddle all kinds of goods If you are on a budget and ran out of ideas what to buy to bring home a visit to this place will soon get you planning what you shall buy for whom  Do go in the morning as traders have this belief that securing the first sale early bringeth luck for the rest of the day urban legend but have the fun of bargaining for your loot All for a steal  And since you are already there do visit the underground mall as well
8902,4,This market is ideally located and can easily be found  It is long stretch of market stalls that would fit everyones liking Prices here are affordable compared to other markets ive been to in Seoul Vendors may not speak fluent English but will still accommodate every buyers inquiries
8903,2,I spent a week in Seoul about 3 years ago and would stop by this market to grab some freshly deep fried red bean buns etc for my morning walk up namsan park  Because I fly through ICN a number to times a year when I have a long enough layover would head into the city for a quick hike and revisit of the market  Have been quite disappointed the last 3 visits this year The same vendors that were friendly and smiling are no longer And have become short and abrupt  The first time I chalked it up to an off day We all have those But 3 times within 6 months dont think it is a coincidence anymore  I dont know if it is because they have become tired of tourists or something else But it leaves a bad impression and I wont go back  The young people who walk around as ambassadors of the market are still very friendly and helpful
8904,4,Namdaemun Market is the largest traditional market in Korea with shops selling various goods All products are sold at affordable prices Namdaemun Market sells a variety of clothes glasses kitchenware toys mountain gear fishing equipment stationery fine arts accessories hats carpets flowers ginseng and imported goods
8905,5,If you want to experience street food go on weekends day time The small roads are closed That is my findings while in Seoul in early Nov19 Landed on Saturday night Went to this lively marketplace on Sunday morning When returning on Wednesday the road is opened to vehicles and no more street stalls  I started my trip at Namdaemun subway exit 5 Right at the exit is a fruits and vegetable store that selling items at wholesale price At least the strawberries I bought there is way cheaper  sweet than in Myeongdong and all other areas Imagine 6000krw at Namdaemun vs 1200020000krw for a pack of 32 strawberries selling elsewhere  Walk down the streets and get the street food first Solely window shop down the street You will discovered the pricing of same things is getting cheaper when going deeper into the market
8906,5,This is my fourth years pilgrimage to Namdaemun markets multitude of food alleys before starting my ritual of bargain hunting I made sure to follow the aroma of grilled fish And oh what a marvel that was The egg souffle was amazingly light and on any given day there must be 4 different fish on offer No menu no fuss just find an empty stool and enjoy your lunch for less than 10 Heaven on earth
8907,4,Always enjoyed walking and bustling with the crowds for good food and shopping Namdaemun market just grows into me with her charm of eclectic mix of goods and awesome food choices
8908,4,This market was recommended by my hotel staff after I complained about the somehow expensive prices at the malls and it didnt disappoint Not only is it a good shopping experience but it is a good place to interact with the locals and offers a wide range of street food I totally enjoyed the experience
8909,2,Most people have said on the internet that you can shop here until the wee hours of the morning but be warned that vendors DO pack up at 8 or 9PM and then it becomes a dead zone I have tried going 4 times at night and this is the result it is best to go during the day
8910,4,1 40 minute wait in mid afternoon for savory vegetable hotteok located just across from Courtyard by Marriot NDM was worth it Greasy but oh so tasty Likened to Chinese Scallion pancake Nice  2 Shop for prescription glasses or sunnies in the many spectacle shops at the market Prices and styles are very competitive We settled on Polaris Spectacles shop where we found the English speaking Mr Kim to be very patient and attentive A pair of Varilux progressive lens which would have cost me SGD 350 back home cost just half the price here And it took just 4 working days to get them ready for me
8911,3,Came here at night and couldnt find the food alley I walked around everywhere and couldnt find it Finally got internet and found it was north of the market
8912,4,This place is worth looking at Especially the jewelry building with hundreds of small shops Anyways not really a place where I would go shopping
8913,5,I spent a couple of hours in Namdaemun Market There are numerous small shops there You can find many souvenirs and odds and ends there Dont forget to bargain The vendors wont be offended by this Remember this is not a food street It is a place for buyingselling stuff The prices are cheaper than those in more formal stores
8914,4,I came here during December 2018 to buy Christmas souvenirs for my nephews They have cute clothesBabies to adults Got a couple of nice shirts for my dad and family Its a nice market to experience shopping and sightseeing in Korea 
8915,5,A must visit for the food My partner tells me the shopping was overrated and expensive May aswell ship in the stores for better quality
8916,5,Hairtail alley is a must visit it was so good I went three times on a seven day trip Currency exchange rates are better here compared to myeongdong
8917,3,A very typical Seoul market with endless roads that can be confusing many shops selling the same things Worth going for the interesting cultural experiences and sensory stimulation
8918,4,Night market style arrangement but open day and night Can find anything is this market but u need to bargain
8919,5,Went for a stroll trough seoul and Ive stumbled on namdaemun market  It has great variety of food clothing and other appearal Its also Cheaprr too A plus thing is that they dont keep yelling at peopleprops
8920,4,Food clothing knock offs and everything else you could think of Fun to walk around and even with a lot of people youll feel safe
8921,4,Very colourful place to go lot of people food souvenirs and what ever you want to find and not that expensive
8922,4,This street is one of the busiest streets in Seoul You get to see a lot of clothes shops fruit shop candy shops and traditional sweet shops Its worth visiting the place if you dont have other things to do
8923,3,Looks mostly like any market anywhere in the world with some exaptions Nice to walk through but dont spend more then an hour tops
8924,3,nothing much to buy here all selling the same thing only one cart selling cheap souvenirs vs all the stores I checked out The seller can even give me a discount since I buy more souvenirs Bought 1 dress after I asked for a discount and fixed price for other stores for 1 cardigan and 1 shirt
8925,5,This area is well known and a must see Especially if you like a bargain or street food There are several adjoining streets and an interesting place to go at night Its also not too far to walk for Myoungdong night market
8926,5,I learned that this was the place to come for eyewearIt is full of shops selling frames from around the worldI found a pair of Grriffi frames and AnneValentin framesboth at a very nice savings You can give the shop your glasses and they can make the prescription for you but I opted to have that done back home where it could be adjusted if there was a problem Not all shops are created equalshop around before you decide I visited all of the big Seoul street marketsbut enjoyed this one for all the local residents using it Lots of souvenirs were here from China just like the other markets but there were huge multifloor buildings filled with everything imaginable and with widely varied quality I loved poking around and watching local buyers and sellers visit A great place to lose yourself in the hustle and bustleIF you have time
8927,3,It is a large market and had everything one might want to purchase and some that you would not want to buy It had some atmosphere but it was still just a market The streets serving food had more character and interest
8928,5,Everything you could want from Korea is availableat this market Hundreds of outside vendors selling food clothes trinkets and so much more If you are in Seoul you must go to this market
8929,4,We walked this market a few times while we were in Seoul Many vendors and stores offering overwhelmingly beauty supplies sneakers and food etc Name it you can find it there We spent about an hour here the first time and kept going back We purchased a few souvenirs teas and makeup mask at very reasonable price
8930,4,Namdaemun Market Namdaemun Market is in the vicinity of Myeongdong Market A conventional shopping hub where one could buy from an assortment of goods ranging from food sports wear bags clothing textilesginseng accessories cosmetics kitchenwareWho knows one could strike a bargain or get a great discount A must visit
8931,4,Im always drawn to local farmers markets and this was that although so much more There are fish vendors steamed pork bun vendors which were amazing clothing stalls LOTS of clothing stalls drugstores spice vendors handbags cooking utensil shops confectionaries art supplies It seems like every turn you take youll find something a little unexpected  For instance the art supply store it was about the size of my bathroom at home yet it was packed with all sorts of things  canvases paints paintbrushes at VERY reasonable prices In fact good quality oil paints at cheaper prices than I can get in the states Ditto for spices And Kbeauty stores  I watched a woman make udon noodles from scratch and a man filet some fish It was a fun experience that could be as short as a half hour or a half day trip  Im definitely glad that we went and I would assuredly go back Its a great place to find authentic gifts to bring home but a terrific place to people watch
8932,5,If you are looking for tourist gifts then I would definitely start here before venturing out to the more popular street markets as I found some great bargains here  Of course they do sell similar items but its also a place where the locals mingle with all the tourist so its a great place to people watch definitely worth trying out some of the food stores too I got some fried doughnuts and they were yummy
8933,5,Most shops are clothing but this place is pretty big with several blocks of streets and alleys Along with basements and multi floors of stores after stores  From my group lots of ladies bought many skin care product souvenirs and food here
8934,5,There is much to see here At first I was not interested as I had been to another market and I didnt really know why I would want to explore more stalls and why I would need numerous inexpensive trinkets Still I kept walking and the next thing you know I was very interested in the market Its interesting to see coffee shops run by a single person tucked between perhaps a little jewelry stand and a store selling hats You will see all types of products from leather jackets to 3 earrings You will find all types of fried foods being prepared right before your eyes Well find a complete alleyway of nothing but restaurants Other food kiosks are scattered about On one side of the market is fronted by quite a few camera shops and I even bought a lens Well I guess that says I was having a pretty good time
8935,5,Loved the market One can easily spend half a day window shopping or shopping and trying out some street food Pity that we got to spend only a couple of hours there since we were specifically looking for luggage Would have loved to browse through the shops much longer and walk around Definitely go there while visiting Seoul Price wise I did not see any great deals some shops are open to bargaining and some are not Nothing was really marked down Nevertheless a great place to browse and look at things that you do not need 
8936,4,I spent half a day to visit this market and I didnt finish my tour Its absolutely huge youd get lost inside it I was a little bit disappointed about the clothing and jewellery not good quality and they all look like each others Much better is the food Actually I didnt try anything but the smell was so delicious that you can bet it was something really traditional and tipical of that place All inside the market there are many of these street food places and you have the opportunity to try different dishes for a low price For sure it is very contaminated by tourism and it has probably lost most of its characteristic atmosphere Anyway I enjoyed my visit there I only wished to have had more time to explore it better
8937,3,The Namdaemun market starts just from the Namdaemun Gate Sungnyemun Gate Its a pretty big market with food clothings accessories beauty products electronic stuff fake goods and many others but forget the SouthEast Asia market Prices arent so cheap as people may think I expected more
8938,5,Love taking souvenirs home and sharing it with family and friends but on a tight budget Namdaemun Market got your back They have tons of different souvenirs to choose from such as kitchenwares clothings for adults and kids stationeries accessories to beauty products and more They also have food alleys thats definitely budgetfriendly  Another thing that I love here is that the tourist information people are everywhere They have englishspeaking personnel and other language experts that you can talk to and ask about directions and all Theyre easy to find since theyre wearing red uniforms and hold placards  VERY TOURISTFRIENDLY
8939,5,So there is the day time shopping and night time shopping If your looking for kids clothes you can come after 10pm to 5am On 6 you can find many kids clothing stores The key to getting a discount is buy more than one piece I think the minimum is 3 and up So we bought on this trip maybe 9 of the same kids sleep sack different colors and sizes to give to friends and it was much cheaper For example a kids hat I bought was 15000won each but if I buy more than 3 its 9000won If I buy three I save 3000won and get 3 hats Anyway this is the deal and for accessories you need to buy by the dozens and many styles The last time I came I bought hairpins for my kids and friends They come out to 50cents each very cheap There is usually less people at night and this is when the wholesale customers come so just be aware to get deals you must buy more Also make sure you bring cash This also helps since most money exchanges close before 10pm Good luck shopping
8940,3,A good place to walk around as it is a big market which sells a variety of things from food to clothes to Kitchen utensil However encountered some unpleasant experience with some store owners Who only focused their attention to Japanese tourist Where I was in the midst of considering to make a purchase and a group of Japanese came along the store owners just left me abruptly and attended to the Japanese
8941,4,If youre looking for a cheap souvenirs or even snacks like in LOTTE mart you can go here You also can find some traditional snacks in the evening
8942,4,The market covers several blocks of the city and just about anything can be bought here Not really a tourist market much more a real market There are several good cheap eating places tucked away in the alleys Many of the establishments have pictures to help choose your food Good location for cheap eats
8943,5,There are two main shopping districts in Seoul for buying bulk items Namdaemun and Dondaemun Youll find a lot of what youre looking for in Namdaemun plus youll find plenty of places to feast your palate and stop for a drink after shopping A must see place while youre in Seoul Its a short walk from the subway where you can go anywhere in Seoul
8944,3,It was really difficult to buy anything as there were too many shops Most of the shops sell very similar things from clothing to souvenirs There malls are tightly packed with stalls selling yet again similar things Also the fashion was more suitable for the older generation Food was a let down here The interesting was the guards from Deoksugung patrol here daily
8945,5,We visited Seoul again after few yrs back in 20172016  2012 via SingaporeWe went to Namdaemun market few times whenever we were in seoul and there are many things here  have many choices to choose especially a shopholic like me  This year our second homestay located near to Namdaemun gate 5 and we love walking just across it
8946,4,Namdaemun Market is a good place for local food and other traditional custom It opens up to midnight
8947,5,Enjoyed so much more than Insadong market because it was more authentic and less typical retail Many products were the same Allow at least 2 hours Enjoy
8948,2,Big market selling lots of souvenirs and cheap wares Plenty of food stalls to try but avoid the alley restaurants displaying their wax dishes and calling you in  we tried one and the dishes that arrived looked nothing like what was advertised tasteless and we got only half the dumplings displayed for the same price  was then told the front displays were samples only Then they pretended they didnt know what to do with a credit card  asking for cash  when theres their machine right there and finally put it through on the card to give us a proper receipt Really dodgy
8949,4,We bought some magnet souvenir and keychain here We ask the information and they were very friendly We loves the souvenirs Overall Namdaemun Market is very good place to buy souvenir
8950,5,I love this Energetic Market so much There is lot of popular street food shop in local Mandu  Kalguksu HotteokFresh fruit Juice
8951,3,Huge market south of Sungnyemum Gate Visited on Sunday afternoon Appeared less vibrant than Myeongdong I had visited Saturday afternoon and didnt have the food stalls But prices were cheaper unless I didnt bargain hard enough at Myeongdong Worth an hour or two if you are wanting to shop good for souvenirs
8952,5,Great place to shop for souvenirs Go in the morning because its quite happening Buy souvenirs here as it is quite cheap compare to other places
8953,4,Quaint it aint Namdaemun Market is huge Not just a rabbit warren of streets selling everything you can imagine from kitchenware to clothing from bags to braised pig knuckles there are numerous warehousesized buildings to explore To get a good deal you need to bargain
8954,4,Its a Traditional market with food and souvenirs Kids clothing matured ladies clothing lots lots products very cheap price if compare the underground street Walking distance from Mengdong Suggest to go at day time shops will close at night
8955,2,We visited in the afternoon and there were lots and lots of stores that sell similar stuff They sell clothes shoes souvenirs kpop merchandise the prices were more or less the same but some were cheaper We did not spend much time there though since the place did not look appealing it may have looked more alive at night and it is easy to get lost If you want to shop for souvenir this could be a good place to go
8956,3,Much talked about this site thus the need to venture it Indeed there are lots of shopsstores to venture but it was not my forte as I dont really like crowded area and confusing lanes Maybe I am not prepared for it However we did some shopping here and as soon as we are done we took off No doubts there are loads of stuff selling here Some might enjoy it thou
8957,3,This is the oldest and largest traditional market in Korea It is spread out over many blocks with about 10000 vendors Nowhere else in Korea can you find such an array of items It was an interesting place to wander through even without buying anything And its named for the Namdaemun South Gate nearby which I visited also while in this area
8958,3,The amount of shops were lesser and less touristy as compared to Myeongdong There were I think more food stalls though
8959,1,Majority of the clothings sold are very dated Good for shopping of children clothings but not adult Some vendors there are pretty unfriendly too Pricing of souveniers are either the same or higher than what you can find at express bus terminal shopping area I would suggest not to waste your time to make a trip here  Yes there are many stalls there but if you are looking to buy clothings 95 of the shops are selling extremely dated clothings after taking out food  beverage stalls only 2 are worth a look but pricing is higher than what you can get elsewhere Truely a total waste of time
8960,3,There were some good bits to visiting Namdaemun markets  We didnt see the deep fried baby crab anywhere else and the dumplings were excellent The busy hot and narrow food alleys with kitchens along the walkways were a sight to see if not too enticing to eat at Nevertheless I thought the Gwangjang Market had much better food quality and variety and the Myeongdong street stalls had much more atmosphere in the evening so if you were time pressed Id do these first
8961,4,Namdaemun Market is quite a large place selling a variety of products  clothing bags food etc If you want something cheap best come here instead of going to the department stores Also lots of places to sit down and have a coffee or snack
8962,1,Nothing much to see or buy Within 10 minutes we left the place for good Will recommend if you are interested for photo taking
8963,4,This busy market is a great place to get souvenirs and really anything you could possibly need Grad something on a stick to eat and wander round
8964,4,We happened on Namdaemun market by chance on our first night in Seoul and wandered up and down the stalls which varied from the mundane cheap teashirts and nicknacks to the fascinating  preserved ginseng roots and pigs trotters There were several street food stalls including one stall with delicious dumplings and soft pork rolls  Small lanes run off to the left and right lined with small shops and stalls Whilst there were a few tourists like ourselves we were outnumbered by locals Well worth exploring
8965,1,Went during lunch hour under the hot mid day sun The market in general is covered but the stores are quite cramped and it gets pretty heated Was looking for the counter seats eating area like in Gwangjang Market but walked a few rounds and still cannot find it Ended up in some mediocre Korea restaurant that sells a range of Korea food So they say jack of all trade master of none the food was not fantastic and they expect one main dish per pax If you are there please walk into a small alley which u see ppl queueing for grilled fish and steam egg May be a better choice for authentic Korea food
8966,3,OK Market full of tat If you like fake supreme stuff you will be in heaven Some OK street food but otherwise Id skip this bit of town
8967,3,Very crowded market with lots of different shops selling the exact same stuff as all the other markets They seem to have a high demand on phone cases in this country We had very nice heotteok here
8968,3,I love Namdaemun more than Myeongdong because the goods and the foods here are cheaper But the market is a traditional one so its a little bit dirty and crowded
8969,2,I didnt particularly care for this market Too much cheap stuff in jam packed spaces and hoards of people People rummaging through clothes scattered across tables cheap knock off handbags teeshirts etc I did enjoy delicious bibimbap at a small restaurant nestled just beyond the cinnamon donut street food vendor A lovely owner who stirred my food for me and was so very kind I preferred Myeongdong neat LOTTE and Dongdaemun neat JW Marriott and Doota
8970,4,Typical Asian market Very nice to visit and get an impression of how people live eat and dress Every time we are in Seoul we visit this place
8971,4,This market is worth a visit Many curious things are traded here For example there is s shop that sells gift packaging materials so if you are looking for a special wrapping for a gift this is the place
8972,4,Remember this is not the Galleria Mall herewe are talking huge quantities of cheap mass produced items They have clothing furs  suitcases food massive food market starts at 400 Look for the candy vendor that makes candy from cornstarch They insert a filling that tastes like a snickers No kidding Easy to take home and they last for weeks Good for GF folks
8973,1,Went there for street food but it is almost inexistant and scattered all around the huge market If you are after something similar to markets in Thailand this is not the place
8974,4,Enjoyed the street food Deep fried baby crabs especially The shopping is not very interesting but still worth looking at A good place to find very local food
8975,5,This is a great market to visit although very very busy It was very interesting walking around looking at all the stuff people sell
8976,3,Saw a myriad of stalls and large numbers of shoppers but was disappointed by what seemed to be quite average items being sold
8977,4,Its a great market just be prepared to do a little digging Found good deals on shirts scarves every day use kinds of items
8978,5,I visited Namdaemun I could feel the traditional market of Seoul The grilled fish restaurant inside Namdaemun was delicious I recommend it It was nice to walk to Myeongdong after eating at Namdaemun restaurant
8979,5,its a good place to buy some item for giftits cheap and all items is thereyou just need to keep looking for it
8980,3,Food and clothing stalls in the middle of the road and stores along the street Place for cheap clothes and local food
8981,5,This Market was very close to my hotel so I went down several times in the evening Lots of street food on offer it is very vibrant with lots of different people sending different types of things from pot scrubbers to jeans to three piece suites and more Very interesting experience well worth a look
8982,3,I believe this place is cheaper than Myeongdong but not as interesting You can go here if you want to shop at a really low price We were able to buy a lot from here and most of our souvenirs came from this market
8983,4,Namdaemun Market is a must when visiting Seoul Nighttime visit is a lot better than during the day My wife always finds several things to buy every time we visit Remember where the restrooms are sometimes they are hard to find Tourist information teams can be found throughout the market They will be dressed in all red They have free maps of Seoul and the market in English No need to dress up for the visit  My favorite are steamed pigs feet The vendor will a small bag containing onions sometimes garlic and one or two other items that compliment the feet I always get a couple to take back to the hotel room  Recommend wearing of tennis shoes because you will definitely be doing some walking
8984,5,This is one of the largest traditional outdoor market in the middle of Seoul Varieties of foods and goods are endless here Love tasting some quick snacks from street vendors location in central part of the market alley It still retains its charms from bygone era of shopping from old time
8985,4,Lots of fun with so many different shops Dont miss out on the socks So many choices A fun environment
8986,4,We visited Namdaemun Market right as the sun went down so Im not sure if some of the stores were getting ready to close for the night but we still found some awesome deals My friend bought a cute winter jacket for 5 We bought some toddler hanboks for W35000 which is pretty reasonable
8987,4,We stayed in Tmark Grand Hotel just opposite this market and my wife went crazy shopping in here for clothes for our daughter so many stalls to choose from so many new and stylish clothes for our kid Bring lots of cash or stick to a budget try getting some discount and it works sometimes  In the evenings there are many food stalls selling all kinds of snacks so you will never go hungry
8988,4,Do go to the information booth to get a map of the place first so that you can plan which section to explore Good for buying cheap clothes currency exchange with attractive rates We came here to buy childrens clothing
8989,3,Namdaemun is a shopping area which is overwhelming While it is conveniently located and shops are inside airconditioned buildings seeing so many stalls one after the after from one floor to the other can be overwhelming But the goods sold are definitely cheaper and you could probably find some good bargains
8990,5,Youre looking for souvenirs local items made in Korea Namdaemun market is the place I bought some of their local snacks like dried fruits and vegetables sweet potato chips and many other kinds of flavour We got free bag of mix veggies and fruits chips for each item I bought great deal Namdaemun is one station away from Myeongdong
8991,5,This place full of cheap stuff such as souvenirs clothes etc And sometimes the seller will give you some bonus Theres a lot of street food too
8992,5,Im not sure if anyone knows how many stalls there are in Namdaemun Market The street food stalls are interesting and its worth trying a few to get into the spirit of things They have a fried pancake which is then stuffed with either meat or vegetables that is absolutely delicious The steamed dumplings with either pork or kimchi stuffing are also very good
8993,2,Not necessary to visit this place So many better places to go This market is filled with cheap tshirt and hair accessories knock off bags etc Nothing that you would go to Seoul for If you do feel you need to go be sure to go down some of the smaller alleys as those are better than the main streets Some good food stalls in the small alleys at least
8994,1,Place to shop for souvineers and snacks Variety street food fishcake lobster tail waffle ice cream and more
8995,4,Prices dont get any lower in Nandaemun market Traditionally they cater for wholesale but some do entertain tourist buyers  Be prepared to use sign language as many dont speak English and jostle a bit as the alley can be quite narrow and cramp
8996,3,I visited this place to find a special vintage camera therere lots of stores for that purpose near the Sungnyemun Gate The market itself is rather messy lots of chinese products of all kind No good souvenirs or fashion clothes Theres a tourist info desk ot far from subway gate 5
8997,4,It is a good experience here to shop at the open air market for a variety of items such as food and clothings There are also plenty of wholesale shops here but they cater only to businesses and does not sell to individuals You will need time to go into the alleys to explore the variety of shops that sells household items and many other types of things Namdaemun market is said to be the largest in Korea
8998,5,There are a lot of bargain souvenirs street foods pricey and cheap goods 1 station from myeongdong stationmany choices on different items
8999,5,Like any market  a great place to find soooo many great treasures A lot of people in the Market and so many ways to travel within the market but there are info booths to help you out and also people in red jackets in the intersection areas to help you  And dont for get to ask for a deal A great place to buy souvenirs Oh and you have to try the homemade dumpling booth  there are a few but see the pictures for the one we went to Absolutely delicious
9000,5,This open air market was across the street from our hotel and is mostly hidden through many lane ways  its amazing that from street side you wouldnt know how much market is there until you start walking through it Lots of good vendors but this market mostly clothes Its a must on your list On a side note the currency exchange in this market have the best exchange rates all very good and clean
9001,5,Anything you can buy asking interpretation staffs who walk around the market for visitorsforeigners help if you need their kind service as free of charge
9002,3,This market is positively rated in most guide books From my point of view its a bit overrated Its almost the same in such markets in Asiacolourful noisy overcrowded
9003,5,What a fun outdoor market You can find anything in the market and its a lot of fun looking and haggling It is easy access via subway lots of great places to eat and lots of cheap stuff to see and buy
9004,5,not a bad market to visit basically sell lots of clothing and the street food here are cheap clothes are quite cheap too
9005,5,Weekday night is not too crowded and going here before getting dark is also a good idea to avoid the crowd  Try the local street foods of Namdaemun
9006,5,Woke up in the early hours looking for some noodle in the area Came across a small food area in Namdaemun Market that offers hand cut noodles So yumm Approx 5000 won
9007,5,Namdaemun is very famous for its cheap and affordable price if you want to do shopping They sell clothesshoessocks and many more
9008,2,This was supposed to be an old established night market of Seoul However we found it quite deserted with few stalls  Our disappointment was saved some what by nice pork knuckle sold by a small Chinese restaurant located within the market
9009,5,Ginseng everywhere  If you want to see a real authentic market do not hesitate to visit it Recommended
9010,4,Although I didnt buy anything there its a great experience to browse the different items for sale As I was walking around I found the dumpling people are talking about in Tripadvisor I bought all types of dumpling to tryyummy If you eat there you can help yourself with the danmuji  yellow pickled radish which are placed beside the stall There are no chairs and you have to stand and eat Along the lanes are small restaurants If you are adventurous you can go in and try the local food If you stay in Myeongdong shopping area you can walk to Namdaemun market  less than 900 meters
9011,4,A perfect place to buy souvenirs with bargainable price So many items to look at Huge area and requires lots of walking Must try to famous food stalls
9012,5,Some stores are closed on Sunday But most of them are open everyday crowd starts to fill the market around 9am Mostly dry goods and preserved food There are small restaurants nearby Your \20000 can buy a lot of souvenirs
9013,3,This is the place to find cheap souvenirs We had a good tour around the market we spent some time here browsing for nice souvenirs They sell so much stuffs here Clothing accessories footwear snacks food We did not try any of the food there though some of them had Halal signs Some sellers speak Bahasa Malaysia Just a few Malay words Interesting We went there just to find souvenirs There are other places you all should check out if you want to buy fashionable clothes shoes cosmetic products
9014,5,This is the opposite for the fancy and expensive shopping streets Lots of little stalls selling all sorts of stuff in cheap prices Couple of interesting food vendors as well Nice to look around 
9015,3,We went for the night market the only thing that attracted me is the local food restaurant street Recommended Pepper beef soup with rice and bimbibab Skip Kimchi Fried Rice

9017,4,Cool market Not the modern market but the old school market selling both new and old school stuff Lots of stuff to see and experience Overall a nice experience
9018,4,start early look for lengdang building for brooches and all the ladies bling bling accessories the street are narrows and crowded with shops and shoppers best place to change foreign currency
9019,5,A must visit place in Seoul this market is the largest one in Seoul covering over 16 acres There is very thing here be it cloths toys stationary or street food and a best place to buy Souvenirs for your near and dear ones There are lot of shops specializing in selling refurbished cameras and accessories If you are buying anything be ready to use your bargaining skills And if you do not want to do any shopping it is still worth visiting here
9020,5,I am totally amazed by the changes through the years at Namdaemun  In fact Namdaemun is never my top option to visit But I have changed my mind since after experiencing the changes which took place  Neater and easier to walk around with less grouchy vendors More signs for tourists to locate different zones and with helpful guides in uniform around who speak several languages to assist with maps given  Various yummy authentic food available at reasonable prices such as Hairtail Alley which is a must try  Lovely easy connection to Seoullo7017 the pedestrians walkway from Namdaemun after all the feastingeasy going walk
9021,5,Wholesale market for costume jewelryclothingperserved item and a lot more to mentionedI even bought raw ginseng from here from an old couple who runs a small shopShould try their abalone porridge and red bean porridgeThumbs up yummy 
9022,5,This is the best place to go for souvenirs and street food because it is much cheaper and less crowded than Myeongdong or other famous shopping places in Seoul
9023,5,Come here if you want cheap gifts tshirts fridge magnets key chains etc If you are into accessories head to eLengdang 2nd floor This is a heaven for accessories
9024,2,Be careful where you eat my daughter got a bad stomach here She ate the round patty with vegetables inside Try and eat the street food that is made freshly in front of you
9025,4,Went there by bus number 3 from Namsan Seoul Tower 6 stops only Quite a big market as went during winter month of December too cold to stay too long Have good kimchi buns fish cakes soups  food Valley with seatings to eat in comfort Many shops to see can bargain a little if buy more Not all welcome bargains
9026,4,When you start walking into the market for those who have been to Bangkok Chatuchak market there is a sense of deja vu This place similarly has different section for clothing accessories etc You must look for their food alley which serve very local food Compared to BKK this market is slightly more spacious so one wont feel as claustrophobic
9027,4,We happened across this market while searching for a restaurant It was a fascinating place to wander
9028,4,Thoroughly enjoyed strolling around this area and we bought some lovely souvenirs at the handicraft center From crane bird boxes to Korea fridge magnets and chopstickholders  Did not yet find a great place to eat local food but well try again tomorrow
9029,3,Actually a typical local market that people here to look for bargain Sometime you may not get a good bargain either as you must know how to bargain Lots of clothing shoes food and food stuff Nothing special but is enjoyable to walk around and enjoy the atmosphere One of the stall that selling the hot steam bun is really good Long queue and prepare to wait for your food
9030,2,I read about good review of Namdaemun Market But for me as a shopper for good value stuff this place is not great Yes plenty of shops and many many choices But its mainly for reseller I stopped by one of the store and wanted to find out the price The sales lady asked me if Im a seller I gave up and walked away
9031,5,I knew I wanted to spend the day at one of the famous markets they are so fun loud interesting and you get a true sense of the culture from meeting the street vendors and trying all the exotic dishes This market in particular I was told is the biggest one in all of Seoul my friends and I spent nearly five hours there and feel like I barely covered a small section
9032,5,There is nothing you can not find in the market It extends for blocks on end Street vendor food is great especially the hoteok and there is lots to buy and bargaining is part of the fun
9033,4,We arrived in the early evening on a Monday and noted that some of the shops on the peripheral were selling produce that locals were buying Walking along the vibrant streets in Namdaemun Market you will see many shops selling souvenirs clothing etc as well as street stalls selling local food Worth a visit to see a street market in Seoul
9034,2,i wanted a place to buy traditional foodstuff like ginseng mushrooms and fruit This was a mistake I should have gone to the one at Jegidong when I last visited 3 years ago This one though nearer the city sold mainly expensive fake toys and clothes It is massive with many gates but each selling similar products A total waste of time
9035,5,Cheaper souvenir and more choices From keychain mirror pen shirts and many more Compare to Myeongdong Market Can find halal Kebab within walking distance from the Namdaemun train
9036,5,The place where one could buy cheaper souvenirs than elsewhere Grab anything that is cheap here as I regret for not buying much from here
9037,4,Went on a Sunday late morning  Seems like some of the alleys are not opened An alley called the accessories alley is totally quiet and empty the pushcarts are all covered up and the shops are not opened However the Main Street is busy with all the food stalls selling the different local food items Many of the pushcarts are selling the same items but some are more patronised than others Even if you dun know how to ordereat just observe the locals and follow what they do  Besides food there are many stalls selling imitation branded stuff Some are such bad fakes the words Tommy Hilfiger printed on a hoodie with another Brands logo Reminds me of night markets in Bangkok  Have yet to explore the Kulguksu lane and the fish lane but both looked busy
9038,5,I love this market lots of good food Things to buy for soveniers and nicely located near the metro Hyeon exit 4 and 5 You wont go wrong in coming here There are guides to help you around if you are lost Love it so much that I even came for a last walk on my day of flying off before I checked out from my guesthouse Wonderful place
9039,4,I went in the morning when the shops and stalls were just opening and it wasnt too busy Id recommend in the late afternoon and at night when its crowded and hustle bustle It would add to the atmosphere and excitement of the huge market  The market seemed to be orderly with womens clothing grouped together electronics all in one area childrens items in one area etc So there is some order to the market  I recommend just wandering down the allies and exploring without a plan Please keep in mind there is no English to be found so bring your guide map There were 2 young girls wearing red information vests who spoke wonderful English to your destination and provide you maps  Definitely go to this market Theres a great feeling here and you can pick up anything and everything you could possibly think of and need
9040,5,Great place if you are a foodie and love to explore local food at its simplest Plenty of choices to eat tasty and inexpensive specialties for which the best recommendation is the fact that locals really do eat here And once you filled up your belly you can dive into shopping of food and other goods souvenirs as Namdeaemun is not only a food place
9041,5,If you enjoy a bazaar atmosphere this is for you Indoors and passageways full of men women and children wear custom jewelery items for the house you name it is here Even several Christmas shops There are wholesale only shops among the offerings but they will tell you if you happen to walk in one Plenty of food stalls to maintain the energy
9042,5,I stayed near this traditional market during a recent visit to Seoul and visited three times Huge the place has eight numbered gates; more than 10000 stores in buildings and stalls; merchandise ranging from flowers to military equipment; and food carts It seems to be the liveliest in the morning when I encountered thick crowds and rather quiet in the late afternoon The market obviously attracts shoppers based on the transactions I saw taking place but also visitors with cameras soaking up the atmosphere and enjoying photo ops  I went for the atmosphere but ended up returning to seek out inexpensive souvenirs such as bookmarks and fans Though I looked at other items including clothing and accessories nothing appealed Much better quality can be found in nearby department stores but with higher prices  My favorite part of the market proved to be the ubiquitous food carts where vendors prepare all kinds of yummylooking fare I finally got in a long line waiting for a hotteok deepfried veggie pancake by Gate 2 It took about 20 minutes before I could put my order in and I received the hotteok almost immediately The cost was 1000 KRW about 1 US I stood on the street eating this tasty delight and savoring every bite  It is easy to get lost in this complex of pedestrian streets and buildings so I suggest getting a map from the markets information kiosk before starting to explore Enter from Gate 2 at Namdaemunro or Gate 5 at Toegyero The kiosk stands on the street that connects the two gates near the souvenir shops  Namdaemun Market is easily accessed by subway lines 1 2 4 and many bus lines It takes about 15 minutes to walk there from Seoul Station
9043,4,Are you hungry Theres a variety of things to eat  Do you prefer to shop Dont worry Namdaemuns got you covered  Do you just want to see new and exciting things Well what are you waiting for  go to Namdaemun  Even if you dont want to spend money I would highly recommend still going to experience the atmosphere of a traditional market There are people everywhere shop owners are shouting about the items they are selling to those who might be interested and deliverymen are swerving in and out of the crowds  Also side note  please go eat the Hotteok here IT IS DIVINE AND AMAZING Especially when the weather is cold
9044,5,This market is packed with many locals and tourists There is an assortment of food and drink both restaurants and street food fresh produce garments and clothes and many others  There is a portion with many stores selling all sorts of cheap accessories and raw materials to make accessories and embelishments
9045,4,we went there on our last day and regreted wish we had more time going around the maze of shops and locals do their shopping here too prices are about 5 cheaper compare to Myeongdong or underground mall good for nice bags and some local eats be sure to come with a suitcase and an empty stomack and ya there will be a few tour guides in red ready to help they have various language available
9046,5,There are many kinds of food  There is a shop selling hot steaming buns  Their original ones taste fantastic prefer the original to kimchi one First time trying out the pigs leg there not bad but tasted better ones A place to buy bath cloth 
9047,5,Its a nice local market perfect for shopping souvenirs to take home  Try the dumplings and the ginger tea those are so good
9048,5,Huge market with various things All the stores are in their own building They sell hair accessories jewellery kids clothing ladies clothing and many more Took the metro and stop at seoul station walked the seoullo walkaway towards Namdaemun market
9049,5,One if our favourite spots to visited day or night Crazy variety of street food at great value Also interesting to shop for souvenirs and do some bargaining
9050,4,We visited this market area one morning while waiting for Shinsegae department store to open  All the clothes and jewelry looked like cheap low quality stuff  The food stalls were ok There was one food stall that sold fish cake that was very popular
9051,5,Very busy during the weekends Do not forget to visit the Community Lounge which serves free cookies tea and other snacks  not to mention the
9052,4,the best thing you can buy in this market is pearl the prices are reasonable it is amazing place to visit in Seoul
9053,4,The entire market is enormous especially if you enter the many malls within the area itself I entered two of such malls and wanted to purchase some jewelry but was told that its not for sale to individuals only businesswholesale This was a little disappointing However the street food is delicious the hotteok in particular is a must try Its not necessary to walk the whole market as majority of the stuff on sale is repeated throughout and may be a little too oldfashioned for some tourist
9054,4,I almost got lost in this market  It is a must Please note that if you are lost or looking for specific information on the area touristic officers are located almost at every 2 streets or in the most populous area of the market
9055,4,Very central and walking distance from the metro There are hundreds of shops and stalls The usual are available shoes clothes souvenirs etc etc There are dozens of food stalls Worth the visit for budget shopping
9056,5,There is this old lady ajumma who sells almonds and all the real o brownie cheaper than anyone else in seoul I compared prices across lotte gs25 711 and all the other stores but hers were the cheapest and has the same expiry date as others  She was very kind and she offered us to try the almonds of various flavours for free I took a photo of her stall which I will share once I find it Her shop is very small and narrow along the main street down Namdaemun market
9057,5,If youre a fan of spicy braised fish soup or galchi jorim this is the place for you Hairtail Alley found in Nandaemun Market has clusters of small eateries selling this specialtyhairtail I first learned of this this place from a YouTuber and he made it look so good I knew I had to try the dish when I visited Im so glad I did The soup was to die for Im now a fan and trying to recreate a version of the dish at home
9058,3,Came here two days ago around 3 in the afternoon Pretty big and busy Its very similar to a flee market Lots of cheap looking clothes some Kpop merchandises and street food All the sellers were older people Seems like if you stop to look they expect you to buy My sister got yelled at by one of them because she was looking at some food and was still deciding if she wanted it or not Ended up not buying anything there Still a good place to explore but prefer Myeongdong instead
9059,2,You can easily get lost inside this market Its huge and most of the shops look alike Its a shopping area mainly for clothing and personal items If you are just buying a few pieces of clothing I guess you are better off shopping in other areas like Myendong where you can see more variety of goods to buy
9060,3,Seriously i doesnt really like this place but since i m in korea why not My kids like this place Locals buying here cos i think it cheap but nothing after all Place pack with ppl n cars
9061,3,This market was just opposite our hotel so we wandered over there on our first day but have to say it was very underwhelming Many of the goods looked to be straight out of China not particularly good quality the sort of things you can see in markets anywhere There were plenty of street food stalls but nothing that really appealed Most of the shops were packing up from 7pm and nothing much was open after 8pm so visit during the day or just head to Myeongdong instead
9062,5,Asian market place in downtown Seoul Hustle bustle sights sounds and smells Certainly worth the visit
9063,4,We visited this market on our last day; my husband got a good quality souvenir tshirt for just 4 Theres a lot of junk but its fun to look around and plenty of places to eat or grab a coffee The information center near Gate 5 turned out to be two people standing around handing out maps which were very useful Theres a good stationery store on the aptly named Stationery Street and a ton of camera stores all on one street
9064,5,I did buy some fruit and fried snacks from the stands They were pretty tasty I was able to buy several hats and scarves I did find some good deals The sellers were willing to bargain on some of the items The prices are were okay overall I did find purses cheaper at other markets
9065,5,Small alley down from gate 5 on left side as not easy to find famous spicy fish stew plenty of places to choose from all doing the stew fantastic food
9066,4,Looks like this is the best market in Seoul as its been going for a very long time Street food here is great lots of options and the donuts were unreal The clothing is pretty terrible and there is a lot of supreme stuff that is clearly fake Worth a visit tho for the atmosphere
9067,5,Found there is a lot to see and there is a nice selection of things a person can purchase The street food was amazing Glad I had the chance to visit
9068,4,This is the place We buy golf wear and other clothes womens men children Great selection at great negotiable prices Everything from pants shorts jackets suits sport coats Careful youll probably get asked about brand knock offs too so just ignore them
9069,3,well you wouldnt mind the crowd; Endless markets to shop; Endless road to roam; Endless line to grab a bite of  the  glassnoodle pancakehotteok Namdaemoon markets to have a sneak peak at KoreA
9070,3,I love only the street food here but I think thats enough for me The tastes are okay I dont buy anything there
9071,5,Not much English is spoken here but you can easily point and theyll understand what you want There are so many different stores such as fresh food dumplings these are a must trinkets and theres this one little cart at one of the entrances where there is usually a massive line for either a sweet or savoury bun I waited in line and the vegetable noodle bun I bought was delicious on my empty stomach You can really spend hours here and Id highly recommend visiting
9072,5,Crazy market  a must see when in Seoul  most impressive are are the food stalls  prices are OK not so cheap though it requires energy to stay there for some time 
9073,4,it was worth buying at namdaemun market though there is difficulty in communicating with the vendors prices are reasonable
9074,5,Get HoDduk in the front of Gate 2 entrance  honey filling and japchae filling Then walk up the street into the market shopping area for about 200300 yards and get dumplings and donuts
9075,4,This is fully a market place so be prepared to be bustled around by people walking fast and haggling I didnt buy anything because I was just looking but there are loads of little souvenirs things you could get and some great food too
9076,4,Huge numbers of shops selling everything from tshirts souvenirs kitchen tools etc Nice place to stroll around for 12 hours Price is reasonable
9077,4,We were able to get 3 statement shirts for krw11000  purse for 6000 You can huggle w prices in this market than Meongdong or Domdaemum  Hongik
9078,4,So much to see buy eat These markets are huge with something differnt to see around the clock Food cooked fresh and served quickly by friendly staff Lots of food choices whether it is something quick and easy by a street vendor or a sit down meal in one of the food alleyways
9079,4,Most of the market is covered which is nice on a rainy day It is very cramped but worth a visit The souvenirs were cheaper than at other places in Seoul
9080,5,You can find anything from fresh flowers homeware clothes and even toilet curtains Bought 10 pairs of socks for 700 here Very cheap and handy
9081,4,If you a looking for lots of choices for inexpensive items this is a good place to good Good place for souvenirs Also found a currency exchange booth with very good rates
9082,3,The place is near Courtyard by Marriott Hotel you could visit it by walking   We had the chance to visit the market and bought some souvenir items on a cheaper price
9083,5,Definitely worth a visit One of the great markets we have seen Try not to get lost as you stroll endless stalls Something for everyone here
9084,5,Namdaemun Market is an open air market not to far from Myong Dong in Seoul South Korea You can find many things from clothes to cookware and everything in between Put your sneakers on because you will be there all day looking for bargains The market also has many food stalls to feed your hunger as well as the hunger to shop Haggling is expected Just go and experience it Very few places like it on the planet
9085,5,been to Namdaemum Market million times and never get tired Although it is a top tourist place you can still feel the local culture and get some unique stuff However the price there is not the cheapest one so dont be fooled in addition you really need to walk around and compare the price Dont just buy the stuff from the first stand you encounter Most of the vendors here are selling the same things so shop around compare the price and try to negotiate Most importantly have fun Oh dont forget to stop by the Kalguksu Alley right near the exit 5 of Hoehyeon Station for a delicious noodle soup
9086,5,Compared to dongdaemun namdaemun market feels much more local and authentic I went in the late morning and both locals and tourists were bustling around doing their daily chores or shopping for souvenirs respectively Check out the small alleys stew alley hairtail fish alley for a claustrophobic but fun look at ajummas serving up their best food Burdeng mall and Mama were great malls for childrens clothes and accessories way better than dongdaemun but the streetside kiosks and stalls offer better prices 2000krw for 1 piece of clothing that is if you manage to find pieces you like in the jumble of clothes
9087,5,Alot of shopping for clothes and bags and souvenirs Highly recommended for people to go visit Must go
9088,4,You can easy get lost in the streets of this market Right next to Myeongdong Another place you can shop for a vast myriad of goods
9089,4,On the last day of my trip I went to Namdaemun Market to get some souvenirs for some people back in town I wanted to get some beautiful brooches for my mom and most people know ELengdang in Namdaemun market is where you can get really beautiful brooches Id like to recommend one shop that sells brooches The seller was very generous and had given us 3 free brooches after we bought some from her She had told us that she uses real swarovski crystals for her brooches The more expensive the brooches are the more beautiful it is Her shop is on the second floor and it is number 404 I have provided how the shop looks like and how beautiful the brooches that she sells If you are looking to find beautiful brooches you may visit this shop Her brooches are the most beautiful Ive found in ELengdang Have a great trip
9090,4,The street food is really good and priced cheap You can buy any sort of clothing and gifts you want Very low prices but you get what you pay for Try the food stalls at night
9091,3,Mostly cheap made items such as clothing toys and ornaments We did not really enjoy it that much as we couldnt find the unique locally made items we were hoping for
9092,3,This market is nothing but most of China made cheap goods Only very few local made items are sold A sweet made of flour and honey is the speciality and should be tried Its even more amazing to watch how this sweet is made
9093,5,Quite big and busy A lot of interesting souvenir items to buy But you can easily lost your way Make sure you use Kakao Map for navigation
9094,3,If you have time for only one place  Namdaemun or Myeongdong  I would highly recommend the latter  Because Myeongdong is still very much bustling with activities past 8pm whereas Namdaemun is a dead town by 8pm  I would only presume that because Namdaemun is closer to the downtown area therefore it might be more convenient to the people working in that area As for tourists  head down to Myeongdong You wont regret it
9095,4,Easy to get to from Meyeondong it is within walking distance from Lotte Departmental Stall too Many different types of malls catering to different thingseg clothes bags etc It will take hours to cover the area so you may want to spare some time here Many food places too
9096,4,Traditional market for travelers that love to explore the local activities Here you can find what you want to have such as street foodsnacks simple local foodbbq clothesbagsumbrella souvenirs home appliances food material kitchen equipment electronic devices camera flower accessories fake jewelry etc You can try to bargain here with your best chance to get lower prices The market is quite clean and spacious except the alleys that are located in the building FYI take a map from the information box to guide you
9097,5,Great day and night cheap fresh food souvenirs and general cheap items for sale  Safe friendly atmosphere with no pressure to purchase
9098,4,This is the best place for souvenirs we compared Myeongdong Insadong and Namdaemun Namdaemun is the cheapest among all these locations for souvenirs including tshirts key chains magnets masks etc
9099,3,This market was located opposite our hotel so it was very easy to access The market seems to sell pretty much everything including clothes kitchenware fruit and vegetables cooked food hats shoes souvenirs etc The market is actually quite large and there is a part called childrens market but it had already closed by the time we were there In front of the market along the main road are many shops selling camera gear new and used lenses and camera bodies including all the famous brands so I think this was the main place for cameras in Seoul  Despite being quite a large market there are far more interesting markets in Seoul such as the Dongdaemun Market for fashion and the Myeong Dong Street Market which was very lively and seemed much more popular
9100,3,We went here for clothes shopping Store owners do not allow you to try on the clothes they are selling so having a tape measure with us helped us to decide whether an item was the right size A lot of the stalls were pretty expensive though we spent most of the time by the clothing buildings near Hoehyoen station Exit 5 Just found less than a handful of stores with the prices we were looking for and ended up with a couple purchases Even in the summer there were still stores by the road selling fur coats Would have wanted to spend more time exploring but the heat of the day got to us  Theres a lot of stores selling dried fruits vegetables even meat I saw dried okra dried peppers dried strawberries dried octopus both spicy and not spicy the choices were endless  Theres a road with stores selling stationery wrapping paper and gift bags that had pretty attractive options We saw a couple of skincare stores as well in the area  not sure if the prices are good compared to Myeongdong There are information booths but the one we saw was closed during lunch break
9101,3,Several short streets for shopping like casual shoes Tshirts and bags Not pricey but quality matches the price Not many street food stalls Popular food to try would be the stuffed donuts and HotDeok Spent less than an hour here
9102,5,This is very good market for street shopping You can find everything clothes toys cosmetic and street food
9103,4,Got there at 730 AM on a Saturday Market not busy yet which was GREAT Lots of fun looking around and asking and checking Some of the markets are indoors so there was airconditioning I didnt buy much because the prices were generally not good deals like Ive seen in China and Malaysia but it was fun looking
9104,5,We went to the design plaza first highlight was my daughter got to play the piano outside Then onto the markets its 4 storeys of fabrics ground floor lovely quilts outside are zips and brocades top 3 floors all material Unless you are geographically minded but it when you see it I found a beaut green linen decided to look around first and couldnt find the vendor again Also no places to sit or have a cold drink inside so be prepared It was 33 degrees c when we went and even with air conditioning my kids were too hot and grumpy to go all around the building butI had no choice but to take them Fabulous selection patterns etc Next time Im finding a baby sitter
9105,5,If you are looking for what to eat in Namdaemun Market then i guess Hairtail Fish  Stew or Fried  would be be most popular choice I have not seen this Korea food being offered in other places while i was visiting Seoul and Busan during my 9 day trip in June 2018 so i suppose that this might be the only place easiest to find for such a type of Korea specialty  This fish dish is so popular that there was even 2 alley within the Namdaemum market dedicated to selling this dish With many shops offering almost the same time you would just need to look for one that would seem to be the most popular  As there was no English signboards for most of the shops we simply resorted to pointing at what the other tables were having and we were not disappointed  My family of 3 person order 1 portion of Hairtail Fish and 1 portion of Fried Assorted Fish which came with some free side dishes such as pickles beans Eggs and fried fish and rice Iced water is always provided free at the table as well  But do note that this fish does have quite abit of bones and the stew is mildly spicy But overall i think this is a perfect cuisine if you want to try something typical of this market  Getting to this market might be tricky but thankfully there are Local Guides Dressed in RED which are fluent in English and will be able to direct you to this alley
9106,3,I would say this market is fairly traditional A lot of gods a lot of fake brands narrow lanes and crowded  If you want to buy clothes from the market or well from most places be prepared Take your measures beforehand and bring your tapemeasure There are no such thing as a dressing room or trying the clothes on ;  The market felt big with numerous small isles both directions from what we called the main path As with most makets it is a lot of same same  meaning the same goods over and over  All in all it was an experience but to us Dongdaemun market with Gwangjang market next to it was better
9107,4,I went on a food tour of Namdaemun Market and sampled several types of food and drinks at the various food stalls and restaurants There were quite a number of food outlets in the market There were stalls selling all sorts of items in the market There were also shopping centres with multiple floors There were lanes with stalls selling only specific items such as military clothing and stationery  A free map of Namdaemun Market is available at the Tourist Information Center in the Market
9108,5,Namdaemun market was good They have lots of clothingstoys and accessories for children Their price for kids and adults clothes are reasonable Souvenirs at namdamun market is cheaper compared to other places Basically of all the places like Myeongdong street namdaemun is better in terms of cheaper price and more variety of items We enjoyed our shopping at namdaemun market
9109,5,This market is a must for visitors  to see the various goods there are for sale  from clothes to food  but one must try to bargain for a good buy
9110,5,A wholesale place to get your clothing accessories and gifts The shops inside the building or upper floor offer cheaper price The dumpling in this market is the best Really love the kimchi dumpling and pork dumpling If you are there you should try it 
9111,2,This area is older and smaller Many small stores filled with stuff The inside of the buildings are even worse People have crammed their wares into a small area and sit like a flea market for you to come by Its neat to see but nothing seemed light to buy At one point I used the bathroom which was a hole in the ground Cool to walk through but lower quality options
9112,4,At the beginning you assume this is just a large street market Then you go into the buildings where there are three or four floors of market stalls and realise it is enormous I found it a fascinating place to visit but there was nothing I wanted to buy There are a lot of jewellery stalls inside the buildings and quite a lot making jewellery as well as selling it
9113,4,Our hotel was just 10 mins away so we usually go through the Namdaemun market everyday Its one big market that sells the same or similar things The market was confusing at first since every stores looked alike but after a few times of getting lost we finally figured out the directions From this market is about another 810 mins walk to the other popular M market There were also a few food stands but not sure if its good or not
9114,4,Lots of items I found some really low priced souvenirs but you have to ask as they are on the second floor and inside
9115,5,This market is quite interesting Lots to shop and so much to see It is a whole day activity I suggest you take the metro to get to this market as it leads you straight to the beginning of the market
9116,4,Namdaemum Market in Seoul is worth visiting for a number of reasons First its a good cultural experience you see lots of artefacts and food items you might not have the chance of finding at home if you are a Westerner Second if you need souvenirs to take home here you have a rich range all at hand and at very convenient prices Third if you are fond of intercultural experience the market is a good place for communicating with the locals and for exchanging opinions on the products and on South Korea in general with other foreignersThe only danger you may face is that of getting lost
9117,1,Nothing interesting Do not go in fish restaurant area it was a terrible experience Bad food bad service
9118,5,Be sure not to reach too early as the shops are mostly open only after 930am So have a good breakfast before you head down Do take note that this market isnt open on Sunday Right across The Courtyard at Marriot Namdaemun Market is made up of street stalls shops lining the streets on ground level of old buildings and old shopping malls selling wholesale clothes jewelry etc Just roam and explore u will find surprises in every corner Stuff mostly for kids and women not so much for men Chanced upon a mall that sell nothing but children clothes They are meant to be for wholesale and preorder but they do sell single pieces too Saw so many of these children clothes selling at Doota Mall Dongdaemun at double or triple the price Be sure not to buy them at Doota There is also another mall that sells just clothes for adults Its hard to give directions as they are like hidden gems amongst the many street stalls If u happen to be in the mall selling jewelry dont be alarm if the stall owners refuse to sell single pieces to you They are for bulk purchases and preorder You are lucky if u found a couple of friendly ones that dont mind selling the jewelry in pieces to you The hair clips especially are very pretty
9119,2,Went to visit Namdaemun Market late night Got 5 small dishes and 2 sodas with my wife The bill came out to \111000 or 10900 Are you kidding me That price is more than our food bills for 3 days combined A ver bad experience indeed
9120,2,2nd time coming here and still seem to miss the action The last time we were too early coming before our flight this time we were too late as most of the stalls and shops were closing We were there just before dinner of about 730pm The girls were disappointed
9121,5,Variety of localy priduced clothes and goods From tshirt to tops to leather jackets to hats they have it all And the street food stalls spread around exit 5 to fill your tummy if you are hungry or treat your taste buds
9122,4,It has something for everybody here and have sufficient variety that it is quite a good place to get everything
9123,5,Namdaemun market feels like a friendly street market environment which is a welcome reprieve from other pushy and rude again markets in other Asian countries Go and sample delicious street cuisine and explore various clothing stalls to find something unique
9124,5,Great place to wander try foods yes the place seems a bit sketchy but feel free to eat Youll be fine and may have your best meal pick up souvenirs and enjoy
9125,3,It is a market were you can find multiple things  hand bags stationary jewel clothing too umbrellas and more It is a huge complex and besides what you see in the street there are doors with an inside commerce
9126,3,A traditional market for people of all ages It depicts quite well the kind of lifestyle people have from the young to elderly The market sells clothes household stuff and food
9127,5,Doesnt matter how old you are but you will have a good time here day or night And I think they keep most An Korea old style trade and have a lot new thing too  They sell everything here and lot a good food too I mean all kind of food west or east what ever We love come here to eat and walk around
9128,4, Easy to get here via Subway Line 4 Hoehyeon Station Exit 5  Variety of stalls  shops of clothing shoes bags souvenirs handicrafts food fruits  groceries too Do get the markets map it is big and all streets almost looking the same as all streets filled with variety of goods  Some stalls can get good bargains if intended to buy lots Generally all stallshop owners are very polite They dont force buying from them  English is not widely use in this market but all stallshop owners are approachable When comes to pricing  bargaining calculator will be the tool  medium to conclude the deal
9129,5,Visited twice one time on a Sunday Shops were closed but streets were lined with hawkers and clothes sellers Prices were very good too  During another weekday visit the place came to live with shops all open and streets were still filled with foodstalls and clothes sellers Plenty to see and do and buy as well  Shopping here is good and with more competitive prices than Bangkok for clothes as well Tourists Guides are positioned on the streets to help tourists with questions and information Nice place to visit near Myeongdong
9130,5,We spent about 15 hrs waking around and exploring the market Plenty to see if you go in the morning if you like look at fresh produce and seafood They sell lots of accessories souvenirs and clothes but dont expect high fashion and chic products here  The street food here is more traditional and tastier than in MyeongDong Look for the yummy freshly made dumplings right in the middle of the market they are cheap and delicious
9131,4,Dont hesitate to go visit the place This is amazing to see the shopping temptations all over the area
9132,5,Look for the alley with fish stew There are many shops there and they serve simple food Did not disappoint even when Ive tried a few different shops Prices are not that expensive too  68k per pax could give you a wonderful meal
9133,4,Big big and more big A lot af market stall Walk see and buy IT takes you a lot of time to walk around the whole marker but no problem you can visit this market every day and iT is naar the centrum and the grand station
9134,5,Good place for budget travellers Many items are relatively cheap But Bangkok and KL are way much better and cheaper
9135,5,We had many of our meals over here and got to know many of the local stall holders and the food was to die for You can always get a bargain but do your homework first know the exchange rate from your own currency to won and know the cost of items back home always good to get a bargain but not at either your expense or the expense of the stall holder You will not see all this market has to offer in a couple of hours and dont be afraid to go down the alleyways and side streets this is a huge place as are many of the markets You will find some great bargains and memorable food Dont forget to take your camera
9136,5,This market is easy to get to via taxi  I just showed them a photo of it on Trip Advisor and the driver knew right where to go I spent a couple hours walking through the streets and shops Plenty of people there and a lot of great street food The vendors mostly speak English which made communication easy When it was time to go taxis were waiting at most of the gates
9137,2,Namdaemun Market is busy and filled to the brim with great street food cheap souvenirs and a general variety of goods If this is what youre looking for then its definitely worth a visit There are so many vendors that you could probably spend the good part of a day if you wanted to visit them all However we spent less than an hour because it just wasnt for us; the crowds were extreme and most of them tourists and stall owners would be calling us from every side trying to sell this and that  most of it things you would find hard to explain a real need for  I do have to praise the food It is cheap and most of it is fresh and made before you Its also eaten by locals which is always a good sign I just didnt see much value in the shops stock and didnt enjoy the busy tourist crowds There are other markets I would rather frequent
9138,5,The streets here are wider than Myeong Dong and prices of food might be cheaper too Since we were travelling with stroller we were not able to penetrate or go in Myeong Dong as the place was packed when we went So we opted to go here instead  We bought some socks belt jeans facial wash and ate tons of street food We loved the store that sold dumplings and meat buns
9139,4,This market is very big with lots of entrance leading to different sections It is an open air market with buildings on the side which each building specialized in different products There are sections and building specialized in infant to childrens clothes shoes and accessories mens items jewelries mattresses ladies shoes clothes etc There is even a section where you can find alteration services Things a relatively cheap and even cheaper if buy in bulk as they sell stuff in wholesale prices Do drop by this market if you are in the vicinity and their shops open early too
9140,4,A great local atmosphere you will find diversity of food articles and accessories closing and much more this is a place to go in the morning and get a fantastic breakfast with locales
9141,2,Huge area many multi store buildings Most of the merchandise is junk just there is really really really many kinds and piles of junk
9142,4,Our guide said this was the best market in Seouk for shopping Many vendors have their own factories to produce goods for sale at better quality and prices than elsewhere Certain types of goods are concentrated on named streets Lots and lots of shops and places to eat  some just stalls others are full service sit down We spent almost 2 hours strolling and eating in the neighborhood
9143,5,A very busy market in the heart of the city where toy get literally from A to Z Qualitywise not necessarily to notch but fun to browse through the narrow alleys and to take in the bit so familiar scents If you have a tenancy to be claustrophobic I would not recommend a visit during busy hours At times youre blocked but people hardly able to move forward or backward neither left or right and in parts underground  I enjoy observing the hustle and bustle of people and browsing for a typical Joann item like brass dishes or similar  Generally its mostly about clothing but my size is never available neither my style  Very close by for larger wallets the first Shinsegae hosting upscale designer boutiques and a nice food section in B1  On the other end of the market the name giving Nandaemun the former city gate and national treasure No1  it sadly burned down ca 10 yrs ago but was restored to its full glory  All in all go and visit as its truly any experience
9144,5,Namdaemun is one of the best markets to visit in Seoul and sells a very large variety of goods If you want clothes food souvenirs or even cameras then this is the place to come The market is divided into general areas where you can find specific items childrens clothing section camera section etc The market is particularly famous for its camera section which offers decent prices on both new and second hand cameras from all brands Fuji and Olympus users may have some trouble here but Nikon Canon and Sony are well represented For electronics alone though Yongsan is better
9145,1,This market is full of counterfeited goods and just junk in general Myeongdong and Insadong are both much better
9146,5,I am so amazed in this very clean market I enjoyed variety of goods being sold If you are a foreigner in this country and love to cook this is the best place to buy the ingredients I think the prices are reasonable enough You just have to go around first to know who sell with least price
9147,5,This market seems to be a lower market compared to the Myeongdong Market just a block down the road I thought that there was a bit more food options here and it was cheaper Walked past a Hotteok stand and had to get one cause it just smelt so nice There were plenty of shops and stalls lining the road which seemed to be cheaper too Plenty of entrances around so shouldnt be too difficult to find Seems more like a local market than a tourist one which is why I thought it was a nice change
9148,1,Namdaemun Market is very large and repetitive It is a dense maze of uninteresting clothing and trinkets The street food in Korea in general is not very interesting considering how accessible and varied the restaurants are; mostly variations on fried things all breaded in the same batter In terms of absolute number of food stalls in the entire Namdaemun area it might be a largeish number but they are sparsely scattered between an astronomical number of allthesame clothingtextiletrinket stalls all of which just look kind of depressing
9149,3,You can find all kinds of cheap things on this market From souvenirs to clothes and shoes Also there are a few street food stalls
9150,5,Namdaemun Market is the largest traditional market in South Korea with selling a variety of goods from clothes to accessories ginseng and spectacles etc The market is adjacent to Myeongdong and takes about 1015 minutes by foot to get there Although Namdaemun Market might not be that far away the chilly autumn breeze certainly made it a walk to remember  It can be considered as a wholesale market so items sold here are usually priced reasonably and you save the more you buy Of course you may also try your hand at bargaining  We were there to get some ginseng theres a ginseng street Definitely a place worth visiting For more on the experience and photos please check out my blog 
9151,5,If you are planning to go on bargain shopping while in Seoul look no furtherNamdaemun Market is the place to visit Anything from coats bags shoes souvenirs and even street food you can find them all here at much cheaper prices than at the famous Myeongdong Shopping Street You can also grab a delicious meal at the many restaurants scattered around the area also at cheaper prices Your trip to Seoul would definitely not be complete without a visit to the Namdaemun Market  PS This stop is also part of the hopon hopoff tour on the Seoul City Sightseeing Bus Route A Downtown Palace
9152,4,The true authentic atmosphere of Seoul can be found in this place It is a market for locals in which you will be able to find everything Great experience
9153,5,I tried a lot of tokbokki but I really liked the tokbokki here in Namdaemun market Stores sells a lot of ginseng products nuts dried fruits underwear clothings shoes and accessories This is the best time to be in Seoul spring season Not too cold and not too hot to go walking outside and enjoy this vibrant city Cant wait to be back here again
9154,4,A market that offers variety items at fair price Bought souvenir items and a hanbok Enjoyed the tteokbokki at one of the food stalls Pleasant  very helpful sellers  You can haggle A must visit if your looking for variety  bargain
9155,4,Great selection of anything really Its a market be prepared for different styles and qualities I didnt haggle because I didnt think it was worth it for the item but you can probably try  Be prepared to spend a couple of hours here Theres also plenty of food to try
9156,4,This is a very large market in Seoul where you can find pretty nearly any item you can imagine It is somewhat like organized chaos It is worth strolling through the market even if you arent interested in shopping just to see the spectacle of it
9157,4,Large market where you can find lots of things from food to clothes and souvenirs its not a must go but if you have time why not spend some time there
9158,5,The market has many whole sale stores Its a busy area and you can buy nice things in a good price but youll have to bargin Id recommend an hour or two to walk around and get a glimpse of whats going on
9159,2,Instagram oppakuliner  This is a typical flea market there are many stores here but its more expensive than the other flea market Ive visited in Seoul Its too crowded also and not find anything good and worth to buy here For me is no
9160,3,It is quite a large market and is spread out Most shops were of accessories some weird and wonderful street food The shops were cheaper than other supermarket The market is easily accessible as it is in the middle of the city and surprisingly is open till late at night
9161,3,Our guide allowed 45 minutes to stay in the market which was not enough However we bought nice local products and souvenirs with good prices
9162,4,Largest traditional market in Seoul full of bustle locals and tourists mingle at this location The market is cut out into sections and one can get lost easily since its huge Cheap finds such as 2nd hand clothings selling at 5000won from the push carts Easily accessible via subway Hoyeon station just one stop away from Seoul station and Myeongdong
9163,5,Many people come here to get cheaper stuff seaweed and babytoddler clothes here  There are many eateries in this area as well and also a popular traditional eating place where you go jnto the market and sit side by side to eat As the place is quite cramp it is not advisable to have many things with you especially if have kids and strollers  There is also a famous brand nail cutter which can be found here If you know what Im talking about  There is an area which sells lots of babytoddlers clothes and some area looks like those in Bangkok with lots of small shops within it
9164,4,We spent a couple of hours here having great fun just wondering up and down the aisles of stores So much to see so many wonderful smells Plenty to eat and plenty of cheap market goods to buy
9165,5,This is a large and busy market Lots of clothes food souvenirs toys and housewares I did not see much in the way of art like you would get at Insadong Definitely a good choice for a market experience It is also an easy walk to Sungnyemun Gate which is a great photo spot juxtaposing history with modern
9166,5,Unlike any place we have ever been the food was amazing and so many shops and stands to go through You could spend days and not see everything My wife flew here to visit and was highly impressed by the culture and how nice everyone was We loved Seoul and taking a taxi from our hotel to the market was a breeze I highly recommend that if you visit Seoul you hit up this market We went early 0900 on a Saturday and it was good we did because when we left at 3pm it was packed
9167,5,The place is always full of life Food everywhere lobsters strawberries chicken pancakes rice cakes icecream topped with raw honey fruits grilled steamed boiled anyway you can think off they have it Big and small restaurants standalone stalls stalls peddling clothes bags etc Huge department stalls brand name stores all you need to shop to your hearts desire
9168,5,Cheap place to buy souvenirs especially brooches fashionable socks and a lot more Highly recommended
9169,4,Not so upmarket but there are nice earrings and souvenirs to buy need to find your way around as the roads look similar
9170,1,Tried to hit up this market around 1130 pm at night as we heard it comes alive in the evening Got there and most of the vendors were closed Can someone shed some light on this Maybe because it was unseasonably cold
9171,5,Very nice market with lots of things to see and buy if you need You can find anything and everything you want Be prepared to spend all day if you search for something special I like it
9172,3,Well its a street Bazaar Ive seen a lot of bazaars but Ive never seen people as unfriendly as here Incredible The quality of all things is not good but a bit cheaper than somewhere else
9173,2,1 hour just because I am walking with a 2 and 4YO Found some unique street food and also a fruit shop corner lot near Seoullo information booth that sold cheap strawberries If your intention is to buy souvenirs in bulk then this may be suitable
9174,4,If you are tourist this place one of market sell good food clothes include jacketcoat when winter season and souvenir with good price
9175,4,We just came here for food We went to gate 5 where a bunch of streetfoods were ready to satisfy our mouth Enjoy the gyeranbbang egg cake croquette mandu dumpling assorted of fried bread and oden fish cake Surely will come again to try many seafood stalls there
9176,4,Traditional market easily accessible In my opinion here is better than Myeongdong area for shopping
9177,5,Excellent markets with everything you can think of from clothing and shoes to fresh foods seafood and everything inbetween  Too much to list and prices can be negotiated slightly  Only 500m walk from Seoul subway station line 4  Well worth a visit  Shop Till You Drop 
9178,2,Closes early and repeats most of the stuff which Myeongdong has  but with fewer eateries Trinkets are cheap knockoffs Some of the skincare products and food products may be slightly cheaper but it is probably not worth coming by unless 1 you are buying in bulk 2 have a lot of spare time in Seoul  Avoid
9179,5,Great place for street food and shopping Make sure to get there early For some reason they close quicker than other night markets
9180,4,Bought some skincare products and loads of souvenirs from here The price are relatively cheaper on some skincare products compared to Myeongdong but some are almost similar So if you want to shop here youd probably do some research at Myeongdong beforehand But for souvenirs such as key chains seaweed small bags coin purses ginseng liquor  we found it is cheaper here and we bought it in bulk
9181,3,I bought lots and lots of kpop merch from Blackpink to Got7 to Twice everything is available here But my main issue was that they closed way too early I went by 8 pm and almost every store was closed or closing Its still an awesome place to buy kpop goods 
9182,2,My point of view that is a market for locals not really for tourists you can explore shops selling clothing hardware home necessity sewing cheap and average price Overall market is too big but not a tourist attraction
9183,3,Advice to come here during the day time  for street food  snacks  souvenirs  which was cheaper 
9184,3,We very much preferred the Myeongdong market over this one This market is older but seemed to be just shirts and clothes not the diversity in Myeongdong But we loved walking the streets and seeing the food and people
9185,5,i went to take a photo at namdaemunmost important is to buy a pair of glovesthere are few streets dedicated to sales of different commodityeg shoe street souvenir street and food streetthe prices of souvenirs are the cheapest herebut still must scout around as different stall offer different pricethe famous almond nuts i bought at 5000wonthe other places are selling at 5500won or 6000 wonmany choices of souvenirs eg keychains pens pouchesgreat to buy all you need from herewill come here again for sure
9186,5,Theres plenty of places to eat for a very affordable price and you can tell the authenticity of the food because the aunties are manning the stalls Needless to say the food was so scrumptious specially the bulgogi People are friendly despite not being able to speak English well
9187,4,Namdaemun Market is a great market to wander and experience and see what a traditional street market is like This market is very organized and there are helperstourist info guides to help you navigate the market There is also an information booth in the middle of the market that has free maps of the market and area and it is a great place to stop and get yourself orientated The market is divided up in sections and the map has landmarks and the sections listed The food in the market is very good and cheap and it is advisable to go there on an empty stomach You will find cheap souvenirs here as well
9188,3,To be honest I cannot say I liked this place much Everything wasnt a good quality the only thing I bought there ware chopsticks which then I found cheaper ones in the Insadong However the food was really good
9189,3,If youre game for street food this is your place Id arrived with a tummy upset and after day 1 in the hotel I wasnt being too adventurous There was lots of clothing shoes and junky souvineers that didnt take my fancy The other half enjoyed the street food We were out and about early and it was Monday I suspect a quiet day for the market as it didnt seem that busy I was a bit disappointed really Id been expecting better quality stuff
9190,5,They have tourist lounge gate two next to ginseng shop They give free snacks and coffee Food is cheap if you eat in small alley place 8t for grill fish 4 fish rice n steam egg A lot of places selling ginseng dont know if real or fake Almonds and seaweed sold everywhere
9191,4,Street food here is quite good I sampled tons Didnt buy anything besides food Lots of stuff you dont need clothes souvineers shoes  I didnt need any of that stuff so I just looked mainly at the food
9192,5,I came here to buy something for my office workers got a pretty keychain for 5k won i get 10pcs pack They sell others too like magnets pretty chopsticks cheap clothes 10k get 3
9193,3,Amm dont know what to say but if u like to see this market which includes fish fruit stationery and not original brand come and see as u can Bargain them
9194,3,Not much different than the markets you can find in most of the Worlds cities  Lots of stalls selling the same thing I tried some fried dumplings the woman tried to get me to buy 4 instead of the 2 I asked for so I didnt ask to buy the other things I wanted as she had soured our deal 
9195,4,This is a nice market to visit from live fish to home appliances and everything in betweennot exactly cheap
9196,4,Travelling solo i explored the nooks and corner of this street and found a number of knick knacks to take home The experience was great in terms of shopping as well trying local street food
9197,5,The place is really large I didnt get to getting all around the market The market is easy to get with public transportation So many items u can buy and cheaper than other places
9198,4,Huge market are with variety of shops including wholesale stores Prepare the get lost in the alleys Good place for souvenir shopping
9199,4,Namdaemun market is one of traditional market in Seoul Unlike any other markets they classified the shop based on what they sell We went there to find things for kids Unfortunately some of the shop were already closed perhaps due to the weather This market is known for its foods alley too For noodle lovers you should visit kalguksu alley near gate 5
9200,4,Namdaemun Market is quite central You can find food clothes makeup glasses lots of glasses karaoke bars and anything you could think of It is veeeeeery crowded and loud mostly young people There is one place where young musicians and bands sing and make music for everyone This was very nice to see and listen Definitely recommended
9201,4,This is basically a pedestrian shopping mall Spread out over a couple blocks it first opened in 1964 It was interesting to see some of the different food places with donuts fruits etc We saw lots of shoes and some squiggly root looking things in water jars There were also lots of shoe stores It is probably a good place for souvenirs along with Insadong street We did meet people here who spoke English to help us
9202,5,Ive been there with my gf around a month ago Weve eaten various street food and seen lots lots of shooping area I think it will be a super great experience if it is your first visit in Korea 
9203,3,This was fun to walk around and gain steps Not as nice as it has been in the past Could have been due to very cold temps Vendors did not seem interested in bargaining Still fun to walk around
9204,5,The thing is Im a picky eater I dont usually eat unusual foods but I had to try them here You can also find silk mattresses and all the sorts here in great material If I had enough baggage Id buy tons of those
9205,5,Our visit to Korea was great but I found the culinary experience to be lacking Food was pricey but underwhelming in every restaurant we visited Maybe we just went to the wrong places to eat  We ventured to explore Namdaemun market in front of our hotel in the last few days of our trip We were not disappointed It was a tourist haven Food was cheap authentic and delicious So much variety I loved the huge dumplings It was the best Bang for every buck  You can also shop for cheap stuff in the market There were a lot of winter clothes on sale street food and a lot of souvenirs My best buy was the Rimowa looking luggage set Small Medium and Large for only P 9000 or about USD 180  Be sure to visit Namdaemun Market when in Korea
9206,5,Went to the Namdaemun market in the after noonthere are many kind of street foods such as Hoddock  Ddockboki fish cakesand a lot of shops there you can buy whatever you want  Should visit there if you travel in Korea 
9207,1,I thought that markets stuff would be a lot cheaper  But NO The ppl tries to grab ur arm tightly so u couldnt escape or walk pass their items most of the bags there are expensive they tried to sell me a small makeup bag  a simple one  for 32 000 won like seriously  I had to give them an uncomfortable look and just pull my arms from them i was so nervous to even look closely to the items sold there cos they can be grab u by the arms and its hard to let loose  NOT COOL  The items sold there isnt any unique either cos u can find similar items at myeondong underground shopping or the street You dont have to come to namdaemun market trust me its expensive Unless u are there just to eat or take photos  However u can find a store that sells international groceries around the market If u are looking for Halal food
9208,5,If you are to bargain and wholesales go here Just keep bargain walk around check for different prices Even if they dont speak well english just put a price on their calculator  50 lower than what they tell you ;  Asian insights and intel knowledge
9209,3,I decided to bring my family to Namdaemun Market for this trip However it was slightly disappointing Saw a few YouTube clips to confirm our visit there Basically if you were to look for really cheap stuffs There are many wholesale retailers there selling great varieties of items like fashion and home products etc As for food wise I dont see a great variety of food We bought some red bean buns but didnt finish them off We ended up in a restaurant near exit 5 for our lunch Can give it a try to patronise the restaurant that offer nice Ginseng Chicken Soup which located on the second floor of a building
9210,3,Had been to Skorea many times Namdaemun stall owners from China rather rudeShe supposed to pass the foods pack to me instead she just throw at the table however someof the stall are pretty kind and introduce some street foods to us But expensive but just try it if you are looking for their local foods
9211,5,A must place to visit of u wanna buy gifts n souvenirs U can havr a good bargain and lots of things tobuy 
9212,5,Some of the reviews mentioned this to be a night market but not sure A bit disappointed as this market was not the bustling place that I expected compared to other markets in parts of Asia Most shops selling winter wear In fact all markets and roadside stalls everywhere we went in Seoul seemed to be selling winter wear Time of the year I Guess Food stalls were few and far between though there was 1 stall selling delicious dumplings close to the metro entrance
9213,4,The setup is similar to Malaysias Petaling Street Selling clothings shoes souvenirs practically everything Do try some street food if you are here I bought 26 fridge magnets here for 10000won Also bought 10 nail cutters for 10000won Just to provide you an idea of the prices here I didnt bargainso maybe if you do you can get stuffs at lower prices than me
9214,5,If you are in Seoul you must visit this market the socalled the citys largest market You can get almost anything here from clothing souvenirs purses and food supplies Many stalls are open into the wee hours of the morning A very good shopping experience in Seoul We managed to buy the Supreme clothing souvenirs fruits and also accessories here There are lots of stalls  you will get lost easily finding your way outdefinitely worth the visit
9215,2,The atmosphere at night here is a stark contrast to Myeongdong It is dimlylit and most of the vendors there look jaded and less enthusiastic about hawking their tiredlooking wares Though a few of their products there appear cheaper to Myeongdong ones they do not add up to much savings The goods hawked are dated and nothing special Not worth the trip
9216,5,If you come Seoul dont miss to visit here It seem to be China Town in Korea If you are traveller you can find every things about Korea in here Foods snack gifts and etc the price is reasonable
9217,4,Very good selections of choice of things to buy And street food as well Do shop around before you decide which shop to buy from Same product might be selling at different price just a shop away
9218,5,Best place to get fresh and reasonable priced strawberries Saw some tourists bought boxes of it to be brought home Definitely cheaper than department stores and myeongdong market
9219,5,I had not been here for almost 25 years I could still find my way around and loved the hoetok sweet pancakes that I remember as a kid
9220,5,Its not your fancy and most urban market if you are going for that reasons But if you want to experience the most famous street food and buy a souvenirs with a super reasonable prices so its your destination
9221,4,It was a very diverse market lots of bags clothes scarves Baby clothes and if you go inside the building in the side street the wholesalers are in there Lots of market stalls that sells almost anything and everything from food ginsengclothes accessories etc
9222,4,Namdaemun Market is more of a traditional style shopping area It open early morning and close late night  The retail streets are divided into several categories like Childrens Clothes Street WatchJewelry Street Fashion Street Military Uniform Street Bedding Street Mountain Climbing Equipment Street Camera Street StationeryToy Street Food Material Street Food streets include Chopped Noodles Street and FishStew Street  it a must place to visit if you in korea  ps  there visitors information booth if you need any assistance 
9223,4,We enjoyed this market a few times They dont hassle you Street food entertaining and good Tourist help there as well We were told when we went to Korea to buy socks We bought many pounds of them You pay basically 2 a pair but you buy in packs There is a ton of modernism in Seoul so this market was a treat
9224,4,It can get very crowded but a good place to get souvenirs and casual necessities This market place is known for galchi jjim spicy silver eel stew by the locals but street food is good too It is also known for many eyeglass places above and underground where you can get great stylish back up glasses Be sure to bargain when purchasing goods but not food
9225,5,Few of the shops were closed on the week at evening after 6pm but there were still plenty of delicious street food I should have bought more sweet rice cakes from the old man they were so delicious Remember to visit the Kalguksu alley The ajummas cooking are loud when trying to get you to sit down at their table but so sweet and kind when serving Should have visited Namdaemun market once more will do it next time in Seoul
9226,4,If you are seriously looking for accessories shopping This is a great place So much to choose from you have to know what you are looking for and send me idea of pricing as you can truly find awesome deals I can spend all day here but no as I will go broke if you have few hours I highly recommend for shopping and gifts Friendly people and many speaks English and good food
9227,4,This is biggest day and night market in Seoul It opens early and closed late at night time You can find almost anything you need here It does gets really busy There are things that are expensive but when it comes to eating It is really cheap and good It is located near the train station If you see a building called Common Plaza you are basically there The vendors sels everything in bulk If you see this place called Hyojason King Dumplings They make fresh food on the spots everyday Also walk pass Hyojason King Dumplings you should see it on the right hand side a restaurant called Namdeamun Charcoal bbq Must stop here for their food It is really good and cheap
9228,4,Its a tourist destination therefore nothing is cheap here particularly over the weekend I see a lot of tourists with big shipping bags here but I really dont know if they get a real deal Lots of other tourists destinations nearby but are disguised by the luster of this market
9229,5,The market place existed very few hundred years and still going strong You will find everything and able to bargain for it Its discovery experience if you know what you are looking for
9230,4,This is a street market concept unlike Myeongdong or Hongdae  Street stalls street food carts messy looking shops  all part of this street market atmosphere  Prices here are cheaper no doubt but dont expect to find branded or high quality products here  There is a building within that sells wholesale accessories but purchases has to be in bulk They dont accept 1 or 2 pieces buy  Atmosphere is nice though especially if weather is cooling  Worth a visit This place is within walking distance to Myeondong Shopping Street Namsan Park  Shinsegae Department store
9231,4,We arrived about 1930 at the market but we saw that many stands already had closed down we visited in autumn The food stands however were still open and we enjoyed some street food from a local elderly couple who kept on giving us more and more samples for tasting The dumplings at the corner of a cross road were additionally excellent
9232,4,This is quite a huge market with a lot of small lanes It could be intimidating for first timer to be honest but enjoyable nonetheless Theres also Muslim friendly food at this market located in the small alley where they sell galchi jorim grilled fish and serve the best fried fish imo as banchan It could be hard to find at first but once you know the way it would be a breeze just make sure you have a map with you if youre unfamiliar with the place
9233,4,If you like shopping this is the place to go You can easily spent 34 hours in the market From clothes shoes souvenirs and street foods Must visit in Seoul
9234,4,My favorite meal in Korea was in this market I ate standing up at a street dumpling restaurant They were making the dumplings right there so fresh and delicious  I kept going in circles and finding myself right back in a spot I had already visited
9235,3,This is huge and full of things to buy socks souvenirs clothes purses hats food ginseng I would say worth visiting as this is very special Probably good place to buy at low prices not for every taste If you are looking for traduire outfits youll find a few stores there Good for the experience not my favorite shopping place
9236,5,Thankfully there seem to be many traditional markets remaining in Seoul This is certainly a nice one if not large in scale and there are many good stalls Its proximity to the subway station and several nice coffee shops and excellent eateries all moderately priced by Seoul standardsor even compared with Seoul University Station just down the roadmake it a good and efficient place to spend a few hours browsing and relaxing while completing the mornings or afternoons shopping  Very pleasant Its relatively smaller scale is for me part of its charm
9237,5,We walked from Myeongdong to Namdaemun Market It is just opposite and walking distance to there It is always very crowded for street shopping  foods
9238,4,Exciting market where the line shop till you drop becomes a reality There are buildings after buildings of shops with clothing apparel shoes and everything in between Haven for wholesalers too
9239,5,The market has tons of shops indoor and outdoor The best I found was the Orange Building Enter by Gate 2 and walk straight and the orange building will be on your left you will enter through the luggagehandbag section and take the escalator up to the 2nd floor and there are souvenirs as far as the eye can see
9240,4,Our favourite haunt while we were at Seoul Crazy in the day and crazier at night Close to seoul station meongdong and hoeyeon stations Food clothes bags belts accessories  anything for a cut price Happy shopping
9241,2,Although i have visited Seoul several times this is the first time I visited Namdaemun It was quite crowded Most shops sold clothes and souvenirs not up to my interest
9242,4,A great place for the food hunter A lot of choices for shopping also Nearby subway for easy access A must go place when u visit korea
9243,5,A great place to come visit with hundreds of stalls selling all types of clothes and souvenirs  Saw some of the food stalls on a YouTube blog and had to give the dumplings and hot dog on a stick a try  This market is also very close to Myeondong so definitely check it out
9244,4,A traditional market with lots of clothes bags shoes and foodstuff There are stalls to roam about and malls to explore  There is a mall that sells only childrens clothing Loved the variety of clothes available Keep a lookout for clothes on special offer for good buys
9245,5,If you dont enjoy crowded places avoid the market on weekends But if you can bear with it you can have good street food and buy cheap souvenirs here dont forget to bargain
9246,4,They seemed to have some more traditional foods I didnt see any chicken skewers meatballs or fried chicken One really popular item was a stuffed pancake with mungbean I think its called a Hotteok There was also a dumpling stall I liked
9247,5,Like nothing I have ever experience before Worth checking out in the afternoon Each part of the market has different things for sale  clothing bags kids etc Fun experience Very different TONS of people so only go if you like crowds
9248,4,Namdaemun Market is just a few blocks from Myeongdong Myeongdong seems to attract the younger generations whereas Namdaemum attracts all age groups in general  Namdaemum covers a few city blocks with a few main streets and a lot of alleys I found that the whole area is quite confusing Most of the stores and vendors sell similar things clothing handbags socks street food produce etc It is difficult to find a landmark If you happen to find the information booth get a site map and it helps to navigate the area  We visited the area on a Saturday afternoon Surprisingly it was not too crowded May be it was their National holiday week We had a handmade noodle lunch at a tiny alley which is near the information booth The space of that vendor is really tight and it can only seat 4 people For US5 you are served with kimchi 1 bowl of cold noodle and 1 large bowl of hot noodle soup The noodle lady was very friendly and she refilled the kimchi once we finished The noodle was very good  A few days later we visited again on a week day around 530pm a lot of the vendors have already closed and only those along the main street were still open So if you plan to visit choose a day visit on the weekend  I didnt see any public washroom in the area
9249,5,Street food and shopping
9250,4,always a symbol of Seoul though lots of shops closed Myeongdong is still a fun place to be
9251,5,Convenient place for shopping
9252,5, One of the famous streets of Korea If you want to take a walk in the evening do some shopping then you are welcome 
9253,5,It was crowded with people of various races 
9254,5,Great place to walk at night to check out the street vendors Lots of food vendors Its of course very touristy but I cant deny the good times I had with my family here Lots of good street food I highly recommend the chicken kabob 
9255,4,Not as many as before
9256,4, Its not as lively as in the old days but a lot of people have increased There are still many empty vacancies 
9257,5,Nice place for sight seeing
9258,1,So many shop are empty or move out Not as crowded as before covid started Really pity to see this pandemic cause so much different
9259,1,I got here by 7pm Everything is closing Just wasting  time
9260,4,Not too crowded for nowadaysthisperiod  mayjuly2022
9261,5,lots of goods
9262,4,Nearby Hotel have roof top coffee cafe
9263,3,A lot of shops crowdy for shopping afficionados ;
9264,3,Its cool
9265,3,Sadly changed a lot after COVID with a number of retail places out of business
9266,5,Really relaxing atmosphere with really nice hidden shops and restaurants
9267,5,Cute cats nice host drink included And very clean
9268,5,cool
9269,4,Nice clean streets lots of options for food shopping kitschy things
9270,5,I heard a lot about covid shutting this place down but though I never visited precovid its definitely up and running now Every shop you could possibly need starts here from Zara to dalgona stalls it 
9271,3, It was a pity that I didnt have the flashiness of the past Due to the corona virus the attractions in Myeongdong have decreased a lot 
9272,5,Beautiful shopping experience and very good street food
9273,3, I didnt feel like I was before Corona Those who go thinking about that time will not be disappointed 
9274,2,Likely due to COVID19 meausures Myeongdong is past its heyday now Many many closed shops I wouldnt bother going there as things are right now
9275,3,On the positive side its not too crowded now but that is because there are so many empty store places It gives it a bit of a getto feel Weird because the businesses that are still there are the big companies like Nike etc So certainly not what it was four years ago I hope it picks up
9276,4,Sad to see that MyeongDong shopping street is not as bustling as before due to covid situation Manage to come to this street for a visit ever still travel restriction relax 
9277,5,Happening market place ij seoul Must visit
9278,5,No 1 tour place in Seoul
9279,4,Good place for shopping and street food
9280,5,This is the best shopping paradise in Korea
9281,4,quite a number of food stalls nearby brisk walking ot window shopping is the best excercise you can do after eating fried chicken with beers
9282,5, There are a lot of shops of different price categories Its amazing how so many buildings fit in such a small area A very colorful place is a must for the room 
9283,3,COVID has changed the shopping landscape completely with almost all beauty shops shuttered with the exception of Olive Young Feels like a ghost town Lots of construction noises though so hopefully they will reopen in the near future 
9284,5,Best area for tasting local food and some very good shopping area The street gets really busy in peak hours
9285,4, Seoul Myeongdong A shopping street full of various brand shops and a lot of various restaurants 
9286,4, Before Corona it was very crowded but now a lot of business places are closed Street food sales have also decreased a lot Its too quiet 
9287,2, After Corona many stores are missing so there is nothing to see and nothing to shop 
9288,4, Myeongdong street like never before Stores closing one by one No tourists due to corona 
9289,5,I enjoyed the walking with my family
9290,5, The church is good and I am satisfied with the spring outing 
9291,5,Delicious food Thai restaurant
9292,5,Super nice
9293,1,most stores closed the door but peoples are there I think most of them are just workers working around here and going for a walk around after lunch which means they are not shoppers
9294,3, Its a street in Myeongdong that I havent been to in a long time but all the commercial areas are dead 
9295,5, Myeongdong street is not like it used to be I hope you can get back to your daily life as soon as possible 
9296,5, In February 22 22 almost all firstfloor shopping malls were closed due to the longterm impact of Corona and many buildings were vacant 
9297,3, Its too bad the streets are quiet and there are too many closed places Its not the romantic street it used to be Im upset 
9298,5, Its a weekday so its not crowded and its cleaner than I thought 
9299,3, Empty stores and a small number of street vendors When will the former glory be TTTT 
9300,5, It was the first time I visited since Corona and the business district was so sad that it died Hope you recover soon 
9301,3,Dont plan to go there during national holidays like the Lunar New Year 90 of the shops and restaurants were closed On the good side at least it wasnt crowded We just happened to be there not planned and just realized that nothing to see
9302,5, It looks quiet due to Corona but it is still a friendly place with many places to go and things to see 
9303,5,Cosmetics heaven for ladies best discountsMust visit in Seoul for shopping
9304,5, Its free because of covid 19 Its really nice to walk around Myeongdong Cathedral for a while 
9305,4, Clearly a lot of business areas have died since the pandemic I hope it will end soon and the streets will be lively 
9306,5, Myeongdong Street No1 We hope that we will soon be free from corona and ultramicrons and show a lively appearance 
9307,5,Probably my favorite part of Seoul You can leave me here for a day and Id be OK  Tons of streetfood choices Cheesy grilled scallops candied Strawberries red bean pancakes theyve got it all My o ly regret is that I shouldve made 
9308,4, The number of shops and customers decreased a lot due to the corona but I am glad that it seems to be coming back little by little My favorite Myeongdong Kyoja here is still good business 
9309,4, It is a pity that the once glamorous street is now quiet 
9310,4,Nice place for hanging out in the evening for shopping or street food hunting Branded stuff and local one are available here From cosmetics to fashion
9311,5,So much has changed due to COVID19 but this place is still iconic and special somewhere I always bring visiting friends and newcomers
9312,5, Myeongdong has a lot less people coming and going because of Corona but still It is still Myeongdong 
9313,4, Due to Corona there were fewer people on the street than before and many street shops were closed I look forward to the time when the bustling Myeongdong comes to life again 
9314,5, Damage caused by COVID19 Its sad to see a closed business 
9315,2, The Myeongdong I visited for the first time in 4 years was not the Myeongdong I knew 90 of the market was dead 
9316,3, It seems that the Chinese people dont come so its getting worse and worse 
9317,5,The festivities begin to thrive
9318,3, A town full of for leases  Now even if I go the bitterness remains rather than the joy 
9319,1, A holiday street in Myeongdong that makes you feel intimidated On a street full of foreigners and lively there are a few poor food stalls and empty buildings looking for rentals adding to the eulsans charm 
9320,1, Its completely ruined 80 seems to be ruined Its worth taking a look at it for a different purpose 
9321,5, I could feel why Myeongdong is a representative tourist attraction in Seoul In a time when everyone is having a hard time with the corona virus Myeongdong is full of people 
9322,2, Myeongdong was hit by the direct hit of Corona 19 so there were too many empty stores and there were few people so it felt like an old man 
9323,5, Oh my gosh I went Its not the old Myeongdong you are so quiet 
9324,3, I went to Myeongdong Cathedral I was walking down Myeongdong street as I was coming and I was passing a clothing store that sold 39000 won shirts for 4900 won I cant climb 
9325,3, Many stores were empty and there were not many people so it was quiet I hope the corona virus will end and we will go back to the old days 
9326,5,There are so many places to eat drink and shop
9327,5,A place where you can easily find what you are looking for
9328,3, Coronas impact is huge More than half of the rental shops are disappointing 
9329,4, I didnt shop in these few this time There were a lot of people when I went so I didnt enter 
9330,4,Still recovering from COVID sparse street vendors
9331,4, The number of people has definitely decreased compared to before In particular I havent seen a single foreigner 
9332,4,Its not quite what it used to be Many of the small shops are out of business due to the lock downs in response to COVID Its still fun to visit clean and has an air of hope that it can return to its former glory
9333,5, I was upset because there were so many empty stores  I visited to remember my 20s 
9334,5, with the corona pandemic Its difficult for foreigners to enter so most of the three stores are closed so its hard to eat 
9335,3, Its sad that there are fewer people on the street than before 
9336,1, Myeongdong which used to be colorful and lively seems to have disappeared 
9337,4,So many shops to go around to Most are skin care shops but there are also convenience stores clothes shops souvenirs street foods shoe shops and money changers 
9338,5,Great
9339,5,Myongdong
9340,5,I feel so sorry who was doing business in myeongdong  Almost 70 shops are closed  Looks like Gosht Street
9341,3, The fortress is quiet Please return to the splendid and rich days of the past 
9342,3, There were a lot of vacancies but there were a few people 
9343,3, Due to the corona virus there are fewer people But still messy 
9344,5, Nowadays there arent too many people 
9345,4,An amazing experience to walk around at the place
9346,2, I felt lonely The glamorous days of the past are colorless 
9347,5, A lot of stores are missingbut the Myeongdong street of memories 
9348,4, I stopped by to eat Myeongdong Kyoja Kalguksu after a long time The splendid and crowded streets of Myeongdong are even saddened as if they 
9349,1, Due to Corona the business district is completely Im sad 
9350,4, Unfortunately Myeongdong has become so lifeless now due to the corona crisis It seems to have changed so much that it has become more of a foreign tourist attraction so when a situation like Corona happens it 
9351,3,emptu
9352,5, There are fewer people than before Corona but it seems to be getting more lively 
9353,5, All facilities and products are good and the quantity is good 
9354,5,Nike
9355,2, Particularly touristy area with shops targeted for them To walk around and discover your first shops the district is interesting However for shopping I particularly advise against The sales techniques are 
9356,5, Seoul Nike is really big and there are plenty of things to see Its enough to spend half a day in a hurry 
9357,5, It is a place where you can feel the aftermath of the corona pandemic Foreign tourists are disappearing and only empty shops are appearing one after 
9358,5, I wish the corona would end soon and it would be crowded 
9359,5,Ideal to buy
9360,3, at the Catholic Hall Had lunch with a friend 
9361,5,this place offers a lot of things from beauty products dress shoes and foods
9362,5,Good to have dinner
9363,5,Amazing for shopping foreigner friendly Now during covid is it almost deserted
9364,3, There are not many street vendors due to a decrease in tourists 
9365,5,The best place in Seoul
9366,5, This is so neat Replying to Jackson 
9367,3, Myeongdong Manhattan Shinjuku 
9368,1, I feel bad because there are a lot of empty shops in the aftermath of the prolonged Corona Myeongdong Kalguksu Gyoja is booming even in Corona and the service at the price is a bakery _ 
9369,5, Myeongdong is one of the largest shopping centers and also one of the main tourist attractions in Seoul City 
9370,5, Hi  The street is very lively there are many foreign tourists cafes restaurants shopping centers Nearby is Myeongdong Cathedral 
9371,3, The streets are quiet and many shops are closed I hope that the corona virus will calm down soon so that it can be transformed into a lively Myeongdong street 
9372,5, Its a street of memories Its a pity that it seems so quiet due to Corona I hope it becomes a lively street again 
9373,5,I
9374,3, Its quiet but its bittersweet to see a 360degree different look from Myeongdong before Its a lonely Myeongdong where there arent any rental letters and the soliciting Chinese have disappeared 
9375,4, Myeongdongs atmosphere but since when did it disappear Merchants struggling with expensive rents cheer up 
9376,5,Also another nice place to visit when in Korea alot of shops known brands like Nike tasso a lot of restaurants different cuisine
9377,5, a place full of people The store is empty and full of rental inquiries 
9378,5, Everyone is busy but its nice to see and imitate the way they live beautifully I hope that many people here will be full of laughter If you smile you will be blessed 
9379,5, Corona has been severely impacted However the taste of the restaurants is delicious as it is and it is better because you can eat delicious food to your hearts content without waiting in 
9380,2, Is it because of the corona The foreign market is dead so the streets are empty 
9381,4,COVID killed a lot of the shopping here but it is still worth the trip Nike Rise Seoul is here and its amazing
9382,5, Its clean Its changed a lot There was a demo in the old days 
9383,4, 20210817 Due to Corona there are few people and there are many buildings under construction so it is inconvenient to pass 
9384,5, Its been a while since Myeongdong The atmosphere wasnt the same as before but it was still good It was fun such as shopping for a movie marathon 
9385,5, May the fame of the old Myeongdong be restored as soon as possible 
9386,1, Myeongdong Seoul the capital of Korea used to be a street where people moved together brightly and with one heart 
9387,3, Shopping street There are a lot of shops that are closed due to Corona 
9388,3, Its because of Corona There are Taegeuk Stars and Stripes Grandpas Its crazy and the atmosphere is bad 
9389,5, Aroma Forest a perfume studio in Noon Square cgv in Myeongdong Crazy cost performance tearful cost performance Its best A place where you can taste 65 products representing 30 brands including Jo Malone 
9390,3, It was good that I didnt squeak as much as I used to There are more places that are closed than expected 
9391,5, It was good Of course it was better before Corona 19 but 
9392,5, The quiet Myeongdong street feels awkward Im sorry to the merchants but personally I think its safer and better for family members to visit and shop Sorry for the individualism ;; 
9393,5, The hustle and bustle of the past is a barrenness that cannot be found at all All of this is probably because of Mr Gnomu Ko The sound of the shutter door coming down early can be heard as the sighs of the 
9394,1, The economy is bad so there are a lot of vacant rental buildings bad looking 
9395,1,The fake president moon jae in is completely failing in covid 19 and fxcking up this place as other parts of Korea
9396,5, Sometimes I go to get my hair cut but these days its hard because of Corona 
9397,3, A street where it is hard to find a characteristic anymore TT 
9398,5, I dont know if I can say this because there are so many empty stores here and there but there are no street vendors so the road is pleasant and there are no Chinese so its quiet on a Saturday afternoon 
9399,4, A devastated downtown Seoul where foreigners have disappeared 
9400,3, Its open until 10 so the lights are off so I wanted to eat yakitori so I went and drank a drink at the convenience store and came back 
9401,1, Myeongdong street seems to be difficult to revive now Myeongdong how did it happen 
9402,5, The wellorganized Myeongdong street in Seoul is a representative street that Korea is proud of 
9403,3, When I go in the morning I feel like an Eulsi year 30 of the stores are closed due to bankruptcy 
9404,5,A lot of the stores are closed now but still has some cute shops and cafs
9405,5, Great place for shopping   Lots of people  many foreigners 
9406,4, There are no foreign fortresses so its good to wander around 
9407,5, I hated the Myeongdong commercial area because of the overpriced prices but now it has become a place of memories that I cant see even if I want to see it 
9408,5,Perfect for shopping eating and having fun
9409,4, Its sad to see how many shops and restaurants have been closed due to Corona I hope everything will bloom again after Corona As before 
9410,4, All the shops are dead so there are many empty shops Its better than when I came last winter However it is still a long way from being active 
9411,4, I hope the corona will end and there will be more people again there are a lot of vacancies 
9412,5, It was bustling and there were various things to see but it was too quiet 
9413,1, Its so slow my heart hurts The first floor of the mall is almost out of business 
9414,4,Hope it will survive the pandemic and revive
9415,4, Now that its Wuhan Corona there arent many people so its a good place to go so I recommend it 
9416,5, where I always went It is a pity that many stores have recently closed due to the corona virus May it be restored to its former fame 
9417,5, now clean and nice Its a pity that there are many vacancies but there are no messy stalls so its very comfortable 
9418,3, Ah Myeongdong Can you find your past again I was shocked to see Myeongdong which is less crowded 
9419,4, Large outdoor shopping area For a long time due to covid there were very few people coming to shop but recently there have been customers and many shops have reopened 
9420,5, There arent that many people so it seems like a good shopping experience 
9421,5, I want to get back to the bustling Myeongdong as the corona ends soon Everyone do your best 
9422,4,Not crowded
9423,4, Its not like before 2019 covid The main consumers are tourists from China or Southeast Asia but tourists cant find them even after washing their eyes As it is the center of the Republic of Seoul it has 
9424,5,Theres a lot of street food varian Theres also shopping centre restaurants minimarket So crowded and beautiful at night
9425,5, Seouls tourist attraction It is good for shopping or for a date because there are many restaurants nearby It is good to visit Namsan or Cheonggyecheon near Myeongdong together 
9426,5,guys
9427,5,great
9428,4, Myeongdong street without foreign tourists is a strange feeling 
9429,1, I dont see any move to winwin by lowering the rent even in the lowkey games It will survive only when various tenants come in at a low price 
9430,5, There is an exhibition and a library People are also wonderful 
9431,4, There are more people again It is comfortable and good when buying things 
9432,3,few people
9433,2, It was so sad that there were so many empty streets with corona and shops with rental signs 
9434,5, Its always a lively place There are also many foods 
9435,5, My heart hurts to see Myeongdong which has grown like this 
9436,5, It was regrettable that the streets of Myeongdong Shopping were empty in several places The selfemployed people were difficult to hang out with expensive stores It was a good thing that it was not busy without 
9437,3, These days it has been closed a lot because of corona 
9438,3, I was too busy because of the aftermath of the corona If you look forward to it you might be disappointed 
9439,3, Due to Covid19 the former center of Seoul collapsed and I was able to feel the pain of businessmen there 
9440,5,1 shopping district for foreigners
9441,5, I visited the animation center in Myeongdong for the second time today because I love it so much It is a place where you can see all kinds of comic books and feel the history of comics so it is completely and 
9442,5, I dont have a street vendor so I just walk but if the Corona is caught quickly 
9443,3, The bustle of the past has disappeared due to a disease called Corona but it is more crowded than other bustling streets The inside of the stores that are on sale is more intense on consumption than the distance 
9444,3, I was a little disappointed There are a lot of Mundedungot 
9445,2, All the shopping malls on the first floor are on lease 
9446,3, The ice cream is thirty centinchin but its big and delicious 
9447,3, The taste is always good even if you go often People are also full 
9448,3, Its dirty because the skewers cups plates and trash that the Chinese bought at the stalls are littered and thrown away 
9449,4, Its good because its busy Its not as crowded as before 
9450,4,There are few stores
9451,5,Lively street loads to see and do Great variety of street food yummy 
9452,5, Compared to before it has become very busy and there are many shops that are closed Please go after confirming whether the business is closed 
9453,3, There are a lot of places closed by corona So quiet 
9454,3,A shopping street that is now very few people walking
9455,4,You would love this place even more if you like shopping for makeup and skin care products
9456,5,Nice and Cozy
9457,5,Prepare to empty your pockets for delicious street food
9458,5,perfect for cosmetics shopping and nice place for tourism
9459,2, There is a lot of empty shopping streets everywhere and its ugly 
9460,5,Though its not as vibrant due to Covid19  this is a fun street to explore and to go shopping
9461,5, There are not many people and the store is closed a lot but there are still many things to see and the Myeongdong Cathedral that you can see at night is very cool 
9462,4, Come back after a long time Taste that doesnt fail your expectations 
9463,1, Too far away Lonely 
9464,4, I visited while reminiscent of old memories but it was unfortunate that tourists disappeared due to corona and many shops were closed 
9465,4, On the afternoon of January 16 2019 day4 Myeongdong a good place for shopping 
9466,3,More and more stores are closes There are not more people like before HM closed it 2nd branch there So poor From last 3 months observing i can say that ZARA HM stopped using their discount sales
9467,3, There are fewer people than in the past Previously there were many Chinese and Japanese people and they were also crowded 
9468,3, 1 Due to the corona pendemic it is difficult to find the same vitality as the old fame 2 Many shops are closed even on weekends 
9469,4, This is a regrettable street because its too busy with corona these days 
9470,5,Cosmetics stores are almost gone because of Corona and there are not many people
9471,5, This is a place with lots of snacks and entertainment If you come with friends or family its perfect 
9472,5,If you want to buy something must visit myeongdong You can find different brands over there
9473,4, It is regrettable that there are not many people in Corona and there are not so many foods as before 
9474,2, I wish the street food was all dead Once you die the price going crazy will be a little normalized 
9475,5, After the corona crisis the floating population drastically decreased 
9476,5, There are many places to see and eat If you are a traveler Myeongdong Korea is a must 
9477,5, I ate the magical crepe souffle cake out of the street food 
9478,5, There are not many people and there are not many Munyeon stores I couldnt believe it was Myeongdong Street Department store There were many cosmetics stores not open to large stores 
9479,2, It is very different from the old Myeongdong Street It is quiet there are not many foreigners and many stores are closed 
9480,5, Thanks to the corona there is no Chinese so it is comfortable and good On the other hand it hurts to see a lot of business districts dying because of 
9481,3, I have always been to Myeongdong at the end of the year and New Year since I was a child but the lively street has become a busy neighborhood due to his corona 
9482,3, Myeongdong is a famous business district in Seoul South Korea Located to the north of the Han River close to Namdaemun Market it is administratively under the jurisdiction of Myeongdong There are many small 
9483,4, It was quiet because it was Corona Ive never seen such a quiet street in Myeongdong 
9484,5,Excelent Commercial grocery market
9485,5, There are many shopping malls closed due to the influence of Corona 19 It is a weekend but there are really no people 
9486,5,One of my favorite things to do when I visit another country is to simply walk around check out the stores and observe the culture Just like most other places in Seoul it is more lively at night
9487,2, Can you realize that it has changed like a ghost city The Corona 19 virus made Myeongdong sick too 
9488,4,soso
9489,4,There are no people in the aftermath of the corona
9490,5, Is this Myeongdong right Because of the corona there are few and quiet people There was a lot less to see but 
9491,5,Loved it everything there
9492,4, Shops here and there Byeolmadang Library There are many things to see and many things to buy 
9493,3, First of all the Starfield shopping mall below has no food to eat and the road is difficult all roads lead to the Starfield library It took me over 25 minutes to find a restaurant I knew in advance haha It can 
9494,3, Visit to attend a seminar It was very difficult to eat lunch 
9495,4,A large mall with a cool library Quite many stores but the layout is a bit confusing
9496,4, Its a place I go to often so its okay and good Parking is a bit expensive 
9497,5, Very very large shopping center with all kinds of things in it 
9498,4,too many people
9499,4,huge shopping mall with library lots of shops restaurants cafes cinema and aquarium
9500,5,For the library
9501,4,liked the fact it was huge not much to shop here though but worth a look around
9502,5,This mall is AMAZING Its all underground and there are so many amazing stores We loved the Starfield library and the Aquarium They have a mega box movie theater too and a really nice food court Its incredibly clean as well
9503,5,Large mall with the impressive Starfield Library located in heart of seoul This mall is connected the Samseong Station on Seoul Metro Line 2 and Bongeunsa Station on Seoul Metro Line 9 Gorgeous and overwhelming Combination of fashion 
9504,3, The parking lot is wide but that could be a disadvantage It is difficult to find a parking location and even to find a destination after parking it seems to be getting more and more inconvenient than the old COEX 
9505,5,Great mall with many restaurants Its attached to Intercontinental Seoul Parnas
9506,5,good
9507,5,Excellent Mall in the neighborhood Gangnam
9508,5,Sweet mall suitable for walking
9509,3, Lunch before viewing Starfield COEX Mall Photo  Video Exhibition Saboten Seafood Katsu Black Pork Katsu Cold Soba 
9510,5, I recommend Byeolmadang A paradise for shopping where you can buy a lot of books and anything You can get on Line 2 right away and there are lots of delicious food 
9511,4, Even if it is a little complicated it is a complex cultural facility that is cooler than the outdoors and can do almost everything 
9512,5,Good place to take a stroll
9513,5, The road was painted in blue on the floor so it was easy to move 
9514,4, visit to Confucianism  I was aiming for a parking discount but it was already sold out due to 
9515,4, Its also Starfield good 
9516,3, All right What is the evaluation Complex crowded undergrounddont go these days 
9517,5, Lots of things to see and do They even laid out a blue carpet to keep you from getting lost these days 
9518,4, As a single shopping mall it is good to have a large size and a lot of food to see 
9519,5, I visited COEX in Samseongdong on a business trip and it was good 
9520,3, A place where you go expecting something special but when you go there you dont have a special experience 
9521,4,Definitely a must see Theres a Starbucks as you enter so you can grab a coffee and read a book The library gets really busy so go early if you was a window seat 
9522,5,This very big mall and also has many tourist attractions like Starfield Library and Coex Aquarium This place is perfect for shopping eat play and enjoy
9523,5, clean and comfortable There are many brands and the store is spacious There are also quite a few restaurants 
9524,4, The air conditioner is not cool these days but there is nothing like it in terms of multishopping 
9525,5, I bought a dress at a clothing store and I am satisfied with both the quality and the price But it is too hot in COEX But the InterContinental Hotel Caf is cool The air is different 
9526,5,numerous books to love at
9527,5,Love the ambient of this place Whenever you are in Seoul try to spend sometime here
9528,4, A place where you can have a date comfortably on a hot summer day But too many people 
9529,4, Its good except for the hard to find Everything is really there 
9530,4, Its nice to have a place where you can use Shinsegae gift vouchers 
9531,5,Always the best place to see cute penguins
9532,4,Muy lindo lugar
9533,3, The positioning of COEX is quite ambiguous It lacks a lot compared to its competitors 
9534,5,The mall was very lively with the stores and people but I went in for the library everyone talks aboutbut I must say Im disappointed considering the tiny number of books in English over there I had bigger expectations I guess
9535,5,You find all sorts of food here Good to have an exhibition at Coex so that youll have plenty of time to shop at the mall
9536,5, There is no place like COEX in hot and rainy weather like these days 
9537,5, A place worth visiting once All the restaurants you want to go to 
9538,5,Such a gorgeous mall Its very big which is slightly overwhelming but I enjoyed all the options Stores seem to close around 9930PM but you can find some restaurants that stay open later
9539,3,outdated mall
9540,5,I like visit here
9541,5, There are quite a lot of pretty things on sale even though the clothes below are cheap If you come to buy clothes youll be fine Most of the restaurant corners are delicious but because its Gangnam there are a 
9542,5,Very lovely and well organised place
9543,4,Space okay
9544,3, Holiday parking is a bit crowded and there are a lot of people I stopped by because there is a hoka store for mountaineering equipment but it is difficult to secure a quantity these days so it is better to check 
9545,4, It feels much brighter and cleaner But I still need to fill it up more so one point is deducted 
9546,5,Tem muitas opes de restaurantes e de lojas Alm disso tem um cinema muito grande e  tudo muito limpo e agradvel
9547,5,Oh I loved this place and its because of the way how they kept All of the Corona virus rules
9548,5,Large mall with the impressive Starfield Library A visit is definitely worthwhile because of the library In addition to the usual shops there is also a large food court
9549,5, Andong steamed chicken restaurant in COEX Mall it was yummy 
9550,5,Free books to read
9551,4, Except for the Starfield Library there are not that many interesting shops and the shopping center itself is rather uncomfortable and confusing 
9552,4, Now that Corona is over it is a place where people will pass like a wave There are many experiences and things to see and it is the best place to shop for food at once 
9553,5,Well planned events centre
9554,5, It was nice that the blue road was marked to make it easier to find the Byeolmadanggil 
9555,4, I went to Samsung Coex Megabox to see a movie Ive had a lot of fun watching it The movie is called Crime City 2 
9556,3,Its a great place but somehow really overrated On most pictures it looks like its a huge library which it isnt in my opinion Was a bit disappointed once I got there
9557,1, Its hard to find a way I dont really want to shop here 
9558,5,Largest underground mall in the world
9559,5, Overall good Bitterness in the slump in dutyfree shops 
9560,5, Its crowded but everything is there and the location is great so its a good place to hang out with friends 
9561,5,Nice
9562,5, The road is busy these days due to underground construction 
9563,5,Good
9564,5, There are EMart Traders and there is also EMart  There is even Costco so it is a good place to go shopping 
9565,5,Beautiful library
9566,5,Strong shopping mall
9567,4, There are a lot of people at lunchtime All the restaurants are waiting 
9568,5,Starfield Library was my highlight
9569,5,Impressive Bookstore I loved
9570,5,My favorite mall and my favorite shopping experience in Seoul and I tried so many It has fancy shops for Teens Twens and classy shops for the more serious of us Its huge I couldnt manage to see all stores and of course I couldnt eat at all restaurants I guess you can spend two days there if you want
9571,4, always good The road is complicated but you can check it through a map in the middle Good for shopping complex 
9572,5,I brought my visiting friend here for shopping and coffeethe Starfield library is perfect for picturesj
9573,4,Complete mall The onsite library is worth visiting
9574,5, Steak  Reservation  Family gathering on my husbands birthday  This is the best meal Tbone Steak They even give me bread when I come home  I think of steak I ate in the 
9575,5,Beautiful place
9576,5, What you always remember when you go to COEX mall is the open library area There are various books here and of course you are welcome to read them Not only that there is also an SMTOWN museum here so you can see 
9577,4,Gigantic
9578,4,A lot of things to do and see
9579,5, Its complicated enough to have to look at the map in advance 
9580,5,A really large mall that connects 2 subway stations Bongeunsa and Samseong although the library is nearer to the Samseong side Lots of upscale shops and brands in the mall but the draw of this place is the huge librarybookstore in the middle Worth a visit
9581,5, Good shopping infrastructure as it is with the exhibition hall Directly connected to the subway station 
9582,5, Its clean and there are plenty of places to eat so its good for a date or exercise 
9583,5, A place to hang out and play when you go to see an exhibition in COEX Byeolmadang library recommended 
9584,4,Good
9585,4, Some of the intestines are included so those who do not like fishy or scented products may not like it Visually you can say what is this 
9586,5,the library in this Mall is beautiful
9587,4, The composition is not good The food courts are all scattered There are not many shops worth shopping 
9588,5, Nobrand burger I was a little reluctant to say nobrand at first but now the costeffectiveness is really good A full and filling burger I really ate it to my full stomach 
9589,5, open library where everyone can stay 
9590,4, I liked it a lot although there were a lot of people but everything is very nice 
9591,4, Among the Starfields it is impressive that it is small and decorated like a track 
9592,3, It seems to be a little smaller than Hanam it is a weekday so you can shop quietly and the professionalism of the staff seems to be a bit low 
9593,4, Architecture of balance and shape A place that maintains the formativeness while stably catching the center of gravity despite the harmonious architecture of several buildings 
9594,5, Its really good if you like to read books If youre tired and tired of reading books there are many cafes in COEX so its good to go to quench your thirst and unwind 
9595,4, In 2016 when Starfield of Shinsegae was built the name was changed to Starfield COEX Mall 
9596,5, This incredible Plaza and within it is an incredible library 
9597,3, Its a large indoor shopping mall with everything prepared Its a bit complicated but I go there often because I can walk around regardless of the weather 
9598,5, I went to the IFS Franchise Fair It is a space where various convention events are operated in a large space 
9599,4, Its always messy but its convenient because you can enjoy it in one stop 
9600,5, The Net Beauty Library a mustsee attraction in Seoul is very easy to photograph 
9601,4,Went there for the Library and was not disappointed
9602,5,Lots of shops and great place overall Great place to look around and sightsee
9603,5, In particular Starfield is very pretty Lots to see and eat 
9604,4, It is a place to go if there is an exhibition but the shopping is also good 
9605,4, Starfield has changed a lot from the old COEX Mall The Starfield Library is too far away 
9606,4,I  enjoyed shopping here Prices are quite standard
9607,5, Every time I go its great First of all it is spacious diverse and fun 
9608,5, It was very difficult after the opening of Lotte World Tower Mall but it seems to have improved a lot after Shinsegae started operating 
9609,4, I got married at COEX but every time I visit I get confused 
9610,2, The space arrangement is inefficient and it is difficult to guide the way inside You think it has to be complicated so that people stay and shop in that maze 
9611,5, Too wide and too complicated I get lost every time I go Please take a look at the middlemiddle map 
9612,5, It is a mustvisit place to visit when visiting Seoul It has many stores and events constantly taking place indoors and outdoors 
9613,3, Visited to see Seoul Living Design Fair The entrance fee was not worth it The parking fee was too high so it was a bit pricey 
9614,4,Interesting Huge bookstore
9615,5,Worth every second spent here Its too beautiful to capture or describe in words
9616,4, Because the location is a location its good except for the price 
9617,4, There were many things to eat and to report so it was not good New stores are created and the changing trend is becoming more and more diversified 
9618,4, Ant Hell Shopping Center Unfortunately there is no special restaurant 
9619,5, I love this place There is so much here and everything is firstclass and creative 
9620,5, Its nice to have all the restaurants and shopping malls together 
9621,5, Pleasant shopping environment Friendly staff clean toilet 
9622,4, It seems to have been renewed and somewhat complicated and expensive but it is still a famous landmark As the Byeolmadang Library became famous along with the COEX Exhibition Center it seems that it is easier to 
9623,5, Nice facilities and neat interior very good 
9624,3, Its a pity that the underground shopping mall is going to run rampant with Corona 
9625,5,Excellent place in Seoul to chill hangout shopping and eating The great attraction giant screen and high rise modern building Definitely see the Gangnam Style and the sculpture hand gesture Why late  Its time to go and enjoy
9626,5, Was impressed by the mall everything your heart desires was there 
9627,3, Visit the DongA Exhibition on the 2nd floor of COEX Its like an exhibition for business purposes 
9628,5, It is the best place for an appointment There are also electrical outlets at the table Enter COEX Mall right away 
9629,5, Its been a while since Ive visited Its been a while but the clean facilities were good 
9630,5, Shopping was fun and I was able to see various events and exhibitions so I had a good time I want to go again 
9631,5, Friendly and convenient work is fast 
9632,5, shopping paradise Hokaone One 1st Store Nice 
9633,5, The building of COEX in Seoul is about 500 pyeong or about 520 pyeong Its pretty wide which is nice 
9634,4, A large complex distribution store located between the underground bears connected to Samseong Station and Bongeunsa Station 
9635,4, As it expanded the number of shops increased but the circulation became more complicated and the ceiling was low and it felt like a subway station 
9636,5,Its cool there but parking is very expensive
9637,3,So much to do and see but not much shopping even tho there r tons of shops
9638,5, At Coex Plaza we can buy clothes sweaters household needs etc at several shops at a reasonable price not much different from in Jakarta Like Uniqlo the price is not much different I like to buy a discount is 
9639,5, It was disappointing that the food court usually opens from 11 am 
9640,5, Its good to go on a date because its good to see the aquarium and there are many restaurants Its also nice to bring kids It is conveniently connected to the subway line 2 and line 9 
9641,5, The facilities are pretty there are many things to see and lots of fun places 
9642,4, There were a lot of people and it was big enough to get tired of walking around but I did not get lost in the neat and easytorecognize navigation system unique to Korea 
9643,3,Large indoormall
9644,5, A place worth visiting without explanation Its a problem if you get lost sometimes 
9645,5,Of course it is a 5 star for anywhere you can bring your dog Everything you need in a mid level mail Decathlon is a favorite for sporting goods
9646,5,Can be tough to navigate but only because of the size
9647,5,very beautiful
9648,5, See exhibitions shop and eat Today was a very cold day so it was better 
9649,2, not recommended Both the street and the entrance are far and deep Its just that there is a small hall in the middle of the hallway inside COEX 
9650,4, Once you go you can get lost Occasionally maps and navigation monitors are installed The restaurant also has snacks hamburgers steaks and Japanese specialties But at events and such it is almost full You can 
9651,5, I went to an art show A day in which I also develop one step further with many works 
9652,5,Fantastic
9653,5, cold Bangkok is also good but if you have completed the 2nd vaccination go out 
9654,5, Byeolmadang library was very good The staff at the VR experience center were friendly and it was great to donate 
9655,5, There are so many people so many places to see and so many places to eat 
9656,3, There seems to be a lack of goods in the mall and the quality of the product is lacking anyway There are many places that are closed 
9657,5, There are many places to shop with a clean and easytoshopping circulation 
9658,5, Its a good place with plenty of space including the unquestionable Byeolmadang Library CJ Food World clothing stores and restaurants as well as cafes and franchise burger shops I hope you call me sometime during 
9659,5,One of the best shopping mall in Korea Also suitable for dating and entertaining
9660,5, There are a lot of people and they do a good job so there are a lot of eye candy 
9661,3,Maze  easy to get lost
9662,3,Good mall
9663,5,Full range of famous products
9664,4, I made the kids look good I wish there was a bigger aquarium 
9665,5,Great place
9666,5,Super beautiful bookstore
9667,5, Starfield added after renewal And Byeolmadang Library Koreas first opentype library grand and wonderful 
9668,4, Location convenience and friendly guidance are all good but the parking fee is expensive 
9669,5, Although it is old it is well maintained and there are many facilities that children will love such as a library and an aquarium 
9670,1, Its clean but Ive seen a lot of people not following the quarantine rules 
9671,5, Did you eat delicious food watch a movie shop and now you are done 
9672,5,Cool
9673,5, It is good that there is a space where you can read a book comfortably in the center of COEX Mall 
9674,5, A place where trends meals and encounters are all resolved 
9675,5,Great place for sightseeing shopping and just spending time with books coffee and friends
9676,4, Parking is expensive so I buy a Kakao T oneday pass every time I go in The 50 discount for the exhibition is 24000 won for a oneday parking ticket but you can purchase a daily ticket for Kakao T at 18000 won 
9677,5, I like that COEX is very big and the clothes are all so pretty 
9678,4, Families of young lovers  Shopping regardless of gender and age 
9679,3, Tastes good but expensive Its like the name of COEX Please note that parking is expensive 
9680,5, National Museum of Korea special exhibition a collectors invitation I couldnt get a ticket so I went with an onsite ticket It opens at 10am but 
9681,5, It was nice to be able to easily recognize the ancient modern and modern times of Korea by being displayed and categorized by parts 
9682,5, Interesting place a lot of exhibits you can buy souvenirs inside 
9683,5, I didnt expect it But it was so good Its pretty good and Ill be back again 
9684,5, A place where you can see the largest history Time to enjoy the cool and admire the wisdom of our ancestors 
9685,5, I only came once and couldnt get a good look  It is recommended to come several times and see each area 
9686,5, I love the childrens museum Its so small you can see it all in time I think its good for ages 6 and up 
9687,5, It was a pity that I couldnt hear the commentary because the children were free to watch 
9688,5, It was a journey through time and space as if I had personally visited the site in history 
9689,5,The museum is enormous be sure to arrive early there I spent 4 hours inside and still didnt see everything By the way I went to Gyeongju right after visiting the museum so it felt like a school field trip if you have the opportunity I highly recommend you to do that
9690,5, The relics inside were amazing and I was particularly impressed with the Banga Thought Event 
9691,5, It was nice to see the masterpieces of Lee Kunhees exclusive artist 
9692,5, I came here to see the Geunee Collection but it was good to capture the concept and tell the story visually and audio instead of just displaying items 
9693,5, Its been a long time since Ive visited but it was also very helpful and good 
9694,4,Preferred the War memorial since it felt more relevant Still great for a free museum though
9695,5, I cant see many at once Guess Ill have to go there more often 
9696,5, There was a lot to see and it was clean and well maintained I did a docent tour and hearing the commentary made the museum tour two or three times more interesting We recommend that both children and adults visit 
9697,5, It is also a representative museum in Korea I have seen wonderful special exhibitions in a pleasant indoor air 
9698,4,Nice museum  Family friendly
9699,5,Another must see in Seoul
9700,5, There were historical objects in the museum so I was able to understand them well Aztec special exhibition Silla Joseon etc were displayed beautifully

9876,4, Clean and well made The digital cinema is really good I sat there without even taking a picture  I went to Asteca before and it was fun 
9877,5, You can see various cultures and see the cultural relics donated by donors 
9878,5, Although it is known for various famous exhibitions the exterior and interior landscaping provide a resting place for citizens and tourists It is a pleasantly decorated place such as an artificial waterfall pond

9893,5, Truly a treasure trove It seems that all our national treasures are here

9904,5, that the design of the building is a museum scenery that makes you feel The beauty of the moon jar on the 3rd floor 
9905,5, Its a bit far from the subway station but if you take the bus it stops right in front There is a taxi stop but it has no meaning so I recommend a call taxi when you 
9906,5, People who moved the sun Go to the Aztec exhibition and see the pictures of peoples lives and customs in the past 
9907,5, It was so good The building itself was like an exhibition because it was beautiful The temperature and humidity were very comfortable spacious and neat and it was nice to be able to see the objects of Goryeo 
9908,5, This is my first visit while living in Seoul I am grateful that such a large and wonderful museum exists in Korea 
9909,5, The best museum in Korea It is a museum to be proud of as much as Levre Museum 
9910,5, I went to the Lee Kunhee collection held in the special exhibition room 
9911,5, I am moved to see the incredibly wonderful and precious relics if you go here for free It was a bit disappointing that I couldnt see the giltbronze incense burner 
9912,5, Its a good place to go anytime but Ive been here for a long time to see the Aztec exhibition When the weather is nice I rest a lot on a bench by the pond after watching the exhibition 
9913,5, The worldclass National Museum of Korea I also like the planned exhibitions 
9914,5, nice work nice display to a peaceful atmosphere

9920,5, The National Museum of Korea is welldecorated as a place for experiential learning for families lovers and students

9922,5, The exhibition space is spacious Outdoor walking trails are also good Anytime is good 
9923,5, The media hall was new and good in the permanent exhibition hall There is a large outdoor area for walking and there is also a childrens museum 
9924,5,Exqisite exhibits and great amenities
9925,5, It is one of the best museums managed in Korea Although it is free it is the cleanest and the best size The parking lot is spacious and convenient 
9926,4, The view of Namsan in the middle of the building was impressive All the artifacts inside the museum are full of bowls so I subtracted one star 
9927,5, VR experience with children watching the real thing and watching documentaries It is better to understand 
9928,5, I think it would be better to go to the Lee Kunhee Art Exhibition after making a reservation online 
9929,5, I went to a collectors invitation exhibition 1st anniversary of the Lee Kunhee Collection I bought it on the spot and arrived at 1 oclock but I was able to buy a 3 ticket so I ate and drank coffee in the yard 
9930,5, Its a really nice place It is so spacious that you need to plan ahead if you want to see it all in one day 
9931,5, on a huge scale Visiting a museum with a lot to see always nice 
9932,5, After a long time in the education room of the Central National Crop Center There is a general meeting of the National Literature Museum so you can take 
9933,3, Ive seen King Taejo and King Yeongjo and I dont remember much about the details of King Taejo of Goryeo during the Silla period 
9934,5, Its close to my house so I often go for a walk There are benches all over the outdoor space so you can enjoy a cup of coffee while looking at the scenery 
9935,5, It would be nice if there was a regular cultural heritage commentary 
9936,5, It is located in the basement of Lotte World Shopping Mall 2 and is easily accessible by getting off line 8 It is convenient as it has a restaurant on the basement floor and a shopping aquarium in one place 
9937,5, Aquarium is always fun Until the end with a seal on top 
9938,3, Its honestly disappointing compared to the scale of the building Its small 
9939,5,Just awesome with beluga
9940,5, It was nice to walk around coolly in the summer so there were a lot of people 
9941,2, childrens favorite place Its too bad because there are too many people Because its vacation the kids 
9942,5, Parking takes a while since its the weekend Even in summer the inside is cool It is spacious and there are many kinds to see 
9943,5,Excellent plan to come with friends or family Very beautiful and organized and its not expensive We paid 28 euros for 2 tickets
9944,4, The downside is that parking is expensive everything else was good 
9945,1, Feels like a mall in a small space It seems that the separation of space by theme is a bit lacking short of money 
9946,5,The aquarium was a wonderful experience Lots of different species to look through Had a good time
9947,4, It was difficult because there were too many people Its worth going but you shouldnt go with too big a fantasy 
9948,1, The space is too small for the size of the fish In particular the space where the sea lion show was performed seemed like a harsher space for sea lions 
9949,5,It was a magical timethe animals all seemed to be happy too
9950,5,Wonderful 
9951,5,Surprised by the Aquarium Was a little packed to start but the Beluga whale was very cool to see
9952,4, Its hard to see even a 4 star beluga because of the lack of manatee 
9953,5,Children like each other very much
9954,5, It was because there were a lot of people but I had so much fun playing with my children 
9955,4, It was a weekday and there were so many people But the kids liked it and had a lot of fun Especially the otter beluga and stingray are so cute 
9956,4, Good to go with kids 0801 Mon There were a lot of people Most of the visitors were families with strollers and children 
9957,5, Hello  I am disabled I went to the aquarium in Seoul Jamsil Station with my brother it was strange really good from 2021 July 19 to 2022 7 19 Look good 
9958,3, There are really too many people haha The fish are so amazing but there are too many people 
9959,1, Babies are all on the display frame and they are rich and lowreachingI have been watching all the children from all over the countryI will not visit again 
9960,4, It would be nice if there was a plan for activation such as consideration for visitors and events 
9961,1, I hope they pay more attention to comfort and consideration for visitors 
9962,2, not large in size Even on weekdays there are many children screaming or running around but parents do not stop them I was watching with my children in front of the aquarium first but I saw a group of strange 
9963,5, Yesterday from Busan to Yongin The beauty of Jamsil Lotte Aquarium To the mystery of indoor aquarium creatures 
9964,3, It was good It was good There are too many mites Its okay to go as a couple 
9965,4,Really crowded but it was beautiful
9966,5, You have to see Beluga from downstairs 
9967,4, Very nice and friendly aquarium well signposted cjemin spread over 3 floors if I remember correctly But even though it was amazing to see a narwhal it needs more space 
9968,4, Beluga is so cute It makes me feel comfortable just sitting and watching 
9969,5, There are dolphins beluga whales and experiences so there are plenty of things to see 
9970,4, Very good But half a water person haha I am willing to visit again later 
9971,2, I thought I was going to have claustrophobia because there were so many people 
9972,1, Too many people even though there are too many Im really lost I think it would be better to limit the number of entries 
9973,4, Well decorated Compared to other aquariums I personally think its better 
9974,2, No fish Beluga is pretty but she looks lonely I will never go again 
9975,5,Nice place and variety of items
9976,5,Nice place to enjoy with the family
9977,4,This is a very nice place to visit with your family You can probably spend about 34 hours with your family if you let your kids play as they want in their play areas I live a few hours away from Monterey Bay aquarium and Ive visited it 
9978,5,Ok
9979,5,Large aquarium with diverse habitats and displays  Beluga Whale was in a good mood today and interacting with visitors
9980,5,Convenient location when combined with Lotte World Great discounts for foreigners Customer service is excellent The aquarium is phenomenal
9981,5,Aquarium in the mall nice
9982,5, There are many things to see and it was especially nice to meet a pretty beluga 
9983,5,So good 
9984,5,Best place for family with kids
9985,2, Weekend visits are more peoplewatching than fish  It was decorated nicely and cutely than I expected In particular in the place 
9986,5, mysterious If we become friends with Zeus can we go to a room similar to this 
9987,4, There are various types and the interior facilities are well done  
9988,5,It was an amazing experience visiting Lotte World Aquarium Fish are adorable They make people happy
9989,5, By the way there are places where you can feed them but keep in mind that they are cash only 
9990,5,Best place ever visited so far
9991,4, Lotte Tower Aquarium I went with Lotte Tower Is it bigger than the 63 Building Many young mothers bring their babies in strollers 
9992,5, It was fun but there were a lot of people I havent seen much though 
9993,5,Good   
9994,4,Very nice experience overall
9995,4, Although the overall size is small the large tank is spectacular 
9996,5, There was a lot to see and it was fun to take pictures If you buy a ticket to use the observation deck and the aquarium in one day you can visit it at a slightly cheaper price 
9997,5, Yesterdays school Totogi Aquarium family outing at our school The sun was setting and my mother applied and went yesterday so I went too early and couldnt see my friends so it was an hour and a half away but then 
9998,3, There is less variety than expected The beluga looks good 
9999,5, Its perfect to take with elementary and low graders and kindergarteners Its accessible and easy to get around Except its a weekend so theres a lot of people 
10000,5,Really nice place with friendly personnel Good service
10001,4, There are a lot of events so you can actually enter at a price in the low 20000 won range but since you see everything it feels like the regular price 
10002,5, It is different from the COEX Aquarium Its so good to go with the kids  
10003,5,Rt thch Ngm c nhiu ng vt Chng n rt hi hc 
10004,3, It is the largest among the Seoul Aquariums but it would be nice to see it together with the observatory on a sunny day as a package 
10005,5, Thank you just for seeing the sea animals in the middle of Seoul 
10006,3, composition is good Discount tickets for viewing after 5pm are also good value for money But until there Due to the nature of the location on Sundays parking is difficult from hello 
10007,5,Really amazing I enjoyed every second of the visit  The staff is so friendly and helpful they try to communicate no matter what thats something I appreciate because corean language is very difficult  beautiful but difficult so in this case Ill give them 5 stars and if I could Ill give more 
10008,5,Lots of variety in the exhibits Not the biggest aquarium but such a wonderful diversity in the types of animals and the way they are presented Several places where youre walking through tunnels with sharks rays and fish on all sides; 
10009,4,Good to be with kids
10010,5,Great place
10011,5, It is good to make useful and fun memories with babies At the beginning crocodiles seem too scary for toddlers It is also recommended to skip 
10012,5, Very good is more than aquarium There are a variety of fish including crocodiles bellulas and seals Most of them are organized into small tanks There are water tanks and coral displays as well Wow for a 
10013,3, If its in front of the house its worth visiting once instead of the fishing port 
10014,5,One of my favorite places in the Lotte TowerDepartment Store Doesnt matter how many times you go you will always find somethig new and will enjoy the fish tanks it takes around 2hours to see everything but totally worth it
10015,5, The onsite kiosk family ticket purchase was cheaper than the telecommunication company discount 30 It is unfortunate that Belarus meet 
10016,5, Having a good time with our family Because the child wants to go to the aquarium 
10017,5, The route is inconvenient but its good  The movement line This guys movement line is very inconvenient 
10018,5, By far the best Ive been to lately Children seem to love it There are a lot of people so take that into consideration 
10019,4,Soso
10020,3,Ive been here quite a few times Its nice to see all the sea animals
10021,5, Its a great place to come with kids Beluga and penguins are so cute 
10022,5,Well organised and well maintained aquarium Special zoomin glasses for kids at various sections
10023,3, I went together with the Lotte Tower Observation Deck but I didnt go to an aquarium here and there so it was just that I think a house with children would be fine 
10024,4, I was a little nervous at first I had a lot of fun 
10025,5,Amazing experience
10026,5, hard to get to Comfortable and good after arrival 
10027,5, One of the best aquariums Ive ever been to Parking is not as expensive as I thought 
10028,5, Everyones favorite aquarium both adults and children  There were a lot of people when we went on Childrens Day The kids love the aquarium so they are the older ones but I went to a nearby 
10029,5,Beautiful
10030,5, It was my first time visiting this place and I couldnt help but admire the various fish dancing in the rhythm of the water boasting their beauty 
10031,4, Friendly explanations and a variety of fish Its a place everyone will love regardless of age but there are too many people 
10032,4,I cannot see fish but people
10033,5, When I was a child I enjoyed watching it with my mom 
10034,5, Its a great place to go with a discount Instead it is difficult to see it for a long time and the optimal viewing time is about 3 hours There are also photo zones and lots of cute fish 
10035,4, A great place to go with kids and friends You can get a discount on the parking lot if you use it here They dont give discounts on meals It looks huge but it ends quickly when you turn around  there is a 
10036,5, I was surprised at how large and spacious it was than I expected 
10037,5, There are so many different types and there is a space where children can play There are many photo spots but it was hard but it was fun 
10038,5, I saw a lot of fish and I love taking pictures so its a good date 
10039,3, Other than the white dolphin honestly its better than other aquariums I dont think 
10040,5,Children friendly great fun and  experience
10041,5, If you go too early the otters are sleeping It was impressive to see the penguins flying 
10042,4, I went to see the aquarium with the kids from the Chunghyeon Welfare Center 
10043,5, The water is very clean and there is no fishy smell peculiar to the aquarium There are rare animals such as beluga and sea lion The super large aquarium is really great You can look down from above or look up from 
10044,5, Its good to be able to experience an aquarium nearby Shopping and dining at the same time In particular there are event tickets for 3 or 4 people so it is much better 
10045,4, You can see the aquarium nearby and there are many experience events inside so there are many things to enjoy Inside cafe goods corner photography feeding etc But unfortunately Its not a very large 
10046,5, I saw the fish in the aquarium The enchanting sight I also saw a walking stingray I was moved by how the scuba diver feeds it and eats it with a cute little mouth 
10047,4,Great and beautiful Aquarium the price is ok I think some animals would need a bigger aquarium especially the Beluga Whale
10048,4, Unfortunately there are no sharks otherwise not bad I would like to see more shows 
10049,5,The combined ticket for the aquarium and the tower was 39000kw and was worth it the exit is quite difficult to find haha but still a must see experience
10050,4, It was not big compared to other places but it was good to walk around Parking is easy and there werent many people when it was open 
10051,4, The time to visit is a little shorter than Ilsan or other Hanwha Aquariums but there are a variety of fish species and the beluga trying to communicate with people covers everything At the same time as approaching 
10052,4, Although it is smaller than COEX you can see many living things and the gentle fragrance spreads out giving you a sense of care I was lucky enough to see a beluga and it was a fun and new experience 
10053,4, Its pretty and its a good place to go together Its a pity that the deadline is at 8 
10054,5, If you go on a weekday its honey You can enjoy leisurely 
10055,4,Not a bad aquarium best feature was the seals atleast 3 They would follow light around in circles The whale was also really cool to see Lots of different exhibits pig nose turtles jelly fish eels rock fish and a juvenile crocodile
10056,5, Although it may not be said that the costeffectiveness is good it seems to be enough to show the children at least once 
10057,5, Making memories with my son  studying  happiness  I saw nemowadori 
10058,5, COEX is another attraction I liked the atmosphere and theme If the time is right there are also activities for children to experience 
10059,4, Parking 4800 won for up to 4 hours 500 won for every 10 minutes after that 
10060,4,Bigger than I expected good variety of fish but many of the tanks seem too small for the species of fish or the number
10061,5, Grownups looking for lost dreams Kids can enjoy and enjoy all the fish The penguins I saw last were really cute 
10062,5, If you come during the daytime you can see the feeding and the active fish 
10063,4, facilities are very clean I think its better than any other aquarium But confinement of animals 
10064,4,Its really ocean  world by human
10065,5, It was well maintained and it was so pretty Its a bit sad that I didnt see my beluga friends but Im very satisfied 
10066,5, I went with my mother and child with a ticket The older the child is the more they see and the longer they stay  I think you should extend the parking for 4 hours more 
10067,5, Children really like it and as an adult I also enjoyed it 
10068,5, Its bigger than I thought and there are a lot of babies beluga cute 
10069,5, I canceled the annual membership and went there for a year Almost every weekend I come with my wife and my youngest son and my son likes it every time we come its fun and the annual membership is not wasted I am 
10070,5, beluga is cute Beluga is the best 
10071,4, Great place to spend time with kids With Beluga 
10072,5, It was my first time coming to Jamsil because I dont have any business to visit I thought the aquarium was only in COEX but I wondered what it would be like to say that it is also in Jamsil There is an aquarium 
10073,5,Good place for children
10074,5,It was a lot nicer than I expected Since it was so small I didnt think there would be much to see However there were a lot of sea animals There are stations where you can feed the fish My personal favorite was seeing the beluga 
10075,5, I went to see the beluga There are a lot of neat and pretty marine creatures I was a little tired of waiting for the beluga 
10076,4, There is a lot to see but it is quite dark when you first enter and the place is wide so it is easy to get lost so you can get lost or see what you have already seen People who do not know the road well have the 
10077,5, It was really good I came to the aquarium after a long time but I thought it was good to come and I was so happy It was a good time when I was alone but not lonely at all 
10078,4, kids like it It is best to avoid weekends and holidays too many people 
10079,4, On the weekends it is crowded and crowded Still a great place to spend time with kids 
10080,5, The 2nd visit was also recently made and clean I hope that the beluga whale will be dealt with quickly in good conditions As a tip do not make a reservation in advance 
10081,5, For two people admission is KRW 41000 well done inside Also recommended as a date course Lots of family visitors lots of kids but its fun haha 
10082,1, Expectations are low because it is located in the tallest building in Korea The number of fish species the viewing window and the entrance fee are not 
10083,4, Better than COEX 63 Aquarium Beluga Its a pity It must be frustrating 
10084,5,Awesome
10085,4, Lets go see the beluga Its good to go once If you go twice Doesnt it look like fun 
10086,4, Its really spacious so theres a lot to see If theres one thing I regret it looks lonely because Beluga is alone 
10087,5,Amazing
10088,5, A great place for a long outing with children or lovers The last penguin is so cute 
10089,5, Bigger than I thought so much to see mysterious expensive 
10090,5, Adele and granddaughter Orenman in Busan during Lunar New Year holidays I came to Seoul and went to the Jamsil Aquarium 
10091,4, I thought it would be small but it was so good with colorful things to see The children are happy 
10092,3, I watched it with no expectations so I didnt expect much 
10093,5, I went to the COEX Aquarium about 10 years ago and it was my first time there but youIt was great Previously I thought that the aquarium was a waste of money but I never 
10094,5, I went back after a long time  Compared to before the facilities looked a little outdated and the water inside 
10095,5, More fun for adults than children Its so fun in the sea you dont know how time flies 
10096,2, The aquarium is located in the tallest building in Korea I went with high expectations but it was worse than Ilsan 
10097,5, neatly done It is good to spend about two hours until elementary school students Beluga seals are located in a large area so you can see them moving actively 
10098,3, It is difficult to see because there are too many people on the weekend 
10099,3, Its not very big but there are places to rest Its okay to just take the kids to drink 
10100,5, It is the most active among the aquariums I have been to Beluga seemed to be the least stressed 
10101,4, Its shorter than I thought The size of the aquarium is a bit disappointing 
10102,5, Its been a while since Ive been here and the variety of fish was fun 
10103,5,Very beautiful under ocean life Its located in the Lotte World Mall on B1 level Cost of the ticket is 36000 won as of 20220130 we found a 50 discount coupon for Lunar New Year
10104,4, There is an aquarium near the house so the kids really like it However it is a pity that a separate parking fee is charged and there is not a variety of marine life in the aquarium The aquarium has more colorful 
10105,4, I didnt realize the time was passing because I was watching the fish in the large tank such as beluga and otter penguins and so cute 
10106,5, I went to the aquarium after a long time but it has changed a lot here and there There are still many people on the weekends I had a great time with my kids after a long time 
10107,5, Go to the house with children Its perfect to come down and see the market 
10108,4,Nice place for beat time
10109,4, There are many places to take pictures with children many fish and many things to see 
10110,4, The advantage of Lotte Aquarium is that there is a 4hour discount on parking lots 200 won per 10 minutes and a photo service charged 
10111,4, The water was a little cloudy than before It was a weekday but there were a few people 
10112,5, Some fish Poor Its good haha 
10113,5,Amazing Collection of Sea Creatures and Fishes  Kids would surely love it
10114,5, Penguins favorite place Woo Raegis favorite place Buy an annual membership and take advantage of weekdays 
10115,4,Better than coex aquarium
10116,5, It is a place where you can enjoy a stroll with a baby who has not yet turned into a baby The inside was bigger than I expected and there were various kinds of fish Even though the baby was strange it was in the 
10117,5, good for a date Taking pictures of beluga is harder than I thought 
10118,5, Its good to take my baby along The aquarium is also large and there are many things to see Instead it is expected that it would be better to use weekdays rather than 
10119,5, I got a T membership discount so I went during winter vacation as a child but there were not many people and there were many interesting and pretty fishes so it was fun I got a discount on parking with an 
10120,5, I think it came 5 times Its nice to see a variety of fish species in Seoul If you buy it nearby we recommend an annual pass 
10121,5,Super well maintained place unfortunately due to COVID few activities were not availableworth visiting place when coming to Seoul
10122,5, B1 where the beluga lives Coffee and cafe inside 
10123,5, Aquarium and Seoul Sky in one day After riding the elevator that goes up to the 120th floor in 1 minute the groom and children say that they will not be able to see below 
10124,3, It was good at first but there hasnt been much change in several years and I feel sorry for the beluga 
10125,5, If you want to feel a childlike feeling please come It is also the best as a date course 
10126,4, Much better than rumors  Routes can be a bit confusing 
10127,3, It wasnt as good as COEX The fish arent as varied and out of 3 beluga fish are dead2 of them are dead and theres only one so it looks so lonely 
10128,5, Its smaller than I thought but sometimes the kids like it 
10129,4, It is well organized so that you can have a good time indoors with your children 
10130,5,My son had a lovely time The exhibits were interesting and varied The facilities were clean and even during covid the rules were followed but you didnt feel it Go during the week for fewer crowds no 
10131,4, Cute and well decorated sorry for the space 
10132,3, It had the most fish species but it didnt feel grand and big The sea lion show was fun 
10133,5, My nephew liked it very much Best for traveling with children 
10134,5, I liked it very much 2 times as if for the first time  
10135,5,Beautiful aquarium
10136,5, Lotte World Aquarium visited every two years I was able to visit at a low price through the card company event We issue a 4hour parking pass so it is not burdensome 
10137,5, I really enjoyed it There are many wonderful animals and I want to go there again 
10138,5, Its shorter than I thought but Im very satisfied if I go together on the way to Lotte Tower 
10139,5, Weekends are better than fish Lots of people but good facilities 
10140,5,Good to see with children
10141,5, Beluga dolphins will be returned to nature soon so hurry up to see them 
10142,4, It is said that the coex fire aquarium is better but the advantage of this place is that there is a lot of content to enjoy besides the fire aquarium and the underground restaurant is of good quality and cheap Our 
10143,2, The Ocean Pavilion is so lame There are not too many fish especially in the large tank 
10144,4,Good place to meet Belluga
10145,5,I dont know how but all the fish love taking pics Beautiful place
10146,4, It was the most recent aquarium so it was nice to see a variety of fish species and the overall cleanliness of the facility It is recommended to purchase tickets online 
10147,4, Its not worth the money there are a lot of babies and its amazing haha 
10148,2,It is good for local aquarium but beluga should be freed  Not a suitable place for such animal
10149,5, Just looking at the beluga is good Parking discount honey 
10150,4, It has a fantastic atmosphere and is a space where people of all ages can enjoy Sadly three or two of the beluga died Its beautiful but its so friendly that its sad at the same time 
10151,5,Great place for kids and families Prefer on an afternoon at a weekday with limited crowd compared to weekend
10152,3, Due to the presence of Arabs and the overall revitalization of tourism every shopping mall must have a variety of halal foods 
10153,4, It will go in Busan we have a better oceanarium and much more 
10154,5,Maybe I was just in a bad mood but the aquarium cheered me up I loved it
10155,5,Nice Big with lots of animals
10156,5, Visited for a discount Its a bit difficult to go at my price but children like it but buying drinks for kids inside is very expensive I recommend buying drinks in advance and putting them in a bag And sooner or 
10157,5,Very fun
10158,3, Recommended for families with children who love aquariums 
10159,5,jwj
10160,3, Compared to other aquariums the overall number of individuals seems to be small It seemed pity that there was only one beluga alone in the large beluga aquarium 
10161,3, A lot of fish are gone compared to before Maybe its because its a night 
10162,5, Aquarium I went to with my 10monthold baby Baby loved it 
10163,5, It was nice to be able to watch beluga with my son who wanted to see it 
10164,4, I think the beluga alone is worth seeing but each one has their own taste so I skip it I am thrilled to be able to communicate with people through eye contact through the glass of the aquarium so much 
10165,4, Lotte World Aquarium Review  Lotte World Aquarium has been with children so far 
10166,5, I got a Tmon discount and went there Im sorry I couldnt see Beluga because of Corona 
10167,5, There are many things to show the child It seems like the route is convenient Parking is a bit disappointing 
10168,5,Awesoooomeee
10169,4, There is a very good marine aquarium in the city center so I had a mysterious experience unlike usual It is a space for healing 
10170,1, I was sad because it was so small The aquarium was small and the big fish looked too difficult I paid the membership fee and refunded it 
10171,5, Visited on holiday with a friend It wasnt as big as I thought because I went to an aquarium overseas but I think Ill like it if I go with the kids  I feel like Ive returned to my childhood after a long time 
10172,4, It is good to change the concept frequently Its a pity that the beluga part is difficult to improve Food and beverage intake zone in the middle is too narrow Many children wouldnt pass it by but its too small 
10173,5, I went with my 10monthold daughters and they really liked it  
10174,4, Do something after paying the full price and use discounts coupons social commerce etc as much as possible 
10175,5,The penguins were cute
10176,4, I was thinking of going but I really enjoyed watching 50 of TDay because it was a weekday so there werent many people and it was good 
10177,5, If you expect sharks you will be very disappointed There is no feeling of being wasted because there is a variety of papers If you have time we recommend Lotte Tower and package products 
10178,5, I had good memories with my motherinlaw  It felt like a dolphin in the deep sea smiling and going 
10179,4, I had a great time with my child However there was a lot of disappointment because there were not many kinds of paper and the tank was not large 
10180,4, Perfect for spending time with your grandchildren There was plenty to see 
10181,4, It was nice to see the fish But its a pity that there are too many people on weekends and holidays 
10182,5, Better than Samsung Still it seems that the children who are imprisoned cannot do anything pitiful 
10183,4, Parking fee is reduced for up to 4 hours Lots of people but lots to see 
10184,1,ANIMAL NEED FREE LIFE  NOT PRISON AQUARIUM  ITS SHAME 
10185,5, Visiting an aquarium is very cool the calmness of the fish is a little bit of the beauty that exists in the immensity of the sea fish of various species and colors I thought it was small but it was very well 
10186,5,Very attractive and awesome place in seoul
10187,5, Its a great place to go with kids in the suburbs of Seoul 
10188,4, Okay the beluga is also amazing but I wish it was a little bit bigger Its not as big as the newer aquarium hehehe 
10189,4, Located in front of Aqua Garden on the B1 of Lotte World Mall Jamsil Impressive clean and wellmaintained interior 
10190,4, There are many things to see but not long considering the parking fee 
10191,4, Its been a while since Ive visited the aquarium Try it out with your family 
10192,5,Beautiful place
10193,5, I go for a walk every time but I am satisfied every time However I wonder if the internal movement is a reasonable one 
10194,4, I only go there with my children Stingrays are impressive 
10195,4, Its fun and enjoyable but it looks like a large aquarium needs more maintenance If you buy a ticket online in advance you can use it at a cheaper price I 
10196,5,We had so much fun
10197,5,Its was fantastic
10198,5,shouth korea and kurdistan
10199,5,Good
10200,4,not bad
10201,4,This amusement park seems to have aged a little or a lot it is felt when you ride one or another attraction for example on a roller coaster the mechanics creaked and our separate trailer jerked sharply when it stopped Or maybe Im so sensitive  but both I and my neighbor had unpleasant sensations In short I did not squeal with delight
10202,5,Seoul Land Luna park is the best theres a lot of rides specially even for kids enjoyed much the Log Ride
10203,5,Cool park
10204,5,Affordable amusement park with lot of rides and fun activities One can spend a whole day here with familyfriends or as couples
10205,5,Its a great place to play with young children  There are many rides and a lot to see
10206,5,Good place for spend free days
10207,5,Had a good time with the kids
10208,5,Fun crowded adult rides take a long time to wait but not for an hour
10209,5,This amusement park is older and dated but it was still fun as there was not really any lines for any of the attractions You will notice that many younger children or families go to this amusement park however it is still good for all ages as there are rides for children and those who are older
10210,4,download Klook and buy entry ticket which is a lot cheaper than buying at the entrance you can do this even if you are already at the entrance and its great to redeem the tickets immediately  We went on Easter Friday but the park was not as full n crowded as Everland so way way more fun in Seoul Land  Very large park with lots of rides and things for the whole family to enjoy its enough for a full day outing many many restaurants inside to choose from for eating
10211,4,This park is in the Seoul Grand Park area not far from the Zoo and has some really cool rides including 3 roller coasters The nice thing about this park is that since most people go to Lotte World and Everland it doesnt get as crowded Theres a good mix of rides with something for everyone
10212,5,The place is suitable for both young children and adult Many attraction can be played by all family members The place is big enough for us to spend full time and play same attraction several times The crowd was less than I expected and we were lucky for that Overall we were happy to get the chance to play all the attractions with beautiful view of autumn scenery along the way to Seoul Land by walk or by sky lift from nearby station
10213,3,Although this is one of the most convenient theme parks to go to in SeoulGyeonggido it lacks a real crowd drawing ride Kinda like Lotte Worlds lesser cousin  A good place to go when you have nothing else to do or are unable to go to Lotte World of Everland
10214,5,the trip is nice to go down of the hill and the view is lovely  you can see the park and lack and trees and mounting
10215,5,This is an outdoor amusement park  Highly recommended for kids and you have many rides that you can enjoy without queuing for long  Many local food stalls within the park and you will not go hungry
10216,4,This is a outdoor theme park consist of different kind of themes for children If you would like to have fun with your children this is one of a good choose for you But it is a bit cold in winter
10217,4,Maybe this theme is old already or maybe I came during winter or maybe combination of both There is really very little people in this theme park There is so little people that I believe because of it many of the rides is closed or seems closed But if you approach the rides some of them is actually open and the staff will return and operate it they seems to be talking to other staff which also their rides have no guest riding it lol  A little anti climax since the mood is so different from lotte world or everland but a very good point here is that you can practically ride everything that is operating even if we came at noon time because there is no queues mostly Only thing to note is many street food stall is closed so you have to eat at their restaurant which is also empty so dont come here on empty stomach  Everything is old and such dont expect pretty stuff but during winter they have ice sledge which in my opinion is the most fun ride and worth coming No waiting time can play as much as you want I will not grade this theme park higher or lower than everland both are as good just different expectations
10218,2,This place is definitely for kids probably younger than 6 or 7 years old Rides are not exciting or thrilling at all Boring
10219,5,The place is so deserted and empty when we went on a weekday Perhaps the rides are more suitable for younger children 512 years old or its not as popular as the other 2 theme parks Or maybe some of the rides are abit run down  There are probably only less than 80 people during our visit and my kids can repeat the same ride 6 times without ridiculous queue Mostly younger kids like 1215 years old and lesser couples They have a huge rollercoaster and drop down just like the popular theme park Price is half compared to Lotte World when you purchase through KLOOK app Super worth it and you need walk 3 mins after exit from train station to take the elephant ride to the theme park Or walk to park in 15 mins  There are restaurants 711 cafes and 1 halal Kebab stall near Tomorrow Land For muslims there is a dedicated musollah near 711 please ask the staff to open the door for you Very clean and spacious with separate rooms however we cant use the tap so its handy to bring a bottle of clean water
10220,4,We has fun with our parents and young children  The sky lift was too short and expensive though but had good experience  Visit in clear day 
10221,5,This place is absolutly amazing i went on both the big rides and walked around looking at all the cool exhibits that they had such as an village styled from the past which served some delicious BBQ chicken kebabs everywhere i went i saw people having fun and children laughing made me feel happy to be able to visit this amusement park
10222,5,I love the kmovie My Sassy Girl so much So I book a discount ticket online to Seoul Land Its really big and beautiful What impressed most is the SkyX Its great damn fun The fee is not included in admission I enjoy the tour so much By the way I book the ticket on Hulutrip it was so fast and easy
10223,5,Multicultural families in Korea can get halfprice yearly passes and foreigners visiting Korea can get great deals on tourist websites Seoul Land is a bit tired and needs a bit of TLC but there is plenty to do and the kids love it My 6 and 7 year old can go on most rides Parking is free during the week and the surrounding mountain views are really pretty For a full day experience combine Seoul Land with the Grand Park zoo We love the rollercoasters flume ride and Larva Twister the most Food and beverages are not too expensive and outside food is allowed in if you prefer to have a picnic There are lots of water fountains too
10224,5,Very nice place My family loves these old theme parks  nostalgic not that crowded not much queue and traditional rides  Have been going to these old parks in Japan and continue to do so in Seoul  Theres a zoo in the same area if time permits too
10225,4,Although the facilities seems to be a lil old  its still great The rollercoasters are not that bad Love the viking  felt more thrilling than the rollercoaster rides actually  The view walking from the subway to Seoul Land is amazing and breathtaking  especially during sunset
10226,5,I have visited Lotte world and Everland every time I visited Korea However this year i choose Seoul Land We spend 4 hours in Seoul Land and my kids really enjoy themselves You can reach there by the subway  Comparing to Lotte World and Everland the entrance fees is a lot more cheaper
10227,3,Because of cold weather and small number of visitor some rides are not operated Parade and events were not lively compare to other season
10228,5,Came here to try the 2 famous rollercoster And all beyond what Im expected It is really nice to spend our hole day in here So many attractions and and much places to take a photo
10229,4,The place was good had a great time but the majority of the park was for children Snacks inside the park were great Would recommended it for a day  of fun
10230,4,Im very happy the ticket price for foreigner is cheap Rides is ok Not much of choices Food selection is normal for a park Ice cream corn dog etc good for a day trip to bring your children during weekend Less foreigners
10231,5,we visited Tokyo Disneyland Seoul Land and Lotte World on the same vacation right two countries and my 6 year old son loved Seoul Land the most by far the rides were great versions of lots of classics for kids at every age his problem with Disney which is better for 10 year olds that are really into those characters the cost wasnt high either for entry or food and lines werent so bad main rides lines could be long at times they even had a kids play area so that we could get out of the rides and lines mode for awhile a playground theme place there was also a daycare indoor version we didnt use it reminded me of the classic parks I visited as a child kind of out of fashion in the US now since everbigger rides and commercial themes have taken over
10232,4,My wife and I went here with her brother and his wife while we were visiting their family in Seoul Compared to most amusement parks in the US it was incredibly clean well maintained and efficiently run We never waited more than a minute or two to board the rides and thoroughly enjoyed the sky tram ride that gives you an aerial view of the park Food was reasonably priced and delicious Make sure to take pictures with the Gangster stockades in the center area; always good for a laugh
10233,4,We went on a Monday morning to avoid the crowd but surprised to find that the amusement park was quite deserted My 2 kids have fun but some of the rides were not opened dont know if its due to the winter season I find that most of the rides are more suitable for children of age 310 years old We missed the snow sledding timing a real pity as it looked fun
10234,3,This park looks older than Lotte World but it has a zoo there and less crowded There are the usual roller coaster rides but some of them might be closed during the low peak season There is a science museum opposite the park which can be an place to go after the park
10235,4,I love the amusement parks hereno extremely long lines or outrageous prices This time we foreigners got half price admission Very well worth the trip and excitement Very family oriented and the food is not bad The trick is picking something you know you like before trying something new
10236,5,I liked the palce very much and I believe from time I visited the place  it was 1999 it became even better Excellent zoo and very nice amusement park makes it ideal for having a great day you can also staying in the Seoul land cottages and plan your enjoyment there for couple of days as the territory is huge one should plan visiting the place not in a hottest day as some areas need long walkings in open areas
10237,4,Its right next to the Seoul grand park subway station The zoo has a sky lift and apart from usual animals  it features a dolphin show There is a colourfulbird section dedicated to parrots A trail runs among the mountains surrounding the zoo
10238,4,We are a military family with a 9yr old and a 3yr old First tip  take the subwayif you dont read anything else in this review remember thistake the subway Its easy inexpensive drops you off right at the Seoul Grand Park entrance and you do not deal with any traffic at all So we took the subway exited the station and walked about 12 mile to the tram station 2700 won later we boarded the tram and the 2nd stop is Seoul Land 1st stop is the zoo The tram ride is one way it will cost you another 2700 won to take it back TIp 2  pay the won and take the tram or 12 your day will be walking to and from the entrance I have no idea why and the website said we would have to pay close to 120000 won but they charged us 45000 and we could ride all of the rides until the park closed The park is dated but for 40 for the entire family how can you beat it There are 3 big roller coasters a bungey jump Free Fall for anyone who has ever been to a 6 flags and a few other rides intense enough to make you want to throw your breakfast up Tip 3  This is very importantIf you littlest one is over 100cm I would seriously pass on this amusement park Our littlest one is 101cm and they measured him off prior to every single ride Thank God he busted 100cm or else it would have been a very long disappointing trip We went expecting Seoul Land not Disney and not Busch Gardens If you go there wanting to have a really cool afternoon with your kids there is more than enough rides for every age group No its not huge No its not Busch Gardens Yes we had a great day with our kids spent about 7 hours at the park with absolutely no lines no hassle and a very friendly staff willing to go out of their way to make it a special day Tip 4  If you are a Westerner you may want to stick to the burger restaurants but there is fried chicken and a Turkish booth selling Kebabs and Gyros With the subway the tickets the tram lunch snacks drinks and even a few toys we paid around 100000 total for our family of 4 no kidding Last and final tip  Go
10239,4,We went to Seoulland on Xmas eve 2012 and we absolutely love there Though we came on a day where there was no Xmas performance there wasnt any queue either We hopped on to many rides countless of times and enjoyed ourselves in the chilling weather There were gift shops and restaurants around This is more of a local amusement park where the locals hung out compared with Lotteworld or Everland We enjoyed snow sledding there as well Not as grand as Everland but the scenery and atmosphere made up for it 
10240,3,definitely dont go here in the winter even going in march is not a smart move i nearly lost my face when going on the rollercoasters not from screaming but rather the ghastly icy wind gushing at my face should seriously rethink going to any amusement attractions during winter
10241,4,I went to see the maple leaves at seoul park together with my kidsmy sister and nephewWowthe leaves all in red colour are so beautifulI really love it very muchWe took cable car with red rooftop up to the middle of the hill and you can see a lot of animals along the cable car goes upHere we change the blue colour rooftop cable car up to the top of the hillHere you can see a lot of maple trees with red leavesThere are few tourist so we can enjoyed the amazing scene without any disturbedWe went to the amusement park called Seoul Land tooKids really love it because they can play many times as they want since there are just few people comes on Monday
10242,3,I went to Seoul Land with my family I think theres the amusement park part and the zoo part We went to the zoo part Actually we were planning to go to the amusement park but we went there by accident Anyways it didnt cost that much There were many animals It wasnt bad I guess we had a good timeBut I think I would go to the amusement park next time if I have a chance
10243,2,we took our 5 nieces and nephews here on Oct 28 and the place was OK I guess As an American that has visited Disney Resort and Six Flags this place is of much lower quality The rides are very dated for an amusement park There is one roller coaster that is Six Flags Quality and the rest of the place seems to be stuck in the 70s For western visitors I would say this would be a giant letdown The food available is OK but unless you have lived in Korea for a biti did for two years and developed a taste for the local food you may have trouble finding anything other than fried chicken My advice for Westerners take the kids to a temple or historic site where they can learn something about another culture If you live in Korea sorry this is what you have to put up with for an amusement park
10244,3,Seoul Land is an old style theme park with somewhat antiquated rides and games Very few activities available but for a day out of school on a field trip it fits the bill Have accompanied my children there on several occasions and have never been impressed Tight parking spaces and no pre determined traffic flow caused unnecessary traffinc jams when it came time to go home Not really recommended
10245,4,Disclaimer I have not been to Everland or Lotte World However as parks go this was a great experience First mind the audience which is for young people or families Second it is inexpensive Third it is an older park Finally the rides are more intense than their equivalent in the USA  We went on a Tuesday when it was cool and school is in There were a number of young kids there on school trips and they were the only crowd to be had It was very sparsely populated The temperatures and short lines were great  We only paid 28000 won for two people all day  all rides though it was shown to be 32000 per person for that ticket That was a super deal and we got it at the counter I dont know why Additionally the park food is very reasonably priced just a smidge above street fair price  The park was built prior to the Olympics in Seoul and most of the rides are meant for younger people; however they are more intense than their equivalent in the states The flying carpet pirate ship frontal spinning ride two roller coasters etc are all worth it If you go on a cool day when most the crowds will be minimal you will have a blast
10246,1,My wife and I visited Seoul Land on Oct 17 2011 Having already been to Lotte World we were expecting something similar but were disappointed The park looks like a 40year old Disney prototype thats been left to the elements for 5 years; there only seemed to be three rides intended for anyone over 67 years old If in the area stick to the zoo or if looking for an amusement park go to Everland or Lotte World
10247,5, There are various play experience halls so you can give your child a good experience I like it even more because there are various facilities in the park 
10248,5, Its always the best Stateoftheart facilities if not more than that Its a great place to have fun with kids for free or cheap 
10249,4, After the rain I went with my grandchild the weather is so hot I was bathed in sweat There is no entrance fee 
10250,5, Its good because its run by the country so you can enjoy various things for free Zoo botanical garden playground equipment playing in the water 
10251,5,Great spot for kids My 3 loved it Free to get in and you only got to pay for rides
10252,5, I went without expectations and it was so good The fountain water playground is open until August 15th I went in the morning and it was not hot and the water was clean 
10253,5,Great place for children and families
10254,4, When I went in the morning the line was short and I was able to ride a lot  
10255,5,It is a good place to bring you children Lots of areas to explore
10256,5, Its perfect if you stop by the Childrens Grand Park and amusement parks at the Universal Art Center and play 
10257,5,If you looking for an amusement park maybe it is not a best choice But they have a great park including a zoo and a botanical gardenwhich are free
10258,5, Its a very old place Its a good place to look around and relax 
10259,5,As the name says truly a grand park for children It has got water fountains amusement park zoo museum futsal and many more things for children It has got wonderful passage with beutiful Cherry blossom on sideways 
10260,4, There arent many rides but its good to go out with children on a nice day I was worried because I had to walk a lot but when I was 5 or 6 years old I 
10261,5, Its great for an outing A large park in the city center where you can see so many different trees grasses and even animals 
10262,5, A wonderful park and zoo there is nothing to compare with yet Were here for the second time and a lot of impressions not only for children 
10263,5,good
10264,5,Entrance is free This is a large park with many things to do children It has a small but very fun one nice fast roller coaster and several bumper cars and a bunch of other smaller rides for children amusement park closes at 6 pm a 
10265,5, Hot but nice place for a walk Group aerobics around 1800 Exercise Its amazing what youre doing and its cute 
10266,5, It is good to go with young children In summer there is a fountain show You can rent a stroller 
10267,5, There are various animals and it is good to go on a weekday outing 
10268,5, I think Ive been there before the 1988 Olympics but this time around its really nice for a family outing Its good for a leisurely walk and the zoo is free but the animals are diverse and the facilities are 
10269,4, Although the weather was hot we had so much fun at the zoo and amusement park There was a fountain and plenty of places to sit and eat 
10270,1,Too old roller coaster
10271,5, The ride at the amusement park isnt long and its boring 
10272,5, Animals are also gathered in one place so its nice to be able to see lions tigers elephants etc without walking much 
10273,4,It was an unplanned trip but its been a place worth going there are lot of animal Botanical garden water animals and so many others There is a guid who can tell you if you hire one Theres no littering around clean and neat
10274,5, Ive been there before and its so good The zoo was free and well maintained Everyone was fine except for the elephants The elephants were free and looked old so they looked a little sad 
10275,4, Admission is free but it was nice to see various animals  
10276,4, 20220605  I went there with my boyfriend after a really long time 
10277,5, Its good to see animals for free The aquarium is also better than expected 
10278,5, It is a place that gives the value of living in Seoul Good access to public transportation spacious and sufficient natural space and even the zoo Since its free it doesnt get any better than this Its perfect 
10279,4, Its nice that its not as complicated as other large parks And the amusement park is for middle and elementary school students The cost performance is good for children to play but there is a waiting time 
10280,5, I waited a long time but it was so much fun There is also a zoo 
10281,5, Its free You can see many animals Parking is a bit expensive but the parking lot is spacious 
10282,5, delicious food fun rides botanical garden zoo very good for children to play 
10283,5, It is spacious and comfortable Beasts Our animals are sleeping whenever we go Zebras seem lonely too Seals swim vigorously 
10284,3, It is very complicated because there are two adults per child and I had to wait at least an hour and a half because the rides were crowded 
10285,5, Its a great way to spend time with your kids There is no entrance fee so you can visit the zoo and botanical gardens Its perfect when you dont have a place to go because you only pay for parking and its large 
10286,5, Its free and a great place for a family outing Animal watching ride on rides Indoor garden animal show playground fountain show 
10287,5,Good
10288,5, A wonderful inexpensive Luna Park a free zoo and a lot of all kinds of entertainment for children  you will find all this in the vast and beautiful Great Childrens Park 
10289,3, Very classic park for Korea a zoo is however notable but the size of the cages reminds me of the one there was at the time when we did not care about the welfare of animals 
10290,5, I like to play with children Admission is free Lots of play areas such as zoos rides and dirt playgrounds 
10291,4, Everything is good except parking The zoo is free and seems more reasonable than other rides 
10292,4,Went on spring season Weather was still chill but still lot of people will be walking eating or having a picnic in the grass of the park If you walk enough you may find a Zoo free entry which I didnt like much cuz I can see the trauma that the animals have by being in a small place The park good the zoo not so much
10293,5, It used to be a space for children but now it has been transformed into a space that can be used by people of all ages It still welcomes us as it was in the past and is full of memories when we were young and sat on 
10294,4, It is good to use the zoo and amusement facilities in Seoul together 
10295,3, Its been a long time since Ive been here but the weather was nice and it was so good 
10296,5,And for free too Super fun for the kids
10297,5, Great place to work out and play There is also a full parking lot a place where you can use a replacement chair 
10298,5, I went there with my children on Sunday May 23rd The amusement park isnt very big so I let my 1st middle school daughter and 5th grader son play as they like and the adults rested in the shade The zoo is 
10299,5, Childrens Grand Park which I have been with my family for a long time has been in operation for a long time but the managers work hard to keep it in the best condition 
10300,5, It is the back gate but it is about 1km to the main gate 
10301,4, Everything is good Drinks and food prices are too flamboyant Guess Ill have to buy it anyway 
10302,5, It is located close to both Childrens Grand Park Station and Achasan Station As a representative park in Gwangjingu there are small amusement rides and a small zoo There are playgrounds for children all over the 
10303,5, I had a great time outdoors with my family after a long time 
10304,5, It was before Childrens Day so I was a little worried but it was good because there werent many people than I thought The wind is soft The kids have been running around and having fun after a 
10305,5, It was so much fun and it was so cool to see the fountain  
10306,4, Imagination country is so good Even ten times is not worth the money It is good to have a picnic with a mat and there is no entrance fee 
10307,4, I went to Childrens Grand Park to see rides and take a walk looking at animals 
10308,4,This is a nice place to go with kids There is a lot of space to move around in part is park with lots of outdoor playing facilities and the other part is a zoo with all kinds of animals The space the animals have to move around in is 
10309,4, Although it is old it is a place where you can experience greenery and amusement parks in the city center 
10310,5, The animals were also so cute and spacious so it was nice to walk around The botanical garden was cool too Even on the weekend there werent that many people so it was better If youre hesitant to visit come 
10311,5, It was good because it was free admission and the simple rides were fun 
10312,5, Its really good  Its green and its full of old beautiful trees I like the cafe too 
10313,5, Nice to visit again after Corona is relieved Opening an amusement park It was good because there were a lot of rides for children and the animals in the zoo were standing instead of lying down so I came to see 
10314,5,A very big and nice place for the whole family Not many people speak English there but most of the signs and posters have an English translation with it
10315,4, Good for kids outing without spending money The rides have the basics of the Viking train Better than the quality of the arboretum zoo etc 
10316,4,Nice park
10317,5, The playground is well equipped and the water is easy to find and there are many trash cans 
10318,5, Zoo is good Free admission Outdoor childrens playgrounds and indoor exhibition halls were closed to prevent the spread of Corona but as of May 22 many have been opened Especially in amusement parks compared to 
10319,5, Childrens Day the most crowded day Amusement park tickets can be purchased in advance on Naver There are unmanned kiosks in several places Its not all counting at the 
10320,5, It is spacious for babies to play and there are many animals Children love the musical fountain There are many benches where you can rest and clean It is very good 
10321,5, It is very good for light picnic with children and animal watching 
10322,5, A park where you can go casually with children The zoo botanical garden and playground can be used without excessive use and it is even better because they can be used for free Amusement parks are also 
10323,5, very good Parking is a bit expensive but I think it would be better if you use the subway It is perfect for children in the lower grades of elementary school and younger to run around 
10324,5, The rides were really fun The spinning swing was fun 
10325,5,Love the flowers
10326,5, The children who were excited to see animals rather than animals were cute 
10327,5,Good book good zoo
10328,5, As the child is a little older there are many rides that can be used Its close to my house so I go there every now and then 
10329,5, The air is fresh there are childrens rides and its a great place for a family outing with a packed lunch 
10330,5, A place of memories A smiling family photo from childhood for letting me be in it 
10331,1, The amusement park closes at 630 so it is not marked on the unmanned ticket machine 
10332,5,The best public park in Seoul
10333,4, I stopped here for a while with my son his sons friends family and my son who came here after a few years I came here with my son friend and family in the morning in Seoul Forest to 
10334,4, I go every Childrens Day and there are a lot of people but its a good place to go You can also have a picnic on the grass 
10335,5, Playground Lack of facilities Not enough places to eat Not enough places to eat 
10336,5, May 5th Childrens Day A rainbow appeared in the fountain on a sunny day Its a nice day Childrens Grand Park is also loved by children 
10337,5, I have lived nearby since kindergarten and went there often A park that has become more affectionate and better after having children and 
10338,4, It is the only place in downtown Seoul that has a zoo botanical garden amusement park and large open space Its not very big but its a nice place where you can enjoy everything in a cute way Music fountain is 
10339,5, All you have to do is spread out a mat or tent and rest The surrounding landscaping is good and the rides are available at a reasonable price Its nice to rest under the shade of a tree on a day like today 
10340,5, Its the best its spacious and nice a place that anyone would have been to when they were young 
10341,5, Admission Free Is this a true story Its a really nice place to go out but dont bring your car on the weekend Parking is great 
10342,3, Animals are filthy Everyone is sleeping 
10343,3, About 10 rides The line is long so if you dont go early in the morning you can cut it off with 35 tickets Even if the queue is long it is much shorter than Everland or 
10344,5, The park is very big and there is also a zoo and botanical garden but the zoo and the botanical garden are closed earlier about 5 pm In the zoo you can see elephants lions tigers monkeys various birds 
10345,5, Now take some entrance fees Thousands of dollars per person That way you will have some money to pay for and manage At least its used to make the animals and staff happier 
10346,4, A place where you can easily heal in Seoul A place where you can enjoy amusement rides a zoo and greenery Now is a good time to visit 
10347,4, Its great for kids parking is very difficult 
10348,5, I really like itit seems like a blessing to live near a place like this in Seoul 
10349,5, It was a Saturday so there were a lot of people I enjoyed visiting the zoo 
10350,5, There are many lawns and fields so there are lots of places to sit and spread out the mats the music fountain was good and the children were so happy even to the zoo and amusement park 
10351,5, When I go on a weekday its quiet and there are a lot of cuties out on a picnic The size of the zoo is just about the level of kindergarten or elementary school students 
10352,5, Its cool in spring Great park is awesome 
10353,5,The most beautiful park in Seoul specially in spring and fall
10354,5, The free pass 24000 won feels expensive but I really enjoyed it at the amusement park I like to run around on the lawn and watch the fountain 
10355,4, I have to go with people on Sundays Ive been to for the first time in a while so its crazy 
10356,5, This is the first time Ive been to Seoul in 16 years You can enter the zoo for free and the amusement park has various things that are not scary If I had been closer I would have come often 
10357,5, Good transportation and convenient Free admission A variety of amusements and zoos 
10358,5, I went to Childrens Grand Park to see flowers but I only came here after peoplewatching The rides are so much fun 
10359,4, The flowers are pretty and the facilities and animals seem to be well taken care of However it is a bit congested in the Corona situation with people gathering all 
10360,4, I have not changed 10 years ago after remodeling I have not changed anything until now Is it good or bad I would like the elderly people in the neighborhood  Since the childrens park is the senior park it is 
10361,5, The cherry blossoms are so pretty when the rain is falling There were so many people but I felt frustrated 
10362,5, The fact that such a park exists in the middle of Seoul means that Korea is a rich country where people live very well 
10363,5, The best place to enjoy the blooming cherry blossoms on a spring day 
10364,5, Cherry blossoms are in full bloom It was a weekend so there were so many people that the food stalls run out at 130 in the afternoon but it is spacious and beautiful enough to spread out a mat and relax 
10365,4, Its a place Ive been to since I was a kid There are many things to see and admission is free so it is good to go lightly 
10366,5, Childrens Grand Park Neungdong Gwangjingu Seoul With a total area of 218000 pyeong it is the largest natural park for children in Asia It was established on May 5 1973 when President Park Chunghee was 
10367,5, There are many flowers and trees so its good to take a walk and its really nice to have a zoo 
10368,5,This is so amazing park There are many animals and attraction that you enjoy
10369,5, It is one of the best cherry blossom spots in Seoul Parking is paid and admission is free 
10370,5, The scenery is so beautiful if you go when the cherry blossoms are in bloom You can also use the zoo for free so its hard to describe in words how 
10371,5, The cherry blossoms are in full bloom and it is beautiful There were so many cars so parking was difficult Guuimun parking lot was barely parked because there were people who came out before 12 noon I bought the 
10372,5, This is the place to go with your family full of sights 
10373,5, A place with memories from my childhood to my childs childhood 
10374,5, I visited for the first time to celebrate the cherry blossom season The parking lot seems a bit narrow 
10375,4, On weekends from April to October there are many people and it is crowded and you have to wait a long time to get on the rides The parttimer at the snack corner has slow hands so ordering is slow 
10376,5, Come here to see cherry blossoms on April 8 2019 before the corona virus April 9 2022 after three years and one day 
10377,4, The park is nice but the people who use it are messy especially the toilet 
10378,4, Even now in middle age it is a fun place for children Parking is a chronic problem 
10379,5, Its nice to be able to watch the cherry blossoms alone what Why are tears 
10380,5, Nice park for a walk or picnic It is very peaceful to see children and their parents enjoying the sun in peace 
10381,3, A place where you can go for a walk without an entrance fee 
10382,5, A walk with colleagues Admission is free trees are thick and parking is cheap 
10383,1, Except that it was good because of the animals it was like dog garbage because it was Gwangjingu Inseonggae fucking dong 
10384,3,Nice park to stroll and enjoy with the whole family  Gave it 3 stars  because the zoo is not a great space for the animals they look emmanciated and letargic Otherwise is a great place for the families to visit
10385,5, The flowers havent bloomed yet but its nice to take a walk when its a good day 
10386,3, About 30 of the animals were blocked from seeing take it into consideration 
10387,4, It was still winter due to Corona so there was an empty and lonely atmosphere The atmosphere is more like a strolling place for the elderly rather than the lively feeling of children 
10388,5, The zoo is now open again Admission is also free so its good to go and play at least once 
10389,5, It is spacious there are many things to see the price is cheap the convenience facilities are good and you can spread the mat Good value for money 
10390,5, It reminds me of my childhood memories of going to Guui Elementary School Thank you for the good time 
10391,5, I went to the Childrens Grand Park Botanical Garden and Zoo Its great for taking a walk or just to see the animals However if you do not 
10392,5, Animals are sleeping for free admission but it was nice to be able to see them Its neat and good for a walk or a short picnic 
10393,5, I made a reservation for Sangsangland with my children to the zoo Perfect course 
10394,5, There are a lot of trees so its nice for a walk Bicycles and kickboards are not allowed and dogs are not allowed for walks so I think it is good for the safety of infants 
10395,3, Nowits not the same as beforeFirst visit in 1985 It is good that the zoo is open as before Corona Parking fee is slowly 
10396,5,fantastic
10397,5, Childrens playground opened A good place for a spring outing 
10398,5, It was a long woman haha Listen to Seoul lets develop the Grand Park What is it its the same no matter how many years pass 
10399,4, There is a free zoo botanical garden playground etc and the facilities are clean so it is a good place to take children up to the age of 7 years old I like to go out when the weather is nice 
10400,4, Parking is difficult due to crowds best value for money 
10401,5, It is a healing space with a walk a zoo and an amusement park However when there are a lot of people parking is a little difficult Tip If you want to tip the road you can park on Sejong University 
10402,5, There arent many people these days so it was nice to have a short queue time Parking is also convenient However there are times when the weather is nice and time is wasted on the way 
10403,5, Good for a walk elephant and tiger can take a look In spring cherry blossoms are in full bloom and are beautiful 
10404,5,This is one of the best parks for children in the Seoul Admission is free here This place has very good accessibility The main gate is near childrens park 
10405,4, Good for a walk There is no entrance fee there are parks and safaris smaller rides hills and tree lawns 
10406,5, Admission is free and you can see animals and plants It is also close to the subway station so transportation is convenient A lot of families come here to play and even if I have children I think I will 
10407,5, tree bird animal 
10408,5, Babies love to see free elephants The parking fee is 1800 won per hour So cheap and time consuming 
10409,4, Today is a public holiday so there are a lot of people I always have fun with my kids Its nice to have an amusement park and also see animals Its a pity that I havent seen a lot these days because of Corona 
10410,5,Nice play to take kids too
10411,5, There are many things to see such as fountains botanical gardens large animals and amusement rides and above all it is free to visit and it is close to the station so it is very good to go with children 
10412,4, It was good that the children used it without waiting time 
10413,4, After dinner it is good to take a leisurely walk Across the street from the back gate is the famous Sintobulgi Tteokbokki 
10414,5, It is a very suitable place for walking and sports and the environment is clean and well maintained There are so many amusement facilities suitable for children and the children love it 
10415,4, It is a childrens grand park but there are no children only the elderly Because it was winter most of the animals werent there and there were only two 
10416,4, Corona prevention bird flu subzero weather Is it a childrens grand park with three beats Its like a senior park without children or animals but it was nice to see the botanical garden 
10417,1, Do they only like animals Ive seen smiley cats in small cages marmots roaming around in their feces elephants in an enclosure thats too small and a wallibi in an area thats too 
10418,5, Son 4 years old embarrass his father because he kept saying he tried hippos after going to the zoo Note no hippopotamus 
10419,4,It was much better than I thought cuz it was free
10420,4, Excellent value for money but it is very crowded on weekends so parking is difficult Recommend to visit on weekdays 
10421,5, It was nice to go sledding see animals and go to the botanical garden 
10422,5, There are animal viewing and Gatbi rides so its fun to take a walk with children 
10423,5, I run every night for exercise I hope other residents dont get scared or report it I just turn on music and walk along the road I dont walk in step with anyone 
10424,3, I went to do chores nearby and I had free time so I went for a walkI visited Childrens Grand Park Zoo It was free admission so there were a lot of local seniors taking a walk Due 
10425,4, I went in the second week of January Its a cold day so I didnt see monkeys or desert animals at the zoo and there were all animals in the wild beasts I came here to heal in the city center 
10426,5, My son loves it and best of all its free Best to avoid crowded times 
10427,3, After 30 years with my family I went for a walk from home for exercise As soon as I entered the entrance an elephant was eating the dry hay that was fed The elephants body was in a mess You look old The whole 
10428,5, The animals are well taken care of and there are so many things to see 
10429,5, like The botanical garden is warm and nice 
10430,4, Maybe its because its winter so its less wellmaintained than Gwacheon Seoul Grand Park but the children liked it a lot because it was possible to see the animals up close  
10431,2, I feel sorry for the monkey tiger and elephant trapped in the zoo 
10432,2, Just a deserted playground The only animals are meerkat wallaroos and they are all old people walking 
10433,5, Beautiful place to walk Free admission zoo and herbarium 
10434,5, It was a nice day so I took a walk but it was quiet It was nice to see the zoo for free and to sit on a bench and relax 
10435,4, A place with fresh air and things to see and do in the city center 
10436,5, Even in winter there are many animals in the zoo When I visited there were all but hyenas in the wild beast corner There are other botanical gardens as well as sightseeing and walking so its surprising that all 
10437,1, I am very afraid of rides It looks like its going to fall apart The zoo is okay too 
10438,5, The botanical garden was more fun than I thought Its a cold day so I can only see the botanical garden 
10439,5, There are entertainment facilities and a zoo The place is very big and it is worth a visit 
10440,4, The free zoo is good and the playground facilities are good 
10441,5,nice place for spending time with family
10442,5, I only went to the zoo Due to Corona the indoor exhibition is closed Most of the animals are nocturnal so if you go early during the day most of them sleep When I went back around 2pm everyone was awake I 
10443,4, The zoo was good because admission was free and children cant get out of it when they go to Sangsang Land I think the imagination will be more fun if children can understand the text You must be at least 6 years 
10444,5, Its good because you dont have to wait long in line and its pretty fun 
10445,5,Five Stars for making me young again A childrens amusement park close to Achansan station Adult tickets available for anyone who wants to take 13 rides only Took the roller coaster bumper car and Vikings ship Happiest adult in the park 
10446,4, Its size is not comparable to Seoul Grand Park but it was nice to see animals such as kokiri tigers and lions much closer 
10447,5, Even though it is Kosiguk there are animals in the zoo The playground is also open 
10448,5, The roller coaster is fun I feel like Im back in my childhood  
10449,5, Its a nice place for a walk There were only a few animals in the zoo and it was sad that most of them were old animals with no energy There are many more animals such as 1 lion 1 horai 1 leopard 2 elephants 2 
10450,5, Childrens Grand Park which Ive been to since I was a kid I still love it and I like it  
10451,5, Childrens Grand Park a great place to go with family children and lovers 
10452,5, Its small but there are rides and a zoo so its good to take children Its also good for a walk 
10453,4, Sangsang Land has improved a lot after the remodeling The 2nd floor has changed a lot Its a pity that the 3rd floor water play is only open on weekdays We also visited the zoo and had a great time 
10454,3, Its been a while since Ive been here so its nice and comfortable but the zoo seems to need repairs overallit feels too old Or I wish there were a little more variety of things to enjoy such as an 
10455,5, There is no entrance fee but the walk is good and the zoo is good 
10456,5, Admission is free I also like the zoo and botanical gardens Grand Park Station is the main gate Achasan Station is the back gate 
10457,5, I went with my grandson for the first time but the scenery of the trees in the park is luxurious When my children were young I went with my grandfather and grandmother but now I am going I have a disability so 
10458,5, The childrens park is a very memorable place Hehe I came with my 2nd grade daughter and there are many other parks that are not for children but there are many places that are a bit embarrassing but there is no 
10459,4, Its a nearby park so its recommended as a walking trail these days  
10460,5, There is also a zoo and its a childrens grand park so I looked around a bit but you shouldnt do that lol 
10461,5, You can fully enjoy the scent of autumn and the beautiful watercolor paintings of deciduous trees Please visit us before winter comes 
10462,5, A lunglike place in the city where the seasons are always abundant 
10463,5, Parking is expensive but its quiet so its good to take a walk 
10464,5, I couldnt visit because of Kosiguk but Im so glad that the restrictions are lifted I was full after eating lunch so I went to see hyenas 
10465,5, Its open for free so its great to take a walk and see animals 
10466,4,Nice place for kids can be a good place for half day outing
10467,4, It is also a good course to take a walk when you are bored 
10468,5, I mean the truth Long live President Park made for children 
10469,5, Achasan Exit 4 Its always good to go Zoos and amusement parks are all worth visiting The autumn scenery is especially beautiful 
10470,5, There are also various rides perfect arcade and even a haunted house 
10471,5, There is a park and a zoo and it is very nice Parking fee is also cheap But its a parking war Wait 1 hour 
10472,5,Big park where you can have a picnic with your family
10473,5,A really beautiful place to visit and to take a long walk enjoying nature and landscape
10474,5, Memories for adults Best value for money amusement park for children 
10475,5, I recommend that you park your car at Sejong University for a fee and enter early to have fun 
10476,4, It was good that park admission was free but the amusement park and facilities were outdated Still I enjoyed the last autumn leaves very well 
10477,3, Childrens Grand Park I visited in a long time The autumn leaves were pretty and I had a good time watching the animals 
10478,5,First time visiting love the open space and landscape Small zoo for everyone to visit and playground for young one Today was specially nice due to the perfect autumn weather 
10479,5,A suitable place for the weekend
10480,5, Taking the children for a walk and watching the animals A large space and a lawn where you can spread out a mat eat snacks and run in the shade of a tree are perfect 
10481,4, The autumn leaves are beautiful admission is free and parking is good as long as you enter the area well 
10482,5, Its good that its open for free It is also nice to walk in the autumn colors If you have small children you can also see the animals and go for a walk 
10483,5, Its great to have such a complex amusement park in downtown Seoul We also do animal watching and Cheongsolmo comes to visit us when we take a break It is a park that I want to visit again and again even if I go 
10484,5, I love that I can see animals up close with my 8yearold child a place I often visit every year 
10485,5,Suited place to feel the change of seasons
10486,5, When I was young I remember riding the Blue Dragon train with my father 30 years ago now with my sonThe rides are up to date 
10487,5, I go there often with my children There are many amenities and the bathroom is clean and nice Weekdays are better than weekends 
10488,5, I like to go for a walk on the weekend The foliage is nice 
10489,4,A recreational place for kids to enjoy along with some rides but a little expensive to buy a ticket for all rides 
10490,5,One of my favorite parks here
10491,5, Zoo  Amusement Park  Central Seoul Its a place that cant be bad 
10492,5, It is surprising and grateful that there is a space like this in the city center Thanks to you I have been enjoying the deepening autumn season 
10493,4, If possible go before 5 pm Animal viewing hours are until 5 pm And there are many places that cannot be entered due to Corona 
10494,5, Free admission lots of animals and a large and clean park to take a walk 
10495,5, I like to go with my kids Parking is a bit difficult but the subway connection is good There are suitable rides and it is good to see animals up close 
10496,5, It is best for children to see various animals and ride fun rides on a large lawn and sandy playground for children 
10497,5, Its free but you can see a lot of animals and a lot of blue backgrounds 
10498,4, Its all good but the animals have stereotyped behavior so its a pity 
10499,3, There were too many people and the ride time seemed short 
10500,4, When I arrived at 1050 on a Saturday there was a seat in the back door parking lot so I parked right away I went to ride a ride but I waited an hour for the Flume Ride and waited 2030 minutes for the rest In 
10501,5, Its called Childrens Grand Park but its good for adults too If you go on weekdays or in the morning it is quiet and if you walk in the forest you can smell the phytoncide scent that is not easily felt in the 
10502,1, Uphill There is a lot of downhill so go for a walk or exercise Stroller required Because its free theres not enough things to see eat and play Not enough 
10503,5, Childrens satisfaction with the free pass Hot dogs are the taste of life 
10504,5, Spacious in Seoul with free admission and the animals are the best 
10505,4, No entrance fee  I like to take a walk 
10506,5, There are a lot of people on the weekend so its good to be outdoors 
10507,5, Children under the age of 7 I ran around all day with a free pass I lost weight after chasing my son A place that satisfies the satisfaction of young children and at the same time 
10508,4, Its conveniently located in downtown Seoul so its good for family outings as there are zoos and parks even if its not an amusement park Amusement parks are mainly for children so there are no thrilling 
10509,4,This park great to children and young student The big foundation is very cool
10510,4, Parking is good because its free of error Full of people 
10511,3, I like it because its free Its difficult to get into the parking lot 
10512,5, It was perfect for taking preschoolers for free I think Ill go there often until I grow up 
10513,3, Right in front of the subway in Seoul the only place where you can enjoy a zoo amusement rides and a large park together 
10514,4, Weekend parking is a real mess Please be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes for parking 
10515,4, It is good for a walk with children and free admission to many places such as zoos and botanical gardens Convenient to carry with a stroller 
10516,4, Infants children and adults It is a place where you can watch animals for free and relax I recommend it 
10517,2, No animals no sights just a park feel 
10518,5, A great place to make great memories for your kids for free 
10519,5, Its a great place for a walk and for kids I like the forest 
10520,3, There were a lot of people so I didnt ride much The quarantine rules are not in place but the safety guarantee was good 
10521,4, Anyone can enter for free There is a fee to use the rides The food sold at the street vendors outside the park is not fresh and I would not recommend it 
10522,5, Its already the 10th There are play facilities and there are animals so I go a lot But because I went on the weekend the parking lot was full The parking fee is 1300 won and the 
10523,5, I went in 1979 I went in 1998 and it seems like its been 24 years since I went 
10524,4, Childrens Grand Park in a wide space Trees flowers many and many animals many people This is the area of traces of suffering today 
10525,4, The reason I deducted one star is that the facilities are all good When you guide me for parking in the East Gate parking lot do you make the full sign visible when waiting It was unpleasant so I deducted one 
10526,5,Nice place
10527,5,Very nice and huge park where you can always go for a walk or picnic Its a rare place to enjoy real nature in Seoul too Anyone would agree as its always quite crowded all the time
10528,5,Perfect place to go with kids many rides and lots of space for play but you should go in the morning It looks creepy and looks like an abandoned town at night
10529,3,Great place to let children run and play Zoo is very depressing and deteriorating I wouldnt take kids to see the zoo I saw many parents throwing stuff at the animals and by all means dont let your children be unattended here I was holding my baby and two adults rushed to get a picture of a monkey pushing me aside and standing in front of my child Ill never forget it The chimp was amazing the adults were animalsThe place is safe but so crowded and old men and women will shove children  The land is great a piece of nature set in the city Beautiful nature and weekdays are less crowded Weekends from spring to fall are rough; religious groups and summer camps occupy most of the land but there are quiet places if you search  Ive seen elderly men and women knocking squirrel nests out of trees to forage for acorns Now there are signs informing people not to steal acorns Theres annoying music playing all over the park so you cant escape Kpop even in nature  The best thing about this place is the amphitheater Great live performances I highly recommend But sometimes there are very young girls age 815 dressed like prostitutes twerking to Kpop on stage and it was SO awkward  especially as tons of old guys filmed it yeah maybe grandparents but I saw a lot of guys wandering by to film Was so weird  Convenience stores are here so youll have places to buy water or snacks  Theres an ancient amusement park with rides that look like theyre from 1962 so ride at your own risk I like the amusement park but again stay close to your kids and as always prepare to be racially mocked disrespected or abused  Enjoy this beautiful park Avoid the morbid zoo
10530,5,The park is attractive to both adults and children in autumn late Oct early Nov The autumn colours are fascinating but they vary from year to year depending on weather etc This year the summer is long and dry but the ginkgo and maple trees still show off their beautiful autumn colours although not as good as those of last year The park has a good zoo apart from an amusement park etc I like to go there and to the Seoul Grand Park when I visit Seoul as both are great places for photography and leisure
10531,4,My 17 month old daughter was so extremely excited to see all the animals and did not want to leave Korea has so many familyfriendly places and this is definitely one of them I think I may have seen some strollers to rent on our way in not entirely sure Overall this was a lovely experience for both of us and we look forward to going back with my husband
10532,4,We went with our 20month old toddler and really enjoyed the whole day there Its a huge park with outdoor and indoor playground Probably because we went on a weekday the whole park was very quiet Entrance to the main park is free but certain attractions charge a fee Key highlights 1 best thing about this place is the Seoul Childrens Museum Theres an entrance fee but its not expensive They also allow u to exit and reenter on the same day There are 4 storeys catering to different children age groups and the set up on each floor is very impressive especially the water play on level 3 I think its fun for all kids from toddlers to teens 2 catch the animal show called Anistory featuring many types of animals including seals birds cats monkey etc Need to pay for entry though Its quite entertaining Even though we didnt understand the language we still enjoyed it very much 3 the park is massive great if u like outdoor walks Theres a huge water fountain show near the Seoul Childrens Museum thats quite impressive too  Overall a nice destination that offers both indoor and outdoor experiences I didnt like the mini zoo though Each enclosure was very small and the animals looked a bit depressed I wouldnt recommend if your only objective is to visit the zoo
10533,3,This place is a hidden gem and not many tourists visit this park Very nice clean and spacious park with lots to see like gardens playground  minizoo Kids would definitely love this place The minizoo is a little sad as its undermaintained and some animals look sad in their enclosures  Plus point Nice clean and spacious park Free entry except for the amusement park section Not crowded  Negative Somewhat undermaintained Has the potential to be much better
10534,5,We had a great time though it was so hot You need to bring or buy lots of water There are lots of places where you can find foodsnackice water or other beverages The kids loved the musical fountain the water playground the animals the Anishow We spent around 4 hours looking around and playing
10535,3,The park is quite far from where we stay at myeongdong and we paid 13000KRW for the cab ride The park is free and contains a zoo where the animals look quite sad and there is a little amusement park when you can pay for the rides The main highlight for us is the Seoul Childrens Museum located near the main entrance
10536,5,Only covered a small part of it as we were mostly busy with the museum but what we saw was fun A great big playground with no shade though big music fountain a junkmade sculpture walk a beautifully designed orangery Lots to see
10537,5,The park was pretty good but even better was the FREE Zoo  Lots of animals to see had some gardens to visit and has a large childrens museum to visit  There are also some walkways over ponds and sculptures to see as you walk around  There was also food stops encase you needed something in a rush but I saw many people bringing in lunches
10538,5,Excellent place to bring your kids with the free zoo and exhibits Do spare time for the childrens museum as well plenty of the little ones to explore inside
10539,4,Visited with my 14 month old while on holiday in Seoul The Childrens Museum is fantastic and has a really nice toddler play area the park is lovely and we had a pic nice in the grass and enjoyed the botanical garden and walking around However it was really sad to see animals like a lion elephant leopard and tiger looking sad in small enclosures Young children are equally happy seeing farm animals so I would have been perfectly happy just with the goats and ponys
10540,5,Nice childrens park mainly consisted of a zoo and an amusement park We were surprised to see the admission is free Also wonderful place to enjoy flower blooming and fall foliage  How to reach Its accessible via both of Metro Line 7 Childrens Grand Park and Line 5 Achasan  Also good place for other ages as well as children There are nice botanical garden ponds outdoor sports complex too  The zoo has many kinds of animals Considering the admission is free its really satisfying Feeding time will be fun even though we missed it  Theres a multistoried pavilion Unfortunately it seemed unable to go up  Attractions at the amusement park arent free The scale isnt that big
10541,4,Visited when I did a trip around Seoul there is many things to see in Seoul but I wanted to take our 7 year old grandson here
10542,5,This is great piblic park for family there are a lot of interesting spot like children museum 1200 won free kids zoo music fountain amusement park You can take subway to childrens grand park line 2line 7 exit 4 or you yan take local bus No 721 from city hall st
10543,4,This park is huge and so beautiful during Autumn We took lots of pic and enjoy ourself almost one whole day here We went during Sunday and not crowded at all Maybe during Nov most tree leaves already fall But we still manage to snap photos with leaves on some trees   There is a convenient store near to the play ground where you can get some microwave warm food  Zoo is free and interesting my kids love it But definitely not for animal lover All animal in zoo I felt is sad and lifeless The elephant seem like had a depression sad  Playground is big and fun  We did not visit the children museum
10544,5,fun entertainment loads of activities for young ones please visit once to have a wonderful experience
10545,4,Last March I went there on a rainy day but the place was still beautiful with cherry blossoms and tulips Went there this time in early Nov and the place was lit with autumn colors maples and ginkgos It was a sunny day There were many children mainly young students on school tours Seoul children are so lucky to have a lovely and huge playground with a zoo For adults it is also great to spend some hours walking in the beautiful and tranquil park The internal amusement park is located at a far corner hence it does not disturb those who love quietude If you like children this is a place to see them bursting out with joy and laughter
10546,5,The park is huge There are childrens museum amusement park and also zoo It was so nice walking with the kids and the roads are big to push the strollers Alot of things to explore and the kids definitely enjoyed it
10547,4,Its a huge park with probably everything in it  a park a zoo a playground an amusement park etc You can easily spend half a day there on a day with nice weather There are also strollers for rent with very reasonable price so theres no need to carry your own stroller in the subway all the way there The zoo and amusement park may be small but perfect for our fiveyearold The foodcourt is not so bad But it would also be nice to bring lunch and have a picnic in the park
10548,5,We went to the Seoul Childrens Museum before heading down towards the park Its pretty well spaced out with a timed water fountain which leads to an open playground for kids and towards a smallish zoo Great outdoor fun for the kids for free
10549,4,Visited Seoul Childrens Grand Park during Summer and it was a great trip Went there at about 4pm and there was the music fountain show Walked around the area a bit before heading towards the zoo and it was already closed Be sure to reach earlier if you intend to visit the zoo and the various museums there since they close pretty early
10550,5,We brought the kids to Seoul Childrens Museum and went around the Seoul Childrens Grand Park The place was huge and there was a big zoo botanical garden amusement park and skate park After a few hours of visiting the above places we eventually made our way to the Childrens museum The museum is more suited for younger kids below 10 as our 11year old found it a little boring There were 3 levels in the museum and the kids had a lot of fun playing The staff stamped out hands on the way in so that we could reenter if we wanted to visit the cafe or restrooms Overall the place is very clean and accessible and I would recommend this to families with young children
10551,4,It was raining so there were not many people in the park Early April was the cherry blossom time and the visit was quite worthwhile despite the difficulty of taking photos with the lens getting wet every few seconds The amusement park was not in operation in the rain for safety
10552,5,This is the BEST MOST AWESOME CLEANEST WELLMAINTAIINED museum for kids My toddler 23months wnjoyed the toddlers area  crawling climbing sliding and pretend house play My 12 and 7 years old enjoyed the water play area construction area the wheel chair experience digital art and so much more We stayed 10am to 4pm and they still cant get enough It was really a fun fun day
10553,5,If you have kids this is definitely a worthwhile place to go  Can you imagine going to a park whereby one can do picnic comes with a zoo and an amusement park And thats not all its FREE Free except the amusement park rides  So do include a day to this place in your itinerary 
10554,5,Zoo botanical garden rainbow fountain are free of charge Amusement rides animal show and children museum requires entrance fees Springtime can see a lot of Cherry blossom flowers too A good place to have picnic here  Easy to spend half day here with family Suggest to spend a full day with young children
10555,5,There are so many things to do at Grand park We went in winter so spent most of our time in the childrens museum Amazing place to spend a few hours with a 3yr old and one year old I think it would be good for anyone up to 67 years Also superduper able Maybe 10 for the whole family  Lots of other great stuff in Grand park but most if the rest would be good in warm weather
10556,5,Huge park with play area zoo flower garden and science museum Its full day activity all family members will enjoy Must visit
10557,4,I have visited this place several times during my years in Seoul and had to get in one more before leaving The questionable rides with their knockoff paintings are a trip to check out
10558,5,Definitely a good place for kids to have fun there is a theme park and a zoo in this place so it should fill up the whole day
10559,5,Beautiful park that we were able to walk through to avoid the main road and all its noise Really peaceful and lots of places to drink and snack Plenty of toilet facilities as well
10560,5,The childrens museum was such an amazing place for kids One could easily spend the whole day at the museum and the park Be prepared to spend more than 3 hours here if you bring your kids to the museum because theres just so much activities for them to do Ticket were very reasonably priced which is a huge bonus point
10561,1,The park itself was fine but we were so disturbed by the living conditions of the animals at the zoo that we did not enjoy the overall visit The living spaces were incredibly small Three zebras were kept in an area smaller than most backyards It was very hot that day and we were saddened to see that few animals had areas to cool off in even a small pool of water Most of the animals were pacing back and forth in their tiny living spaces no doubt due to boredom one of the fox seemed to have an eye infection The elephant looked so sad and lonely Some had little shade and no grass This zoo would should reduce the number of animals and improve the condition of the animals by increasing living space and focusing on improved care
10562,5,This Park has it all including a zoo a childrens museum kids auto park amusement park with rides playground outdoor concert hall Anistory where they have playsmusicals and the Music FountainWe accessed this Park from the Seoul Childrens Grand Park Subway Station exit 1There are plenty of drink vending machines in the park and also a couple of small restaurants and canteens that sell food as well We ate at the Fried Chicken Restaurant thats located right next to the AnistoryWe spent about 20000 krw for a family of 4 Plus there are bathrooms with baby changing stations located all throughout the park which was very convenient If you go I would allocate at least 4 hours for this park but you could easily spend a whole day here
10563,5,You can easily spend the day in this huge park tons of things to view to taste to experience A top notch place for kids Strongly recommend
10564,4,Like the name Childrens Grand Park this place is suitable for kids and family Many attractions to be seen most of all are free We spent 35 hours was not enough you even can spend a whole day here for day to night to explore whole area  There are zoo theme park monkey bars garden many more  We need to come back to explore more  One thing that need to be improved is about food Need more stands  small stores that provide foods such as in myengdong street food
10565,5,this place is near my home and i usually go there for a walk this place is really nice they have a zoo too their but its not that big but enough to entertain you it is also a good place to workout
10566,4,After visiting Everland with its terrible queues i enjoyed Grand park for its quietness and free access there is a decent zoo which is FREE nice place to walk around eat sleep on the grass at sunny day very good fountain with music show
10567,5,An amazing childrens museum for a range of ages Went with two children aged 4 and 15 and both were enthralled by the mix of activities Set aside several hours to go floor by floor through the activities including those focused on construction space farming indoor maze etc Having visited similar museums in a half dozen countries this is by far and by a wide margin the best
10568,3,Its not a touristic must see destination but a good spot to spend a day with young kids doing various activities
10569,5,This is one of Seouls best values for the family or anyone really Its an old huge park that has many things to do for all types of people whether young or old One of the highlights is the amusement park which is not huge but good for children up to high school kids The rides arent huge but big enough for kids to enjoy and you can purchase single ride tickets too  Theres a smallish zoo that kids would love Also there are a couple of playgrounds for kids to romp around in If the weather is good I would recommend taking a day or half a day and walking around
10570,2,This large park in amongst the buildings is supposedly all about the kids There is an amusement park with rides a small zoo and theatre within the park The zoo is horrendous awful enclosures the animals are lacking stimulation I was mortified to see a vending machine selling food for the animals people were encouraged to feed the animals I saw some young adults throwing food at not to thr chimp and baboons Awful behavior The chimp enclosure is disgusting the guinea pigs had a better home Also the big cats and elephant have very small enclosures too It broke my heart Many exhibits were closed to prevent the spread of bird flu so the signs said Lots of old people meeting up for dating and walking group within the park The botanical gardens within the park were awful toototally indoors Not really a garden more like a green house I was disappointed by my visit
10571,5,Fresh air with many small lovely corners a place to visit when cone to Seoulvery close to Public transportation
10572,5,The place is big if you have young children walking from one end to another is a challenge  23 playgrounds One decent sized amusement park with a range of rides  The childrens museum is not expensive but is packed with 4 floors of displays and activities It is similar to the childrens museum in Ottawa There is enough English signage on the displays  We went in march so weather was still chilly and the foliage was bare It would be so much better in springsummer months
10573,5,Fun place to visit especially if you have kids with you Basically an allinone park They have several zoos playground very large and themed too picnic areas pools if I am not mistaken it was closed for maintenance when I was visiting lots of gorgeous plants and trees The area was welltaken care of I felt like I was in a TV show hahaha Awesome for kids as well I saw lots of kids having fun by themselves there Easy access to the subway Close to Sejong University where I was staying Admission was free I spent a good 2 hours just sightseeing Great for solo wanderers who wants peace from bricks and skyscrapers Also safe for female travelers They even have background music along their alleys Oddly creative I must say
10574,5,Among all the activities the lighting works in the fountain with music is remarkable After sunset you must spent some time there to make your trip unforgettable
10575,1,While this park is okay nothing too special the zoo area is totally depressing It can be really hard to see the animals penned in such small enclosures In Seoul there are dozens of other parks and even a better zoo I would really advise travelers to not go to this place If you want amusement rides you can find several other amusement parks in and around Seoul to visit that dont have such a sad portion to their park
10576,5,We stayed nearby the park I walked to Childrens park almost every morning until I checked out to hotel I couldnt believe my eyes that this park is really huge and grand To me it was amazing I love this park on top of all parks The feeling was good while walking really long up and down walk that you could actually explore many places in it  There was a cafe that you could get a good souvenir and helped the children from the other side of the world There was a massive grand orchestral open air hall that I sat there and listened to classical music scheduled and not open as yet especially in Winter depending on the time schedule  The breeze was so cool and warm sunshine The other side has tin man park with all unusual shapes and sizes in forming different art piece for adults and kids Wings chair playground and hopping scale towards the dustbins if you still have kids heart you know what Im talking about lol You too can play as it said adults are allow to play Please read the sign before playing and keep it tidy  There is a mini zoo but closed during Winter I was disappointed for not able to visit and botanica garden You might want to bring your kids or friends could visit during other season of time On the other side there was a huge theater and performance place that only opens at 10am Korea Time but I usually take my early walk and I skip this  Lots of people walking and exercising in this park You can go to a special training animal place and find out more when they open at 10am A water park centre is also there too By now you will be thinking are you serious YES I wish I could have more time for it There are pagoda some resting place a bridge many many sculptures and historical monuments also a garden of nice flowers Winter no longer can be seen  Dont miss the Cafe as you can see coffee seed plant at other season Music pieces too I love arts science and music with coffee and you would definitely see my reviews will be based on this  It was a good experience staying in the neighborhood with nice landlady good shoe seller aunty who is dedicated and lots of food surrounded Easy to get your amenities at the convenience shops too  Check this park out and I truly hope you will love it Entrance is free
10577,5,Seoul Children Grand Park is a good place to see Cherry Blossom on April Crowd but the space is big enough for you to take a rest eat some snacks sit in the grass and enjoy the beautiful Cherry blossom There is also a zoo inside the park Recommend visit on April
10578,5,We went during the MERS scare so it was quite empty but my husband and teenage daughter had such an amazing time
10579,5,We traveled to Seoul with 2 young kids for 5 days and mainly focused on things to keep the young ones occupied with The Childrens park  the adjoining museum were fantastic We ended up visiting it twice The Grand Park on a sunday had a carnivallike atmosphere with lots of stalls selling things food vendors as well as play zones The park offers upclose interaction with horses and a few other animals The wild animal enclosures were well maintained and my kids had a great time viewing their occupants We wrapped up our visit with a quick bite at a lovely little Italian restaurant just outside the Grand Park Great way to spend time in Seoul
10580,4,2nd largest park in seoul Many activities and sights to enjoy all for free For amusement park you gotta pay but i dont really recommend you Others are mostly free and just clean and wonderful place to visit Especially its real beauty on march to april due to flower season
10581,4,I currently live as an expat right beside the Childrens Grand Park I walk through it everyday This park is huge 3 km around as it used to be an 18 hole golf course One reason to visit the park is just to sit relax enjoy the sites zoo gardens amusement park exercise stations are good to see too but also its a great place to see how regular Seoul families enjoy their day off The kids are adorable the parents are attentive and the older crowd seem busy staying in shape If you can catch a lawn bowling tournament or a badminton game youre in for a full sight In July and August you may want to bring bathers or a set of dry clothes for little kids as theres a great streamwater pond to play in near the centre of the park And dont miss the flowers The park gardeners have done an excellent job ensuring theres always something in bloom Spring is especially pretty in cherry blossom season Use Subway Line 7 for easy access parking is a pain on the weekends
10582,4,This park has lots of activities including a few playgrounds different parks to walk through and play and a zoo which was free  that had all the big African cats tigers bears elephants monkeys and more The zoo enclosures allowed you to see the animals really close which was cool There is also an amusement park water play area lots of shaded picnic areas and also a paid childrens museum Area is quite large and you can rent strollers at the park for us3 a day which is good value Food outlets also on sight Worth a visit to entertain younger kids for a day Minus 1 star as the location is a bit far from the city centre  about 3045min taxi ride depending on traffic costs about us15 in orange taxi There is a subway train station out front which may be potentially quicker With it though given the large free play area and zoo for kids
10583,3,My child is six and wanted to spend most of his time at the amusement rides However he was deemed too short to ride most even with an adult  and even the dodgems which was a surprise So the rides were limited We also tried to go to a part of the park where kids can drive little cars but it was all shut up and didnt look to be used much We didnt get to the zoo part
10584,5,We came as a family of 3 with our 3 year old daughter We came here for the day My review is very similar to others  there are several playgrounds a water playground lots of gorgeous paths to walk an amusement park aimed at older children and adults as well as numerous places to grab a snack or drink It was easy to find as well We took Line 7 to Childrens Grand Park stop then exit 1 Park is free of admission unless your child wants to participate in the amusement area or ride an animal in the zoo If you are looking for somewhere that your kids can just run and play out some energy after a lot of sightseeing this is the perfect place
10585,4,Nice place to go with your family Nice food n fresh air You can make a nice picnic with your family with fun
10586,5,Prepare to spend a full day here The grand park is next to the childrens museum which is a separate attraction so you should plan to do both  The grand park is meant for kids and adults can enjoy the scenery with ample spaces and seats for picnics There are several attractions within the park itself We managed to only see the fountain at the entrance three life sizes tayo buses a sand playground with fun slides and swings and parts of the zoo which is free This is a great value for money attraction for visitors which is easily accessible by metro and surely enjoyable for children of all age groups  A definite recommendation for first time family visitors to Seoul with young children
10587,4,We had a great time here with my daughter The park has many playgrounds an amusement park and a zoo The amusement park you need to pay but it is reasonable prices and no line ups the day we went The zoo is nice and it is free
10588,5,We are foreigners living in Seoul and loved this gem Its very easy to get to from line 4 on the subway We came here to go to the zoo but we found much more here There is a great place for small kids to play indoors but that can be pricey I would avoid coming here on Jr sunny days though the walking can be brutal
10589,5,seoul childrens grand park It is okey Girl have a nice day Zoo Anistoty water garden and    All okey
10590,5,Our favorite stop on the trip if you have children My daughter enjoyed everything especially the water Something for everyone and even if you dont feel like walking around just sit if the fantastic place and let the kids run around Well maintained clean and facilitates we needed was easy to find
10591,5,Has a zoo as well as activity area for kids  in summer its a great attraction if its not raining zoo display includes elephants tiger and other members of the cat family Puma Panther Leopard etc Activity area has a fee that need sot be paid if you want to take the rides etc
10592,5,Loved the free zoo Animals are well kept and we saw different species of animals we couldnt see back home Nice and big playground area for the kids Can easily spend 23 hours there just spending time at the zoo and play areas and thats not even half of the park covered
10593,5,Good and fairly big park with zoo and playground it is quite a good option to visit with kids especially during spring and summer time there are enough foods outlets as well as toilets
10594,3,The place was huge We didnt get through it all in the 4 hours we were there The play areas we got to were nice I wouldnt really advise the zoo though We only made it to the monkeys and ferocious animal village Enclosures were small Most animals did not have toys or things for their entertainment The female lion was the only one and she looked so depressed The elephant had nothing to play with and was alone It just rocked back and fourth The red foxes looked mangey and malnourished A for the playgrounds F for the zoo Free or not no animal should be kept like that
10595,4,The kids have fun exploring the children mususem Had a number of themes  so very informative as well Highly recommended for kids  The park also has many playground for the kids to burn off their energy 
10596,4,Its a great place Lots of space and very green Kids will love the mini zoo with tigers lions and others Best of all its free
10597,2,Im not a vegan or some sort of animal hero but this place made me want to dive off a cliff I cant imagine how people rated this beyond Average Maybe I could say it is average They actually play terrible Kpop music through speakers as youre trying to walk through nature They hate foreigners personal experiences at least three times take my word for it or kill yourself because I dont care  watched families scream and throw bubble gum at animals watched Ahjumas stealing acorns when there were actual signs posted saying for humans not to steal the squirrel food and then when I went to the bathroom there were acorns scattered around from being washed in the bathroom  oh yeah the animals  depressing display Made me actually want to grab a sign and protest Christ maybe Im becoming sensitive Nope this place was hell AND Im a hunter fisher outdoorsman  so not your average HO complaining Go here just go here on a weekend and please dont kill yourself
10598,4,Well what would say to a park that has well kept and safe playgrounds plenty of greenspace and a zoo all for free I say its awesome and my children thought so too We stayed at a hotel called The Classic 500 Pentaz which was within walking distance to the park We found out about he park only by staying in the hotel and decided to give it a try Glad we did as it was a pleasant day out with the family I didnt have high expectations for a free park but this exceeded my expectations the zoo was a nice touch The zoo had a childrens zoo area with barnyard type animals and then there was also the larger African animals as well There is an amusement park within the park which we did not try since my children are too small but that area is at a cost which is to be expected  One thing that was not so good was that there seemed to be many many children on school trip excursions to the park and while the small children were not a problem the older children 15ish were running amok on the smaller kids playgrounds which made looking after toddlers all the more important Also the park is huge so plan how to return home before you go otherwise youll have to backtrack to the entrance in which you came as we had to do  If youre looking to burn a half day or so dont hesitate to drop by this park youll be pleasantly surprised
10599,5,The park was great lots of families and things to do The zoo was not huge but it is definitely the right size for kids There is a lot to do at the park for free We took the subway and carried our 2 year old for ease of subway travel We rented a stroller at the park for 3000 KW it was a bargain Great trip and park
10600,4,This park is designed as a kids atraction and has an amusement park section as well as ZOO and botanic sections There is a small recyckled art pathway and a fountain which is synchronised with music If you have some spare time its a nice place but dont make it your Top 10
10601,4,We brought our kids here on Childrens Day which meant the park was absolutely packed lot to do here nice playgrounds for toddlers is also great in the offseason when it is quieter
10602,5,Went there with a friend and had so much fun It reminded me of my childhood and made me feel like a child again This park is so big that even though i spend there whole day i still could see much more on my next visit
10603,4,CY  20160409  This park was established long time ago so the facility was a little old But this place was good to us because we have visited in childhood There had amusement park zoo and picnic place As compared with another big amusement park there was small but free On a fine day there was very good place to walk in downtown We visited for seeing cherryblossom thats great
10604,5,I find this park not only a fun place for children but also for adults   I went here last April 3 and experienced the wonderful spring colors especially the worlds famous cherry blossoms that lined the sides of the parks pathways Theres a place for childrens rides a science museum a mini zoo and a flower museum mini enclosed garden
10605,5,best place for cherry blossoms in the spring youll see all the school children with their matching vests and backpacks with their teachers it is the cutest thing The petals from the cherry blossom trees will rain over you while you walk down the streets but the free zoo is kind of depressing poor animals
10606,4,Best things about this park are that its close to the city centre and so very easy to get to by the metro and its FREE  We took line 5 on the metro which takes you to the back gate of the park but its still an impressive entrance gate There were fountains by the entrance and then more in the middle of the park which are what my daughter loved most and she got drenched so a change of clothing may have been a good idea There are also several play areas most of which are sandy so appropriate beachtype footwear would have been better than the shoes she went in but well know for next time  She didnt really like the zoo area much and the animal enclosures did look quite small which I often think is quite sad for the animals so I was quite glad she didnt want to spend too long in that part  We went on a Friday afternoon and the park was quite busy with groups of school children There were also quite a number of people who had taken picnics and popup tents to shield themselves from the very bright sun we werent very well prepared as I thought it was going to be a cloudy day and hadnt expected it to be so hot  We only went into 1 toilet block and ended up using the disabled toilet which had the type of toilet in that were more used to  the toilets in the ladies were squat style which I dont like and I knew would it would be disastrous to try to get my 5year old to use one of them
10607,4,Love love love the park Entrance fee is free so many things to see and do for family especially those with young kids The park is super clean as any other place in Korea a bit cold in winter but there are so many things to explore Our kids love the zoo the playground especially with the snow sled hill You need to pay to use the children play facilities but its a fair amount compare to the fun
10608,5,This park is super fun for little ones Entrance is free The park is clean and well maintained There are small playgrounds a well kept zoo and an animal performance that can be seen at a small fee I highly recommend this park to anyone with younger kids It is large so wear good walking shoes
10609,5,We visited this place on the weekdays and we loved this place If you have kids definitely you have to bring your kids here We visited the children museum and we could say the children museum was very good Kids could learn a lot of things while playing there
10610,5,There is a small zoo including sea animals a greenhouse landscaped walking paths all for free And if you get hungry you can stop by the cafe for hamburgers curry rice pasta and coffee at the entrance of the zoo We were a group of adult friends looking for a quiet relaxing way to have lunch and spend the afternoon I was not disappointed because it was a pretty place for photographs We went on 7 December 2015 and it was cold Im sure Spring or Summer or Fall season would be a perfect time to visit this place The train station stop is the same name on the Green Line
10611,2,Went on dec weekday Animal ride was closed amusement pak many rides were closed Big Playground under maintenanceauto rides park for kids was closed also  Kid was disaapointed as many activities look forward to couldnt be enjoyed No notice of closure on website also  The amusement park had many rides closed so we werent sure if 25k won whole park unlimited rides ticket was worth it Ended up only tried one ride  Animal section for kids was good for them to get up close and personal with feeding goats  Otherwise just enjoyed a leisurely stroll around the park
10612,5,The grand park is both a park and a zoo rolled into one The grounds are sprawling and you can take a nice leisurely walk while admiring wellkept greenery and an amazing zoo And you dont need to pay a single cent  The zoo section of the park is amazing You can roam freely around the park with the animals at close proximity You can feed the goats ponies and other tamed animals You can buy the feed from cute little vending machines at 1000 won or bring your own lettuce carrots and chopped apples There were many animals to view and interesting sections like the childrens zoo and animals school  Just a walk away is the Seoul Children Museum which houses 4 storeys of interactive fun for kids at an entrance fee  Food is affordable at the food courts all located conveniently In the vicinity  I love this place and its one of my favorites in Seoul
10613,5,It is easy to get to by metro  about15000won from downtown by cab Big open spaces cor children to run around but enough for adults to look at too Some small exhibitions art and so on as well Coffee stops of course The zoo is worthwhile  all animals seemed to be looked after  a few showed signed of boredom Easily a place for an afternoon in the sunand close to downtown Seoul too
10614,4,One of my favourite hangout in Seoul because its free and I am a kid at heart There is a mini zoo that features many more animals that you would expect from a park I usually visit with my friends when we just want to hangout but dont want to sit around and do nothing  Not advised to visit on weekends cause it will be super crowded Weekdays afternoons are the best
10615,4,It was a great zoo especially with kids It was overcrowded when we were there so we didnt stay longer than 34 hours The park is BEAUTIFUL especially in Fallhuge wellmaintained with plenty of trails for walking between the animals Youd have to come back more than once to see the whole place
10616,4,it can be difficult to find an ideal vacation destination that appeals to all family members Childrens grand park met all requirements of my 4yearold overallThe area of the park is quite large needing definitely stroller for kids which is available for rental thereThe main attractions is the zoo and amusement parkyour kids have a fun there for sure
10617,3,Its a park with zoo botanical garden amusement park etc I went to take a walk there and looked around There are a lot of families with young children there You can also see teens taking thrill rides at the amusement park The admission is free but you have to pay to enjoy the rides Overall it was really nothing much
10618,4,It amazes me to see any one or twostar reviews about this place I guess you cant please everyone However I really enjoyed taking my girlfriend here We were able to see some cherry blossoms check out some animals and walk through the botanical gardens Despite it being a drizzly day we had a great time Its a wonderful place to have a picnic take your family or have a date You can buy some snacks there or bring your own food Maybe its not an amazing park like you would see in London but I think its a fun place and you dont have to pay anything to get in
10619,5,Not a touristy place per se but for family with young children I highly recommend to visit  The park is huge really nice place to stroll around They have lots of attractions but due to weather in winter some are closed  Particularly love the childrens museum One of the best museum ive been too and my boy enjoyed it so much Very interactive and worry not everything come with english translation  Thing to note bring your own lunchfood The cafe sells ice cream n coffee only Unless you want to walk further out near the zoo there is an american style restaurant selling burger and pasta
10620,4,Location is wonderful which is just a few minutes walks from subway Amazingly it is free of charge large park not much animals but definitely is good for kids to learn between different species My family with 2 little kids spent half day over there and we liked it much
10621,1,We got there and the animals were all in tiny enclosures with visable signs of distress Most animals clearly looked unhealthy with fur missing or visable infections The animals had little or no water was disgusting and we left
10622,3,Park was huge with some animals It will be boring if you have visited places like Everland or Lotte World Can dropby for 2hrs or so if you have young children
10623,4,We have enjoyed going around this park its huge and has a lot of variety from flowers arts music zoo and surprised that we can ride a camel It is definitely a great experience for me and my family
10624,5,I was impressed by this park is not just for children but for adults its very interesting and I recommend
10625,5,No entrance fee need to paid for the facilities in the amusement parks Must go with kids if its your first trip to Seoul Can spend hald day easily in this park
10626,5,Its free to enter this outstanding park with many option to enjoy it It looks small at the entrance but definitely huge inside
10627,4,On a sunny day if you want to go out for picnic Seoul Childrens Grand Park is the spot you can visit The good thing is that there is no entrance fee There are zoo botanical garden experience spaces like adventure land gallery and more and amusement parkshould pay fees for using activities inside The amusement park is recently open after remodeling of 2 years You will have a full day with joy
10628,5,This park is located at the east of seoul city It is a very big park which is great for everyone As it is so spacious children are encouraged to run scoot or cycle Light refreshment can be found near the entrance but it is advisable to bring along some light refreshment as you enjoy the grand park
10629,5,If you want to see everything then plan to stay the whole day there Number 1 attraction inside the park is the childrens museum it is not actually a museum it has interactive kids activities through which they may learn everything about many subjects including science art  creation Also the park has got a dancing fountain theme park and zoo
10630,5,A free zoo animal feeding areas big playground cherry blossoms  what more can one ask for  Wouldve also wanted to visit the Childrens Museum but we didnt have enough time In any case why coop yourself up in a building with all the glorious spring sun shining down from heaven
10631,5,They have two areas for snow sledging and many other activities for kids Well worth the entrance fee If you cant make it to the ski resort this is a good alternative for kids to play with snow
10632,5,the park is very big that children can spend whole day  there also some winter sport for children from dec to march small zoo and children museum inside there is an entry fees for the museum but we didnt visit because not enough time
10633,4,Now like any park area in Seoul its really busy and crowded on the weekends so if you get a chance to go midweek that is my advice They have all the same animals in the zoos and all the same attractions so if you want to be able to walk around and enjoy then avoid the weekends The Zoo is pretty good some animals i wish that they had more space to run around and a little cleaner place to live but they do have a good variety of wildlife There is a nice botanical garden and the grounds are really kept well This is a place to have a picnicDuring the spring the cherry trees all blossom and its a really nice place to go but this place can be see yearround Enjoy cause its worth the trip and bring your sneakers cause there is alot of area to cover
10634,4,If you would like to have an halfday outing with the kids Childrens Grand Park excluding the amusement park can be the choice We took a subway from Hapjeong station to the Children Park station exit 1 There was no entrance fee incurred However fee was charged for camel  pony riding amusement park and character world Upon entrance we were greeted by the awesome autumn scenery with colorful orange yellow and red leaves on the tall trees The junk art caught our eyes along the way to the mini zoo Due to limited time we did not visit the water park and amusement park The stage performance by some musicians halted my elder son from leaving the park ealier It was an enjoyable trip for small kids
10635,4,Really nyc place especially for kids The entire walk in the zoo is also refreshing The dolphin show n d rose garden r the highlights of this park U ll get to see almost all the animals highly recommended for animal lovers 
10636,4,If you find Lotte World  Everland is too busy  crowded suggest you to visit this place with your childredn especially to see cherry blossom in April Frankly speaking I didnt expect there were so many cherry trees before visiting The cherry blossom was very awesome and eyecatching The most important was that this park was big enough to let the visitors to have enough space to walk around  appreciate this beautiful blossom Have fun in this park
10637,5,Date of Visit 20130921 My two young boys loved the park from the Animals Sculptures Exhibits and the food Unfortunately for us the area where the carousel and rides were as seen in the Gangnam Style music clip were in a section that had been closed off and it was being redeveloped However that aside it is well worth attending
10638,4,It was very hot outside but our children wanted to have fun anyway Plus It was summer vocation time in Korea So every attraction sight was crowded with millions of people So this park was good not too many people they went into special fountain which was very fun and cool x They had a nice zoo but the park is going to be much more exiting in 2014 when the restoration will be over
10639,1,We went as a way to fill a spate day in the city Yes it is free but from Seoul station its a long metro ride with many changes We got there and the animals were all in tiny enclosures with visable signs of distress Most animals clearly looked unhealthy with fur missing sores on their skin or visable infections The animals had little or no water Was disgusting and we left Armament park wasnt open Give it a miss
10640,3,The amusement center in the park is closed for renovation should be closed for another 6 more months at least by the looks of it  The kids play facilities are quite decently maintained considering its free  Zoo have quite fair variety of animals on display  Worth a visit if there is a spare slot in your time schedule
10641,4,My niece was so excited when visiting this park She could see touch and play with animals in a huge space There are some that she had never experienced such as Camel Riding It should be one of the most memorable in her childhood
10642,4,From the subway station exit the main entrance to this park is just a short walk away Entrance is free Even before entering the park you will be immediately amazed by wonderful flowers on the way to its entrance gate There were lots of school children when we went here but it did not feel crowded at all owing to the parks large space The zoo was great It had a lot of animals The restaurants food were ok and reasonably priced
10643,4,This park has a lot to see and do There is a zoo amusement rides and botanical gardens There is also a childrens museum on the grounds It is definitely geared towards the younger kids but there is plenty to see and do for all ages
10644,2,Its a great place for people to go to relax but i would NOT ever go their again because if you want to encorage animal crulty then by all means go i wont stop you but it breaks your heart to see great beautiful animals locked up in cages with not nearly enough room to run in youl see it in the wolves the lions ect but what bugged me the most was that sad miserable look in the coyotes eyes and that makes you never want to go to a zoo again so i didnt like it but other people might but dont go and do it for the animals
10645,5,I have been to Everland and I paid so much for a family of 5 to play on the skip slope for my children Its very rush to wake up in the morning and the tour bus will pick you up from the hotel and it takes about 1hr and 30mins to reach there and by 3pm they want you back on the bus to bring you to some other places to buy some ginseng Go to this place call the Childrens Grand Park but its actually the Zoo There they have verything that Everland have and you can take your own sweet time going there by train on the Dark green line and stop at station 726 You will enjoyed and never regret going Take the open air cable car up to the mountains Its beautiful and many many more  Jimmy Ng
10646,5,We stumbled across this place and was quite surprised Its a great free theme parkZoo for both young and old The monkeys were great I did wonder about some of the enclosures being very small and other people have questioned it so I hope they do look after them well Some parts of it were a bit runned down but its definately a great place to visit or walk through They do put the animals away later in the day as we found out so keep in mind the closing times  A Must visit if you are in the area If you are in guesthouses nearby its a great day out without travelling too far
10647,5,I must give it to Korea they know how to make AWESOME childrens parks I cant say enough about how wonderful this park is Amusement park zoo playgrounds etc The park is free but some of the attractions cost but it is worth it if you are trying to see the sights as well as please the children Our son could have spent days at this park and never seen all the attractions Although its a long subway ride its totally worth it
10648,5,This place is a perfect location to take your family for a day out We found the grounds to be lovely to walk and many places for children to play The fact that it is free to get in is amazing We planned on staying the day and riding the rides however they were closed due to construction We managed to still spend the entire day strolling thru the park Very pleasant day for a stroll  CAUTION if you are an animal lover such as I am then you will want to AVOID THE ANIMAL AREA The cages as well below par tiny dirty and the animals have lost their will to live They all look depressed an unhealthy After spending a beautiful day at the park this saddend me to see the welfare of these poor defenseless helpless animals I would not recommend the animal areas to anyone I wish citizens of Seoul would take action for these animals
10649,4,The Childrens grand park is quite easy to findaccess and the entry is free making it a suitable place for a nice stroll or activities with the family Although some are a bit outdated theres plenty of activities to do including theme park rides zoo botanical gardens playgrounds and plenty of places to eat The place is quite isolated in winter which can be both a plus and a minus
10650,4,A great place to relax and enjoy peace and happiness The park makes you feel happy and carefree If you enjoy walking and viewing nature this is a good place It is conveniently located at a subway entrance so easy to get to I particularly enjoyed the walking paths but the best thing was the water fountain dancing to the music The music was super and the show was entertaining Unfortunately I didnt see the major attractionszoo etc but the park is beautiful
10651,4,free entry good large theme park easy to access
10652,5,I liked that there is baby strollers for rent very clean territory nice zoo camel riding for children
10653,3,We visited this park in Seoul because it was free and we wanted to see the music fountain To see the lit up fountain with sound effects was cool but there was so much morepeople go there to do some dance as a group done by community workers i guess  my daughter joined in and had a great time The zoo was a bit old but still enjoyablethere is some rides for kids as well
10654,5,The Childrens Grand park is grand It is free to get in There are tons of different themed areas and the entire place is covered in huge trees so its a beautiful place just to walk through Theres an adventure land with lots of play structures a zoo botanical garden pony donkey and camel rides an amusement park a marine animal exhibit an animal show and many more We ate at the botanical garden cafeteria My son and I had pasta carbonara for 6000 won each and it was delicious My husband had a burger which was actually two smaller patties side by side I believe his was about 7000 won for the burger fries and drink he said it was good but he was not as ecstatic over his meal as I was about mine I was just happy that they had pasta which is one of the few things my 3 year old will eat There were many family mart vendors around so finding a drink when you needed one was easy The restrooms were very clean and always nearby We went to the amusement park and opted for single ride tickets 3000 won for each ride for our son and 4000 won for each ride for us we only rode a few rides My husband and I took turns on the roller coaster which was really fun And our son rode the kiddie truck ride and the carousel You can also buy a combo ticket for 5 rides I believe it was 12000 won for children and 15000 for adults Or you could buy a ride all day bracelet which I believe was 20000 and 25000 for children and adults but those prices may not be exact Our most favorite part of the park was the polar bears in the marine exhibit they swim right up to the glass and being that close to such a huge animal is amazing Also we really enjoyed the camel ride I rode with our 3 year old son and it was 8000 for the two of us Our son rode a donkey by himself for 3000 won and a gentleman led the donkey around and held onto our son to be sure he stayed on We also went to the animal show called Anistory It is a cross between an animal show and the cinderella story It was 8000 for each my husband and I and our son was free So it cost us 16000 won to see and although it was entertaining I didnt feel that the show was worth that much If you go to the Seoul Zoo you should see the dolphin show very entertaining and only 2000 won per person We only saw one souvenir shop but didnt find anything we wanted to buy But altogether the experience was a fun one and I would recommend it to anyone even those without children 
10655,4,Children Grand park can be really fun for the kids There is always something to do or play Ours are 4 6 and 9years old and have always fun there There is a little fun fare too and a nice playground If you go there on weekdays when it is less crowed then the kids have fun
10656,5, There are 30000 roses each I like to relax 
10657,5, A leisurely promenade Seoul Land an art museum and a zoo and a forest bathing area Dullegil and lakegil a good place to take a walk or exercise 
10658,5, One of the most beautiful parks ever in three sections amusement park zoo and flower garden 
10659,5,Seoul Grand Park is also known as Seoul zoo Its a beautiful place but be sure not to reach after 5pm Lots and lots of animals were close when I reached after 5pm It states close at 7pm But many enclosures like the bear tiger etc were 
10660,5, It was so good and there were no people because it was hot when I went on a weekday and there were a lot of animals out there When I went to the zoo or Seoul Land I could take an elephant train or a lift but it 
10661,2, Its summer and the animals are wet There are many empty cages There are many construction sites but satisfaction is low 
10662,5, A lot of people were having fun Hmm it was difficult because the weather was too hot 
10663,5, fun and enjoyable time is running out 
10664,5,very big territory a lot of animals comfortable  places for resting
10665,5,Very beautiful Kids like there so much
10666,5, Tickets for the flower garden zoo and several places combined within 10000 won per adult children respectively with a discount Its better to come here before lunch time and its not a fact that you can view 
10667,5, the garden is good The elephant train man is speeding 
10668,5,We took the cable car ride into the zoo The ride itself is great as it saves you the trouble of having to walk up to the zoo and you get to enjoy the scenery The zoo itself is very huge and can be quite tiring to walk all day The animals 
10669,5,More animals
10670,5,Best park in Seoul
10671,3, A place that does not change over time But now it looks like a change is needed 
10672,5,Good service beer and food
10673,4, The perimeter is gentle and easy to walk Its on the outskirts of the zoo but a leisurely two and a half hours is enough It is good to go to the dam and rest at the octagonal pavilion 
10674,5,RlP
10675,5, Compared to Incheon Grand Park near my house there were so many things to see and it wasnt a waste of money From birds to reptiles to lions and elephants there is no animal without it 
10676,5, How long does it take to go out with children the parking lot is convenient and very very good 
10677,5,Great place for freedays
10678,2, The zoo is spacious so its nice to walk around but there arent many animals so the child is a little disappointed Dont get sick animals

10685,5, You can freely observe animals in a spacious and open space There are many trees around so it felt like taking a walk 
10686,5, Its a good place for a walk in all seasons There are many people resting on mats everywhere 
10687,5, I like it especially since I am traveling with children and when I walk a little slowly and look around I see wonderful things I cant take pictures of the surroundings because its when the child is running 
10688,5, Is there anywhere to go on a date Even if youve been go back and study Its always a new place  
10689,1, From the main entrance to the elephant train ride there is a long staircase so the whole family can go up with a stroller If you dont do well you go up and roll down 
10690,3, I do not recommend for young people For families most likely for children 
10691,5, For children under elementary school there is no better place than this If you have a car Seoul Land 
10692,5, Go to Seoul Grand Park Zoo  Elephant Train  Zoo Admission Ticket  Lift Discount if you pay at once It is best to take the lift to the top of the zoo and look around while coming 
10693,3, The parking lot has been changed to an unmanned system Dadongi card discount

10699,5, Its great to run around with the kids From 1000 in the morning it gets crowded come early 
10700,5, A good place to go to feel the autumn mood comfortably with gimbap 
10701,5, The parking fee is 2000 won through Kakao t so it is not burdensome 
10702,5, Good Spacious and lots of places for picnics The parking lot is spacious too 
10703,4,The park and zoo is so wonderful Amazing view can be seen while you are sitting in the skylift In the zoo you can find many kind of animals you can travel inside the zoo by the provided bus The park is clean and tidy it is well 
10704,4, Even Seoul Grand Park is bitterly expensive There are a lot of people so in spring waiting for the parking lot is usually an hour 
10705,4, It is spacious and there are many animals so it is good for a family outing 
10706,4, Its perfect for going out with family friends and lovers Its okay to simply prepare a picnic The sun is hot so a sun screen is essential I was dragging a stroller and a 
10707,5, There were a lot of people but yes I made good memories 
10708,5, There are many people but it is spacious and the environment is very good 
10709,5, Daegu villager has business in Seoul and travels with family If you want to go as far as riding go early 
10710,4, It takes a lot of time to get to parking No cheetahs Good for cherry blossom viewing 
10711,5, The newly created Hero Garden at the entrance of Seoul Grand Park is wonderful 
10712,5, I like to go with my family If youre not going early in the morning take the subway 
10713,4, There are two downsides Its so wide its hard to get around there is nothing to eat 
10714,5, The best zoo in Korea I think the animals are bigger than before 
10715,5, The child liked it It is a suburb of Seoul so it is easy to move around and it is good for a day trip 
10716,5, wide There are many and many animals There is a place where you can rest in between so you can do a quick yogi and it was so good 
10717,5, It is a good place with convenient transportation and lots of things to do and see 
10718,5, I went to the water park with my daughter and the next day so I wanted to go to the zoo Its a good place to visit with my family It seems to be getting better after the new change 
10719,5,Really like the park My boy had a fun and happy time there
10720,1, It is a large and well maintained park with many animals Guidance and safety personnel should be located throughout 
10721,4, Winter And since it was the weekend all the animals were inside It would be good to check the time and day of the week program carefully 
10722,5, It is a cityrun park with the largest number of animals in Korea and the Gwacheon Science Museum etc Play facilities that children and students will love 
10723,4, What kind of corona was not open I did not even open it Except for children who are only in the zoo they were  
10724,4, Animals are so sad You can meet animals indoors until 4 oclock and outdoors until 5 oclock and the elephant train is the last train at 510 
10725,4, It wasnt crowded and it was a great viewing However it was a disappointment that we could not see many animals because it was winter and Corona 
10726,5, Good location and good atmosphere Besides the clerk is friendly 
10727,5, There are many animals and it is good Unless it is a very cold winter I think it will be fine 
10728,3, Im worried about traffic jams because its an outside road 
10729,5, It is a place to go every Friday for a healthy walk and it is the best as a walking course for the elderly 
10730,3, It was hard to see the animals today because the time was not right There werent many people so it was quiet 
10731,5, The zoo is too big to see all at once Use the lift to visit the zoo with children And the walking trail in the Grand Park is very nice  
10732,5, When I was young I went to Seoul Grand Park holding my mom and dads hands Now where I go with my daughter Raft tastes a bit risky but fun 
10733,5, Tigers are particularly active The desert fox and the desert mouse next door are so cute The seals are so cute you dont even notice the passing of time 
10734,1, There was nothing to see I went to see the crocodiles but I was only able to see them on weekdays 
10735,4, Quiet and quiet great for kids to go to these days because of Kona and Chuuui if you go to Yaha animals dont come Book the weather 
10736,4, Animals dont come out much because of Koryona and Cold And if you buy the lift package go to the top and then walk slowly its a little more convenient 
10737,3,Armored during the weekends
10738,5, Ive been to the Grand Park Zoo but its quiet and its nice to go for a walk and see animals Dont expect too much 
10739,4,Good
10740,3, The stairs are very inconvenient when going to the elephant train from the parking lot Especially if you have a stroller or wheelchair 
10741,4, In the morning there were no animals so it was absurd You can only see it at 2 or 3 in the afternoon 
10742,5, The weather was good people watching was good This is my first visit in 20 years 
10743,4, Cassowary Leah its nice to see you It was late autumn so it was a bit gloomy Due to the corona quarantine the Botanical Hall and South America Hall were 
10744,4, The zoo ticket is 5000 per person The plant is 2000 The indoor pavilion is not open But when I walked around with my family I saw a lot of animals It was very good I walked up and took the cable car I was very 
10745,5, Spacious good value for money kids love it I want to go again 
10746,5, The trail is well established and the occasional roar of wild beasts is realistic 
10747,5, If youre struggling with people like me because youre eating and buying you dont know if youre going to end up like this Just turn around and youll feel like youve become a faithful smurf Thank you for always 
10748,3, Animals in the zoo exhibit severe repetitive behaviors due to stress This phenomenon is more severe in carnivores than in herbivores 
10749,5, Anytime is a good place to go Seoul Grand Park which I visited in late autumn still has autumn leaves so it was good to take a walk 
10750,5, I went up to the top of the Seoul Zoo on the skylift to see the zoo and I seem to be more fascinated by the beautiful autumn leaves than the animals 
10751,5, no one was nice Is it winter or is it Corona It was a bit disappointing that there were no places to eat 
10752,4, I think they will like it if you bring the kids Healing 
10753,5, The autumn leaves restaurant is Seoul Grand Park haha Its really pretty 
10754,5, goooooood It was good to visit after a long time I want to go again 
10755,5, A place where you can feel the autumn mood well There is no entrance fee for the Dullegil but it starts next to the entrance to the Grand Park and comes out in front of the museum 
10756,4, A popular park for photographers A good place for general visitors every day crowded 
10757,5, Its a great place to go with kids It is better to go when the weather is not cold 
10758,4, Its the beginning of hibernation so I cant see many animals 
10759,5,must go
10760,5, Seoul National University Park is so large that you can run and play And Seoul National University Park has a zoo Seoul Land and a large parking lot 
10761,4, I went to the Dullegil behind the Grand Park The air is good and the road is good  
10762,5, I passed by the cable car but its nice to have a wide variety of facilities The cable car was a little scary 
10763,5, The autumn leaves are so pretty I also like the sound of stepping on it 
10764,2, I visited last weekend and had a really good time with my family but I am deducting 3 stars because of the crazy way the parking lot was managed 
10765,3, The zoo is similar to the previous one but the parking fee settlement is changed from prepaid to postpaid and it takes too long to get out 
10766,5, Do you want to see the autumn leaves my dear go now 
10767,5,One of the best place to hangout So many spots including zoo side skydive museum and many more Must have to visit beside with your children
10768,3, close too early The lift staff are unfriendly 
10769,4, Coffee and bread to drink while taking a walk are delicious Parking is a bit inconvenient 
10770,5, The first time I went to Seoul Grand Park with Ina  I love it 
10771,5, I went to see the autumn leaves with my family Its so good Ride the nostalgic lift and see animals Everything was good except for the food in the restaurant in the park 
10772,5,Worth to spend the weekend with
10773,5, I like to walk and walk The parking lot is spacious and there are Seoul Zoo Seoul Land and the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art Gwacheon 
10774,5, Everyone pay attention to that redneck Very cute and satisfied Good for walking and good weather 
10775,4, The parking lot is complicated so using the subway is the answer 
10776,5, You can see a variety of animals You can see many kinds of animals here 
10777,5, Weekend visitors to Seoul Grand Park must get a headache from parking Only a few selected people can park where you can see in the last picture  
10778,4,All the activities in 1 place
10779,4, Skylift is highly recommended I like autumn leaves flowers in the theme park and cherry blossoms in spring 
10780,5, I couldnt enter the botanical garden but it was so fun and pretty and I came back 
10781,5,beautiful trees in fall Very good to take pictures
10782,5, Satisfied just walking around the Dullegil for money The downside is that there are no restaurants nearby 
10783,4, The autumn leaves at the zoo are changing I want to visit again in November 
10784,2, everything was good I saw the animals and the environment was good However as soon as you pass the entrance there is a restaurant in front of the 
10785,5,Good
10786,5, I walked up when I went up and took the lift  elephant train when I came down and it was so much fun 
10787,4, Very large park very suitable for coming when the weather is good Bring children back to Korea and dont forget to visit ZOO Its a bit inconvenient when the weather gets cold Fortunately Seoul Grand Park is very 
10788,5, Because it is cold there are no animals The entrance is under construction but the fresh air is so good Its a pity that the jaguar went crazy 
10789,4, Lots of people in the afternoon but not many people in the morning It is possible to load a stroller on an elephant train but it is very 
10790,5,Great for exercising  Less crowded when we visit
10791,4, I went on a weekday and there were few visitors so I enjoyed it leisurely It is also a good place to go as it is easily accessible by transportation 
10792,5, Among the zoos Ive been to it has the least smell and has a variety of animals Above all the scenery is very nice 
10793,5,lovely place specially for kids
10794,5, Reservation is easy and I went fishing for zucchini with my children and it was so much fun 
10795,3,Its too hard to go around with babiesbut its fun
10796,5,A good expirience for children and family bonding
10797,5, A great place to go with kids Its good to let the kids loose and play 
10798,5,Best place for family trip in weekend Dont miss sky lift There are 4 lines Choose line which has longest route
10799,4, Its good for kids to run around and if only I could change the bathroom soap a little its not even the 80s 
10800,5, Its a bit far but its good  There are a lot of rare animals 
10801,5, Spacious Clean Diverse A zoo that cares about animals Its been a few decades since I went The natural scenery is a healing place 
10802,5, A representative park near Seoul You can enjoy the nature changing throughout the four seasons and it is an optimized place for families of all ages men and women to spend a day A park where Saulland and the 
10803,5, A 3yearold boy is totally obsessed with the elephant train 
10804,1, Fish oil There are a lot of people in this country and the road is narrow because it is under construction 
10805,5, it was good Its free before 36 months If you ride the elephant train and lift you have to pay 30000 won  
10806,5, If I say good good my mouth hurts Its Kosi Guk but I only wore a mask haha so many people 
10807,5, One of the best places to take children under 10 years old There are a lot of animals and there are benches and shade in the middle so there are many people who enjoy laying on mats 
10808,4, Why is Seoul Grand Park in Gwacheon This is a zoo and botanical garden on a vast land Lots of things to see and eat 
10809,5, Considering the costeffectiveness its just light However looking at the food sold inside you can see a strong will to make up for the deficit in the admission fee 
10810,4, Considering that it is a public facility it is satisfactory You can see the efforts of the people who run it and the facilities are very old but they are improving little by little During the holidays there are 
10811,5, Being able to get acquainted with animals Its good for kindergarten and elementary school students And going for a walk 
10812,4, I had fun with my child To go to the zoo and not see an elephant 
10813,4, There were so many people I respect my father and mother 
10814,5, Impressed every time I go A place where nature art and play coexist Its a great place to go with kids and friends and its a place I want to go often 
10815,4, As it is a municipal park the entrance fee is good There are a lot of people who ride the elephant train but if it is not in the scorching sun it is possible to get around on foot However it is recommended to 
10816,5, You must take the lift at the beginning Just because I rode the elephant train didnt mean I was an expert 
10817,4, It was less because it was outing and outdoors but I wish the distance between the lift waiting line was kept a little better

10819,5,Fantastic zoo
10820,5, Its Corona but its a lot of people and its spacious so its good to go Childrens sand play area is the most popular 
10821,5, It is very big there are many things to see and the skylift was cool and the view was good Its a pity that the restaurants food was expensive and tasteless 
10822,5, there was construction When entering take a transportation card and pass quickly It was sensational 
10823,4,  
10824,5,Just loved it
10825,4, I couldnt see all the details using the lift and the elephant car but the security guards were all the best to enjoy the view 
10826,5, It is a resting place for citizens around Seoul and a place where you can see animals from all over the world 
10827,5, It is well maintained for walking and visiting the zoo with children 
10828,3,I could feel the old memories The facility is old
10829,5, It is a place where you can fully enjoy the feeling of early autumn After 3pm its free and good 
10830,5, A great place for families with young children Especially the zoo and theme park Recommend 
10831,5, It was nice that the childrens lounge was well maintained The child loved going to the zoo 
10832,5,Been there to zoo portion Amazing place for kids
10833,5, A place that children love It is recommended to take a gondola ride and see it while descending from the top 
10834,4, Well Seoul Grand Park is always nice Except for expensive food and snacks And the parking fee has gone up 
10835,3, It was a pity because there were so many empty kennels Maybe it was because there were not as many visitors as before Or should I rather be happy with the many empty kennels The leopard kennel was 
10836,4, Its difficult to walk around but each course is well documented in the brochure so its easy to find 
10837,4,Good place
10838,5, September 19 2021 Today is fun but suddenly its afternoon so its hard to line up because there are so many people Still its fun to go after 2 years I think its better to go when there are fewer people next 
10839,4, Sleeping animals and humans trying to see Nervous The response of Iron Man at the entrance and exit is very good 
10840,5, Rhinoceros Elephant Cuteness desert fox sleep 
10841,5, Although it was a weekend there were not many people than expected Kids love it so much 
10842,5, A large zoo a cable car Interesting for children and adults At the moment all closed rooms are not working due to the virus nevertheless most of the animals are available for viewing There are shops on the 
10843,1, I have a good time with my granddaughters and grandchildren everything is perfect 
10844,5, Its wide and there are animals on the trail so its good 
10845,3,Covid Half of the zoo animals are not present
10846,4, Kakao started parking management and the parking fee increased by 2000 won turn off cacao 
10847,5, Its the perfect place to go out in the fall Be sure to enjoy the light festival in the evening 
10848,5, good facilities A little lacking in food Large space and various animals 
10849,5, Seoul Zoo is a top destination for walking in the bosom of nature The air is clean filled with wonderful aromas and amazing natural smells the vegetation is so diverse that you stop and cannot get away from these 
10850,4,Beautiful grand park
10851,3, Seoul Grand Park is always good But its a little bit out of control I cant erase the feeling 
10852,4, The lift is quite expensive The line is long and the cost is poor Elephant train is good 
10853,5, It was raining so the weather was cool and there were plenty of places to rest in between but it was a bit disappointing because there were many animals that werent even outdoors 
10854,5, Its the first time Ive seen a pelican eating food up close like this 
10855,5, I think this is that we are a life that suits us very well Its because eating refrigerator hepatitis takes us because it knows that I like to see a letter where it is found Those who are interested in the United 
10856,5, It is a place full of things to see but unfortunately there are too many people 
10857,2, Unfortunately I think the cages of the animals are too small and they dont look very happy and healthy either But at least the park is nice 
10858,5, Its past 5 oclock and the animals are allowed to enter so the animals must rest but its a pity 
10859,4, like I saw it when I was young and its been 30 years since Ive been there I think Im doing better than I thought 
10860,5, I couldnt look around because there were a lot of people but I think Ill play properly when Corona gets better The lift was really fun 
10861,5, Its so good its hot hahaha The wind is cool now Cable carjjang 
10862,5, A place where you can feel comfortable comfortable and breathe life as if you were at a villa at any time 
10863,4, Its been a while since Ive been here and have a good time Its a bit disappointing that all the interiors are closed due to the corona 
10864,1, Convenience store friendliness is the worst The first convenience store on the right side of the front door is the worst 
10865,5,Hard
10866,5, Its a hot day but the trees are thick so theres a lot of shade when walking on the road 
10867,5,Super
10868,5, The parking lot is fully equipped and there are many toilets so it is good for a big and fun family outing 
10869,5, All the animals were there A fun place for kids and adults alike All the animals were there A fun place for both kids and adults 
10870,5, It was a great experience to see various animals up close 
10871,5, Very big and beautiful garden I highly recommend it to those who travel to Seoul 
10872,5,Good
10873,4, It was a weekday so there were no people but it was a pity that the snack facility was closed 
10874,4, I love the zoo The restaurant doesnt sell delicious food and its almost closed You need to bring a packed lunch 
10875,5, Elephant train and lift ticket package It looks good with a ticket Its very spacious not many animals now 
10876,5, Walk in the forest for ten thousand steps in the forest bathing area 
10877,5, As long as you have the stamina you cant really spend a day here There is also a small water play area basic animal viewing toilets and lots of shops Really recommend this place 
10878,5, It is recommended for a walk I visit the zoo at least once but there is not much to eat inside They sell simple snacks at the kiosk at the entrance of the Childrens Zoo Rose Park I recommend to 
10879,5,Great experiencepro tip take the elephant train
10880,5, Its cheap theres a lot to see and its a mustgo place for those with children 
10881,5,The sky lift over the lake at this season  no flowers no snow  alone was worth the visit The lake was frozen at the edges The calmness and reflections were peaceful We bought a package ticket However it only included one ride between the zoo and the zoo entrance or between the zoo entrance and the main entrance Would recommend to save th the ticket for the latter ride  The zoo was bigger than imagined There was a good variety of animals and more than 6 tigers The living conditions of some animals were not as satisfactory
10882,5,The Seoul Grand Park has a good zoo and rose garden I did not see roses in past visits but this time late Oct the rose garden was filled with roses In autumn the autumn colours are fascinating However this year was dry and the summer was unusually long so the ginkgo and maple trees were much less attractive than last year I like the park because it has a bird house where one could see various birds face to face ie not caged The zoo is very large and has a wide range of animals
10883,5,We went there to visit the Zoo we ended up visiting the whole place and spend the whole day there The zoo is big and there is a lot to see There is a sky lift that goes over a huge distance with amazing views We did not expect something so nice  we were also lucky to go there in autumn when all the leaves were changing and the views were incredible Definitely go even just for the sky lift ride  it was amazing
10884,5,To access this area I would recommend using the lift as it provides an aerial view of the zoo Within the zoo there are many animals on display from giraffes elephant lion etc The zoo is well kept and the grounds are so pleasant to walk through There are even some activity areas such as a rock wall and elephant trunk slide
10885,4,Easter weekend travel to Seoul Korea and we knew we would have to visit the Seoul Zoo during April my daughter loves animals and zoos we came here in Dec 2018 and it was too cold and the animals were all housed inside so it wasnt fun last time but this time it was amazing  The weather was very nice sunny and cool no icy floor the cherry blossoms were still in effect so lots of people were still taking pictures all the animals were out and about instead of locked in large rooms  Kids get in free so when we went there was many school children which was very nice to see them enjoy the park
10886,5,The park has been one of my favorites in Seoul It had been under renovation for many months but fortunately the renovation was completed when I went there in early Nov 2018 The aviary was extensively altered Now the visitors are isolated from the birds by glass panels However some new species have been added I like to go there in late Oct or early Nov as the maples and ginkgo trees create a beautiful mix of red orange and yellow colors The park is very large and I like the zoo most To save walking it is better to take the chair lift to the top and then walk down the hill Once back to the zoo entrance I usually take the chair lift back to the main entrance around sunset time The view from the chair lift of the lake at sunset is fascinating
10887,2,I love visiting zoos and seeing different animals However I recommend not visiting this zoo I travelled 15 hours to get here and I feel like my time travelling and visiting was wasted There were many different animals which was probably the best point Each enclosure was small dirty and there was no sign of a zookeeper anywhere Usually on my visits to the zoo I see many zookeepers tending and feeding the animals but during my visit here I didnt see any Many animals looked sad and hungry often eating dry leaves The monkeys were also acting out at each other probably because the cages were so small As I mentioned I love to visit the zoo just not this one
10888,5,About an hour bus ride from Seoul is the Seoul Grand Park with Zoo It is a fun place for friends and families The place is huge and so many animals to see You will see bears elephants birds and a lot more The entrance fee is not that expensive which comes with a free ride to the zoo bus and skylift It goes uphill so you will get tired going up so be sure to bring some water and snacks to replenish
10889,4,It is a place where you can touch see and enjoy animals Especially in spring and fall season you can see flower rosechrysanthemum and use the elephant train to get to the entrance quickly and the family can go on a picnic
10890,4,This is a park in massive area which includes multiple different attractions The zoo has most visitors and is a pretty good place to any ages  Facilities Zoo Garden Camping Zone Seoul LandAmusement Park Contemporary Museum etc We only entered the zoo But there was a rose garden as a season special and it looked nice too  Location This is in Gwacheon City But only 4 stops away from Metro Sadang Station line 4 Accessibility is great from Seoul From the metro station its a short walk to the park There are some food stalls in the way Its fun to watch and I recommend having foods here because foods inside the park are much more expensive  Zoo  We bought combined ticket of 10500 won for a lift a elephant bus and an entrance After buying the ticket go to the lift station on the right and take the lift until the highest area of the zoo Walk around the zoo and take the bus when its done This seems to be the best way to save money   The zoo was fine Food stands bathrooms benches are everywhere Bird Zone is like a Jurassic Park If you are lucky youll be able to see parrots very closely We were very amused to see apes I think Ape Zone is the best part in this zoo   I was a bit disappointed not to see lions There were MANY constructions and some animals arent staying at where they are supposed to be Bat cages were empty   Its a lot of walking anyway Be ready to get tired   Theres AZoo tour on the website to travel comfortably riding on a cart for children or seniors Its not available at the ticket office I think they should fix that   Even though there are animals of many kinds there are still many this zoo doesnt have So dont expect to see every one you can imagine   Theres an arboretum in the zoo It was just okay level   There are a number of visitors in the zoo But this is a huge zoo and theres no chance to wait to see something We liked it   Some of them close at 1800 Youd better enter before that if you wish to see everything
10891,4,Most of our visit was in the Zoo Park many animals of all types we did not see what some may think as abuse Great walking self guided tour getting up the hill you ride a Ski Chairlift safety netting below we were 4 adults and all of us enjoyed the 3 hrs or so we were there quick lunch spots throughout A tip we did not have our Passports with us a discount would have been applied not sure of amount Not far from Downtown Seoul we would visit again in 2 years when we go back
10892,3,The park was one of my favourites but unfortunately it was under renovation during my last two visits April 2017 and April 2018 Not a great deal to see during renovation as many of the major attractions were closed Hope to see it again next year
10893,4,Seoul Grand Park is actually quite close to Gangnam a quick trip through the mountain just about 15 min from Seoul Arts Center It is a huge aerial that has hiking routes a lift a museum and a zoo So definitely a destination where one can spend a lot of time Once there it feels like it is hours from Seoul although it is very close completely different scenery and environment there quite relaxing The zoo is quite large and has a large variety of animals Grand Park is a great destination for a getaway
10894,4,Public transport to and from Seoul Grand Park is easy; several buses are available and there is a subway station that leads directly to the park entry  You can either walk take the lift or ride the miniature train to the zoo or the theme park  Entry prices are reasonable as are the lift and train prices
10895,3,Primarily came for the zoo Its a bit overwhelming in term of the size The place is so huge and be prepared to do a lot of walking  In term of animals a bit disappointed The only marine I saw was sea lion No more dolphin Didnt get to see many animals  The only nice thing I like is the sky lift If you visit must try sky lift
10896,5,Among all zoos I visited in my life I think this is the best Environment is clean and animals seen are all appear healthy and happy Many different animalsreptiles there and you would not be bored Only thing is do not go during Winter It is quite cold One more reminder  it is a nonsmoking park
10897,3,My kid loves animals so it was her 1st time in Seoul so I thought lets go and visit the Zoo The entrance to the zoo is very far so once you get off from the Metro you arrive at 1 entrance from there you can buy a ticket on the elephant train and then get off at the zoo entrance Once you get of the elephant train you have to pay again to get back on it lol  The actual zoo is very large but due to winter most of the animals are kept inside you can still see them but it would be better if you visit the Zoo after spring The paths are slippery with ice so be careful  Next to the zoo is Seoul Land an amusement park it was too cold to go there so didnt bother
10898,3,Good for long walk and if you have time  Also a nice place for picnic  Each area has separate entrance fees  Sky lift is a must to see the scenery from above  We did see much some animals are not there during our visit But we enjoyed walking due to cool breeze and autumn colors
10899,5,I love animals so Seoul Grand Park was great place for me Place was clean and there were many animals You can also cable car and see the beautiful view
10900,5,A larger area with a museum zoo and amusement park in it Separat entrances and fees Just a short subway ride out from Seoul and in a nice setting with mountain back drops
10901,5,I went to the zoo and it was great all kind of animals were there My advise to the people who wanna participate in activities like feeding the animals or playing with the dolphins to come after midday cause almost all the activities starts in the afternoon starting 230 pm and also later The attractions park is pretty big and the views are just beautiful you got the mountain and a huge forest it was perfect  Ps if you are planning to go to the zoo and to the attractions park it s better to free the full day cause just for the zoo it takes min 4 hours to see all kinds of animals And its better to wear some comfortable shoes cause you walk a looot
10902,3,Seouls Zoo the Grand Park is located by easy metro ride from the city Has lions tigers wolves bears and a good primate selection Unfortunately all the bird exhibits are currently closed for health reasons and the dolphins have been returned to the ocean so there are not any substantial marine life displays aside from seals Animals seem generally wellread for with some species benefiting from better habitats than others Some of the wolves seemed a little sad elephants seemed to have a very small space and seals appeared cramped too The zoo is in process of building some new enclosures and will hopefully improve those living conditions Minimal English signage but enough to find ones way around We visited on a Wednesday afternoon and the park was virtually empty which made for a very pleasant time Plenty of clean public restrooms and at least one convenience store in addition to numerous snack food vendors Food prices not marked up 09001900 5 entry 10 2part skylift oneway Take exit 2 from Grand Park metro walk toward main building then turn right at building and walk 300m to the Sky lift Recommend taking sky lift out to end of park and walking back to metro We didnt think there was enough to see to merit buying more skylift passes
10903,4,We went together with 2 other families and there are a total of 6 children aged 2 to 8 and 6 adults We only manage to go to the zoo though we bought the package price  Generally I am pleased to go there as my girl aged 8 is the only child who is interested in seeing those animals except that she is disappointed that she did not get to see dolphin there as the dolphins have gone back to nature  My younger daughter aged 6 did not enjoy seeing the animals as much as like the playground there  similar as the rest of the other kids  Good to allow the children to explore and see the real animals out there
10904,4,We visited this Park in the night after 7pm having taken around 50min subway ride from central Seoul The subway station nearest to the Park is named after the Grand Park itself  We were there primarily to see the cherry blossoms There were of course much fewer cherry blossom trees compared to Yeouido or Seokchon Lake nevertheless this Park is much more spacious and bigger and with fewer people as compared to the ever crowded Yeouido or Seokchon Lake  The cherry blossom trees are to the left of the entrance to the Park It was still a nice sight to behold even in the night due to the brightly lit night lights For the cherry blossom season especially there was some nice romantic decorations and also a row of 56 pianos freely available for visitors to play a nice melody to accompany the romantic ambience of the place Could see many couples and families with children being enthralled by the place taking wefies and photos  Overall a nice place to visit in the evenings after the main crowd visiting the zoo and other themedattractions have left
10905,5,One of the most picturesque autumn sceneries in Seoul We had a grand time in this huge park It was a very long walk from Exit 2 of Seoul Grand Park subway station to the parks ticket office But it was a pleasant walk as the weather was just a bit nippy We bought tickets for the elephant ride so as not to take a further hike to the park entrance At the same time we bought Sky Lift tickets one way for our ride back from the park to the main ticketing area I highly recommend riding the sky lift A fun and exciting way to see the park from above The park is very well maintained There is a bus that goes around the park with designated stops should you wish to ride while visiting different areas Take a map at the reception area to serve as your guide
10906,5,This park complex is accessible by train so easy to get to This massive area consists of a park gardens zoo amusement park and eateries as all as a large contemporary gallery There is also a chair lift system in two sections which is VERY long and has beautiful views as well as ground transport taking you from one attraction to the other or back to the train station Great for a half day out from the city or especially if you have kids you will need a whole day or more
10907,4,For all flower lovers Festival runs from May 27  12 June Beautiful varieties of roses in different hues and decorations Gorgeous for photographs enjoy the beautiful flora or just relax and gossippicnic in the shade like the locals Probably much less crowded during weekdays and some jostling with couples young girls and ajummas for the best shots Tis the season of love and as Robert Burns would say My love is like a red red rose Thats newly sprung in June My love is like the melody Thats sweetly played in tune Opens from 9 am to 7 pm Entrance fee KRW2000head Directions Subway Line 4 to Seoul Grand Park station exit 2 Walk straight till you reach the big fountain Continue to the right for 15 mins walk to the Rose Festival or you can take the KRW1000 elephant shuttle and disembark at the first stop
10908,4,If you have a day  in a good weather you may have fun with your children who loves to walk and explore animals  Its fun with young children Suggest to load your food and fruits and enjoy 
10909,5,The Grand Park is very big and for half a day I could not finish seeing just its zoo The zoo requires a separate ticket and has a separate entrance far from the main park building The zoo entrance is a good 1520 minutes walk from the main entrance and it is better to go firstly into the main entrance building and to buy a ticket 1000 KRW for the elephant train to take you to the zoo entrance The zoo has various animals birds and insects There is also an elevated bushland at the rear but there is nothing much to see in there except some occasional fungi mushrooms I like the bird aviary where one can find red crowned cranes; the aviary is quite large On the weekend there are numerous children and the atmosphere is great I would think that it takes more than one day to see the whole grand park
10910,4,Had a great day at Seoul Zoo last week with two couples and three children We love the ski lift that slowly takes you to the top of the zoo and lets you walk downhill all day I thought the leopard  lion tiger and bear exhibits were great and now that the temperatures are dropping they were much more active Everyone loved the dolphin show which was the perfect length and featured both dolphins and sea lions doing neat tricks in an indoor amphitheater We also enjoyed a nice picnic at one of the many picnic tables throughout the park This zoo could use a little modernization and some of the exhibits were a bit tired but it remains an overall great experience Oh yeah they have a baby elephant
10911,5,I had an Amazing time there Ive been there twice and thats because of how beautiful it is And specially when you are an animal lover Its perfect for couples friends families I recommend going there when weather is nice Not too cold not too hot The view up there was absolutely breathtaking It was like painting                                                      
10912,5,We visited with a 3 year old and a 7 year old and we had a lot of fun There is quite a bit of walking but there are trams and gondolas to ride Quite a bit of animals to see and even a small amusement park area We had great weather in Oct Worth a visit if you have an entire day to spend
10913,5,Great outdoor time with family and kids of all ages There is a nice zoo a fun amusement park and a museum Easily reachable on subway line 4 A much better experience than Lotte World as far as the amusement park is concerned Sometimes they have discounts for foreigners
10914,4,Huge place Very nice view of mountains behind it The Zoo is pretty big and they have a lot of animals but the facilities needs to be improved I dont mind going back tho must see place if youre an animal lover
10915,5,If youre ever in country and you want to experience the Big City Park you must definitely visit Seoul Grand Park it has so much to offer from Sightseeing Attractions Ridesfor children too Archery Ski Lift Zoo and so many restaurants and snack bars its the perfect place to go for fun with the family or with your friends
10916,2,We went there in August and its too hot for us We could only walked for half an hour and decided to leave The zoo is pretty old The staff is not good at providing information as we walk along the way to the zoo from cable car station we just realized that there a shuttle bus to the zoo but the woman at the information didnt tell us So we have to walk under really hot weather
10917,4,The zoo is vast Lot of animals The chimps entertain Take the skylift sit and relax Best thing is the dolphin and seal show Ask for timings of the show at ticket counter Sit near the front if you want to get wet You can use the subway to reach there
10918,4,The zoo is a part of Seoul Grand Park outside Seoul Grand Park station line 4On weekends take the subwayits not worth all the traffic driving thereAs you exit the station there is a long walk to the grand park main entrance There will be some imo offputting smells mostly form the boiling bundegi silkworm pupae Theres even a KFC and a convenience storerecommend you get some water as the zoo is big You can get water and ddrinks inside as well At the entrance of the park you can walk further to the zoo but that isnt recommended Go to the booth and pay 1000won for a ride on the elephant tram The tram hits all the sites at the park and drops you off infront of the zoo You can also ride the skylift for about 5000won The zoo is big Frankly too big What I mean is there are many of the different animal pavilions are separated by long stretches of trees and grass So youre walking uphill a lot and seeing nothing for that time Its nice if thats what you want to see but it seemed like a lot of wasted space Somemany of the animal pens were rather small The monkey and ape sections were tiny The park is relatively clean and there are plenty of food stall along the different paths Unfortunately they all sell the same things like sausage corndogs and fishcakeson a stick And coffee Bad tasting coffee The meats on sticks were pretty bad Dont use the bathrooms here Use at the subway or if you have the time go to the museum across the roadwonderfully clean there You can take the skylift from the rear of the zoo and save yourself the walk Its fun and you get a really wonderful view Expect long lines when people are starting to leave FYI be aware of your clothes on the skylift Adjust miniskirts when you sit If this is your first trip to Korea youll see people all over the place camped out on blankets and mats Theyre not homeless Dont give them change The zoo is a very nice park to spend the day with friends or family wear comfortable shoes Bring snacks and water Bring wet tissues
10919,4,though it is publish that the zoo is 10th largest in the world there are some places that is a bit poorly maintained and no more animal display i dont know if it is just for the start of spring this is still inside the metro but a but far from where we stay in Myeongdong though it is still connected to the Subway
10920,5,Very nice and big zoo we were there for 5 hours and did not get to see everything Even though it was quite busy on a Sunday the park is big enough to not feel trapped in the masses Some very nice pavilions especially the tiger part but also unfortunately some very small cages for certain animals End of March is still a bit cold and some animals were thus still kept inside which is good for them no complaints on that as an animal lover and the grass and flowers still have to set in I certainly recommend the place its a must visit but would advice to go mid April or later Also very cheap 3000 WON for an adult
10921,4,You got to be well rested before you visit this place wear comfortable shoes and pack some drinks and snack for it will take you the whole day to see this place The seoul grand park is 3 parks in one You have the Zoo Seoul land theme park and Science museum So all ages is covered there is something for everyone Different admission fees For the zoo it is around W3000 a bargain if you ask me There is so much to see just be prepared to walk since its a big zoo Bigger than the one in Singapore Although the design is an openfenceless zoo since it was winter some of the animals were in their enclosures You got to plan which animals you would like to see since there are trails color coordinated painted on the floor For the Seoul land theme park I just took a look Looks good from where i was standing It is also big with rides for both adult and kids Across the grand park is a new building which is the science museum It closes around 5 pm so if you like to see this place make it a priority before the other 2 Its a nice museum for kids
10922,5,We took the chair lift into the zoo top end to save on up slope walking After getting off the chair lift most of the animals can be seen up close thanks to the glass enclosures Most animals can be seen fairly active and not hidden sleeping in their holes Toilets are plenty in the whole zoo and kept clean As it is not peak season the kiosk selling snack food are close which is alright as there are still indoor eating house to be found I would high recommend this zoo for the opportunity to see the animals up close safely
10923,4,I went to Seoul Grand Park in early November and its a right time to visit the park if you wanna see the beautiful leafs change color into red or yellow Its a big and beautiful park in Seoul
10924,4,It is a nice place to see the nature inside the downtown of Seoul Even we move around only at the Zoo it took one day When we arrived at the park buy tickets to take the elephant shaped bus cable car and entrace fees Can see different kinds of lovely animals at there The only thing is the taste of the food are not delicious at the restaurants and are expensive comparing with the taste Street food of fried potatos and BBQ are okay Also you can enjoy one cup beer with 2500 Won After one day trip in the zoo we felt so tired of walking Anyhow it is such a good place especially if you love animals
10925,5,Even though its located in the mountain its close to the city and its a very nice place to spend a day Recommended seasons are summer and autumn and in order to take advantage of the resources you better take the cable car from the very beggining and go to the top of the park and then you start from the top to the bottom otherwise you will have to take a walk up to the mountain and in consequence be more tired
10926,4,it is just zoo can you take a train and it so nomal if you vist spring or fall its good but winter and summer is bed
10927,5,Recently I conducted a photo workshop focused on photographing wild animals Rather than trying to stalk and photograph the critters we ramped up our odds of finding subjecs by heading off to the Seoul Zoo Yeah a zoo  a place that I had thought to be a rather lame place to take photos  Well I was wrong in so many ways First the Seoul Zoo is no longer that third class park with dingy animal exhibits and less than optimally cared for animals The place is simply amazing Its huge clean beautiful and a real joy to be during a fine spring day The exhibits include many walkins including a massive enclosure of cranes storks and other waterfowl where the public can see birds wading swimming and flying without any barriers other than a hand rail There are other walkins for tropical birds where the birds literally flutter around you And the tiger exhibit is really exceptional  but naturally not a walkin exhibit  Second its a great place to take photographs Sometimes its almost as easy as shooting fish in a barrel; but other times such as trying to catch cranes in mid flight one can appreciate what goes into quality wildlife photography in the field Also there were many young couples courting there with their ubiquitous selfiesticks Naturally the place had more than its fair share of kids but because the place is truly spacious they were not underfoot as they could have easily been in a smaller park  Its been decades since Ive had such a good time at a zoo The last time was the San Diego Zoo The Seoul Zoo is not yet on the same level as the San Diego Zoo but it is coming up close to that level For W3000 admission the Seoul Zoo has to be one of the hidden gems of Korea  Seoul Zoo at Seoul Grand Park is located in Gyeonggido just south of Seoul The Seoul Zoo is 15 km walk or tram ride from the subway station There is also a 1 Km lift available about 05 km from exit 2 of the subway  Opening Hours 0900 am  1900 pm depending on season some walkin exhibits close at 5 pm  Admission Adult 19 3000 won Youth 13  18 2000 won Child 6  12 1000 won Under 6 is free Botanical Gardens and Dolphin show cost extra  How to get to Seoul Zoo Take line 4 to Seoul Grand Park station and leave exit 2 Follow the map View a map at httpwwwexploringkoreacomseoulzooseoulgrandpark
10928,3,I visited the Gwacheonlocated Seoul Grand Park and it was overall a positive experience I only visited the zoo section and not Seoul Land the amusement park For what its worth my friends have told me that Seoul Land isnt really worth it compared to Lotte World or Everland The zoo features many animals of all kinds and species and from all continents Theres pretty much everything you can think of  reptiles big mammals seals elephants lions The park is also perfectly located in between mountains and offers a stunning view It also has a fairly large choice of dining and snack options My bigger complaint with the park is that it feels a bit run down Enclosures are fairly stale and a some animals seemed a bit unhealthy It also lacks some kind of a theme safari themes for different clades or cintinents special events allowing greater interaction with animals or staff as well as a session dedicated to children for example
10929,5,Its is most amazing and entertaining place in Seoul The place is full of exciting rides and even the most adventurous place its lush green landscaping is one of the most unique
10930,4,if u dont have your own car u need to walk a lot from the near station  seoul grand park has some attractions inside amusement park rose park animal park and then u can use a bus to move there in reasonable ticket
10931,5,A great place to spend the day away from the City We went early in the morning and had the zoo almost to ourselves for the first hour before the school groups arrived Not that they were a problem quite the opposite It was nice to see how well behaved and attentive they were as the learned about the different animals The skyway was fun and saved us a walk and the plants and flowers both in the zoo and the park were beautiful
10932,4,I love it We went to the zoo ride the sky lift and watched the animals Botanical park are so lovely The zoo itself is really pretty
10933,4,This is a lovely green park south of Seoul While most people come here to visit the zoo or the theme park the park itself can be enjoyed for a long 12 hours of a peaceful stroll The park is easily accessed by a nearby Metro Seoul Grand Park station on line 4 but be prepared to walk some distances as the park is huge
10934,4,Ive read a couple other reviews here and I share generally the same sentiment The zoo itself is incredible there are tons of animals from all over the world to see The rose gardens are amazing as well I took a gondola ride that goes over everything and provides you with amazing views I am however slightly concerned for the animals You can literally put your hands about 3 feet from the cages and feed the animals food I saw people giving the Gibbons cheetos It was sort of funny but I felt guilty watching it Different country different views on how a zoo should be run but overall I had a great time
10935,4,I am big fan of ZOOs in general and I was looking forward to see this ZOO You have direct subway line to get there ZOO was really cheap like 3USD to enter for whole day A lot of animals to look at I loved it  But there is one point to mention I do have worries about taking care of the animals there You can see that animals are not in the best shape and not happy as well Especially the cage for jaguars is very small So this fact was a dark side of my visit   But ZOO is in the beautiful environment so you really feel escaped from the city
10936,5,My honey and I spent a lovely day at the zoo in May This place is huge so comfortable shoes is a must The lions and snake pit were by far my favorite However I will say the food selection wasnt so great; just my opinion Make sure to purchase the three part package deal
10937,4,We went to the zoo as well as Rose Garden The Zoo is huge and we spent more than half a day there taking our time to explore the whole park Rose Garden is beautiful and there was a performance going on when we were there
10938,4,We went to Seoul Grand Park to go to the zoo We had not realised just how gigantic this place is There is a LOT to do there and we really could have spent more than a day and done more things  The zoo is good generally although some of the exhibits were a little disappointing I was a bit concerned about the welfare of some of the animals But they are doing some things up so hopefully that will improve  The surrounding area is fabulous Lots of gorgeous views of the forest Apparently there are lots of hiking trails too  There is also a cable car option which we might do next time to get a better view
10939,5,Came here specially to see cherry blossoms and not going to the zoo Love the entire park as the cherry trees were in full bloom and the crowd was not as much as Yeuido Park
10940,4,Childrens park zoo childrens museum and more and most stuff is free Wear good walking shoes and keep yourself warm Went in jan and March and will go back again
10941,3,went there in january really cold buts was a nice experience anyway I was well prepared for the cold and would not recommend going there in winter
10942,4,Nice BIG park but avoid going in winter There isamusement park but super expensive Also an Art Museum but close on Mondays The Science park is opp this place so u can plan to visit both on same day
10943,2,the weather was v cold yesterday and there were hardly any visitors the area was huge and its difficult to tour the place with young kids due to the unbearable cold  if you must visit then heres what I would recommend exit from the subway and walk straight ahead for 510mins there is a building right in front buy you tram ticks here do not attempt to walk to the zoo with young children its a very long walk 15mins at least  the tram goes to seoul zoo and seoul land alight at the zoo and proceed to buy zoo ticks and sky lift ticks they are sold at different counters  take the sky lift right to the top of the zoo and make a leisurely walk downhill the sky lift is about 10mins gives you a great elevated view of the entire area worth the money in my opinion
10944,4,I visited this place in october 2013  the weather was really good for traveling around this place All animals seem to be still fall asleep as we came around 10am This place is not smelly and well kept and the track from one place to another is easy they even provide free shuttle bus every 15mins We watched Dolphin show for free and somehow its interesting   Dont miss the Kangaroo feeding experience where we can try to feed them and also the Bird paradise awesome To visit  use subway Line 4 Seoul Grand Park Station Exit 2  Admission is 3000Won and Skylift is 9000Won from entrance to Zoo nearby lion and tiger exhibition I recommend to use the skylift since the view of the zoo from upside is nice
10945,3,You can finish the zoo by walking No tigers during my visit and the aquarium was closed Lovely Giraffes though
10946,5,This is a really nice zoo that is clean and beautifully laid out It is also inexpensive Be prepared to walk a lot but there are so many creatures to see Our favourite was the nursery where we saw a baby orangutan chimpanzee Meer cat and 3 baby tigers
10947,5,We are a family of four we have a 9 year old daughter and a 3 year old son We went to Seoul Grand Park on Sep 1 2013 and loved it I would highly recommend taking the subway line 4 stop SEOUL GRAND PARK If you exit out of exit 2 you will walk about 14 mile to the SGP tram loadingunloading zone I would recommend paying to ride the tram as the entrance to the zoo is about 12 to 34 of a mile uphill and trust me you are going to be walking uphill enough The tram cost us 2700 won Although the tram area looks busy as all get out trams came one right after another only waiting about 30 seconds between trams They moved us out like cattle We were pleased with the tram So once the tram stopped we bought our tickets to the zoo they included a special theme ticket allowing us into another attraction I am all but certain it was the rose garden but we never made it and we entered the zoo 9600 won total I could NOT believe how inexpensive it was Ok once in the zoo either take the ski lift all the way up to the top and walk down and call it a day or find a good spot to tighten your walking shoes The walk to the top is uphill you will earn your view of the lions and the other cats but it is well worth it Ive never been to a zoo that had over 6 lions not lioness lions This zoo has it ALL from Bison Bears so many Dolphins to Deer The highlight of the day was the deer eating out of my daughter and sons hand although its probably not recommended by the staff if you have little ones than bring lettuce or carrots my kids just fed them the green leaves they found on the ground and they ate them We had absolutely no complaints about this zoo in fact it blew away our expectations Bathrooms extremely clean convenient stores selling soda and snacks for regular prices not jacked up because its in a zoo a soda was 900 won and such a wide variety of animals Tip 1  allow a FULL day here So the end of the day we hopped back on the tram and we thought it would take us straight to the loadingunloading area we boarded the tram when we arrivedno It made one stop at Seoul Land prior to heading back Tip 2  there is MORE at the Seoul Grand Park than the zoo Who knew right Well we do and we are definitely heading back soon We had an incredible day
10948,4,Before I review the zoo at Seoul Grand Park I must state it is always my preference to view wildlife in their natural habitat It is a much more thrilling and worthwhile experience  As far as zoos go Seoul Grand Park offers a variety of animals with accurate information on the different species All zoo exhibits are far too small for wild animals But we should make it clear in modernday zoos most animals are now bread in captivity or incapable of returning to the wild for a multitude of reasons Zoos today are primarily for education not exhibiting ferocious exotic or bizarre animals just for the wow factor Zoo management can always work to improve the conditions and how animals are shown to the public I am therefore judging Seouls premier zoo in comparison to others around the world The zoo is comparable to many in the US but certainly a peg below the San Diego Zoo in both diversity in species and exhibit quality Seoul Grand Park is far better than any zoo in China that Ive seen even with the exclusion of the much loved panda The exhibits are cleaner more spacious and the signboards provide far more information than other zoos Ive visited in Asia and some in the US  I enjoyed my time here the exhibits were often interesting But like most zoos there were individual exhibits that just needed to be larger and better kept This is by no means unique to Seoul Grand Park even in the San Diego Zoo there are old exhibits that need renovationexpansion
10949,5,The zoo was easily accessible from the subway station and the website provided the stops and exit information which was very helpful for foreigners We were pleasantly surprised by the view and location of the zoo It was enclosed in a beautiful mountain area The admission fee was extremely reasonable but visitors will need to plan on spending an entire day there to be able to experience the whole park We were there for almost five hours and were only able to see a little over half of the park The animal exhibits were unbelievable We saw so many different species of animals It was a little rainy on the day that we went so some of the events were cancelled The monkeys had all had babies recently so it was so neat to watch the mothers interact with their children This is a family friendly place and a must see attraction when visiting Seoul
10950,4,Seoul Grandpark is easily accessible via subway M4  It is a grand park and suits the natural lovers the most THere is no entrance fee for the park yet seoul government taken good care of it  Recommendation   a Go via subway m4 b Visit in the morning the air was fresh c Suitable for all family members d Take the trains to go around the park as the park is so huge and will be a burden to elderly e Visit the zoo entrance fee was 3000 won with many animals so worthwhile f Highlight of the Zoo  silverback gorilla dolphin show at 1130am g U may spend 34 hours easily there
10951,5,Ive visited this awesome place around october 2012 with husband and a daugther Since we are from Malaysia this is my first time visited seoul with this fantastic view in autumn season Coming here not because of their animals but wanted to see and feel how colorful autumn trees look alike with our own eyes One thing that my daughter like is sitting on the chairlift while we enjoy the very beautiful sceneries from above ts a worth visit this place only in an autumn season for people like us
10952,5,For the short time that we had in Seoul and the fact that we only relied on the subway to get to Seoul Grand Park we were pleasantly surprised at the variety of birds to be seen there The park is easly accessible by Seoul Metro had KFC on the grounds and is clean and safe Late March is really not a good time to see lots of birds but still we still saw at least thirteen new bird species in a space of four hours
10953,4,Snow boarding and the rollercoasters also i find the shooting range very interesting one good point is the beauty of the scenery
10954,4,Guess choosing to go in winter was both a good and bad idea  The brutal cold was not forgiving but the view was worth every shiver and frostbite I suffered The zoo being surrounded by mountains which made the view amazingly beautiful and the streams within made the view even prettier There was buses to bring visitors around the zoo which was fairly big but it is definitely a good workout  The zoo was not catered for visiting in the winter as most of the enclosures were closed and animals being put indoors where it was heated The conditions of the indoor enclosures was pretty bad and the smell was pungent and took getting used to  What I loved most though was the baby animals section where we got to see various animals up close just separated by a glass panel Seeing the baby leopard up close was amazing   Would return again to have a look at the animals in their natural enclosure if I ever go again in spring or autumn Mainly because of the affordable admission and the wide variety of animals we can see But this time I would take the free shuttle and not walk the whole area P
10955,1,The conditions these animals have to live in is awful The zoo owners clearly care more about attracting visitors than they do about their animalstheir winter habitats were concrete jail cells and most animals looked visibly unhappyunderfed The habitats set up for the warmer months didnt look any better really and pretty much just looked like cages instead of places to make the animal feel at home I was so sad by the time I left and couldnt even bring myself to see the whole zoo Please dont support them and rather go to a zoo that takes care of their animals properly
10956,5,My family went there during early winter just after the first major snow fall for the year Seoul zoo is nested in the Seoul Grand Park cluster easily accessible via subway The place was quiet peaceful and fabulous The team tried their best to make the visit enjoyable by pointing us in the right directions as the animals from the warmer are kept in inhouse shelters Not a zoo expert but the big cats dogs birds of prey and deers appear wellfed energetic and expressive  There are plenty of snow for snow fights as well  In my view it truly deserve to be recommended for a visit especially for kids Pricewise the ticket price of KRW7000 per adult is very reasonable given the long and scenic cable ride from the entrance the shuttle to the zoo entrance and the energetic animals
10957,4,A lovely place with lots of interesting nooks and crannies I was certainly glad of the ski lift taking us back down when we left though I was too tired to walk all the way back down after a day of exploring
10958,2,I love animals and I love zoos  when animals are treated right This zoo was not one of those places The animals were thin some with fur missing Animals paced back and forth The cages were small concrete slabs not habitats One cage no bigger than my bachelorstudio apartment had 3 cheetahs in it Even the grounds themselves were drab I do not recommend going to this zoo  there are plenty of better ones that treat animals kindly and with respect
10959,4,Grand Park is located near subway station 437 It is better to buy pass for two cable ways 9000 W per adult  oneway After first one you need to buy entry pass to Zoo Second cable way is longer Then it is pleasant to go through Zoo down There are lot of different animals and birds Some of them are especially pretty
10960,3,There were a lot of animals here but I didnt feel that their enclosures were up to international standards Many seemed very small and sparse  some looking just like jail cells
10961,5,Seoul Zoo is a great place with or without kids There are many different animals to see in a huge park It is very well maintained with lots of interactive displays Including many places to eat  drink
10962,4,This was a great experience taking the kids out for a day of fun The roller coaster rides for kids are awesome and they will feel like they experienced a real thrill but that it was not scary One of their favorite rides was the water roller coaster
10963,5,The two places I have enjoyed visiting at Seoul Grand park are Seoulland Amusement Park and Seoul Zoo My day at Seoul Zoo was especially enjoyable it is a nice area to walk around there are two different sky lifts one in the lower area and another at the top part of the Zoo which is on a fair slope We enjoyed the sky lift so much with its fantastic views that we took both skylifts up to the top of the hill walked around the various attractions and took the lower sky lift back down again as we thought it was neat The other thing we liked the most was the dolphin and seal show It was the best I have ever seen and I recommend everyone to go to it but the queue to get in is always very long so buy your ticket for a later show go and look at some of the animals then come back at least 30 minutes before show time and get in the front of the queue if you want a front row seat
10964,5,Here you can find Seoul Land an amusement park a science museum for kids a zoo a contemporary art museum race track and more There is a tram you can ride as it is quite far to walk from place to place
10965,4, It is a street where the old and the new are in exquisite harmony and it is a place welcomed by foreigners and locals 
10966,5, There are people in each store who can speak several languages so I thought it was Insadong 
10967,5, I went to eat Taegeukdang shaved ice and got rejected so I went to the shaved ice shop on the second floor near 50m 
10968,5, Its perfect for making stamps and buying gifts for foreigners such as bells and fans 
10969,4,Too hot
10970,3, Because it is a weekday there are not many visitors there are many empty stores 
10971,1, The smell of people Street shops are interesting Prices are cheap I wonder if its because a lot of foreigners come 
10972,5, mashita The atmosphere is nice but there are a lot of foreigners and not many people in the morning 
10973,4,Evolving into an art district Traditional tea cafes are an added attraction for tired feet
10974,5,The MOXY hotel is a great place to stay in Seoul  Insadong has so much to do and see and most importantly to eat The street vendors have amazing food  Most even have someone that can understand a little English  At least to order 
10975,4,Wasnt as great as previous reviews I have read but I imagine that was prior to covid Seems to be buzzing a bit but expected more
10976,5,A good place to grab souvenirs and anything you might have forgotten
10977,5, Place I stopped by while walking around Nakwon Shopping Mall All the clerks were friendly and the tea was good Take a good rest in a large 
10978,3,cute older area with artsy souvenirs shops and tea shopscafes
10979,3,In many cases an overpriced area Tea and other locally produced items cannot be found easily
10980,4,Place for tourists desperate for gifts
10981,5,One of the best places for souvenirs
10982,5,Lovely atmospheric street full of touristsfriendly shops and restaurants
10983,4,Great place to shop and eat though it is very pricey compared to regular open markets due to tourism
10984,4,Lots of shops some with truly special art most with more of the same  Good food choices
10985,5, I think its a wellpreserved and worthwhile street in Seoul There are many restaurants and places to see especially in the alleys and narrow streets connected to the main road It is said that there was a lot of 
10986,5, Ive been to Insadong several times but its oldfashioned and there are a lot of people coming and going and there are restaurants and shops around that seem to bring people together 
10987,3, It is one of the representative tourist attractions in Seoul Prices and food are expensive 
10988,4, its okay Service needs a lot of improvement 
10989,5,Many interesting things great if you like to take pictures of out of the ordinary things and crafts
10990,5, Its been a while since I went to New Years Eve and went to Insadong but again there were a lot of people and there were a lot of things to see and it was good I bought a bracelet from this place 
10991,5, There are many companies nearby so if you go during lunch time you may have to wait a long time 
10992,4,Not bad
10993,5, Insadong street after riding Namsan Tower Gyeongin Museum of Art Healing Artworks by Kim Kyungi Windsurfing at Ttukseom Park 
10994,5, Morning walk 900 Afternoon walk 1600 A street with traditional culture in the city center Its one of my favorite streets in Seoul where I often come to relax 
10995,3, Koreas representative street comma in the city 
10996,4, Also Insadong Its been a long time since I went so it was good to become a memory 
10997,5,Its beautiful
10998,5,Very famous area with palace Museum and Market to shop Drop by shops and have your pictures drawn for Souvenir
10999,4, I came here to see two first exhibitions and two still lifes of Mr Ga Gookhyeon The road from Jongno 3ga was bleak I also bought a teapot and a plate 
11000,3, Many shops are closed due to the corona virus so the old Insadong street feel is gone And there are a lot of buildings that hurt the oldfashioned look of Insadong 
11001,5, cultural attractions There are many pubs at night and you can get rid of the fatigue of the day place to have a drink 
11002,5, Ive been to this place many times before and its still good Ssamziegil has more places to experience than before And the dumplings are delicious 
11003,5, It is said that the number of tourists has decreased compared to the past due to the corona outbreak that has occurred since February 2020 but in the current Corona situation this place is not Corona 
11004,4, things used in the past Seeing it again and feeling it worth going at least once 
11005,4, Prices are not too expensive Gotta be selective A nice place 
11006,5, I went to the streets of Insadong after a long time remembering the old chutt but a lot of the old fashions have disappeared and a lot has changed Hope the corona goes away soon 
11007,5, The entrance from the Jongno 2ga side was too shabby so it was sad that Insadong street was ruined When I went deep inside I almost had a preconceived notion 
11008,5, Gallery Picture Exhibition Young artist exhibition nice to watch 
11009,4, I used to go there often with my wife and children but it seems that there are less people than before because of Corona However the restaurants still have a long wait 
11010,4, Street STREET AVENUE 
11011,5, Ive been to Insadong for a long time It has become so clean and colorful It was a pity that the classic feeling of the past disappeared a bit but it was a fun time because there were workshops and restaurants that 
11012,3, A place with a regret that it would become a worldclass tourist attraction if the streetscape was changed a little more 
11013,5, Street of memories There arent many people Its not uncommon to bump into each other in the past 
11014,4, Insadong still has a lot to see Its fun to explore alley alley restaurants 
11015,2, the street is too narrow Im not alive It was very depressing 
11016,5, As usual the streets crowded with lovers and overseas tourists on weekends feel a bit quiet due to the corona virus 
11017,4, It was a pity that I couldnt feel the lively vitality as before 
11018,1,No Good
11019,5,There is so much flavor on this street even during the Covid down time For a photographer like me its paradise 
11020,4,It takes time to find the really nice things
11021,4, There is a fashionable cafe there is a traditional dining room and there are various ways to enjoy it 
11022,5,Take time to explore the little alleys along the main path There are some hidden gems to be found little secret cafes and a Michelin Star Noodle House
11023,5, There is much to see There is a paid parking lot 
11024,4, A street that always feels good But I dont feel comfortable seeing a lot of empty stores 
11025,5, Its a fastpaced street between Shuns entrance theres a lot to see and its fun There is no need to search for a restaurant to find it 
11026,5, In the past there were a lot of old things so the image of the three letters of Insadong was quite old but only the name remained and the characteristics of the stores disappeared 
11027,5,    
11028,5, There are lots of fun things to eat and there are many galleries in street musicians so there are various places to see 
11029,5, No matter how you take a photo it becomes a photo of your life I like to go at sunset and in the evening 
11030,3, Insadong is a place where memories remain The 70yearold road especially the narrow alleyways are beautiful 
11031,3, Various exhibitions Lots to see 
11032,5, Its been a while since Ive been to Insadong but there are so many things to see and eat so its good to go on a date 
11033,4, What do you need to say InsadongBut there are so many people visiting this placeThere are so many things to see and eat 
11034,5, Its not as good as it used to be but I think its reenergizing 
11035,5, The oldfashioned street adds to its charm rather than the bustle of the city 
11036,5,Dont miss to buy typical souvenirs Cozy and genuine
11037,5,I love this place because have everything for tour Right now no people much and have many shop is close because of covid 19 And have Line Frds shop open new
11038,5, I like it when Im bored shopping and looking around Have a drink 
11039,4, He is slowly getting out of his sluggish appearance but it seems that it will take time to recover his former appearance It is a very good street for walking as it is less noisy from Chinese people 
11040,5, Insadong is always a friendly place It reminds me of the old days of Insadong on a rainy day 
11041,3, Insadong is good but the price of Insadong itself is a bit expensive 
11042,3, Foreign tourists have decreased due to Corona but now many citizens come and go 
11043,5, Seouls representative traditional street during the Corona Pandemic Era but still crowded with people For street snacks we recommend corn hotteok tteokbokki dalgona traditional 
11044,5, It was good because there were no people and it was quiet because of Corona 
11045,4, Many shops are closed due to the corona virus There are also new shopping malls but hurry up I hope that individual entrepreneurs who have been struggling with the corona 
11046,5,Variety of stores ranging from  to 
11047,5, newly transformed place Its nice to hang out with old people and young people when you come here 
11048,3, Today is Sunday Shortsleeved clothes were a little chilly because there werent many people in the fall so everyone is in the mood to be careful about Corona 
11049,5, I stopped by after going to Jogyesa Temple but even though it was 12 oclock the store was late so I couldnt see it 
11050,5, Its my own place that I mostly go to at night What if people suddenly increase at night after seeing this 
11051,5,Very similar to Myeongdong and other famous streets in Korea but make it traditional There are a lot of tea houses and souvenir shops They also sell dalgona candy here the OG dalgona and a bunch of other food 
11052,5, A place I recently found Its been a while so its awkward 
11053,4, Its Corona time A bit quiet but clean Nice place with a neat street 
11054,4,Great place to see local talent of crafts and grab a cup of tea and bite to eat
11055,4, Lots to see and see But things are expensive Other than that its fun 
11056,4, It was a bit disappointing as there were many shops that were closed due to the corona virus but there are also many newly reorganized buildings 
11057,4, There are a lot of interesting things but I feel that the price is a bit high 
11058,5, Overall there is a harmony between the old buildings and the present city and there is a bright atmosphere There are dark parts but overall it is similar to Hongdae but it feels like it is growing into a new hot 
11059,4, Visiting art museums Buy flowers A pretty hat maker A cup of coffee was very good 
11060,4, Due to Corona the streets are too quiet I hope the corona will calm down as soon as possible and the streets will be full of people and lively 
11061,5, Sell something traditional Also the road is nice and unknown singers or dancers sometimes perform 
11062,4, Its a traditional culture street in Insadong so its a good place to spend a day with your family if you wander around the alleys to see taste and buy 
11063,4, As interest in art has increased again these days galleries have many works worth seeing and more people It has good accessibility to nearby Bukchon Village and Ikseondong making it a 
11064,5, The place is very wonderful a traditional area where you can see shops that sell sweet things and gifts for gifts because they are related to Korea and there is a sweet market 
11065,5, where no words are needed Although a lot of the old taste has disappeared there are art galleries and museums in every alley and if you enter the shop thinking it is just a store 
11066,1, too many scammers Park Ahjis pit is Insadong 
11067,5, Due to Corona there is nothing to see Sometimes its good to look around 
11068,5,Perfect place to spend an afternoon
11069,5, Insadong is an old street with traditional tea houses etc Its more fun on weekends

11106,4, The streets were more busy than usual and I even felt a little sloppy but the rich sights and restaurants still greeted people 
11107,2, Its so quiet because of the corona There isnt much to see and I just looked around and I hope that the corona of that guy will end 
11108,3, It would be nice if there were some things to do or something to see 
11109,3,so so nothing special
11110,5, Insadong  It was a place with the most people coming and going After the corona crisis all commercial districts collapsed 
11111,5, A place where you can always feel comfortable and breathe 
11112,5, There are many places to go and a lot to see There are many clean department stores so there is no problem with the bathroom 
11113,4, This is Insadong Street looking back at the feeling of traveling abroad It is a place that many foreigners visit 
11114,5, I visited because there was an exhibition by my favorite artist It was great to be able to focus on the work in a quiet atmosphere 
11115,5,Nice place to visit
11116,5, Because of corona there are many empty shops I dream of old Insadong street Fighting selfemployed people 
11117,4, Because it is a coronavirus state how about a person There was Whether the restaurants were all ruined or not

11122,5, I went to the folk painting exhibition It was so good that the quarantine was thorough and the folk paintings were diverse 
11123,5,A beautiful street with many beauty shops
11124,5, Small india Old indian restaurant Even when Insadonggil was overflowing with people even in this difficult 
11125,5, I like Insadong my hometown where I always feel Its a shame because the shops close early because of the corona The economy should recover quickly Ulleungdo the street is delicious It doesnt stick to your 
11126,5, The atmosphere of the streets of Insadong is overly fun and has a good feeling 
11127,3, If your taste is right there are many things to see but if not there is so much 
11128,4, Its a cold day so there arent many people on the street 
11129,2,There is nothing to see or eat now Featureless
11130,4, Insadong in midwinter It was busy because of the corona 
11131,3, The streets are too busy due to Corona 19 People seem to be the only store owners 
11132,3, Its too busy and there are no people in each store Its so quiet that I didnt know even if a customer came in 
11133,4, There are few people with corona Many shops are also closed 
11134,2, There are several rental locations on the first floor of the Insadong building 
11135,4, Wellmaintained Insadong Street After all its sloppy because of the corona Wearing a mask and looking around 
11136,2, Its Saturday morning so its cool and there are no people I think I went to Insadong after 10 years but my old traces are disappearing 
11137,5,Great
11138,5, Things to see and buy Are you the street you want to walk 
11139,3, Its a holiday but the streets are busy because of Corona 19 You can hardly see street vendors 
11140,5, Insadong Street which was always crowded on weekends was busy due to the corona crisis but personally it was nice to be able to travel leisurely 
11141,4, Its nice not to be crowded because of the corona but it looks too busy 
11142,3,Nice
11143,5,Good
11144,3, Insadong after a long time The shops at the entrance havent changed much and there arent many tourists Although it is a traditional street the products we made are gradually being pushed out and there are many 
11145,4, A street where you can see the beauty of Korea The downside is that the food fee is a bit expensive 
11146,2, The streets and shops are quiet maybe because of the corona 
11147,5, The streets that became idle due to corona Sometimes I walk and drink and remember 
11148,3, I want the surroundings to be cleaner Compared to being famous as a travel destination the management seems to be a bit lowkey 
11149,5, Its been a while since I had a job but there are many things to see and there are quite a few people than I thought so I felt like I went downtown 
11150,5,Really loved the shops Jewelry  ceramics art supplies
11151,3, Its just normal Kkakdugi was delicious 
11152,4,Its been a while but the streets seem to be neat
11153,5, Because of the corona a person who goes a few months ago I write it down82 While longing for the past 
11154,5, Good for a date Lots of things to eat and see 
11155,5, Nowadays it is less complicated and the acquaintances of the artists who exhibit in the gallery seem to fill the streets for exhibition visits so it feels like a true art street in Insadong 
11156,5,You can enjoy both traditional and modern street culture of Seoul
11157,4, After leaving Insadong in 30 years I really dont know where Im going 
11158,5, It is a traditional artistic and cultural space so I want to visit occasionally 
11159,5, When you go here there are exhibitions almost 365 days a year so you can see and enjoy cultural and artistic works and there are many things to see and eat 
11160,4, The food was delicious The working people seem to be working well systematically 
11161,4,Awesome ambience
11162,4, It is busy because it is a coronavirus situation Rather thats why its better 
11163,5, Insadong street after half a year from corona Unlike usual I went into a small alleyway avoiding the Insadong Cafe Street and the old shops bursting with cute ambience make me feel like an old lady 
11164,3, I go to the Song JeongShin department in Insadong to get a sleeping pill once a month 
11165,3, Insadong is unchanged and Gongpyeongdong redevelopment next to it approximate pyeong is in progress with  blood flavor 
11166,5,Do insa when you come Joking
11167,5,traditional area in Seoul
11168,3, You shouldnt think about the old Insadong Street This is neither this nor that because it changes a lot 
11169,4, Beautiful crystal and clear in crystal fantasy I was able to buy Orasoma after listening to the chime 
11170,4,Enjoyable place I can get everything I want ;
11171,4, I also saw the art exhibition for free and it was really nice but it was a little cool because there werent many foreigners coming 
11172,4, On the fourth day of Chuseok holiday Without a car in Insadong with a comfortable mind To Insadong by public transportation subway 
11173,5, The difference from regular kalguksu is that the soup taste is unique It tastes a bit tan but it looks like Yiwu has fried garlic and the meat broth is really good The dumplings in this house are also delicious 
11174,4, They sell a lot of cheap things There are many places where food is expensive I dont want to see some foreigners begging while playing music on the street 
11175,4, There are few antiques but the old nostalgia is alive Until the day when Chinese cheap confrontation 
11176,4, While looking at the old things there are many places such as Bukchon Samcheongdong Seochon etc 
11177,5, beautiful cool only the prices are not good for tourists 
11178,5, Palace nearby many traditional and souvenir shops Also beautiful places to have a drink and take photos The tourist place par excellence 
11179,5,Has lots of shops If youre looking to get souvenirs its an nice place to go Also not far from the Hannoks Can see the traditional homes but keep the nice level down because people still live in those amazingly beautiful homes
11180,4, As a cultural street it is Back Alley an alley that can be placed anywhere in the world In addition it is an alley where the enjoyment of eating is the best 
11181,4,After many visits Insadong still holds charm because of all of the happy visitors there 
11182,4, The hall is on the second floor so the convenience of a fast food restaurant is a little colorless 
11183,3, My best friend and poet Daemunho Yuncheol His wife said he was holding a solo exhibition in Insadong so he visited an exhibition hall in Insadong to see his friends face 
11184,5, It is a place where traditional culture can be felt all over the street 
11185,5, Tradition present old and new generations representing the reflection of multicultural people A place like a stupid place in Madangnori that excludes discrimination of 
11186,4, Its still full of new and pretty fancy products and designs You can also enjoy paintings inspired by the gallery and immerse yourself in new color combinations filled with food living and taking picturesIt 
11187,5,Great place to go with family with kids Lots of Artsy shops with crafts if kids want to keep busy The prices are a bit higher than other shopping areas in Seoul but still relatively reasonable
11188,5,This is just stunning Like stepping back into old Korea Get lost in the alleyways Browse eat shop and have a coffee The art the atmosphere and picturesque streets were magical I was having a bad day but this made me happy
11189,4,Touristy street with some interesting handicrafts and souvenirs There is a relatively new shopping block nestled within the street  it has a huge Kakao  Friends store at its entrance The 4storey building with graffiti is also interesting
11190,4,We visit this each time we visit Seoul as there are some nice shops here The only one I avoid is the official tourist place cant think of the name because you are hounded the minute you enter the door Too bad as it is fun to look around here Other shops are not like that My husband especially likes the art supply shops
11191,4,You can find a great deal to do in the bustling neighborhood There are museums palaces temples and shopping all within easy walking distance We stayed in two different parts of Insadong and it was a perfect spot for our time in Seoul
11192,5,Lots of terrific shops and restaurants its a fun artsy district that we had a great couple of hours in Try the dragons beard sweets made right there on the street
11193,5,Insadong has loads of shops and galleries loads of coffee houses and restaurants The palaces are a shortish walk away as is the Hanok area which is also worth the trip
11194,4,Great place to hang out for a couple hours and just take in new encounters with delight Every step is a new adventure here with people culture history art and the tacky
11195,5,Insadong was a place where we could feel the traditional beauty of Korea And Ssamjigil in Insadong was a really beautiful place There were colorful lanterns everywhere I went to a cafe in Ikseondong nearby and it was a remodeled hanok I could feel the beauty of Hanok very well
11196,5,I really like Insadong not as crowded as Hongdae What I like the most was its ambience artsy and peaceful I went to Ssamzigil and it was really nice place Instagramable and pretty
11197,2,Insadong used to be an artisticartisnal haven before it became overy homogenized and dull There is still the occasional good stuff in the back alleys food mainly but the main strip is tourist only traps
11198,5,I wish we had a lot of time to spend here We were in a tour and had a limited time to go around Lots of food to taste A lot of things to see A lot of stores to shop Ill come back for sure
11199,4,I love Insadong quaint market  the small hallways that leads you to unique stores is a refreshing scenery from the busy streets of Myeondong and other shopping districts The area also has restaurants and coffee shops that showcases delicious food  a resting place too if you wish to take a rest from going around Somehow it connects to Ssamziegil which also has a lot of shops  souvenirs clothing food and everything
11200,5,This is a nice neighborhood style shopping area If weather is cooling its a good half day walk through shops cafe and restaurants
11201,4,Well it is true that there are a lots of shopping and foods around It is nice to get a visit but i personally prefer to go to Garosujil for shopping and MyeongDong for foods Desserve a tour if you never been there but after few trips i prefer Garosujil and MyeongDong
11202,5,I would say Insadong is more of a Tourist focused shopping but a very pleasant experience it can get a crazy crowd if you go during the weekend evening
11203,4,Great Location near food shopping and Public transport Walking distance to the main Seoul Palaces
11204,5,Very busy with lots of food and shopping choices Close to downtown major markets and ancient palaces
11205,5,many traditional places like tea houses making this place fabulous the history of Korea Feel We really enjoyed it
11206,5,Saw this place during a day tour when I first got to Seoul There are a lot of little tea shops and dessert places here Also all of the stereotypical tourist shopping that youd want to do is here mixed in with some local boutiques and restaurants
11207,5,Isadong  it took us 10 minutes walk to get there from our hotel in Myeongdong  it was everything it promised to be  great authentic streets excellent shopping sublime street food We bought an amazing woodcarving print from a Master  little shop on the main street not stalls which we framed and love seeing in our home Everything was really well priced and it didnt feel touristy or overcrowded at all Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area
11208,5,Nice place People seem to flock the place Another good and cheap food place Near one of the palace and near the subway Accessible to a lot of places Very easy to move around
11209,4,Another shopping area close to Gyeongbokgung palace This street has a lot of cafes and souvenir shops Sampled a few types a tea in one of the newer establishments however there are a lot of traditional tea houses to explore Lots of good restaurants in and round the by lanes
11210,5,We walk from Cheongdukgung palace to hanok vilage and come out to the street near insadong So many friendly shop with reasonable price U cant feel tired by window shopping Before u know  U will come to the other side of the street
11211,5,Insadonggil is well known as a traditional street and represents the culture of the past and the present It contains a mixture of historical and modern atmosphere and is a unique area of Seoul that truly represents the cultural history of the nation
11212,5,I love this area of Seoul for food shopping and exploring unique artisan shops that offer special souvenirs that you cant find anywhere else in the city Traditional tea shops and great food finds are also found here
11213,5,Insadong is located in Jongnogu district Theres a lot of cafes restaurants galleries teahouses and shops along the alleys on each side You can buy traditional souveneirs here if you want to give something for your loved ones or to remember your trip about Korea
11214,4,Insadong is an open area of restaurants and shops that you can stroll leisurely  enjoying the culture of South Korea We found a great place for some Kim Chi on the 3rd floor of one of the structures
11215,4,cool street with overpriced giftshops but sooo many choices lots of food places very atmospheric we enjoyed 
11216,5,A very famous street in Seoul the capital of South Korea Close to Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changdeoukgung make Insadong very popular with tourists Insadong is also a favorite meeting point Many art attractions and souvenir shops along Insadong No need to fear hunger because there are many restaurants along Insadong There is also a halal restaurant in Insadong that sells Middle Eastern food
11217,5,Finding a good souvenir can be tricky and costly  but most of the souvenirs in this area are basically in the same price range but you do need to visit some shops and make a decision on your own
11218,3,Its a nice enough place but not amazing and probably not worth a dedicated visit However it is near lots of other attractions and certainly worth wandering through
11219,4,Went from the train station to the running man attraction and then up and down the street trying to hunt for trick eye museum Also went up to one restaurant on the second floor to have dagarbj with cheese and octopus To cap it off it was snowing gently that day Beautiful
11220,3,This old area of Seoul is well known for tea houses and theres also a handful of lovely old restaurants  For us it was a visit to Ssamziegil to get our family caricature done A must when you are there
11221,3,Not a place of interest that suits for me but other people might like it Have a lot of stores for sightseeing
11222,5,Get into the Indadong Hanok village lots of trendy little shops and food outlets Does get busy but full of character
11223,5,Come with friends and we had a great time here shopping and taking pictures Its crowded as usual 
11224,5,Very nice place to shop for gifts Lots of hand crafts to choose from This whole area is very artsy and fun
11225,5,Very nice area as compared to Myeongdong Nice restaurants on the second level off the street and providing a fun relaxing place for a meal conversation and watching the activities below Can be crowded though
11226,5,Visited in mid December I prefer this area more than Myeongdong Lots of eateries and lots of shops selling souvenirs There are also shops selling cosmetics So if you are not a hardcore cosmetic person you can actually shop around this area too Ssamziegil is also a place worth visiting It consists of little boutiques stores shops selling cute little knick knacks Just about opposite Ssamziegil there is a toy museum and a tea house cafe They have some pretty yummy looking desserts Weve only tried their green tea ice cream so i cant comment on their other desserts or drinks There is also a huge shopping mall near Ssamziegil
11227,4,This is like the place to hunt for souvenirs to bring home It is a long street with shops and cafes and even has a new mall adjacent to it Many handicrafts to choose from
11228,4,Insadong is a bit of everything hard to put it in a single box so to speak It is a bit touristy no doubt but it also has many other facets to it Street vendors shops restaurants a bit of arts and culture as well a hot pot pf sorts of things But when in Seoul I would say it is a must see and a stroll through the streets is a nice afternoon activity Also to remember that many other key areas of Seoul are not far hence it is easy to combine this with visiting some palaces or myeongdong for example
11229,5,If you are into creative arts and culture this is the place to me There are lots of quirky shops selling handmade embroidery and local arts and crafts There is a beautiful building called Ssamzegil that is dedicated to the local arts and crafts and one can find a lot of treasures in most of the shops The items can be a bit pricey but some are worth having due to their uniqueness Definitely worth a visit
11230,2,Insadong streetmarket is touted as an artistic and antiquities market it was to be one of the highlights of my visit to Seoul It is in fact a very convenient walking street full of small shops and interesting little curiosities but I dont think it can be called in any way an antiques market It is a street walking no traffic which is a blessing with lots of typical vendors of tourist merchandise cafes snacks and so on interspersed with a few ceramics shops and the odd printed art shop For me it didnt do anything artistic nor antique a pleasant diversion from the routine traffic but nothing memorable
11231,3,Walked pass this street on the way to The Runningman Thematic Experience Centre Did not strike me as exciting or there is much to do Visit only if you are around the area
11232,4,If you only have time to do either Myeongdong or Insadong no brainer; skip Insadong But if you can do both then Insadong is a nice couple of blocks of arts and crafts stores with cafes interspersed The little alleyways and shops on the second and third floors are not to be missed as well Yes it is touristy and fashionable but thats how this city rolls On the south end of the street there is a little open plaza where there are often street performers worth a gander And beside the plaza is a manned tourist info booth if you need tourist info of course
11233,4,Very enjoyable area for a stroll along small boutiques and restaurants in a relatively central areas
11234,4,Mostly handicrafts Short street but bustling with people Theres a park across the road at the start of the walking street which is worth a visit Many eateries are by the side alleys A 23 hrs walk about is more than sufficient
11235,4,We were staying at Insadong and hence it was easy to take a round in the area in late evening There are lots of shops with craft work and souveniers street food and organised restaurants We felt safe walking around at this hour 
11236,4,A bit disappointed by the area its for tourists and there is nothing genuine The narrow streets could be nice but again spoiled for groups of tourists
11237,5,Absolutely had fun browsing shopping and snacking as we explored one afternoon People are lovely and it is absolutely a great way to spend a few hours here
11238,5,Shopping is unbelievable love iteverything looks so amazing and everyone are so friendlyMr Park showed us Insadong
11239,5,Lots of local handicrafts scarvesbagsclothespaintingsceramics etc Cafes for set tea n snacks and restaurants for local cuisines Open about 10 till late There are local artisans showcasing their work Beautiful handmade brooches  only in korea Bbq and hot pot restaurants in area so never go hungry
11240,4,If you are going for a relaxing holiday this is the place which you can find a lots of cafe There are some street foods as well
11241,5,Boutiques restaurants check the side alleys for the best ones tea shops Insadong has everything Beware of the more touristic cheap shops where most things are Made in China I found wonderful artists and artisans who are selling their beautiful craft in their small niche Take a couple of hours to explore Insadong
11242,5,Bring enough cash and card as here is full of souvenir and eatery Nice place to walk and long shopping street
11243,4,When you come to Seoul you can experience different shopping experience based on which market place you visit Insadong has its own nuance when it comes to shopping If you are in to masks you will see lot of shops not only selling them but you will find some shops where you can watch a mask being made Just like any other place in Asia one should be able to bargain
11244,5,Get lost in the busy little alleyways of Insadong and find cute little boutiques interesting restaurants and Instagrammable details around every corner
11245,5,A place you can find traditional korea handmade goods and nice street food can be found but they close early at about 5pm daily go early and look at the building and handmade goods here
11246,4,An energetic pedestrian street lined with tea houses restaurants and shops Check out the Ssamziegil complex the painted stairwells a park with a large stone pagoda and gallery of modern art if time allows
11247,4,We spent eight days in this area and found it handy for exploring the palaces and many other attractions It features arty shops restaurants and boutiques It has good transport links to everywhere and if you are keen you can walk to many of Seouls major attractions
11248,5,I loved walking around here The main road has a lot to see but there are branches of small roads that you can also explore Try going to the Ssam Zzi market as well there are lots of handmade items to shop if you dont want to go to massproduced tourist gift shops
11249,5,Insadong was a lot of fun It is a lively area with lots going on It was particularly interesting to see how they make the honeybased stringy deserts the vendor demonstrated the making of it and it worked we ended up buying a bunch Cool area to walk through
11250,5,Staying in MyeongDong it was a fun and healthy walk over to Insadong to see the modern buildings and restaurants plus see the great heritage site with local tour guides They were awesome The food here is spectacular for everyone with an Asian hankering  and of course we arranged a must see DMZ tour the next day Seoul is 1st class
11251,4,This is a nice place to walk around and check out the various shops offering quality art supplies including pigments and brushes
11252,5,Unlike the megacity feel and architecture of the rest of Seoul the Insadong area includes an open compound of very low buildings which comes to life at sunset similar to Taipeis night markets but chic  It includes many diverse restaurants patiseries and fashion shops at a very wide price range carefully designed to have a chic look and uniqueness to each which contribute to the general great vibe of the place In the wider streets you can find cosmetic stores and restaurants open until late There are also great ARVR places highly recommended experience as they are cheap and lots of fun  You will meet there eople from all walks of life coming after a rough day at school or at work to eat and enjoy together and also especially many young people dressed by latest Kpop and japanese inspired fashion
11253,5,Try tea shops and food places in the street They have good vegan  restaurants and lot of souvenir shops Some items are very reasonable and some are very expensive so work out to explore
11254,5,The street has some tourist shops and eateries plus some shops selling antiques You can buy street food look especially for Royal Food You can even get a green tea icecream Starbucks has arrived but the rest of the US commercial tat invasion was nowhere to be seen If you would like to see the more real Insadong an old local told us to walk into the back streets and small lanes which feed into this busy street
11255,4,Based on my observation as the common tourist Insadong is a nice street for a stroll There is quite a number of art galleries and restaurants  I like the weeping willows dotted all along the streets The evening I was there there were some street musicians performing  Perfect place for an evening stroll before and after dinner
11256,4,A nice place for a quick visit There is not a lot to see apart from a long street of shops many of which sell art and handicrafts There are some nice items for sale but quite expensive I was pleased we did not get a hotel there; Myeongdong has much more variety and life
11257,3,If youre tired from all the walking and shopping around Seoul Insadong is the best place to go to stop for a cup of coffee and desserts There are plenty of cafes to choose from some with rather interesting themes and decors A great place to slow the pace down during your travels
11258,5,This is where we bought our souvenirs after walking one whole day Luckily there is a halal Indian restaurant here Worth a visit
11259,5,Insadong is a lovely trendy place to go  we went there 2 day in a roll  its got it unique feel about it  and lots of good restaurant on the side alley way  and lots of shopping around here 
11260,5,We enjoyed a nice stroll here The art galleries and handicraft shops were definitely worth a visit And the cafes here each one offers a unique experience but the most memorable for us was the matcha cafe Wed like to come back and spend more time here
11261,4,Streets are full of a mixture of local traditional  modern shops The main street is shut to vehicles so its an easy wander with lots of side streets off Take time to look in to all the side areas Easy access if staying in Insadong or easy access from subway at Anguk or Jong Gak stations
11262,5,So many interesting shops and art cafes We wish we had more time to explore and look into the crafts and souvenirs They are just quiet pricey but worth it

11280,5,Great transit network very efficient and on time I need tp write 100 characters but i dont need them
11281,3,The main street has been closed to allow pedestrians to walk the entire length It is pleasant enough but a great disappointment as many tourist guides raise expectations beyond what is warranted
11282,3,Little shops line the alleys and they were fun to venture Do note this is touristy area so prices are also high There are interesting shops and tea houses along the way that offer a respite from the heat  we were there in summer  and walking
11283,4,Some beautiful cafes here and lots of options for Jujube tea A bit touristy and gets quieter around 910pm but very vibrant during the day and early evening
11284,4,Insadong is a street close to the royal palaces It is a touristy area and the prices are accordingly A good range of places to eat can be found in the alleyways of the main street There are also a number of bars in the alleys
11285,4,Insadong has a lot of arts and cultural places The main street is primarily for shopping so venture off it for hidden gems
11286,5,Insadong is near Bukchon Hanok Village It is a whole street filled with food and Shopping they sell traditional souvenirs and art pieces It is recommended for people who have an appreciation for arts or are looking to buy traditional souvenirs back home
11287,4,Lots of places to eat and buy things However the prices are not cheap as it is a touristy area We didnt stop long in any of the shops as we were only walking past on the way back to the hotel Good to spend a hour perhaps
11288,5,Here you can find everything related to art and folk crafts souvenirs paintings handicrafts Many galleries small shops Very atmospheric place On weekends and maybe not only many different master classes for children and adults are held
11289,5,This is a kind of place a lot of day tours bring tourists to shop Its nice walkable colorful and safe Plenty of shops and places to eat
11290,4,Insadong is one of the must visits in Seoul There are different kinds of food sold along the street What I like about Insadong is that there are different kinds of souvenir items arts and crafts jewelries and local artists creations here Some items are not cheap but if you find one that you really like better buy it if you think you cant find one like that for a cheaper price You can do a half day or few hours visit here depending on your interests Its also near some of the tourist spots Youll see a lot of tourists walking wearing the hanbok
11291,4,Here is one of the places you can try traditional foods while taking in scenic ambiance of modern and oldworld charms combined Plenty of shops selling tasty delicacies and souvenirs that reflect the old and new Korea
11292,5,I was not sure what this place has to offer But when we visited this place there were so many interesting places to seeshopping and restaurants mostly I like this place because it offered so many things I wish I had so much time to explore this place Maybe on my next visit Who knows
11293,3,I recommend to come here if you need to buy some cultural souvenirs They are all cheap and have good quality If you go check out the handmade stuff as well inside the mall looking place
11294,5,You can buy there gifts souvenirs you can also have a snack or just stroll around looking at the colorful crowd of locals and foreigners Easy to get there from metro station  for example Anguk Line 3 or Jonggak Line 1 My hidden gem was OSulloc Tea House
11295,4,Souvenir shopping here is great and there are many alleys with a wide choice of restaurants with English language menus
11296,5,Stumbled across this gorgeous little village that Id read about but not realised how quaint and quirky it really was Loved it Fantastic place for kids to create their own slime arty pictures candles etc
11297,4,Insadong is a great neighborhood in Seoul for travelers to visit There are good restaurants everywhere and many are not expensive Theres also heaps of souvenirs for sale so its a great spot for travelers to visit
11298,3,To me this is an area that doesnt worth revisiting Restaurants are expensive but not yummy at all The shopping centre is not fabulous either Its a quieter and more traditional area Visiting once is enough
11299,4,A nice selection of souvenir stores so worth the visit for that alone At least on the main street more of a quaint souvenirtourist street rather than the neighborhood feel I was expecting but we enjoyed being able to get all of our gifts in one place
11300,5,Great little side streets with amazing restaurants Neat area for shopping and great food Very near Gyeongbokgung palace We went there to find a place for lunch Watch out for guys asking for donations they tend to target the tourist but are not aggressive just tell them noThere are some neat shops
11301,5,You can find a lot of shops and Restaurants Also some street food Interesting is also a temple at this district
11302,5,Our hotel was close to Insadong and we really enjoyed visiting many times during our stay The restaurants were very good our favorite tea shop MoonBird Only thinks of the Moon was there and many very nice shops
11303,5,As like all Asia the contrasting arquitecture from the temple and the modern buildings give you the taste of the modern Seoul with ancient traditions Frivolous shopping and a mystical stop to observe the lotos 
11304,5,Located in easily walkable distance between the palaces and Myeongdong this small area should be visited for cheap souvenirs also must visit the fun mini shopping arcade called Ssamziegil
11305,5,Good place to buy souvenirs with many restautants incl fantastic vegan ones great cafes ans tea houses Close to many other touristic spots
11306,5,Love to walk Insadong gil It is not quite a pedestrian only as there are delivery vehicles and taxis passing thru during the day but pure pedestrian after a certain hour in the afternoon It is very crowded but still enjoyable to walk thru and experience the many shops restaurants and gift shops Be sure to walk the many side alleyways which are filled with restaurants and shops It is very safe Most of Insadong gil is smoke free another good feature And eventhough some areas are cobblestone it is pretty much flat and straight for wheelchair accessiblity
11307,5,A series of old school fashioned shops and teacoffee houses Certainly worth a look Had a fantastic relaxed time at a tea house there
11308,4,If its hot this is an awesome place to cool down with a shared bowl of shaved ice cream with condensed milk you can pour over that really brings out the taste of the shaved ice whether you start with chocolate or mango or any of the other multitude of flavours
11309,5,Definitely one of my favorite places in Seoul You can definitely feel the traditional and cultural atmosphere here Lots and lots of souvenirs for you to choose from ranging from affordable to slightly pricey Also tons of unique handmade stuffs you can buy to bring home The entire street are long with tons of shops restaurants and coffee shops so you can definitely take your time here and just explore perhaps a whole day here would be good to just hang out and chill too  I came here multiple times during my trip because of the vibes the food are awesome too very traditional mixed with modern Just remember to wear comfy shoes  Once youre done with the main street you can also walk around the area which has plenty of sightseeing with traditional shops temples etc
11310,4,Realky nice area in downtown Seoul with loads of eateries sone good bars hotels and souvenir shops Within easy walk of the two main palaces The Airport bus stops here and its served by the subway I stayed in Insadong and really enjoyed it the place has a good vibe

11314,5,I visited Insadong during a long layover and had a great time A lot of restaurants cafes and shops for souvenirs and gifts

11316,4,Twice I have lived in this area and I really love it  the wonderful souvenir shops the galleries and of course the food places Truly love this area
11317,4,Lots of artsy and traditional souvenirs can be found here but there are also kpop merchandise There are many art galleries but i never went into one The souvenirs are a bit expensive though
11318,4,I like it here as I am into culture Beautiful lanes with beautiful structure It was a nice stroll going down the lanes Saw some tourist dressed up in the traditional outfits beautiful indeed Spent sometimes browsing the souvenirs shops I truly enjoyed this place
11319,4,This area near Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces is the perfect area to stroll when one more palace is just too much There are small boutiques cafes and street vendors to entice you to part with your remaining won  or just stroll and watch other tourists spend theirs
11320,2,It has became too touristic after all the tourist visit here It is not special unless you want to shop something for gift
11321,5,We visited Bukchon village and after we walked to Insadong There is a wide street with alleyways coming off the main drag There are lots of craft and art outlets mixed with cafes and restaurants There is not the hustle and bustle of some other areas which makes it pleasant to stroll look and enjoy A great pocket of Seoul There were very interesting shops selling hand made fans and good souvenirs locally made
11322,4,A quiet place to leisurely stroll among arts and stores selling local handmade items plenty of street food restaurants coffee shops and music Money changer across Starbucks a tourist Information at one end A clean and beautiful cobblestone street conveniently located between 2 palaces  Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changgyeonggung Palace Plenty of benches to rest Also in Insadong you can rent a Hanbok Koreas National Costume to wear to the palace for perfect pictures Very easy to hail a taxi
11323,5,I found some good items for souvenirs and gifts to friends But I have a hard time looking for mens clothing and accessories Enjoyed the walk with the cool breezy air
11324,5,fantastic place to stroll and wander aroundbuying souvenirs for home Even a cat cafe with little munchkin cats
11325,3,Im finding the more areas I visit in Seoul that they are all basically the same Mind you this has some lovely shady trees down this street which make it pleasant There is one particular shop where the guys are making a product from honey and malt and filling it with nutty mixture which is delicious You can see them making them  nice guys too
11326,4,Many lanes and shops so can be confusing if you dont hv good sense of direction But a place worth visiting Opposite one of the lanes is the Joygesa temple decorated with many colourful lantherns in celebration of Vesak Day
11327,5,We came here as part of the Busan City tour and decided to come back again the next day to spend more time in this lovely area The shops are just that bit more unusual than those we visited elsewhere and we particularly liked the antique shops
11328,4,Very art centric and traditional in that no store signage can be in English see Starbucks photo Nice area to walk and browse theres even an alley with antiques
11329,4,We lived in Insadong during our trip  which made it super convenient for quick meals sundries and shopping for knickknacks The main shopping street branches into lanes with teashops restaurants and crafts shops
11330,5,It was so pleasant walking around every street So many restaurants and shops everywhere Its not as crowded as Myeongdong and prices are much better as well Nice quaint shops and food was really good
11331,4,Walked through this area after a visit to some nearby shrines Some good tourist shops and galleries Enjoyable and worth a look
11332,5,This was right behind our hotel There are many shops resturants tea houses and more There was almost too many options to eat We found food stalls and a lot of traditional resturants slightly off the beayen path Not to mention the galleries and museums
11333,5,As I was staying right near Insadong I had the area on my doorstep There are hundreds of restaurants of varying quality and price Generally Ive found dining out in Seoul to be quite expensive but it is possible to find cheaper meals if youre prepared to overcome the lack of language and give the food a go Its delicious There are some great shops in Insadong though a bit touristy for my taste so I didnt actually buy anything Insadong can get very busy on Friday and Saturday nights but that adds to its charm
11334,3,Walk past here by accident There are plenty of individual shops for gifts However I would definite bargain As majority of the time only tourist come over here  The area is quite atmospheric Worth a walk around
11335,5,Well you know how these places usually are Same things over and over with prices varying twofold Stuff made in China You know what Im talking about All this can be found here BUT to much less extent than you would usually see Quite a few unique handmade artifacts lots of art galleries along the street and further to the sides Quite reasonable prices as well The must if you are after something local to bring back home
11336,4,If youre looking for a place to buy local souvenirs this is it There are a bunch of local shops catered to locals more than tourists There is also a buda temple near by There is some street food too Not far from the palace its a short 510 minute walk
11337,3,The main antique  street was little more than a tourist mall but the side streets with their rabbit warrens of buildings with numerous stalls were more interesting though the items for sale looked generally to be of mediocre quality
11338,4,It is a bit atypical shopping area It is a mix of art galleries interesting shops different type of restaurants
11339,5,Insadong is an interesting area where artists sell their products Also small shops with painting articles can be found there Look in the side streets for nice small restaurants with good food
11340,5,It is not like typical shopping onlyplace There are art galleries around interesting shops many restaurants in many types It is worth the time
11341,5,A very wide variety of stores and market type stalls Vist the Sword shop up a side alley  truely amazing array of hand made weaponary as seen in the movies all made here Everything to please the ladies
11342,5,This is the best location for unique and pretty souvenirs Be sure to also stop Nuri Kitchen for the best lunch box lunch ever
11343,4,Used to be one of the best place to visit but now is too crowd  However it is worthwhile to visit Some good restaurants Another nearby place to recommend is Iksondong
11344,4,Was there only around 30 mins but find this place is nice and plenty of picture taking which there is a lot of old shoplots with modern skyscraper behind them Souvenirs are aplenty but didnt check the price as my time is limited here
11345,4,A very nice walking street with lots of souvenir shops and several restaurant to try local specialties some street food stalls also offer local specialties worth trying the street is also near several other tourist attractions
11346,4,It is popular but this is Korea and some Lots of small shops selling all sorts Plenty of craft pper writing materials clothes restaurants coffee and tea houses It is vibrant Well worth a visit
11347,5,There is always something interesting to see or eat in this lovely part of Seoul Easily accessible by metro and close to some of the more frequented Seoul attractions it should definitely be part of your travel plans Lots of handmade crafts pottery textiles Wonderful tea shops to enjoy a moment of rest and restaurants for a delicious meal My favorite place to visit in Seoul and take guests when they visit
11348,5,Insadong has a few street food vendors not much really but lots of street and sidewalk merchandise vendors and small stores and lots of restaurants More good people watching Definitely should be on your list
11349,3,This area is touted as a great place to go and buy artifacts However its more a clothes shopping places Id say as the artifacts arent all that special and look a bit fake not handmade
11350,5,Pretty Street Can easily spend a couple of hours here Brands Ive never seen Got some Chasing Stretch tracksuit pants and Jaju sloppy joe and pearl hoop earrings from street vendor Service was a bit icy but practical Highly recommend
11351,4,We spent a day in Insadong taking in the sights and wandering through the streets enjoying every minute here
11352,5,I love the feel of this placetraditional and modern at the same time Its a nice area to shop here as there are so many shops souvenirs and cafes
11353,4,We went there to eat and found there were multiple alleys and that each alley had several restaurants We didnt know this and immediately chose a restaurant on the first alley we entered We thought of buying trinkets from Insadong to bring home but because the shops on the main street are more of artisan shops showcasing handmade crafts We waited till we got to Namdaemun market to buy cheap goods instead Stingy I know In my defense we bought in bulk so it wouldnt be cost effective for us to buy exclusive items
11354,4,A lovely place to stroll through looking for both locally made unusual and typical souvenirs  Its typically very much full of western English speaking tourists but many of the sellers and stall holders do not speak great English so be prepared to have your translation bookapp out  all park of the experience  If its time for a meal be sure to check out the streets and alleys that run off the sides of the main as they offer great local and international foods at bargain prices
11355,5,Not cheap though but very nice place Also family friendly You can bring your kids and do shopping
11356,5,We visited the area and decided to check out the alleys which had great food places and purchased quite a few souvenirs from here It was touristy but it was still a great experience We want to go back to the poop cafe
11357,5,Insadong street was near our hotel so we walked it several times Always something new to see from restaurants to shops and galleries
11358,5,We experienced the hanbok rental traditional clothing Girls rent the traditional clothing at a cost of about 150US They wear tennis shoes under the dresses and take phone photos of each other in various poses The back of the head is often more photographed than the face or so I saw Shopping is good quality and pricing
11359,5,Insadong is a charming street to walk through Lots of artsy stores and souvenir shops Small eateries give you great food choices
11360,5,Super fun to shop in this district Well known for its cleanliness and great for gifts A must stop for any visitor; also great street food options
11361,5,When youre coming from bukchon hanok village youll walk straight to insadong if youre going towards the city center Its nice with its restaurants and shops
11362,4,A good place to spend an afternoon here walking the shops and having tea at one of the teahouses especially the old traditional types
11363,5,We took a stroll down Insadong visiting various stores along the way The scarves pottery and traditional paintings on fans and wall hangings were fun to look at and peruse We picked up some treasures but enjoyed the opportunity to experience this colorful street of arts and crafts
11364,5,I liked this nice place Good for shopping and food on every step We had fun discovering quaint little places We will be going back soon
11365,5,Lovely area Nice to spend an hour or so walking thru this area Please make sure you look at the galleries Lovely art work
11366,3,We spend about an hour and a half strolling the street Good place for souvenirs art work etc There are some street food vendors Do not miss the building  Ssamziegil where each level is connected by a spiral walkway Interesting mix of shops  artwork accessories glasses watches handicrafts and all
11367,5,Loved this shopping area Most of the stores dont open until 103011 am and most of the stores close around 8 pm Around 530 some street vendors came out on the end of the street with delicious snacks We had heard about a fish shaped ice cone from a friend that was a must try and found it here It was delicious but very sweet
11368,4,This is a great place to take a break for the day at a tea house and then get some shopping in as well
11369,5,The area is pretty nice not just Insadong but the surrounding area within 15 minutes walk radius Recommend a visit when in Seoul
11370,3,Visited on a Friday from about 5pm to 8pm It was extremely quite and slow Not sure if it would be better to visit during the day but for me it was not terribly interesting Enjoyed other areas of Seoul much more
11371,5,Insadong has a rich mix of the old  new buildings shops Interesting shops selling trinkets  traditional stuff Good place to coffeeshop too Easily a day flies past without one realising it
11372,5,I went to Insadong which is a traditional street featuring arts and crafts to buy some souveniers for my family Youll find lots of handcrafted goods in all price ranges and have lots of opportunities to bring home interesting gifts Nice atmosphere especially in the evening
11373,5,Traditional streets Arts and crafts Traditional non expensive restaurants Ver interesting visit Nice and safe
11374,4,The Insadong street shows traditional culture with antique art book stores and tee houses Very famous for visitors

11376,4,Local market a lot of interesting places with souvenirs and street food If you like such things it is worth going to this place and checking it yourself For us it was just ok Quite a lot of people
11377,3,Its good for souvenir shopping and people watching It can be combined with a visit to the nearby Bukchon Hanhok Village which to me is much more interesting
11378,4,This is an charming place where old but precious and traditional goods are on display There are alleys on each side of this charming road Within these alleys are galleries and traditional restaurants teahouses and cafes A must visit while in Seoul
11379,4,Local and traditional charm in the center of Seoul Full of wooden tea houses boutique galleries and street vendors selling traditional snacks Must do in Seoul

11381,5,Take a nice walk in the small streets of insadong Enjoy the cozy tea houses Its nice There are nice different shops there but like always avoid the classic souvenier shops
11382,5,If you are a food lover and looking for a affordable but variety type of foods then this place suit you
11383,5,This section of Seoul is a place I love to get lost within Dont be scared of taking the winding narrow roads because they often lead to hidden treasures like traditional tea shops unique galleries and cozy alcohol joints Great with a first date solo or family  this area even has a St Patricks Day outdoor party with live music Lots of street vendors I mostly go for the desserts Modern mixed with traditional styles Great place to buy souvenirs especially scroll paintings
11384,4,Not very far form the royal palace and national museum definitely worth visiting Especially if you want to see something different than glass steel and concrete Touristy Restaurants souvenir shops galleries street food etc
11385,3,I have 3 daughters 1 son and 1 wife They shopped for 4 hours while me and my son waited in 2 coffee shops I just loved the street food and watching people spend all their money shopping Haha
11386,5,Insadong provided us with many souvenirs treats and fun experiences We enjoyed walking eating and shopping our way through Insadong and would recommend you visit if you are looking to find Name Chops the Ddong Cafe or dragon candy
11387,4,On certain weekends you get cultural dances  Generally a tourist haven for shopping little souvenirs  Oh year there is also a  biscuit stall which biscuits really are made to look like human excrement  Insadong is sure to be a tourist hotspot there are 2 metro stations here at opposite end of the street plus some short walk re Jongno3 and another which name i have forgotten 
11388,5,Great area for tourists  lots of restaurants and shops  and everyone speaks at least functional English  you will see lots of USA tourists because of location near US base  so of course the local merchants responded to the local demand
11389,4,Insadong is a small area which is significantly less crowded than MyeongDong  We came here because our hostel was closeby and we really appreciated the tea shop there You can get all sorts of really nice matcha teas and desserts  The insadong area is also good for getting little souvenirs which we found to be actually quite difficult to find in other areas  You can find lots of tea ceremony places in this area so definitely worth a stroll about especially to get away from the hustle and bustle of other areas
11390,5,It small walking street but have a lot of remarkable places The prices in here are quite expensive just go and see no need to buy anything
11391,4,Loads of local shops selling handmade local goods and mass produced cheap touristy stuff Many cafes and restaurants Lots to keep you busy

11393,5,Interesting street to walk down with a huge choice of inexpensive souvenirs Variety of different shops too
11394,3,a short street selling cultural sourvenir and gifts for visit juz need to take a walk by if convenience
11395,3,I just go there for photostop Need only 1 hour to explore Insadong I dont like Ssamziegil Here we only see the traditional house people are wearing hanbok and some souvenir shops
11396,5,I have been there twice In the summer it is very crowed populated by local visitors which means it is not a place for tourists A few days ago it was less crowded but still interesting even though one can see a lot of shops selling cheap products  There is a very interesting restaurant in the area called Sanchon worth eating there It is presented as eating monastery food It is very spectacular plentiful and the service is excellent
11397,5,Went to Ssamzigil a cool retail center with 4 floors of fashion art  home goods shops around an open central courtyard It look like a Harry Potter scene too Very nice experience
11398,4,It likely goes without saying that Insadong is a tourists paradisebut oddly enough not really in a bad way There are loads of inexpensive cute souvenirs but if you look around long enough youll also find genuine quality goods for not too terribly much Many of the shops sell the same basic souvenirsbookmarks chopsticks small silky bagsso dont worry about shopping around too much Antiques ceramics and paintings can all be found as well albeit for a higher price point than the 1000 won postcards
11399,4,Loads of highquality goods to view and purchase The masks were especially well done Nice walkable area close to the subway
11400,5,This is the place for souvenir shopping A small street that is less crowded than the main markets there are numerous shops selling souvenirs There are also little arts and crafts shops If arts and crafts you will be in paradise While there we ate at the Indian restaurant Nirvana which was excellent
11401,5,This place is a walking distance from our hotel and every night Ive walked around to this street to buy street food Its also the street where you can find bargains Theres also a restaurant on that street that specialize a braised beef ribs that its so delicious We ate at the restaurant 4 times and ordered the same thing all the time
11402,4,A great place to pick up souvenirs and to take pictures Make sure to check out Ssamzigil for more aunthetic souvenirs and art
11403,5,Fantastic place that is reminiscent of a sleepy mediterranean village Wonderful shops museum galleries and cafes
11404,4,December is peak season so the streets food stalls and stores were busy but still pleasant enough to enjoy  Not as big and exciting as Myeongdong Street but has its own vibe  Look out for Ddong Bread Weird but must be tried
11405,5,Nice shopping area where you also can have some food and drinks We loved our walks through this area
11406,5,The kids totally enjoy the craft work at the basement of insadong Good to have more unusual craftwork there available for kids
11407,4,One of the main street shopping places in Seoul Lots of varieties of shops and many nice souvenir shops
11408,5,If you want a quiet place to shop minus the crowd we find Insadong is a good choice Also sufficient restaurants around to satisfy your empty stomach too
11409,3,Mostly souvenir shops with restaurants and coffee shops in between If youre looking for more shops with a wide variety of merchandise and taxfree goods better go to Myeongdong
11410,3,An old shopping street with lots of shopping snd street food stall One place with multi storey open air building is unique and attract lots of youngster to hang around Lots of artistic work like handicraft  clothing etc
11411,4,It is a must visit place if you are in Seoul where you will find all the traditional things of Korea which includes souvenirs food clothes and what not It is a free walk area with full lighting and you can enjoy the whole atmosphere whether you shop or not You wont come empty handed if you are there  Thx
11412,5,Cool to explore the art galleries and museums  street stalls selling handicrafts were really awesome too
11413,5,My family and I love Insadong Check out any little side street and get swept away in to a magical place Calitacos is a 1010 Everything was delicious English speakers as well
11414,4,Nice tea houses to keep warm in winter months Lots of knick knacks and arts and crafts to look at and buy  A good place to spend a couple of hours to soak in the artsy side of Seoul
11415,4,We can here on a late morning and took a walk around this area There are quite a few shops selling art pieces and these are really quite nice Of course there are many souvenir shops and eateries the latter of which you should explore the little lanes and alley ways and you will find many of these eateries some of which are packed The mall Ssamzigil is Aldo worth a visit as it is made up of many stores selling very unique items
11416,5,Just walk dont go by bus I and my daughter walked about 15 minutes from Myeongdong market and surprised I saw river garden wow its beautiful
11417,5,Where to start So many little shops tea houses restaurants to choose from You can pass half a day there play in the labyrinth practice your baseball swing at the batting range enjoy the free shows on the weekends but dont forget to visit those small streets so many treasures to be found there
11418,3,Insadong is definitely a place of history Souvenirs are cheapest here and aplenty However shops close early around 89pm Ssamziegil is the main point here as the vendors are artists selling things you would not find elsewhere The poop bread near the entrance tastes great
11419,5,Went to check out the different stores there and the 2Cat Cafe  Lovely  pretty stores and restaurants Take your time when you are there to check out the lanes as well as u will be surprised what youll find
11420,4,This was our second visit to Insadong and it was just as interesting We enjoyed the art shops in particular and the restaurants Well worth a stroll
11421,5,Spent an amazing afternoon roaming the Insadong old street Many touristy shops but they are a great place to buy pretty souvenirs like pouches and purses in traditional pattern  Many nice tea houses to have afternoon snack Spent about 34 hours here
11422,4,Especially on friday nights this maze of alleys are superfilled with good foods good drinks good scenes and fantastic moments Lots of visual details Architectures and interiors are unique and creative
11423,4,I felt a slower vibe in Insadong Cant explain why but meandering its many narrow side streets seemed the right thing to do Many tourists and locals traverse its main street I suggest you take the elevator to the top floor of Ssamzeigil Mall and walk down its sloped floors skip using the stairs It is fun to watch many male and mostly females walk around in their rented Hanok outfits feeling like someone else from another time I think the going rate is about 10000 Won for 2 hours There are lots of places to eat here We thoroughly enjoyed our food choices at Doma and the manager Jun Ann spoke English very well You will experience the language barrier is South Korea  but that shouldnt get in the way of having a happy and memorable time here
11424,5,Stayed in this area A nice place full of arts  handicrafts Lots of good eatery nearby too Feel free to explore this place
11425,4,I like this place is relaxing and enjoyable to walk along the street and see the art pieces display from the shop There are some good eatery too
11426,4,I always love visiting insadong easily accessible by train at the anguk station I usually have lunch at one ofthe small local Restaraunts  cafes where food is prepared by grandmothers There are heaps of cute shops arts  galleries and food vendors  It is well worth a visit to unwind
11427,5,Insadong is interesting place to go while were in Korea Many unique cafe hand craft souvenir If you like unique souvenir I recommend you to go there Many store left and right in 1 way Spare time to enjoy
11428,4,For market shoppers thisis a more contained market area a bit quaint and classier than other larger markets Prices are a little higher and sellers are a bit more aggressive You can still bargain fora fair price Very clean Known for pottery in this market
11429,4,This street is a good place to do some window shopping find a few antiques souvenirs and try some local Dragon hair candy  Just a few steps into the street if you are entering from the intersection of Insadong and Samueldamero street you will find a large souvenir shop and the Paris crossaint cafeteria; the first is a good place to shop for some arts and craft prices are negotiable and they can ship worldwide so ask and the cafeteria is a good place to get some coffee and dessert while you take a break from a day full of visits  Along the street youll find all sorts of souvenir shops catering to every taste you might have  Strollers and wheelchairs will have no problem moving trough the area
11430,4,Must visit place  a nice long street with handicrafts local product and fashion Amazing shops and local food restaurant
11431,5,A must visit once area in Seoul  where the old meets the new  Quaint teahouses and traditional eating places go hand in hand with modern bars and fast food joints  along with small boutiques selling designer wear  accessories  artifacts and souvenirs
11432,5,Loved the area A stroll of old and new Great for inexpensive shopping Linas is there for coffee and pastries
11433,5,this is a great part of town with something for everyone all sorts of shops cafes and restaurants we had lunch here among 250 different places to choose from looks like they all serve about the same thing but Id recommend walking down a smaller less traveled alley and go to one of the quaint little restaurants they are super cute and a lot of fun  this is a great place to buy your souvenirs as well the street vendors are very nice  there is something Ive never seen before herea cafecare cafe makes me wonder if you have coffee and eat cats or you bring your kitty as your companion kind of odd
11434,4,this is a busy food alley with many small restaurants that are busy for lunch and dinner but otherwise rather deserted
11435,5,Insadong is a charming area to spend a couple of hours The Main Street is insadong  Gil and there are interesting side streets There are antique shops art galleries stationery and art supply stores pottery boutiques resturants and tea houses Several boutiques I visited had beautiful and unusual things
11436,4,Great shopping area plus plenty of restaurants antique shops art studios to look at plus nearby temples good place to visit
11437,5,This place was a great surprise for us as it was so close to our hotel honestly if youre looking for great local food or souvenirs this place has everything and pretty reasonably priced we only had a stop over here but we definitely are coming back to Korea again and see more
11438,5,We came here in the afternoon on a Friday The street was lively with so many locals and tourists alike We had lunch in one of the Dakgalbi places and had drinks at the cat cafe upstairs  Along the street there were many vendors and shops selling beautiful pottery art materials food clothing and more  It was such a great place to start our trip in Seoul
11439,5,Lovely neighborhood with very atractive shops where you can purchaise qualitative good especialy women clothes and souvenirs in reasonable price without need to burgain too much Good atmosphere clean and friendly Prices not on the cheap side but fair
11440,5,I love this area because this is where the Ibis Ambassador Hotel is I love the little bars and shops Best place if you want a small place to hangout with friends
11441,4,I have to admit visiting Insadong was one of my favorite parts of our trip You can find homemade souvenirs for very cheap here Plus the street food We tried a poop shaped pastry with chocolate in the center and it was so good
11442,5,A place to be when you are looking for your pasalubongs for your family Also Ssamziegil is a place to be when you are looking for a unique items
11443,4,There are many alleys in Insadong and you probably want to see it all I went there and walk in the main street only and enter the Ssamziegil Shopping Complex which full of artsy things
11444,4,This is a long street with many attractions and little quirky monuments and a beautiful wall Muriel  Lots of shops eateries and cafes Lots of interesting side alleys with restaurants and art shops Beautiful park at the end with an old temple and square
11445,4,Nice stroll along the insadong main street Not as crowded as places like myeongdong  Explore the smaller streets to discover non touristy restaurants but the staff usually do not speak English nor have English menu However the food is fantastic at these local restaurants  Tip follow the locals who make a beeline for the best restaurants during weekday lunchtime
11446,5,Great shopping for both the traditional and the modern items Prices are lower than in Myeongdong and the crowd is not as many
11447,3,We visited Insadong on a busy Sunday to experience the crowds street food and lively atmosphere We were disappointed at how many souvenir shops there were on the main street all selling the same cheaply made things We much preferred wandering down the side streets and alleys they have far more character than the main street
11448,5,Lots of market stalls to see with food and trinkets being sold Do check the little side street as there are some good architecture to see and interesting restaurants and art shops
11449,5,If youre looking for an area thats chic yet quaint youll love the little alleyways of Insadong just waiting to be discovered Lots of artisanal cafes and upcoming designer stores here Food prices are on the high side but i guess youre paying for the decor and artsy ambience There were also some vendors hawking street food such as rice cakes and croquette The locals come here in all their vintage finery to take pictures Even if youre not feeling flush its worth a walk through just to feast the eyes
11450,5,If you have time to visit this area pretty close to some embassies and temples the hart of Seoul you can walk on the street and visit a lot of gifts shops traditional restaurants and have fun
11451,5,Lots of great shopping handmade jewelry and clothes cafes and how in the Wall restaurants Definitely a must
11452,5,Insadong area gives you surprises as some of their shops I can say most of the shops are selling unique stuffs which we enjoy going into every shops to check thing out really worth to walk around and spend some time in this area I did not get the name of the shop lots but they have a yellow word  on the outside of the building Every small shops in there carry their own products and we spend like hours to check every single one out
11453,4,Loved the variety of art filled shops for shopping and you cant go wrong with your own personalized stamp I counted at least five shops that make them
11454,4,This is one of the places that I am fascinated in Seoul I really like watching artists doing their own craft They are showcasing their skills through their work that you can see in their own gallery If you are interested and get a remembrance just choose the one you like the most
11455,5,Many restaurants and shops in this street Must Insadong Ssamjigil wonton restaurants beside Ssamjigil street food tea house 10000won bag souvenir shop
11456,4,Vibrant crowd nice place to take pics and chill at the cafes there Suggest to go on weekday to avoid crowd
11457,3,Insadong used to be a great place to visit; small production artisans practicing their craft and selling their wares at a terrific price since there was a lack of middlemen restaurants that were painstakingly true to the roots of the dishes they prepared and when the sun went down a nice local nightlife offering a variety of drinks and food at reasonable prices where people can sit and talk for hours  Then the rents started to go up and the artisans were forced out and replaced by shops selling inferior products of lower quality The interesting mom and pop restaurants went away in search of cheaper rent The nightlife got glitzed and glammed for the tourist dollars that always seemed to grow yearly Analytics have determined what you want to buy and marketers have designed this product mix or maximum return on investment  Thats not to say all the shops are gone but the neighborhood has definitely turned a corner and it is more tourist trap than artisan collection  There are still some famous old restaurants at the edges of Insadong that are worth checking out so the general area isnt such a wash  If you visit Insadong it will be interesting but not the place of its reputation at least not any more
11458,3,Alot of unique shops and also antique shops Visit ssamziegil market on the main road of insadong Unique mallbazaar with oneofthekind clothes furniture etc Plenty of street food along the main road
11459,4,We visited Insadong on a rainy day but armed with umbrellas had a really great time exploring the many art and craft shops In addition the are stores selling ice creams food souvenirs and everything else  In particular is the Ssamjigil mall which specializes in arts and crafts and the Poop Cafe also located in the mall  Would like to come here again in finer weather and to explore the smaller lanes that run adjacent to the main street
11460,5,Forget the modern malls this place is shops after shops after shops and it gives you a great walking work out visiting and seeing all that is available
11461,4,Very busy all sorts of shops small but good restaurants All explorable on foot and within a reasonable time span
11462,5,Insadong is good place to meet with friends over coffee The overall surrounding is also good for deserts and coffee There are lots of coffee shops in insadong so anyone can explore many new coffee shops Overall best place to hangout with friends and also after office hours for dinner as there are various options for food and different style of restaurants
11463,4,Insadong has a long main street full of souvenir shopsFrom clothes crafts jewelry ceramics and a lot more you will find them hereThe side streets are an added bonus You will find old houses that have been maintained and converted to restaurants along these narrow streets If not for the modern amenities inside these housesshops it feels like walking back in time
11464,5,This is the place for souvenirs but they ask for cash and will even take US dollars at some stores in between lots of great places to eat and drink You are tempted to spend hours getting small gifts
11465,3,We combined a walk through Insadong after a morning visiting the Gyeonbokgung Palace and the Bukchon Hanok village both a short walk away A friend had said it was a good place to look for gifts and ceramics In fact we didnt buy anything but enjoyed looking round the souvenir shops and galleries and we noticed a lot of restaurants in the area It was really busy obviously a popular place A couple of nights later we decided to go back for dinner but all the shops were already closed and it was also hard to find a restaurant that was still open We did find one but they were closing at 830 and turning customers away from about 8pm so make sure you go during the daytime or eat early if going for dinner
11466,3,I imagined the main Insadong area being much larger and was slightly disappointed The area is very nice however with tree covered walking areas and helpful information center staff Area has a large amount of private art gallery and supplies stores Some very good familyrun restaurants are located here in the many narrow alleys
11467,5,I really like this place You almost got everything there what you need its a really nice place to walk around shopping and meet up with friends
11468,4,Great street with various shops  juju tea art  craft fashion galleries  plenty of traditional restaurants But try not to go in the weekend as it gets very busy
11469,4,I stayed in a hostel in this street the times i was in Seoul nice and safe in evening also nice to walk a zone is auto free from a hour
11470,4,This area is more the historical part of Seoul Oldstyle architecture of houses abound but more away from the main touristy Insadong Street Walk up the side streets for a more authentic look at this area It is a bustling area The main Insadong Street is full of shops for nicnacs and art supplies Take a look but discover the wider area Good access with underground rail Wear comfy shoes as you will walk a lot
11471,2,I lived in Seoul 20 years ago and Insadong was a charming area with traditional tea shops artisans and restaurants all houses in traditional buildings I was shocked to see what it has become Many of the traditional buildings are gone and there are so many shops mostly selling junk It was almost unrecognizable and a huge disappointment A victim of its own success i guess
11472,4,Loads of shops selling everything and lots of street vendors as well hawking all kinds of snacks Try the local cotton candy using rice as a base  Lots of great souvenirs  Clothing is also available  Lots of fun if you like shopping
11473,4,We stayed near Insadong Street By walking distance one will be able to access to many tourist spot and Metro Station Good place to recommend tourist
11474,5,While touristy it is still a great spot for shopping and just enjoying Seoul Street food was excellent
11475,5,While touristy the main street of Insadong is still a great place to shop and explore for souvenirs and trinkets When I was here a large group of people were parading around and playing music and were dressed in costumes not hanbok and it looked like they were acting out a play The side streets show a more authentic side of the area which Id highly recommend you check out too
11476,5,Insadong at first seems like a huge tourist trap full of packed souvenir shops but if you venture down the alleyways in search of a hanok tea house you will be transported back in time Also check out a really cool shop with stamped maps from the 1500s
11477,4,Arrived during lunch time Full house and we have to wait for available seat friendly owner and certainly must go restaurant if you visit South Korea
11478,5,I personally like this alley its nice and calm most of the time even though tourists are there Lot of shops to buy souvenirs and dine Colorful area Must go if you are in Seoul Jogyesa Temple is nearby so must visit it if you are in this area
11479,4,This is a good place to stop for lunch and dinner Local food and shops everywhere Small and narrow alleys which are quite rare to find in this skyscraper city Absolutely worth a visit
11480,4,Very fun place to shop for souvenirs The place itself is beautiful Lots of good restaurants with reasonable prices You can spend around 4 hours here including meal
11481,4,This is one of the most wellknown touristic streets in Jongro Especially for foreign tourists  There are many average souvenir shops fancy cafes and restaurants So visitors need to study in advance to avoid tourist traps and to get real good ones Or spend some time to hang around  I am a bit disappointed to hardly find affordable tea houses though
11482,5,There are plenty of souvenir shops around Not as cheap as Dongdaemun market but still good The shopkeepers are friendly and some can speak English The little alleys have hidden restaurants and very cheap accommodation if you are backpacking
11483,4,Nice area which at weekends is closed to traffic Lots of souvenir  antique painting and writting shops Above which are many places to eat and some great tea houses Dont stay on the main street go up all the side alleys as well
11484,4,Very fun street  definitely worth a quick stroll and you should check out Ssamzigil shopping center  but definitely feels a bit touristy If youre trying to buy nontouristy knickknacks Id recommend checking out other spots
11485,5,Always a great place to visit in Seoul Even when its crowded Insadong offers a relaxing atmosphere because of the architecture and cultural vibes There is a quaint little teahouse see pictures right in the middle of Insadong that I visited where you can buy traditional Chinese tea and teapots and a tea master brews tea for you It was just lovely and the tea was so refreshing I also loved that there was a vegetarian restaurant there since I dont eat meat
11486,4,Nice place for a tourist to visit You can find lots of traditional tea houses gift shops etc However it can be a little too touristy
11487,5,Great gift shops we bought many goods a memories here Very interesting shop where the woman who ran it had made EVERYTHING in the shop herself amazing
11488,3,There are plenty of restaurants and shops that sell traditional piecesartwork The street is not very long You can tour the whole place in an hour or two
11489,5,The market and Main Street have a huge selection of souvenirs for great prices Unique little shops and restaurants down narrow lanes I really enjoyed the 25 hrs we spent here  The metro stop is Anguk on the orange line 3
11490,5,The area represents what it was used to be like before the whole Industrial revolution and economic boom  Me and my wife used to date alot there and the place along with Bukchon and Seochon is truly old Seoul that has been the nations capital for centuries
11491,4,Insadong is so nice to wander around since its not so crowded as other areas You see the typical stores like artbox and lots of nice little cafes around there I would definitely recommend going to the small mall which is in the center of Insadongs main street
11492,3,Insadong is a nice and relaxed shopping area There are many main stream souvenirshops and some restaurants Nothing vey special but if you are in the area I would take a look
11493,4,Many restaurant choices Art galleries Good area to buy souvenirs Best enjoyed by strolling around the area Visit the Jogyesa temple then visit this area
11494,5,Decided to pay a visit to this location for its historical value and modern touches Basically all of Korea But it was a very relaxing walk with some good shopping good seats and surprises There is an amazing restaurant located all the way at the very end of invading you would never know its there but its where the celebs go to eat its called BukMakGol There are amazing jewelry shops art works and oh yeah the side entrance to the Presidents Blue House Great for couples
11495,5,Insadong is my favorite place of all Seoul it is rich in history full of traditional restaurants and tea houses but most of all art galleries
11496,5,Nice place for tea and bingeingThe lady is very friendly and do not visit this place in the weekendfully pack
11497,4,this is a good place to buy products for friends and family though most products made in China lot of restaurants to have a quick beer but seven eleven is cheapest
11498,3,Insadong as an area looked to be pretty touristy and gimmicky The Insadong PR and Tourist Info center was good for hanbok pictorials only 3 per person The Jogyesa Temple was a calming place to catch your breath I would go here again to try out the teahouses in the area Ssamzigil mall has a lot of touristy gimmicks if you have time to spend you can check those out but if not Id recommend steering clear
11499,5,I loved walking along Insadong Its really another way of appreciating Korea through the sights sounds and the tastes I found an artwork that I loved and a place for good tea and desserts Its worth the walk especially when you want to experience the artsy side of Korea
11500,3,Too many shopping places Korea is trying hard to get money out of tourists Some decent food places in the area
11501,4,Not so crowded like Myeongdong Shopping Street Insadong offers various arts and great places to see
11502,4,A place where you can see a lot of arts and crafts and interesting souvenirs Nice to walk in the morning before the crowd arrived Few restaurants worth trying and a place where you can find hidden treasures
11503,4,This place you get to see a little side of old Korea Of course you can find lots of souvenirs and food place
11504,5,Good for families and even better with friends as this is a chill out venue that cool vibes Fun at night
11505,5,Nice area to walk around Small interesting places to eat and shop Friendly shop keepers and not bery crowded in morning Many shops did not open until 10am But maybe that was because it was summer
11506,5,It was amazing to walk around Insadong satrting from the village ending to the Insadong market The village maintained its traditional look and so are he markets  Manal Oman
11507,4,Insadong is a lovely place to visit Although the souvenirs that were available here we could have also purchased in the underground markets Its a great place to spend a day and enjoy the touristy shops hire a hanbock and visit the castles
11508,5,we bought hanboks here it was pricy but good quality We also bought dojang  Wood is more affordable than stone Thanks
11509,5,This place is very beautiful and so many shop in there But when weekend very crowded so we not recomended to enjoy this place on weekend We want to come again to this place if we back to korea
11510,4,This is a very lively area with lots of shops selling paintings souvenirs and other handicrafts  There are also interesting little shops and traditional restaurants in the smaller side streets
11511,3,a great place in the city to pick up souvenirs like metal bookmarks key rings magnets chop sticks handicrafts mother of pearl jewelrydisplay boxes as well as more unique keepsakes There is a Hanbok photo place at the Tourist Information centre if you just want to put one on and take a photo Picked up some lovely jeweled for cheap here Lots of little places to eat off the street in little laneways We found a tiny place doing Mandoo dumplings which was fabulous a really authentic feel The cart selling cocktails amused us Pick up some cash on your way here I ran out and it was hard to find an ATM let alone one that took my card
11512,5,We had a few hours free on a Saturday morning before heading to the airport and based on reviews here decided to head over to Insadong Im so glad we did Most of the stores open by 10am  there is a mix of stores selling traditional pottery artworks as well as souvenir shops and more expensive boutiques and antique stores Restaurants tea rooms and snack shops are plentiful There was a youth orchestra playing traditional music near the park From Insadong it is a short walk to several other area sites
11513,5,Insadong is a ten minute walk from myongdongjust across from dongdemunwent to a lovely cat cafe thereate at little India cafe it the curry was just ordinarytrust me Im a chef myselfbut at least it was meatlovelt casual area for soeveneirs and shopping
11514,5,in evening we scrolled down in the market I found bit expensive so not preferred any shopping but enjoyed street food  very nice stayed there for 2 hours
11515,4,I had looked forward to walking along the streets in Insadong There were plenty of unique shops and street vendors along the way so I had no troubles spending my money  As it was Monday afternoon the streets were not too crowded
11516,3,Shopping center whether for the expensive or cheap Some gifts can be obtained here Places to eat are also many choices Easily reachable by subway or taxi
11517,3,It is a haven for arts and crafts enthusiasts nevertheless good to browse through the many shops which are a bit different from the meongdong area
11518,5,I enjoyed walking through this area with its numerous shops galleries and restaurants The Poop Cafe is also located in this area Insadong is within walking distance of the Gyeongbokgung Palace
11519,4,Love this little pocket of Seoul Great little restaurants and cafes Specialty and artsy shops and galleries make this a special little area Just a few minutes from Myung Dong
11520,4,We stayed at the Centermark hotel for 5 nights which is in the heart of Insadong The city is very lively with a very busy alley of all sorts of stores and restaurants
11521,4,Full of people shops and small restaurants Good place to collect souvenirs though the choice is not very wide
11522,5,Hold on to your wallet This place has many cute things I barely able to hold my urge to splurge here While you are here find hotteok red bean sweet fried bun stall and enjoy warm hotteok
11523,5,Insadong also known as Ssamziegil is a famous tourists attraction The centre point of attraction is the beautifully decorated origami hanging above between buildings There are loads of souvenir shops around which is suitable for us tourists to spend our money on  If you are feeling tired fret not because inside Insadong itself lies numerous restaurants cafes and desserts just waiting for you to discover Is it worth your time UTTERLY YES
11524,5,Trendy area close to the Royal Court Plenty to domust see the changing of the guards Museums a plenty in the neighbourhood
11525,5,We had fun exploring the quaint shops Souvenirs food etc line the street We took the subway to get to the area The people at the information center were very helpful This is a must visit place in Seoul
11526,5,Such a cute location to visit Even if you only have a few hours it is worth seeing Lots of cuteness
11527,5,It was indeed and great shopping destination for those who love arts and culture you can see everywhere the pride of koreas culture and arts
11528,5,Really enjoyed this area of Seoul Small shops Many small restaurants Not a very large area and very manageable Fun to wander into the shops and see different merchandise Spent a lovely few hours including tea at Osulloc tea house Great fun
11529,5,Its a quaint area with a local flavor They seem to offer a lot of tea in this area which is great if you are looking for tea The street is very pretty and there is certainly enough to look at to spend 2 or 3 hours here
11530,5,Not as crowded as Myeongdong Shopping Street There are so many artistic stuffs being sold eg ceramics calligraphy mask and so on You can also find keychain or other souvenirs you can easily find those things in this place But if you want to find the best price for the souvenirs better for you to shop at Namdaemun market  There will be some food street seller in the evening You can also visit Ssamziegil unique building with many artistic things you can shop and join workshop there  Insadong has different specialty compared to Myeongdong Myeongdong provide many cosmetics store but Insadong provide many artistics stuffs Visit both of them if you visit Seoul
11531,3,It is a shopping area with shops and eateries Worth a walk through Plan to have a meal there Look out locals and tourists who rent local traditional outfits for photo opportunities
11532,4,Insadong is hard to avoid when you are in Seoul as its kinda between the 2 main palaces Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung and South of the Bukchon Hanok Village The main thoroughfare is interesting with many shops and street stalls but its a wander into the alleys where you will find the real gems There are many independent galleries around and shops selling pottery We found a traditional tea house which our friend brought us to 2 years ago which seemed to be attached to an art gallery Dawon judging by the reviews from here We also found a place which sold some delicious giant dumplings Must visit when in Seoul  Insadong has something for everyone
11533,4,I visited Insadong following the 10 top attractions in South Korea I must say I liked it since my arrival there are shops nice restaurants street food local souvenirs antique shops artisans cartoonists and many more Its certainly a vivid colorful attractive place to visit I also had a great time looking at locals dressed up in their traditional clothes coming and going from and to Insadong
11534,5,Quiet and clean shopping center with an artsy background There are lots of quaint shops along with delicious restaurants and coffee shops Very enjoyable
11535,5,Therere many souvenir shops restaurants cafe along the main street Many people in weekend Just looking around is fun
11536,5,We really enjoyed the walk down the long shopping street in Insadong There are cute shops and loads of places to stop for lunchdinner You will find nice gifts here and there are artsy shops not just your run of the mill cheap souvenir places
11537,5,lots of shopping and eateries explore the hanok in the back alleys we spent an entire afternoon here
11538,4,This is another market in Korea with many fakes The prices were a bit high but I did find a couple of items to take home with me It is always fun to walk these markets
11539,5,There are many shops and restaurants here There is even a cat cafe A really nice street for strolling and lots of things to see
11540,5,Visited a temple across the street and then headed down Insadong Range of shops many handmade items a fancy green tea place and other kitschy shops Dressed up in hanboks and took pictures for 20
11541,4,Fun time to eat shop and see Best place for souvenir and street foods I wouldnt say completly cheap but more choices available Best snack for us was Dragons Beard candy Its made from fermented honey and corn flour with peanut sesame filling They have chocolate flavourgreen teaalmond and plain All the fillings inside remains same only the outer part flavour changes They make the candies right in front of your eyes
11542,4,We walked along the main Insadong shopping street Shops mainly catered for tourists selling souvenirs etc Quite a few cafes along the street situated on the second storeys of buildings Many restaurants too
11543,4,Along this street you can find so many souvenir shops selling south korea  handcrafts and maybe there is no similar place in Seoul or at least i dont knowthe products are not cheap comparing to other south asia countries but worth a visit
11544,5,Highlight of my recent trip Wonderful pedestrian street area with countless stores and high quality restaurants Stores have everything from the usual tourist tat through homemade artcreative stores to high end pottery and jewelry
11545,5,Walking along the streets of INSADONG makes you feel you are in the old era of Korea Full of living culture souvenirs etc
11546,5,My family and I paid a visit to Insadong in the afternoon There were many shops in the area as well as some rather interesting tea houses We visited 2 of the tea houses where we enjoyed our afternoon tea and snacks Overall it was a wonderful place to spend a lazy afternoon
11547,1,Starbucks Insadong only one in Asia that wanted to charge extra for a glass of water with your 6 coffee Excuse me Cheap Cheap
11548,5,Definitely the place to be if you like to party and have a good time Clubs cafes and bars lined up next to one another and loud music playing in the street Liked the place a lot and wish to spend more time here Again in terms of safety it seems that there is relatively low crime rate in Seoul in general We felt completely safe walking these streets at night Plenty of taxis in the area and no waiting time to get one even at night
11549,3,a good outdoor shopping area that you should visit when your in Seoul I havent take my time in this place due to the extremely cold weather a pleasant and a good place to visit
11550,3,We were here at 9pm and some of the shops are already closed From what we can see this area is mostly cafes restaurants and souvenir shops Not attractive for me but I am sure some of you out there will appreciate this place However plan to come early maybe late afternoon latest
11551,4,Plenty of options here to shop eat take a souvenir back home The price is good and negotiable Try for the small shops outside which are cheaper Walking around the place is a good time as well
11552,5,Definitely touristdriven but there are some shops that have real authentic goods that are great for gifts and souvenirs They are in between the more cheap knickknack shops Theres a hidden gem tea house down an alley way that cannot be beat And walk to the top of the shopping center for the poop emoji cafe Dont miss their pancakes
11553,5,A small street full of antiques shops Really a place to go while visiting Seoul Spent time looking at small stuff there
11554,5,We visited this place twice during our short stay at Myeongdong area We love the vibes here very pretty and charming and good for souvenirs shopping  The street is not very long but very lovely with shops restaurants cafes etc lining the street and side lanes By the way the Alive Museum is located there as well next to the tourist information booth  We walked back to Myeongdong area without much trouble although we could take the metro but getting up and down the stations some hard to find escalators were more troublesome Along the way we even had a short walk on the pretty Cheonggyecheon Stream too
11555,4,You could find anything here without being too overcrowded like Myeongdong  Nice area to stay too touristy but a short walk to the palace area and nearby there are mix of shops for Antiques cafes restaurants art supply and cosmetics  You could also find cool coffee shops craft beer at the back alley The streets are nice and breezy with lines of trees On Sundays older people hang out by the park and some church choir preaching and singing
11556,5,Though a bit touristy this street has a lot of charm and fun little handmade goods and art everywhere you look Definitely has a different vibe than many of the other areas in Seoul
11557,5,Althogh I appreciated the vibe of Hongdae I really felt more comfortable in Insadong as it is more laid back Still plenty of shopping available only without the frenzy
11558,5,What a lovely place to spend an afternoon We were treated to a variety of sights and sounds at a traditional arts and craft type village The people were warm and the food was great as well
11559,4,Walking around day or night this place is interesting A lot of place to eat are also aaound this street We really enjoyed it
11560,4,I liked this place because there are some street food souvenir shops and restaurants I think is one of the places you need to visit been in Seoul
11561,4,It feels like old and new blended into 1 place Insadong offers an unique blend of modern arts and crafts shops Can be crowded but that is the charm of it Try the food I like the dragon beard candy
11562,3,A long street of arty type shops selling independent made jewellery and other arty stuff for tourists Seems to be mostly independent run shops A few cafes and eating places along the street
11563,4,I have visited Insadong already many times Although it is very touristic it is always nice to stroll aroung on a weekend day and to take in the athomsphere Just avoid the typical tourist traps If you walk just a few steps away from the main road crossing Insadong you will find very nice corners and very good local restaurants
11564,5,Loved this place Must go for shopping Lots of souvenirs art n crafts etc for good reasonable price Street food awesome here
11565,4,Quite a quaint place to visit Resturants galore but its not much of a night life place Look to the alleys for hidden gems We chanced upon a nice bbq place in an alley and was very satisfied despite obvious language barriers
11566,4,Insadong is where traditional arts crafts and culture meets tourism You will find some of the same kitch tourist items here that you will find in all the markets however if you are looking for traditional handmade items antiques beautiful traditional watercolour and ink paintings amethyst which Korea is known for and great examples of white and green jade jewellery leatherwork etc then this is the place Great eating spots that are not expensive and walking distance to the 3 main palaces and Jongmyo Shrine and the traditional Hanok Village Take the time and spend the day in the area and have a good look around Dont buy at the first place and check your prices be prepared to walk away if you feel the price is to high If it can be lowered they will call you back If it cannot they wont
11567,4,Whenever you go to InsaDong youll find it crowdy but it comes as no surprise as the street is full of life and things to do art galleries places to eat souvenir shops cafes etc If you want to buy souvenirs this is definitely the right place to go to I recommend having a matcha ice cream at Osulloc and continue your visit in Bukchon Hanok Village located nearby
11568,4,Theres a lot of stuff for sale that probably you dont need Though its crowded its still worth checking out
11569,5,It s like a village with full of small shop Good restaurant  touristic stuffs ancestral writing and painting stuff small bakery and cafe it s a real pleasure to be lost and discover some courtyards and garden Lot of Art Gallery
11570,4,The feeling of walking on the streets of insadong is amazing The streets are on the hill and there are small shops located beside It gives a feeling of Europe
11571,3,This is nice if you really need to buy an authentic souvenir from Korea At walking distance from Myongdong after the river
11572,4,I have been here a number of times over the years and it is still worth a visit Although touristy there are a number of shops still selling interesting arts and crafts The bars are expensive but that is not surprising The feel of the area can also be very nice if you miss the crowds If youre in the area its certainly worth a stroll around
11573,4,A must go Insadong It is a cute little narrow shopping street with small shops on both sides Everything here is related to art and culture Shops sell items like hand painted fans pottery porcelain items clothes bags slippers scarves etc There are small coffee shops and restaurants Street food is plenty Hotteok was an interesting sweet snack made of dough and filled with nuts and coated with sugar and cinnamon There was also Corn cookie which turned out to be a corn based shell with vanilla Icecream They were quite unusual Some people were entertaining the crowds by doing some tricks I would definitely recommend a visit to this happening place
11574,3,Some really beautiful artwork pottery etc in upscale art galleries on Insadong but generally most of the stores were lower end souvenir or clothing Quite a few restaurants around
11575,5,Insadong has lots of souvenir shops You can find t shirts fridge magnet key rings purse scarf chopsticks and so many more They have very clean public toilet at the end of the road So no need to worry to look around there for hours
11576,4,Insadong is the right place if you are searching for souvenirs It has a lot of options to choose from It has many good Michelin rated restaurants and nice tea places as well
11577,4,nice place to shop but it is not that busy during winter loved the 10000won bag shop lots of options at 1 price
11578,4,Definitely visit stroll around get some souvenirs or clothsaccessories or get something to eat Visit during day time Cool vibe cool place
11579,5,After a delayed flight due to mechanical issues in SEA we ended up unable to make our connection at ICN to India and had a bonus day in Seoul on the airline so we took full advantage Insadong was an unexpected pleasure easily navigated even with its plethora of alleyways filled with stores and eateries  As a traveler this area is ripe for the pickin Lots of souvenir trinkets some rather nice plenty of art options lots of restaurants and street food and even a Starbucks if you cant stand to be far from one Best of all for the wayward traveler its an area thats part of the tourist trade many languages are spoken and its just an extremely cool experience Interesting architecture lines the roads and the alleyways filled with those neon signs almost beg you to explore  Being as our time in Seoul was short and we didnt get to explore more of Seoul within our 24 hour time frame limiting us this area really made us want to see more of Korea People were nice food was good whats not to like Well be back for a longer look around next trip through  Ive added some photos with my failing phone camera at the time just to give some idea of the area My apologies for the bad white balance
11580,5,Street selling traditional souvenirs represent South Korea in affordable price traditional handcarved stamp hand fan handmade pouch you name it We can see alot of people walking around in hanbok And dont skip the small alley you can find alot of good food here
11581,4,Shopping is not my thing however there were a few things here that caught my eye The pretty street is a bit of a tourist trap though There were abundant hanbok shops antique shops and many craft shops such as embroidery adorned boxes pottery souvenirs and the ilk It did have several nice looking art galleries which I didnt visit due to time limitations and in one side street a Knives and Sword shop I did however head off the main shopping street to explore the small side streets which I believe is called Ssamzigil These alleys had some amazing and beautiful architecture some of which were cafes and restaurantsThe shopping area didnt open until 10 am and some shops 10301100am I went on a weekday Worth a visit
11582,5,We went there for buying things about South Korea but a bit expensive You can find a lot of souvenir shops in Insadong
11583,5,Really enjoyed walking there with my mother nice small shops and restaurants but we didnt try any of them so I cant write my opinion
11584,3,This is a lively and interesting place to stroll around but dont go there expecting to find any bargains Most of the items on sale seemed to be fairly expensive and not difficult to find elsewhere in the world
11585,4,This is a vibrant shopping area filled with stalls selling arts and crafts and souvenirs There were food stalls in the area as well selling a wide variety of street food There are also heaps of restaurants in the vicinity
11586,5,I loved the feel of Insadong This was my fourth visit to Seoul and I have loved Insadong every visit There is so much to do and you should really take the time to explore all of the little alleyways too Lots of gorgeous little shops selling handicrafts and pottery There is also Ssamjigil which is a great little cluster of quirky shops and a few poop cafes dont judge  they were so adorable It is a really fun place and great for a laugh with friends or kids Or just some really immature adults Ahem 
11587,5,Insadong is a small shopping street filled with souvenir shops and interesting food joints I visited almost all the main shopping areas in Seoul but enjoyed Insadong the most for souvenirs Its also a very nice place to walk around window shopping as well Picked up a few cool souvenirs from National Souvenir Centre where the they spoke english and were more than willing to explain the details of each souvenir
11588,5,Insadong is a mustvisit place whenever I stay in Seoul You can find all kinds of souvenirs from the cheap mass produced items to the unique handcrafted ones Not to mention the wonderful restaurants along the small sidestreets of Insadong
11589,5,In my opinion this is the best market for souvenir shopping There are many unique art shops to buy oneofakind handmadehand painted works I bought a small ceramic oil lamp some paintings and a custom made music box among other things And the prices are very reasonable Its a great place for getting gifts for others too And there are plenty of the cheap mass produced souvenirs around as well Its an easy walk to or from Jogyesa Temple so stop by both
11590,5,This was a place I like with lots and lots of things to do and see and feel and taste and eatyou would need a couple of days or more just to be able to see all the interesting places and shops to visit But what I like the most is the side streets where actually locals eat and chillyoud need to visit to be able to understand the fathoms of this area a more cheaper area than Myeondonggil aswell
11591,5,I loved this place You really get to see the culture flourish in the market area the old and the new compliment each other We were able to spend two hours in this area shopping eating and marveling over the styles and culture of South Korea I wish we had more time Try the dragon breathe dessert Its amazing corn starch and honey mixed and stretched over and over to get this mouthwatering treat Id go back in a heartbeat
11592,4,One thing I like about this place is that its near the palaces and its not so crowded plus it has a public toilet hehehe Street food is a bit cheaper in Myeongdong as well and uf you want to buy some souvenir this is the place to be
11593,4,Its a lovely place to get art and craft items for souvenirs I got handcrafted hanbok cards and magnetic memo pegs for gifts at reasonable prices Just browse at the shops along the Main Street We also visited the Poop cafe on the top floor of Samsziegiel and enjoyed the novelty of it
11594,5,It was an interesting and pretty street full of shops The lanes were also very pretty with restaurants and more shops Insadong didnt necessarily sell cosmetics but other things too along with interesting and local street food Its a must visit in Seoul
11595,4,This place was packed at the weekend However it was lots of fun looking at the shops and street food stalls Its definitely catered for the tourists however its a fascinating place to be Especially seeing all the traditional dress shops
11596,5,Great little spot with shops restaurants history and culture With the family  two kids included  this pleased all of us
11597,5,Insadong is amazing Full of small streets full of reataurants and tea houses Highly recommended
11598,4,The famous street is really nice a lot of shops restaurants and Cafes but soooo touristic Its nice to see You should go there
11599,5,Insadong is the premier arts and craft stop in Seoul It combines just the right mixture of old shops modern art gallery museums and lots of coffee shops and eateries to make an afternoon of browsing shopping and eating out a whole lot of fun But be aware This area is also popular with the locals  so if you come out for a Saturday or Sunday you may be dealing with more people than you bargained for
11600,5,I love the street so much Its so relaxing walking there with a lot of antique shops around The street is not that busy and peak as Myeongdong and other shopping street
11601,4,Several art galleries alongside shops for tourists cafes and restaursnts make this place ideal for tourists Tip dont miss the jogyesa Buddhist temple nearby
11602,4,Visited on a Saturday and it is full swing with people Lots of locals and tourist A lot of shops and unique crafts Not to mention lots of cafes from the beginning till end  So if you are tired from all the walking you can stop at any cafes to recharge The little alleys at the side has some restaurants and cafes that youmight want to explore  Exit 6 from Anguk station walk towards your left away from the police station towards the tourist information centre and you will be at Insadong
11603,5,I always love going to insadong area I love the unique shops and souvenirs I also ate at one of the back alley restaurants I had bibimbap Highly recommend for shopping and souvenirs
11604,3,Not many things to see here unless you are preparing for buying lots of stuff here Im no a very fan of this place and I recommend to visit here if you happens to have more time in Seoul
11605,3,Insadong is another shopping district with lots of small back alleys Its more of a traditional market with lots of souvenir shops and some art places The smaller alleys also got a lot of local restaurant Dont plan to spend several hours here and do go before lunch time  I recommend combining this with Gyeongbokgung Palace Bukchok Hanok Village Changdeokgung Palass
11606,5,Pls note I Came here and by coincidence there was a street festival on hence the 5 stars otherwise 354 max   Very artsy area  was packed due to a multicultural street festival on with performances and street stalls In general its a bit of a tourist trap area and stores selling hipster goods and trinkets If it wasnt for the street festival may only need 15 hours here
11607,5,Theres always locals dressed in hanboks tourist souvenirs and street food I loved the couplelike alley located on the 3rd floor this is similar to Namsan Tower
11608,4,This is a fun area to poke around in the little shops and to get a bite to eat or drink Lots of little mom and pop places with friendly proprietors This isnt fancy but thats what makes it laid back and enjoyable
11609,4,Insadong offers almost everything you would want to see feel and taste as a tourist in Seoul within 10 minutes of walking  Yes the area is somewhat pricy but thats just how tourist areas are in general Thst does not mean that the quality of things to do is bad Its easy to sort out the good stuff from the bad  Dont forget to walk the alleyways you might find something surprisingly good
11610,4,I had higher hopes of Insadong with narrow old street and shops that caters to its past The only place we enjoyed were the mask store made in the store by the owner himself but the rest were mostly designed for tourists However go check out the side streets where one will find amazing restaurants serving local food
11611,3,if you are going to pick up knick knacks to take home  or art work  this is the place Items are likely to be overpriced  but you will have fun shopping
11612,5,I visited as part of a tour the Saturday before Thanksgiving week so things were busy There was an interesting blend of very exclusive shops  high end and very beautiful celadon for instance  and cheap and cheerful Quote touristy but definitely worth it with some lovely eating places
11613,3,I understand this place is famous for buying souvenirs We walked passed here while on our way back to our hotel We did not buy anything because nothing really catch our attention here
11614,5,This a delightful place for people who like to shop in small stores in a market atmosphere Lots of reasonable priced colorful clothes and hats for women Tons of souvenirs Lovely restaurants hidden in alleyways And there is a special Free Market which is a structure of at least 4 levels of tiny craft shops some of which sell the most delightfully designed crafts scarves jewelry ornaments etc A mixture of old and state of the art in craftsAnd I actually found a vegan restaurant in one of the alleys
11615,5,Even as someone who lives in Seoul I always love coming here with guests So many fun shops great places to eat and fun things to see The street is quite quaint despite being in the busy city no cars drive down this area and you can find all the perfect gifts to take back home with you And the calligraphy shops Dont even get me started 
11616,5,Clustered along one street is a good cross section of higher quality souvenir shops and small artists and craftsmen displaying original pieces and custom fashions This was our favorite place for small and big purchases that were useful beautiful and will remind us for Korea for a long time
11617,5,Interesting tourist street with lots of small shops and street stalls Good place to get bargains and please do bargain Souvenirs cosmetics and clothing shops aplenty  Aside from the usual touristy shopping there is some sightseeing to do here There is a grand Buddhist temple nearby thats worth a visit
11618,1,The worst shopping experience I have had in the Far East  One shop after another selling overpriced tat
11619,4,We stayed in Insadong and found it most interesting and accessible If only wed had more time to try more of the eateries I would definitely stay here on my next visit
11620,4,We spent an hour here  nice place for a walk few galleries to see and also good place to buy souvenirs
11621,4,Not much more to be said than has already been written Excellent mix of tourist trap and unique boutique Great place to buy souvenirs for home and check out contemporary painters
11622,5,The whole street is packed with stores galleries and restaurants that will amaze you especially if you love their traditional artcrafts This is the place where you can buy small presents to bring home which is more cheaper than other places since you buy by bulk Make sure to visit every shop sonce most of them sell different and unique pieces
11623,4,Ate at two good restaurants in this area on two different days Also a good place for shopping This is a good place to visit in between visiting the two palaces
11624,4,Its a nice and interesting street to visit Take your time You can see many antique art and book stores traditional teahouses and craft shops
11625,5,We were staying at Isadong We walked around the Insadonggil which is a traditional  old street that combined the past and the present It has a mixture of historical and modern atmosphere and is an unique area of Seoul The majority of the buildings on the street are shops or of commercial use The area is well known for sightseeing theres a street market on the weekend and it is filled with local and overseas visitors The area also has a lot of old antique shops and art galleries as well as traditional stationery shops Im particular intrigued by the calligraphy shoes and stone stamps
11626,4,Nice place for local and chic shopping Love the lovely mall Nice Bibimbab underground Cute cupcake with Poo styles
11627,4,This is a famous street at Seoul which very well known as a shopping street for tourist Here we can see so many store sell for souvenir and other stuff but a bit pricy because this is a tourist attraction Very nice street to visit and enjoy the atmosphere
11628,4,I like the atmosphere here Many souvenir shops although it is not cheap cafe that offer delicious desserts cat cafe alive museum etc This is absolutely a tourist area I think all travellers should go to this place just to enjoy the atmosphere here
11629,4,We had a long layover at Incheon and decided to take the Arex into Seoul Station Once there we asked the English information person about where we should go being we only had 34 hrs of time She suggested Insadong We didnt know any better so took her word for it and a few stops on the subway later we were there Insadong is easy to get to and easy to find once out of the station We found it somewhat interesting and cheesy at the same time There were a lot of tourist shops but far more expensive than Myeondong or such as they seem to directly target tourist I twas a fun and safe and somewhat hygienic stroll but lacked authentic character They did have some interesting shops for knives and sort and we did buy a few things The best memory was of a European guy selling ice cream on the street that was part circus act and part comedian The ice cream was delicious it was July and the performance getting you the ice cream was even better Hard to describe but if he is there selling ice creamgelato buy it even if you arent hungry for it You will become part of the show and is definitely video worthy
11630,5,This area has everything for younger adults to shop drink eat and just hang out There are carts and shops for everyone and even dogs Even dogs can shop for little outfits here Anyone up for coffee Well you will find a Starbucks or coffee shop and a French bakery approximately every 50 km If you are looking to get your nails done you will need to look up to the 2nd or 3rd floors of the buildings to find thingsservices you may need
11631,4,Interesting district Lots of drinking 10000 all you can drink in an hour Street could be anywhere in world Food good but not cheap
11632,4,This is suppose to be the traditional temple area Right now the streets seemed to be kinda closed and very few cars drive down the road There are some clothing shops but a lot of stalls and restaurants There are loads of side streets which then have real treasures in terms of restaurants etc So its a great place to spend the evening
11633,4,Lots of small shops restaurants and coffee shops Just fun to stroll and look even in a Seoul monsoon downpour Enjoyed it
11634,5,Is you are interested with local artisan custom jewelry this is a good place to look for one Price range depends on the material like brass to gold
11635,5,If you are looking to get away from the over commercialized area of Myeongdong than head to Insadong While youll still find some of the cheap tourist souvenirs you can find more unique hand crafted items in Insadong On my last night in Seoul I was wandering the area and spotted a gorgeous hand painted sign It was small about 4x 12 and a bargain at 10000 won The artist himself was there to show me other similar paintings he had It was a neat experience and added sentimental value to my purchase
11636,5,Cute little neighborhood for strolling and people watching Lots of cute shops Many shops selling calligraphy brush and ink sticks Theres a cat cafe too Lots of street food vendors 
11637,2,There are some cool areas of Insadong where locals set up shop to sell their handmade goods and local musicans busk; however most of the area though is covered in those shops that sell massproduced products made from China where every shop decides to sell the exact same items I would not recommend eating in the area unless you read a good review about it as well as some shops are tourist pricing type shops  I would say Insadong area is where many of the older generation locals live Youll notice that quite early in walking around in the area outside of the main strip  If you are planning to go to Gyeongbokgung palace or Changdeokgung palace they you owe yourself to check the area out as it is extremely close
11638,1,Dont waste your time here if you are shopping for quality goods There may be a couple of good stores but finding them among the morass of cheap shops is a battle I wouldnt trust buying anything here as likely much of it could be made in China No good restaurants that we saw just more of the same junky shops block after block Not worth the cab ride to get there
11639,4,We visited Insadong twice once in the morning and another in the evening I would suggest to visit the place in the evening as there are more shops open From my observation most shops in Seoul open late Its a more relaxed shopping area with less people compared to Myeongdong or Namdaemun Youll see more tradional shops in Insadong They sell traditional food and fashion Comparing the price here and other shopping areas items here are more expensive Nonetheless it was a good experience
11640,5,This neighborhood is worth walking around Lots of local ceramic  art shops trendy coffee  tea shops
11641,5,My interests lie more in the culturalhistorical side so this was a really wonderful place to visit I wish I had set aside more shopping money for Insadong The handicrafts and souvenirs are beautiful and unique though a little on the pricy side It would be good to compare prices because some stores sell the same type of souvenirs at different prices  The traditional teahouses mostly open at 11am do take note if youre going in the morning Definitely recommended to try it out the cultural experience and gastronomical delight is worth the price
11642,3,Another tourist attraction Lots of local designer wares and art design pieces can be found here You can also visit Ssamzeigeil where its a 4 stories openair mall with interesting layout and shops  If you get tired from walking duck into any of the many coffee houses there to rest have a nice cool drink and simply people watch
11643,4,Other stuff which are not mostly found in Myeongdong or other near university shops can be found here What I loved are the calligraphy brushes handmade cases fans etc If you really want something authentic and handmade then you should go here 
11644,5,I just know I hadnt enough time to spend here Streets are so nice with very great and warming coffee places As a shopper I have to say the options are just too many it was great
11645,5,The alleys are adorable and there are cute places to eat drink and shop All souvenir wishes will be fulfilled here Be sure to check out the kimchi museum  its a bit hard to find and be sure to try the samples in the small fridge they are also hard to find
11646,5,This trip I had one morning and part of an afternoon free and decided to stroll into Insadong The last time I went for a delicious dinner at a very busy bbq restaurant The atmosphere was busy but so like local Seoul This time I was not disappointed There were so many things to see handpainted fans paintings by locals craft works and of course shopping The opening price is much cheaper than Myeongdong so there is almost no need to bargain but they will give you some discount if you insist We came across a lovely beef broth noodle soup place  mainly locals they did not speak English and thats where I am headed when I go back again Time flew by too fast and I would recommend at least 45 hours if you include lunch and tea in the many quaint shops You need to stop and stay still and feel the pulse of Insadong If youre in a hurry all you will see are shops and more shops
11647,3,Insadong is fun to go to with friends  but just for a very short while There is nothing much to see  some coffee shops  tourist trap like many other mentioned  overpriced clothes  cheapfake souvenirs But still it has its charm to me There are also if I remember correctly 2 vegetarian restaurants And one of the best healthy and vegetarian bibimbap
11648,2,I really wish this area was more charming and had more character Sadly its now a pure tourist trap Please take a short walk up north of Insadong to Samcheongdong where smaller boutiques back alleys and art galleries are Samcheongdong is also getting more mainstreambig stores but its still better than Insadong
11649,4,Just took a stroll on the Insa Dong street and thoroughly enjoyed shop hopping Nice place for well priced local souvenirs Also has some fantastic restaurants Very close to Anguk Metro station A good place to start feeling The city through street shopping
11650,4,a place to get souvenirs at a cheap price found unique souvenirs here too many eateries and cafes in the area can also walk to bukchon hanok village after exploring here
11651,4,was trying to hold myself dearly from buying all those awesome art n crafts product ssamjigil was interesting bought some potteries as an atypical souvenir from korea if u love handmade fancy paper this is the place to shop til u drop
11652,5,A friend and I spent the day just hopping from tea house to tea house eating little snacks along the way It couldnt have been a more enjoyable day of delicious tea and exploring
11653,4,We only walked the main street and it was filled with souvenirs shop calligraphy shop and street vendors selling snacks Some interesting things here are the name stamps shop the snack shops tucked in alleys and some people going around in hanbok There are some tea houses too selling the famous patbingsoo dessert and tea 
11654,4,It is a tourist area with small shops selling local souvenirs along the pave way There is a complex with winding stairs and a wishing card bridge on its top There are quite a few interesting shops in the complex which worth visiting There are quite a lot restaurants behind the pedestrian main street serving typical Korea set menu Had some drink in the Jeju tea shop which is just fine
11655,3,The ssamziegil shops is a MUSTGO if u visit insadong Could feel the culture of Korea via the handmade ceramics and antique shops worth for a visit
11656,3,Walked to Insadong after visiting Gyeongbokgung We were disappointed as the street was mostly souvenir shops and didnt feel authentic
11657,4,This place is very hip and happening Filled with all kinds of interesting shops food clothes accessories Good place to hang out
11658,4,This is a great shopping dining and sightseeing area Its close to other attractions and sights so its good for lunch during a day of sightseeing
11659,4,This neighborhood was very fun and I recommend you visit while in Seoul When we went it was snowing pretty badly and that kinda sucked but the shops were still open We visited a museum and some galleries there and that was cool because we were indoors After the galleries and the museum it had stopped snowing and all the shops were open and it was very pleasant The souvenirs were the cheapest I found and you can haggle the prices here If you have time visit Insa Dong since it is very near bus stops and the Metro
11660,5,A must in your trip You can look for great cheap finds I bought here my paintings traditional masks give aways bell sculptures and cheap cosmetics Then rest in one of the cute cafe along this street
11661,5,You can get lovely tea here Ossuloc and their tea room is gorgeous; you get a little match cookie with your tea and a timer to tell you when the leaves have sufficiently steeped There are some pretty shops with hand made mother of pearl and lacquer boxes which open up to reveal little drawers for jewellery They also sell little keyrings bookmarks and embroidered cushions Nice for souvenirs Korea is famous for amethyst and you can also get lovely geodes and crystals here
11662,2,I didnt find much to be impressed about here Definitely more stalls selling souvenirappropriate items but there are usually cheaper alternatives elsewhere Visit only if you are not done with your souvenir shopping and have a strong interest in traditional arts and crafts
11663,5,Since Insadong is just around Bukchon Gyeongbokgung palace and Changdeokgung palace who might want to stroll and shop around the area where you can buy South Koreas best souvenirs You can find colorful silk pouches key chains nail cutters joseon king and queen bookmarks hanbok stickers embroideries authentic paintings tea sets charms colorful painted fans Hanbok sets and a lot more
11664,3,Plenty of local handicrafts and potteries I checked a few items but found the prices to be on the higher side so did not buy much here But good street to explore as a tourist
11665,5,Its like Myeongdong but more on the affordable side Insadong has a lot of galleries where local artist can exhibit their artworks Also coffee shop is everywhere and you can buy a lot of cheap souvenirs here
11666,5,For me Insadong is the best place to shop in Seoul if you are looking for antiques pottery or good quality souvenirs I love the look and feel and while it is quite touristic is keeps an aura of authenticity
11667,5,Insadong is one of my favorite places in Seoul There is a shop for just about everything and the food carts and stalls offer delicious options that you can eat as you are walking You can find handmade items clothing souvenirs pretty much anything you can think of  Just a tip thoughif you buy food that has a container or wrapper youll be carrying it around until you go back to your hotel or to the train There are no garbage cans anywhere
11668,4,This is a great area to explore quite arty and a good walking street with some lovely old style wooden type restaurants hidden up alley ways
11669,5,Good for a walk souvenir shopping along with nice cafe food and restaurant within walking distance with major attraction in Seoul
11670,4,I would recommend you do your research before visiting Insadong Go online and look for a walking tour for example Or follow walking directions from a tour book Otherwise you will be walking among many other tourists looking at nothing but overpriced souvenir shops There are many beautiful buildings alleys and historical places to be seen here but without prior preparations these might be hard to find So do come prepared unless of course you like souvenir shopping 
11671,4,insadong is easily walkable from changdeokgung gyeongbukgong and bukchon hanok village a district that sells lots of traditional souvenirs and a place where you see people walking around in hanboks its a nice sight  I personally feel that the traditional souvenirs are a little expensive though but its worth a visit if you like culture food and art
11672,4,Did not spend a lot of time there but that 1 hour was nice as you ca find a lot of culture stuffs but DO NOT buy just google for the items and you can get the same item for lesser price
11673,5,Try on the hanbok for a fee of 3000 won  tourist information centre Closing  530pm local time Bring your own camera
11674,4,Along this street there are lots of arts and culture goods for souvenirs mostly handmade Interesting and creative place At the top floor of Ssamziegil shops you will find love locks and love notes for wishes and photo taking
11675,3,Walked a little but didnt enjoyed the shops too many jewelry selling gold and some old watches Lots of restaurants too There are better areas in Seoul for tourist shopping
11676,5,This place is nothing short than amazing Many cute little shops selling handmade stuff great food locals hanging out I loved it
11677,3,Shops on both sides of a street meant for casual strolling Can buy local souvenirs here Quite nice but nothing memorable
11678,4,Was just a street with shops by the side of the road with tourist stuff and cultural stuff Some shops are interesting some you will just walk pass  Nothing to scream about actually but where since I was in Korea mind as well complete it
11679,4,A very cultural street filled with traditional and modern arts lots of street food as well Some great restaurants too
11680,5,PROS Not that touristy compared to Myeongdong A lot of beautiful and cheap shops present You can bargain too Close to city center and Palaces  CONS Noisy Turkish Ice Cream Seller Shut up Dude  LOCATION 55 PRICE 55 HOSPITALITY 45 ATTRACTIONS 45
11681,4,Even with obvious tchotcke shops if your style of shopping has nothing to do with ginormous malls this place is for you Though you wont find bargains per se you can find lots of beautiful handcrafted and unusual things for yourself and friends who deserve something unique Theres also 2Cats Cafe with lovely owners and some street food
11682,5,Really like this place as with traditional architecture but combining with cool new fashionable small shops Not big brands nor luxury brands just local small neighborhood stores And it is not busy and super noisy area very nice esp around 103012noon
11683,5,The scents sights shopping people watching art culture architecture down to the stone lined streets take you to a place that was much closer to what Seoul was like before the miracle on the Han
11684,5,Been to Seoul twice and I went back to InsaDong a number of times during each trip I just LOVE this place You can buy souvenirs for almost everyone in your family or friends here Great restaurants too One restaurant that I went back to on my second trip is Gogung which is located at the basement of Ssamziegil a shopping center located in InsaDong Explore the shops and galleries Dont get disheartened if you dont get bargains or deals on your first shop Theres always one shop that would be more than willing to do business with you and show you enough patience 
11685,5,Charming area with a lot of character some cobblestone walks Plenty of pretty pots and plants Many many shopswith generally the same merchandise but it is of quality Restaurants tucked away on side streets and a few tea houses too Very clean You can spend hours here like we did All good
11686,5,You will find lovely 34 stars hotels in this neighbourhood Best location to visit the palaces shrines and temples Plenty of small shops selling souvenirs Easy access by two metro stations and airport bus Not to mention the local restaurants offering delicious food day and night Good also for art and galeries
11687,4,We reached the area late and many places were actually getting ready to close but from what was still in operation the shops focus on handicraft and the arts such as painting etc Definitely worth a visit
11688,5,My favourite part of Seoul Always changing yet always vibrant Lots to see eat and buy there so drop in and have a stroll around
11689,4,Lots of little shops but many sell the same things Wide range of goods on offer from quality art to tacky souvenirs often made in China Plenty of street food available and little side alleys with tea rooms add to the interest We ended up going 3 times because the prices were good and the atmosphere was lovely Suggest you take Metro to Anguk then walk down one side of street and back up the other Also within easy walking distance of the main palaces Although pedestrianized keep a look out for mopeds and scooters that seem to be allowed to go anywhere
11690,5,And have some fun as well Very tourist friendly but not tacky Nice food options from street food to international restaurants Lots of back alleys and nooks to get into Nice shops but this is where you can pick up a bunch of inexpensive souvenirs for the suitcase and nephews nieces back home And really central to lots of activities So if you like walking  this is an easy place to start or end your day  as you take in the surrounding environment
11691,3,you will have to go to the side streets for the more local experience i found the main street quire boring but probably because i am interested in the malls and the hyper markets rather than independant stores
11692,4,Insadong lacks the oomph of certain other neighborhoods and attractions in Seoul Still there are all kinds of shops here offering a variety of products that range from the authentic and artisanal to the kitschy and cheesy  Its worth a pleasant hour or two just strolling through peoplewatching and windowshopping Also the Starbucks at one end was at least at one point the only Starbucks in the world to use the local alphabet for its signage rather than STARBUCKS in honor of this traditional neighborhood  Recommended
11693,5,My friends and I had a lot of fun browsing through the stores and taking pictures in different corners Insadong has lots of stores and galleries So dont miss the ones up the stairs or down in basements They are definitely worth visiting
11694,4,This was right next to our hotel so a great place to walk to at night lots of people and stalls and atmosphere Felt very safe
11695,5,I managed to get beautiful embroidery here with good bargain price And a lot of options that we can find here from the cheapest to the most expensive ones
11696,5,Filled up with foreigners this place too is a good shopping street Items that can be found Souvenirs abundant bags leather clothing food etc Recommend There is some kind of a oval shaped fried bun with sweet filling  its a must try there easy to spot as u ll have a long queue The multistoreyed building with no stepsfigure it out Wooden utensils  utilities are good if you are interested
11697,4,Good place to stroll and shop for artsy and cute local stuff This was were I bought souvenir items and gifts for my friends This was also were I had my photos taken wearing gisaengs and princess costume This area is lively and lovely
11698,5,It was interesting and a bit more quiet lots of artsy stuff here Worth a quick visit We liked the cafes here and there was a tourist information not to far away from the metro station
11699,5,this place just straight a headmany souvenier storenot very excited just walking from the the start till the end of the market there is nothing special
11700,5,Its a pretty short street of gift shops along both sides of the street Do take time to visit the little alleys which may not be that visible on the main streets You could discover nice restaurants or tea house However the tea houses sell tea only and nil snacks So be prepared to ask upfront for what you want and the price to the owners who do not speak much English
11701,5,I liked Insadong a lot Lots of different types of shops selling souvenirs earthenware crafts painting and calligraphy supplies restaurants and coffee shops There was a great buzz to the place even on a wet Sunday and when it wasnt raining there were buskers and someone doing calligraphy with an appreciative crowd round him Closeby is the Jongyo Shrine so it isnt all just shopping
11702,5,Nice little are right in the middle of Seoul We stayed in a hotel there and enjoyed that we could walk through Insadong especially at night as there are very good restaurants Close by the metro and the famous Cheonggyecheon river walk
11703,5,Had a beautiful spring day in Seoul and went to Insadong to explore shops and just enjoy a pedestrian mall setting Very nice shops with unique clothes and art and art supplies Lots of charming restaurants and coffee shops and street vendors Highly recommend a vist
11704,4,This place deserves a short walk I like it that you can soak into the atmosphere and browse through the shops without getting harassed by shopkeepers as you would definitely meet in Namdaemun Market or Myeongdong  Best of all most of the itemsgifts have standard price throughout Korea Maybe im the type who dont like to bargain but I think this system gives me an ease of mind when i purchase gifts This is a good place to buy souvenirs than compared to Namdaemun for sure
11705,4,Usually when you go to a country to visit these places they have dozens of identical stores in which youre expected to just choose the one you think you can bargain down the most or whatever  With the Insadong area there was a bit of that but there was enough variation that you can walk down it and see something new the whole way  To enhance this its not just there for shopping traditional stuff Its littered with art galleries more so than you might think There are some big ones  one in particular has 56 floors of exhibitions  but there are dozens of hidden ones in basements barely signposted You can be there for hours just spending 5 minutes in each one  If you dont like art then whatever Still got good cafes free wifi access down the whole street and walking distance to other stuff like Gwanghwamun
11706,5,An old area of Seoul that is worth the visit Lovely little alley ways and winding streets A great variety of shops and street markets Allow plenty of time to wander
11707,4,Our hotel Centre Mark  was 1 minutes walk from here magic Areal funky place  bars food great little shops and other interesting little places its great just to lay back and cruise the zone interesting as anything  the locals are very friendly and everyones happy no traffic and no packed crowds love it
11708,4,Insadong is largely overpriced and touristy full of nonSeoulites and gift shops sometimes overcrowded and full of kitschy stalls On the other hand amongst the gift shops in gallerys clothes there are actual very interesting galleries And Insadong has superb traditional art supply stores They are a bit pricy of course but they have a variety and a knowledge about their products you cant find elsewhere If you look hard enough you can find an actual traditional hanji store 
11709,5,If you walk in the alleyways youll find plenty of teahouses One in particular Shin Old TeaHouse is a superb place to visit Located at the end of an alleyway beside the OSulluc this place is small peaceful and tranquil They offer some interesting teas too Worth getting lost for
11710,5,Better than the markets and with more life than any other place we got lost here many many times during our stay and every experience was different Wed recommend basing yourself around here  couldnt be more central and all Seoul is in these streets
11711,5,This place is near where we stayed in Korea and we used to stroll there every evening The food are very affordable and you can take it while walking along the streets Lights at night are so beautiful
11712,5,As our hotel was located nearby we took strolls every evening to eat street food The streets are not as busy as Myongdong but were very interesting especially during the weekend
11713,4,Love coming to this place An interesting place to raom around With many interesting foodies and shops and pubs
11714,4,Theres lots of shopping choices though expensive Its also where you buy your ticket to Nami Island and take the bus from there too We loved the authentic beef barbeque restaurants which used fresh beef not the marinated version you get in touristy places and overseas
11715,5,The best place to shop for souvenir even some people might say Namdaemun offers cheaper price but I love Insadong more
11716,4,A great place to come to after visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace or the nearby Bukchon Hanok Village  Good food traditional restaurants and teahouses shops and galleries mostly arty stuff One special thing about the shops in this area  their shop signs are all written in hangeul even Starbucks  Check out Ssamziegil too
11717,4,A place which sells many traditional souvenirs and also famous for tea Famous tea shop osullo is extremely congested n requires reservation before going Make sure to book before going
11718,5,Is a short one lane shopping place but fills with modern and traditional items Dont just look shop on ground floor try to explore those basement or 1F  2F shops and cafes Start from Jonggak Station Subway Line 1 Exit 3 walk 250 meter then turn left at the intersection Or start from Anguk Station Subway Line 3 Exit 6 walk 100 meter till Tourist Information Booth and turn left
11719,5,Shopping district with plenty of small gift shops and restaurants Worth to visit day and late evening
11720,3,I strolled through this district many times during my 2 week trip to Seoul There are some very interesting shops with ceramics and artwork but they are surrounded by many shops with cheap merchandise so it takes some effort if you are doing serious shopping There are endless kiosks of street food Most of it fried dough stuffed w meat My colleague at snow without problems There are many restaurants on the side alleys We picked one that was disappointing I suggest picking restaurant that dont offer an English menu to get more authentic local food
11721,5,a lot of nice cafes and traditional tea houses one of the must go place during your trip i have spent almost half day here to enjoy one of the traditional tea house MUST try the honey biscuit with the tea
11722,4,One of the mustgo places in Seoul so I went and I liked it There were some very interesting masks and foods to try as well as a multi level shopping area The only thing was that it was very touristy and felt like the whole thing was just catered to tourists Although fun to visit it can be a little disappointing in some ways
11723,5,Great place for souvenirs There is nice mall towards the middle that has a cute couples place at the top At the end of the street there are great and tasty food carts
11724,4,There are lots of shops that sell arts and crafts besides souvenirs be it modern or traditional I spent about 3 hours there and it was far than enough I only got to go to a few shops but I bought the most here in Insadong compared to other places  One particular thing I like about Insadong is the small alleys This is where rows of small restaurants and eateries that cater to the locals working around Insadong but yes they do serve foreigners as well if you dont mind communicating in different languages with the ahjummas shoptenders
11725,5,Great shopping area to get a more traditional Korea shopping experience Nice nicnacs and souvenirs are here lots of crafts Good place to people watch and close to Changdeokgung and Jogyesa
11726,5,This is a street with multiple side streets that all sell handicrafts Came here first as part of a day tour but returned on my own after 5 hours at one of the palaces Great combo for a full day
11727,5,You can find all souvenirs for families here Broad range of choices from traditional to modern souvenirs For unique mall experience try Ssamziegil this unique mall was designed in such a way by connecting its charming alleys in the form of a spirallike stairway The alleys are decorated with murals
11728,4,Insadong is flooded with cafes and some diners The retail shops there are fancier more to the higherend but really limited choices I went there just to sit by the window of a cafe enjoying a cup of hot coffee and admiring the architectures Snapping a few pics too Insadong is the lower part of Bukchon Hanok Village Therefore you can see the beautiful structures of hanoks climbing high up the mountain
11729,3,ok this is that part of town that exists in every city There are dozens of stores all selling the same handmade crafts usually at prices higher than anywhere else The whole area is really about 3 blocks long and it does have all your requisite touristy things to buy There are also a lot of street food vendors and restaurants
11730,4,Insadong is a very nice area with a lot of great food and shops If you are a foodie like me then you will love it It had cakes in the shape off poo stuffed with red bean Rice cakes with organic honey green tea ice cram and a lot of other delicious foods There are also a few shops around there
11731,5,This is a nice street on which to stroll with handicraft and antique shops as well as many eateries
11732,4,at Insadong you can buy plenty of souvenirs for good prices but dont miss the Garden tea house they offer amazing tea full of flavor a heaven for tea lovers
11733,4,This street is popular safe a bit touristy but interesting I would recommend a couple passes through during your time in Seoul The restaurants offer lots of the musttry dishes of Korea and there are a scattering of traditional shops with seals brushes and carvings that are more interesting sights than the imported Chinese bags and Korea magnets Lots of smells to smell
11734,5,So this is where you are going to find any tourists in town Its a great street filled with all manner of small shops selling local crafts and souvenirs There are also a number of art and craft boutiques to visit which are worth the trip
11735,5,I recommend this place for souvenirs shopping Surrounded by good restaurants unique shopping and nice coffee shop to spent your lovely afternoon
11736,3,One advise Do not visit this place during summer in the noon The hotness is unbearable Sweating like crazy However this place has many things you can buy to bring home for your loved one The price is medium I think since ive tried namdaemun and its not really that much different
11737,4,Insadong is the place to shop in Seoul if you want antiques and highfashion goods Accordingly it is pricier than Namdaemoon or Itaewon But you will find quality trendy goods here that you likely will not find in the other two places
11738,5,Practically I recommend this place for souvenirs shopping Thumbs up  Plus it is near my hotel too we just walked there to shop Really miss this place
11739,5,Lots of great street food vendors cute souvenirs and really good restaurants Wear comfortable shoes as you will be walking a lot and parts of the street are cobblestone
11740,5,Love it good restaurants unique shopping all blended in traditional and current day Korea Gorgeous during the summer late spring and early fall
11741,4,The area is more upscale than the likes of Itaewon The restaurants seemed new and there is an emphasis on art and culture in the shops Pleasant atmosphere
11742,4,I really love Insadong It gives a different vibes compared to Myeongdong or Itaewon as there are unique feels to it When I went there there are a lot of art exhibition and buskers on the streets If I went to Seoul I would definitely go to Insadong again
11743,3,Do you want tchotchkes to take home to your family as proof that you went to Korea Here is one of many places that you can go to to do that I on the other hand dont like those things I dont have a trophy case full of items from places Ive visited I would normally have steered clear of this but our tour guide brought us here because most tourists like shopping at these types of venues No thanks
11744,5,A great street market I ate so much street food and bought a few souvenirs Just thinking about it makes me hungry for more of the street food Korea is filled with street markets though and I think this one had the most food available
11745,5,Funky district of seoul with great street food and arts scene The live museum is not to be missed get in the picture Good shopping for pottery and fun gifts for back home
11746,5,This is the perfect place to hang out if you have a stop over of few hours in Seoul Artworks gifts food architecture everything in one place Just take the subway There is a main street full of stores and restaurants but you should try also the narrow alleys for real local food Prices are totally affordable and there are tourist officers to guide you Not all people speak English but finally you can get what you want with some gestures
11747,4,Really cool souvenirs and presents to buy Theres always a street performance and tons of art galleries The food at the restaurants is incredible
11748,4,this market was not one of my favourites The array of food stall and options was not as big as I had expected and the souvenir stores are overpriced and the uncomfortable to be in because of sales people breathing down your neck It does stand out and offer more traditional shops and tea houses which is pretty cool
11749,4,A tourist spotgreat for a walk around with plenty of restaurants Currency exchange rate is much more better than airport Was there 3192014
11750,3,insadong maybe is known as a sovenir market but the goods here cannot be said cheaper then anywhere else and neither can you bargainover to myeong dong  dongdaemun or namdaemun for the sovenir shopping purpose
11751,4,If you want tradition visit Insadong You will see different shops selling traditional items and souvenirs And if you are an artists visit this place A must if you want to know more about Koreas tradition and culture This is very near to Gyeongbokgung palace and Gwangjang market
11752,5,This expat center is a little pricey However we found some of the best restaurants while there There is a lawyer themed restaurant and a tex mex restaurant where the food is amazing
11753,4,I bought some great art there and souveniors They were probably more expensive than other places but it was close to where I stayed Ssamziegil is fun and you can send a free photo ecard to your friends or get a photo in traditional clothes for a fee
11754,4,We got there quite easily on the subway There is heaps of things specifically designed for tourists so if you want something authentic then this is not the shopping for you Saying that though we picked up some great things ad quite reasonably priced too
11755,5,I really enjoyed the market street Heaps of arts and crafts We ended up buying a beautiful hand painted art scroll from a little store in Insadong Come here for souvenirs however be a bit careful when it comes to eating out It is quite expensive in the larger restaurants That being said there was a fantastic dumpling restaurant tucked away on a side street which was amazing  There is a very helpful tourist information centre located at the start of the street They give you a map to the Hanok village and the palaces
11756,5,We ended up in Insadong so many times during our wonderful stay in Seoul as it is the geographic and indeed cultural intersection of so much of the city Wonderful tea in a tea salon lots of looking and shopping possibilities which kept us occupied and a longawaited opportunity to try out the doctor fish pedicure that was ticklish and fun
11757,5,Insadong is a must to go if you are tourist since you can find a lot of souvenir shops along the street A tourist information center is also located at the area to provide you a specific map of the whole area with shop and street names which i find very helpful to tourists
11758,5,Walking distance from the Buchon Hanok Village Lots of small interesting and artsy shops and narrow alleys Take time to explore the place Come here for souvenirs and street food Must try would be the dragon beard candy double cone icecream dumplings and bean curd If you are lucky you can catch some traditional performances at the stage area near the entrance of the street
11759,4,Love this place Its very long alley with souvenir shops Not just selling cheap souvenirs but also authentic things such as caligraphs potteries and even hanbok Really enjoy visiting this place while shopping souvenirs for people back home It has also a tourist center if u need anything Really recommended
11760,4,This is probably the best and most famous part of Seoul for tourists to come to relax and enjoy a stroll or some shopping The area is filled with small restaurants cafes picturesque allies and lovely little shops The main street in the quarter is almost constantly crowded with people stalls street performers and demonstrators for numerous causes Make sure to visit the area both during the day and after dark as it looks totally different in the evening and has a very young and hip vibe to it
11761,4,We went there on a Sat afternoon and the place was very lively and crowded It is a a very nice area to stroll around and to admire the handicraft products sold here However they are not cheap The buildings here are more traditional so you get a more authentic feel of Seoul compared to the metropolitan shopping districts like Myeongdong which I loved too for different reasons  We love what this area has to offer  unique souvenir products interesting street food good restaurants It was freezing cold when we were there it snowed and we are too glad to have stumbled upon Osulloc Tea House which served sample green tea to guests We bought some of their products as we love drinking green tea and was very impressed by the smoothness of their tea
11762,3,You may find a lot of souvenirs here please do ask ka ka ju se yo means discount please before you purchase 
11763,5,Souvenirs are usually not cheap everywhere in the world but you can get handmade personalized items from Insadong Love this place to the max 
11764,5,Insadong is great area surrounded by lots of attractions  shops and restaurants in walking distance  Many subway stations and local handmade stuff and also local food 
11765,5,With only 1 hour to spare I was initially reluctant to head to Invading And while I didnt traverse the whole street this time I was able to find some stunning gifts for friends and family and enjoyed a wonderful cup more like a soup bowl of Citron and Honey Coffee While theres a range of mainstream gifts the hand made paper stores are fantastic as are the art shops sure its touristy but take your time and soak up the atmosphere Even the Ukranian confectionery seller as entertainment A beautiful temple is also just of the main thoroughfare Finally while bargaining is acceptable the discounts are small so dont expect great reductions
11766,3,Visited the street on October during noon It was very crowded Maybe even more crowded than usual since it was a Sunday and weekend dedicated for Chinese culture Since were not interested in shopping that much nor in art or antiques we found this pedestrian street nice but didnt see anything special about it We tried one of the restaurants there but the food was mediocre
11767,4,We stayed very near to Insadong during our trip and there are just too many things to look at here We planned to spend only a few hours here but ended up staying till evening There are lots of resturants here thankfully and we took a rest and replenished our stomachs before moving on for more shopping The highlight in Insadong is the Ssamjigil shopping malllook out for my review on it please for more information
11768,5,The arts and culture hub of Seoul There are numerous art galleries traditional arts and crafts shops tea houses restaurants street performers and cosmetic shops Definitely a must visit place
11769,3,I dont do shopping so I was hoping for some photo opps Regrettably there were very few Alleys were over modernised and overloaded with advertising Food drinks were all tourist level A nogo for me
11770,4,The place is located at the near city Lots of small shops of boutique and food Souvenir gifts are everywhere Streets are clean is one of the top list for tourist attraction Some of the craft items are very expensive so try to bargain your way there
11771,4,Definitely a touristcentered location but still lots of fun We were able to purchase a ton of gifts to bring home and most were very reasonably priced There is a multistory plaza full of locally crafted items ranging from very expensive to reasonably priced unique items Start at top and walk down
11772,3,We had a good time walking around the area and checking out a few of the shops for the first 30mins but its not really what we were expecting It almost felt like we were exiting through a really long gift shop Most shops have the same stuff with only a few that stand out I guess I just set the bar too high in my own mind and left a little disappointed If you have extra time its worth a quick visit but I wouldnt go out of my way to come here
11773,5,When you have a lot of time visit the street  its a nice area with shops they make sugar candies with almond you will to see how candy makers work it is a fun show There is a nice big tea shop if you are a tea lover Many restaurants available with no waiting needed The area is not crowded it has enough space for all Small food stands sell varieties of street food nicely presented We hired taxi to get there A really enjoyable place have fun
11774,4,There are loads of restaurants for you to eat at here along with coffee shops Some street stalls selling different things as well as little shops for you to have a look round We had some amazing food in Insadong
11775,5,Get lost in the small streets of the Insadong area ; stop for a while push a door and enter a small traditional restaurant where you can get genuine local food for a very reasonable price
11776,5,Small streets crammed with shops cafes and so on near to several of the main palaces Very interesting to look around
11777,5,Although I wasnt in Seoul to shop if shopping is what you want this is the place Beautiful shops including clothing potteryceramics souvenirs food stalls speciality tea crafts etc and little side streets with gorgeous restaurants
11778,4,A touristy place and overly priced but must visit as theres just too many interesting stuff there to ignore Good atmosphere nice walk and good place to hangout with fellow tourist having a drink Lots of restaurants concentrated at that street beautifully designed and hidden within the alleys Just hard to pick one that you want to try
11779,3,nothing special in Insadong or may be we were not in the rights places lot of people trendy restaurant 
11780,5,From mass produced souvenirs to hand crafted art youll find it all in this very funky shopping district The vibe here is so different than the other shopping areas Dont miss the building with with ramps instead of stairs
11781,4,Insadong wasnt exactly what I expected I was hoping to see hanoks and traditional buildings Nonetheless it was still a pleasant area to walk around in  Its quite commercialised and locals know it as a tourist trap Souvenirs here are a little pricey Id recommend getting similar ones at Namdaemun market instead as itll be cheaper A pack of ten hanbok teddy keychains cost 20000 won I got mine at namdaemun for 14000  Most of the shops here close quite early By night time you might find some buskers performing in the area
11782,4,Insadong is a tourist area with lots of shops and restaurants Wandering the side streets is a good break from ultra modern Seoul With few must see sights in this city InsaDong is a nice break and a view into old Seoul
11783,5,Amongst the many trinkets on display purses mother of pearl clothing etc beware of what is Made in China There is so much to see and buy and eat Restaurants and Tea Houses can be found in alleys
11784,4,fancy street many shops everything to buy pretty mocal stuff a very nice walk up to the palace cosmetic food close jewel china
11785,4,This is quite a buzzing place with tons of souvenir shops interspersed with some interesting peaceful art galleries SsamzieGil is an interesting arcade with shops on different levels and a rather bedraggled roof garden with giraffes The cafe at the top has a lane way full of love messages Round the corner at the top you find theJogyesa temple full of colourful lantern and chanting monks and further down at the other end isTapgol park with a pagoda and other temple relics
11786,5,We stopped by Insadong after a walk in the Secret Garden This is a good stop for the more unusual gifts to bring home Ssamziegil Mall is particularly worth a visit as it houses a lot of little shops that sell unique items from the artists themselves Some artistpotters also maintain a shop here  there are galleries where you can pick up local art as well There are many eateries  restaurants in the area too
11787,5,I have been coming to Korea regularly since 1978 and Insadong remains my favorite part of the city It is filled with shops galleries and abundant selection of places to eat The shows in the galleries change every week or so making it possible to see variety of artists and exhibits It is becoming more modern but still retains old world charm With the Main Street blocked to traffic you can wander freely without worrying about cars My favorite place to spend an afternoon no matter what time of the year
11788,4,Insadong is a weekend walking street full of culture and arts Nice food nice coffee places nice souvenir stores and interesting people
11789,4,good place for a walk and enjoying small galleries best choice even on a rainy day Wide range of small shops jewellery ceramics
11790,4,Yes Insadong is full of tourists and shops selling souvenirs but it is also much more than that  There is a lot of great street food stalls tons of free art galleries to wander through and if you take a detour off the main street there are a ton of small alleys packed with tea houses mandu places tiny restaurants coffee shops and other hidden gems There are usually tourist information people hanging around in read coats who have really useful free maps of the area and can even recommend some good places to eat
11791,5,Lovely place to walk and people watch There are some nice stores to buy souvenirs We found a fantastic place on a side street that sold home made dumplings Enjoy
11792,3,You must explore all the nooks and crannies here There are all kinds of ally ways with different art and tea shops We found a dumpling place that was great And as always we walked away with some great art pieces
11793,3,insadong was an awesome place to see traditional artworks and craft however for a budgetstudent traveler like me there is not much to buy or purchase it would be good to pair up the Insadong visit with the nearby palaces or traditional village to make it more worth the journey  But if youre into traditional craft and antiques and have the  to spend Insadong is the place to shop
11794,3,Insadong is overrated as it does not have many things to offer The stalls are just selling the same thing and there is not much to explore
11795,5,This is such a nice blend of current and old mixed together Great location for tourists to buy all the souvenirs and enjoy some great treats There are art galleries along the way and tons of shops for gifts Treats range from sweet to savory and you will end up buying something why fight it We enjoyed this shopping experience very much  bought lots of little giveaways for friends coworkers and family Highlight was the almond treats wrapped in silk honey
11796,5,This is a very sweet street filled with all kinds of souvenir shops You can find everything from traditional carved wooden folk masks to personalized wax stamps fans duramagi grey monk robes etc Its also just by the Jogyesa Temple which is a beautiful mustsee
11797,4,Full of restaurants bars and trendy shops Lots of locals and tourists alike Busy especially at weekends Worth visitng the huge musical centre at the bottom end of Insadong
11798,5,On Saturdays from 2 to 10pm and Sundays 10am to 10pm Insadong comes alive Parts of streets are closed off and there are vendors everywhere The street food is excellent The shops are a mixture of artistry high fashion and unusual creative items  Anguk Station Line 3 Exit 6 There are two seperate sections that come alive but it is hard to describe to ask for directions once you get there
11799,5,Went here with my parents and 2 teenage sisters and the loved it We shopped for little souvenirs and streetfood My mom bought some houseware and skincare products Check out Ssamziegil which is a three or four floor building filled with nice little shops selling home decor clothing and accessories It wasnt too crowded when we went and the atmosphere was pleasant
11800,4,Insadong is a really long street full of quirky little shops mainly selling the more traditional items It has the occasional cosmetic shop the majority of which can be found in the Myeong Dong area but in Insadong you can find things like jewellry tea houses street food etc  It is slightly overpriced as a main tourist area so be prepared
11801,5,I just loved the shops here  ceramics hand painted wall hangings small ceramic pendants colorful fans  it is a bit difficult to pull oneself away from here Prices are fixed and reasonable The only discount is if you would pay by cash instead of by card  There are a couple of National Souvenir Shops which seem to be certified and where I found some Celadon of very good value  With plenty of Tea rooms and some street food this is good fun for at least half a day I ended up going around the shops in the street 3 times
11802,2,Is a great location to wander if you realize its focus is the tourist in South Korea Plenty of shopping and collectibles you can find plenty of foreigners and plenty of happy local merchants waiting for your business
11803,4,While Myeongdong is all about hustle and bustle In Insadong you will find a more artsy vibe with various galleries exhibits and stores selling local crafts and wares I also remember there were a number of places selling Kpop souvenirs Supposedly there are numerous restaurants in the area where you can get an American style breakfast although I didnt get a chance to look for them I did eat at BlackSmith a local chain specializing in Italian food thats usually in Kdramas and it wasnt bad but wasnt great either I only wanted to try it because I have seen it in numerous Kdramas
11804,4,Insadong is a touristy but very cultural place This was where we got to try wearing the hanbok for free at the Tourist Information Center and where we got to taste the BEST MANDU in the city
11805,5,So mane thing to look and buy Of course a lot of restaurants as well The choice is huge And the prices are very good you can ask for discount everywhere If you need TaxFree money refund you can do it right there So comfortable for tourist  Also many nice things to see
11806,4,If you are looking for comparatively better quality souvenir Insadong is the place in Seoul There are also little surprises such as some street performers at separate location of the street
11807,4,You will find the common souvenirs here like shirts pens stuff toys key chains and a lot more Shop owners speak english and japanese
11808,5,It is very nice place to dine in  shopping  food art and craftetc it is very pack during peak periods 
11809,5,You can find here local crafts and souvenirs not available in other shopping areas It is near the bukchon hanok village and samcheongdong Samcheongdong is a very charming row of shops and cafes very unique to korea Its like a quaint neighborhood full of treasures ready for tourists like us to devour Try the snacks students are having
11810,4,If you love art hanging out  talking and seeing fashionable people  this is probably the best place With Wifi all around the place and tasting delicious Ice Cream 3 I love to be here They have many artsy shops it quite expensive I didnt buy it I am just happy seeing around and enjoying this place with live music going on Really nice  How to get here  Anguk Station exit 6  cheesyapeetumblrcomtaggedtravel
11811,5,This is the place for enjoying the Korea The souvenir stores in the main street are for the first time visitors The small stores local restaurants unique coffee shop are for the experienced ones Insa dong doesnt like dongdaemun or myongdong changes over time It keeps the same feeling for anyone who wants to come and see the old Korea the Korea before KPop before cell phones I visit Korea very oftenalthough I usually stay in Gangnam area south of Seoul if have to choose one place to visit in the north part of Seoul I will choose Insadong
11812,4,This area is more crafts and traditional a slower pace than the other market areas I had a great experience at Myung Sin Dang art shop I had a stamp made there
11813,4,a nice place to pick up souvenirs for ppl back home  pouches keychains etc  many tea houses here too if ure interested in tea leaves  can visit Gyeongbukgong or the musical instrument mart nearby
11814,4,One of my favorite areas in Seoul for the collection of art galleries tea houses shopping or just walking Can be calm and peaceful or really bustling on a weekend
11815,4,The street is a delight to walk Do make sure you explore the side streets branching out from the main street We found the souvenirs to be expensive and our negotiation skills were not up to the mark However the farther along you walk the cheaper things get  You can reach this by walking from the Gyeongbokgung Palace
11816,3,Great for shopping for souvenirs and taking a stroll through a semitraditional part of town Sometimes crowded with tourists though
11817,5,Now this is one part of Seoul that you really do not want to miss Its fairly costly but you dont need to buy Go there just to experience the atmosphere  And please do support the cocktail guy with his cocktailsinabag and his brilliantly crafted world map Oh and the honey sweet makers on the metro rail end of the road They are arguably THE best entertainers there  The restaurants are expensive so Id recommend to stroll around and maybe buy a souvenir there and head elsewhere for supper  But do yourself a favour go about an hour before sunset and watch the whole area transform as sunlight gives way to darkness and the plethora of lights switch on Lovely
11818,4,The price is fairly cheap and the vendors are very friendly and informative You will not fell robbed here instead they will recommend you for best prices and best souvenirs
11819,5,Yes its somewhat touristy and full of kitschy souvenirs but thats not all there is to Insadong and the casual artsy atmosphere made this area a fun place for roaming around With plenty of street food and snack shops along the way I wandered up and down the back alleys snacking and stopping in art galleries there were some nice modern pieces and boutiques I skipped by the plethora of super touristy shops full of junk and instead focused on visiting the galleries off the main street you have to really look some would have been easy to breeze past if my map hadnt told me they were there and higher end shops with items like handmade ceramics and jewelry  In the middle was the Ssamjigil building which was 4 or so stories full of boutique stores bursting with trendycute items fashion accessories jewelry toys handmade soap tea ceramics etc from local artists I found it much more fun to spend time walking though here browsing than in the larger malls with chain stores you can find anywhere  It was easy to walk to Insadong after touring Changdeokgung Palace only the ice in February slowed me down somewhat and Id recommend the combination if visiting this area of the city
11820,3,We wandered over here one morning during our stay in Seoul We found lots of shops selling antiques souvenirs and all types of food If you like to shop or need souvenirs it would be really fun It wasnt a bad way to get a feel for Seoul at the beginning of our trip but I dont think its a mustsee The area is very touristy but it is close to central Seoul so if you just want to go for a walk and see part of this city this is not a bad place to head to
11821,3,Not much to recommend Insadong besides onestop shopping for souvenirs The street is lined with stores all selling the same touristy stuff mostly made in China A few nice stores selling prints and ceramics Clothes are expensive and sized for petite women A fun shopping mall with stores spiraling around a courtyard Excellent and expensive tea shop Try the green tea bonus to share with a friend
11822,4,I get the feeling the prices here were rather inflated for tourists It is a nice place to explore though and some of the food places on this street are worth visiting Particularly the shaved ice with various toppings
11823,4,This is one of my favorite places in Seoul You can buy souvenirs here but it is cheaper in Namdaemun Market The shopkeepers speak English And there is a building where you can reach the top just by walking around and looking at the shops
11824,4,the main street is nice if you are looking for traditional souvenirs The street was clean and people were friendly but they are there for the tourists so
11825,4,One of my favourite places in Seoul nice little street with lots of arty stuff There is a nice cafe at the top of one of the building go have a cuppa there after walking down half the street
11826,4,Cultural hub of Seoul It is a place where you can buy good souvenirs and find a good restaurant You can see street performers and various stalls It is nice to have a walk from 5 pm till night
11827,5,We were taken here by local seoul residents Definitely an under 30 event Shops had much higher quality souvenirs and handmade items Coffee shops and restaurants everywhere Went to a 5 story open air mall that was all Ramps Side streets worth a look
11828,4,This is a pedestrianish style street full of local craft souvenirs and cheap eats and drinks It is also a good place to people watch as there are locals and visitors about and the occasional street entertainer Close buy is the recently redeveloped small river area which is lovely for a stroll or jog
11829,3,i was expecting more so was kinda disappointed when there wasnt much to see or shop in insadong there are shops selling souvenirs which reminds me very much of shops in chinatown there is a small shopping mall there but it wasnt as exciting as I hope it would be but a good thing is we got lost when we walked from myeodong to insadong and we were finding our way in samcheongdong which is more interesting there are alot of nice cafes there and i see some interesting shops which were closed as I was there on a Sunday and altho there are alot of tourists there but it doesnt feel as touristy and commercialised as insadong take a nice stroll down the rows of cafes
11830,3,Good place to go for a lunch are some trinket shopping More of a younger vibe in this area and I would recommend doing it if you are in the area such as Bukucho Not far from the Palace
11831,5,While Myeongdong is all about shopping I liked Insadong better for the independent shops street exhibitions and an artist village somewhere in the middle of Insadong
11832,4,if you go here you have to go to anuk station some locals dont know how to go here so better ask the info person in the subway stations souvenirs are cheap and very near to the city like palace and blue house
11833,5,Fortunately I stayed in Insadong It was a great artsy area with restaurants galleries musicians and a wonderful lively and fun vibe Its open till about 830 or 9 PM There is also an information kiosk and the Metro Anguk Station exit 6 is very close
11834,5,Consistent in being able to produce the things that I was looking for at reasonable prices  may not be dirt cheap like hoeyeon but the quality of the items are worth the price you pay for Just roam around the area and do drop by Jogyesa Temple which is also so near A must visit in Seoul ;
11835,4,This was the location of my hotel just off the main street of Insadonggil Its a touristy road mostly pedestrianised with occasional cars Lots of art craft and souvenir shops and a small multilevel mall with the same shops There are some interesting things to look at and good photographic opportunities Towards the south end youll find street market stalls Heading further south will lead you to a bigger shopping area underground markets and the interesting Cheongaecheon canal which flows through the city At the north end of Insadonggil youll find the two most popular palaces of Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung and the Bukchon Hanok village Its a pleasant district to spend an afternoon or longer wandering around
11836,4,Its best to go there early around 900 am when the souvenir shops open to get a good deal Worth seeing the old post office and the Buddha temple in the vicinity
11837,4,Yes this place is kind of touristy but I still love it Ive done quite a bit of souvenir shopping here for my family There are terrific restaurants as well as street food vendors On Saturday this place is even better since theres a variety of street performers
11838,5,insadong is not just a shopping area but a cultural showcase as well Insadong is a melting pot of diverse art where you see different kinds of crafts regardless of any style whether western or eastern designs Insadong is a place where you could buy souvenirs and of course a must buy is the Kings dessert where you will enjoy those people making it They do entertaining chants so it will definitely capture you and spend a bit for their dessert
11839,4,Never get enough to walk along the insadong street just to smell the flavor of Korea enjoying the traditional tea of Korea and buy items that originally made in Korea
11840,5,This is one neighbourhood that you will want to visit again and again You can find just about anything to buy at a much lesser cost compared to other shopping sites Spend a couple of hours and do not miss the street food  most of them are freshly made right in front of you and they taste too good We tried the pancake and wish we had one of these shop where we live  Apart from food and inexpensive shops there are quite a few historically relevant sites viz Beautiful Tea Musuem Hanji People we could not find this thoug to name a few You can find uniformed Insadong ambassadors guides to help you navigate the streets
11841,4,Here are things that I really liked about Insadong  varied food stalls Really affordable The red bean cakes are a must try fun to people watch People from different cultures can be seen here shopping awesome workmanship Ssamjigil Mall is located here where a lot of handmade crafts can be bought cheaper souvenirs
11842,4,It was a good experience browsing through stuff especially some the handmade craft and I would recommend to someone who does not have much time to go around other places There was a large store at a crossing which had good souvenirs at prices that seemed reasonable It is totally touristy
11843,5,Lots of souvenirs pottery and artwork  street food was abundant Most of the souvenirs are fixed price and they wouldnt give us any discount Look out for the lady who makes rice and nuts candy Shes dressed in a traditional hanbok the candies she makes are amazingly delicious Theres another man who makes little round puffs filled with red bean and theyre soooo good to eat when its freezing cold
11844,3,If youre looking for shopping myeongdong is better Other people have mentioned the art here and it is more artsy and cultural than myeongdong Its also quite small The way it was talked up to me I thought it would be a huge area but realistically it is one main street with a few off shoots
11845,5,Insadong is the best place to buy souvenirs where hundreds of shop offer a great price for a wide variety of products
11846,5,This is a very good place for tourist The shops sell good touristsy stuff When your legs get tired there are scores of coffee places for a nice cuppa and rest including Starbucks
11847,4,You will find in this street a lots of traditional kroean stuff and tons of foreigners Also you can find a bunch of good restaurants in here The things to look for are in specialized small shops on the street and not in a big shoping center
11848,4,Nice part of Seoul lots of souvenir shops and cosy restaurants Some nice art galleries and a nice street to walk in It is not big maybe a few hundred meters nice to take a walk and have some food There is an information office in Insadong They also have some guesthouses and good hotels Close to subway exit Anguk
11849,5,Love the atmospherethe street performance and the drum performance by the cultural group help to create an fiesta atmospherelocal restaurants and cheap souveniers
11850,4,This is an interesting mix of shopping from upper scale items small private stores to trinkets and antiques or are they The street food vendors were plentiful and delicious and one can spend hours browsing here For new fashion and electronics stick to the Tower area and malls but for unique and different along with quant Insadong is one of may places but probably the best
11851,5,a walking and shopping street that you wont need to give way for car passed bythe government has make this a walking street and it is safe to walkfor those who like to have something fancy and the one and only accessoriesyou may go to ssamjiegil but the price could be slightly higher as it is special onea good place that for those who like to buy souvenirs
11852,5,The heart of the old Seoul and center for artists and anything creative Plenty of places to eat good bakeries and many coffee shops Easy access from Anguk station
11853,4,I enjoyed Insadong I was worried it would be a bit too commercial but it felt really nice I went in the morning walking through at about 1030 on a Saturday when things were just starting to wake up I eyed the various souvenirs ranging from the I heart Korea shirts to nice wooden carvings to motherofpearl jewelry boxes Nice walk
11854,5,Its full of cultural and artistic feel at this place Theres a traditional snack along the street which instantly melt in your mouth Must try Lots of souvenirs at cheaper prices than other places within Seoul  I like Samjjigil a small mall selling artistic stuffs A colorful place
11855,5,A great place to get all those bits and pieces to take home We bought most of our gifts here and visited the most exotic tea shop I have ever been in A lovely place to stroll and you are not hassled Remember to ask for a discount it is expected
11856,3,Our tour guide told us she was taking us to the tourist shopping area and we were not disappointed We picked up lots of little gifts and enjoyed walking through the streets and sampling street fare A fun afternoon
11857,5,Especially fun on weekends when the street is pedestrianonly this is like a street fair that runs for many blocks with lots of narrow side streets and culdesacs offering hidden treasures Everyone there is having a great time strolling shopping getting a cool drink in a cafe and people watching  Hint Try the local favorite PatBingSu a sweet milkshake that can be customized to different tastes fruitgreen teacoffeeetc but is usually based on fresh fruit Best Ive ever had
11858,5,we chose the Fraser Suites recommended by a friend and the whole area is a pleasant surprise  lots of great restaurants and cafes and it offered a quiet corner of the busy city and yet not far from the shopping and business districts We ended up spending a lot more time around the area for restaurants
11859,5,This place was fun for us they had a lot of the candy and toys that I use to play with when I was a kid
11860,4,Nice collections of shops  restaurants I picked up most of my souvenirs from this area  Weekdays are better Weekends are too crowded for my taste If going in the summer time head out in the evening to avoid the heat  you can take a night walk along the this manmade river nearby Shops  vendors start packing up  leaving  9PM
11861,4,If anyone is short on time but still want to get some souvenirs from Korea this is the place There are numerous souvenir shops in this area and much of the local character
11862,3,Good spot for buying gift back home safe area with lot of shops and restaurants
11863,4,A beautiful place to just walk around and enjoy the sights and sounds There are quaint little shops to browse with lots of trinkets and artsy pieces I wish I could remember the name of the cafe where we had the delicious ginger tea The staff were very nice and accommodating They would also take a polaroid of you and you could either sign the picture and leave your mark by hanging the picture on the wall or take the memorabilia with you We left out picture I hope I see it when time we go back
11864,4,I like Insadong for its open shops and loads of traditional items You can learn and see a lot by walking around the shops Some of the artisan crafts are amazing and top quality The downside of this area is that it can be a tourist trap complete with high prices and crowds
11865,3,not much shoppings and things sold there are not relatively cheap
11866,5,The Old Tea Shop in Insadong is recommended in Lonely Planet and yes it is very cool I liked it a lot and enjoyed a cup of cool 5 taste tea It was fun to spend a couple of hours shopping down the main street in Insadong Its a good place to buy lots of cool and not so expensive gifts food clothes jewellery knickknacks After a couple of hours you are ready for something different though
11867,4,Great little shops at the top end near Anguk subway area As you go down the street the shops get junkier
11868,4,perfect for those who love original artworks and small trinklets the street is lined with galleries and traditional teahouses while the alleys on the sides are chockablock full of restaurants and more teahouses love this area
11869,5,Insadong is the best place that we went to for shopping The shopping for souvenirs korea novelty items and clothing was great The prices were affordable and negotiable to a certain extent We bought keychains traditional fans tshirts souvenir plates We ate at a wonderful restaurant and there are 100s of choices there are also traditional food carts on the road to experiment and try some of the local delicacies Insadong is a MUST do in Seoul
11870,4,there is first starbucks who put signboard in local language in the world after that Starbucks started to use local languages for the signboard This street used to be very quietfor the pensive writers artiests etc however it became a bit commercial street but you can still get nice traditional gifts for your beloved ones if you explore the allies inside of main street you can enjoy local food and traditional teas
11871,2,The whole place is a tourist trap Everything is pricey Nothing spectacular about this place
11872,4,This is the only place you can buy traditional souveniors in Seoul The first Starbuck who puts their shops sign in local language in the world because this street is really traditional one so the all the residence of that street could not accept English sign board in the street It was big issue when Starbucks penestrated in that antique street However grwoing as a commercial place step by step the old nostalgy started to fade away from the street But still worth to visit to feel the sense of Korea traditional arts and antiques
11873,5,Lots of little shops and street vendors  great way to spend a couple of hours or so Restaurants are all located in the little back alleyways so lots of fun to roam We went in the afternoon but its probably tons of fun at night
11874,4,Very interesting and lively especially on the weekend There are lots of food stands and interesting things to try and look at
11875,4,great place to shop for souvenirs good price and a very nice place to visit
11876,4,Dont be shy and head into each and every shop and youl definitely be able to find something unique inside Youl be able to spend a good part of your day there just wandering around and trying food Theres a fried pancake shop that always has a queue Worth trying for the sweet pancakes
11877,5,Cute souvenirs but the street snacks are so yummy A must try is the royal candies they spin out of honey and the brown sugar bun type pastries They made my trip There are also stores selling teas which is always nice to bring home
11878,5,Excellent place for visiting relax and just bask yourselves amongst the artistic stuff here But be warned its not cheap  good things come at a price
11879,5,Loved Insadong Many small streets with quaint restaurants to check out Especially loved the feel of the area with drawingspaintings around Ssamziegil is a must visit there as well with all the artsy things for sale Some stuff can be found outside for cheaper though so spend wisely Otherwise its still goo for a lookaround
11880,4,A relaxing shopping street selling a lot of knick knacks and souvenirs one of my favorite areas in Seoul
11881,4,This is the place to buy souvenirs and gifts for friends at home
11882,5,This is one of my favorite streets in Korea There are lots of teahouses fantastic restaurants coffeehouses and lots of shopping The shopping is for those with an artistic bent or for souvenirs There is food being prepared in front of you as well Have fun
11883,4,Insadong was listed in our suggested Cultural Heritage itinerary and we visited it late at night towards the end of our 2nd evening in Korea for some shopping  We found several shops selling souvenir items and bought several gifts for friends and family There were some food stalls outside but we didnt get to buy any food gifts We got some goldplated bookmarks several slippers shirts a fan cute socks earrings and several keychains   We went back the next day for some dinner and some more shopping Although we visited late at night we felt safe walking around this area although we kept to the main street We did encounter some slightly drunk people singing out loud or shouting but nothing serious  We learned later from the map we got at an information booth near the entrace that there were several historical sites in this area which we missed since we visited at night This would be a good reason to come back 
11884,4,Had a 10 hour layover at Incheon took a 7 hour transit tour with Hana Tour to Seoul for just US40 visted the famous stream plaza 2 palaces temple and Insadong Had free traditional lunch at Insadong got to do shopping many shops take US dollars and credit card Shop keepers were very friendly street food and souvenirs were cheap eye catching unique crafts for cheap spent about over an hour wanted to stay longer our tour guide was wonderful though you cant see all of seoul in 5 hours as the travel time from to airport was over an hour each way you still can atleast see parts of it well worth it I will recommend this to family and friends and will try this again especially Insadong plenty of shopping restaurants and just a place to hang out day or night
11885,3,My third time at Insadong over a period of ten years and found that it has become too commercialised vendors and shopkeepers indifferent to tourists better service at Myeongdeong food at some restaurants only soso and quite a few overpriced Best thing was the Tourist Promotion Board workers who stopped to ask tourists what help they needed We were very grateful to the young man who gave us clear direction to Hotel Doulos which was tucked away in a backstreet; glad they now have such a service thank you very much
11886,3,This is a great place to stroll and window shop because it is pretty active and inviting but the prices and goods are definitely aimed at the tourists or higher end shoppers You can find the same things in the underground arcades or market areas in Dongdaemun
11887,4,one of a must to visit Theres shops to buy places to eat and also souvenirs shops in a very good price
11888,5,The walk into Insadong from the metro station was quite fascinating  The street has this warm  cozy feeling to it There are souvenir shops on both sides of the road  I did a fair bit of Souvenir shoppping  the National Souvenir Centre The staff can be intrusive  overbearing The pricing is also on the higher side when compared with smaller storesshops  I shopped at another store whose name i have now forgotten The lady who attended to me was very courteous All the merchandise that i bought  the store was beautifully giftwrapped  Even if you dont intend to go shopping you must visit Insadong to enjoy the walk down the narrow street There are plenty of restaurant  street stalls should you get hungrythirsty
11889,5,I went to Insadong on a weekend evening in Autumn and I really loved the vibe of this place  buzzing crowds street food markets good restaurants and teahouses We enjoyed trying snacks such as the sugar filled pancakes and the traditional court cakes We had dinner at Tobang which was delicious and very popular  its not that easy to find but its next to a building with some trees out the front and has a white sign with black chinese characters Most amusing was that there were two guys employed to stand around looking for lostlooking English speakers and offering help
11890,5,I went there 3 times and I really enjoyed it I went to Ssamziegil The building full of local shops esp i bought some handmade natural soaps from a shop at Ssamziegil Checked out for green tea icecream 
11891,4,Quite interesting place lots of somewhat unusual shops Quite nice for a little walk
11892,5,I really like Insadong not as crowded as Hongdae What I like the most was its ambience artsy and peaceful I went to Ssamzigil and it was really nice place Instagramable and pretty
11893,5,This is a nice neighborhood style shopping area If weather is cooling its a good half day walk through shops cafe and restaurants
11894,5,I would say Insadong is more of a Tourist focused shopping but a very pleasant experience it can get a crazy crowd if you go during the weekend evening
11895,4,Great Location near food shopping and Public transport Walking distance to the main Seoul Palaces
11896,5,Very busy with lots of food and shopping choices Close to downtown major markets and ancient palaces
11897,5,Saw this place during a day tour when I first got to Seoul There are a lot of little tea shops and dessert places here Also all of the stereotypical tourist shopping that youd want to do is here mixed in with some local boutiques and restaurants
11898,5,Insadonggil is well known as a traditional street and represents the culture of the past and the present It contains a mixture of historical and modern atmosphere and is a unique area of Seoul that truly represents the cultural history of the nation
11899,5,Get into the Indadong Hanok village lots of trendy little shops and food outlets Does get busy but full of character
11900,4,This is like the place to hunt for souvenirs to bring home It is a long street with shops and cafes and even has a new mall adjacent to it Many handicrafts to choose from
11901,4,Insadong is a bit of everything hard to put it in a single box so to speak It is a bit touristy no doubt but it also has many other facets to it Street vendors shops restaurants a bit of arts and culture as well a hot pot pf sorts of things But when in Seoul I would say it is a must see and a stroll through the streets is a nice afternoon activity Also to remember that many other key areas of Seoul are not far hence it is easy to combine this with visiting some palaces or myeongdong for example
11902,4,If you only have time to do either Myeongdong or Insadong no brainer; skip Insadong But if you can do both then Insadong is a nice couple of blocks of arts and crafts stores with cafes interspersed The little alleyways and shops on the second and third floors are not to be missed as well Yes it is touristy and fashionable but thats how this city rolls On the south end of the street there is a little open plaza where there are often street performers worth a gander And beside the plaza is a manned tourist info booth if you need tourist info of course
11903,4,We were staying at Insadong and hence it was easy to take a round in the area in late evening There are lots of shops with craft work and souveniers street food and organised restaurants We felt safe walking around at this hour 
11904,4,A bit disappointed by the area its for tourists and there is nothing genuine The narrow streets could be nice but again spoiled for groups of tourists
11905,5,Boutiques restaurants check the side alleys for the best ones tea shops Insadong has everything Beware of the more touristic cheap shops where most things are Made in China I found wonderful artists and artisans who are selling their beautiful craft in their small niche Take a couple of hours to explore Insadong
11906,5,Bring enough cash and card as here is full of souvenir and eatery Nice place to walk and long shopping street

11910,5,Unlike the megacity feel and architecture of the rest of Seoul the Insadong area includes an open compound of very low buildings which comes to life at sunset similar to Taipeis night markets but chic  It includes many diverse restaurants patiseries and fashion shops at a very wide price range carefully designed to have a chic look and uniqueness to each which contribute to the general great vibe of the place In the wider streets you can find cosmetic stores and restaurants open until late There are also great ARVR places highly recommended experience as they are cheap and lots of fun  You will meet there eople from all walks of life coming after a rough day at school or at work to eat and enjoy together and also especially many young people dressed by latest Kpop and japanese inspired fashion

12014,5,A place to be when you are looking for your pasalubongs for your family Also Ssamziegil is a place to be when you are looking for a unique items
12015,4,There are many alleys in Insadong and you probably want to see it all I went there and walk in the main street only and enter the Ssamziegil Shopping Complex which full of artsy things
12016,4,This is a long street with many attractions and little quirky monuments and a beautiful wall Muriel  Lots of shops eateries and cafes Lots of interesting side alleys with restaurants and art shops Beautiful park at the end with an old temple and square
12017,5,Great shopping for both the traditional and the modern items Prices are lower than in Myeongdong and the crowd is not as many
12018,3,We visited Insadong on a busy Sunday to experience the crowds street food and lively atmosphere We were disappointed at how many souvenir shops there were on the main street all selling the same cheaply made things We much preferred wandering down the side streets and alleys they have far more character than the main street
12019,5,Lots of market stalls to see with food and trinkets being sold Do check the little side street as there are some good architecture to see and interesting restaurants and art shops
12020,5,If youre looking for an area thats chic yet quaint youll love the little alleyways of Insadong just waiting to be discovered Lots of artisanal cafes and upcoming designer stores here Food prices are on the high side but i guess youre paying for the decor and artsy ambience There were also some vendors hawking street food such as rice cakes and croquette The locals come here in all their vintage finery to take pictures Even if youre not feeling flush its worth a walk through just to feast the eyes
12021,5,Insadong area gives you surprises as some of their shops I can say most of the shops are selling unique stuffs which we enjoy going into every shops to check thing out really worth to walk around and spend some time in this area I did not get the name of the shop lots but they have a yellow word  on the outside of the building Every small shops in there carry their own products and we spend like hours to check every single one out
12022,5,Many restaurants and shops in this street Must Insadong Ssamjigil wonton restaurants beside Ssamjigil street food tea house 10000won bag souvenir shop
12023,3,Insadong used to be a great place to visit; small production artisans practicing their craft and selling their wares at a terrific price since there was a lack of middlemen restaurants that were painstakingly true to the roots of the dishes they prepared and when the sun went down a nice local nightlife offering a variety of drinks and food at reasonable prices where people can sit and talk for hours  Then the rents started to go up and the artisans were forced out and replaced by shops selling inferior products of lower quality The interesting mom and pop restaurants went away in search of cheaper rent The nightlife got glitzed and glammed for the tourist dollars that always seemed to grow yearly Analytics have determined what you want to buy and marketers have designed this product mix or maximum return on investment  Thats not to say all the shops are gone but the neighborhood has definitely turned a corner and it is more tourist trap than artisan collection  There are still some famous old restaurants at the edges of Insadong that are worth checking out so the general area isnt such a wash  If you visit Insadong it will be interesting but not the place of its reputation at least not any more
12024,3,Alot of unique shops and also antique shops Visit ssamziegil market on the main road of insadong Unique mallbazaar with oneofthekind clothes furniture etc Plenty of street food along the main road
12025,4,We visited Insadong on a rainy day but armed with umbrellas had a really great time exploring the many art and craft shops In addition the are stores selling ice creams food souvenirs and everything else  In particular is the Ssamjigil mall which specializes in arts and crafts and the Poop Cafe also located in the mall  Would like to come here again in finer weather and to explore the smaller lanes that run adjacent to the main street
12026,5,Forget the modern malls this place is shops after shops after shops and it gives you a great walking work out visiting and seeing all that is available
12027,4,Very busy all sorts of shops small but good restaurants All explorable on foot and within a reasonable time span
12028,5,Insadong is good place to meet with friends over coffee The overall surrounding is also good for deserts and coffee There are lots of coffee shops in insadong so anyone can explore many new coffee shops Overall best place to hangout with friends and also after office hours for dinner as there are various options for food and different style of restaurants
12029,5,This is the place for souvenirs but they ask for cash and will even take US dollars at some stores in between lots of great places to eat and drink You are tempted to spend hours getting small gifts
12030,3,We combined a walk through Insadong after a morning visiting the Gyeonbokgung Palace and the Bukchon Hanok village both a short walk away A friend had said it was a good place to look for gifts and ceramics In fact we didnt buy anything but enjoyed looking round the souvenir shops and galleries and we noticed a lot of restaurants in the area It was really busy obviously a popular place A couple of nights later we decided to go back for dinner but all the shops were already closed and it was also hard to find a restaurant that was still open We did find one but they were closing at 830 and turning customers away from about 8pm so make sure you go during the daytime or eat early if going for dinner
12031,4,Great street with various shops  juju tea art  craft fashion galleries  plenty of traditional restaurants But try not to go in the weekend as it gets very busy
12032,4,I stayed in a hostel in this street the times i was in Seoul nice and safe in evening also nice to walk a zone is auto free from a hour
12033,4,Loads of shops selling everything and lots of street vendors as well hawking all kinds of snacks Try the local cotton candy using rice as a base  Lots of great souvenirs  Clothing is also available  Lots of fun if you like shopping
12034,4,We stayed near Insadong Street By walking distance one will be able to access to many tourist spot and Metro Station Good place to recommend tourist
12035,5,Insadong at first seems like a huge tourist trap full of packed souvenir shops but if you venture down the alleyways in search of a hanok tea house you will be transported back in time Also check out a really cool shop with stamped maps from the 1500s
12036,4,Arrived during lunch time Full house and we have to wait for available seat friendly owner and certainly must go restaurant if you visit South Korea
12037,5,I personally like this alley its nice and calm most of the time even though tourists are there Lot of shops to buy souvenirs and dine Colorful area Must go if you are in Seoul Jogyesa Temple is nearby so must visit it if you are in this area
12038,4,This is a good place to stop for lunch and dinner Local food and shops everywhere Small and narrow alleys which are quite rare to find in this skyscraper city Absolutely worth a visit
12039,5,There are plenty of souvenir shops around Not as cheap as Dongdaemun market but still good The shopkeepers are friendly and some can speak English The little alleys have hidden restaurants and very cheap accommodation if you are backpacking
12040,4,Nice area which at weekends is closed to traffic Lots of souvenir  antique painting and writting shops Above which are many places to eat and some great tea houses Dont stay on the main street go up all the side alleys as well
12041,4,Very fun street  definitely worth a quick stroll and you should check out Ssamzigil shopping center  but definitely feels a bit touristy If youre trying to buy nontouristy knickknacks Id recommend checking out other spots
12042,5,Always a great place to visit in Seoul Even when its crowded Insadong offers a relaxing atmosphere because of the architecture and cultural vibes There is a quaint little teahouse see pictures right in the middle of Insadong that I visited where you can buy traditional Chinese tea and teapots and a tea master brews tea for you It was just lovely and the tea was so refreshing I also loved that there was a vegetarian restaurant there since I dont eat meat
12043,4,Nice place for a tourist to visit You can find lots of traditional tea houses gift shops etc However it can be a little too touristy
12044,5,Great gift shops we bought many goods a memories here Very interesting shop where the woman who ran it had made EVERYTHING in the shop herself amazing
12045,3,There are plenty of restaurants and shops that sell traditional piecesartwork The street is not very long You can tour the whole place in an hour or two
12046,5,The market and Main Street have a huge selection of souvenirs for great prices Unique little shops and restaurants down narrow lanes I really enjoyed the 25 hrs we spent here  The metro stop is Anguk on the orange line 3
12047,5,The area represents what it was used to be like before the whole Industrial revolution and economic boom  Me and my wife used to date alot there and the place along with Bukchon and Seochon is truly old Seoul that has been the nations capital for centuries
12048,4,Insadong is so nice to wander around since its not so crowded as other areas You see the typical stores like artbox and lots of nice little cafes around there I would definitely recommend going to the small mall which is in the center of Insadongs main street
12049,4,Many restaurant choices Art galleries Good area to buy souvenirs Best enjoyed by strolling around the area Visit the Jogyesa temple then visit this area
12050,5,Decided to pay a visit to this location for its historical value and modern touches Basically all of Korea But it was a very relaxing walk with some good shopping good seats and surprises There is an amazing restaurant located all the way at the very end of invading you would never know its there but its where the celebs go to eat its called BukMakGol There are amazing jewelry shops art works and oh yeah the side entrance to the Presidents Blue House Great for couples
12051,5,Insadong is my favorite place of all Seoul it is rich in history full of traditional restaurants and tea houses but most of all art galleries
12052,5,Nice place for tea and bingeingThe lady is very friendly and do not visit this place in the weekendfully pack
12053,4,this is a good place to buy products for friends and family though most products made in China lot of restaurants to have a quick beer but seven eleven is cheapest
12054,3,Insadong as an area looked to be pretty touristy and gimmicky The Insadong PR and Tourist Info center was good for hanbok pictorials only 3 per person The Jogyesa Temple was a calming place to catch your breath I would go here again to try out the teahouses in the area Ssamzigil mall has a lot of touristy gimmicks if you have time to spend you can check those out but if not Id recommend steering clear
12055,5,I loved walking along Insadong Its really another way of appreciating Korea through the sights sounds and the tastes I found an artwork that I loved and a place for good tea and desserts Its worth the walk especially when you want to experience the artsy side of Korea
12056,3,Too many shopping places Korea is trying hard to get money out of tourists Some decent food places in the area
12057,4,A place where you can see a lot of arts and crafts and interesting souvenirs Nice to walk in the morning before the crowd arrived Few restaurants worth trying and a place where you can find hidden treasures
12058,4,This place you get to see a little side of old Korea Of course you can find lots of souvenirs and food place
12059,5,Good for families and even better with friends as this is a chill out venue that cool vibes Fun at night
12060,5,It was amazing to walk around Insadong satrting from the village ending to the Insadong market The village maintained its traditional look and so are he markets  Manal Oman
12061,4,Insadong is a lovely place to visit Although the souvenirs that were available here we could have also purchased in the underground markets Its a great place to spend a day and enjoy the touristy shops hire a hanbock and visit the castles
12062,5,we bought hanboks here it was pricy but good quality We also bought dojang  Wood is more affordable than stone Thanks
12063,5,This place is very beautiful and so many shop in there But when weekend very crowded so we not recomended to enjoy this place on weekend We want to come again to this place if we back to korea
12064,4,This is a very lively area with lots of shops selling paintings souvenirs and other handicrafts  There are also interesting little shops and traditional restaurants in the smaller side streets
12065,3,a great place in the city to pick up souvenirs like metal bookmarks key rings magnets chop sticks handicrafts mother of pearl jewelrydisplay boxes as well as more unique keepsakes There is a Hanbok photo place at the Tourist Information centre if you just want to put one on and take a photo Picked up some lovely jeweled for cheap here Lots of little places to eat off the street in little laneways We found a tiny place doing Mandoo dumplings which was fabulous a really authentic feel The cart selling cocktails amused us Pick up some cash on your way here I ran out and it was hard to find an ATM let alone one that took my card
12066,5,Insadong is a ten minute walk from myongdongjust across from dongdemunwent to a lovely cat cafe thereate at little India cafe it the curry was just ordinarytrust me Im a chef myselfbut at least it was meatlovelt casual area for soeveneirs and shopping
12067,5,in evening we scrolled down in the market I found bit expensive so not preferred any shopping but enjoyed street food  very nice stayed there for 2 hours
12068,4,I had looked forward to walking along the streets in Insadong There were plenty of unique shops and street vendors along the way so I had no troubles spending my money  As it was Monday afternoon the streets were not too crowded
12069,3,Shopping center whether for the expensive or cheap Some gifts can be obtained here Places to eat are also many choices Easily reachable by subway or taxi
12070,3,It is a haven for arts and crafts enthusiasts nevertheless good to browse through the many shops which are a bit different from the meongdong area
12071,5,I enjoyed walking through this area with its numerous shops galleries and restaurants The Poop Cafe is also located in this area Insadong is within walking distance of the Gyeongbokgung Palace
12072,4,Love this little pocket of Seoul Great little restaurants and cafes Specialty and artsy shops and galleries make this a special little area Just a few minutes from Myung Dong
12073,4,We stayed at the Centermark hotel for 5 nights which is in the heart of Insadong The city is very lively with a very busy alley of all sorts of stores and restaurants
12074,4,Full of people shops and small restaurants Good place to collect souvenirs though the choice is not very wide
12075,5,Hold on to your wallet This place has many cute things I barely able to hold my urge to splurge here While you are here find hotteok red bean sweet fried bun stall and enjoy warm hotteok
12076,5,Insadong also known as Ssamziegil is a famous tourists attraction The centre point of attraction is the beautifully decorated origami hanging above between buildings There are loads of souvenir shops around which is suitable for us tourists to spend our money on  If you are feeling tired fret not because inside Insadong itself lies numerous restaurants cafes and desserts just waiting for you to discover Is it worth your time UTTERLY YES
12077,5,Trendy area close to the Royal Court Plenty to domust see the changing of the guards Museums a plenty in the neighbourhood
12078,5,We had fun exploring the quaint shops Souvenirs food etc line the street We took the subway to get to the area The people at the information center were very helpful This is a must visit place in Seoul
12079,5,Such a cute location to visit Even if you only have a few hours it is worth seeing Lots of cuteness
12080,5,It was indeed and great shopping destination for those who love arts and culture you can see everywhere the pride of koreas culture and arts
12081,5,Really enjoyed this area of Seoul Small shops Many small restaurants Not a very large area and very manageable Fun to wander into the shops and see different merchandise Spent a lovely few hours including tea at Osulloc tea house Great fun
12082,3,It is a shopping area with shops and eateries Worth a walk through Plan to have a meal there Look out locals and tourists who rent local traditional outfits for photo opportunities
12083,4,Insadong is hard to avoid when you are in Seoul as its kinda between the 2 main palaces Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung and South of the Bukchon Hanok Village The main thoroughfare is interesting with many shops and street stalls but its a wander into the alleys where you will find the real gems There are many independent galleries around and shops selling pottery We found a traditional tea house which our friend brought us to 2 years ago which seemed to be attached to an art gallery Dawon judging by the reviews from here We also found a place which sold some delicious giant dumplings Must visit when in Seoul  Insadong has something for everyone
12084,4,I visited Insadong following the 10 top attractions in South Korea I must say I liked it since my arrival there are shops nice restaurants street food local souvenirs antique shops artisans cartoonists and many more Its certainly a vivid colorful attractive place to visit I also had a great time looking at locals dressed up in their traditional clothes coming and going from and to Insadong
12085,5,Quiet and clean shopping center with an artsy background There are lots of quaint shops along with delicious restaurants and coffee shops Very enjoyable
12086,5,Therere many souvenir shops restaurants cafe along the main street Many people in weekend Just looking around is fun
12087,5,We really enjoyed the walk down the long shopping street in Insadong There are cute shops and loads of places to stop for lunchdinner You will find nice gifts here and there are artsy shops not just your run of the mill cheap souvenir places
12088,4,This is another market in Korea with many fakes The prices were a bit high but I did find a couple of items to take home with me It is always fun to walk these markets
12089,5,There are many shops and restaurants here There is even a cat cafe A really nice street for strolling and lots of things to see
12090,5,Visited a temple across the street and then headed down Insadong Range of shops many handmade items a fancy green tea place and other kitschy shops Dressed up in hanboks and took pictures for 20
12091,4,Fun time to eat shop and see Best place for souvenir and street foods I wouldnt say completly cheap but more choices available Best snack for us was Dragons Beard candy Its made from fermented honey and corn flour with peanut sesame filling They have chocolate flavourgreen teaalmond and plain All the fillings inside remains same only the outer part flavour changes They make the candies right in front of your eyes
12092,4,We walked along the main Insadong shopping street Shops mainly catered for tourists selling souvenirs etc Quite a few cafes along the street situated on the second storeys of buildings Many restaurants too
12093,4,Along this street you can find so many souvenir shops selling south korea  handcrafts and maybe there is no similar place in Seoul or at least i dont knowthe products are not cheap comparing to other south asia countries but worth a visit
12094,5,Highlight of my recent trip Wonderful pedestrian street area with countless stores and high quality restaurants Stores have everything from the usual tourist tat through homemade artcreative stores to high end pottery and jewelry
12095,5,Walking along the streets of INSADONG makes you feel you are in the old era of Korea Full of living culture souvenirs etc
12096,1,Starbucks Insadong only one in Asia that wanted to charge extra for a glass of water with your 6 coffee Excuse me Cheap Cheap
12097,5,Definitely the place to be if you like to party and have a good time Clubs cafes and bars lined up next to one another and loud music playing in the street Liked the place a lot and wish to spend more time here Again in terms of safety it seems that there is relatively low crime rate in Seoul in general We felt completely safe walking these streets at night Plenty of taxis in the area and no waiting time to get one even at night
12098,3,We were here at 9pm and some of the shops are already closed From what we can see this area is mostly cafes restaurants and souvenir shops Not attractive for me but I am sure some of you out there will appreciate this place However plan to come early maybe late afternoon latest
12099,5,Definitely touristdriven but there are some shops that have real authentic goods that are great for gifts and souvenirs They are in between the more cheap knickknack shops Theres a hidden gem tea house down an alley way that cannot be beat And walk to the top of the shopping center for the poop emoji cafe Dont miss their pancakes
12100,5,A small street full of antiques shops Really a place to go while visiting Seoul Spent time looking at small stuff there
12101,5,We visited this place twice during our short stay at Myeongdong area We love the vibes here very pretty and charming and good for souvenirs shopping  The street is not very long but very lovely with shops restaurants cafes etc lining the street and side lanes By the way the Alive Museum is located there as well next to the tourist information booth  We walked back to Myeongdong area without much trouble although we could take the metro but getting up and down the stations some hard to find escalators were more troublesome Along the way we even had a short walk on the pretty Cheonggyecheon Stream too
12102,5,Though a bit touristy this street has a lot of charm and fun little handmade goods and art everywhere you look Definitely has a different vibe than many of the other areas in Seoul
12103,5,Althogh I appreciated the vibe of Hongdae I really felt more comfortable in Insadong as it is more laid back Still plenty of shopping available only without the frenzy
12104,5,What a lovely place to spend an afternoon We were treated to a variety of sights and sounds at a traditional arts and craft type village The people were warm and the food was great as well
12105,4,Walking around day or night this place is interesting A lot of place to eat are also aaound this street We really enjoyed it
12106,4,I liked this place because there are some street food souvenir shops and restaurants I think is one of the places you need to visit been in Seoul
12107,4,It feels like old and new blended into 1 place Insadong offers an unique blend of modern arts and crafts shops Can be crowded but that is the charm of it Try the food I like the dragon beard candy
12108,3,A long street of arty type shops selling independent made jewellery and other arty stuff for tourists Seems to be mostly independent run shops A few cafes and eating places along the street
12109,4,I have visited Insadong already many times Although it is very touristic it is always nice to stroll aroung on a weekend day and to take in the athomsphere Just avoid the typical tourist traps If you walk just a few steps away from the main road crossing Insadong you will find very nice corners and very good local restaurants
12110,4,Quite a quaint place to visit Resturants galore but its not much of a night life place Look to the alleys for hidden gems We chanced upon a nice bbq place in an alley and was very satisfied despite obvious language barriers
12111,4,Whenever you go to InsaDong youll find it crowdy but it comes as no surprise as the street is full of life and things to do art galleries places to eat souvenir shops cafes etc If you want to buy souvenirs this is definitely the right place to go to I recommend having a matcha ice cream at Osulloc and continue your visit in Bukchon Hanok Village located nearby
12112,4,Theres a lot of stuff for sale that probably you dont need Though its crowded its still worth checking out
12113,5,It s like a village with full of small shop Good restaurant  touristic stuffs ancestral writing and painting stuff small bakery and cafe it s a real pleasure to be lost and discover some courtyards and garden Lot of Art Gallery
12114,3,This is nice if you really need to buy an authentic souvenir from Korea At walking distance from Myongdong after the river
12115,4,A must go Insadong It is a cute little narrow shopping street with small shops on both sides Everything here is related to art and culture Shops sell items like hand painted fans pottery porcelain items clothes bags slippers scarves etc There are small coffee shops and restaurants Street food is plenty Hotteok was an interesting sweet snack made of dough and filled with nuts and coated with sugar and cinnamon There was also Corn cookie which turned out to be a corn based shell with vanilla Icecream They were quite unusual Some people were entertaining the crowds by doing some tricks I would definitely recommend a visit to this happening place
12116,3,Some really beautiful artwork pottery etc in upscale art galleries on Insadong but generally most of the stores were lower end souvenir or clothing Quite a few restaurants around
12117,5,Insadong has lots of souvenir shops You can find t shirts fridge magnet key rings purse scarf chopsticks and so many more They have very clean public toilet at the end of the road So no need to worry to look around there for hours
12118,4,nice place to shop but it is not that busy during winter loved the 10000won bag shop lots of options at 1 price
12119,4,Definitely visit stroll around get some souvenirs or clothsaccessories or get something to eat Visit during day time Cool vibe cool place
12120,5,Street selling traditional souvenirs represent South Korea in affordable price traditional handcarved stamp hand fan handmade pouch you name it We can see alot of people walking around in hanbok And dont skip the small alley you can find alot of good food here
12121,4,Shopping is not my thing however there were a few things here that caught my eye The pretty street is a bit of a tourist trap though There were abundant hanbok shops antique shops and many craft shops such as embroidery adorned boxes pottery souvenirs and the ilk It did have several nice looking art galleries which I didnt visit due to time limitations and in one side street a Knives and Sword shop I did however head off the main shopping street to explore the small side streets which I believe is called Ssamzigil These alleys had some amazing and beautiful architecture some of which were cafes and restaurantsThe shopping area didnt open until 10 am and some shops 10301100am I went on a weekday Worth a visit
12122,5,We went there for buying things about South Korea but a bit expensive You can find a lot of souvenir shops in Insadong
12123,5,Really enjoyed walking there with my mother nice small shops and restaurants but we didnt try any of them so I cant write my opinion
12124,3,This is a lively and interesting place to stroll around but dont go there expecting to find any bargains Most of the items on sale seemed to be fairly expensive and not difficult to find elsewhere in the world
12125,4,This is a vibrant shopping area filled with stalls selling arts and crafts and souvenirs There were food stalls in the area as well selling a wide variety of street food There are also heaps of restaurants in the vicinity
12126,5,I loved the feel of Insadong This was my fourth visit to Seoul and I have loved Insadong every visit There is so much to do and you should really take the time to explore all of the little alleyways too Lots of gorgeous little shops selling handicrafts and pottery There is also Ssamjigil which is a great little cluster of quirky shops and a few poop cafes dont judge  they were so adorable It is a really fun place and great for a laugh with friends or kids Or just some really immature adults Ahem 
12127,5,Insadong is a mustvisit place whenever I stay in Seoul You can find all kinds of souvenirs from the cheap mass produced items to the unique handcrafted ones Not to mention the wonderful restaurants along the small sidestreets of Insadong
12128,5,In my opinion this is the best market for souvenir shopping There are many unique art shops to buy oneofakind handmadehand painted works I bought a small ceramic oil lamp some paintings and a custom made music box among other things And the prices are very reasonable Its a great place for getting gifts for others too And there are plenty of the cheap mass produced souvenirs around as well Its an easy walk to or from Jogyesa Temple so stop by both
12129,5,This was a place I like with lots and lots of things to do and see and feel and taste and eatyou would need a couple of days or more just to be able to see all the interesting places and shops to visit But what I like the most is the side streets where actually locals eat and chillyoud need to visit to be able to understand the fathoms of this area a more cheaper area than Myeondonggil aswell
12130,4,One thing I like about this place is that its near the palaces and its not so crowded plus it has a public toilet hehehe Street food is a bit cheaper in Myeongdong as well and uf you want to buy some souvenir this is the place to be
12131,4,Its a lovely place to get art and craft items for souvenirs I got handcrafted hanbok cards and magnetic memo pegs for gifts at reasonable prices Just browse at the shops along the Main Street We also visited the Poop cafe on the top floor of Samsziegiel and enjoyed the novelty of it
12132,5,It was an interesting and pretty street full of shops The lanes were also very pretty with restaurants and more shops Insadong didnt necessarily sell cosmetics but other things too along with interesting and local street food Its a must visit in Seoul
12133,4,This place was packed at the weekend However it was lots of fun looking at the shops and street food stalls Its definitely catered for the tourists however its a fascinating place to be Especially seeing all the traditional dress shops
12134,5,Insadong is amazing Full of small streets full of reataurants and tea houses Highly recommended
12135,4,The famous street is really nice a lot of shops restaurants and Cafes but soooo touristic Its nice to see You should go there
12136,5,Insadong is the premier arts and craft stop in Seoul It combines just the right mixture of old shops modern art gallery museums and lots of coffee shops and eateries to make an afternoon of browsing shopping and eating out a whole lot of fun But be aware This area is also popular with the locals  so if you come out for a Saturday or Sunday you may be dealing with more people than you bargained for
12137,5,I love the street so much Its so relaxing walking there with a lot of antique shops around The street is not that busy and peak as Myeongdong and other shopping street
12138,5,A quaint and quirky area Ssamzigil to visit for creative and original knick knacks and handicrafts to buy We spent a good half day here And then had traditional desserts at one of the cafe
12139,5,A very pleasant area with beautiful houses and lots of souvenir shops We didnt buy some things there intending to do it later somewhere else But we couldnt find anything like that So dont miss your chance Enjoy it
12140,5,If you were looking for traditional gift or local hand made gift you have to come to this place its a well known street for hand made shop
12141,5,A cosy neighbourhood near Gyeongbokgung with many cafes traditional restaurants galleries and tea shops A good tourist spot to go shopping for souvenirs Had a delicious traditional snack in one of the tea houses
12142,5,Its fun to walk around this huge shopping street area for all different type of Artsy hand crafted souvenirs to bring home If hungry turn into one of the alley ways There you will find tons of restaurants
12143,4,Lot of souvenir shops around here Price is expensive Made in Korea products Popular with tourists for shopping
12144,3,Some souvenirs are made in China and the price is pretty expensive; some do not make any sense Yet the insadong street is quite good
12145,4,Be sure to check it out Probably one of the more pricey shopping areas but this is one of the most popular areas for street shopping to visit I bought a color caricature for 18 probably could have found someone to do it for a bit less outside of Insadong but the artist was nice and she did a great job
12146,4,This a lovely pedestrian precinct with lovely shops at all sides Some nice and some touristy Restaraunts are off the side streets Something for everyone
12147,4,This area has a mixture of antiques  interesting stores food outlets etc Really starts around 11am Some touristy traps can be expensive
12148,4,An absolute must for tourists looking for souvenirs and a love for quirkyartsy things which depicts either a new fushion Korea and artifacts depicting Korea old and new Pricey though
12149,4,In Insadong we found shopping restaurants and the kimchi museum A must do We also had fun visiting a temple and walking the streets Seoul is more hilly then I expected so wear comfortable shoes
12150,5,The wide carfree street awesome dumplings down a side ally sorry not sure how to describe location Just ask and lots of souviner shopping make it the perfect place for out if tien guests
12151,5,Whether you just want to stroll or go shopping this is one of the must go to venue Really enjoyed the walk with my sons
12152,3,The restaurants and tea houses are interesting Some of the shops are a bit tacky  typical tourist rubbish Equally some were more interesting and people are friendly
12153,5,We accidentally found Insadong when walking to Maple Tree restaurant The neighborhood was really cute and since there are a bunch of hanbok rental places everyone walking around is in a hanbok so its really festive to the eyes We saw a line of people in an alleyway so we got in line with them and got to eat these awesome meat filled fried mochi things
12154,4,Insadong can be reached by using the subway train The street has many souvenir shops The souvenirs were quite cheap as compared to other places but you still have to survey from shop to shop to get the best price Take your time no need to rush
12155,5,Lots of restaurants and good food Also cool cafes and galleries Authentic and enjoyable to walk around
12156,4,A great place to wander around Lots of narrow alleyways full of restaurants shops artoutlets Street entertainment and everything from bums to beatniks  all watched over by a discreet police presence A great place to visit if you like Las Ramblas in Barcelona
12157,4,Lots of interesting shops and galleries Plenty of authentic experiences as well as the inevitable touristy stuff Street food and local restaurants worth enjoying too
12158,5,Insadong is a great place to go if you want to see art and collectibles There is paper art pottery masks miniature collectibles and more There are a few restaurants around as well I recall stands selling fish cakes dragon beard candy which is cool to watch the process of it being made Tteokbokki and more There is a trick eye museum a city escape activity and a place that sells poop shaped snacks
12159,4,very nice for walking and shopping i like the atmosphere lively and friendly theres also a good cafe here and its near the main tourist area like Gwanghamun and Changdeokgung

12164,5,Came out here to drink makgeolli at Story of the Blue Star  cool little bar Neighborhood is absolutely worth walking around talked to a bunch of street merchants Good afternoon
12165,4,There are so many cafes and cool crafts located in Insadong area Its totally different from Myengdong which full of cosmetic shops Worth to look around for cool souvenirs
12166,5,This isnt the traditional market like in some of the villages or other parts of the city but it is perfect for souvenir shopping as a onestop Some of the shops also take credit cards which you wont really find at other markets around the city
12167,4,Ive been there with my gf the day was her birthday We had a plan to visit a specific gallery for an exhibition which was Brick Art The display has bee began in a couple of years ago It was a pretty good and quiet refresh Im highly recommended
12168,4,Insadong was the first place we visited in Seoul  We liked the old style neighborhood One main street with lots of foot traffic and small stores back alleys small restaurants and charm Insadong is more authentic and traditional than many other parts of Seoul Its small and one probably doesnt need to spend more than a few hours there to get a feel for it But compared to Myungdong Apkujungdong theres more character to the neighborhood Its also easier to spell  Nice tea shops arts and crafts souvenir shops In the back alleys there are traditional restaurants
12169,5,An emormous variety of shops and other places to visit Near a big temple too In winter hard to walk around a long time
12170,4,Not much to say Did some shopping and eating It was good food and good prices for the souvenirs It wasnt busy when my wife and I were there so it was easy to get around
12171,5,You can do everything here Shopping eating cultural experience all in central part of Seoul I always visit Insadong whenever I visit Korea Easy to get to and English signage everywhere You can spend whole day or come back for more Also Palace and Secret Garden nearby A must visit in Seoul
12172,5,Felt peaceful strolling around this area Lots of cute shops with craft gifls and fashion Its not as busy as Myeongdong and Hongdae Its just like a breath of fresh air Just grab a coffee and enjoy the walk you will feel great
12173,4,its fun to buy souvenirs here as you can see unique items from cheap to expensive ones you can also bargain depending on the number of items you will buy from one stall
12174,3,The place looked fairly plain which was a bit of a let down for a place that is supposed to be a hotspot of art in Seoul The shops sold mainly traditional souvenirs so it may not appeal to all types of shoppers There was also not much activity in the area although this could be due to the fact that it was raining when we visited
12175,4,Came for a walk  nice area for that as it is pedestrian only There are various art shops and places to pick up cute niche things We came for a walk during the day and had lunch before leaving Easy to reach with metro or bus
12176,5,We had great fun watching the honey candy being made into 16000 strings Dragons Beard and the candymakers are so hilarious It takes less than a minute for the candy string to reach over 16000 strands so be sure to watch it The candy is really delicious with a nut filling wrapped inside Isadong has lots of little shops and stalls and we had the best lunch there as well as a memorable time watching the candy being made and bringing some home The photo that I included is of the hilarious candymaker who asked where we were from then told us facts about each of our cities San Diego Seattle
12177,5,I love Insadong Lots of art galleries shops  stores and restaurants  Its bright colorful and a great place to take guests when visiting Seoul Easy to get to by subway and then a perfect place to stop for lunch and to have delicious although expensive tea at the Osulluc Tea House Ive been several times and am never disappointed with the trip
12178,4,This place was near to Bukchon and as usual all the beauty shops were also all around the area Somewhat similar to the other shopping districts so it did not make much difference to me I felt that it was less crowded in Insadong so there was less hassle
12179,5,Take your time to go inside the narrow streets and get lost within the bars and restaurants around Do not hurry just enjoy being in Soul
12180,5,Trendy smart young Explore Insadon alleys and you will find great cafes  antiques and hip coffee culture everywhere Interesting renovations of old houses made into cool designer shops next to noodle shops with lines of young beautiful people waiting for a bowl Take a afternoon and explore
12181,5,Best area to find cheap but excellent qualitysouvenir items Each stalll has different items to offer so better not stick to 1 store only
12182,4,We visited Insadong specially for the Poop Cafe at Ssamziegil Mall The Mall itself was quite interesting with many unique small little shops selling pretty little items The Mall was also designed such that you would walk updown the spiral walkway and you would walk past every shop We roamed the streets in the late afternoon for souvenirs The area was clean and conducive and many souvenir shops with similar pricing We bought our souvenirs from a nice lady the shop was very near Ssamziegil Mall and she gave us some discount We also ended up buying more souvenirs than planned as they were very nice I would recommend this place to visitors looking for souvenirs
12183,5,The best place to find unique souvenirs in reasonable price Somehow the souvenir sold here isnt sold anywhere else
12184,4,Beautifullylaid out street but nothing very special Just a lot of stores and coffee shops Instagrammableplace though
12185,3,Interesting place The alleys are full of surprises It has traditional tea house as well as modern cafes
12186,4,If you like exploring stores bar hopping sitting in cafes searching for antiques or memorabilia or even bowlingthis is a good neighborhood to explore We did not have a lot of time because of other priorities much to my dismay
12187,5,Insadongs main shopping street has everything you could want for souvenirs many of good quality Stop in Ssamziegil 4story shopping plaza just off to the side while here Its a ramped walk up in a spiral with shops off to the sides There are info booths at both ends of the main street closed to cars on weekends so you can get information as needed Lots of alleys to explore so plan for some time here
12188,4,If you look to buy handcrafts for souvenir this is the place You can find antiqueesque items as well as modern art pieces along the street  Therere also lots of restaurants
12189,3,Insadong is closed off to traffic on Sat 2pm10pm and Sun 10am10pm  On the Sat we visited we saw a protest group saying no to dog meat trade Interesting  There were also a few performances and I especially enjoyed the one by college students farmers music and dance at the end of Insadonggil near Tapgol Park  As I am not an artsy type I didnt spend much time browsing the galleries and souvenir shops Had planned to spend a couple of hours But left pretty soon as one souvenir shop is almost the same as another  Went on to Hongdae which I found has better vibe
12190,3,Came here on our first day of arrival fascinated by its creativeness amidst the tradition and modernisation Absolutely a good start for our exploration in Seoul 3500 won ice cream was one of the best here
12191,4,Its a reasonable walking street with some nice shops and products but a few will try to pressure you just step out and move on
12192,4,We found a few unique shops here but the majority of things could be found elsewhere cheaper Poop Cafe was cute with the top level having discs with devotions of love written out and tied to the railings
12193,4,Nice area to walk around and explore Lots of street food on offer A little touristy but still a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours
12194,5,Very nice area and cool place to visits Very recommend to try street food vendors Make sure to try fried dough with noodles or honey
12195,4,Insadong is a great area to explore and find some great gifts for homeThey have an information booth with people that can speak several different languages and provide you with a map and guidance of the area They have street vendors store vendors and an array of different items and treasures to be found The metro is located near by and the shopping area is fun to check out You may enjoy checking out either the poop cafe or the cat cafe
12196,3,Nothing much Every shop sell the samething Very boring area Just a street Once you cover area Buchok village by walk can go to insadong so convenience
12197,4,Worth to visit if you love collecting mementos dont forget to haggle a bit as some of the items are overpriced
12198,4,Went to shop around had lunch and exploring It was near the Jongmyo Shrine a UNESCO world heritage shrine
12199,5,I have written about Insadong twice so you can read those reviews to see exactly how to get to the Insadong area and location Most of my last reviews ares still pertinent today It can be very crowded but being a mostly pedestrian street some vehicle pass thru it can be as casual as you want to make it Gyoja for dumplings is great Starbucks is as usual very crowded on all three floors Many small shops with hand made one of a kinds and of course souvenirs Also try the finely whipped honey candy See my pics Enjoy it
12200,4,This place is one of the places you should visit if you want to buy lots of souvenirs They have a lot of options and theyre sold at a cheaper price compared to Myeongdong They also have a lot of nice restaurants in here
12201,4,Nice place to stroll through and browse different shops and experience different tastes Nice and relaxed and usually not too busy 
12202,5,This was my favorite shopping area in Seoul It was very artsy with lots of shops and vendors with items for sale that they made I loved the little food vendors too I bought lots of clothes and art type items here We visited twice during our trip
12203,4,Insadong provides distinct galleries museums and shops and a good introduction to Templestay cuisine It has good souvenir ahops and some alleys provide cultural shows music and exhibits
12204,4,I love Insadong I could easily spend 2 full days here as i love arts and crafts and there are also new designers artist etc etc For my next visit I will stay in Insadong
12205,5,On my visit to Seoul we stayed in a hostel right in the heart of Insadong We were at first unsure of the location but after arriving there were no issues What an absolutely beautiful place and a perfect mix of new and old Plenty of shops food and sights Truly a place where you can fully emerse in the culture To top it off there are great transport links all around but that goes for all of Seoul
12206,3,I come to Korea to enjoy the local culture not western culture therefore this is really a place not for me a short term visitor However I would presume there are more expats over here than anywhere else in Seoul I agree people here speaks better English than other parts of Seoul
12207,5,This is a bit of tourist trap at first But actually heres the place for you to appreciate the artsy stuff and traditional items of the country You can also enjoy the affordable poop bread and reenact the WGM scene at Miss Lee cafe
12208,3,This is promoted as a souvernirtourist gift street and its just that Nothing special many of the souvenirs can be found cheaper at eg Daiso however fun to stroll around and to see the little artsy shops
12209,4,I had fun exploring and picking up little gifts to bring home There were a lot of stores to explore There was even a parade  I enjoyed the caricature artist
12210,4,Its a walking street with a lot of stores and big varieties for shopping Pleasant street for shopping
12211,4,Loved strolling around here Its a very hip area and its never boring lots of things to see and do Worth an afternoonevening if your time
12212,4,This market area is remarkable with a plethora of shops of every description restaurants street stalls catering for up market mid range and bargains Exciting atmosphere Highly recommended
12213,5,Perfect place to buy souvenir in Seoul You find different thing from low to hi prices there Sometimes there area also traditional ceremonies there
12214,5,Great neighbourhood There is so much to see do and eat here I would plan ahead and map out what you want to do Lots of small alleys that have all sorts of little shops  guaranteed youll spend a lot of time here
12215,4,Would totally visit and explore this place again in my next trip to seoul So many unique stores and souvenirs to see Loved the atmosphere of this area
12216,5,A souvenir shopping haven plus restaurants It reminds me of Tokyo they have small alleys that hide the different restaurants that they have  We just tried one the restaurant out of curiosity and whala it did not disappoint at all  Would surely be back here whenever in Seoul
12217,5,Small narrow mazelike streets full of old houses and beautiful stores selling handmade accessories and many quality products bought gifts for friends here Food sold was great and I enjoyed dumplings and gelato Oh coffee was very good too seems qualified barista working in this area
12218,5,I love Insadong Very trendy and great alley ways with hidden bars tea houses and restaurants Locals are super friendly to foreigners and felt safe and looked after
12219,4,A shopping haven for those intending to buy souvenirs Shop around first before buying as it is cheaper when you are deeper in the alleys than outside
12220,5,So much to see in this area particularly in Insadong street itself Its full of art galleries and design outlets Arts and crafts abound  Excellent area to just walk about to soak up the atmosphere
12221,5,I spent several months intimately getting to know this area as I worked within it at the Fun Caricature booth Theres a LOT to absorb in the relatively small footprint of the area A quick walk from Anguk station or moderately easy trek Yims guest house where I stayed during my first visit youll find the winding alleys with traditional style houses offering crafts and souveniers restaurants and street carts a plenty Grab an ornate handmade blouse try on hanbok sample a sweet potato latte or get drawn by any of the supertalented locals or guests artists Pop on over to the kimchi museum to whet your fascination for the history of the fabulously funky fermented goodness or shop for skincare goods at any of the stores lining the main avenues One of the best parts about Seoul is how walkable it is and you can easily walk to Jongno3ga and Gwangjang market from here or check out any of the awesome temples or government buildings nearby I greatly enjoyed spending time in the area and would gladly recommend it to anyone planning to visit Seoul in the future
12222,4,Its a nice place to shop for souvenir items and lots of choices  It can get crowded too  Lots of cafe and shops
12223,5,The whole street is nice You can fill old culture with a lot of shops with traditional craft works All around you can find a lot and I mean a lot of restaurants tea bars and street food as well
12224,3,While there are some interesting things to see in this neighborhood the temple and the shops selling Buddhist goods most of it is overpriced items and food aimed at tourists
12225,4,We came on a Monsay at about lunch time and we didnt expect a traditional marching band was performing because it was a week day We were just lucky enough that we were there at the right time and got to witness it
12226,5,We found this area on our first day it was fantastic packed with little specialist shops hand made crafts and all sorts of interesting things to look at Loads of restaurants of all sorts Check out the tourist information where they have a place to try on traditional Hanbok outfits for a nominal fee they will even take photos for you
12227,3,If you want to buy souveniers better to go to this place Theres a lot of items you can buy here though the price is not really bad you can do both shopping and food trip  Walk from end to end there are lots of shop hiding on the sides sp make sure you go and check those small roads from left to right 
12228,4,Very touristy but still very much worth a visit Lots of traditional food offerings from street stalls and tea houses to higher end more expensive ones Also quite fun to watch hordes of people dressed up in hanbok
12229,5,I love insadong You can find any traditional stuff here Nice shops nice food Very crowded during weekends If you prefer a quiet enjoyment visit during weekdays However traditional street performance only happens during weekends
12230,2,We visited on Sunday as the Main Street is block It was supposed to have singing dancing on the street We were there in the morning at 10 am No activities going on in the street There were not many people walking either Nothing exciting accept the stalls sell different things compare to down town Seoul
12231,5,I went here with my wife Great atmosphere  narrow streets chic shops great restaurants Really a great place to stroll thtough and have lunch or dinner
12232,5,If you looking for the local arts and crafts here is the right place for you A lot of shops selling crafts here where you can easily finds and try the local foods also Theres a shop that u can rent the hanbok for photoshot
12233,5,Souvenirs in the thousands at reasonable prices in any shape and size Lovely shopping and dining area with tea houses and bordered by a palace and Buddhist temple
12234,5,This is the right neighborhood for those interested in art art supplies antiques and very nice clothes There are many shopping streets in Seoul but this neighborhood is unique We bought hand made paper for our daughter and an embroidered blouse for my wife Its also a great neighborhood to just walk about in and there is a beautiful Buddhist temple on the east side of the neighborhood Dont miss it
12235,4,Insadong has art shops galleries and exhibits restaurants offering a taste of local cuisine shops that offer local products and there are also various activities even in the evening It is a very good place to buy souvenir items
12236,5,As long as you dont mind fighting through crowds this is a great place to visit Make sure to try some of the delicious street foods on offer and check out the Jogyesa Temple located down the side streets
12237,4,We chance upon this place after visiting the Changdeokgung Palace Its within 15 mins walking distance Nice walk about where you can find local delicacies Less vibrant as compared with Myeongdong
12238,5,if you want to try wearing hanbok you should visit here coz there are many people wear hanbok walk around then you not a shame to do as they do and can walk around
12239,4,My dad and I decided to come here because of the reviews we had read Actually was a very happening place Many of the shops offered the same mass made souvenirs But there were some fun surprised like a hand made treat out of honey starch and almonds that looks very interesting A lot of calligraphy stores and stamp stores as well A fun place to take a walk
12240,5,There are many tourist souvenir shoos that really dont get my attention but mixed in are many authentic traditional handicraft stores selling wonderful handmade items Embroidery rice paper paintings inlay boxes ceramics and clothing If you look hard you can find high quality items not just tourist junk There are many street vendors also selling interesting small items and food Just north of this area before the bukchon hanok village are many excellent shops and restaurants as well The best pottery KWANG Ju Yo also a well known jeweler that also makes home decor items and traditional silver boxes and tea pots Samchungdong The streets get very crowded but are well worth the crowd dodging
12241,4,We visited Insadong 2 times during our stay in Seoul  both on Saturday morning We arrived there around 10 am All of the store were open but not a lot of visitors yet To me it is the best time to avoid crowds  The whole Insadong area covers a few city blocks with 1 main street and numerous alleys At the front end of Insadong there is an information booth We got a map there which helped us to navigate the area Some interesting places eg Kimchi Museum Temple Food restaurant are not on the main street The map definitely helps  There are lots of stores and 1 shopping mall that sell all sort of souvenirs and crafts Do compare the price first as most of the stores sell similar things We did not bargain at all as all things are with price tags All the people in the store speak very simple English  There are countless cafe snack bars and restaurants on the main street and at those alleys Price of most restaurants is very reasonable You can have a set lunch for as low as US7 Coffee however is relatively expensive compared to the food  about US4  5 for an Americano or lattee  If you need to use the washroom you can either visit the shopping mall or the information center in the middle of the main street
12242,4,I have been visiting Insadong for more than ten years While it has changed a great deal it is still a charming and unique neighborhood Lots of galleries that change exhibits every week so there is always something new to see Amazing shopping and the places to eat are endless My favorites are the little places tucked away in the side streets Unique jewelry in various price points This has become a very popular place with locals as well as tourists so can be crowded but worth it
12243,4,Wandering and being lost in the side streets and alleys of Insadong as we searched for eateries art and gift shops made for lots of steps but some interesting finds in this tourist area of Seoul We looked for some unique treats to take home and ended up buying a candy called Dragons Beard The sample tasted pretty good but wasnt as tasty as expected when eaten at home We found the biggest selection of souvenirs and gifts at Insadong but the nicest quality items were in the gift shop of the national museum by Gyeongbokgung Palace
12244,3,Insadong used to be one of my favorite places in Seoul Whenever there are new visitors from overseas I used to bring them to Insadong and they all loved it But recently the rents got so high and many shops which were in Insadong for ages moved out of Insadong Small souvenirs from the shops there now cost fortune Honestly Insadong is losing what makes it very special Its no longer Insadong I used to know What a shame
12245,3,I visited Insadong on a day tour We had our lunch in Insadong and the food was absolutely delicious After lunch we walk for 40 minutes to see the small shops I recommend lunch in Insadong because the food is ultra delicious plus there is also a very popular Ginseng chicken soup shop there
12246,5,Im really glad that our Tour Specialist brought us here though its not part of our itinerary I would have missed hanjeongsik lunch and other stuff that can be bought here at a cheaper price compared to myeondong though i didnt check out the cosmetics shop if there was any If you would prefer more food trip and shopping this place is highly recommended Too bad didnt get to stay longer due to time constraints
12247,3,suitable for those who wants to buy decorations souvenirs and art I am not much of a souvenir person so Insadong wasnt that interesting for me There was not much clothing stores to shop Unfortunately there was not much restaurant open when we were there because it was Chuseok Still the place was crowded
12248,5,We fell in love with Insadong the moment we saw the street lined with amazing local art quaint museums hip fashion stores beautiful tea houses and traditional restaurants that gave you a feel of being transported to another time in Korea The vibe too is amazing Its fun very eclectic friendly and casual Ssamzeigil a mall along Insadong featuring a pretty unique open layout design features shopping for every age with different price range Theres something for everyone here and even if youre just there to feel the vibe its definitely worth the visit
12249,5,One of the best spots during peak of autumn Falling ginko leaves made the entrance to the place really magical I am just not sure if it have the same charm if the trees do not have those dramatic colors  You have to explore the area to find good food A lot of souvenir shops too Although it was a busy street the whole area gives you a feel of their culture and arts
12250,4,Insadong is a shopping and dining street that is interesting to visit and take a leisurely stroll It is not as active as the Myeongdong area but well worth a visit We first strolled the street then went a few blocks to the Top Cloud Cafe which from the 33rd floor provided a wonderful place for lunch and a spectacular view of Seoul
12251,2,Considering its a holiday there were so many people in the area that made it difficult to shop or see the different sites
12252,5,Numerous art galleries cafes and restaurants Shops museums Lovely place to walk around but today also so many people because of Chuseok a local thanksgiving holiday
12253,3,Quiet streets depending on which part of insadong u r at Nothing much to see really Better visit the other places if u r on short time frame
12254,4,Insadong provides tourist shopping for the usual little things but it also has neat upper end studios galleries and shops hidden away on the little side streets mostly patronized by locals There are also all sorts and little restaurants to give you energy for more shopping
12255,5,The selection of small shops and galleries here cover most pockets and tastes and has some very nice things among the tacky souvenirs Search around it is worth it
12256,5,A place where you can meet everyone or look for everything  souvenirs antiques or even modern crafts A fun place to enjoy by just walk around or stop by for cake and coffeeThis is a tourist area so you know what crowd situation you will meet
12257,4,Antiques Traditional clothingfoodsrestaurantsglassespaintings drinkseverything Insadong are everything in korea for souvenirs Most tourists come and go in this place  A cheap and affordable hotelsmotels are also here  Sometimes an activity or performances are held here
12258,4,Had a fun time at Insadong Theres a lot to do and see There are shops for souvenirs and cafes We walked around the area and there were a lot of interesting things that you can do have a sketch of yourself try street food be entertained by food servers listen to musicians etc Its a nice place to spend a few hours
12259,4,Insadong has always been one of my favorite places in Seoul But nowadays too much tourist so everything seems fake Though you can find some amazing places hidden My favorite REAL AUTHENTIC tea shop and a few restaurants are hidden in the alleyways and out of sight Make sure to find those amazing hidden places
12260,4,It is a good place to buy souvenirs Walk around shops and observe the prices before you buy something the prices varies at the same type of products
12261,4,There is a market here where you can get all your souvenirs You can find anything here Try to walk around for a bit because the stores at the main entrance are more expensive than the ones in the market They ripped me off a couple of times with the prices for some t shirts I found the same tshirt in a few other stores way more cheaper
12262,4,Tis is a beautiful and safe shopping area We discovered wildly varying prices for the same items so shop around and THEN buy Carry cash because not all places take cards
12263,5,It is a nice place with small shops and cafesIt is a lively areaThere were lots of tourists and a very colorful shopsWe really enjoyed so much there
12264,4,Very cool location to palaces city hall and markets Many interesting restaurants and shops with local flavour All of th above are within a reasonable walking distance but thee is good access to the great subway system to be able to visit other parts of Seoul
12265,3,We came here using the subway and exited from Anguk station There were a number of shops dealing in art and crafts As we were not art lovers we just gave this place a short visit
12266,3,This used to be the area with many craft stores where the artists made their traditional wares and had a good mix of galleries and artsy shops But many of the traditional stores have disappeared and are filled with many newer boutigues Disappointing
12267,5,Seoul is a boring city nobody would deny that Insa is the exception as it is a quite authentic quarter with little restaurants and guest houses Go into the side streets and enjoy food in a restaurant there
12268,5,The whole area is beautiful Little alleys that lead to more and more restaurants and cafes Great atmosphere and a thousand things happening around you Food available everywhere Definitely a place to go
12269,3,It was very pleasant to walk around the streets but really hard to find any good food Ended up eating in really tourist place big mistake There are heaps of shops for souvenir hunting Watch out for the hills they are steep
12270,5,Close to the N Seoul Tower this shopping street was on of the nicest ones in Seoul Lots of vendors and everything from highend to market traders Jusrt a nice escape from the traditional shopping malls
12271,4,Very pretty area with excellent restaurants I got a feeling though that they may have different prices for tourists versus locals I only bought from those whose prices are written on signs so that I know for sure that they are not changed because I was a tourist
12272,4,This place is very relaxing despite with all the tourist and local shopping and walking around So many shops and food to choose I find it relaxing while looking and doing window shopping Try to go the a small mall where the poop cafe at 4th floor for an experience
12273,4,Its a street with shops and restaurants they also have art and exhibits My girlfriend recommends the massage place on the 5th floor see pic of there business card
12274,5,From shops to mini dining areas to a number of cultural attactions You really have to be here and experience it
12275,5,Love this area in seoul Very artistic neighborhood with nice boutique galleries and restaurants You can visit the Yogyesa temple
12276,4,Popular district for many good options for shopping and dining close to the downtown area Crowded sometimes
12277,5,Try to discover small streets around this Main Street with lots of small local restaurants try cold kimchi soup
12278,5,The real traditional Seoul culture You could spend hours or days just wandering the alleys and streets of Insadong and see traditional art paper calligraphy and culture
12279,5,a small street but sufficient for shopping eating and even accomodation a very convenient place to be at in Seoul
12280,5,We stayed in Insadong and found it was the best location to walk to attractions plus it was the best neighbourhood for food souvenirs and handmade handicrafts Food ranged from restaurants to street stalls  the best I would highly recommend anyone to stay here  we stayed at the Orakai Suites  fabulous
12281,3,Nice street to stroll in the afternoon especially after 2 pmas the buildings shadow cast on the street make it not too hot and pleasant to walk or have anafternoon tea there The street has a good atmosphere but nothing much to shop Mainly are souvenir stores for tourists There are a few of good vegetarian restaurants nearby however
12282,5,Place with lovely Cafes art and beautiful autumn trees in yellow to welcome you Although touristy but great place to hang about
12283,3,If you are the kind of person who loves to buy  souvenirs and some things from the place this is the place to goThe street is picturesque and you could find many celadons and little things to buy A place where one could spend one or two hours
12284,4,Found this area much better for shopping then Myeongdong More traditional goods and so may great little places to eat
12285,5,We were planning to visit Insadong for experiencing their tea houses as well as some interesting shopping in the area Theres a lot to see and buy in this area and the tea houses are a memorable experience Recommended for a short visit couple of hours
12286,4,I thought this area was pretty generic Just lots of stores and restaurants Worth going once while youre in Seoul
12287,5,I love strolling the streets here looking at the various shops There is a lot of repetition among the shops  you find the same touristy crap out front of every other store front however there are some fun gems hidden among the mass produced money sinks There is a whole building dedicated to arts and they have a basement level where you can make your own crafts This is not just for kids  I mean its aimed at children but Im in my 30s and I had a blast making my own soap and would have done even more fun crafts had my husband not reminded me that we had to fit everything into small suitcases that were already pretty full
12288,4,Insadong is a better place to shop and people watch than the crazy Myeongdong area It also has some great galleries with beautiful art Go and spend a couple of hours wandering the streets
12289,5,Sick of cheap crap or expensive shops you get in every city Then Insadong is perfect for you Lots of artist shops and stores with quality good as well as your ubiquitous tourist shops and excellent restaurants It is our favourite shopping area in Seoul It remains me of Portland with small shops selling select items Fun to wander through
12290,5,I love Insadong area because of the shop stalls along the streets and the street foods If you want to buy something for your friends wayback home just go and shop at Insadong You can just walk from Buckon Village and Gyeongbukgong Palace Just ask for direction from the people you meet
12291,4,Whilst the Insadong area is focussed on tourists it has many great little shops some with the usual touristy items such as tshirts fans pictures etc but there are also many cool little craft shops Along with the tourist shops many great food places have sprung up To find some hidden gems explore all the little alleyways and side streets Well worth a visit here to pick up some souvenirs and take a bite to eat
12292,5,This area is worth visiting as it features pretty and artistic shops rather than global brands There are good places to eat and it is a pleasant area to walk through
12293,3,Another typical shopping district Some travel magazines said it was somehow artistic and special but I did not think so or realize anything especially attractive
12294,5,i love the teahouses and small restaurants in the alley  very cultural place to visitrecommended  must walk into those alleys to find those traditional teahouses  guaranteed you would feel so different  away from the bustle of the main street 
12295,4,Pleasant to walk around and full of restaurants tea houses and art and gift shops of various types It felt a bit touristy for my taste but was relatively relaxed and a contrast to the big pacy centre of the city Be warned restaurants seem to close early here  we got caught out on our first night when we checked into our hotel from the airport at gone 8pm virtually everything had closed by the time we went out in search of dinner just after 9pm
12296,4,Its a mix between modern and old The side streets and steps are great to explore while the Main Street has a mix of modern and old Great place to eat and the metro stop is right there its worth a few hours or more to explore
12297,5,Nice place with old buildings restaurants and cafes are not big but nice and cozy They also sell small cute souvenirs
12298,5,I would like to walk around for shopping You can find many great stuffs here There are so many restaurants hid inside ally Donts forget stop at lovely tea cafes
12299,4,Lots of restaurants Street vendors and shops Convenient location near the palace My favorite stop was Dr Fish Pay a small fee and stick your bare feet into an aquarium with fish which eat the dead skin off your feet Tickles a bit but your feet end up smooth and clean
12300,5,My mother and I went here together and we absolutely loved it We had visited a couple of the other markets together and they were somewhat of a letdown because we werent really looking for that department store feel or the super back alley pawn shops that were behind the department stores We wanted the in between that was street vendors and street level shops with decent wares at decent prices and that is precisely what Insadong was It had great things to buy and look at and it was just a lovely place to walk around The street was blocked off so there was only foot traffic very few cars Just beware that the stores close around 830 pm or so
12301,5,If you can only go to one market this is it We actually went twice we loved it so much Fun people great shopping  great food It was wonderful
12302,5,Many would agree that this is the rafts and cultural hub of this fantastic city You could spend days here on end and never run out of exciting things to explore If you like crafts and tradition then this is the place Dont feel shy to haggle for a good bargain I got myself a jade turtle and a bronze tiger sculpture at a bargain There are also some nice restaurants here and there us also the Jogyesa tremble nearby Love this place
12303,4,Visited this street in May This market is one of major tourist attraction You can buy clothing souvenirs and food as well Walkable from the palace Dont forget to try Temple food restaurant in this area
12304,5,The Overall vibe for me is better than Myeondong Lots of Shops good varieties  very inviting store owners Array of street foods Lots of locals around youll get to see part of locals daily lives More locals than tourist
12305,4,We stayed in a service apartment minutes away by foot from Isadong Enjoyed strolling and browsing along the main street Discovered nice and reasonably priced local eateries in the narrow alleys off the Main Street
12306,4,Lovely place to wander around and get lost amongst the little lanes branching off the Main Street  This is the craft  cultural centre of Seoul so lots of little shops selling handicraft pottery souvenirs etc plenty of quaint cafes and restaurants too to satisfy your hunger  I really enjoyed the few hours I spent exploring the area But did not buy much as things seem rather overpriced due to its popularity with tourists
12307,4,NIce area to browse arts and handicrafts instead of the usual commercial streets filled with beauty accessories
12308,3,Its pretty near the main palace and the folk museum I went there for a tour of insadong and then went to the temple palace and museum Wouldnt go just for it
12309,4,70 minute bus ride from Incheon airport or easily accessible by the many metro stations nearby This place is filled with restaurants tea houses tourist shops bars and coffee shops Pleasant atmosphere and excellent base to explore the rest of city Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful
12310,5,Its a lovely street to walk oneat foodvisit tea houseshopping I went there 2 times and loved it so much I recomend visiting this streetalone or notits a experience you dont want to miss
12311,5,Walked around all day to explore Insadong Had a great lunch at a local restaurant recommended by our tour guide and enjoyed local dishes
12312,4,Primarily an arts and crafts street but with multiple shops selling the same thing or offering the same service  However there is a hidden awesome bingsu shop in this street
12313,4,We spent an afternoon wandering the shops in the insadong markets A good mix of real shops and tourist shops Good souvenirs and house wares can be found along with ornaments and many others things you can take home  There are street food stalls but I wouldnt say the good is the main attraction here
12314,4,It was only until it was too late that I made a mistake with Insadong  I thought the main street was were it was all at Wrong As well as so many interesting shops on the main street there are a lot of alleys with more shops Allow yourself about 3 hours to browse the entire area and dont stick to the main streetwhich I did
12315,4,Insadongsamcheongdonggyeongbok palacegwanghwamun can be grouped together They are all walking distance from each other
12316,5,I LOVE INSADONG Heralded as the Art Capital of Seoul this area is probably my favorite landmark out of all the places we visited last week This area is quiet without being boring and is lively without being rowdy People arent pushing you and you dont feel any pressure to buy anything Walk around and simply enjoy the ambiance of this perfect mix of old and new And it truly lives up to its name as the art capital because there are art galleries calligraphy shops and other art supply stores EVERYWHERE This is also a great place to buy souvenirs for friends and family because they offer the same things as other highly commercialized places for cheaper prices  Street food is also great too 10002000 won only  Mustvisit is the Ssamziegil Mall which is half mall half boutique stores This place is a HAVEN for Instagrammers millennials and anyone generally looking for something interesting in Seoul Tip The infamous Poop Cafe is here as well as the Wall of Love in the top floor  Other things worth getting here are the 16000 strings of honey wrapped around ground nuts like mochi cakes we bought our box from 2 very entertaining brothers and art supply materials if youre into painting and calligraphy
12317,5,This busy area is full of shops and restaurants tucked away in side streets We were there during the holidays for Buddahs birthday and it was buzzing with people wearing traditional dress it can be hired by anyone for a couple of hours or more Very colourful
12318,4,Not sure if it was the time of day around 3pm but we enjoyed walking around without the hustle  bustle There were beautiful ceramics And I bought myself an eel leather wallet  apparently only made in Korea
12319,4,Interesting area to explore to dine to people watch or for taking a walk especially after dinner Its a popular area anytime of the day with many choices for dining
12320,4,Discover many things are cheaper here compared to Myeong dong Quite enjoyable  I have green tea ice cream at a famous green tea shop there
12321,4,It nice to go to this place after a long walk at nearby palaces and hanok villages There are restaurants and food stalls Try some street food Then enjoy visiting some of the art galleries if you are interested about paintings  If you want choose some souvenir items here
12322,5,Insadong was a great combination of craftsouvenir shopping tea houses places to eat and galleries I have already had 2 fabulous meals there bought super souvenirs and had the best experience  which involved buying a new handbag and leaving all my jewellery in the old handbag at the shop Naturally when I realised I returned the next day; I was recognised on sight  and she raced to the back of the shop to retrieve not just my jewellery but several special pens that I didnt even realise Id also lost
12323,4,This is quite a fun neighborhood For the most part it consists of one big  mostly traffic free  street with some interesting side lanes  Also you can spot quite a good amount of visitors dressed in traditional Hanbok clothes  Compared to Myeongdong this is more quiet and has a bit more space to walk It is completely different also when it comes to the shops Most shops here are on the arts and crafts side We bought some nice kitchenware here as well And we were lucky to catch some traditional dance show free in one of the side lanes Besides that theres a good amount of interesting restaurants for good prices And the carts selling the boiled bugswhich is totally touristy and you wont find them anywhere except in tourist areas Theres also the famous Ssamziegil Mall which honestly was a bit underwhelming  It is a fun little area not far away from the palace which makes a good little walk But Myeongdong was a place we never got enough of and we walked every nightthis place here was fun But enough to have a walk or two  A mustvisit nonetheless  Wanna know more about me and my trips Check my profile
12324,5,I shopped in Insadong three times during my two stays in Seoul I loved the selection of handicrafts and the pottery selection was phenomenal Prices were very good as well
12325,5,We had so much fun in Insadong We went there several times when we were in Seoul My favorite restaurant was down a little alley way It was a dumpling restuarant Not far from the Trick Eye Museum They had sweet and sour mandu Yum We couldnt find it anywhere else in Korea We went back a second time just to have this wonderful dish We shopped for various things in the area Many tourist shops Everything was clean
12326,4,European style shopping area with lot of designer stores  Nice walk as well Good place to stroll and do some shopping
12327,5,Lots of side roads and a main shopping street  A few art galleries  And places to eat inc Indian restaurant  Avoid the cheaper eating places  the small of the food is bad  You get what you pay for  There is too much meat in Korea but there are some alternatives here 
12328,4,Yes a lot of repeated shops but varied Visited on the weekend and had some shows and bands Along with the shops had street food Walking distance from Hotel Lotte and adjacent to the palace You could combine a visit to the Palace and Insadong
12329,4,Just go strolling and looks for small souvenir for friends and walk in to the small food stalls and looks at the delicious food being prepared in front of you
12330,5,Fun place to visit Lots of shops and restaurants and walking distance to some historical sites We enjoyed our morning here
12331,4,We stayed in a hotel at Jongnogu near the City stream so could walk to Insadong for 10mins only There is a main street is Insadonggil which is connected to a multitude of alleys that lead deeper into the district with modern galleries fashion and teacoffee shops we realized that stuffs selling here seem a bit expensive than others area so just walked to see around and enjoyed the contemporary atmosphere here
12332,3,place where you can see different kinds of handicrafts and local souvenirs Street foods around this area is a must try too
12333,5,Great night life and buzzing atmosphere Go hang out around here for dinner and enjoy walking the streets afterwards
12334,5,Great and buzzing shopping area Very busy and full Lots of traditional handcraft and art shops to choose from and very good prices Great little eating places teahouses or coffee shops to choose from Recommend as a must on a visit to Seoul
12335,4,So many entertainment during weekend A street full with culture and arts Beautiful concepts and so many things to buy and adore
12336,5,Nice place to relax from cafes tea houses and restaurant This is a place if you like to chill and eat or even check out some souvenirs Would definitely visit again
12337,4,A simple and short street with traditional and nontraditional handicrafts cafes and snacks Traditional costumes can be rented here as well and is within walking distance to the grand palace Nice place to chill away a couple of hours
12338,5,Insadong is a wonderful experience The area has the typical tourist items but on the side streets are many antique shops galleries and restaurants tucked away from the main street shops A trend in Seoul is to rent traditional clothing for 2 or 4 hours Mainly teenagers are doing this There are some very nice silver and gold jewelry artisans on the side streets At one end of the street is a park with a 15th century 10 story pagoda incased in glass and steel The park is an excellent place to people watch and public restrooms are easily found
12339,4,I love the street food in Insadong a lot of dainty shops Traditional stuff are abundant in this area A good place for sightseeing
12340,5,Lovely rabbit warren of themed bars boutique wineries and preclubs I dont know much about Korea but Im pretty sure this is where its happening A younger seen ranging between mid 20s to early 40s with loud music and upbeat ambiance One of the best night outs Ive had in Asia ever
12341,4,This is a very interesting area which includes shops artscraftssouvenirs tea houses restaurants and everything in between English is limited but overall the vendors compensate that with their kindness However you should be prepared to bargain over the sticker prices
12342,4,After experiencing the pedestrianfriendly street of Hongdae Insadong felt more like a street made specifically for tourists Every store is a souvenir shop or a chain establishment of some sort and the majority of people there are foreigners Despite this it is a fun street to hang out for a few hours
12343,5,the place that i will come again if i travel Seoulyou can find everything includes fashionfoodssouvenir in this street
12344,3,Place to visit for local hand made products Simple street to walk through and not a huge market or maze to navigate Good to visit if you have time but not a must
12345,3,A very busy and buzzing street of vendors with interesting stuff to buy Most shops have the same product to sell however it is still worth a visit
12346,4,Its a must to go if you stay there Get your friends or family gather together and enjoy the nught with nice ambience and uniquely done restaurant Good place for those who love to take pictures  lots of picture
12347,4,Very pitoresque old Seoul street Nice little shops yraditional costumes some art galeries Local people stralling up and down I am shure you will enjoy it
12348,5,Beautiful crafts art galleries local food and vibrant atmosphere Great place to visit for souvenirs Best hotoks
12349,3,This is the place one would shop and eat although nothing is special about the place Lots of testaurants cheap and expensive
12350,3,Insadong street is much too touristic imho Of course there are many art galleries a lot of souvenier shops some restaurants and shopping mall located here but it seems to be more a kind of attractions for tourists I would say that much more atmosphere could be felt in Myeongdong district
12351,4,I enjoyed walking these streets looking inside these small shops and of course all the people watching
12352,4,Only spent 3 days in a hotel right in the center of Insadong Full of restaurants bars including a couple of Craft Beerrestaurants Much is closed on Sunday mornings but many open later in the day on Sunday People are all very nice some English spoken at most restaurants but not all 2 days exploring Insadong is more than enough time to find cool places to eat and drink otherwise not much else there
12353,3,This is an area with narrow alley streets with shops  restaurants Cute for a little shopping jaunt
12354,4,Another shopping street but different with more handicraft shops then other streets Not too long but interesting
12355,4,Perfect morning of shopping From flea market tourist knick knacks to art galleries and up scale shopping its all here Every little alley brings more to discover It starts to get busy around noon Something for everyone
12356,4,I spent a whole afternoon in Insadong in early May Enjoying watching locals and foreigners dressing up in traditional costumes parading along the street Lots of food stores selling famous local dishes  worth trying
12357,5,Very busy but beautiful Lots of arts and crafts to take home as treasures I got a beautiful hand stitched pillow case some cosmetic bags beautiful fans candies
12358,5,Theres a halal Indian restaurant but d flight of stairs was rather steep hence d vegetarian restaurant was d next alternative D food was very delicious
12359,4,Insadong is nice place to roam around Comparatively narrow roads but can do lot of shopping from high end shops to small shops Tourists can find many Souvenir shops and small eateries The whole area is walk able and well connected to public transport Happy travelling
12360,5,Really fun street with lots of shopping and restaurants Always seemed busy with families kids and adults alike We went to this area several times and always enjoyed the experience
12361,5,Great shopping street Wonderful boutique stores lots of tea houses and coffee shops Many foreigners as well as locals Fun people watching Highly recommend this being added to the Seoul itinerary
12362,4,Enjoyed Insadong Had some great food and picked up a funky pair of glasses from a local manufacturer of frames I would go back to explore more as I only had 3 hours during my visit
12363,5,There is a cultural ambiance with different stationery sold in the area The streets are very clean with various types of shops
12364,4,We came across a traditional tea house in insadong The building itself is hanoklike and the desert and tea are delicious
12365,5,A nice place to pick up a few little gifts or find a decent restaurant for lunch A gimmicky cafe at the top of Ssamziegil called Ddong cafe which has coffees served in little toilets Surprisingly it is actually a reasonable coffee
12366,4,We went with some local friends and they showed us a totally different side of Seoul This area is cheaper for shopping than the main drag but our friends cautioned us to look at labels since many of the cheaper goods were actually made in China Its a great opportunity to see authentic decor and eat at some nice restaurants
12367,3,Decent way to kill some time but all the shops are mostly junky tourist items It appears to have some nice cafes and restaurants
12368,5,Its a fun trendy area with loads to discover just get in there and get lost so vibrant with interesting street food vendors which offers different kinds of yummy stuff
12369,5,Greatly displayed stores mixed with bars cafes and restaurants in the allies It has a great vibe Youth couples and good old friends will find something to do here
12370,4,We walked around through a lot of shops and street vendors prior to attending the Buddha festival The kids enjoyed it and so did we
12371,5,Great boutique of shops and restaurants a good mixture to be with the local people Found lanterns  I want to bring some home and have a party with my family and friends to share some of cultural experiences 
12372,5,Had a great visit and walked the area many times Each time with a different purpose Eating one time coffee another shopping a third massage another and just passing through another It is great and safe Decent prices and good food
12373,4,This is a street that sells just about anything and everythingInteresting walk along this street with all kinds of street food and also can watch the stalls making the dragon beard candy
12374,4,Seoul has so many shopping market Namdaemun Myeongdong and this one is Insadong What is the different Insadong offers various types of things such as clothes watches hats etc similar to other markets but it is not spacious like the others The price of the selling products is more expensive compared to that at Namdaemun But the location is much better than Namdaemun
12375,4,Each time I traveled to Seoul I stayed at Insadong It is very convenient in location but less busy and noisy than Myeongdong Hotels are quite cheap in this area Easy walking to Changdeokgung and Changgyeonggung Palaces and Jongmyo shrine Good eating places including Ginseng Chicken Soup restaurant are within walking distances In addition one could easily walk to Cheonggyecheon nice waterfall to visit at night
12376,4,Not unlike similar markets around the world Lots of food trinkets and stores Limited performance art
12377,4,Although quite touristy Insadong is nevertheless an enjoyable and engaging area to explore Local craft shops restaurants and lots of street traffic on this walking street make Insadong a must see for any visitor to Seoul
12378,4,I liked the area there is it artistic and cultural lots of souvenirs and traditions products shops You can buy hanbok costumes from there You can join your visit and be after visiting the Gyeongbokgung Palace it is around 15 minutes walk or one stop by the metro
12379,4,We found the Insadong area particularly well suited to tourists There were plenty of souvenirs available that we didnt see in aaaaalllll the other market areas of Seoul Art houses and coffee shops and restaurants everywhere surprise
12380,3,I was not impressed with Insadong At first I taught this is a great place to stroll but my expectations was wrong Although there are a lot of goof cafes and hidden restaurants the place lacks interesting things that would appeal to a variety of interest
12381,5,Although this place is a shopping area its vibe is more chill and way too less crowded than Myeondongs
12382,4,Nice neighbourhood with alot of shops and restaurants on small alleys Very touristy though Constant car traffic on pedestrian areas is very annoying though
12383,5,Went to Insadong after visiting the palace There are many shops selling arts and handmade items Do look around before buying as some shops sell cheaper The hanbok rental is cheaper here and more designs to choose from Do visit before evening as they close early
12384,4,I was in this market a couple of times as it is fairly close to the Buddhist temple and to the palace It was not busy when I was looking around and it was quite straight forward for navigating purposes To be honest each shop as the same stuff but the farther you walk down the better prices you get in my opinion
12385,5,We had a wonderful time walking through the narrow streets and alleys Had a delicious lunch and enjoyed visiting traditional tea houses Would definitely come back if I visit again
12386,5,This place is great for window shopping or buying souvenirs Stop at ssamziegil for a scenic winding path of great handmade items At the top there is a photo sticker booth and cafe Definitely worth at least one visit here 
12387,5,Insadong is a place you cannot get tired of With flea markets on weekends this place offers you surprises as a great shopping destination for accessories and souvenirs traditional or unconventional The small alleys offers surprises on traditional architecture and great food Even Taiwans Cheesetella can be found at Insadong too A great place for shopping and I am already planning my next trip back soon
12388,4,We visited this place during lunch and most of the places were shut It seems you can see a lot of action at night in this area due to variety of pubs and expats in the area
12389,5,Insadong turned out to be one our favorite parts of Seoul It is a pedestrian area with lots of shops and restaurants More upscale than Namdaemun market
12390,5,Visited the Buddhist temple before venturing into Insadong Good to wander along the streets unfortunately the tea house we wanted to visit was closed until May but a great experience for visitors
12391,4,Everyone visiting Seoul should take sometime to stroll through Insadong Many of the merchandise here are local made  you can pick up nice gifts or souvenirs in the many shops here Enjoy the walk and if you can also rent a hanbok to wear The atmosphere is nice specially in spring time when the air is cool and fresh
12392,5,A great place for souvenir hunting and good food to boot We made the trip to Korea twice Went to Insadong shopping the first time the first day We realized that this time we wanted to go and shop the last day because it is great for the last minute items
12393,4,Really comes alive at night with plenty of street food and little stalls offering the cuddly toy prizes A good place to go to for food
12394,4,An enjoyable place to visit especially if you are passionate about antiqueslots and lots of great treasuresAlso has fine storesone particular store that comes to mind is called Araya Its a very high priced boutique mostly hats has some clothes extremely well made of high quality and very pleasing to the eye
12395,3,Although its touted as a popular tourist attraction dont go shopping thinking that youre going to find anything unique Mostly cheap tourist items Crowed and you waste too much time just getting there Look elsewhere
12396,5,i prefer this street  area compare to Myeongdong street i still can found some herritage building in this area
12397,5,We loved walking around Isadong It can be a bit touristy but it has great charm Walk down the laneways to find charming restaurants or galleries Great souvenir shopping There is a large artist shopping mall Where local artists sell their work Its all great Not far is Jogyesa Buddhist Temple Worth a visit
12398,4,Insadong is a very lively area of Seoul There you will find plenty of people walking along shops restaurants 
12399,5,Great place to wander around Vibrant and busy Lots of shops and restaurants Close to subway stations Worth a visit
12400,4,Great little shops and esp for arts and crafts and nicknacks Great to wander around and take in the vibe Make time to pop into shops and try the food stalls
12401,3,Touristy street  Good for people watching  Nothing much to explore here Mainstream touristy souvenir and art shops 
12402,4,Within walking distance from our hotel Went there to browse around and found the souvenirs to be of better quality Lots of eating places and cafes along the side alley however since Ive already had lunch had to skip all the food joints Bought an attractive made in Korea wallet at a reasonable price and am very pleased with my purchase  For good quality made in Korea souvenirs albeit at slightly higher price then elsewhere I would recommend this place
12403,4,We went here during our last day in Seoul It has a lot of restaurants to choose from and a lot of souvenir shops also
12404,4,A nice place to get food or peruse small shops Local items art street vendors and other places to spend time wandering and shopping
12405,4,Great walk around the area best linked with a visit to GyeongBuk Palace and the King Square as they are all within a good walking distance with great transport links to Dongadaemon after insadong if your legs can cope if interested I hopped on bus 7205  approx 6 stops and your Dongdaemun Shoutout to the tourist information centre  Area is crafty and mainly for souvenir shopping Possibly good photos along some of the alleyways  Not so great for shopping as most shops sell the same thing and noticed some of the items are over priced compared to other areas But def worth a visit if you link up a cultural day around Seoul
12406,4,I didnt expect to like Insadong as much as I did You can easily spend 23 hours here admiring pretty pottery and great handmade items Ssamziegil was eclectic diverse and impressed with amazing range of handmade items and quality Good place for souvenir shopping too
12407,5,A shopping street with lots of handicrafts just like what you will find everywhere across Asia However this place has a mix of young artists works traditional art pieces and also lots of tourist traps  I was here on a rainy day so it wasnt so fun but I can imagine this street as a nice place to stroll on a sunny day  Noted that therere a lot of nice restaurant in the small alleys along Insadong
12408,3,This street is a nice street to walk on and I suggest doing it on Sunday when its closed off It is lined with shops that are filled with souvenirs that are craft based Its a bit tough to tell the junk from the quality but with a careful eye you can see whats good and whats not There is a great craft mall not the super touristy one that has all this plastic wrapped stuff in it but the spiral outdoor one whose name is escaping me it is worth a browse and you can find lovely little gifts there
12409,5,Loved browsing the shops very inexpensive with great variety not too expensive even though it is aimed at tourists
12410,5,Whether or not you are likely to make purchases it is a place to visit in seoul Here is to find some local craftings for souvenirs  At least just enjoy some coffee or waffles in the cafes widely available
12411,4,Day or night the place is lively  Very good to walk lots of shops and eating places There are lots of Folk Cultural shops to buy from if u are looking for a souvenirs this place is for u
12412,5,This place is great if you want to buy gift to take home best prices and the store owners are nice and some of tgem give you a gift after you buy from them We also found an awesome restaurant were you can actually sit on the floor and eat plus it was 20 for the three of us and it was a lot of food
12413,5,Do not miss out on shopping great deals for some souvenirs when you visit Insadong Shop here for some non typical souvenir items
12414,3,fun area full of shops and cafes though it was overrun with people idly passing similar time on a Sunday afternoon We had hoped to find wider range of antique stores and a bit disappointed that shopping seems to be for knick knacks The childrens art areas and handicrafts were fun to see
12415,5,Beautiful historical place Best antiques artwork and souvenirs shopping place Really amazing one of my favorite shopping places Visited in Summer of 2015
12416,5,Cheaper souvenir stuff you can haggle hard to find money changer mostly filled with clothing stuff  you may find scarf jackets and parkas etude house face shop tony moly and missha and skinfood were some of the skincare stores
12417,4,Thus neighbourhood has a nice feel It is where the first post office was started Has a nice park  Topgol park which has a high marble tower which was saved from an old temple  The Main Street is full of lovely tea houses nice local design shops and souvenir shops  Good vibe with locals and tourists wearing Hanbok walking around  Nice spot to spend some time wandering around
12418,3,In this area there a traditional market selling everything here the food clothes souvenir household appliance including women stuffs
12419,5,Insadong is always in my toplist when travel to Seoul I love the walking streets handmade souvenir shops Having a cup of herbal tea is musttry in Insadong There are hundreds tea shop providing thousand kinds of herbal tea
12420,4,If youre a collector this place may be suitable for youthere were really great handmade crafts for you to buyi was there to just walk around and had a cup of tea and bingsu
12421,4,Its an ok place to walk around durring the day Some shops food shaks and some street food You cand find some nice souvenirs there too I guess its a part of Seoul and if you stay not far from it youll end up there
12422,4,The local vendor very friendly People here love Filipino Best place to shop for souvenirs Easy access on parking
12423,5,Invading is a fun and whimsical place to find out about cultural and historic things It is a very colorful place with lots of shopping with locals selling all kinds of goods Most people speak English and are extremely helpful Not pushy Good restaurants also
12424,4,Title of my review is meant to be positive yah Walking around insadong I see many nice things eg clothes food souvenirs etc I smell a lot of good food Even in the cold its nice to just walk around Maybe you can get some nice souvenirs or clothing ;
12425,4,Therere many local food and souvenir shops along the street with traditional architecture I was only walking around here nevertheless I really enjoyed
12426,4,A mix of touristy and local products Likely more expensive than other areas but were on a one day quick stopover schedule so limited our wanderings Nice little walk several side street restaurants Close to other attractions so a good stop There were stores with beautiful hanboks and traditional papers We also saw tea and traditional and newer crafts shops Make sure to stop in at Ssamziegil to browse the stores and have what tastes like bungeoppang sweet fish shaped red bean pancake but with a shape twist See pic On a cold day a single set with cocoa one chocolate and one red bean hit the spot
12427,5,Very quaint old world Korea streets and shops with great views of Seoul A must see while in Seoul S Korea
12428,4,Even on a cold February day the streets were crowded and the smells intense Many many small eateries and one aisle shops The shopkeepers are many and try to entice you but they are polite in their efforts Be carefulthere are cars and motorcyclesscooters on these streets
12429,3,We were told that this was the main market for souvenirs and traditional things We found a long street with many shops offering souvenirs or other art and crafts  not a real market and not cheap
12430,3,expected more as most of the stuff they sell is mostly junky clothes from China and things you probably wont buy
12431,3,This place is very commercialized as this is the avenue to showcase Koreas unique local products Prices as quite expensive as compared to other nontouristy areas with the same ambiance Quite a good place to walkaround and appreciate what the place has to offer
12432,4,I enjoyed Insadong more than Myeongdong as the goodies were more diverse Myeongdong is mostly cosmetics clothes and food Insadong had arts handcrafts and lots of knick knacks We walked its whole length and went all the way to the Myeongdong Cathedral and was able to compare both sites in one day I wouldnt say prefer one over the other its more like visit both Highly recommended
12433,5,If you want to find art or any unique souvenior come and visit Insadong This place also provide to rent hanbok for 2 hour only 10000won
12434,5,This is a great spot to pick up souviners for the family and to try some local street food Insadong is really close to the Anguk subway station so the location couldnt be better Plus its also in the heart of Seoul
12435,5,Loveee this place Its a good place to shop for souvenirs You need to bargain tho Dont forget to bargain
12436,5,A trip to South Korea is not completed if not visited A wonderful place to eat enjoy the local culture shopping souvenirs and spent a full day Easy access by public transportation
12437,3,It didnt live up to the shopping hype however perhaps I didnt spend enough time there and go into enough of the large malls around it  Had some good places to eat and the poopoo museum was there  Lots of souvenirs to buy but if youre also going to namdaemen get your souvenirs there save 10002000 won per item on average
12438,4,At here you can buy souvenir cheaper variety beg only 10000 won each handcraft your own stamping name in korea 15000 local dessert Please try the squid bbq 
12439,3,Its a neat area if you have a day to spend walking around but Ive never bought anything from the area except tea We ate at a Buddhist restaurant near by and I bought some tea from the OSulloc Tea shop in the area we visited Jeju and I fell in love with OSulloc until I read the ingredients Its a nice area very touristy but honestly I could have skipped it and dont plan to return
12440,5,Always worth a walk Cool boutiques and the Osulloc tea house a must visit Cool eateries in the surrounding as well
12441,4,This strip is much more cultural nice little shops selling gifts Great location for couples Ive been there twice First time was fun second wasnt
12442,5,This is another area my fiance and I just randomly strolled through while looking for our hotel on a Saturday A night market was going on and the street was so alive with all types of cultures I saw a lot of foreigners walking around Just a lovely walk through of yummy food cheap buys and a fun clean atmosphere
12443,3,If you are into shopping for small bricabrac this is the place Tons of small shops selling whimsical items Personally not my thing I have enough stuff I dont need more But still even if not shopping it is nice to have a quick walk down and have a look if you have a spare 12 hour more if you want to look around inside the shops  This area is where you will find the famous toilet cafe if you dont have time to sit down there are many stalls around selling poop waffles if your into that sorta thing not here to judge
12444,3,Some good shopping here but I still felt that it was all prices and marketed towards tourists The people are nice so that was good
12445,5,Lovely place its nice experience to stroll through these streets and experience the ambience even if you do not want to shop Some places are pricey but you would occasionally stumble upon unbeatable deals I got lucky with bags in one shop any bag at  10 and many of them were really good
12446,5,We stayed here for 5 nights in Seoul I would highly recommend staying in this area for your hotel Pros safe lots of boutique shops and eateries easily accessible to the metro and some local landmarks  Cons This area does not have late night entertainment or dining Most places were closed by 9 or 10 pm But there were a few places still open a bit later than this
12447,5,Some amazing handcrafted art pieces here Unfortunately there are tons of I Love Seoul type gadgets and other touristy things There are several restaurants just off the main road some in quite old buildings
12448,3,Whether its your first time in Seoul or repeated visit you would enjoy local screen on walking tour around Insadong where you will find many interesting shops and casual eating places
12449,4,We stumbled upon this place by accident and spent half an hour just walking around the little shops It is walking distance to myeongdong
12450,4,Cool place to poke around and shop Clean with a fun atmosphere Husband really enjoyed it There is a convenient strip of cosmetics and skin care stores A little more expensive than adjacent neighborhoods
12451,4,Insadong is the prefect place to go shopping for souvenirs The place is also filled with good street food and restaurants
12452,3,Place to visit to get souvenir mostly selling same items with some restaurants Price almost the same as well We were there during winter and shops closed mostly around 8pm by 9pm only cafe and restaurants are open So if you want to shop suggest that you shop first and eat later
12453,4,A really touristic place basically for shopping since it has a lot of souvenir stores of course prices are a little bit higher than other areas but if you wanna just try a little of everything at once is fine
12454,5,A place to shop for souvenirs do compare the price and you might get a great deal Some nice street food but its not cheap Beautiful ginkgo tree along the road Unique and pleasant visit
12455,5,A little traditional oasis in Seoul Theres a lovely man at a tablestall just as you head out of the subway who paints fans and banners his work is incredible and affordable Grab some tea and take a tonne of photos
12456,4,When we finished at the palace we walked down this street Loads of food places in old style wooden buildings Loads of shops selling souvenirs too
12457,5,Insadong is a neat area to explore There are lots of souvenir shops and some places selling true artistry If youre hungry there are many restaurants to try
12458,5,Our hotel was right by Insadong We had so much fun taking daily trips to the market for dessert and shopping My daughter had a fun time in the market with my husband She enjoyed eating the jcones of ice cream that they sell and looking for a new hanbok and souvenirs for her friends
12459,4,A lot of street food and souvenirs Go in the evening to enjoy the street food A lot of shops selling souvenirs as well
12460,5,I havent been there this trip or recently but it gives real old Korea feeling that I always appreciate I appreciate more since Im not in the country maybe SamChundong near KyoungBok Palace also gives the upper social decent feelings there I havent been there recently I wonder if any nouveau scenes are there but has strange old feelings there
12461,4,Stayed in a hotel nearby and enjoyed this area since there are many good local restaurants and plenty of souvenir shops Good for family travel
12462,5,Go crazy over all the souvenirs to choose from They offer souvenirs in bundles and you can even get discount and freebies if you buy in bulk Try exploring the whole district and be amazed by all the handcrafted items you can shop From paintings to clothes and small crafts everything in Insadong was very artsy and preppy Another thing I enjoyed here was the tea shops You can find OSulloc and other tea shops that offer different kinds of tea and sets to bring home to your loved ones or to add in your collection
12463,3,this place has a ton of shopping and eating stalls fun to explore and people watch even though it is crowded it is fun
12464,5,Dont be fooled by the usual description of Insadong being the gatekeeper of traditional trades The Insadong of today has plenty more than that The numerous galleries that line its streets are worth popping by for orginal works Nib into the many side alleys for lunchdinner and you wont be disappointed for sure We had lunch at a Vietnamese restaurant coz we got caught in a sudden downpour and we werent disappointed at all I cant remember hw or which alley tht is anymore But Im sure you could try and google 84 Tea Coffee Drinks restaurant and you should be avle to find directions If Vietnamese food aint your cup of tea look out for OSulloc Teahouse The green tea rolls are to die for

12466,4,look no further than to this place to look for cheap and nice souvenirs to buy There are lots of restaurants and shops with good food too
12467,3,There is one street here where there are a lot of souvenir shops There are other shops as well like clothes accessories eateries and etc There are many art galleries too Visitors can have a taste of local culture here and buy souvenirs before going home However the souvenirs are pretty much the same in every shop If you are pressed for time just go to one or two shops is sufficient

12470,3,Insadong is an area where there are lots of places to pick up souvenirs There are some restaurants and clothing stores here as well We decided to come here out last night in Seoul to get some souvenirs before leaving However buyer beware there are a lot of stores selling the same items for different prices We discovered this about 10 stores apart 2 were selling the exact same magnets but at different prices Also there are tonnes of beauty masque stores in Insadong Seems like almost every 5th store is Same deals too Gets boring after a while We did discover a really good place to eat though It was located in a traditional looking building along the left side of the street Anyway we spent a couple of hours here this included dinner in October 2016 and accomplished our goal and left for home
12471,5,Invading is not as trendy or cool as the Myeongdong shopping street but there are plenty of interesting little restaurants and food carts to sample as well as a wide variety of stores to visit We stayed in Insadong and so had a number of opportunities to visit the area
12472,3,This street is okaymay be worth a miss to be honest Some small artsy shops but nothing much else going for it Quite short so not really worth going out of your way to get to
12473,5,Great area of Seoul with lots to see and do the streets are lively and bustling and the alleys filled with interesting eateries and shops
12474,4,Different Many alleys and traditional buildings I had a tour guide and without her I would have gotten very lost The area is amazing and a true experience of Korea
12475,4,Strol along the fancy and hip shops and litle resraurants Nice teahouses It is an area with lots of young people When you are done it is nice to walk to the river they dug up the old hidden river and made it a vey pleasant walkway
12476,4,Insadong is very walkable and with many shops and restaurants The shopping center Insadong Ssamzigi worth a visit
12477,4,The place where you can buy souvenir and gift Near anguk station and jungak station from here you can walk to gyeongbokgung and bukchon hanok village too
12478,4,Cultural and food street Short walk up and down if not stopping for any sit down meal Shoppings and bakery stores can be found
12479,4,This is a great place to browse and take pictures of local food  great varieties of dried fish the sweets made from rice called cakes in Korea are an excellent snack  sort of like a moist energy bar There are several coffee shops and great small stuff to take home for presents I bought very good quality bits for my grandchildren at a very reasonable price All sorts of brand name goods sun glasses etc of course be careful of knockoffs
12480,5,Its is a vibrant street filled with traditional tea shops souvenir and clothesaccessories Had lunch in a vegan restaurant in one of the numerous alleyways
12481,4,Lots of shops full range of prices and was fortunate enough to try freshly made honey and nut filled pancakes cheap as but warning do not bite in too quickly as the hot honey will burn your lips So cheap so sweet you will enjoy
12482,5,Awesome to just walk around and soak in the Seoul vibes Plenty of shops and money exchange places Youll struggle to choose from the extensive range of ceramic gifts and knickknacks

12487,5,this is probably the place I like the most in Seoul Every corner of the street is just lovely in its own way A lot of souvenirs shops on the street with reasonable price Ssamgiziel is also worth to drop by for 1hour When youre tired of shopping  the street food is all around Try the chicken bbq  Some nice guys sell the candy dont remember the name  it is the Kings candy as they said They will perform how to make a candy right in front of your eyes  very interesting so after watching their show no one could leave without buying one box 
12488,5,This is me second favourite place to visit I stayed very near to this place when i had my holiday in Seoul Its a place where you wont go hungry or thirsty Theres restaurant and cafes around the place It is also well known for art and antiques This is a place where you should not miss

12495,5,This is the best place to buy good quality souvenirs at cheaper prices youll see a lot of people wearing traditional dress a must see place
12496,4,There were tall rise buildings as well as small shops in this area You could also get souvenirs and tea in this area Colourful and interesting place to explore when yo are in Seoul
12497,4,The quaint and yet buzzing streets of Insadong is a lovely combination in the heart of Seoul The place offers you local food options souvenirs and the people and the shops are really lovely I did not plan to spend much in this part of town  but could not resist the odd impulses from the local shops
12498,5,This was my second time to this artist district Although you can find the typical touristtype souvenirs you can also find locally made jewelry metal objects and artwork I just explored the main street as I didnt have much time but would have loved to explore the side streets where there were even more stores At night this area really comes alive with street vendors food and wares I would definitely revisit this area when I return
12499,4,A nice street with lesser crowd to visit with some unique shops unlike their more famous streets Have plenty of food options too
12500,4,Insadong is great just to walk around in even if you dont want to shop The street itself is cobblestone and the surrounding area feels very local but accessible to tourists
12501,5,Love the traditional shops Love all the food vendors We had such a nice time there sampling all the foods A must go and see for first timers Lots and lots of shops Ill be visiting there again soon
12502,5,When in seoul must go to insading to feel the city and korea Great shops and cool restaurants Walking around the area will definately bring you back again
12503,5,Insadong is the cultural centre of Seoul and where the Changdeokgung is We fell in love with the ceramic shops art galleries cafes and artisan shops Highly recomended
12504,4,A bit more modern than Namdaemun shopping center but has a large variety of shops and more importantly for me a large selection of eateries and take away shops  Worth a visit if you love shopping but i place this under Namdaemun and Dongdaemun because those places have more of the traditional market vibe i like
12505,5,It is the attraction which I would go back to any time of the day Vibrant interesting beautiful and calming at the same time Its a not to miss while in Seoul
12506,5,Shops closes as early 7pmSeoul time Additional given as a courtesy Thats small gesture  greatly appreciated  Bought some handmade nuts snacks  they are really nice Being the boss herself she really does it from start to tending business cleaning up A friendly lady who speaks basic English  Mandarin Her enthusiasm is attractive A very positive energy that makes her very approachable  A nice place for getting from souvenirs to beauty to your appetite Walking distance from Myeongdong
12507,4,The entire area surrounding Insadong Gil is an excellent place to wander around discovering little trinket shops cool restaurants souvenir places and colorful back alleys Definitely worth a visit
12508,4,Interesting place with this lovely combination of old times dwellings with modern life stuff A very international street so when I was looking for some places the foreigners would pont me that place out  Lots of restaurants and places to relax I found here quite cheap lodging and it was good even by the local standards
12509,5,Very happening international area in Seoul Had fun walking the back alleys amidst restaurants and bars Good for lower cost lodging and hostels
12510,3,Insadong is a pedestrianized shopping area consisting of a main street and several alleyways It is a touristy area and there are a number of art and antique type shops as well as the usual souvenir shops There are a number of restaurants and coffee shops It is worth a stroll but it is not really ideal for serious shopping
12511,3,Insadong is a market where you can buy lot of things mainly lokal art and handcrafts Its a morse spectacular market than myengdong with plenty more things to buy and a different type of local food try The dragonbeard its a kind of bread that they are making to look like a beard and they wrap different types of nuts in its a nice things to try
12512,5,It is just as like other shopping streetshave local foodstraditional sourvenir shopsgalleriesyou can walk along the street if you want to for me no cheap sourvenir there gudluck guys
12513,3,This area is a little bit crowded with some cloths shops and other stuff that you can find everywhere It is not a must see area unless you have some spare time to spend
12514,5,While walking along this street u will find shops selling more accessories and local designer clothings Its quite different from other shopping streets U will find Ssamzigil Insading which is a small building with many small shops selling interesting goods Worth to visit for different feel
12515,3,Good place for serious art lovers but touristy price Good for a walk and eat I just recommend to eat on restaurant when you wish to use restroomtoilet At the time I used the restroom toilet tissues were piled up on trash can and has wet flooruuugghh Looks like no one regularly maintains thembut they call this tourist place
12516,4,arty area full of small galleries and art shops  the best lots of independent shops and food experiences to enjoy
12517,4,Some items are a bit pricey great variety of food Great for late night strolls with friends and its also a great place if you want to buy some souvenirs
12518,5,Of all shopping place in seoul i love insadong the most It is convenient and beautiful Found some antics there which is a great find The shops sell unique items that i couldnt find anywhere else
12519,3,Nothing much to do there If you have some time to spare then visit If not just go somewhere else Antique Not that many Art Not that impressive
12520,4,Great place to get arts and crafts of Korea So many different types of goods are available We probably would have gotten lots more if not for self limits
12521,4,Its a short street really and all you can here is buy souvenirs Its still worth going if its your first time in Korea though
12522,4,The natives arent too interested in this spot but as a tourist I love it I love the quaint old buildings narrow old streets and fun shops with a variety of goods from cheap souvenirs to nicer art and handicrafts A great place for souvenirs some good eats and teahouses We were traveling with family native to Seoul who didnt want to spend that much time there I would have wanted to spend more time browsing the antique shops and old book shops
12523,5,Love the place So many interesting stuff to see This is where I rented a Hanbok for 15000 won for 4 hours I also had my illustration drawing done here for 15000 won too There are so many cute and cheap finds here Their 10000 won backpacks and bags are the IN thing now in South Korea
12524,4,I always enjoy going to InsaDong for getting gifts for family and friends We have a few paintings and carvings from this area and I got two more this time Many nice places to eat and some hidden tea gardens that are super relaxing Definitely hit up InsaDong if you want to get some nice gifts a good bite to eat and chill out at a tea garden
12525,5,The best place in Korea to shop at really cheap prices for local souvenirs and local and international ethnic food
12526,5,Lots of shops and eating places Lots to look at It appeared to be clean and safe to wander around in but easy to get lost as I did Not to difficult to find yourself again though Good place to spend a few hours wandering aimlessly just taking in the sights and sounds
12527,5,I like this place as this is full of life People are going to places with traditional clothes and very charming The areas feel very alive and many tourists enjoying all kind of shopping and other activities Good place looking for art pieces food and hang out There are many attractive places to go and see and definitely good for shoping shopping and shopping Recommended
12528,3,you can get some shirts and food and its not bad for a tourist area its not cheap but nice to walk around at in the evening
12529,5,Traditional tourist area great shopping and sights local crafts and fashions paintings textiles  anything you could want Wonderful place to spend several hours and dollars and a must when visiting Seoul
12530,3,It is a nice spot to go to if you feel good wandering with the tourist herd There are a lot of shops selling souvenirs but these are much more expensive than in the markets for locals where you can get basically the same stuff There are some design and art shops offering quite nice and special things but the prices were special as well I only went window shopping  Insadong is recommended for people looking for antique pieces yes there are a few shops selling SOME antique stuff Most things are fakes and some of the fakes are incredibly good fakes The best indicator for real antique pieces is a really ridiculous price tag however some fakes had the same prices For antiques or something looking like that I recommend the shops near the Seoul Folk Flea Market there you find the same fakes and some real antiques for less than the half price
12531,5,I give 4 thumbs up for insadong I love shopping here Good place good products For tips you can buy I love korea shirt for cheap n best quality and full emboss than other shopping place Around 57
12532,4,Visited here for another walkshoppingpeoplewatching An art lover This place is perfect The street are full with people and the shops offer many crafts and souvenirs pricey compared to Namdaemun Market This area also has few art galleries but unfortunately during my visit few galleries were closed to prepared for next exhibitions Theres also hanbok rental in this area if you wanna experience the feel of wearing hanbok and walk on the busy street
12533,4,You will feel so much youth vibes here So many restaurants cafe shops and cosmetic shops also fashion shops that will make you happy But for some reason i think the souvenir shops here sell souvenirs with very high place compare to other market I prefer buy souvenirs in other place like Dongdaemun or Myeongdong
12534,5,Insadong is slightly different from other shopping streets EhwaMyeongdongDongdaemunHongdae as it sells more of handicrafts art pieces etc Its a lovely place to shop 12hours around at It is also accessible by metro alight at Anguk station Exit 6
12535,5,You should try to walk their both morning and night time late one Many street artist sing and dance at night It will be a different experience
12536,5,We explored this area on our last day and loved it Great shopping for local items in a less chaotic way than the larger markets
12537,4,I really enjoyed my visit to InsadongThre main street is lined with shops selling traditional goods and many restaurantsMy advice is dont just walk down the main streetgo into the little alley a fins unique shops and galleriesStreet food here is priced cheaper than MeyongdongCheck out the shops selling traditional bronze and brass items you will find some very interesting things to bring back homeAt night the streets becomes alive with a lots food vendors and bars
12538,4,We love the cat cafe here The cats were very friendly and didnt mind a two year old We also ate lunch here at a restaurant that was located down a set of stairs and it was a hidden gem Dont be afraid to explore this area People seem very friendly and helpful
12539,5,I really enjoyed shopping in Insadong Ive heard complaints about there being nothing but cheap mass produced souvenirs There are a lot of those shops but if you look closer and pay a little more attention you can still find older artisan shops and antique stores We found some really wonderful gifts and souvenirs that are specific to Korea
12540,4,Lots of shops selling vintage or odd things Some were selling traditional clothes and souvenirs It was nice to see a mix of old and new things Lots of restaurants too
12541,5,I like insadong it has a mixture of old and new There are plenty of eateries and the street food are cheaper than at Myeongdong shopping street It is a must visit when in Seoul
12542,5,Lots and lots of tiny shops crammed with stuff that you dont need but bring home anyways I buy a coffee mug on every trip and the one we found here may be one of my all time favorites The salespeople arent overbearing just friendly Prices seemed pretty good and the selection was nice
12543,5,Very much impressed by the traditional tea shops Great looking and the teas and snacks are great as well
12544,5,We spent most of our time here if we werent visiting other sites Good culture place took kimchi making lessons at kimchikan here bought souvenirs here note  some are even cheaper than in myeongdong good food 
12545,5,We went there three times as the street has such a charm Full of art shops and people We bought all the souvenirs from there
12546,4,Perfect for afternoon stroll souvenir and gift shopping combined with great food and drink experience Like many places in Seoul food here is amazing Prices are fair
12547,5,Visited here when we wanted to shop Lots of arts and crafts shops The Ssamzi mall is here to just as you walk in on the street on your left Fun to walk down the side streets looking at all the different restaurants A must see
12548,4,The place is like Petaling Street at Kuala Lumpur Malaysia a place where you can buy souvenirs craft and arts for friends Nothing extraordinary the streets are just like any normal street in the nearby area Prices can be varied depending on your bargaining power
12549,4,Its a local shopping street I recommend it for people that likes to see other cultures             
12550,3,It is nice but in my opinion it is a bit overratedYou can find cheaper stuffs in Namdaemun The Ssamjigil inside Insadong is more interestingHowever goods are more expensive there too
12551,4,This area is for tourist there are a lot of cafes restaurants and shops for souveniers nice to walk around stop for drink or food a lot of peopletourist
12552,3,Our hotel was just of Insadong so we strolledwalked by every evening It is a lively mix of eateries  coffee shops and shops but nothing exciting
12553,5,sipping hot ginger tea in a tea house one floor above made for coolness peace and great people watching
12554,5,Really liked this areaespecially all the little alleys with lots of small restaurants Best place for buying souvenirs for sure as it offers the largest choiceFound a tiny place serving fried dumplingsfantastic for a quick and cheap lunchThere is a kind of a shopping mall with shops offering quirky handmade items very colourful and fun
12555,4,We went in the morning so the place was fairly quiet mostly locals and students minimum tourist Enjoyed the nice morning walk many souvenir shops around Would recommend this place if you have spare time but dont come to the area specifically for it
12556,5,Great collection of shops and restaurants My daughter found great interest in a music shop that had exclusive collections and music memorabilia she has not see seen before Also the kim chi pork stew was great
12557,5,it was a perfect Sunday stroll at around lunch time I started from Tapgol Park just off the Jongro 3 Ga bus stop nearby which is worth visiting if you are coming to Insadong anyways then walked Insadonggilroad towards Buckchon Hanok village Not too many tourists loads of cute little shops and the restaurants Perfect shops for gifts Definitely recommend to explore little alleyways and find ur little gems I followed a tiny sparrow that just flew by and found myself in a beautiful traditional vegetarian restaurants alleyway Public wifi pretty much everywhere so your smart phone maps will save you from getting lost Tourist information is at the Insadong road if you need someone to ask questions Definitely recommend to do Insadong and Hanok Village together on the same day East walk A perfect Sunday stroll
12558,3,I visited in midnoonIt was very crowdedEarly October is very crowded When the overlap with the Chinese holidays and very crowded
12559,5,Make sure you go down insadong 10 and turn left down on the right is a shady tea garden with 6 local art galleries showing painting pressed flower art textile art and photography rotating every week or so Also further back around insadong 5 or 7 the knife and sword museum enter for 1000 won donation Fantastic restaurant in the basement of the double yellow upside down yy building Open from 10am most closing around 89pm
12560,4,Interesting streets and allies filled with small shops and restaurants There are many popup vendors selling foods and trinkets Its like many other markets around Seoul but different Good for souvenirs snacks and walking about
12561,5,A great area to explore Many great restaurants and shops We went here a couple of nights and still didnt see everything
12562,4,Yes it does contain some little alleyways but I would not say that InsaDong is not quaint By and large it is a busy shopping and restaurant area
12563,3,Cheap bargain shopping area Crowded place Mainly street shop Lots of food outlets Credit cards are accepted in most places in Seoul but if you want to shop in this area take cash You may not find money changer booths instead you need to change your money in banks Time consuming You can also change money in hotels but rate is not so good Better you change money at the airport Saturday and Sundays are bank holidays so if you need cash there is no way to change in hotel 
12564,4,You might still find it in this area Spend at least an hour browsing the stores restaurants and little streets I enjoyed the antique clock and watch store on the main street They carry a good variety of vintage watches
12565,5,First time to Seoul and really enjoyed walking the streets of Insadong A must for any first time visitor
12566,4,This is another shopping street but has a more artsy vibe Lots of the usual gimcrack souvenirs but there are also places selling paintings hanbokinspired clothes handmade silk products or wood carvings not to mention quirky cute items
12567,4,Bad for the guys as there are a multitude of shops selling everything from garbage to new antiques The rain was a problem so you had to enter the stores We loved it
12568,3,Like most cities this is one of Seouls traps Its nice but nothing to write home about Easy to get to by metro with many eateries  also if you into set good expensive place for supplies
12569,5,This part of Seoul has many high quality shops that have beautiful and authentic items Even if you can resist buying its a great place to wander
12570,5,At first  you can find many locals theretoo they seemed to enjoy the place It has many traditional cafe restaurants souvenior shops art craft shops handcraft shops etc I love Osullok green tea house most where you can buy green tea products and order green tea desserts I ate green tea cake and latte with my family I loved it a lot   I and my sister still want to eat these so miss them
12571,4,An afternoon well spent at Insadong  browsing art and craft supplies eating kings sweets and listening to their hilarious song and watching various artisans at work Funky area and plenty of unique things to buy would highly recommend this area
12572,2,this place for handicraft and souvenirs shopsyou can buy what you need from handicraft and souvenirs  but for me we got disappointed because we going to insadong at night 9 pm and we thought the market still work but we got only a few shops still open so dont visit this place at night 
12573,3,We were a little bit tired but bought some nice cheap bags there is a shop that has unified price 10 000 for all bags; nice models  of course not excellent quality but nice variety and shapes  Finally we ate at a near buy mcdonalds shrip burger as we need halal food There were an indian restaurant claiming halal food but we didnt prefer it since it sells wine and beer so not trustworthy as halal food seller
12574,5,Insadong is my favorite area of Seoul There are a lot of tiny shops Tea salons and the required street vendors Several coffee shops are along the Main Street as well However where the areas shines is the art exhibition spaces Insa Art Center being one of the better ones  You can run into Buddhist monks from the nearby temple artists tourists from all over and even people who will write your name in Chinese calligraphy on paper fans anything handy  Check out the stationery stores Buy some postcards of kpop stars Try some bondaeggi Watch the guys making the royal candy Its a fun place to spend the day Around the corner is a palace see the changing of the guard and a temple  light some incense and the business district
12575,3,Great location near the palace and palace museum  an easy walk between the two Lots of cafes and small restaurants on this street There were more souvenir shops than I would have liked but also some nice shops and some DIY artcrafts places Looked fun foe kids who will be in Seoul for a longer period
12576,4,It becomes my favourite street stall It is from the direction of Jongno3ga to enter Insadong The lady has so much patience to grill the skewer We had 3 sticks on that day
12577,1,I and family did not like this market We waist our time there There are no good shops there Most of shops are empty
12578,5,This is a great fun street with food and interesting shops not just tourist trinkets but Korea has a lot of old stuff shops that are really fun to go through for those one of a kind things It is easy to come to this street more then once
12579,4,Lots of choices and some nice hotels in the area Only thing really lacking were public garbage cans which led to more street litter
12580,3,There are a lot of antique shops here There are also several souvenirs shop but they are a bit pricey than Namdaemun I went here just for sightseeing the whole street is cool and calm as not much crowd is here compared to Namdaemun We found shops selling bags for 10000 won There are some decent bags available
12581,4,Insadong is a cool nieghbourhood in Seoul with one main street for shopping and dining We walked through the main street from Jongmo 3 station on the way to Bukchon Village Worth the detour
12582,5,If this is your first or even second time in Korea I highly recommend visiting Insadong Is it touristy Yes but still a great district where you can buy traditional souvenirs eat traditional food and try traditional tea  Also there are a lot of volunteers wearing all red You can ask any of them for help I also recommend exploring some of the more hidden restaurants and tea shops that are in alleys or basements  5 stars Go
12583,3,There wasnt really much to do Many shops sell souvenirs but more expensive compared to places like Namdaemun market If you are interested in traditional shops this street might be something for you There are many tourists here and also many brand named shops
12584,5,A lovely shopping center which no need to walk by stairs but you can from ground floor walk to roof garden area Amazing area for shopping and a lot of native goods and foods You can go their by metro at station Anguk exit 6 then walk about 2 min
12585,5,What a quaint lovely shopping street Lots of cafes restaurants souvenirs and interesting shops Easy to access One of my very favorite places in Seoul
12586,4,Insadong is a great area to explore take photos browse for souvenirs or just take a break from the day There are lots of cozy little restaurants and bars  so much to see and do Dont miss Insadong on your trip to Seoul
12587,5,We loved the cultural street so much we were back 3 times during our stay Great shopping and food and atmosphere
12588,5,This walking street is chock full of everything from inexpensive souvenirs to lovely clothes and jewelry Down the side alleys are many restaurant options
12589,4,Insadong is famous street to both locals and tourists We went to Insadong on the weekend evening the street was full crowded but I felt very excited and energy fully There are a lot of shops which sell vary of things as antique art galleries and traditional stationery If you want to buy some presents for friends and family you should go to Insadong many lovely souvenirs In general you can buy at a small lower than the price offer of sellers
12590,3,Insadong is a small area at Anguk station Our group had kids and teens Therevis enough to keep kids and teens happy It is however a comercial area and filled with shops and eateries We spent a nice two hours walking around on a cool august afternoon
12591,4,A slightly different shopping experience as it has more artsy type of shops rather than your usual Street shops selling tshirts and shoes Plenty of dessert and novelty shops which can be interesting
12592,4,So many place that you can go in insadong There are so many shop restaurant and u can find for souvenir here

12595,5,It is a nice place to shop eat and be happy during summer  If you enjoy shopping this will be a nice place with a blend of old and new style
12596,3,Many shops sell souvenir items However the most interesting shop Ive ever seen was a Poo Museum in one of the plazas It was basically an indoor play area for kids with a poo theme Very bizarre but funny
12597,4,I got many cute fridge magnets and many arts galleries surrounding this area Have a slow walk of a day sure you will get something interesting handycraft to bring back home
12598,4,Good street for souvenirs and handicraft shopping We were here in the afternoon after visiting Bukchon area Its a lively place
12599,3,Insadong has changed a lot It was a quiet and cultural quarter some ten years ago with old shops selling writing brushes traditional paper and boutiques artful handmade products Nowadays new shopping centre and restaurants opened it is more lively but too touristy sadly
12600,5,Excellent night life phenomenal street food good hiking areas nearby great for shopping perfect for couples
12601,4,its a great place to buy souvenirs you have different choices there are some coffee shops also there are a small mall called ssamziegil it has a great small shops and in the first floor they have a poop cake you should try it
12602,5,lot of souvenirs and cafes on this street walking street only so it was a really nice escape from the busy streets of Seoul We tried o sulloc tea house with great matcha ice cream latte matcha and cake Would recommend to try if you are a matcha fan 
12603,5,This really is the best place to buy arts and crafts whilst in Seoul We shopped around and made a point of returning to Insadong because the choice was by far the best There is always something to see  make sure to explore the side streets where excellent restaurants and tea houses can be found There are bargains to be had because competition between outlets is fierce We haggled  politely but firmly and got some excellent bargains
12604,5,One of my favorite place to visit on all my trips to Seoul is Insadong I love the atmosphere here and theres so many shops around for all your shopping needs be it cosmetics souvenirs handicrafts food clothes accessories etc anything and everything  The streets are also not overly crowded and theres lots of traditional elements around its very artistic Sometimes you can also spot street performances  The food shops here are also great lots of traditional and modern eating and drinking places too many variety to pick from Its really a great place to hang out for hours and never get bored
12605,5,I have meet my private tour guide from a web call TravoAsia Kim was a very nice Korea girl who born locally in Seoul She bought me to this area and took me to lunch there I was surprise by the shop and food that she brings me There are many hidden place to visit around this area Highly recommend that you have a local to bring you visit around Have a lovely day Thanks Kim
12606,3,This area was too touristy for mebut its busy and full of tourist shops and an easy walk from either of the two big palaces
12607,5,The neighbourhood is full of quirks and surprises Good very traditional as well as the hipster things to do
12608,3,If you are first time visitor to Seoul or South Korea in general then chances are you will read in a traveling brochure or website visit Insadong since it is generally speaking the birthplace of Seoul Most of the traditional items have all been commercialized and overpriced The city does provide some traditional entertainment with music costumes and live shows traveling down the street In short visit it take your pictures purchase an item or two have a coffee and head somewhere else
12609,3,Insadong is too much commercialized these days; there are too many shops foods are expensive and there arent many traditional things to see
12610,4,Special food and the price is fair There is a Han Jeung Mak Korea Sweat steam curtains  in Ikseondong
12611,5,Nice cafes and restaurants littered throughout Found a very quaint rustic authentic teahouse nestled in a corner Reached a little too late in the evening but otherwise great place to chill
12612,5,This place is really nice and entertain you will find a lot of souvenirs with a good price you will find some delicious foods too
12613,3,Looking for souvenirs  go to namdemun for cosmetics  go to myeongdong for clothes go to dongdemun Insadong is just a good walk best combined with a trip to gyeongbokgung palace
12614,5,Went on a Saturday afternoon for a leisurely walk for a couple of hrs and found three sets of ceramic coffee mugs that were half off and great for gift giving
12615,4,Of all Seoul neighborhoods this is a top 3 Many shops and easy to walk around Food is not expensive Others areas like Myeongdong Hongdae are as fun and enjoyable Close to many attractions
12616,3,Its a pedestrian street with small shops on the sides selling similar things A few small restaurants looked nice but we did not try them We had very good shaved ice at a nice desert shop there Overall its nice to walk around there if you have time but not a mustgo place
12617,4,Walked from insadong to myeongdong after dinner Its one looooong straight street down  Preferred the quaint vibes of insadong how the architecture is unique and how its is less crowded compared to myeong dong Worth to visit
12618,4,Great place to see old architecture and check out some quaint local stores Can get a bit crowded towards the top of the hill be prepared to walk
12619,3,Very touristic lots of souvenirs shops but also lots of place for eating Ssamsilgil is a mustgo if you are in Insadong OSulloc is also a good place for a break
12620,3,It was nice one of my favourite restaurants is located here But its not really the ultimate place to go shopping Youll find a lot of tourism stuff and souvenirs here and there exists one bigger alleyish place where the stuff are handmade but way overpriced
12621,2,When any place is marketed as a street for tourists everything you see is guaranteed to be overpriced Do not buy souvenirs here or haggle haggle haggle as they will cost you double of what you could pay at other markets like Namdaemun Its an interesting street for a stroll and close to other attractions such as Bukchon and the palaces but not a critical place to visit
12622,5,The street has a lot of beautiful traditional shops and items We just walk around and picked a restaurant for lunch It turned out to be the best meal with affordable price for my whole trip at Seoul We also went to tried Hanbok at culture centre with a small fee sufficient for us to fool around with Hanbok 
12623,5,Insadong is mainly a shopping spot for various souvenirs Theres so many different types of gifts its fantastic definitely go at least twice
12624,4,In a city filled with artificially designed tourist traps this area is among the few places that are actually worth visiting as a tourist It is very easy to forget that Seoul and for that matter Korea is more than about twenty years old Insadong is one of those few reminders That being said it is a sight and the shops are all designed to cater to tourists so there isnt much to DO there As a walking destination though it is most certainly worth a visit
12625,4,This is another of the many bustling shopping and restaurant areas of Seoul There is always a lot going on here street food shops restaurants The peoplewatching is great You can easily access this area by subway
12626,4,Souvenir shops and restaurants alley ways all seem to contain more restaurantsone wonders how they all survive typical souvenir shops worth visiting but certainly not a priority
12627,5,Went to the Tourist information centre and then the shopping area Lots of quaint shops with handicrafts around Insadong Bought some lovely tea cups Found this more interesting than the other shopping areas
12628,5,Lots of little restaurants tucked away in the alleyways and some stalls selling local knickknacks good for souvenir shopping
12629,4,Lots of souvenir shops Tours often include this as a stop Our favorite was the Cat Cafe where you can have tea or coffee and pet the cats
12630,5,Too many tourists and everything is overpriced but this is one of my favorite places in Seoul You can spend hours wandering around the narrow streets and find yourself drunk and eating pigs feet
12631,4,Take your time and do not buy immediately since prices are dropping further down the latest line Worth at leadt an hour of strolling around
12632,5,this is the place where you go to buy souvenirs its good to try bargain with them especially if youre buying more than one thing
12633,4,I love Insadong and its environment Not as crowded as Myeondong market and easily to navigate around Theres even nice cafe and ALIVE museum
12634,4,Go to Insadong to enjoy the traditional Korea Nice place to shop for souvenir with good price Street art performance in the evening
12635,4,There are a lot of different shops for all tastes Walking along the small pedestrian streets bordered with small boutiques is a pleasant way to shop and stop for a coffee in kawai coffee shops Charming area on Sundays where locals go for a walk too with romantic couples buying bouquet of flowers
12636,5,Insadong is a quaint and charming neighbourhood of stalls selling traditional crafts Good for getting unique souvenirs for your friends and family back home I got a paper fan from a traditional paper shop for a good price and pouches from another shop Check out Ssamziegil as well a shopping complex that spirals all the way to the top without the need for stairs Lots of fascinating shops around including a poop cafe Jogyesa and Tapgol Park are nearby as well
12637,5,When we stayed here for 10 days we had a great time walking around in the evenings after dinner catching various local artists perform from music to magic shows etc
12638,5,Insadong area has many tourist shops along the main thoroughfare but by the cheap stands where you almost feel like the shop owners are begging you for your money Nice area clean and safe
12639,4,If you visit Insadong try to find the multifloor art and craft centre which is packed with interesting and unusual tiny shops Also good shops and restaurants all over the place
12640,3,We found there was a much of a muchness at this market affording some variety and choice but more expensive than other markets we had been to You have to admire how quickly they translate their Won price into the currency you are carrying and we found them a little pushy The street traders were better and more fun to deal with in the short time we were there
12641,3,It was interesting to walk down the street but compared with other areas especially if you have access to shop outside of Osan Air Base the stores seemed really overpriced We ate at a restaurant on a side street that had a totally different price on the menu than what we ended up paying Look around in other areas before buying stuff here
12642,4,Come here for a nice walk and some hotteok I first got some hotteok at Myeongdong but that was pretty bad But the one from Insadong amazing Even my sad whos not fond of sweets loved it You have to try it Other than that if youre interested in art and traditional trinkets Insadong has them Brushes and all that Theres also a bran of sulbing here so you can drop by and rest while having some bingsu Injeolmi is still the best
12643,4,Compared to places like Namdaemun market or Dongdaemun market this place is more artsy and slightly more upmarket You get to buy pretty souvenirs and trinkets Theres a small mall full of handmade crafts that are unique but naturally cost more The small streets have an old feel to it and good for taking pictures You probably need about 115 hours to explore this area Theres a palace within walking distance that you can visit while you are at Insadong
12644,5,You can buy souvenirs at Insadong market with much cheaper price than Myeongdong and Dongdaemun Find magnetic memo holder keychain chopstick spoon fork and many more with discount from seller if you buy many items
12645,4,Lots of different types of restaurants and shops If you come to this area you will find variety There is something for everyone
12646,4,Much like anywhere else in the world souvenir shops are full of the same old made in China cheaply produced good On the opposite side Insadong is a very pleasant place full of restaurants traditional tea cafes interesting art and much more A mustsee if you are in Seoul
12647,4,Insadong is full of unique and interesting shops There is also plenty of restaurants to choose from A great place to visit to shop and to be a tourist Use the metro as we made a mistake trying to get there by taxi Taxi driver got lost serious and we lost our patience so just got off the taxi and walk using iPhone google map 
12648,4,I went twice and both times had fun First time was on Saturday before noon and freely look around and appreciated the shops and all the amazing things you can find there I didnt manage to finish so I decided to come back on Sunday afternoon  It was packed and the atmosphere changed completely I took a lot of pics of what looks to me like a variety of humanants and had fun too But if you dont like crowds but sure you avoid Sundays ;
12649,4,Insadong has good restaurants and some shopping if you want to buy souvenirs Since it is a very touristic area prices are some what high compared to other areas in Seoul If you feel you want to cuddle with cats you can try thr cat Caffe
12650,4,This is a nice area to shop at smaller boutique shops It is not as crowded as other areas and there are small alleys where good restaurants reside Worth a visit You can also rent costumes here to walk around the palaces and take pictures
12651,4,Not as big as Myeongdong yet more artistic and historic  equally as commercialized though Invading used to be the place where artists and officials hanged out due to its proximity to the Palace It is a very nice walk throughout the area with great Tourist Info and free wifi If you want some good art pieces then you can get it here but know that it will be pricey Nice souvenir stores local restaurants and shops this area  south of Anguk Metro Station and walkable to Myeondong is my favorite
12652,5,The market lanes are interesting with a good range of goods as well as cafes Some stalls have more unique items The poo cafe was quite an experience Also suggest the nearby music mall if youre at all musical  you will see millions of instruments and a huge range of musical equipment at this multilevel mall
12653,5,This is the place to visit if youre looking for handmade paper or beautiful lamps If you visit this place on Sunday the street will have no traffic and is open to pedestrians
12654,5,Street full of arts n handcrafted stuffs If u wish to be different I encourage u to get your souvenirs from here rather than the typical keychains n what not the mainstream tourists always buy  Def very different shoppin atmosphere frm Myeongdong or Dongdaemun I prefer this  And u can walk down all the way to the famous stream  
12655,5,Get lost in the side streets or walk the main road either way you will enjoy your time in Insadong I went there the first time with a walking tour for dinner and we had some great authentic food then I found myself going back on my own when I had some free time to walk around and by gifts for my family at home Very close to the subway which makes it very easy to visit
12656,4,It is a very nice touristic  in a positive way placeStroll along  on the way form the Palaceforgot which one the main one look at the small shops tea souvenirs it is all hereWORTH A VISIT 
12657,4,We went on a Sunday afternoon and the whole area was packed Lots of stores selling exactly the same things But a couple of gems if you look hard You will never confuse this with high end shopping but it was fun for awhile
12658,4,Insadong is an area in Seoul and the main street is Insadonggil which is connected to a multitude of alleys that lead deeper into the district1 with modern galleries and tea shops It is very interesting to browse the stores and to try the street food from local vendors
12659,5,Insadong gas a special place in my heart Love it Some of like old city feeling Hand made stuff good cafes and food and close to really good shopping
12660,4,A pocket of cool in Seoul Lots of streets to wander and shops to keep you busy You can pick up handmade goods and also souvenirs here
12661,4,The long street has several types of shops and local memoirs and souvenir are very popular You need to do a lot of bargain at many places Some good restaurants around I went to Little India and found it to be average
12662,4,Plenty of shops cafe and restaurant Pedestrian walk offers a good experience as you pleasantly stroll through the streets Many tea houses and art pieces Retail shops selling cosmetic soveiniers and crafts
12663,5,Of so many unique souvenirs sold here I just love the range of handmade soaps they can offerBought a few home and noticed not all are of worldclass qualityScents just disappear after a few usage and do not moisturize that well as advertisedOthers are definitely worth a penny One can find many other souvenirs here eg watchesjewellerieshome decorsgiftsinteresting clothesetc Semi open air concept the entire shopping area so do avoid on rainy days
12664,5,Insadong is a pretty road with souvenirs shops on left and right it was nice to have an afternoon walk here I saw many girls using hanbok but i didnt know where to rent  There are a lot of cosmetic shops too like Etude Innisfree Nature Republic Aritaum Street food snacks sell cheap food like toppokki egg bread etc Here you can buy a pair of socks for only 1000won very cheap and cute 
12665,4,You can find anything you want to buy as a souvenir here but without the merchants hassling you There are also many great restaurants Try one of the small ones on a side street
12666,3,It is what it is You can buy high priced tourist stuff here eg boxes inlaid with mother of pearl We drank tea at the OSulloc store and bought some packs of green tea to take back as presents But really youll be better off buying your presents for folks at home from a museum gift shop or a folk village or even from the duty free stores at Incheon airport
12667,4,Been here several times and its a place which you dont get bored Go there early and you can easily spend a few hours there There are plenty of shops to buy local souvenirs from cheap to expensive lots of variety Highly recommeded
12668,4,This is by far the best part of the city It has many small shops and you can have great meals here
12669,5,A place where you can find souvenir items from Seoul Option to have your dinner or lunch here  food is Bit cheaper compared to Myeongdong District
12670,4,Visited Ssamzegil and the nearby restaurants Place exumes a different feel and very traditional Particularly interested in this place which u had no clue of the name of the restaurant but it is very near Ssamzegil Insadong 14 gil You should try this dish in the picture
12671,5,Little side alleys off the main street offer a wealth of dining choices We didnt bother with recommendations just found a place that featured a menu that interested us and it was fine Shopping on the main street was fun and in the evening strollers and musicians and theater groups added to the ambiance
12672,4,In the city center a lot of stores with everything you need to buy as gifts Reserve at least 2 hours to have time for more stores
12673,4,Had a lot of fun in the area Nice places to sit outside and enjoy dinner or simple drinks Dont expect a lot of women there since its a gay friendly area We enjoyed it being straight though Everyone was more than welcoming
12674,4,Nice little tourist gifts to bring back to friends or family A few interesting shops to throw into the mix which is nice though Nice to see it if you are close 
12675,4,This is a good spot to shop as a tourist You get a better idea of the unique cultural aspect of Korea instead of the globalized world market industry youd see at other malls and shopping areas
12676,5,As I had a free day I went out city site Recommend from the hotel I went over there I found a very young modern places in a lot of Caffee small bars nice small shops small and very pleasantly streets Real nice to walk around Great atmosphere Good afternoon walking
12677,4,Lovely street with lot of souvenir shops However price usually remains the same throughout I didnt try bargaining as the prices were reasonable
12678,5,I go back here all the time The scale of the place is more suitable for pedestrians and the main pedestrian street is great for walking and seeing There are nice multilevel cafes and stores
12679,4,Vibrant neighborhood with lots of shops and restaurants along the stretch of the main road and the inner alleys The locals are friendly but most can barely speak English The tourist information center by the entrance employs young folks who speak excellent English and can provide maps and other useful resources and information
12680,4,Shopping area with stores that carry many items that the average tourist may be looking for Also many different restaurants to try
12681,5,Beautiful and fascinating shops piled on top of each other Lots of wonderful items to buy and great little restaurants
12682,5,While Myeongdong and other districts  areas in Korea are good places to shop in I absolutely loved Insadong more specifically because of the artsy items you can find Was able to buy decors and other unique items that were different from the usual fanfare of beauty products and touristy items Dedicate 3  5 hours for this
12683,4,Interesting dung theme rooftop cafe in Insadong You need to walk round the building with crafts shop before you reach Can leave dung message on the wall and glass Novelty
12684,3,A busy mostly pedestrian shopping street We were a little disappointed It is mostly a touristy souvenir and local art shopping street There are many restaurants and Im sure some are good We however blindly picked a not so good one for dinner We found some of the historical sites much more interesting but if you like souvenir shopping Insadong is the place to go
12685,4,Full of interesting and moderately price shops courteous vendors that are not shouting andor following you Insadong has a very interesting mix of shops and restaurants bars and many cafes noteworthy Paris Croissant to try You can find really nice folk art specially clothing very elegant pieces for ladies good craftsmanship and creative styles A very nice place to be in Seoul a must lots of variety everybody is friendly
12686,5,We stayed in Insadong so had the pleasure of crossing this street every day during our visit Its got an old charm feel about it which is delightful Some nice little cafes line the street and the shops sell beautiful trinkets including jewelry art work and souvenirs A must for visitors to Seoul
12687,5,Myeongdong is great for regular products especially socks and the lively vibe but to me Insadong is the best shopping street in Seoul Go here for all your touristy souvenirs and visit the old lady with an open shop on the corner selling ceramics at a very good price
12688,5,This is a great shopping area You will find some great little treasures and gifts to take homesome great potterylittle tea sets beautiful fans and ofcourse tshirts It is more antique styles
12689,4,nice area to chill with good restaurant and many street food go and get lost there as u can find hidng gems inside this area
12690,4,I had some time between meetings so my colleague took me here for a couple hours Was really nice to walk around looking in shops and enjoying the old style buildings and lively atmosphere We foudn a great little tea shop and enjoyed some Ginseng tea
12691,4,Insadong is 1 of the famous shopping areas in Seoul full of mouth watering street food and shopping variety  colorful and is full of lights at night
12692,4,The place is very close to Gyong Palace and is worth exploring Lots of shops selling souvenirsDont buy goods at the asked prices as they bargain a lot
12693,4,Traditional dressgifthanbokcosmetics you can find every thing this colorful Street Turkish ice creams boy are very funy and they have good icecream
12694,5,Neat shopping area typical of Seoul Super stores restaurants bars etc Shows the true life of everyday Seoul people Met some interesting persons
12695,4,Located near Gyenonbokchung palace and the US embassy This seems like a central location in Seoul The market has many souvenir stores for tourists and there seemed to be many english friendly restaurants It is 20 minute walk from Seoul Train Station if you want to do that Also from here one can walk to all other major Seoul attractions The market is a stop on the Seoul Tour Bus I was there on a Saturday evening and the place was busy and bustling
12696,5,Insadong is a nice small town full with boutique hotels and food outlet There are many alleys with small family run restaurant People there are nice and friendly Subway station are well connected to other major cities in Seoul Would recommend you to stay here and travel around in Seoul for backpackers or family holiday
12697,3,This semipedestrianized road has all the hallmarks of a typical commercial tourist area tour buses crowded near the entrance massproduced souvenir shops retail handicrafts tea houses and bland commercial art galleries Insadongs saving grace is a charming mix of Joseon period independenceera and modern architecture Some of the nearby restaurants and food stalls are worth recommending like Bukchon Son Mandu
12698,4,If you are looking for souvenir shop Insadong it;s the best place to visit tshirt mask magnet key chain chopstick with good price you can bargain in some shop good place to walk
12699,3,Contrary to the numerous positive reviews here Insadong was not very exciting for me It is merely a couple of streets lined with souvenir stalls and art galleries antique shops Not very unlike the rest of the rest of the markets in Korea except that this place is a lot smaller and less exciting The caricature shops charge exorbitant prices as compared to places like Myeongdong and Hongdae The cafes are also significantly less vibrant and colorful than the abundance of coffee places in Seoul Maybe Im just not an artistic person but I failed to be charmed by this little street A place I think I would skip if I have limited time in Seoul
12700,4,Insadong street nice place for many shop mix between clothesaccessories artists foods and elses  Its very good place to take around in this area
12701,5,Spent a couple of hours wandering up and down the lanes  some shopping lanes some tea houses some food lanes It gave me a real feel for the old part of the city of 24 million people
12702,5,Went for the shopping but learned that this area is known for having a lot of expats We shopped ate and then participated in the pub crawl that night Go afternoon and stay till late
12703,4,Lots of souvenir shops and restaurants in a touristy area of Seoul Antique shops are also around but not too sure how genuine their wares are
12704,4,Close to my Hotel New Kukje  I found this a very easy place to navigate to with my local map and it had a good mixture of shops both cheaper and upmarket and eateries 
12705,3,Colorful crowded lots of street food  souvenir shops and restaurants However streets are littered with trash and cigarette butts people spittings which reduces the quality of a tourist spot I stayed thru a weekend and after a Saturday night the streets are full of trash  leftover food from people eating on the sidewalk they set up little tables and chairs on the sidewalks for eating and drinking at night A single worker trying to sweep the street in the morning I feel so sorry for him with that tough job Food is dumped in storm drain creating a foul smell in some spots
12706,5,The street is filled with many stores having handmade souvenirs These are unique wood crafts and jewelry Its a good shopping street for some of the unique gifts for your friends
12707,4,This is my first visit to Seoul and Im glad to visit Insadong which is full of craft and boutique stores as well as cafes The best part is I came on a Saturday but there werent huge crowds  like some other attractions in the city
12708,4,Insadong has a bunch of restaurants and stores The area was really cool Lots of different stores The area really lit up at night
12709,4,If you dont speak Korea this is good place to do your shopping and eating If you are looking for designer copies you can get them all in one place just ask They are more expensive than in China but if you are in need you are in luck You can also negotiate the price the avarge discount if you pay cash is 10
12710,5,Lots of walking so its good to stop at the Information centre to get a map and ask for recommended routes to use Along the way there are private mesuems art gallery cafes restaurants etc to visit You could spend a day walking around
12711,2,If you in seoul only for a few days or want to get some presents quickly you are right there But if you want to get a glimpse of original seoul atmosphere better go someplace else I felt almost like it was some kind of tourist trap
12712,3,I was not particularly impressed from InsaDong Just nice to walk around as the main road is in the shadow of nice trees
12713,4,This is a good place to buy souvenirs  50 less than the souvenirs would cost inside Incheon Intl Airport Other stuffs are also expensive but must try this one store that sell fluff dessert i forgot what its called its probably how cotton should feel like
12714,5,I had heard a lot about the old teahouses and this is the street to find all of them The street is right off Anguk Station so very easy to reach also
12715,5,The tree lined Main Insadong Street is filled with traditional tea houses yaki mandu dumplings street food a Hanbok cafe photo studio 25 art shops souvenirs cane cone soft serve ice cream a little toy store an ancient pagoda in the tappol park a Fart cafe with poo cakes  my boys thought it was fun behind Insa Art plaza a 3 story craft bazzar and cafe and a trick eye alive museum for the kid in all of us I was able to get my kids to let me shop with the promise of ice cream so everyone was happy Anguk station exit 6 turn left at info center in 200 ft Or Jongno 3ga station exit 1 Walk 23 blocks Turn right then leftaccross from tappol park There alleys with more shops and Chinese antiques off the main road But you can spend as little as 12 hours here and still see a lot My husband hates to shop so I have to be quick
12716,4,Visited as part of tour and learned a lot of history of the area Also bought some really pretty rice paper paintings
12717,4,A really busy popular place for traditional souvenirs Many shops and foods however reality is its more 4 shops copied and pasted 100 times and some interesting craft or independent alternative art shops  You can really just walk into any shop get what you need and the price would be the same or very close in the other 100 down the road  If you have time then browse around and think about things as you pick up almost identical items in each store only to question if its really a good souvenir if its mass produced in such a way  But as far as atmosphere goes its a nice walk around and good place to get those gifts for family members before you leave korea  PS Many people say its overpriced but you will find the same things at the airport duty free shops leaving Korea for double the price
12718,5,This place offer you a lot of thing like food traditional food fast food traditional item painting cloth arts souvenir convenient store cosmetics street food street show and ect Love this place so much You can find weird thing at this place The must visit place when you in seoul korea
12719,4,If you love culture architecture art and history this place is highly recommended Its easy to imagine oneself transported to the past while walking along the streets lined with the well preserved old houses  Drop by Ahns art studio We purchased a cat painting and he made free sketches of our daughters Hes quite a fun and interesting character
12720,5,its a really good place for souvenirs and local stuff I bought good stuff from there you will also find a lot of skin care brands a long the way
12721,5,There are so many cool shops  restaurants in Insadong I went back there like 3 different times I would recommend going there for shopping street food  people watching
12722,5,the place u must gotradition food and so many cute stuff               Osulloc 
12723,4,Its a super artsy place with both traditional and modern arts There are lots of handcrafted item as well thou pricing could be a little pricey Theres lots of small food push carts so you dont have to worry about getting hungry Its near bukchon and Samcheongdong so you could spend 1 whole day walking around experiencing the traditional and modern Korea
12724,4,When you are looking for quality gifts to take home this is a good choice A long street with nice shops including eateries you n ed to go to You surely find some nice presents here
12725,5,At first I thought Insadong will be similar to Myengdong or Hongdae in terms of the store and crowd but boy i was wrong Insadong has its own uniqueness as many local artist showcase their work from fashion to art piece So it blend well between big brand and loval store Was such nice experience coming here I recommend tourist to come here
12726,4,People that have been to London may see the similarity as we did Its a nice area of the city and had a real feeling of being the hip place to be Worth taking a walk through on a sunny afternoon
12727,4,Many fun handmade storessome stores offer handmade experience many good restaurants and traditional tea shops This is a also a good place to get souvenirs
12728,5,Best place to shop for souvenirs  food Easy to walk about without getting lost Make your way to ssamzegil for the open air shopping mall One of my most favourite sites in Seoul
12729,3,When we went to Insadong it was raining heavily and chilly It is a long street with lots of shops  There are a lot of shops selling souvenirs Not much differentiation in offerings though But there is however a building there which houses a lot of shops selling interesting items  There are also a lot of restaurants along the street Guess if had not rained we would have ne enjoyed the visit more
12730,5,I found this street by accident next to my hotel I had already bought souvenirs in the Palace shops and I regretted dearly as things here are much cheaper Also this is one of fev places where you will see other EuropeansAmericans Restaurants are expensive though as every that has English name Close to the Buddhist Temple
12731,4,Insadong is a must go place for any art lovers The buildings there are really beautiful and there are buskers along the the street as you go And many handmade crafts are being sold as well as art galleries for people to view their exhibitions
12732,5,Insadong is a lot of fun is less intimidating then Dongdaemun or Namdaemun but still a lot to do and see
12733,4,Pleasant section of Seoul with old buildings kept intact Full of all types of shops and cafes One of the few places where I actually found postcards Also there is a Cat cafe there
12734,4,This area was near our hotel and we enjoyed a couple of hours souvenir shopping here There are stalls in the street in the evenings Everything opens around 1000 am and closes up around 10 pm
12735,5,You can find any souvenirs and any korea l made product and art product too the price here more cheaper than any souvenir shop at myeongdong or dongdaemun
12736,5,I love this place many shop niceto see bit the prize is not to cheap need skill ti analyze the prize here hahaha  for the bag is cheap dont doubt it
12737,3,not particularly attractive nor special merchandise a short visit is enough many shops selling goods for tourists
12738,3,Its a central area with many restaurants and shops selling just about anything Its the perfect place if you have some spare time
12739,3,You can spend half the day walking here There are plenty of eateries and shops selling handicrafts and souvenirs Its a better area to find interesting restaurants tea houses and souvenirs compared to the Myeongdong shopping street Theres a tourist information counter there if you need help Get a map from the nice officer and start exploring
12740,4,Definitely one of the nicest parts of the city The streets are at a more human scale and the small shops appear to be offering more original handcrafted products  Also youll find some pretty good food options in the surrounding area to enjoy
12741,3,This is the best place to get souvenirs plenty of choices available Remember to go into the small alleys for lots of food and drink choices Shop names there like Starbucks and Etude House are all in hangul so keep a lookout Visit the Insadong Tourist Information Center to try on the hanbok for free
12742,3, very good retailers and a few art galleries I am not sure who is buying arts there but maybe it works Its busy and compares with any other high street in a big city but dont see much that differentiates the street or makes it very special
12743,5,This was near our hotel and we went repeatedly Lots of choices reasonable prices Most items were Made in Korea not other places
12744,5,We went to Myeongdung first but I enjoyed the prices and the culture in Insadong much more If you want tourist trinkets to bring home to loved ones this is the area to visit
12745,4,have their street food and shop a little find those red tents and eat at those places we had fried chicken  beer there and chilling with friends
12746,4,with lots of artwork souvenir shops food stalls galleries tea shops Certainly a nice place to shop though not the cheapest and get an idea of what Korea has to offer
12747,4,Insadong is a dong or neighborhood of the Jongnogu district of Seoul The main street is Insadonggil which is connected to a multitude of alleys that lead deeper into the district There are many modern galleries and tea shops Insadonggil is well known as a traditional street that represents the culture of the past and the present There are mixture of historical and modern atmosphere and is a unique area of Seoul that truly represents the cultural history of the nation The area has 40 percent of the nations antique shops and art galleries as well as 90 percent of the traditional stationery shops Make sure you visited Tongmungwan the oldest bookstore in Seoul and Kyungin Art Gallery the oldest tea house
12748,5,Its good to walk and good for sightseeing There are had too many cute things and creative And too many delicious foods on that street
12749,5,This Antique Ally is filled with shops selling all sorts of traditional crafts decorations and souvenirs The side streets also have stores so make sure to go down a few The shop keepers are willing to negotiate if you buy multiple items and youll get a better deal if you pay in cash
12750,5,Another mustgo place for cultures nibbling food and bingsu Take a slow walk along the stretch with your friendsfamily enjoy the people shops which sells interesting things Have an afternoon break with coffee waffles and bingsu 
12751,4,The main street has many lively stores and street food stalls but the side streets have the older buildings and the restaurants where the locals go There is a lovely atmosphere and it is definitely worth going Also a short walk away from Bukchon so both can be done in one go
12752,4,Used to be authentic and nostalgic filled Sadly commercialisation has hit I saying and the cultural aspect has been modernised Good restaurants gone Dont put it at the top of your must visit places Only go if time permits
12753,4,It is an artsy street with many galleries although in my memory there were more when I visited it long ago A place to find old stuff like traditional artefacts and souvenirs There were some old tea houses hidden in the tiny alleys for a break fr the noise of tourists thronging through the place Across the road on the side nearest to Anguk Station you can continue your walk looking at the old buildings with many cafes During the weekends young pple set up their booths to sell their crafts
12754,5,Really wonderful place but really crowded during weekend We can find lot of unique and cute goods in here And also dont forget to take your time to enjoy cup of tea at the traditional tea house
12755,4,its a nice street to stroll on a spring day but its too touristy for me the prices for the souvenirs are a bit expensive The art stuffs are interesting
12756,5,If you visit Seoul without visiting Insadong You are missing out  Highly recommended for those who appreciate foreign cultures I must say after this trip I am actually planning to go visit Seoul again next year and plan to stay at Insadong Souvenir tea house restaurant fashion shopping You name it you have it Walking thru the street in Spring is just  I am speechless No word to describe how happy am I
12757,4,Insadong is a fun street of souvenir shops and galleries with plenty of nice restaurants and lots of great people watching Whether you are in to fine dining or fried chicken and beer you will find it here Get there by 7 because some of the shops close earlier than you might expect The dining goes on even after shops start to close
12758,5,A nice place to visit and do some shopping  you can find lots of things to buy here from souvenirs to food Ssamziegil is spirally laid out building where you can walk all the way to the top on a spiral incline not sure if you get my description haha You get to see a nice view of Insadong from the top
12759,4,Much more traditional than the boutique shops of myeongdong with lots of interesting stalls and shops in every corner It gives you a great feel for how locals live and shop plus you can get some good bargains They dont really do bartering but may give you a small discount if you by more than one thing from a stall Very enjoyable
12760,4,A place where all the artistic people gather and showcase their art pieces or talents If you are an art lover you will definitely love this place as there are many art galleries around
12761,5,If you love walking around have some nice pictures cute little gifts and teatime with close friends then Insang dongs for you
12762,4,If you are looking for something artistic or planning on buying souvenirs this is the place to go There are plenty of galleries tea shops and souvenirs shops You can buy hanbok hanji and many more traditional stuff that you cant get elsewhere A must go place if you love art history culture and to have some time to immense yourself in this beautiful historical alley
12763,5,If you go to Seoul you must go to Insadong Insadong is packed with traditional arts and crafts and handmade goodies for sale It also offers a wide variety of street food and great eateries You can hear and see many traditional forms of emtertainment and also walk into a modern day mall This is all through buzzing streets that have buildings with beautful heritage and architecture Then you look up and the sheer face of the mountains are but streets away Fun delicious and breath taking all at once Of course you can drink with your food too and you are just a strill away from one of the famous palaces and many great museums OUTSTANDING area to visit Get there by subway bus or taxi All cheap
12764,5,A great area for food photos and local handicraft This is a must go if its your first time in Seoul
12765,4,Certainly a nice place to stop shop browse and eat in Seoul Has a great ambience with lots of touristy shops but some interesting boutique offerings as well The lane ways are fascinating The food on offer needs more description than I can give here Worth a visit when in Seoul
12766,5,Try to spend few hours there you will find a lot of traditional and interesting goods This is a place where you can find some gifts for friends and family
12767,3,Insadong got a lot of shop along the road This shopping area is smaller than Myeongdong around 5 times The shop there got a lot of shop sell souvenir which I dont like I only like the small cactus shop inside the mall in my picture and Osulloc Cafe
12768,5,You must visit Insadong It is a great neighborhood full of artist and tourist shops as well as restaurants Dont miss the poop bread located inside Ssamziegil google it Also a great place to find local artist collections
12769,5,This is the neighborhood to visit for classy and artful jewelry pottery clothing art and above average souvenirs Small streets engaging hustle and bustle of tourists
12770,4,also has many souvenir shops should hv bought here price slightly cheaper than Myeongdong probably more competition
12771,4,A street away from our hotel Lots of food Lots of shops Got a dojang Enjoyed a traditional meal at Arirang Restaurant and even a Hoddek from a street vendor
12772,5,I liked this area of Seoul It is more historic and less big city like It is fun to walk around and there are some good restaurants here
12773,5,You can easily spend 12 day here and see what comes your way I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere You can walk in and out of shops without getting hasseled Interesting alleyways to discover  more At least 2 vegetarian restaurants here
12774,4,Interesting place to browse Seems like there is every kind of food or shop you can imagine Just walked through the area but it was fascinating
12775,2,Was here on a Friday night before 9pm but more than half of the shops were closed Couple of shops selling bags and name stamps were affordable  more unusual but the rest were mainly bakeries cafes and beauty products shops
12776,4,After visiting one of the nearby palaces we went to Insadong for lunch and tourist shopping We werent disappointed Had a great local meal bought some nice trinkets shochu pottery set then enjoyed the street food and people watching all the way to the stream
12777,4,We love the walking and shopping street nice set up and easy to grasp local products we need especially handicrafts and traditional arts The ambience after 4pm on weekend was good I love street live performances and how the audiences enjoy and engage with the shows
12778,4,Insadong has a main walking street and several side streets Small shops sell interesting art and craft and other items  Of course there are shops selling the massproduction stuff as well but go for the handcrafted items and you can probably find yourself a unique souvenir to remember your trip to Korea Ssamziegil mall is along the main streetwith its spiralling corridor along which you will find many independent small shops If you visit I also strongly recommend getting off the main street to explore some of the very interesting food options along the side streets
12779,4,There are lots of stalls selling souvenirs  keychains shirts ref magnets scarf jewelries foods etc  some stall sell the the same items while others sell more unique stuff  more personalized items like calligraphy shop and stamp shop  Prices are mostly the same the difference are the designs
12780,3,Only if u have time to spare or craft intrested Nothing much to see or do better make use of your time
12781,5,A lovely area to shop and find a traditional souvenir or the typical trinket type but all in a pleasant setting amidst many side alleys offering numerous traditional tea houses and restaurants This was a real highlight of my visit
12782,5,We went on a Saturday afternoon and it had a carnival like atmosphere There were people dressed up in traditional hanbok and made it even more special  There were groups singing folk songs playing musical instruments and dancing traditional dances  All in all we had a lovely Saturday afternoon in Insadong
12783,3,You can find your souvenirs here; tea cups wind chimes name stamp etc Many restaurants and tea houses along the street Do drop by after visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace and its close to the Cheonggyecheon Stream
12784,5,Actually my favorite area in Seoul from our visit Not as many people as Myeungdong nor as big but just as interesting There are lots of touristy commercial shops but it also includes a big number of art galleries and unique pop up type shops you will only find here There are not as many of the ubiquitous face mask makeup shops you see in many other areas Here you find a lot of antique shops curios street artists and one off concept stores which probably wont be around the next time you visit Also has a pretty fair number of decent restaurants and tons of cafes And its only 15 minutes walking distance from Myeungdong Beware this place close much earlier as its not a night time party place Many places close at 8pm The coffee shops close later though Definitely one of the must places to go visit in Seoul
12785,5,It is easy to reach by metro line exit at Anguk Station and walk about 5 minutes et voila you have an alley full of unique stalls There are bag shops with really cheap price clothes handmade souvenirs antiques and ancient painting tools as well as ancient caligraphy tools Food stalls are also availbale They are all availbale at bargainable prices There is tourist information at the end of the street that provide map The officer are fluent in english and would happily help us about the tourist information The centre tourist information provides hangbok to be used for 20 kinutes for 3000 won which is too pricey But overall its a must do
12786,5,Great place for walking and eating street foods and buying nic nacs for giveaways  We tried some of the street foods and it was nice  Worth visiting
12787,3,I side with the reviewers that were disappointed with this part of Seoul It gets a lot of hype in the tour guides but I found it touristy with not a lot of tempting shops Ok if you have run out of things to do but not worth putting high on your list
12788,3,A one time favorite Insadong has become too touristy The tea museums and restaurants are wonderful but the shop prices have sky rocketed Still a good place to go but dont expect too much
12789,4,We had a nice leisurely walk down Insadong My teen daughter bought lots of specialty art pens and stuff that she says you were either hard to find or were really expensive back home Cute souvenirs everywhere Try the pancake that they sell on the street A yummy treat on a cold day
12790,4,The tour is reasonable and gives you a sense of prized back alleys lanes named after horse movement popular ole local bars and the constructioncar free jumble which populates this touristy area
12791,5,Insadong is a perfect place for a person who loves shopping A lot of shops offering local fashion brand cosmetics and foods This place also have a lot of street food such as tteobokki hotteok and boonguhpang Must visit place when you go to seoul
12792,5,Insadong is a great place to see It is wonderful for shopping and a lovely walking area Its a must see in Seoul if you are visiting There are a lot of cultural shows here Protests often take place at the park across the street from the main entrance as well I have been here several times and seemed to learn something new about Korea each time
12793,4,This was such a great place to visit There are literally a ton of alleys from the main Insadong road Theres a lot of cute little coffee shops to take a break and just enjoy the scenery We loved going early when the crowds of people were not there yet Makes better for picture opportunities when there arent crowds of people Great place to pick up some pottery 
12794,3,Insadong didnt impress me Too much touristic jumble for sale The Myengdong area had a lot more to offer when it comes to shopping
12795,4,Nothing really special about this area it is a cute place to try local cuisine and do some souveneirshopping Go for the food
12796,5,Each time we are in Seoul we go to Insadong Nice to walk around visit the shops and offcourse have diner There are several small restaurants at the alleys that cater very good food Try mandu chongol at a small restaurant with a big window so you can see the mandu being freshly made
12797,5,This is a terrific street to visit in Seoul Its accessible from several different Metro stations and can be combined with other visits such as to Bukchon Hanok Village We came here twice it was so good And dont forget the little alleyways off the main street pedestrian mall  we found a tiny place with a combination platter of steamed and fried dumplings for only 8000won up one of those alleys Its very popular with locals and tourists alike and gets very busy on weekends There are tourist shops and souvenir shops art pottery and photo galleries coffee shops and eateries  so much to see There are some street food vendors too  try the chicken and spring onion barbeque skewers I liked the octopus cooked on hot coals too And my wife loved the Turkish ice cream Just go there
12798,5,If you are looking for a gift to take home or looking for your friends and family gifts this is the place great reasonable shops and restaurants youll even find some street performers
12799,4,Insadong can provide the nicest or the most cliche of modern Korea We enjoyed a violinist and guitarist  Two musicians who were among the best ever street musicians of my life
12800,5,This is the area to pick up souvenirs the street is lined with shops There is a small shopping mall here and there is some original poducts We bought a few things from here On the street there is a couple of guys with signs advertising a dumpling shop go try it the food it is really good We ate at a couple of these and the food was always fresh and hot
12801,5,made in korea souvenior selling 1000KRW here the food also selling cheap compare with other areas a nice place to visit
12802,4,There is a very cute shopping mall there that you should see Its easy enough to find so just look for it  otherwise there are tourists shop with lots of interesting wares and the ambiance of the street is also nice I really liked it
12803,5,Cool place for a wander but be warned youll end up spending too much time and money here Nice shops and stalls and good restaurants even for veggies
12804,4,Its pretty near to the Hanok village walk around for cafe hopping and enjoy the scenery Hop around for some shops selling souvenirs as well all the shops should be more or less the same
12805,5,Super cool area wasnt expecting to find so many art galleries everywhere Also many traditional craft stalls  shops
12806,5,Great for shopping and eating out in small authentic local restaurants Great for walking and sightseeing too
12807,5,From the moment I arrived at Anguk stationI was mesmerized by some of artwork I found along the way and easily fall in love with this place
12808,4,Many traditional craft stalls galleries and tea shops dot the areaVery easy to get to from any part of Seoul via the fabulous subway system A pleasant way to spend a few hours
12809,4,A good place for a Budget Friendly Shopping for Souvenirs  the variety is good with Budget happy goods Only wish more people could speak English
12810,3,I was told by a local that Insadong is a must visit for first timers to Seoul Im not much of a souvenir shopper but I could see the variety of souvenirs were very good from the ubiquitous magnets to hancrafted bags and traditional writing brushes In terms of souvenirs this is better than a market such as Gwangjang so I agree that tourists looking for these things should come here You will not be disappointed This is also near the Bukchon village and the unique Cheonggyecheon stream which should be very easy to find on a tourist map
12811,4,Insadong offers a variety of shopping from clothing to souvenirs We did most of our souvenir shopping here as we were happen to visit the area but i guess its cheaper if you shop in traditional market Worth mentioning that you could find a lot of hanbok shops around the offer traditional and modern type of hanbok but in general hanbok prices are expensive but surely can find a lot of options here If youre visiting bukchon village drop down here to have a look its walking distance from there Lots of street food around as well
12812,4,The food there is great Ssamgil Alive Museum and some other fun activities are in Insadong This place is suitable for the young and hang out with friends
12813,5,I like the street and its fun to walk around there A new trend has started with students wearing hanbok and the get a free ticket to Gyongbuk palace Lots of museums with art for all people The restaurants there are nice and you need to walk around before you choose A great place to visit in Seoul 
12814,5,This was the place to go for getting gifts for friends that is for sure There was lots to see  do as well I got my Han Bok pictures made in this area as well
12815,5,Our last stop to pick up souvenirs and try some street food The Sunday afternoon atmosphere was pleasant and did not feel over crowded It is very close to the Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces and the Bukchon area We also spotted Hollywood celebrity Chloe Moretz being serenaded and interviewed in the streets I cant comment on price comparisons but I picked up a few small things and the street food was inexpensive I especially liked the pancake type stall that filled the pancake with sugar honey and peanuts
12816,3,Walking distance from Changdeokgung Palace so easy to see on the same day Walked around had a coffee and did not find anything to buy There were cruise tour groups dropped off in bunches and it seemed touristy to me but still worth it because I got a good feel for local crafts and souvenirs Allow an hour at most and youll see plenty
12817,5,Lots of fun Definitely made for tourists Lots of gift shops art shops restaurants street eats and tourists
12818,4,Youll see the authentic Seoul in this area Its nice to walk around with some old restos and small stores I liked the shoes I bought from a small almost sidewalk vendor shop for only 10k Won
12819,4,Its my goto place for a new visitor to the city Even with the commercialization done to it Insadong is still the place for newcomers to buy souvenirs and see traditional aspects to Seoul I recommend the Gyesong mandu place for a more traditional and delicious meal than the tourist traps
12820,5,This place has many wonderful places to shop and eat You can pick up souvenirs unique art and street food My partner took me here and surprised me with couple rings The atmosphere was very interesting as you try to look at everything I enjoyed here more compared to myeongdong
12821,4,A recommended place to visit for arts lovers Its a traditional street where you can find lots of cultural related stuff including tea houses and museums This place is very popular among the tourists too  For those interested to visit stop at Anguk station and from Exit 6 go straight for 100m before turning left into Insadong Ssamzigil shopping mall is also located here
12822,5,Even in cold weather the walk in Insadong is worth it Dont miss the shops with pottery modern design pieces handcrafted items and especially Buddhistrelated artifacts The design museum located in Insadong is worth the trip as is the gift shop Also on your walk visit the huge Buddhist temple
12823,4,A chance to see Seoul in the flesh stalls market and plenty of life to see Shopping inexpensive  worth a visit
12824,5,High end places yet a bit expensive Lots of trendy people lives here Should check out so many brand flagship stores here Lots of good cafe inside the store like cafe Dior and cafe Hermes very interesting And when night comes theres the most popular clubbing place young people gather and party till very late like around 6 Should check out this most popular places now in Seoul   
12825,4,There are so many restaurants in Insadong we had a hard time deciding what we should eat And if you are looking for souvenirs this is the place to shop in
12826,5,Loved the shopping area in this district  very quaint and original with a great selection of shops and street food
12827,5,This is another shopping area if you are looking for some costume jewelry scarfs and lots of restaurants nearby to this place
12828,5,Everything I love is here Art craft nice people good food beautiful weather in August  I could spend hours walking around looking at many artistic shops with lovely flowers small plans andtaking picture  If you are similar to me you will love Insadong Seoul
12829,2,Way too touristy to me It was extremely crowded and didnt offer anything I could find that I wouldnt find elsewhere I guess shopaholics might like it but I felt the same things could be found elsewhere
12830,3,An interesting area as cooking displays and traditional papers and clothes for purchase but it was too cold to walk around that day
12831,5,A nice half day stroll ; get to see shops  take your time browse get a latte ; Suitable for everyone; wheel chair accessible
12832,5,Very beautiful area with many tourist attractions the street food is excellent as well as some of the hidden coffee shops good place to purchase souvenirs
12833,4,Best tasting street foods Ive tasted so far There are plenty of things to do and eat in Insadong Though it could be crowded sometimes
12834,4,Go to this area if youre looking for souveniers to bring back home Although the prices of the souveniers are not as cheap as the ones from Singapore  The keychains and fridge magnets range from 20007000 won You can mostly find artworks coin purses chopsticks cellphone cases scarves hand gloves and traditional bags here in the area This is also walking distance from the Bukchon hanok village This is like 15 minutes walk away from here I did not see much of the street food vendors like those in Myeongdong
12835,5,This is a must to see and buy a range of traditional and modern arts and crafts in Seoul  Wear comfortable shoes and clothing and allow a few hours  We went there using the hop on hopoff bus
12836,4,Fun shopping area with traditional souvenir shops as well as unique handmade items Check out the poohthemed coffee shop on the top level of the mall Some shops prices are reasonable while others are quite high
12837,4,Unlike the chain retailers and beauty shops in Myeongdong Insadong has stores selling art traditional handicraft and local souvenirs There are also some modern specialty shops selling unique creations by local designers  Its great place to wander around and dont forget to explore the side alleys too there are some gems to be unearthed there
12838,5,I go there for the art shops people watching and food Make sure you explore the different alleys Vendors are very foreigner friendly Great place to pick up decent souvenirs that arent found in Itaewon
12839,5,Everytime i go to Seoul i never failed to go to Insadong for some souvenir shopping This is your place if you want to buy some shirts fans clothes and eat street foods while watching some cultural dances
12840,5,We love visiting Insadong and its unique shops and restaurants We always find something new and different whenever we go Although there are many shops with mass made touristy items there are also lots of shops with handmade unique items and family owned shops There are also lots of restaurants with amazing foods Our favorite is in an alley beside the 5 story open air mall; they have a great plum tea We could spend a full day in Insadong just walking through the mail thoroughfare and down the alleys and still have things we missed
12841,4,Amongst the standard tourist souvenir shops are artesian art craft tea ceramics and house decore shops Dont limit yourself to the main pedestrian street Criss cross the narrow alleys and font fear getting lost as you can always link back to the central thorough fare Prices are overall fair so dont go expecting to bargin hard
12842,3,One street filled with handicraft item Visit when u have time Theres is osulloc there and one shopping mall
12843,5,Another awesome stop on our free Incheon airport transit tour We had lunch here in a small alley in an even smaller dive restaurant we would never have found or dared enter for lunch ourselves Traditional food was awesome Super friendly people The local area has lots of tourist stores but there are also genuine local stores and many street vendors Great experience walking around here in this busy real shopping area not unlike walking around in a China town somewhere  maybe only slightly more touristy
12844,5,Insadong also a perfect place to buy sovenir Also theres one store that sell cream cheese red bean croquette Its so delicious and popular you have to queue to get that croquette 
12845,4,Interesting area away from main shopping areas and big brands Quaint shops selling all kinds of things definitely a place to check out
12846,4,Insadong with the nice surrounding the combination between art shopping mall traditional place and teh important things is Foods
12847,3,The quarter is beautiful really typical Sadly it became a tourist trap There are thousands of dulls shops and restaurants

12852,5,If you like cute stuff youll enjoy a wander in Insadong neighborhood A lot of the shops are unique one of a kind From clothes to houseware to souvenirs all super cute
12853,4,There was a wide range of souvenir shops available in the area though you might be able to find some of the same stuff for much cheaper on the 5th floor in Migliore dongdaemun Galleries and craft stores were interesting to browse about for cute handmade goods
12854,4,The place for visitors who are fancy arts as well as the traditional side of Korea An array of shops selling traditional clothes accessories and souvenirs Traditional restaurants and kiosks of street foods are in the vicinity as well For a unique shopping experience head to Ssamziegil  There are a lot of novelty shops as well as caricature artists
12855,4,Went there each time I visited Seoul Its a great place to walk around Mainly its a walking street with tons of shops both side and all are very cheap This street is a main focus for the tourists Most of the shops sells souvenir of varieties You will find lots of street shops for caps shoes Tshirts  Local Foods
12856,4,Most tourists love Insadong As soon as anyone I knew visited wed take them there and they usually loved it It is close to other tourist area such as the palaces hanok village Bukhansan the 4 peak hike etc  Insadong is filled with little artist shops and musician stores There are lots of little cafes and restaurants It is also very close tools downtown and cheongae cheon if you want to stroll down a man made river
12857,3,Insadong is good for shopping for antiques and knick knacks Also is home to Jogyesa Temple which is a short walk from the shopping street Lots of small tea houses and restaurants as well
12858,5,what ever your budget to eat or shop this area has many things to make you come back a few times many good deals for souvenir shopping and a wide variety of food to tempt your tastebuds
12859,3,Was expecting a little more and perhaps we should have explored the streets a little more but basically a tourist street selling a little more cultural middle class gifts
12860,5,Visitors should go here Got a lot of nice thingsEasy to move around by subway Some its are cheap
12861,4,I think that you will have a better shopping experience here than in Myeongdong There are a lot of restaurantsfood stalls and gift shops however it is not very crowded as compared to Myeongdong
12862,5,We decided to go to Insadong and walk around leisurely There are a lot of small shops and food stops to try out as well Try to visit this neighborhood if you got time to spare
12863,3,This area used to be two villages In and Sa Later they combined and formed the current area An old gathering spot for artists this area is a good spot to shop for scrolls or pottery to decorate the interior of your home There are some teatasting establishments here Traffic is blocked off but that doesnt stop delivery motorbikes from making their runs through the area
12864,4,Many shops offering various merchandise especially art The main road is closed to vehicles Similar to Myeongdong shopping area but smaller and offer different items There is a cat cafe near the southern end
12865,5,Shopping and more shopping; Insadong is a combination of new and old products retailers area Bought a Copper Cup and Saucer here
12866,5,Many art shops along the endless road with food along the way we get our souvenir for our friends and relative there We spent almost half a day there We also managed to bought the Jeju green tea from there
12867,5,There are a lot of small galleries with restaurants and tea houses in between It is fun but also can be relaxing which for Korea it is seldom unless you go out of the city
12868,4,Even if you are not going to buy anything simply take a walk to this street and dont miss the Ssamjigil mall Here you will find some very good restaurants and free wifi on the street

12871,5,This place is good to feel the old style of Korea and can buy many traditional items There are many street foods too
12872,4,We came here twice Once to wonder around the small lanes to the gift shops of traditional gifts of handmade paper weaved bags paint brushes and traditional tea houses The jujube was very rich and delicious that we came back a second time to buy the jujube sauce back home
12873,4,Similar to a lot of streets like this there was a huge assortment of shops What made this interesting were the side streets with many small restaurants and shops I found a number of fun places to snack on the arterial roads and a nice place to have a set menu lunch The location is very tourist friendly Also a great place for souvenirs
12874,2,If you have not time you will not miss much  Touristic shops with a lot of nonlocal items Didnt bought anything
12875,4,Tourist area with many art handicraft n local stuff Reasonable crowded even though it was a weekday Nice walk to Savour local delights n feel of an old town Cafes n eateries for those who needed a rest
12876,4,The street is filled with shops restaurants and street foods The shops sell souvenirs and traditional items Recommended for tourist
12877,5,Love Insadong will always go for a stroll here if I have a chance Dont bother to go to a proper restaurant  just have a chicken skewer from a cart at the end of the street Close to a lot of other attractions 2 palaces and a temple great shopping and many places to duck into Several metro stations nearby also
12878,5,Great for wandering and souvenirs Also little authentic places to duck in for food Worth a trip You can do this and Gyeongbokgung Palace together easily
12879,4,Lots of awesome hidden restaurants and drinking places Great for artsy people too I was there for 4 nights in total of my 9 day trip
12880,5,Insadong is a heaven for those who love arts  craft All the shops and cafes here are housed in a small shops along the alley it looks like you were taken back in time strolling here most of the shops here sells souvenirs and crafty stuffs
12881,4,This is a street which I like to walk along leisurely just to look at the arts and craft or stop to get some food and snack  Even during Autumn the atmosphere is great We have some shopping  tea and lunch Look at the lccal handicraft the specialty store Many tourist come around this street
12882,5,so many restaurants so many coffee shops you need not to eat for a week before coming here if you are the type that wants to try it all 
12883,4,Our Hotel Receptionist asked us to walk down this street Its full of traditional and modern shopping and many restaurants and street side food including Indian Cuisine Recommended for all tourists
12884,4,Insadong was easily accessible by Seoul Metro And the area gets so busy during weekends with both locals and many tourists So interesting moving along old residential area with new modern buildings andjust look up youll find lots of interesting cafes and restaurants around
12885,4,Worth going if youre a tourist in Seoul Good eats and tea houses Definitely a tourist trap so dont buy a ton of stuff here There are better deals to be found across Seoul
12886,5,We spent a week staying here Cant go wrong Great food Close to many attractions and easy to get around Just pick a restaurant that looks intriguing and the good is bound to be amazing
12887,5,If you wanna experience Korea you should visit this place Located in the middle of old town Many things to see and enjoy Souveniors can be purchased
12888,4,I guess for souvenirs and exploring local street foodcrafts Insadong is a great place to go especially if youre staying central We stayed around Hongdae so we felt like most of the stuff Insadong had to offer was available in a more cheap and authentic way over there
12889,5,Insadong is really nice place to hangout There are alot of cafes here Its not crowded like Myeongdong if you want to shop
12890,2,I presume that this used to be a cultural and artistic area but sadly its now been overrun with junky tourist shops selling plasticwrapped trinkets and endless souvenirs To be fair there are still gems amongst the tat  a few shops selling handmade paper a couple of independent stationery stores And the art available there is attractive but you dont need to look too closely to see that its massproduced  I found Bukchon Village a little further north to be far more atmospheric and charming And if you can get there the Art Street in Gwangju a city a few hours south of Seoul is delightful and presumably what Insadong used to look like and wishes it still did  I walked up and down Insadonggil a couple of times during my stay under the assumption that Id missed the good bits but I never found them
12891,4,This place has a lot of small shops and restaurants If you are looking for souvenirs you will find something for everyone I recommend personalized stamps as souvenirs which they will make for you in less than 30 min Stamps cost around 35 to 100 which is very reasonable for one of a kind stamps
12892,5,A nice place to walk around Lots of shops from souvenir clothes home decors and accessories to beauty care Restaurants of all kinds are aplenty too Museums are likewise to found a few buildings Insadong is a great place to admire the architecture both old and new
12893,5,met friends and hung out for the evening had a great time nice places to eata dn lots of places to take pictures
12894,4,we stayed at insadonginsadong crown hotel and felt at ease with the place we arrived quite late at night and was able to have late dinner because of the foodshops around very accessible to the different subway lines passing thru it but most of our stops were at jongno sam 3 or anguk station
12895,4,Not cheap but some very beautiful traditional earthenware cups and other kitchen and house ware Nice relaxed neighborhood
12896,4,i was here with other tour group which i booked online for the tour and cant really observed what is interesting there as we are rushed to get into the bus to another place mostly the store are along the street and mostly are selling souvenir variety kind of thing and i saw quite numerous of people selling street food
12897,5,Lots of traditional crafts to see  shop Lovely items from ceramic bowls to handmade earrings Some great places to eat on the side streets as well
12898,5,I loved the InsadongBukchonSamcheong Dong area Its a more unique shopping experience and far from the manic manic crowds of Myeongdong near the Lotte Department Store where the cacophony of vendors enthusiastically peddling their wares to chinese tourists in mandarin was simply tiring The InsadongBukchonSamcheong Dong area in contrast is lined by trees and the shops maintained the architectural gems of the previous structures that house them Beautiful wooden roofs in that traditional sweeping design prolific to the period of their construction ie 600 years ago There are plenty of cafestrendy independent storeschurros the latest craze i guess to weave in and out of
12899,3,Nice place to hangout with partner or friends More like a Hipster place  Some souvenirs seem over priced but generally a good selection
12900,5,Liked the shopping in this street and many places to eat Particularly enjoyed the pancake that we had fresh and delicious Definitely worth a visit
12901,5,This is the place where Seoul artists display and sell their arts Souvenirs are also quite cheap here
12902,4,Nice place for shoppingeating You can find many stuffs here you can buy a lots sovenioureat local food There is traditional performance during weekend Nah its free
12903,4,went my second time here to go around in the small streets and to look at all people walking around  and of course there is lot of foodplaces where you can eat
12904,5,Here can get those transitional thing like wood mask  jade  food and must try Teh house  Omija teh and red bean jujube teh and transitional Korea snack  But the price is like 18000 per set u get 2 teh n 1 Korea cake 
12905,4,Love visiting Insadong as it is always busy colourful and full of life Never a dull moment as you browse through the small shops selling local art  craft clothings shoes souvenirs Tonnes of cafes restaurants tea houses to choose from Some are not cheap as they can spot a tourist miles away  The area is not too large but one can spend a couple of hours here especially if you like taking photographs
12906,5,Insadong is alive with art scene A few buskers are there to entertain visitors There are many shops selling all kinds of things You can watch the world go by by sipping your favourite coffee at the many cafes here There is also a street where there are many shops selling souvenirs at reasonable prices
12907,4,Souvenir shops are the majority in this street and restaurants preparing local food as well Here you can try local traditional clothes and forms it is interesting to try
12908,5,Nice place to be with a friend and give some time with yourself Lovely place good environmentWhat else
12909,3,I think this place is overrated It is famous for antique pieces but they are quite expensive Food stalls are limited as compared to other markets in Seoul
12910,5,This was a very entertaining place to walk around Many shops of a large variety a good feel of the place younger and older people walking the streets and just a vibrant exciting atmosphere
12911,4,it is such a paradise Walking slowly on the old pebbled street enjoying the quaint shops along the street  art galleries hand made items small restaurant souvenirs shop and cosmetic shopping heaven  cant ask for a better place to go glad that i visited this place
12912,5,I had been to Seoul several times wen one of my local friends took me to Insadong In the heart of this modern city there is a small section that is still what Korea was You can buy foods from street vendors shop in smaller independent shops see tradition and culture while enjoying art coffee tea and soaking in A Seoul from the past I will go back and urge you to take in this amazing street
12913,4,My favorite place in Seoul so far I always fancy going to places like these where streets are lined up with small art galleries souvenir shops cafes street performers etc Insadonggil the main street is a popular destination among tourists with its cobblestone walkways lined with trees wrapped in colorful threads and concrete benches with flowering plants One can easily spend a whole day just exploring the place and trying the various street food displayed along the alleyways Just like any other stuff in Seoul I find it most of the items pricey as compared to other Asian countries But that was expected Most of the items are priced at an average of KRW10000 USD850 street food at about USD450 If you are patient enough you can find stalls that sell small souvenirs at a cheaper price Haggling for some reason is not encouraged This is definitely a mustsee in Seoul Highly recommended
12914,3,Disappointing visit to the Beautiful Tea Museum Very difficult to locate it; very out of the way for tourists The waitresses could hardly speak English n not very friendly Also very expensive Would not recommend to anyone unless u are crazy about exotic tea n willing to pay exorbitant price
12915,5,Go to ssamsagiel and go to this one shop enter this shop the owner will say all bag at 10000won and really shop bags here
12916,4,Compared to Dongdaemun the souvenir prices were a few won cheaper in Insadong However there is very little bargaining here Most wont even consider budging from their set price It is a little difficult to find We found it by accident Their alleys have some great food joints We went around here as part of a food tour
12917,5,Insadong people has been my favorit market in Seoul I love the vibe There are lots of store selling unique stuffs here and of course yummy food I do love this place
12918,3,Insadong district is an arty area of Seoul which you can combine after your visit to Gyengbokgung Palace as its just 5 to10 Mons walk away The have some good shops but Souvenirs are cheaper elsewhere There is one particular shop called Arirang which has good quality souvenirs for a very good less price compared to other shops with good selection of souvenirs
12919,4,Wonderful trinkets and handmade items of all kinds made this a fun experience for us lots of things to choose from for all ages Close to Anguk station
12920,5,there is a free tour so you can go an emblematic and fun places to visiti had to stay in incheon airport for quite some time o booked the tour and we did a culinary feast
12921,5,Thoroughly enjoyed walking through this area particularly the art galleries There were many tea houses which all looked very inviting I didnt try a tea house but did sip some delicious honey  ginger tea from one of the side stalls accompanied with a strawberry filled traditional rice cake  yum There are too many galleries to see in one day Definitely put it on your list if you are artsy  like foodcoffeeteadesserts people watching
12922,4,Interesting arty side of the city Lots of restaurants street stalls art  craft gift shops However beware many are vastly over priced I saw identical items for sale in other parts of town at half the price of the Insadong shops so be ware
12923,5,Rows and rows of little shops selling interesting art and souvenirs Its a great place to spend a few hours just browsing and shopping Near to Samcheongdong which has amazing cafes serving delicious coffee waffles and ice cream I would recommend cafe hopping at Samcheongdong and walking off all those calories at Insadong after
12924,5,Must do in Seoul nice area and many small shops and coffees in the area Local residence are still living there so every building looks different but still very traditional
12925,5,I visited Insadong twice on my stay in Seoul Once by accident when I was aimlessly wondering the streets of Seoul and i slowly gravitated towards Insadong as it is an attractive place the other because I was recommended it I was amused to find that the place I went to and had such a nice time and regrettably didnt know where it was was actually Insadong  The Main Street holds the majority of the rabble and there are a bunch of little side streets with interesting hints hiding down them  Whilst a lot of the shops sell the same thing there are some wonderful artisanal shops and galleries where the artist is busy working away in their latest piece  There are plenty of restaurants and bars just head down any side street  At the higher end of Insadong street on the right there will be a courtyard looking thing open up This to me was the real treasure Head in and check out this complex Up the stairs on the right as you enter the floors spiral up until you reach the top There are wonderful shops of craft and fashion all the way up and it finishes in what I gather to be called he poop cafe It was nice in spite of the cutely designed poops  Take your time and amble A nice way to spend a good few hours
12926,5,Insa dong is pretty and has masses of shopsSome quaint and interesting buildings to see exactly as it says in anything you read online We just walked around it Theres loads of food and coffee places And it wasnt too busy
12927,4,Its a cute little area with some traditional  arts  crafts shops We walked around the area on a sunday afternoon and it was very interesting to see the street acts The lunch we had in the area was also very good
12928,5,Really recommend for traditional souvenir shopping and art lover person Nice street with unique shop
12929,4,It falls enroute seoul tower and tour bus has a stop here Well connected by metro n bus It is an upmarket township on the tiny mountain and gives the feeling of a hill station A lot of shops food outlets and designer clothes are available A complete different experience
12930,4,This place is like an outdoor swap meet So many places snd shops I brought pretty hanbok postcards here for a reasonable price Again parking is verygard to find Take the subway here
12931,4,Being a recommended place to visit we made our way there on sunday getting there was fairly easy alight at Angguk station and exit at gate 6 Walk up the stairs about 150 metres turn to the left you will find Insidong A number of shops selling souvenirs paintings coffees shops and restaurants Very laid back and less stressful then in Myeongdong old buildings lining the street and alley filled with restaurants At one of the restaurants where we had lunch it was really an old building with its internal wooden structure still in tact we had to sit on the floor where lunch was served on a low table I like Insadong its laid back atmosphere and no pressure from sales girls selling cosmetics as in Myeongdong In fact we went there again the next day
12932,2,Do not buy any souvenir item from Isadong The items are grossly overpriced many times over I bought a nail cutter souvenir at 5000 won USD45 I had later bought another 10 same item at 7000 won from Dongdaemun  Isadong is a tourist trap and a big ripoff It is ok just to walk around
12933,5,Insadong was the first place I saw when i arrived as my first hotel was in this area It was a fun intro to the city  lots of local eateries and tourist shops It always had lots of people both tourists and locals People very friendly and helpful and always felt safe here Great for basic souvenir shopping
12934,3,Nice area a definite have to check it out while here but I personally expected a bit more Small shops and restaurants are good though
12935,3,I walked around here during the day and also in the evening Seems better to go in the evening Its worth a visit as I said but not too exciting
12936,5,Try to bargain this is a place that you can buy a alot souvenirs from Korea Theres a restaurant in alley it has delicious pork belly hahahaha 30000 won for 2 people
12937,5,I walked here from my hotel in Myongdong Stop by the tourist booth at the beginning of the street for a map of the neighborhood One of my favorite places was Ssamziegil with lots of cool and unique stores I liked the one on the ground floor with dog and cat designs on things This is also the place with the bathrooms There are also the ubiquitous food vendors lining the street which I hear is closed to traffic on Sundays On the narrow side streets are some places to have tea
12938,4,I would recommend walking aroud for a few hours Lots of quaint shops and souvenirs Interesting food stalls as well
12939,5,This is a shopping district the street food is amazing We even had Capri Suns for adults cocktails in a ziplock bag with a straw Its very crowded but at the end of the street there is a park you should not miss Cross the street to the left and go in the gates its very old and very cultural
12940,4,Bit touristic but best place to buy souvenirs in Seoul In some shops you can try bargaining to reach a better price Also check on the origin of the goods if you want to buy Made in Korea stuff as many may come from China
12941,4,Wide variety of shops Staff seemed pretty helpful throughout Easy metro access Humming and vibrant
12942,4,Seoul is a capital of S Korea and a very busymodern city But if you want to enjoy some traditional taste in the city you can go to this area This place does not entirely consist of traditional buildings but it has some feel to it Good mix of traditional and modern elements
12943,5,So many many little shops where the owner designed the products sold Clothing bags haberdashery jewellery ornamentsetc Many little art galleries The main street is a walking mall and has a helpful information booth at the north end The hopon bus has a stop there Its amazing how many small streets and lanes are around there So many eateries and cafes
12944,4,We went there by Taxi from Gangnam so many restaurant and shops It is a really nice place to go when you re in Seoul
12945,4,You can find traditional things you never find out anywhere So many souvenir shop clothes bags and vintage and unique things in insadong i like that i was there 
12946,5,Hundreds of little shops carrying all kinds of trinkets and artwork souvenirs and whatnot Left and right into the alleys are all kinds of small restaurants and other fun stuff A lot of tourists of course but a place like this is nothing without them A must visit if in Seoul
12947,4,Interesting pieces of art and crafts We bought some nice paper wrappers fans wood art bookmarks Theyre all beautiful
12948,2,Insadong is just like the pictures I dont mind touristy places and events but I guess I have my limits and this place was one of them There is certain about of charm to some tourist places in the fact that it is a tourist destination but here it was just too commercial and everything was over priced Hoards are unavoidable there I went on a Thursday Drop by if your near but its really nothing special
12949,2,The Main Street of this district is closed for cars so nice to walk This area is interesting for doing small souvenir shopping and walk around Not super
12950,4,This area is great for an afternoon stroll of souvenir shopping and people watching There brick and mortar stores have the antiques but there are lots of stalls selling cheaper trinkets and what you expect to find in an outdoor market If youre hungry head down the alleys and youll find a plethora of dining options
12951,4,opposite Jogesa Temple Nice shopping street full with artisan and handmade goods You can rent Hanbok to dress and shopping around
12952,5,This is an street where you can find very nice and typical craft of Corea and teas Youll not get dissapointed And is a safe place
12953,4,shops with knickknackssouvenirs fast food stall and small restaurants many bakeries and sweets specialty stores  most places close immediately ones tourists leave the temple  about 5 pm
12954,3,The street is quite nice and the small shops and cafes are very inviting Quite nice to have a stroll through the street The only thing we did not get was what is the fuzz about this area
12955,4,There are a lot of restaurants and small shops in Insadong where you can spend a day walking around or making handy crafts at Ssamzigil
12956,4,The location is only 5 minutes walking from Gyeongbokgung Palace Many shops and eateries along the road Can be crowded but still manageable The prices for souvenirs are reasonable
12957,4,A lots vendors Great to browse and learn about Korea Only complaint No electronic Stores any where A lots of the same Coffee shops everywhere
12958,4,If you want to see outdated gallery this is the place for you but if you want a very good food and great atmosphere this is the place for you Try to avoid the stream and let yourself lost in the many allies you will find very unique stuff
12959,4,The insadong area is definetly recommended Espacially the Insadonggil street has a lot of Shops with good art and handcraft It might be a good place to buy a souvenir from Korea And it is a good starting point to continue towards north to Bukchon Hanok Vilaage or the Gyeongbokgung Palace Can be easily done on a day
12960,5,There are rows of shops that sell art and handicraft  Particularly like their lacquer mother of pearl jewelry boxes They do sell fans and other stuff as well  To get there take the metro line to Anguk station
12961,5,Go down the small pedestrian lane that runs diagonal to the bigger streets Lovely souvenir and craft place Make you sure visit the Jogyesa temple 2 mins away
12962,5,A street where you can buy all the skin care that Korea is famous for and with interesting craft and antique shops as well as street snack stalls
12963,5,I really loved Insadong Yes there are lots of tourist shops but it is still beautiful and I loved looking in all the little shops and street stalls
12964,4,Insadong is a mixture of old school plus new school With good metro access access to a number of parks palaces and museums Insadong is a cheap and exciting place to stay in
12965,4,Insadong begins at its Southern end across from Tapgol Park with a nice plaza The lively area of Insadong includes not only the main street but also a network of alleys Surprisingly they all feel safe and offer a bit different atmosphere than the main passage Little alleys are lined with authentic looking restaurants small antique stores craftsmen and artisan workshops At the Northern end of the Inasadong there is tourist information office There was a folkloric show depicting historic events
12966,5,We are staying really close to here and its a lovely area Lots of little restaurants bars and cafes also loads of souvenir shops We love going for a coffee with our dog and watching the world go by
12967,5,Mom my husband  I spent the afternoon here My husband had never been to Korea so this was a great area to see the culture and do a bit of shopping too Getting a taxi to take us to the main entrance was very easy as was getting a taxi to take us back to our hotel We were able to bargain in a few shops but most would not Pricing was still better than Itaewon and I was able to buy several really cute sweaterstops
12968,5,Bypass the actual shopping street and go into every small alley way that you find You will find beautiful old and good restaurants
12969,5,A place where youngsters hangout If you into photography and especially street photography this is the place you have to visit It has so many interesting spray painting to capture We visited this place for a short time during morning hours and were happy we didnt skip our visit here
12970,5,Similar to other neighborhoods lots of shopping and lots of restaurants Be sure to check out the alley shop and restaurants I found way better food at way better prices
12971,4,Try exploring the side streets sometimes you get better value Also almost everything you buy has a negotiable price Star with 40 asking and move up If they are not willing to budge smile and say no thank you and move on There will be another store selling the same thing down the street
12972,5,We booked a hotel here and had no idea of geographical position but were pleasantly surprised by the area and would recommend to all  great for walks and little alley ways and restaurants etc and not far from bukchon old traditional village
12973,3,Dont bother trying to shop for souvenirs anywhere else in Seoul this is the place plenty on offer and for VERY REASONABLE PRICES  I highly recommend a walk down this street plenty of great food options  look out for the street bar with cheap cocktails 
12974,5,Loved this street so muchA lot of people theremostly young girls and guyswho give so nice atmosphere to this place we had nice walk therebought a lot of souvenirs and had a nice dinner in one of the restaurants
12975,4,Located in the Jongno area of Seoul this an interesting shopping area Go here to spend an afternoon or evening browsing through the interesting shops many with beautiful clothing pottery souveneers etc There are also wonderful coffee and tea houses
12976,4,Hundreds of little shops and stalls offering a vast collection of souvenirs and art products If you tastes are musical instruments then there are many shops with a good range of products This area is near the JONGNO 3 Samgu  exit 3 Its worth a visit
12977,5,Only been there for half days but you will not be regret This is a best place which you can slow down your steps and enjoy the art and the culture of Korea If you have time please go to any 2F coffee shops and sit down to relax with a cup of tea or coffee
12978,5,Such a great place to stay You can walk down from your hotel and have shopping and food choices galore
12979,4,Tried some walking stick ice cream in one of the shop bought some handmade candies in white sugar coated thing cant remember the name Went into 1 traditional tea and dessert shop Nice and quiet ambient but a few interesting food on the menu is not available In fact the menu selection is just approx 20 types for drinks and dessert We order 2 types of dessert made out of rice flour and glutinous rice flour and traditional herbs and 1 traditional tea which cost us 35000 won which is quite expensive  All in all is still a great place to go if you have extra time for something other than fashion  cosmetic shopping
12980,4,Great area Narrow streets lots of shops good for peoplewatching and very close to main attractions You can walk to a lot of them 
12981,4,Pretty nice place to walk through If you dont have much time and you want to buy some gifts or to eat local food this is a good place to start from
12982,5,Just get lost here and you will discover the old korea I really love this place but avoid it after 5 pm Its very crowded specially in holidays and weekends
12983,4,Great fun for tourists best buys are the placemats and chopstick sets lots of choices and colours and take the time to have studio photos taken in traditional costume reasonably priced Check out some of the street food watching sweet making by an amazing Kkultarae maker is a must but if you purchase some freshly made eat it quickly as it does go hard so you cant keep it for later Go up the street then up into the levels of small individual shops much better quality some beautiful products such as creating a porcelain music box great gift or keepsake
12984,3,Many places had individual items some hand crafted and alot of unqiue artwork you could purchase or see Definitely a really nice side of korea to see compared to other shopping areas
12985,3,It was crowded so good for people watching Alleys are interesting Handmade paper stuff to different kinds of art including tat I did like the guy at the end who hand paints the fan on paper You can get your name painted and it also includes the artists signature Apart from that I was exhausted braving the crowd
12986,5,This area seems to attract the locals and what better recommendation could you have for food trinkets clothing materials etc
12987,5,This shopping area quite close to the large palace of Gyeongbokgung can get very crowded but theres a real buzz about the place Its where you can see the old Seoul with its alleys craftsmen and workshops Now its full of souvenir shops all selling various items pojagi traditional ducks madetoorder engraved seals pottery at good pricesThere may be a bit of leeway for haggling and bringing the price slightly down if you pay cash but dont expect massive discounts There are also street vendors selling you coins bags or paintings amongst other things
12988,3,There are many shops in Insadong to eat So if you want to go there you should skip your meal and buy there Many events in INSADONG but its very small place
12989,5,We stayed in this area and we found it very close to the 2 main palaces and public transport The main Indasong gil is a small street where you can walk up the middle of the road with only an occasional car There are lots of shops and places to eat It is also worth aking the time to walk down some of the smaller Indasong lanes I found a few shops here to buy clothes very cheaply
12990,4,That region is very nice especially the shopping street Besides the famous shopping malls the shops along the shopping street offer fairly good variety of items
12991,5,Una gran cantidad de productos pero es imprescindible regatear para comprar souvenirs If you dont bargain they will take advantage of your innocence
12992,3,One early Friday afternoon after work my business hosts drove me to this pedestrian shopping area to browse through the shops for trinkets to take back home We strolled casually up the main street and checked out some of the shops and stalls outside I managed to dig deep into my pocket to buy a postcard But somehow I couldnt get inspired and eventually time got the better of us and we had to move on to our theatre engagement at 5 oclock that same afternoon  I guess that if Id had more time and a clear shopping list I could have made more us of this brief visit Dont let my soso review put you off coming here if youre looking for cheap souvenirs for the extended family  friends back home 
12993,5,Great area of Seoul known for its wonderful little shops This is an ideal area to pick up some gifts for friends and family and all of the shop owners we interacted with were genuinely kind and friendly We spent about 20000 won a humble amount at one shop and the shopkeeper ran us down after we left to give us a couple of free gifts to thank us for our business Cool area to pick up souvenirs and gifts
12994,5,I love this neighborhood Full of artifacts souvenirs and street food I definitely recommend a visit if you are planning to buy something authentic
12995,4,This street has lots of traditional restaurants and cafes There are also art galleries souvenir shops and other cool stuffs but usually items sold here are quite pricey
12996,5,Insadong has it all Shopping cozy tea rooms good restaurants and more Great place to spend an afternoon exploring
12997,4,Insadong is a great neighbourhood that need to be explored There is just a lot of things to see here Really fun and interesting Lots of store and eateries Its crowded but still easy too explore Plan to go here along with bukchon hanok villaage and changdeokgung palace as its nearby
12998,5,Of all the places my husband and I visited in Seoul my favorite is Insa dong Theres so many shops to visit and browse lots of reasonable places to buy presents for friends at home and most of all lots of great places to eat We arrived here late afternoon coming from the Gyungbokjung Palace which is a walking distance from here It was so much fun browsing so many stores each specializing in different handicrafts The choice of souvenirs is mind boggling and the price range is from reasonable to very expensive But the best part for me was the restaurants My favorite was one that only served Mandu and Naengmyeon cool noodle soup I had to go back to this small restaurant for both dishes the next day Insadong is close to the metro and is easy to find
12999,5,Very nice area for food and drink and shoppington of nice local places with good food to decent pricesjust an amazing place and a must see and dorecomended
13000,4,Very touristy but definately worth a vist Very crowded at times but brave the crowds and try some traditional tea cafes to enjoy the experience
13001,4,A trip to Insadong was part of our tour a Great place for people who like to browse and shop Since I am not really a shopper it was just a nice place to walk around and look at the different shops and architecture It was very crowded
13002,4,Interesting street with plenty of shops cafe etc Today is little bit crowded  due national holiday a lot of tourist comingbut it is okay for me
13003,5,This is a fun and vibrant street with lots of interesting shops to venture into to I didnt have enough time to see all the things in one afternoon so this place will definitely be in my itinerary again on my next trip to Seoul
13004,4,This is worth visiting as it is right between the main palaces and a short walk away from the Bukchon village It can be rather touristy and shops sell more or less the same things but despite this the whole area still maintains a certain quaintness to it This may be because we visited during the morningearly afternoon so the throngs of tourists had not yet arrived or the fact that the whole area is a charming mismatch of souvenir shops selling ugly socks verdant alleyways and stands that sell outfits for your dogs  Id recommend going down Insadongs various alleys and visiting some of the coffee shops which serve up absolutely and I dont mean this lightly excellent coffee The art galleries along the street are also worth paying a visit  Souvenirs are a little tacky and generic so not quite worth buying but then again we did not visit the fancier tea stores
13005,5,I love this precinct and never tire of wandering up and down and in and out of all its nooks and crannies Some may shame it for being a tourist area but it is also alive with locals and for the most part well priced goods You have plenty of choice so its easy to shop around if the price or quality in one store doesnt suit you The shop keepers are welcoming and happy to assist when looking for something specific As a fairly frequent visitor to Seoul for business and more recently on holiday a visit is never complete without a wander about Insadong
13006,5,Stopped by this place during our city bus tour and was able to buy loads of souvenirs for family and friends back home Dont immediately buy the first few items that you see In my case I found out that the stores farther along the streets of Insadong offered much better deals 
13007,5,This area is full of antique and interesting shops You can send a little bit of money or quite a bit There is something for everyone There are a couple nice tea shops as well Oh and there is a Starbucks as well
13008,5,No wonder this area is one of the most visited attractions of Seoul It is a traditional streets where you can find an eclectic bunch of interesting items shopping sites simple and fancy restaurants hotels walking areas craft clothes and food vendors and whatever you look for
13009,3,Supposed to be the traditional street of Seoul but with Starbucks Come on Its got some interesting stores and traditional restaurants but Id check out Samcheongdong which is near Insadong It has more to offer
13010,2,Waste of time one street with side streets that cater to tourists nothing very authentic about this Very busy with bus loads of tourists feeding into the place This is the kind of place I avoid when I travel
13011,4,This area is really nice for tourists They have a number of information booths with people that can speak English They also have free maps of the area Its usually quite busy Great place for food and shopping
13012,5,Wasnt sure before I went but so glad I stayed here Great area Lots to see and do  close to all the palaces and transport Certainly a good base for trips in Seoul
13013,4,Insadong was very popular with the locals When we first got there about 1PM on a Sunday it wasnt too crowded but when we left about 3PM the place was packed  The women thought it was a good place to shop for some local trinkets but I preferred to take advantage of some of the local street food I bought a hodduk from this one vendor mainly because she had a line of people standing in line to buy them It was delicious Like a doughnut without the hole The filling was brown sugar cinnamon and chopped nuts fried fresh while you wait The served them to you hot so you drooled waiting for them to cool down  Later on I had a shrimp cake on a stick I enjoyed that as well  Apparently they dont mind if you drink on the streets so I picked up a bottle of Cass at a quick shop and walked around enjoying the culture
13014,5,This is a great place to explore day or evening; do both for full experience Range of prices and goods Great place to get street food
13015,3,Tourists shopping street You will find the same things over and over in all the stores A few are different but thats it I think Seoul has way more to offer than that
13016,3,Very popular for tourist and locals Full of souvenir shops at higher prices than regular stores Good place to kill time if you have extra
13017,5,Fun to go for souvenirs Shopping tip prices are cheaper at the stores in the middle for same goods offered at many of the stores
13018,3,A very touristic street the only interest I found was on small side streets where you can find traditional houses tea places and other interesting small shops
13019,5,After visiting the palace  we strolled down the alley at Insadong Tons of local shops and food attack the senses Take advantage of the offerings and shop for some souvenirs Makes for a pleasant afternoon to experience some local fare
13020,3,Insadong is a wonderful area in which spend a night There is many restaurants and shops some traditional and other contemporanean There is little bars in each corner and great venues with delicious food A must when traveling to Seoul
13021,4,We stayed in Insadong Insta Hostel because of easy access to Anguk station and walking distance to almost everywhere we wanted to be
13022,3,Typical Asian street market Lots of souvenir shops Definitely you have to negotiate prices Street food is also available
13023,5,This little street was so great for window shopping and getting some great local snacks on the way
13024,3,Close a bit earlier than I thought as its quite a touristy place Not only shops closed early restaurants too so beware
13025,5,Definitely worth going to for the range of really nice souvenirs available Insadong is accessible on the red hop on hop off bus Also get a rail pass when in Seoul as the subway system is great
13026,4,This is first time to Insadong and at night it is very busy with street stalls selling all types of items and food Also many different coffee houses and restaurants
13027,4,Very fun neighborhood with great location and lots to do The main stretch is very touristy but the side streets give rise to great food stands at night Dont be afraid to stray off the main path We had a late night dinner at the row of seafood food stands and were the only tourists in sight Great neighborhood if youre looking for a blend of tourist attractions and authenticity
13028,4,This is a great place to buy traditional gifts and have some tea Also some great restaurants especially if youre looking for more traditional foods
13029,3,Our overall opinion of this street was that it was simply just too touristy lacking in authentic goods and services If you are in the market for cheap goofy knickknacks then you will enjoy this area On a positive note there are some really good restaurants
13030,5,Weve just gotten home after discovering this wonderland of nighttime market stalls and restaurants What an awesome area theres handicrafts ceramics art shops  antique stalls to name a few It wasnt crowed so we could easily get around Im planning on going back tomorrow night too
13031,3,Its a street that full of traditional shop It has a lot of local souvenir such as keychain mirror etc
13032,3,shopping  touristy knickknacks some restaurants not much else to do same as rest of the Seoul close to Bukchon village
13033,4,Insadong is a cosy area full of small shops and nice restaurants If you just have a couple of hours to walk around Seoul its a good choice
13034,5,This place is a great way to spend the afternoon in Seoul The pedestrian street runs northsouth This means that you wont have to be staring into the sun There are mostly shops but you can find street food yummy and even some street performances A great way to see culture
13035,5,There was a good shopping strip with a large variety of shops including quality ceramics it is claen and safe and appeared to be frequented mainly by the locals There are a lot of local attractions nearby such as the Changdeokgung Palace and Buckchon villiage It is a very good central area to stay
13036,5,a must to visit place in seoul A lot of store providing art and handicraft Foods and souvenirs T shirts are better then in namdaemun market
13037,5,Good local foods and souvenirs Always crowded with heavy tourers Just avoid few local trendy restaurants and look for old and authentic restaurants
13038,4,Lots of restaurants and bars both inddors or out on the street Older area of Seoul that still has little alleyways that you can explore and find restaurants and shops or just check out how small somebodys house can be in the residential area Note that it is generally a very safe area so you can walk late at night without feeling nervous
13039,5,On my trip to Korea we visited Insadong twice There were so many shops with wallets and purses Clothing and cute nick nack stores lined the street out outside the main market area I got some really good sweaters and gifts for people back home from here In the basement of the complex me and my boyfriend made our own rings with one of the craft vendors I recommend it and they turned out very well
13040,4,Great place to wander and get some reasonable souvenirs Also ate there and for 7000 won got a main meal lovely Also we started with pumpkin soup then a vegetable pancake with lots of little dishes of things to add to it all part of the meal My guide did have to explain what was in those dishes
13041,5,There will be no dissapointment when visiting Insadong; for food; safety; quirky and for spending your cash on souverneirs  Head into the narrow laneways and be amazed at the variety of food on offerOutstanding
13042,4,This place might lead you to antiquing There are shops selling vintage items antiques porcelain and bronze statues
13043,4,Gifts and handicrafts artists and tea houses this is what Insadong looks like A bit expensive if you are buying something very unique  like I said there are many artists in there  but a very pleasant place to have a walk and discover more about Korea
13044,5,Was a must to see while in Seoulloudbusycheery folkfantastic icecreamjust the hub of every thing a lot of the same shopswe did not buy too much but being in the middle of all the goings on was good fun
13045,5,This is a great area with art museums shopping and sightseeing Enjoy street food or sit down dining Very fun neighborhood
13046,3,This primarily is designed for tourists both domestic and foreign to buy souvenirs from a variety of stores We found we were approach at the larger stores by sales assistants as soon as we entered the shops The smaller ones or ones run by single operators allowed you to view their goods casually making the experience more relaxing The prices are similar to what you will pay elsewhere in Seoul the benefit is they are all here together and with plenty of eating places to boot
13047,5,Slightly touristy but charming and interesting nonetheless We went a few times and I still didnt feel like I had enough time to explore Great for just wondering shopping and definitely eating
13048,5,A great place for exploring small quirky and tourist friendly shops Lots of typical potteryfanspaint brushestraditional paper etc A great spot for buying gifts to take home An even better spot for street food and street cocktails The centermark hotel in this area is very well positioned
13049,5,Fun closed to Palace temple food and square shopping mall where it sell all handmade artist creation
13050,3,If you like to do all your shopping and people watching in an afternoon then Insadong is the place for you Located near the subway and with plenty of places to eat They have stores for all tastes You can find cheap gifts and unique handcrafted items too Most stores understand some English and the shops that sell beauty products were more friendly than in Hongdae Grab some takeout and walk down to the river for some peace and quiet
13051,3,This place is more of a party scene Im not really into the party scene Im sure most people will find this area entertaining
13052,5,Traditional Street shopping on SundayMade a trip facinated with Hanbok traditional dressMaking of sweets n painting on t shirtAlso very well placed artistic design of craftsA must place to go esp Sunday
13053,5,This is my second visit to Insadong in 8 months The street has many shops dealing with varied items Cafes souvenir stores food stalls tea houses fashion goods and others line the street An interesting building is the shopping block that you can walk up by a sloping passage instead of stairs We bought various items had shaved ice mango and savored Jeju tea When I first visited on a weekend I remembered that there were steet performers too Mix with the local crowd by your being there
13054,4,A lovely place to sightsee and shop in Seoul I bought many gifts for my family and at a reasonable price Dont leave Seoul without visiting Insadong
13055,4,We wondered along this street for a couple of hours and I was really impressed with the variety of interesting shops to visit Something for everyone in the family rather than just cosmetic shops Clothing trinkets sun glasses shoes for both men and women and great food stalls even brilliant ice creams in crazy twisted corn cones
13056,3,I find Insadong is quite nice and several small souvenir shops but it is not as huge as Myeongdong the good thing is  Insadong is only walking distance away from Gwanghamun and Jogyesa temple so you get 3 places in 1 go
13057,4,Nice but couldn t help feeling a tiny bit of being a tourist in a tourism zone But i might be wrong
13058,4,I love this street lots of vintage cute souvenirs and many other things along the street make sure to visit ssamziegil when you go to insadong
13059,5,Dont just walk in the central street turn to the left  right to find some hidden gems Great coffee shops upstairs as well
13060,4,If you just want lowend souvenirs this is not the place to come  go to Namdaemun market instead But if you want nice antiques and higher end items then Insadong is for you Its really quite interesting to walk around
13061,5,My favorite area in Seoul The restaurants tea houses small shops street food and cleanliness Tip they show you how to make some honey sweets along the main street Dont miss it
13062,4,Very near to Alive Museum Interesting finds along the shopping street Check out the buildings and coffee houses
13063,4,very traditional area in seoul cheap souveniors shop around there you should ask for a discount
13064,4,I visited this place for shopping of traditional items of South Korea I purchased few items nice collection and art work
13065,5,This was the highlight of my daughters trip We went here 2 days and we still did not get to see all the shops we wanted to Lots to see very cheap Note the shops with air conditioning our guide told us have better quality stuff Love it here
13066,5,Pretty much a tourist area to buy and visit different stores not necessarily clothes shopping but little souvenirs and artcraft Lots of human traffic so beware of that restaurantscafessouvenir shops street vendors
13067,4,Seouls an unmistakably modern city but its done well to try to preserve the atmosphere of this old area However visitors will be mistaken to think that theyll immediately be transported into a different era when they arrive Pockets of tradition do exist including tea houses restaurants specialty shops and art galleries but theyre dotted along the main street Insadongil as well as the small side streets and alleys that branch off it In some of these establishments a sense of peace relative to the busy outside world can be found If shopping s more your thing rest assured that the area caters to this as well as most other parts of the city Some of the shops can be rather tacky but there are also interesting gems to be discovered and plenty of snack stalls are often close by to sustain the hungry traveller Some days usually on weekends some of the streets are closed to traffic This allows the festive shopping mood to really come alive for visitors Needless to say its also the most crowded time to visit so be prepared to jostle a little
13068,5,If you want to know the real Seoul you should bisit this place It has many shops that sells nice traditional souveniers and also they have nice restaurants Sometimes some people sing on the streets which is quite romantic to listen to with your girl friend
13069,5,This is the popular traditional street near the gwanghamun palace and it has a lot of traditional food and really good restaurants and cafes It is also a great place to shop for souveniers and traditional clothing
13070,4,Pedestrianonly on weekends Insadong is a great place for a stroll Prices for local good are higher here than elsewhere but the peoplewatching and gallerygoing is good value Lots of place to eat and drink down all of the side alleys where there are still bargains to be found Too many chain stores on the main alley these days for my taste
13071,5,Favorite place to stay in Seoul Winding back streets away from the trafficGo to the hold in wall shops and restaurants English isnt spoken or on menus but thats a great part of the adventur
13072,5,Quite touristy but very nice place different from the super modern and trendy Seoul a neat quick tour to the cultural side with nice small shops
13073,3,Insadong is one of the recent landmarks in Seoul and I wonder why First the positives on the alleys adjacent to the main street you can find some of the best food in Seoul Just look for my other reviews Nonetheless it is busy most of the time there is no authenticity except for a couple of shops and prices are high Bottom line a tourist trap
13074,4,Husband and I took a stroll down Insadong on a weeknight enjoying the window shopping and peoplewatching Having not really seen any souvenir shops during our visit to Seoul we did find quite a few of them here Some were selling the basic tshirts and similar stuff get what you pay for but other shops sell goods of higher quality We werent really seeing the antique shops the area is known for having but more art galleries It was nice for a lazy stroll
13075,5,We loved the small streets and unique charm that his neighborhood has We found our way there by chance and discovered later that its known for that Must see
13076,4,So I came here because so many people talked about antiques here But I did not see anything worth talking about I did see a lot of replicas for souvenirs though But maybe I was just more concerned about modern art and food which were everywhere I went to a little shopping outlet call ssamziegil or something like that and that was really cool
13077,5,We went to Insadong on the last day of our trip There are a bunch of quaint shops and restaurants along the meandering street We loved the cart food and shopping the best Be sure to try the chicken skewers the really spicy ones will set your mouth on fire
13078,5,I loved the small streets and unevenness of the little paved lanes small lights illuminating restaurants A sweet atmosphere to emanate from such a big city as Seoul is a truly nice Loved the galleries and art shops  such a great collection of two things I love  local food and art
13079,5,Lovely pedestrian only street with lots of shops selling souvenirs transitional arts and also modern artifacts and designs
13080,4,If you are staying in seoul for more than 4 nights i think this place deserve a visit from you It is very nice place for walk by sonouniers and have coffee in this street
13081,4,Nice little sidestreets to walk around with plenty little shops and restaurants  There are no cars so its nice to walk around and see whats around
13082,4,Amazing traditional shopping area with many tourist souvenirs and keepsakes There are also many street vendors Summer season that sell traditional food Popular area is the Insadong Street
13083,5,This was my favorite shopping district in Seoul above Gangam I loved the art galleries and traditional crafts and tea shops lining the lanes Foot traffic was heavy and fantastic for people watching
13084,5,A pleasant few hundred metres targeted for tourists not as cheap as the traditional markets but not as crowded There is an excellent green tea place Fabulous green tea ice cream Good restaurants on side streets  Prices for small make bags and fans are quite reasonable
13085,4,This is a small alley but it is a present buyers paradise It was here I found nice small and reasonably priced gifts for everyone on my list  from a woodblock print map of Seoul for the history lover to a necklace for my goddaughter to a cute totebag for my mom It is a tourist spot  but hey I was a tourist
13086,5,What would you expect from a tourist location Though many locals venture through the streets and alleys Wonderful assortment of pottery and tea houses at typically tourist prices Apart from this the energy and experience is a must
13087,5,Must visit place in koreaaaa Love everything here The handicraft the store You can take selfie everywhere Happy l
13088,4,This little street is really sweet Much nicer than the bigger markets more open space and relaxed More souvineers and nic nacs and less small cheap ladies clothing for which I was grateful and tacky handbags good for a nice stroll and to picj up some nice and reasonably priced gifts If you must have fridge magnets they do have them but there are some tasteful items too
13089,4,Main shopping area appears to be too touristy Resturants and shopping are a bit more expensive than myeodong or nandaemon area
13090,4,Its a nice street to walk it with mostly souvenir shops along the street But there were malls that allows you to sit on
13091,4,Most enjoyable place to hang out as the sun sets Lots of great shopping and food options Good place to end up after the Bukchon Hanok Village walk
13092,5,This is the best street for shopping we saw Pedestrian only area and some nice places you can sit up high have a beer and people watch
13093,4, and I dont like shopping Its worth stopping in and browsing A lot is for tourists but definitely not all I bought some beautiful paper from a real art supply shop
13094,3,Insadong is a great area for souvenir shopping and a few other things to do Ive visited the information center and they have a great area for hanbok pictures at a great price
13095,4,well worth 30 minutes of your time but look out for pickpockets my friend had her cell phone stolen while we were buying street food
13096,3,Not bad its good to visit to buy sivinirs and to try the traditional crafts You can go by mitro or taxi depend where you stay Its fun to walk there as there lots of poeple gathering The street is connected to many ways you can go cross
13097,5,the must please in Korea that you should not missed it Insadong the art place which keep traditional of Korea style with the contemporary many of souvenir shop and good restaurant and also the tea shop i really stay all day at Indasong 
13098,4,At face value this is just a big shopping street but if you explore the many side streets you can find interesting art galleries and nice boutique shops selling lovely arts and crafts particularly pottery It is a touristy area so is priced accordingly but it is a good place to window shop to get an idea of what is available in korea There are also lots of young hip novelty shops as well as standard tourist shops and artcraft oriented galleries so it is a nice mix There are also plenty of little restaurants to eat at You can also enjoy various street performances on the way It is a pleasant place away from shopping malls with a little of old Seoul but be warned it gets very crowded on weekends
13099,5,We enjoyed walking through this artsy neighborhood It also has great restaurants and snack type foods Coincidentally we ate at the same mandu and fresh cut noodle restaurant that is supposed to be the best in Insadong in 2012 and 2015 Every restaurant looks good get a good meal for inexpensive price
13100,4,If you are looking for arts and crafts or just want to wander around Insadong is the pace to go Dont forget to wander along the small alleyways where you will find lots of little restaurants
13101,4,It is located near the palace and Hanok village Along the road side there are many souvenirs and some nice handcrafted gifts cosmetics shops also be found in this road Near to this road there are temple and shrine which is also nice and attractive There are two as I saw photo studio that you could take a photo in nice ancient royal costumes with make up and hair dressed approx 25000 KRW per set of picture
13102,3,Geared up for cashed up locals and tourists the area still manages to convey a sense of old Seoul Just dont expect a living museum Rather than making it a destination use it as an interesting connection with lunch between palaces
13103,4,This is a great street to buy souvenirs Enjoy the cheep shops at the north end of the street and proceed to the original craft shops at the end Be careful as the shop owners dont always add up the prices correctly ;
13104,5,A variety of shops and restaurants lively atmosphere throughout the day Could take you anywhere from 20 mins to 3 hours depending if the shops have what you are looking for I had great stonepot rice lunch there so managed to buy some cheap souvenirs 
13105,5,I stayed in a hotel in Insadong The shops were wonderful and prominent young people dressed with hat and red outfits who spoke English to help you find your way around Many people also came up to you with freebies advertising the Olympics in Korea Very artistic area of Seoul and centrally located Easy to get to wherever you want to go from this location
13106,5,Insadong is just excellent for everybody whether you are a foreigner visiting to experience some hanok experience in the middle of the Seoul metropolitan area or a local Seoulite just visiting for great food They have it all from the artsy Ssamjigil to the Trick Art Museum My favorite part of Insadong is the DIY shops on the basement level of Ssamjigil; you can make your own dolls rings etc for a small fee Insadong is also home to so many great cozy restaurants and cafes If youre taller though bewareyou might not fit into some of these buildings
13107,4,Even if you have nothing in particular to buy it is worth visiting Insadong It has its own character with its row of shops and stalls for you to experience I have been to Seoul many times before but never visited Insadong I should have come before Thanks to my other significant half who planned our visit this time
13108,4,Nice place for tourists  Jogyesa is near by and this street has a lots of antique shops which i feel is quite pricey  Not sure if the antique collectors feel the same
13109,4,Insadong is a must see for anyone visiting Seoul It may be aimed at tourists but it really is a great place to visit for a bit of shopping and to try some street food Visit one of the tea houses for a great experience
13110,5,I love this place I need to go back and get some stuff There are some pretty rubbish tourist junk stalls but theres also some great traditional paintings and ceramics The small lanes running off the main road hide some nice restaurants
13111,5,Lots and lots to see Good vegetarian food sidewalk performances by street dancers abundant food tasters tourist information centers to try on hanboks vintage goods and loadsss more 
13112,4,We had our hotel here which turned out to be a great location You can easily access sights from here by foot and theres a lot to see around Insadong It was a bit of a artsy place with lots of boutiques cafes and restaurants so you can easily spent hours strolling around the streets
13113,5,this place is good for food and buy curiosities small streets with lots of small restaurants that you will enjoy visiting some places can be bit expensive but anyway you will enjoy coming to this place really enjoyable
13114,3,enjoyed that this is a pedestrian walkway but having been to many cities in Asia i found it a little too touristy and not as interesting from a historical or craft perspective
13115,4,Interesting and vibrant I can spend hours and hours walking around here The first time I came it was raining heavily and did not do much The second time I spent a few hours just walking slowly and savoring the sights Tried a few snacks and had my first cold noodle dish here
13116,5,A must do experience There is so much to see here from morning to late night Food shops and people watching
13117,3,It is nothing special You can buy there some souvenirs Restaurants are expensive and served food in only mediocre quality
13118,3,Does not compare very well to similar urban spots around the world The shops in the pedestrian area play the cute factor card to attract traffic and perhaps they are successful but they are not cheap  The whole area lacks character  there is not much authenticity here but can be explored easily in an hour or so  Insadong becomes very very crowded later in the day so I suggest you go in the morning and then go to one of the nearby museums or palaces until the evening
13119,4,Ive been visiting Insadong periodically since 1997 and have watched its transformation fomr a sleepy local antique and traditional market place to a pumping throbbing tourist hub But not all tourist hubs are automatically bad The only major influx of bad is all the trinket shops that dominate the main street but still they are loads of fun and lots of little stores and side streets full of interesting stuff The main antique stores are too expensive and dont even know if they are authentic anymore but lots to peruse through still A must visit for any first time visitor to Seoul
13120,5,I liked Insadong for all the shops were down one street which was closed to traffic Some great shops including some expensive antique shops I sampled their Osulloc free tea and purchased to take home I also purchased some of their hand made paper Most of the shops allowed you to use their toilets without having to purchase things A definite must on your stay Allow 23 hours
13121,3,I do not really understand what is the big deal about this neighbourhood I dont find anything special here just a few streets with stores which seem to be targeted to tourists
13122,4,if youre looking for souvenir before leave korea insadong is one of the best place for you i bought many traditional korea bowl and chopstick and spoon here around 2000  3000 krw can get many different cute and signature korea bag are selling spend 2 hours here for shopping
13123,4,From Bukchon walk back to Anguk station and exit 6 walk about 40m on the left is the Insadong walking street There are also many roadside eateries where you can try the local food  You can visit the Ssamziegil where all the artistic stuffs are available
13124,4,Neighborhood full of shops restaurants temples and small alley ways and streets You can wonder around entire afternoon or evening great people watch  would I go back Most likely not there are couple places that I have not have time to visit while my stay in Seoul so this will not be on my list
13125,5,A fantastic neighborhood full of shops restaurants temples school etc you will love wandering a round the small alley ways  streets Be sure to try some of the small cafes for soup  fish pancakes
13126,5,Great shops and street shopping Very lively area perfect to get all your souvenirs from Seoul The vendors were very nice and most spoke English If youre looking for craft markets and shops this is one stop shopping
13127,5,Seoul is changing rapidly and becoming a truly modern city placing up skyscrapers whenever it gets a chance However in this part of town you can still get a feel for the old Seoul with its traditional buildings and little winding streets There are a lot of tourists here but with good reason its a brilliant place to pick up food souvenirs and see a few street performers Its close to a lot of city attractions so Id make it my walk through between things rather then a must see
13128,5,Lots of artsy type stuff available here Geat place to buy inexpensive scarves  some homemade jewelry There are a couple places that sell these J shaped ice cream cones Its a MUST try The cones taste like Capt Crunch Cereal  A nice place to just stroll
13129,5,This is the place to go for crafts souvenirs and food off the street The street is bustling and old time Seoul comes alive here Great contrast to all the big fancy buildings in rest of city
13130,5,Insadong is another shopping district but has more of the tourist souvenirs and traditional and historical items for sale  We went during the daytime so it was not as busy as Myeongdong but it still had its charms  Would recommend if youre looking for some souvenirs to remind you of Korea

13153,3,Visited insadong one afternoon in December 2014 We were greeted by the colorful and interesting shop fronts and buildings Temperature was about 5 to 8 degree Celsius It would have been a very pleasant stroll and browse if there were lesser spitsfrozen spitsshop owners spitting passerby spitting Smell was rather unbearable under the December sky Cannot imagine the foul smell it it was summer
13154,5,A nice street with all sorts of shops galleries clothing bags foodnice shops interesting shops a MUST when you go to Seoul A little bit crowded on Saturdays
13155,4,Great if you love market settings  tourist prices though so things could be a little pricey than other areas but well worth going to There is a temple just round the corner which is amazing too Subway closeby

13164,4,shop for galleries traditional restaurants traditional teahouses and cafes Unique street and building structure must visit place
13165,4,Have been here for a walk Had some street food and watch the other many tourists Would recommend the dumpling at a small place in one of the side streets almost at the end of Insadong going in the direction of the palace
13166,4,This street is good for those who want to get a feel for how Korea was in the past The shops mostly sell traditional crafts like wooden masks and fans The area of the city is great for walking so you can get to other attractions like City Hall the palaces and Myeongdong without bothering with public transportation As with most places around Seoul be ready to fight the crowds And be aware that things around there tend to close early around 8 oclock or so
13167,5,Tourist Zone which is a multi storey building alongside the street shops are premium stuff tax refundable if u spend more than 30000KRW things are nice but pricey Good to go during weekdays coz weekends are back to back crowd
13168,5,Insadong is a lovely area full of little boutique shops galleries food stalls restaurants tea houses and much more My husband and I bought lots of lovely souvenirs and it was nice having a stroll along the streets particularly Ssamjigil where there is a shopping mall that spirals upwards  Also look out for a traditional tea house called Sinyetchatjip on the main street You go up stairs and this is where the tea house is located Very nice atmosphere and you have to try one of the teas with the traditional rice cakes
13169,5,I adore Insadong with its art galleries tea houses coffee places and wonderful street food and restaurants Even the touristy shops are kind of cute Make sure you wander into some of the alleys If you like dumplings there is a great mandoo place down one of the side streets You will see the steam coming from the tiny restaurant Highly recommend this area

13171,4,Lots of very nice shops selling upscale items and a good number of restaurants abound Some interesting stuff down the side streets too Worth spending a good hour or two browsing around
13172,5,this was my fav shopping experience in seoulhuge variety of little shops tea houses cafes resturants Its also a nice place to walk  wander around if you dont want to shop the best place in seoul to shop for souveniers and home stuff
13173,5,Insadong was just a walking distance from our hotel n this place was so much alive even at night Good place to buy souveniers as they were cheaper compared to other places Many good restaurants are located here We went to a vegetarian restaurant named Oh Se Gae Yung and were amazed by their food presentation and taste Highly recommended
13174,3,Consisting of several street blocks of shops and restaurants its a nice area to wander around The shops are mostly souvenir type shops Stop off here on the way back from one of the temples
13175,5,This is always my favorite shopping experience in Korea And I mean shoppingnot buying although I almost always do looking peoplewatching wandering having a cup of tea or a meal These pedestrian only few square blocks are full of culturally oriented businesses tea shops calligraphy stores art galleries ceramic galleries antique shops and interesting restaurants I always seem to find what I am looking for This time I was looking for ceramic gifts I didnt know exactly what I wanted but knew that I would know it when I saw it And just soI walked into a small gallery with a show of unusually fine functional ware and quickly spent too much money knowing also that my art buyers intuition was well satisfied It is a wonderful contrast to the mass merchandising appeal of places like the Coex Mall The one small downside is that in the last few years an influx of Mainland Chinese tourists has produced a market for cheaper stuff and cosmetics and these businesses are beginning to proliferate Im hoping that this doesnt progress much further because traditional Korea gets harder and harder to find in general
13176,5,Lovely neighbourhood full of traditional tea houses restaurants and souvenir shops Especially in the evenings it gets more crowded
13177,4,You will find a lot of interesting small shops and there are always good or mini mart round the corner for you to rest your feet and fill your stomach  Taking a taxi is pretty easy just make sure you hop on the taxi on the right side of the street if you are heading back to you hotel after your walk around  Plenty of photo taking opportunities if you are into architecture
13178,5,Michael Kim ultimatekoreatourgmailcom from UltimateKoreaTour proposed to have a free time for lunch in this area It was a great idea so people had an opportunity to choose lunch according to preferences and spend rest of the time for shopping and exploring the local culture
13179,4,Just wander around and experience the varied options of food and shopping The street food is particularly exciting  try the Octopus
13180,5,Insadong consists of several city blocks not far from the city center and other notable tourist sites There is some great shopping there and be prepared to negotiate with the vendors It is like Yu Yuan Gardens in Shanghai or Jinli Lu in Chengdu  but much bigger Well worth the experience and there are several western fastfood restaurants conveniently located nearby
13181,5,Insadong is a great place to shop for sourvenirs There are variety of sourvenirs selling key chain bag fridge magnet etc and of course skin care  make up products also available Besides there are lot of restaurants here So do not miss Insadong
13182,5,I enjoyed walking inside the streets The decoration of the street is nice and you may find it with good street furniture I spent about half day there either inside the cafe and shopping
13183,5,Ever imagined snacking away at an ice cream from both sides Or it being in a jshaped cone made from corn Or an ice cream that is 32cm long I could go on and on because if you want some crazy food this is a great place to find it And if you like crazy good finds to bring home as souvenirs here is also a good place to indulge My hot tip is the local shopping mall Go to the roof first and then meander your way down checking out all the quirky shops with beautifully handcrafted goods Artlovers will love this area too with interesting statues and shops How about a mega size painting brush for your calligraphy needs Whatever your interest this area is definitely a must see
13184,4,I really love the ambiance the cafe and the restaurant looks artsy Dont forget to visit Ssamziegil where you can find many shop selling local products Ssamziegel also has cute graffiti
13185,5,Many souvenirs stores in insadong and antique store the price is not very high and there is a ice cream store you must try You can stop at anguk station or accros the street from bukchon to insadong after you pass the park you find olive and young on your left cross the red light and you arrive at insadong enjoy your trip
13186,4,Good place to buy souvenirs to take back home Though I think it was a bit costly compared to the one we saw in Dongnaenum area And we ate in this restaurant mainly serving seolleongtang It was soo good and cheap Their kimchi was tasty too the spiciness was just right Too bad I wasnt able to recall the name
13187,5,In Insadong zou will find a bar disco or restaurant what you like There is plenty of them and also good shopping
13188,2,I have bought into the hype and went for a visit It was Saturday and very crowded Nothing special really lots of stores selling the same souvenirs and restaurants The place I have enjoyed the least in Seoul
13189,5,This is a great place to go for a walk or to do shopping I enjoyed looking at all of the art supplies hand crafted clothes masks and other souvenirs
13190,3,I normally go to Insadong to buy souvenirs Its a street full of shops and even buy some socks Super cheap 10 pairs for 5000 won
13191,5,The Insadong street is a lively place for shopping All the items you can get as souvenirs something cute and high quality things you can bring back to your family and friends are all in this street Goodluck and enjoy shopping in this area
13192,5,Stayed in this area so got to know it well Handy to major sights and small out of the way places Loved the difference in small alleyways and the food around here is great
13193,4,This hipster street just brings everything in one place Food shopping cheap too culture arts tourist spots all rolled in one Dont just visit the street check out the alleys as well Hidden there are good cheap restaurants Allot at least 35 hours and immerse yourself in shopping and culture This is definitely a great place to get lost
13194,4,Great place for an evening stroll with lots of shops selling both touristy souvenirs and also products from their local artist which are very creative Ssamziegi building which is located along the road is very well worth a visit for those who are looking for their local artist work A must go for those in Seoul
13195,5,I been Seoul twice and both times i went Insadong area many many times Merchants have a good collectible art items and price are very reasonable Many cheap gift stores and many local food restaurants
13196,4,Im crazy about tea and this seems to be the one place to find it in Seoul Its not so easy to find the ideal types of small shops one would look for Google doesnt know about many at least based on an English search so the best plan might be to give up a day just wandering I found two shops selling tea and many more cafes that looked interesting and it seemed a nice older neighborhood besides that
13197,4,I was able to find the most reasonably priced celadon vases here They have lots of traditional goodies for you to bring home Hint if you go further in away from the shops which line the main streets you can find the same items for a much cheaper price
13198,3,Just another shopping walking street but offer less varieties than Myeongdong Hongdae GotoMall in terms of goods sold and food But this is a great place to take a stroll
13199,3,Seriously eat elsewhere and drink elsewhere Most restaurants are tourist traps You can eat for better elsewhere at a lower price
13200,4,We walked down this street both during the day and night both times it was full of life At night buskers came out and during the day is when all of the shops are open for exploration There are a lot of touristy shops with plenty of souvenirs to buy as well as hand made jewelry  There are some interesting little desert stalls as well where they make unfamiliar ice creams
13201,5,This was my favorite part of Seoul I liked the feel of the streets and if you stray from the main road a bit you an see some small homes where people live There would be nightly performances from singers
13202,5,Like the crowded shops full of arts and the side alleys with restaurants Not a place for kids We started on the north side and worked our way down to Chongno
13203,3,Many things to shop around and many restaurants in the area Many coffee shops Better to come on Sunday for the free market Many food stalls
13204,5,This part of town has the best location for walking or taking a short subway ride to most of the tourist attractions in Seoul Plus the traditional shops and alleys add an authentic touch compared to the big modern mallsshops
13205,5,Insadong is THE place for souvenirs although many of the stores had pretty much the same inventory If you want more local artist made high end souvenirs make a stop at Ssamzeigil four floors of handcrafted items which is around the midpoint of Insadong You can also take a break at Osulloc a modern tea house that is also the largest tea company in Korea And of course they had nicely packaged tea which made great souvenirs
13206,4,What I like is the street itself the environment especially earlier in the morning when theres no crowd yet Lots of souvenir shops I like the restaurants at the back alley theyre pretty good except for one restaurant nearest to the Insadong Station Tourist Info Booth Its traditional entrance look good but the ginseng chicken aint fresh
13207,5,Great area for arts and crafts shopping and souvenirs If the weather is good its a great walk as the main street is closed to cars between 10am and 10pm
13208,5,Insadong is like stepping back in time Great neighborhood market shopping and browsing Also great people watching
13209,5,Lots of little quaint shops for you to shop around in for unique handicrafts and souvenirs Come here for the experience of wearing a hanbok The selection of hanboks are not as many as professional studios but they are free for trying
13210,5,ozy streets comfortable to walk with many famous restaurants and cafe small shops The people are friendly and smiling
13211,5,Please make sure to visit this place during the day Unfortunately we were there at the evening and didnt have enough time to see all of those little shops Osulloc is worth a Jeju tea time experience
13212,5,I have traveled many times to Seoul and have enjoyed many of the cultural jewels of this city and some of the wonders of the surrounding area But I am always drawn back to Insadong even just for a quick visit It is a quirky shopping area and artsy district Lots of good restaurants and the best tourist information professionals in the city Really a fun day just to walk and look and pause for coffee and food Enjoy
13213,5,Insadong is where most of my gift shopping took place but the area offers fantastic restaurants traditional tea houses street food that takes on a performance art flair and friendly shopkeepers Bargain hunters can score here if theryre mindful as many items that experience a high markup in fancy tourist shops can be found in humble street stalls for considerably less Not to be missed
13214,4,this was a fun area to walk around find some great local food go to where there are crowds of locals rather than tourists and have a few drinks snacks or a full meal It is more fun venturing into the smaller alleys for interesting food and drink venues though plenty of activity stalls and tourists along the main streets
13215,4,This is the lively shoppingfood street that comes alive at night It is a real tourist trap but is great fun There is plenty to see and do with lots of restaurants usually upstairs Try some of the street food  beware it can be very spicy try the walking cane shaped ice creams from a shop peeled curly fried potatoes on a stick from a street stall or buy some of the wonderful hand made paper and envelopes that would cost a fortune back home Maybe catch a performance on the outdoor stage at the top of the street It is also quite lively during the day
13216,4,Insadong is perfect for walking and enjoying the small shops which sell arts craftsand most importantly tea shops and houses There are small alleys where the older tea houses sit Very cute and unexpectedly calm amidst busy Seoul For cratfs there are options from as low as 2000won or USD2 for a fabric phone pouch and mini mirror to the hundreds of dollars worth of handmade bag
13217,5,For traditional celadon and other market materials or for a temple meal as we did this is a great area an easy to get to and from Although lots of tourists also lots of locals We passed so many locals with cups of their coffee from their favorite coffee shops it became a bit much but a real picture on contemporary Korea
13218,5,I loved it her grate food good shoping lots o places to see Get to know this place and find youre favorit place to eat There are so many places to choose from A must see in Seoul
13219,5,Insadong is full of small shops selling mostly tasteful gifts Its close to Jongno 3Ga station Why not walk through it up to Anguk station
13220,4,Check out the small alleys and youd find gems in there from restaurants to cafes to handicraft shops
13221,5,I love this place Its now a favorite i bought almost all of my souvenirs here so affordable The stores  boutiques are also very stylish 
13222,4,Headed here on a Sunday afternoon the place was filled with locals and the local markets The main street was busteling with people really good vibe We thought about trying to photo bomb every selfie we saw but would never have gotten out of the place  There are heaps of shops stalls galleries and places to eat  Highly worthwhile for any trip to soul
13223,4,We did not buy anythingas we had 2 weeks of travel ahead of us and no space to carry but lots of stuff you could buy and lots of food you could try which we did
13224,3,Insadong is a nice set of streets and alleys with various shops selling souvenirs It is not hugely different to any other such area in East Asia and you can find the same kind of stuff they sell there in almost any of the neighbouring countries Having said that it is a nice area and worth visiting
13225,5,A shoppers delight wander along the main drag for souveniers pottery crafts Dont neglect the side streets where more shops and wonderful little tea houses and restaurants can be found
13226,3,After reading all the other reviews on this place it was highly recommended but I didnt feel like it was worth the bother The staff they sell here can be found cheaper at other shopping locations
13227,1,Insadong is totally not worth it in my opinion It has changed a lot since my first visit in 2009 I went back recently with my parents to show them around and almost had a heart attack Not much originality left Chain coffee shops and snack shops all over the place Very disappointed
13228,4,This is a highly touristy street but there are many galleries that you might want to check out because of their high qualities There are also shops of higher qualities everywhere inbetween shops selling cheap stuff Do check out Tongin gage
13229,3,You can buy some traditional gift on this street Not so crowded on the night you can enjoy walking and try the street food
13230,3,Lots of restaurants in the small alleys Many shops selling local souvenirs Very pedestrian friendly Close to Cheongdeokung exit 6 from the subway
13231,4,Its a pretty cool place lots of touristy things to buy prices vary on some things from store to store so you should look around We had no issues after eating a few versions of the street foods offered best to come and go via the subway as parking is scarce and expensive
13232,5,There are many interesting shops which sells old or traditional stuffs Also there are many restaurants and also many different places to drink a cup of tea Normally so many people are here as the other popular places
13233,5,Great so much fun Visit the 4 story artists mall Everything in the stores had made by the artists we went twice back while in Seoul
13234,4,Neat shopping area with food boutiques and tourist souvenir junk Still worth a go for the people watching and food options
13235,4,Nice place to visit There are dozens of art galleries and shops that selling art there You can easily see some street performers performing on street This is the place that i am sure you would love to check out if you like cultures and arts
13236,5,Tons of things in this street High quality souvenir shops museums cafe traditional food  dessert shops handicrafts etc Also have 2 branches of Trick Eye Museum Alive Museum as well
13237,5,Found an artisan mall With a store called one of a kind Worth the whole trip The quality in all the shops in that particular mall was outstanding
13238,4,Insadong is great for a walk around museums and shops However the shop prices are vastly inflated and you can buy for cheaper elsewhere Do try to haggle as the prices are always negotiable and should be Also around that area the food is pretty poor compared to other areas and once again is way overpriced But its a great spot to have a walk around and always has street performers throughout the day
13239,5,its the place to go for anything thats more traditional and for things that are made in Korea a lot of traditional tea houses and cafes to choose from still has the old charm left
13240,5,At first glance Insadong looks more touristy than it is There are lots of small independent cafes street food vendors art galleries and shops Its worth taking a whole afternoon to sample everything and explore all the nooks and crannies
13241,5,Dynamic full of fun tasty and much more Should not miss
13242,5,Its an interesting touristy place to visit in Seoul if you are bored of shopping and eating They have a lot of independent shops set up by local artists  you can get some unique souvenirs here
13243,5,Dont be afraid by the big labels around here; we were really surprised by the bargains on clothing to be had here Now how i wished we had allocated more time for shopping in Seoul as I had no idea that we could have done so well on clothing with brand names
13244,2,its not so ancient anymore But still worth a visit Got some cute buys  Can use the seoul city tour bus hop on hop off to go there
13245,4,I found that the price are cheaper than other places even though they were still expensive but hey dont be so stingy for loved ones
13246,4,The shop keepers were in general friendly and not pushy and many spoke English; the staff in inns and eating places did not always but they were always helpful Insanedong is a peaceful area to enjoy
13247,5,I came to this place on a beautiful Sunday afternoon as according to the weather forecast it will snow on later afternoon so I spent about 2 hours here before heading to Samcheongdong for the beautiful snowing scene Do not walk along the Main Street of Insadong you have to be adventurous enough to walk into those small lanes where there have nice little cafe and shops and some graffiti Before I headed to Samcheongdong it had start snowing and Insadong is a nice place to enjoy snow walking the crowd on Sunday just perfect and I like Paris Croissant cafe and Starbuck in this area cos the interior for these 2 cafes are unique
13248,4,Loved this place Has a little bit of everything clothes souvenirs food Good for tourists but a little of the expensive side
13249,4,Personally did not find anything particularly exciting here but due to the proximity to my hotel it was a nice place to stroll around and see what the little shops lining the streets had to offer
13250,5,If you are visiting or live in Korea and you love ART this is the place to GO Galleries shops live music restaurants street vendors etc The cultural atmosphere was great If I go back to Korea a visit to Insadong is way up there in my Things to do list
13251,4,It is an amazing place to shop if you know where to go Yes there are some shops that are a bit to expensive but also a lot of shops that are cheap Ok Hongdae is cheaper as an example but still great Sinsa is way more expensive So if you like the middle way and also enjoy the palace and Bukchon Village this is an amazing day to do
13252,5,history street near the gwanghwamun and gongbukgeoung palace food here is cheaper compared to myeongdong
13253,4,The recent visit makes me feel the streets has been revived and gave me a pleasant trendy feel TIP  To visit take Line 3 and alight at ANGUK 328 subway station
13254,4,Its a lot different than Myeongdong The place is rather upmarket so our guide warn us that this is a nobargain street Good to hangout for the cafes and place to eat around there Beware of stuck up Ahjumma whom is cold and dislike you for touching stuff inside her shop But other seems okay I didnt buy anything here as its a little expensive we just eat round here  the best grilled fish we had its touristy had a lot of seller spoke in my mother tongue at least the basicslol
13255,4,If u are looking for souveniers this is the place Their souveniers are slightly cheaper compared to other area

13258,3,Insadong is a street that one shouldnt miss  take in the many restaurants souvenir shops and street vendors In the end however its just that a collection of shops aimed at tourists If youre looking for architectural highlights or historical sights look elsewhere

13261,4,The whole place is an old village Architecture is really good People are friendly We just roamed about the place esp the Bukchon Village A lot of walking but we didnt feel tired at all
13262,4,Generally a touristfriendly place But that also means things are a little pricey I came across many interesting sights but personally I didnt have much to buy there
13263,5,Love this place so much I was almost unable to control myself not to buy those pretty bookmarks traditional pottery pearl jewelry box and so on and so on Besides individual shops there are some commercial buildings that house the shops inside The food there is also amazing though a bit expensive compared to other area in Seoul but hey youre in Insadong I found a shop that sells antiques at one of the alleys there A must visit when you are in Seoul

13266,4,A popular tourist shopping and dining area of Seoul I did not spend that long here as I am more of an explorer than a shopper but there are some interesting sights here such as traditional writing brushes masks and clothing and some interesting craft and art shops Also lots of cafes and traditional things to snack on Explore the side streets as well as the main road and do pay the very beautiful Jogyesa Temple a visit whilst in the area See my separate temple review
13267,5,I enjoyed going to Insadong It is very unique and special There is a lot of shopping culture and people There are many roads as well
13268,4,Crowded Full of souvenirs Shops Nearby everything My good rating is because I found a dumplings shop in one of the alleys and they were extreme
13269,5,all sorts of people here Be careful of the minimart and the G25 shops they will charge foreigners more if yiu are unfamiliar with the discounts
13270,4,Insadong is a street lined with traditional stuffs could be more for tourists who want something more traditional and not the usual cosmetics and clothings sales that you can find elsewhere
13271,4,Although is just another street like Myeongdong but this has more things to see instead of cosmetics clothing etc Some shops along the side alleys are rather unique with long queue of customers Easily accessible as its near to subway station
13272,3,I like strolling through the streets enjoying all the street food and arts Nice place to buy souvenirs Absolutely love the traditional atmosphere
13273,4,This is a place for local art and food The atmosphere is good and I reallu like Seoul these days as they have tourist staff everywhere to help you fing what you want They have little shops that selling local art design and feel free to browse around The restaurant there are unique and less crowded as in Myeong Dong
13274,4,Stayed in Insadong Enjoyed the performances street food and general buzz here particularly on weekends Did more window shopping than actual shopping
13275,4,I liked the vibe here lots of shops selling tourist souvenirs and nice restaurants in the alleyways go for the ones that are fairly crowded
13276,5,what can I say everything that you imagine in Seoul for eating shopping and hanging out is just right here in Insadong 5 hours is not enough maybe 2 days
13277,4,I stay neared the Insadong during the visit in Korea A nice place where you can find many type of souvenir and a lot of restaurant over there I pretty like this place
13278,4,I was lucky to get a glimpse of excitement in Insadong they have many cafes and eateries as well as interesting art and craft love the little cafe library on the second story of Insadong try their local snacks Restaurants are pricey and not really delicious
13279,5,Amazing shops a stones through away from hotel Safe and reasonably prized stores and markets A great variety of food i Various restaurants
13280,4,We took the subway based on TAs suggested self tours and found the street in no time Its touristy but at least everything is in one place and its not too crowded There are a lot of shops selling the same cheap stuff but there are a few gems in there Try the multistory mall for some interesting local artist products Plenty of tea houses and restaurants
13281,3,nice place for tourists during the day for drinking at nightbut does not live up to its reputation 
13282,4,I liked the variety of shops on this street but I didnt see any antique stores as expected Perhaps down the side streets There are many tourist shops here but its fun to look and the comedy antics of the kings biscuits sellers are quite hilarious They will do a whole routine in an effort to get you to buy some which we did Quite delicious Eat them all the day you buy them or refrigerate I live in Seoul and have not seen these elsewhere We bought amethyst jewelry at one of the shopsyou can bargain at most stalls and shops I believe Worth a stroll and a look unless it is just too hot and humid for you
13283,4,This is a good place to shop for everyone Families art and antique shoppers  those looking for kitschy little souvenirs to take back to friends  relatives There are also many restaurants go down the stairwells to below street level for many of the best Also look for the vendors selling ice cream made with liquid nitrogen Its a show as well as a treat
13284,4,We walked through Insadong on a Saturday and the street is packed with people shopping and people performing It is a great place to shop for souvenirs hand crafted products  there are also a lot of eateries
13285,4,This place has han amazing bibimbap restaurant called Gogung Also has cool antique and crafty shops
13286,3,quanit shops selling souvenir doesnt have pushy store clerks like Myeundong nice friendly store owners
13287,3, Too crowded  Too Expensive  Most souvenir shops carry the same items and sell them for different prices look around first  Not very traditional anymore  Very much get in get out attitude from most store owners  Cheapish atmosphere   Haggle is possible  Some restaurants on the back streets are really good among the best in Seoul  Some really good food stands on the streets but you have to try your luck
13288,5,Feel relaxing when slow walk in here Here is a place with traditional Korea culture but you also can see the creativity The shops selling something special like hand made decoration ladies accessories etc Sometimes has performance if you are lucky
13289,5,I was able to spend about 1 hour touristing around Insadong So many art galleries Lots of friendly faces and a combination of both nice and kitchie items for shopping  My visit was part of a longer tour of the city In retrospect I wish Id just gotten a cab there and avoided the rush of getting back on the tour bus
13290,4,Seoul has a ton of shopping but Insadong offers more original crafts and shopping than the regular markets and malls Ive been back three times and always find something I love Mind you some of the stalls are a bit pricey depending on what they sell but Ive always been happy with the purchase My personal favourite are the handmade paper lamps beautiful and they make great gifts I prefer Insadong to the chaos of the megacomplex of Myendong where there may be more mainstream shopping but with things you could get anywhere Insadong is definitely worth a visit
13291,4,Very nice and charming place to spend an afternoon shopping or window shopping Buy soveniors or street art at reasonable a price Lots of eateries around
13292,3,Insadong has changed alot over the last few years The chain stores and big coffee shops have moved in but its still a nice place to visit There are a lot of antique stores and craft shops I recommend going during a weekday as weekends are extremely busy
13293,4,There are some nice galleries and shopping here We did notice that a lot of the shops had the same thing for sale but there are a few with unique items The prices are pretty reasonable for most things You could easily spend hours here browsing and snooping In some stores you can bargain the price down There are restaurants here as well
13294,5,Well I am not sure if it is authentic or not but it is a neighborhood worth visiting Go cruise through the small streets and alleys and get a real feel for Seoul Good place to buy souvenirs A short walk from the Gyeonbokgung palace
13295,5,Not far from eujiro1 station or myeongdong area Insadong street is a vibrant loud colorful crowded and festive place lots to see and full of great street food Great day out for tourists dates and family outings The street vendors are friendly very helpful to explain culture etc Great place to buy souvenir for friends and family would recommend a visit if in the area
13296,4,Spent a quiet midweek afternoon strolling from Seoul Station to Insadong To have a really scenic walk follow the trail along the remade Urban Stream or Cheonggyechon  You will walk past some open air Art Gallery Wooden benches at the side walk for you to stop and admire the gardens by the stream paintings on the walls illustrating the history of Old Korea Before you know it you arrive at the edge of Insadong next to the temple You will see little kiosks selling artistic gifts like bronze bells ceramic cups and tea pots calligraphy pieces There are also really famous artists who open their pottery workshop thereTake your time to browse Then have a nice cup of green tea at the award winning Olsutuc  if I am right  green tea cafe  and try their equally fabulous green tea tiramisu There Your afternoon is complete 
13297,4,We went here on our second time to Seoul Since we already went to the other attractions last time we had an afternoon to spare here  The place is full of quaint little shops selling traditional wares and funky trinkets We were able to buy stainless steel bowls at a reasonable price The cute trinkets though can be a bit pricey but then again youre paying for the novelty and creativity  Not exactly the best shopping destination in Seoul but it is great for a nice stroll
13298,5,If you have the chance to spend the afternoon on Insadong street do it Its a loud crowded and festive scene Theres street performers and tons of street food options It feels really safe too Maybe I should have been but I wasnt worried about pick pocketsit wasnt that kind of crowd Lots of families and teenagers on dates The shopping is mostly touristy crap but its cheap and fun There are several good skin caremakeup shops there They give you lots of freebies with your purchase so make sure to ask The street vendors expect you to haggle with them a little
13299,5,If you want to see a great market in Seoul Insadong is the place to go So much happening great shopping and street food of all kinds
13300,4,Old school food and shopping in a very comfortable and tourist friendly setting Must enjoy the funky coned ice cream Every kind of cuisine available
13301,5,It is the place to shop for souvenir items arts  crafts herbal productsetc You name it they have it at super bargain prices as compared elsewhereThere are also a lot of good restaurants when youre done shopping Its also interesting to go through the whole street lined with shops  see everything  be amazed Since its a tourist area be prepared to be in a crowd of people
13302,4,A good place for old village shots in the centre Souvenir shopping is also good in this place A bit crowded sometimes but it wont bother you Its a short walk from the train station
13303,5,ice ice babe welove the boxed candy which can be frozen and eaten fresh for a month or longerit is a show stopper in its own Just walk up and up and enjoyed window shopping with tons of trinkets to include young love written to be displayed
13304,5,A great place to see arts and crafts I think you need a whole day here I especially liked the Ssamjigil Shopping place Dont miss it It was very interesting I especially liked the handmade journals metal sculpture indie jewelry printed paper products and unusual crafts There was one store just filled with all sorts of brushes of different kinds Lots of galleries A dont miss place
13305,4,There are a few laneways worth exploring especially for the temple food and tea houses but most of the action is on the main street Weekends while busier are more fun with street vendors performers and event popup sales Best place to buy gorgeous hanji paper and any art supplies Many stores sell seasonally so in autumn youll find scarves on sale and sun hats in spring Lots of touristy souvenirs if youre interested and foreigners are common so theres a bit more English and a bit less staring
13306,5,This is the best place to eat  whether high end bebimbob or Flea market shopping food stalls souvenir shops beautiful girls attired in traditional dress doing classic dances at the culture center Its very crowded but well worth the visit We visited it twice because we liked it so much Never a dull moment
13307,5,Love this place with its artsyfartsy atmosphere in the air Manage to catch a street performance at Ssamziegil and lots of cute trinkets here I believe the young ones will definitely enjoy this place Lots of food outside and street delicacies Wont mind coming back here again one of these days
13308,2,A lot a small shops selling everything from hello kitty to hand made dolls Good local field if you like spicy food Nice for a walk through but more Nick nack shopping then traditional
13309,4,Quite a delight to visit if you like to walk the streets of Seoul and do some window shopping and chill out in any of the coffeeshops all over the area Definitely a must go as it is just next to the Anguk Station  I also posted up a photo of the tourist map that shows the area Happy shopping
13310,5,My friends and I had a great time in Insadong Food and shopping Food and shopping Need I say more Oh and its pretty inexpensive too
13311,4,A great shopping area  lots of cafes Especially the dog cafe was great A store with socks for 1000 won each Very cheap and very very crowed In the evening are there a lot of extra small shops in the streets with different kinds of street food Squid chicken sweets and much more A great place to spend too much money and all in all an amazing experience
13312,5,Insadong is open air shopping where you can find souvenirs galleries and traditional arts and crafts Atmosphere is very different to Myeongdong Highly recommended
13313,4,Nice strolling street if you like artistic and cultural things Pricing not cheap esp if you are looking at cultural items If you are looking for more localized shopping area Namdemum is a better place
13314,4,The shops in Insadong is a little bit different with more arts and culture aspects Most of the shops display handmade handicrafts or their own brand I thought it was a tourist street but vehicles could still access the street Theres a shop that sell tea leaves and one of their green tea won top the prize in an international competition
13315,4,So many interesting traditional teas I like jujube tea and omija tea the best about 8000 won each Their green tea lattes are not bad too Osulloc sells these traditional teas and more Osculloc sells good quality green tea powder in a screw bottle airtight for about 30000won 60g Really good
13316,4,This is the main touristic street of Seoul and it has lots of souvenir shops art stores and traditional eateries Also just close to the Jogyesa temple in the street which runs parallel to Insadong there is a small place in which you can rent and wear a hanbok for 20 minutes for 3000 KRW This would be an unforgettable experience for foreigners You can take lots of photos in 20 minutes One more thing dont forget to buy ice cream from the Turkish ice cream shop at the Insadong intersection The icecream guy has lots of funny tricks for you and it is really hard to take the ice cream from his hands Just try and see and burst into laughter
13317,5,Insadonggil and the surrounding labyrinth of alleyways surrounding it is a must Coffee shops galleries boutiques gallor Go on the weekend when they close the street to cars and it becomes s pedestrian haven Enjoy a coffee and sweet from a second or third floor coffee shop and soak in the ever changing atmosphere below
13318,3,If youre interested in cultural stuff this is a good place to walk around If youre into shopping most of the shops here sells basically similar things and similar prices If youre interested to explore the alleys then this area is a great place to explore There are many side alleys with hidden gems waiting for you to discover
13319,4,Insadong is a very interesting location to visit in Korea It is full of shops of Korea culture a nice place to shop for souvenir and have a relaxing meal in local restaurant It is suitable for most visitors except family very young ones of less than 5 years old
13320,3,A place for tourists prices are higher compared to markets in Seoul that sells souvenirs I would recommend more Namdemun market
13321,5,really busy on weekends with tourist everywhere the traditional teahouse i visited and the fusion restaurant was excellent
13322,5,This is the old centre of Seoul The main street Insadonggil is lined with shops and restaurants Look for the people in red shirts and red cowboy hats they have information and detailed maps of Insadong
13323,5,Any tourist to Korea should stop by Insadong If you are not already staying at the brilliant and affordable Hotel Sunbee around the corner this place is a must see Its not necessarily exciting but for all those stretched for time and in need of souvenir fixes this is like Mecca Find all the typical souvenirs that delight a tourists heart without the overly trashy and sleaze associated with Tourist shopping hot spots you will find in places like Barcelona or even London Prices are reasonable most shopowners are open to bartering and there are some truly beautiful pieces of art on display recommended are the mask shops towards Gyeongbokung end of the street  Abundant with tea houses close to Bukcheon and all of the 5 palaces of Seoul and some nifty little restaurants and coffee houses its a Seoul microcosm all in its own right
13324,5,Insadong is great for tourist shopping youll find many gift and souvenir shops and traditional clothing and street food its also a nice walk and you will see some cultural exhibitions once there dont forget to visit one of the palaces near by and the lovely residential district just a few steps away from Anguk metro station
13325,5,Good location to explore the city from Lots of fun little boutiques walking distance to palaces and the markets Lots of great food eats too
13326,5,Insadong is definitely a tourist area but if you can look past the tourists its fantastic I go to Insadong for the art galleries food and atmosphere as well as the niknacks to send home to friends and family Definitely delve into the side streets dont just stick to the main street as the side streets have interesting antique stores and some very good eateries Ive been into many of the galleries as well and they always have a wide range of styles and artists representedshowing changing artists often enough that theres something new every time I go
13327,4,I real dont like places that are crawling with tourists and this is That said get local by asking or observing where locals eat Go deep into alleys Also go to other parts of town to eat in other food alleys Everyone seems to eat out all the time there so there are lots of possibilities
13328,5,Pretty sure Asa means awesome but not quite too sure lol Came too to Insadong with some newly made friends from Seoul and Paris and was astonished at the atmosphere here Lots of things going on everywhere and my brain was getting overloaded Lots of stores to shop for cultural items as well as new things too Great place to people watch and to observe the beauty of Seoul
13329,3,Many delicious street foods here Stuffs are cheap but not that wellmade You can find this kind of stuff in Thailand or China in cheaper price A bit too crowded so its not good if you are with kids because they can get lost easily
13330,5,I like going to Insadong because I have a favorite temple food restaurant I like to go to in addition to a favorite tea shop where I frequent yearly
13331,4,Much like getting lost in Venice is an experience getting lost in Insadong is an experience in and of itself With so many interesting side streets theres always an cool crafts shop or a neat traditional tea house just around the corner Leaving the crowded main street here for the inner streets is a lot of fun Although it is an area known for buying traditional souvenirs they did not attract us much The more appealing options are the jewellery made by local artists in the Ssamziegil complex and along some of the inner streets Since this is so close to Changdeokgung it is only natural to come here after the palace visit for a nice stroll and tea 
13332,4,After all the serious shopping in Namdaemun and Myeongdong It was a nice change shopping in Isadong Enjoyed looking into galleries and craft shops admiring all the the lovely handiworks The restaurants were less crowded so we did not feel the rush but enjoyed a slow and relaxed meal  Isadong felt like a real holiday just taking our time people watching and taking a slow stroll visiting handmake crafts shops  When in Seoul do not give Isadong amiss
13333,5,I stayed at Ibis Ambassador Insadong and I could go walking to the Insadong shopping area The shopping area is amazing I loved it So much variety to shop and eat Amazing You cant go to South Korea without checking Insadong area Great Great
13334,5,If you like arts and craft go here From antiques to contemporary art Very reasonable prices Also just a nice stroll
13335,5,Fun place to shop Geared for tourists but is a fun way to spend an afternoon Be sure to try some of the local street food too
13336,4,We took a cab from our hotel Westin Chosun to Insadong The fare is less than KRW5000  This place is really interesting If you are someone who loves handicrafts youll like it a lot here The streets are filled with vendors selling all kinds of handicrafts and street food Then there is this building which is probably 45 storey high with all the shops being housed in a spiralling order We were there during their holiday so the place was quite crowded There are many shops there where you can find nice gifts  souvenirs We bought a customised musical box for our little girl  We had a nice dinner at one of the many restaurants there and finally we walked back to our hotel via the cheonggyecheon stream
13337,5,A place where you can find tradition arts and crafts pottery and even traditional tea houses Lots of souvenirs shops there to pick up some items for family and friends
13338,5,Great place for sightseeing plus shopping  can get a little touristy in the weekends but overall a nice place to walk through the main street One can also see and get traditional cultural goods eg bags clothes Ssamsigil is a nice place to visit  go round and round the walkway until you reach the rooftop and get your angel wings  youll know what I mean when you see it
13339,5,My favorite place to shop Insadong has a ton of antique stores and tea houses I love to wonder on the street there it gives you a feel of what old Korea must have been like you always seen the unusual here also
13340,4,Insadong is a tourist trap But it is a charming tourist trap with some quaint shops decent restaurants and cool street performances to see Definitely worth a visit when you are in Seoul
13341,4,Like Traditional goods prices are avarege and very good srrounding markets also most seelers speaks English Disliked Most Shops close by 56 pm you have to barginig for cheaper price or discounts
13342,5,There are lots of shops and restaurants There are lovely treasure finds Its a bit busy most of the time
13343,4,This street is really good for cheap souvenirs if your into that kind of thing I also found a good kitchen shop where I got some tableware for very cheap prices Its not a huge street but its definitely busy full of places of eat and shops I ate here twice and you really have to be careful as one of the places I ate made me very unwell for a few days Good if your walking from some of palacestemples back through to Jongno way and fancy a bite to eat Some good street eats along here as well Worth a look but very touristy
13344,5,Shop Till You Drop for the Ladies great place to buy souvenirs  and lots of kpop stuff
13345,3,Nice street with art crafts and tourist souvenir shops However much of this stuff you can get elsewhere in the city as well so Im not sure its the must visit place some describe it as
13346,5,We came here for lunch after visiting the Hanok village and one of the nearby palaces There are lots of restaurants and shops The shops range from boutique to simple cafes Young people floc to the area giving it a dynamic vibe One of the most enjoyable neighborhoods in Seoul that we visited
13347,5,Great area in the centre of Seoul Lots of restaurants bars and shops Antiques souvenirs clothingjust about anything Love the fact that the street is closed to traffic so one can freely venture around Lots to see in the side streets alleys as well so do not stay just in the main throughway  There was some street performers too which added another element of fun to the experience
13348,4,Insadong is the perfect place for souvenir shopping You can also find restaurant cafe arts crafts and food stalls there Do try the OSulloc tea shop and cafe and hotteok sweet pancake with brown sugar filling  When shopping for souvenir do try to bargain and shop around as most shop carry the same products
13349,4,I liked the various art shops; this is the place to get artistic stuff and see street baskers and artists Very interesting and happening place

13352,5,Although I am not a big shopper I quite enjoyed the vibe of this district even with the rain about We stopped for dinner and lunch inside this district on two days and was not let down Wall to wall shopping and food is the best way to describe this area There are also local tourist maps in English and access to ATM Machines Although most seem to only give you 100 USD at a time in 10000won increments
13353,4,If you like to buy art and antique new porcelain this is the place you should go The are has also many shops selling accessories such key chain painting and souvenir The price is reasonable and if you are lucky you can have a good bargain
13354,4,Very upmarket street Lovely to visit  nice art work  pottery Food places also MacDonald Also souvenir shops Seats scattered around nice for people watching Well worth a visit
13355,3,This area is full of souvenir shops where you can buy plenty of items ranging from expensive teapots to random plastic tat The street is very busy but if you take a sidestreet you quickly find yourself in a quieter area  There are plenty of places to eat around here including vegetarian restaurants Being in the tourist area the prices seem to double in comparison to the street running parallel  If you want gifts or to see an art gallery then this is a good place
13356,5,Love the culture and art environment You can find many good local souvenirs around Some of the shops offer great items with great price So do find out those hidden gems
13357,4,This place is very artsy  pop art shops caricatures handcrafted souvenirs There is a nice Buddhist vegetarian restaurant called Sanchon which also serves amazing rice wine btw  Spend an afternoon walking along the alleys and immerse in the artsy culture of Korea
13358,3,It is a nice walking street full of tourist shops to buy souvenirs the alleys surrounding it have more appeal narrow streets full of restaurants and nice traditional houses Pretty stroll but enough to walk down the street once
13359,3,The atmosphere in Insadong is great  I got a glimpse of a number of live performers Even those selling sweets put on a show It is busy and there is nothing overly unusual about what you can buy there It must be said that the prices of the trinkets were lower here than anywhere else in Busan or Jeju
13360,4,Dont expect muchbut it is a nice stroll through the trinket shops and hawkers  Cafes and coffee shops aboundlook down the side alleys for some awesome food options for quite cheap
13361,5,This is the perfect place to buy souvenirs and gifts to bring home for friends or relatives There were stores plus little tables out on the sidewalks selling items There were coffee shops restaurants and ice cream shops with unusual sellections that were delicious It is very crowded and you need two to three hours to wander around to appreciate the area
13362,5,Many kind of souvenirs sold cheap there you can even bargain or they will give you discount without you asking if you buy more than 3 items
13363,3,After walking in Myeongdong and Namdaemun wasnt as excited by Insodong It was just ok Liked the stores and deals better at other places
13364,4,This area was close to my hotel so I was able to explore it several times Lots of interesting galleries and shops containing lots of art and crafts Many interesting food opportunities as well Some street performers at times A good place to find small trinkets to take home for friends and family

13368,5,If you are the person are loving art this is the place you should not miss it It is the place where the majority local and western tourist who like to visit Full of artistic feel around and make visitor can feel relax and enjoying during shop along This is not a good place for shopping where majority gather all artistic material such like drawing clay and some hand made products
13369,5,we bought lots of celadon pottery and souvenirs while here the people were so friendly i just wish we could have stayed longer
13370,3,This is one of the densest areas of the world that Ive ever been in Theres wall to wall people in the shopping area and it could be a little overwhelming I was able to buy a bunch of souvenirs for my friends and family here but I probably wont return if Im back in Seoul
13371,4,Lots of great shopping of more tradtional products such as art and pottery Many restaurants street food and of course traditional tea houses

13374,4,Its a tradisional market and the street is closed to traffic on Sundays You get to experience a lot of tradisional food and we tried out at 2 of the restaurants there and the food was delicious  Recommended to go there as the things sold there are different from the other shopping streets

13379,4,Insadong is basically an eclectic shopping area with lots of traditional restaurants geared towards tourists We explored the Ssamgil building which is a four story winding mecca of expensive handmade boutiques
13380,4,This is one of the best places for tourist shopping Several of the shops sale the same thing so dont always buy from the first shop you see This wasnt exactly the best place for food although you can get you some nice things to munch on To help tourist out there is an information center located at each end of the street Happy shopping
13381,5,Art street tea houses tourists souveniers  Insadong has it all I enjoy the tea houses the most and particularly in winter

13389,4,If you go on a Sunday  no cars just pedestrians strolling through a great authentic shopping street This area has a mix that covers the ages From old antique shops that line the alleys through to the young fashion shops along the main drag There must be something for everyone look out for the boys making the Kings Dessert  their performance surely the next West End show Worst ways have a coffee in one of the many many coffee emporiums and watch the world go by
13390,4,The place is best to visit during Sundays since they close the road for traffic and more vendors will setup around the street You will find a lot of traditional items that you can take home as souvenir of your trip Youll also enjoy some street arts around and cheap street foods There are also a lot of restaurants and cafes around When youre done with your shopping cross the main street near Anguk Station and it will lead you to Bukchon and Samcheondong area for a great view of traditional hanok houses and lovely cafes
13391,4,It feels like in Londons Shoreditch once I stepped in Insadong area There are boutiques and restaurants offer you an unique experience Some arts installation are appeared in few spots

13393,4,i love the melting pot ambience where you can find every thing from a traditional art to a modern art items
13394,4,The Insadong area of Seoul is the older quaint part of town It is part of the Jongno district of Seoul The Main Street that everyone gravitates to is InsadongGil which runs from Tapgol Park near Jongnoga up to Angkuk dong Off this street Gil are many small alleys filled with small shops restaurants and tea shops This area is very crowded when people leave work 5600 till about 900 when lots of shops start closing down 1000 or so on weekends and later for some restaurants and bars It has a huge amount of cosmetic and skin care shops which are all very competitive A great place to shop if looking for these items Please see my previous review for more info I enjoy staying in this area and walking this street It is always fun Lots of performers on weekends but be warned it is very crowded
13395,5,I went here with my mother and some friends We walked around a bought gifts for friends and family back home The area is beautiful Every where you turn there is something to see and buy We wanted to see if we could find an old tea house  it wasnt hard they are everywhere we picked one that was super small but beautiful I ordered a pear and quince tea my mother ordered a simple green tea We sat in a small section with a huge window looking out on to the busy street the atmosphere was lovely and felt nostalgic for times long since past The hostess showed us the proper way to prepare tea The tea was delicious We spent hours walking up and down the street There were street performers in the square and even a small temple not to far up I love this place and I go back often The lantern festival is a must
13396,3,I would say this is a must visit for first time travellers to Seoul It is bustling with activity and boasts a festive atmosphere especially on weekends when the roads are closed to traffic Besides souvenirs and antiques there are some good buys like bags and snacks Just bear with jostling with the huge crowd
13397,5,Full of souvenir shops cosmetic stores Cafes money changers and restaurants Usually comes alive in the afternoon with plenty of tourists
13398,5,A really enchanting place with beautiful architecture and artistic atmosphere Perfect for souvenir hunting
13399,5,Only there a few days but it is great for eating and shopping the place is very lively and it is good spot to catch a beer or coffee and watch the world seoul  pass by
13400,3,Very touristy shops selling a lot of souvenirs and antiques The atmosphere is festive especially on weekends But many items are priced for tourists
13401,4,Yeap touristy like there is no tomorrow BUT I really loved Insadong and went back again for more photo ops of random shops and people there was a cafe i was looking for and I couldnt find it apparently its on the 2nd floor and they let little birds fly around while you drink your coffee if anyone has been here let me know what it was like lol  The majority of the shops are really touristy souvenir shops so i would suggest to buy them from here as they seemed to be reasonably priced similar to other places around seoul
13402,2,I thought I would see lots of antique shops here but it mostly seems to have tourist souvenir shops Maybe I didnt go looking far enough I gather there are tea shops too but I didnt come across much in InsadongGil the Main Street
13403,4,Insadong is decisively not the cheapest place to go on a souvenirhunt however if you see some small ceramics or artisanmade objects which you like  jump on them Nearly everything is handmade and wont be found enywhere else Also in Insadong Tourist Information point you can try on traditional clothes for an extremely low sum and take photos on a background of a real old traditional building and not a poster of a building as in most of the places
13404,4,Higher quality products here than other markets Nice pottery Was very crowded but it was a public holiday Some shops are air conditioned which was nice on a 31oC day Most shops take credit cards as well
13405,4,I only walked on the main street which is design for tourist I found that the souvenirs in Insadong have a larger variety then other places The sign for the alley are very traditional I guess it is worth exploring
13406,5,Could say a little touristy I would say great action and activity Place was buzzing and had a lot of fun Of course can tuck into many nice little restos and cafes Dont hesitate to spend a few hours sauntering down this nice little street and area
13407,5,I go to Insadong everytime I visit Seoul There are a lot of traditional tea houses restaurants shops selling traditional and modern crafts and interesting things If you want to buy some traditional items as souvenirs this is the place to go The price is higher than in Namdaemun but the things in Insadong are of much better quality and variations
13408,4,You can walk to maijor places or take a taxi to most of famous shopping centre with low cost I had stayed 4 nites at this area and quite enjoin with this location especially at night you can take some local bbq food with Sochu Wine This is also good place to buy sourvenirs for family or friends
13409,4,Insadong is worth a visit when stopping by Seoul for a few days The shops are full of various souvenirs and a wide range of stuff at various prices can be purchased here for those needing that small gift for someone back home  There are many shops and restaurants in the area as well as a few tea houses I liked the museum of tea in one of the alley ways as we always stop by to pick up something there when we visit  Total visit doesnt take more than a hour or two if you are browsing in many of the shops
13410,4,Insadong is one of a kind You will never get bored strolling around its street there are so many different items and I had fun just looking and admiring them I did not buy any of it though There are volunteers around to ask if you get lost but you wont It is a nice place to stop buy
13411,5,you have to go to the traditional tea house We really enjoyed just walking up and down the street It doesnt take long unless you go in every single shop
13412,4,We love walking around Insadong The shops have so much to offer though expensive If you are an arts person this is recommended to be part of your itinerary
13413,4,Insadong is a great suburbcity in seoul  Lots of shopping and food areas it can get really busy on the weekends  I recommend you probably need a few hours here
13414,4,Many shops in the area and you also have many choices for gifts to buy Nice food too at the restaurants
13415,4,Insadong is a nice shopping area with a lot of small shops Particularly a lot of local designer Tshirts accessories bags etc could be found there The price is a bit expensive since their target customers are tourists Some restaurants are there as well Worthwhile a visit to spend around 23 hours
13416,4,There are all the tourist traps here but it is still a nice place to visit do some shopping eat and just stroll
13417,4,Having lived in the Seoul area for almost a year I still believe that Insa is a great place to go even though it can be touristy There is plenty to see do eat and buy especially gifts for friends when you visit home or send to during the holiday time Theres a great dumpling place a little off the main street Look for the line Also its a nottoofarawaynice walk to the Hanok village
13418,5,I could possibly have spent a week poking through all the shops there Also worth checking out  the Live Museum
13419,5,What a fun assault on all the senses Take your time go in the late afternoon early evening and make sure you stop at Tapgol Park on the southern end of the district
13420,5,Loved this area of Seoul Beautiful decorations surrounding the temple while I was there and local dances Great shops and restaurants in the area
13421,1,If you need a quick 2 hours to buy all your souvenirs this is the place to be one street with a few side lanes Does my head in though crowded
13422,5,This place has every souvenir item you could think of Though there are a lot of tourists here Insadong has a lot to offer so you wont feel bored
13423,4,Great atmosphere relaxing with at galleries good food nice shopping Love it One of my favourite 
13424,5,We loved Insadong Within 3 hours we were able to see some of the local food being sold on the street get funny socks for gifts business holders for our office an iphone case for a friend with Kia Tigers on it go to a Tea Museum and try wonderful tea have some of the best dumplings and cold soup I have ever had have a beer on the 3rd floor and people watch and have fried dough curved and holding ice cream I am not sure if you could do this anywhere else in the world in such a small amount of space It is a must seedo while you are in Seoul and can be great for all ages
13425,3,I visited Insadong in 2008 2012 and 2014 Each year the number of tourists here just increases The tea houses tucked in the back alleys are nice and quaint but to navigate through the tourists to get to these are no longer that great a trip But of course if you have not visited Insadong before still worth a trip
13426,5,This was one of my favorite places in Seoul The area is filled with local artisans not cheap stuff I bought my souvenirs here and went back at least twice more The area was very clean with a very upbeat atmosphere The main street had a slightly more European flair than the other shopping areas so I enjoyed very much The small side streets looked like they had amazing food although I couldnt eat the deliciouslooking dumplings and such because I do not eat beef or pork All the restaurants looked good clean and safe to eat My absolute favorite tea shop was here called Osulloc Make sure you visit if you love tea Simply amazing
13427,5,Fun place to visit for a nice walk and shopping for souvenirs like phone charms key chains masks clothing etc very crowded on weekends but fun due to all the activity We had good ice cream in interesting ice cream cones Also had delicious fried dough filled with honey cinnamon and sesame seeds; also had delicious fried small cakes filled with bean paste and nice grilled chicken on a stick It is a busy area but easy to get to by taxi Highly recommend you can walk to other areas in Seoul from here too
13428,4,An area for those that enjoy traditional culture and arts There is a great atmosphere and feel about the area  many of the signs of restaurants even Western ones are in Hangeul Youll find many food options and outdoor stalls selling snacks Definitely do as the locals do and try some out Grab some souvenirs and antiques while you are there
13429,5,Great place to walk around and buy souvenirs also good street food Bring comfy shoes and you can walk nearby to the palace
13430,5,The street was very artistic full of historical moments  We managed to see a monk drawing something on a long cloth  There were lots of arts and crafts selling we managed to make our own chop stamp
13431,3,The best place is Ssamziegil where traditional art is reinterpreted in the modern way Its nice to browse around Go to the side streets for the restaurants There are cosmetic and teacoffee shops but not as crazy as Myeongdong
13432,5,If you like small shops featuring local art and local historical style restaurants this is a great spot for a wander Quite a contrast to the modern mega shopping areas of Seoul which are impressive in size and variety too but this is where you go for local and historical items and personal service
13433,5,Such a nice area I came back many evenings to stroll and dine Lots of restaurants to choose from gorgeous tea houses in traditional style and plenty of places to have a few quiet drinks overlooking the street Nice little shops along the way most a little different to what you will find in the Hypermalls Only a short walk to the Royal Palace
13434,4,The souvenirs on sale here were beautiful  reasonably priced too Nice place to hang out for a short time
13435,4,Great fun Really touristy of course But one of the few places you can hit every possible hand craft shopping and lots of food options We ducked back into several tiny Bulgogi shops as well as some Nice tea Shops look for the one that has a Tea Museum in it probably my favorite  its down a little alley way near the recycle Center Tons to do see and buy Schedule 45 hours here if you really want to enjoy the arts and crafts Also there are hands on opportunities in the basement of the big mall building artist co op
13436,4,If you want to get away from all the high rise buildings and streets crowded with traffic Insadong is a good place to go Very friendly atmosphere nice galleries small shop and such Worth a stroll especially when the weather is nice Can be crowded though keep that in mind
13437,4,Insadong is 1 of my favourite spots in Seoul its very easy to walk around plenty of sightseeing stuff  do not give Ssamziegil a miss u will love it
13438,3,Rather touristy and pricey items for sale here Though still a good place to take a stroll for a visit Samssiegil has a range of eclectic shops for those keen to obtain unique items
13439,4,Please try the big J shape biscuit with ice cream U can get ur souvenir from here 23hrs to spend here is enough Advice to check the expiry date of product if you buying cosmeticskin care product
13440,5,As to what the bus info said it is what it is it is a great place to walk around in day or night also os shopping hand made crafts to fashion and also subway stations it really describes what south korea is about
13441,4,We thought the place was a bit of a cliche but we still bought most of our souvenirs here Its a long alley of trinkets restaurants art shops etc Everyone should go at least once
13442,4,Artsy but so much more on this street Best dumplings freshly made at this place midway up the street on the left in an alley At lunch time can be easily identified by the long lineup of patrons Try the dumpings combo and the fried dumplings So many unique foodsdesserts to try People walking with unique shaped long cones of icecream Worth a visit or two
13443,4,We visited Insadong twice during our 5 day stay in Seoul We loved the look and feel of the area and enjoyed the restaurants and shops If you are a fan of teas I would highly recommend visiting this area The countless tea cafes and tea shops are very lovely If you are traveling with a small child I recommend carrying them or having them walk rather than using a strollerpram A lot of restaurants require walking up a set of stairs Also the crowds would have made it difficult to push around our 7 month old daughter in her stroller but we fortunately had our baby carrier There are also a lot of English speaking tourist information reps that helped to point us in the right direction
13444,4,This place is near Gyeongbukgong palace and Hanok village You may visit since this is very near the other tourist attractions There are a lot of tourists around the area also There are also a lot of artsy stuff for sale if you are into that kind of things There are also street food on every corner for you to try
13445,5,First time for us in Insadong its a very uniqe place A lot of traditional restaurant around here Cute gift shop cute small groceries relaxing place to shop around very nice
13446,4,While there is a fare share of tourist trash trinkets there are also a few hidden gems of the main drag with true one of a kind arts and crafts
13447,4,Most of the people surrounding you here will be tourists but its still an entertaining district Peek in the shops and have some street food
13448,4,We came here for the last 2 hours of our trip before going to the airport  Great atmosphere on a Sunday morning Some street performances A lot of tourist souvenir shops cheaper than Myeung dong Very relax atmosphere for you to wonder around Ate some snack food hereyes the ice cream on the tube cone was quite a highlightpractically every tourist was spotted with one However only the locals were buying the more traditional snacks So if you are here do walk into the alleys to try the traditional stuff Went into a tea shop and had a refreshing time tasting and buying the tea  Will most likely visit again  this time to explore the nooks and alleys Good place to spend an afternoon
13449,4,We had fun walking around this area and seeing some interesting shops had a great authentic meal at one of the many restaurants
13450,4,I really enjoyed wandering around Insadong one evening There are crowds of people and there are numerous shops with so many crafts A really great area even if youre just window shopping
13451,4,I was looking for a specific painting and directed by my hotel to take the trip to Insadong Glad I did The artist was located inside the subway and had just what I wanted Only here can you find those unique cheap souvenir items without the hassle of other places If you are in Seoul take the Metro rail or a cab Lots of strolling on the narrow alley of bargains and grab a bite while there
13452,4,Insadong has become commercialized but still represents a pleasant neighborhood in Seoul to visit stroll around in and peoplewatch Pedestrianonly paths are lined with artists studios art supply stores eateries and handicraft  souvenir stores
13453,5,Excellent place for tourist to understand S KOREA
13454,3,There is nothing special about this place The shops are mostly selling souvenirs Nothing more
13455,4,Enjoy walking and checkin out the art work at ssamziegil mall insadong Saw some snow flakes there too REmember to try out the Poop cake located at G floor it was nice 
13456,4,My time in Seoul is really short but Insadong is really my favourite I spent most of my time here  Its a paradise for people who likes arts Art works decorations exhibitions etc Things are definitely not cheap but theyre all so pretty  Ive got a pair of glasses made in half an hour in Ssamziegil too in a shop called Eye Sonagi Even with problems communicating properly I appreciate how much the shop tried and provided good service  If I were to go back to Seoul again I would will go Insadong
13457,3,My husband admittedly not a shopper and I roamed this crowded street for all of about 35 minutes so you know we didnt get too far It was a Friday but it was jammed particularly with young gals looking for typical tourist souvenirs  there are many such shops but all too crowded to enter or to move around it We did happen into a lovely jewelry shop studio and also into a very upscale local clothing designers small shop We made it down a couple of the quaint alleyways but found nothing more of interest and my husband was not amused We spotted a number of welcoming teacoffee shops but we had recently eaten and were not anxious to stop for a cup so we departed I the shopped was not disappointed to depart; had I been alone I would have wandered another hour or so just so I would have felt my initial impressions were valid
13458,5,I simply love Insadong Ive been to Insadong 6 times in my 4 visits to Seoul The only place i would buy traditional souvenirs and handicrafts I once tried getting traditional souvenirs from other places like Dongdameon Itaewon Myeongdong Gangnam underground shopping area but Insadong has so many variety and colors for you to choose  from small teddy bear wearing Hanbok keychain to cosmetic pouches to tea set to art pieces The other places i mentioned here may have one or two types of souvenirs with limited colors  usually same price or slighly higher price than Insadong At Insadong do not buy from the first shop you see the item you are interested to buy Walk around first Many shops sell similar things Shops at the main alley seems to sell at standard price Look for the items at the small alleys I got cheaper price at these shops If you need to buy lots of souvenirs for people back home walk around mentally think of things you want to buy and buy from one shop They will give you better price if you buy a lot  I always enjoy the street performances at Insadong Stay and watch and immersed yourself in the relax atmosphere And there is Ssamziegil  a unique shopping building with spiral stairsway But prices at Ssamziegil are generally more expensive than the mainsmall alleys
13459,3,This is an alley with many old tradition houses and these houses are mostly restaurants Restaurants here are quite costly We enjoy the walk but went somewhere else for dining
13460,4,It is quite interesting to see so many people in just one street I also find the shops interesting selling trinkets souvenirs and food We tried the food sold in the sidewalk Artists are also found here
13461,4,The multistorey shopping atrium in a side street is probably the best place to visit Loud with teenagers you can nevertheless find a lot of cool things to buy new and old There is plenty of food around also
13462,3,It was neat to walk through There were neat socks there are neat socks every 20 meters in Seoul Good to see but the majority of your time is better spent elsewhere
13463,4,I have been to this place sereval times and i love going back to dis placeMostly its shopping place for the foreigners so you should haggle before buying anythingYou will get all kinds of traditional items souvenirs  handmade things as well as paintings Subway is the best option to go there Jonggak Station Exit 3 Anguk Station Exit 5
13464,4,art crafts arts gallery etc etc everything about art is here Nice atmosphere Do check it out when you are in Seoul
13465,5,Are you KPOP LOVERS  They have KPOP STORESBut the very recommended one is ill give you the direction Starts from the outside of mall Mesa just go straight to the market until you see the 2 branches street take the right one the just go straight pass the face shop and go straight you can see the store on your left side right infront of missha store
13466,5,The hundreds of booths with variety of goods makes this the best shopping area we saw The vast majority of craft is made in Korea and is very reasonably priced Many vendors will also negotiate the price It is a treasure trove of culture
13467,3,Nice to see if you can catch it on a quiet day but generally the shops are expensive and aimed at selling at opportunist prices to the bus loads of tourists charging through
13468,4,Its a nice area to peruse but its definitely aimed at tourists lines of tourist buses are parked and ready to unload Japanese and Chinese groups at all times Towards the end of the main street there is a great little craft mall that spirals up 3 or 4 floors Inside you will find slightly more expensive but much more unique and interesting items for sale Its all very artistic and the street food available in this area is decent as well Still there are better neighbourhoods to visit if you want a more local experience
13469,4,Many resto and fancy stores Mostly they sell antique materials and instruments You can try the dessert white pastry they handmade it Cafes and lots of small bakery shops You can visit the tea store famous jejune green tea shop
13470,4,Insadong had a lot of arts and crafts One great building about the middle of the market that is 6 stories of nothing but small hand made craft items Of course the prerequisite tourist swag Shirts nicnacs etc The main attraction is the market is very close to the subway exit Some of the pricing is better if you venture over to Myeongdong for similar items though After walking around I highly recommend the foot massage for 18000KWon 1650USD for 30 minutes There is a rotating foot in the alley about midway It was wonderful I really needed it after all the walking around in Seoul If you want they do have the little fish that eat the dead skin off your feet I hear it is also great but not for me
13471,4,Like other reviewers said somewhat touristy But it has interesting galleries shops very vibrant at night Dont go in the morning nothing is open For a one stop souvenir shopping it is a great place Not to mention it is very close to the two palaces and subway station
13472,5,One of the Seouls most visited places among foreign travelers Insadong is often regarded as a museum in which modern and tradition coexist in a harmonious manner The district contains historical sites and its roads and alleys are lined with traditional tea houses restaurants calligraphy shops antique shops art galleries and craft workshops Its main road turns into a pedestrian zone every Saturday afternoon and Sunday offering a venue for exciting street performances including traditional folk performances
13473,3,Filled with 1 souvenir shops 2 arts and crafts 3 small cafes and street snacks  Be willing to haggle and if the price is not right move on and compare
13474,4,Easily accessible via subway with great bargains and variety of souvenirs art works etc Prices are comparatively cheaper here too
13475,4,The mustdo for first time tourists in Seoul I guess I enjoyed walking along the street looking at what was on offer and soaking in the buzz and crowd But at the end of the day not much different from other shopping areas in Seoul
13476,3,This could have been a quaint little village with artsy shops and nice restaurants in traditional set upif not for the crowd I was unfortunately there on a weekend The crowd starts from the traffic junction where you see so many people trying to cross over to Insadong The wierd thing is the place was not fancy or brightly lit and with so many people walking around it was somewhat uncomfortable and I cannot wait to get out of the place
13477,4,This is the perfect place to pick up some souvenirstraditional gifts for your friends and loved ones And enjoy some tasty snacks while you are at it This is a walking street surrounded by shops In the nearby alleys there are a number of Buddhist institutions If you want a good traditional meal try the Barugongyang restaurant within the Temple stay building in front of jogyesa temple
13478,5,Ive been to Insadong many times It is always lively with great entertainment along the streets Insadong is great for trying traditional foods of Korea and buying traditional souvenir known to Korea This place is a must if one is visiting Korea You can get a real feel of the culture here
13479,3,nothing much here there are quite a number of stall selling souvenirs and its abit pricey but what worth to buy in korea i think probably their stainless steel utensils
13480,4,Street vendors selling everything and different types of food and drink for sale in this nice area of Seoul There are also many tea houses Fun to visit Dont forget to buy the Taffy TTeokduk
13481,4,Great place to walk around enjoy a tea visit art galleries and take it all in Shop keepers and artists were all very friendly If looking to take home a souvenir make sure it is certified as made in Korea Lots of cute restaurants
13482,3,Everybody says its a must go when youre travelling in Seoul I tend to disagree Ok you will see a lot of traditional souvenirs and it might look interesting but most of them are traditional stuff made in China It can easilly getting quite expensive as well Prefer traditional markets Gwangjang or Dongdaemun for exemple  Although Insadong might be more Englishfriendly
13483,5,Shopping food history Its all here Outdoor mall Alleys full of food sights shops and attractions
13484,5,Insadong is a quaint place with lots of narrow alleys and streets and is filled with people during weekends I guess they were there to either eat or shop The place has some awesome restaurants tea houses galleries and shops We dined at Sanchon a pricey but authentic temple food restaurant I did quite a bit of shopping too and found the products to be extremely good quality compared to other open markets in Seoul Insadong is very close to the Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Bukchon Village and so you can do all three of them in half a day
13485,2,I had imagined a bigger street with many different shops and souvenirs but after 3 all looked the same
13486,4,We were limited by time but had a great visit to Insadong While we were there a traditional band marched down the street It was a great show we will revisit Insadong on a day when we have more time
13487,4,over here u can walk into the alley to eat authentic Korea food and there is a tea shop that brew really nice fruit and flower tea
13488,4,Visited one Saturday midmorning and the place was just bustling Very touristy but much of the local culture was on show The tea houses were great and the street food a ttreat lots of restaurants to chhose from too Seem to be quite a long street so wear comfortable shoes There was a street parade at the time of my visit and that really got everyone visitors and locals transfixed for a while  Lots of souvenirs shops but was dissapointed that not much variety to choose from The prices werent that great either I got better bargains and more variety elsewhere Good place for costume jewelry  Just walking up and down the street though you could feel the pulse of the people A nice way to spend half a day and catch the real sights and sounds of Seoul
13489,5,I really loved shopping for little bits and bobs here Really col atmosphere and some great art galleries around to You can buy cute souvenirs here
13490,5,This wasnt only my favorite area because we were staying at the Fraser Suites but there was so much to see and do If youre not staying in the area be sure to take a look
13491,4,This place is about 4 blocks long full of touristy and artsy shops There was a multifloor plaza Ssamziegil located right on the main road that we found really interesting  full of unique oneofakind type stores Lots of souvenir stores as well Great way to spend an hour or 2
13492,5,Insadong is a great place to find souvenirs especially for people who cant stand Itaewon Theres an antiques street lots of street food and performers and a place to get fresh dragons beard candy A great place to spend an afternoon especially after visiting Changdeokgung palace
13493,4,Insadong is a interesting place with local culture handicrafts collectible art and food this place is always clouded event in the week days  we were there during week days and the place is full of people not only tourist but local as well there are also a lot of students having survey programs its a great place to visit  you can find the famous corn ice cream at this place the shop is a corner shop you cant miss it coz youll see a long queue till the road side   along the road is also alot of local tea and desert shop you must stop and try it
13494,5,Just be prepared for pushy salespeople The area is gorgeous the streets are very pedestrian friendly and theres lots to see
13495,3,Compare to Myeongdong Insadong is not as crowded but there are some unique traditional itmes you can buy Also many eateries you can try The foods are very cheap; between 6 to 10 you can have hearty meals
13496,4,Place to be if youre looking for souvenir items such as tshirts key chains posters etc Theres a lot to choose from and this will be the best place to find cheap souvenir items compared to souvenir items youll find in malls and duty free shops The place is neat with lots of cool street arts and designs Bargain item prices Found that the lowest items i bought has the following ranges Korea Tshirts  5KRW Magnets  23KRW Scarfs  310KRW  We had trouble finding the Money Exchange Stalls as other locals point us to the local banks which charges commission rates but eventually found them inside souvenir stores so better keep your eyes open
13497,3,If you want to bring back the gifts this is the placethe price and quality is goodquite a number of good cafe to quench your thirst and to rest your feet after strolling along the roadpersonally  my favourate place to go
13498,5,We stayed at Angouk just around the corner so walked here some evenings The shops are great for high quality gifts We loved the pottery and the individual craft shops  We also ate in the restaurants that offer really great food at reasonable prices  I would def stay in this area again
13499,2,I dont really see the attraction to this area Could be great for people watching but thats about it Tacky souvenirs and same old street food Nothing special if you have been anywhere in Asia
13500,4,Insadong used to be a place to go for traditional craft but I think most of the shops have now are selling souviners which is nice too as the souviners here tend to be of better quality There is also arts  craft mall which sells nice handicraft As with most trendy places in Seoul there are also many nice cafes to visit
13501,5,Cheap stuff with perfect quality u can find in insadong Traditional things also  I like it  u have 2 visit  its worth
13502,5,This is one of my favorite places in Seoul There are tons of art galleries and supplies on this street Its a fun little shopping street where you can buy lots of gifts from Korea Reasonably priced Also you can bargain with the shopkeepers here and near lots of dining options Good way to spend an hour or two
13503,5,Insadong is alive with shops restaurants and vendors Neighbouring Palaces provide an experience second to none The clothing stores are unique their goods mostly hand made and one of a kind Amber stones beautifully set in unique designs are available Silk handmade fans and scarves are readily available for sale Insadong is a vibrant area and must be added to the travellers list of things to do while in Seoul
13504,5,You will be greeted with a nice street that has art galleries  cafes Samzegil is further down the road  its a nice little mall with interesting shops Plenty of photo taking opportunity
13505,5,Great place to hang out Korea is very traditional at heart despite all the media hype and here at Insadong tradition meets modern life which is perfect for tourists
13506,3,The area is full of various smells sights and sounds It really has a mix of everything and is a far cry from the Gangham district It has many shops selling all and sundry tchotchkes foodstuff and some knockoff items It is very large and one can really take a good stroll I did purchase a tshirt for 5 which is really inexpensive for Seoul I really recommend wearing flat shoes as my friend had some difficulty navigating some of the laneways
13507,4,If you are shopping around Insadong you should visit Ms Lee Cafe Ms Lee Cafe was featured by Sweet Potato Couple from We Got Married Their special menu will be old school bibimbap at 6000won and is really cool Very retro and unique hardly you can find it in any other restaurant  Read more at my blog; httploveanqilablogspotsg201309traveloguemissleecafeatinsadonghtml
13508,4,Really like this street  have shopped there before and returned on this trip Lots of great shops and food along the street  even better on the side streets Some small hotels  not sure if they are good but wow location if you did stay in one Bargaining is fine here but more like 20 or so off and not 50 off or anything that aggressive Still good to see some price cuts
13509,4,Went to Insadong St on our first night in Seoul  it was a good experience Plenty of Tourist shops  also plenty of food There where alot of people about  the whole atmosphere was of fun  relaxation It is right next door to Tapgol Park  a very short walk from Jongo 3ga stop on line 1 of the subwayIt seemed to be a pedestrian only street at night SO just be a bit careful during the dayIf you go to Insadong ST you have to try the ice creamwaffle combination from a shop there It has a long U shaped piece hollow piece of wafle that is filled with soft serve ice cream Cool as  a niece treat
13510,5,A street enriched with most essential items for art painting but has also extended to souvenirs for tourists Yet it is not overwhelmed by foreign tourists where prices for souvenirs are generally cheaper than other areas like Itawon Myongdong and Namdaemun Market
13511,5,It is an almost 2 km long street filled with art galleries and souvenir shops Definitely to see You can find amazing posters prints and artwork in the galleries Also this street is 1 place to go for souvenirs of Seoul and Korea
13512,4,This is a nice pedestrian only street where you can find almost anything from clothing food and souvenirs The price is affordable though not cheap
13513,3,A street with many alleys line with teahouse restaurant sourvenir shops art shops etc  Probably is not my area of interests hence I rated an average Also we visited on a raining day so did not really see much except people hiding from the rain and many umbrellas
13514,5,Insandong is a wonderful place to spend meandering among the many shops eateries and hawker stalls It has a bit of a carnival atmosphere in the evening You can buy everything from typical souvenirs to beautiful handtailored clothing Well worth a visit
13515,4,Its well worth finding time in the evening to have a wander around Insadong  an interesting collection of shops selling local products and eating places Amongst the high rise and neon of central Seoul you get to experience a different side of the city amongst the narrow streets here
13516,3,This was my fourth trip to Insadong in the last five years I had anticipated the visit all week and saved an afternoon to wander the stores I was very disappointed at the increase in plastic souvenir items on vendor carts and in stores It was hard to focus on what had been the interesting traditional items
13517,5,great souvenir shopping and great sightseeing and super duper nice peoplehere you can see modern people live in ancient sceneryperfectthey are so beautiful tooyou must go here if you visiting seoul just buy souvenir at here go to the palace first then take a cab to shopping area i think the taxi is only 4000 or 3000 won onlyenjoy
13518,4,went to buy souvenirsthere are many shops selling souvenirs along the roadfind good bargain shops sometimes we can get 10 discount on the items we buy at certain amounti spent about won 180 000 to buy long spoons for my friends n relatives fridge magnets key chains and many other souvenirs made in korea you have to walk until the end of the road to see what they have in insadongpls see the photos and then you can understand why one have to put insadong in his itenerary in seouli really enjoyed it
13519,5,Excellent place to enjoy the tradition Food might be a little pricey but the area is totally awesome Also i stayed at Insa Hostel only 100m away from this lovely street There is street performance every night and it is not as busy as other area 
13520,4,Insadong is a upper scale neighborhood of coffee shops restaurants and merchant shops If you have some time in the afternoon just walking through the mostly automobilefree streets is a real treat
13521,4,good spot for shopping and they all take credit cards Many restaurants for that quick bite Prices appear to be fixed but with some haggling they will reduce the price a few Won
13522,5,I love to walk along Insadong It has a relax feel and you can find some unique shops selling stuffs made by the owner There are also many cafes and its a good way to rest have a cup of coffe and watch the crowd
13523,4,Great for a few hours of tourist shopping and enjoying a tea Most of the stuff for sale seems to be slightly more expensive than other places around the city but all available in one spot with great choice
13524,5,One of the best shopping districts one can find Its so methodical and all shops are neatly arranged and paved roads make the entire shopping experience fun There are great bargains on shoes bags and clothes
13525,5,Great to see some local historyarts and crafts A few local storescafes within the community  One visit would be enough
13526,5,Insadong is like a place trapped in time you get a whole new feeling and experience once you enter the main street of Insadong Time and activities seem to slow down just a little for you There were many people when I went there but it never dampened or affect my experience there at all Tons of galleries shops selling traditional handicrafts instruments and paintings tea houses chic little boutique shops and quaint undiscovered restaurants which fell right into my alley I love appreciating art and antiques so I really enjoyed my time there especially when the art galleries there displayed art and held exhibitions free of charge I practically spent the whole afternoon going in and out of different galleries and admiring the archaic yet enchanting old shophouses lining the main street Very touristy area but I still loved it
13527,3,Just my opinion herearea is nice but basically one street with shops Nothing specialif time is limited you wont miss much here by not going
13528,5,This place was very crowded on a Saturday afternoon to be fair but it was filled with plenty of things to do I doubt there will ever be enough time to see everything here Lots of art museums shops and restaurants plus a ton of street vendors and good street food Plus the surrounding city area is clean and very nice to spend time in I will come here many times in the future
13529,4,Has a different feel from the streets of myeongdong and likes Enjoyed the stroll there and just seeing the shops and wares they were selling
13530,3,Hubby use to live in Seoul many moons ago and said this use to be a more authentic artists street with more handmade crafts etc Unfortunately now days its become more commercial However its still worth a stroll There are still a number of interesting shops for art and crafts Definitely check out the little side lanes off of the main Insadong Lots of restaurants and cafes as well so a good area to get something to eat It is close to Gyeongbokgung palace so it would not be hard to take a quick look if youre near by anyway
13531,4,This market has some great little cafes and restaurants so try some tea or shaved ice while you are here The antique shops on the side streets are really interesting and some of the main souvenir shops are really goodhigh quality items not necessarily cheap but very good Busy and crowded but friendly and fun to experience
13532,3,Every city has one of these touristic local or international people walking up and down shops with similar types of commodities street food and you get lots of chances to buy souvenirs Of course you need to find and dig out the little gems in between So be patient and take your time be sure to enter into the little side streets usually good stuff are in those narrow alleys
13533,5,This is a great area to walk around in If you go down some of the side alleys you can find anything from a cute cafe to an art gallery Along the main road there are also lots of souvenirs and antique stores It can be very crowded on the weekends but even then I always enjoy my time there
13534,5,Like food atmosphere art style shops cheap and unique not common things can spend more than 3 hours there Dislike none at all
13535,5,Fantastic place to purchase all your travel souveniers The souveniers here are of better quality than other places
13536,3,Its supposed to be a cultural place with art gallery However i find more shops selling souvenirs more than art gallery The dragon beard candy there is superb though 2 shops are side by side the one on the left is more popular and i usually buy from that shop
13537,3,Interesting place to walk through to look at all the novelties for sale Great places to eat drink coffee and also close to the happiness palace
13538,5,Excellent place to shop for souvenirs local arts ceramics This place is well known for the tea houses which serve tea in a traditional way Also many restaurants and antique shops in the area The souvenirs here are a bit more expansive then at the local markets but then again the choice is the widest There are many artists and performers at the street and its buzzing with culture As it is well located and reached by foot or the metro it makes it a perfect place to visit any time Also many of the historic places are around and reachable by foot so always a good idea to start and end sightseeing hereThere is an information point at which you can get any advice and local detailed maps
13539,4,Some call this street as Antique Street I dont know about that because my main intention coming here only and only to find special souvenir that cant be find elsewhere
13540,3,Great for people watching as well as checking out the wide range of merchandise on display It can get crowded and you will need to do a fair amount of walking You need to wear comfortable shoes
13541,4,This is a great place to walk around and buy some souvenirs for family and friends and its a great place to do some window shopping and talk and then the best part is to decide what kind of lunch you want to have there are small unique places off the beaten path and be a little adventurous and wander down some of the small alleys for the best little restaurants there is one that i found that was traditional vegetarian cooking only was really good even though im not a vegetarian at all i would go there again Give it a try and look all around there are some great coffee shops here too i like to go in the winter time when there are less people weekends are packed
13542,5,This is a paradise for shopping souvenirs The entire road is full of shops selling souvenirs and there are certain boutique shop as well Do bargain if you are paying by cash and in certain shops they allow 10 percent discount An excellent place to buy things
13543,4,Insadong always gives me a feeling of warmth and fuzziness The layout is simple and not as commercially invasive as compared to Myeongdong It is comforting to take a stroll down the street of Insadong without being harassed by noisy cosmetic shop girls a la Myeongdong style  A mustdo in Insadong for me is to go to Osulloc Cafe and spend an hour or two nursing a cup of hot green tea latte and green tea ice cream and green tea cake And dont forget to buy back some gorgeous green tea bags and cute mugs from the shop
13544,5,My top favourite place in Seoul The artistic feel along the street especially the Ssamgiezil The whole building is lovely Love to spend an afternoon there
13545,5,I lived in Seoul for two years and whenever I had company come to visit we made a special trip to Insadong It is great to see all the shops  you can get all souvenirs needed include the street next to Insadong street The prices are reasonable but do check out the stores next to each other The services are good Lots of really good restaurants Go earlier in the day as there is a lot less people The tourists start coming around 10 or 11 and then it can get quite busy It has a great atmosphere and has a good representation of Korea in the area
13546,1,It all looks a bit touristic trap not original flavour remains Other closeby areas are much better
13547,4,nice district very safe and pleasant to stroll along the stream But beware when rain comes side flaps open in walls along stream and shush the run off onto the path below from the road above Stream overflows and path disappears so sandals advisable
13548,5,We were shopping for awhile actually I was shopping while my husband followed me and stayed on the street He was stopped by a young school child and his mother who wanted to use him for the completion of a homework assignment that required him to answer simple questions Who is your favorite rock star My husband was wise enough to answer Psy Encounter was recorded on the moms phone Very cute Later we were approached by a group of young adults all of whom were studying English and wanted to practice speaking That was fun Ive traveled a lot and never had this happen
13549,5,I spent a lot of time in Insadong There are so many shops and cafes lots of wonder art work and creativity in this neighborhood Loved it
13550,5,Good to stroll around and buy souvenirsWatch weird shaped Ice cream conestrumpet sizedGood restaurants too around area
13551,4,This area is touted as the arts district It may very well be but a lot of the stores sell the same tourist nicknacs There are qualityunique products to be found you just need to look a little harder
13552,4,This is the place where you can find souvenirs at a bargain Lots of food and restaurants around the area Try live octopus sashimi for those who are brave at heart Otherwise have it cooked or grilled or even in steaming pot of broth
13553,4,Great place to wander around Interesting artists shops selling artworks artists materials like brushes ink stick ink stone and bolts of art paper Fascinating 
13554,1,Insadong area is loaded with shops selling local products and souvenirs We spent a morning in Ssamzingil as there was a workshop on the lower level where you can make your own souvenir like woodcarving bottle painting etc We enjoyed strolling along the alley as there were many interesting things to see Before buying though compare prices with different shops to avoid being overcharged
13555,4,We left this place until our last day and ran out of time  Yes as per other reviews lots of tourists and souvenirs but scratch the surface a little bit and there are some great little galleries tea houses and restaurants Wished wed had more time than the hour we had there
13556,5,Great place to shop for souvenirs Lots of handmade jewelry for reasonable prices There are also a few stamp stores where you can get your own name stamp Some of the store owners are willing to negotiate prices with you
13557,5,Ok there are a lot of tourists here But this is also authentic There are a number of traditional tea shops and restaurants Try the Yet Chat Jub or the old tea shop
13558,5,This is a wonderful place for souvenir shopping I did most of it here They have wonderful and unique things here I bought my mother a jade necklace It was beautiful and theyre willing to bargain
13559,5,This is a good place for souvenir shopping as there are a whole lot of shops with local handicrafts which is made in Korea and not China  Also there is Little India restaurant that serves Indian cuisine with an Indian ambience
13560,5,Its a great place to seek out conventional and unconventional souvenirs It is rather near the subway and a convenient place to get to Patrolling guides are ready to help out the lost tourist Across the street from the end are several eateries worth exploring
13561,4,This is a place mixed with cultural art and modern creativitiy I think you should go there to take a look
13562,4,There are some nice shops in the shopping mall there lots of accessories and has a tax booth for convenience Also has a nice OSulloc teahouse which you can chill out at Highly recommended
13563,3,i thought this is one of Seoul hip areas but we get here on our way to Hotel at around 10PM at night expecting to be able to grab some nice food but most restaurants were close already
13564,4,You get to see lots of souvenir stores  some nice snack shops We walked all the way back to our hotel  it only took us about 25 minutes
13565,5,I had a lot of fun walking around by myself in Insadong Lots of selection of restaurants and shops Great sightseeing destination
13566,4,We stayed at Hotel Sunbee which is very near this place Insadong is a great place to just walk around to browse for knicknacks to bring home  We also found a great little tea shop on the second floor of one of the buildings in this street  Definitely a place to visit for souvenir shopping 
13567,4,There are tons of art galleries and supplies on this street Its a fun little shopping street where you can buy lots of momentos and gifts from Korea Reasonably priced and near lots of dining options Good way to spend an hour or two
13568,2,is a neighborhood unremarkable with a lot of art galleries full of commercial art even more inconsequential ordinary restaurants and nothing special
13569,5,I went on a Friday afternoon and it wasnt even that crowded which was nice The buildings are really traditional looking which looks beautiful to me Theres lots of stores here this is not the place to shop for clothes and restaurants
13570,5,These few blocks of eclectic stores galleries craft stores restaurants cafes and tea halls While the numbers of interesting galleries and antiques stores those that actually offer antiques not just replicas has declined there is still plenty to see and experience Craft stores and small designers music and relatively authentic restaurants can be found along with stores offering affordable wares tourists may want to pick up like woodwork ceramics teas and mass produced crafts Its always fun to visit
13571,5,Love the way the designers got a place to showcase their talents Superloving Ssamziegil That place is just way too awesome and a great place to make a hole in your pocket
13572,5,museums crafts paradise also a heaven for traditional tea lovers many shops with beautiful tea sets and cups and glasses of all kinds Also craft shops and handicraft on sale Though expect slightly arty prices for the design and craftsmanship involved
13573,5,Very live place with people walking everywhere Most of them are eating or drinking something while walking with family and friends Lots of small shops to buy small things and souvenirs
13574,4,Insadong is less than a mile stretch filled with stores and street vendors It can get pretty crowded especially on the weekends but its a fun 23 hour stop You can find some pretty cheap souvenirs to take back home and dont forget to explore the side streets where most of the cafes and restaurants are at This is where we had our first silkworm experience and the taste and smell still haunt me
13575,4,lots of cool stores galleries vendor stalls and restaurants Ive also caught musical and cultural acts It gets very crowded on the weekends but its low stress since you can just walk around or sit down and people watch
13576,5,i really love this walking street you there have many coffee shop resturant and surviner also if you have a chance to walk along insadong street you would love it
13577,5,Insadong is a must see for visitors to Seoul You will see people in traditional clothes and can buy any kind of souveneir and also try some traditional snacks There are restaurants and tea shops off the main road that are worth exploring  Tip this is where you can get a picture of yourself taken in traditional clothes I did it this month for 25 Be careful  they do try to upsell you Good point is they are willing to take a few pics of your on your own phone or camera as well
13578,3,I found some good gifts here but I had to look beyond everything that was most prominent The crowds can leave you feeling less than enthused but there are some very cool things to look at Be sure to bargain and dont be afraid to walk away
13579,5,I spent half a day at insadong and it is really memorable It was snowing then and the streets are covered with snow A walk through this traditional street is good and there are lots of shops selling souvenirs for you to bring back home
13580,3,It is a long stretch of shops selling many traditional stuffsouvenirs We went there mainly to visit Ssamziegil to get some souvenirs Ssamziegil is worth a visit for unique souvenirs I realized that there were some nice restaurants with good crowd at the small alleys nearby but too bad we just had lunch elsewhere
13581,4,Insadong is a neat little stretch of road I say road but there really arent that many cars driving through Its mostly for pedestrians I noticed a lot of people call it touristy That may be the case but I didnt get that vibe  When we went through the area we ate some good food at an upstairs restaurant had delicious tea on the patio of a traditional tea house and shopped for the usual trinkets souvenirs and gifts Of course theres plenty of street food but as Ive discovered you find that all over Seoul  If there is one touristy thing its the loud and very entertaining guys making the fine strands of dough that they then use to wrap chocolate and nuts I call it horse hair Its incredible how fine they can make that stuff by hand
13582,4,Place with many shops of all kind goods starting souvenirs pottery and cosmetics There are also some really nice little restaurants to have lunch or dinner I would agree to former reviews this place is touristy but it is not bad and really worth a go
13583,3,Its full of people and touristsits very artificial If you want to buy souveneirs or people watching this is a good place other than that no need to go
13584,4,Mostly geared towards visitors shops are selling the typical kitsch that you would want to take home to your kids aunt exgirlfriends etc Most of the staffs I notice speak English to some degree and there are some nice galleries which have free admission  Food is a little expensive around here but the street food seems to be cheap and tasty The street isnt that long but if you have the legs keep walking north to Samchungdong and you will find more locals around there in a neighborhood that is a bit less touristy but still very cool
13585,5,It is always fun to walk between the small shops and art galleries There is a lot of nice stuff instead of just touristy crap that you find in so many other places
13586,5,A bit of a tourist trap but a really nice one Nothing seedy here clean busy and full of great restaurants hidden in side streets In summer there are special traditional performances for tourists and guides to help you are everywhere
13587,3,For me Insadong is just okay to walk around but I prefer to buy things in the Namdaemun Market There you can find art things and nice buildings I went there only when I had to buy the Nami Island entrance and bus ticket Also went to Ssamziegil unique shopping construction withouth elevator I hope next time can go the Jongno Tower and the Changdeukgong Place near it
13588,5,This is a good little spot for souvenir shopping  we got several small things to take home in this area There are some traditional arts as well as a much more modern art area There are also several small restaurants on the side streets This district is also between some of the temples and palaces so if you make the trip out you can also walk to some other areas Make sure to look in several different stores to see where you can get the best deal  some but not all places may negotiate There is also a shop that will dress you up in traditional outfits and take pictures there is a heavy fee for this but it looked like fun We went out to the area at least twice during our visit since it was a nice place to just walk around and poke into air conditioned shops in the summer time
13589,5,Give yourself 2 hours to stroll around insa Dong and side alleys Great galleries tea houses and cheap souvenir shops
13590,4,Nice sunday afternoon with local dance performances flea market souvineir shopping art galleries cafes et al
13591,4,A whole variety of souvenir items but what may turn tourists off is that the sales people are too illmannered Although we dont understand them very much we know that they become mean if they realize youre not buying anything and you cant even touch their stuff to check them out Theres a LOT of food totally unique of Korea it was fun trying everything out We could have stayed longer in the area if it werent for time constraint We cant help buying various souvenirs If you have more time than we did 30 minutes I suggest checking the stores first before buying because theres so much to choose from and each store offers something different you might end up buying the whole of Insadong
13592,4,I highy suggest on a gd sunny day to visit this place it has shops  food carts and lots and lots of things to see  one can just sit down and enjoy the crowd passing you by and yet still relaxing regardless or walking or just taking in some local food Great place thumbs up
13593,5,Great place to shop for souvenirs along a narrow street of museums art houses restaurants and cafes
13594,5,We found souvenirs of our trip to Korea which were well crafted Insadong had a lot of merchandise which we did not see at other street markets Art galleries were worth visiting as well as the many shops Even though it was raining so the street vendors werent there the art and antique shops were wonderful
13595,4,Love the area Its a mix of modernism and tradition Definitely must visit Ssamziegil Complex The shops sell artsy trendy and cute things Most of the shops sell accessories You can find some of them at a cheaper price in Dongdaemun though
13596,5,I probably visited Insadong 4 times during my 3 week stay in Seoul Its a bit hard to find at first but thankfully I already had friends in Seoul to give me a free tour  On our first visit we nearly ran into SHINEE if youre a kpop lover you know who Im talking about Insadong has lots of tiny shops catering to cheap tourist gifts lots of cafes galleries and a stage for live performances
13597,4,Selling wooden mask calligraphy tools hand made jewellery hand craft work pot and vase Anything one like collections just drop by Here also have some street snack for take away Artist open shops to sell their own art piece here Dont worry for food restaurant and cafe mostly on 1st floor in buildings Dont miss out the Bukchon Hanok Village nearby just 650m away Tourist information located at beginning of the street
13598,5,Insadong is a big shopping area aimed mainly towards tourists This is the area where youll find souvenirs for your friends back at home There are also lots of restaurants especially on the side streets
13599,5,awesome shopping and great cafes literally everywhere Loved the streets and ambiance A little pricey
13600,4,Insadong is a central neighborhood full of souvenir shops There you will see lots of decorative pieces made of mother of pearl specially boxes and plates There are also beautiful jewels ceramic wooden masks Prices are not low but things in general are beautiful and of good quality You can haggle to get a discount of 510 Also interesting are the stores specialized in products for oriental calligraphy that sell brushes of all sizes The area has many restaurants and snack places Most stores close at dusk Some are tax free
13601,5,A place for culture and arts lovers All the ancient narrow streets are a walk into the old Seoul  with plenty of stylish tile roofs small typical tea salon and traditional restaurants So typical
13602,5,This is the place to see traditional crafts and good shopping for memories to take home Be sure to stop into a tea shop for a break from shopping
13603,5,We loved Insadong  its a great place to walk around get a taste of Korea buy souvenirs and see many different types of galleries Its close to most of the tourist spots and if you dont have a problem walking 20 minutes its really great to add to the palaces otherwise just take the subway one stop The prices of the souvenirs are a bit high but in their defense we didnt see them cheaper anywhere else Keep in mind that even though these are real stores you can still bargain with the prices in most places
13604,4,insa dong street has line of shops they sell souvenirs paintings handicrafts scarves etc good for people who like arts and antique stuffs
13605,5,Nice art galleries with some of the most wonderful tea shops Venture through the small alley ways surprises await
13606,5,Wish I had found this nook sooner into my trip Lovely architecture great boutique shops  tea houses andif possibleless crowded than other parts of Seoul
13607,5,It is place where you can buy many interesting things from ceramic pots to jewelry Insadong street is very long and full of shops with handmade dishes clothes souvenirs etc Some shops are like museum You may try to bargain but youll get a discount only if you pay by cash
13608,5,When I lived in Seoul I would love going here for some nice tea and for little trinkets I would always bring visitors here and we would wander the greet just looking at all the little shoppes Its a cute area and such a nice relaxing treat in the middle of one of the worlds largest metropolitans
13609,3,This is my second visit to Insadong wanting to have a nice relaxing time strolling and browsing this is the place to go  Yes its touristy but not crazy busy The Main Street is filled with many shops selling trinkets souvenirs pottery and galleries  Be sure to wonder the smaller streets and be lured into many different eateries and more galleries  There werent to many food stalls as it was raining but be sure to try a shop which had some baked sweet treats its shaped like a walnut with waffle like pastry with a red bean filling a walnut centre 3000 won got me about 8 lots  There was also 2 information ambassador standing opposite Korea tourist centre there were very proactive and was on hand to help with any questions  A good place to hang out if you are looking or a few hours to kill
13610,4,cute stores many places to eat very busy especially on weekends didnt buy anything but its a nice atmosphere
13611,5,There are many markets out there but this one is the best for souvenirs I was in Seoul three times in the last year and I cant get enough of this place Great street food good restaurants You can bargain here  Yes there are various Official Tourism stores that are a little more expensive but they give you great ideas of the traditional gifts to go out to the other stores to bargain  Various temples at either end of the street and a Palace  Get the Donuts that are 2000 won Delicious  We found a place to have fish eat the dead cells of off our feet for 9000 won interesting experience They also have legit massage parlors as well
13612,5,Great shopping and a terrific temple off of insadong11 The shopping district is loaded with restaurants that have English menus
13613,3,This is a lovely place to stroll and walk around jus to have a look at old shophouses but the items sold are quite expensive compared to other places like Myeongdong
13614,5,a great collection of interesting little shops and stalls and a great atmosphere Fun to just walk around and try some of the interesting food carts
13615,4,Nice area to walk around Lots of food street vendors The stores seemed more expensive than Myeongdong Not many english speakers Streets were clean and felt safe
13616,4,everything can be found herefrom really cheap to much more exclusive and expensive artifactsPlus nice tea parlourscoffee shops and restaurants
13617,5,The main street is admittedly touristy albeit a awesome place to pick up cheap souveniors for friends and family but the galleries teahouses and shops in the many many alleys is really the place to be Also theres an incredible hotteok stall halfway down the mainstreet You cant miss it theres a queue pretty much everytime I pass the place Really lovely deep fried peanutcinnamumsugar filled doughnutty goodness
13618,4,Insadong is very famous for tourist attraction in Korea If you are visiting Korea this is good place to see Then you must go to Changduk Palace formerly Secret Garden which is one of the well kept places in Korea
13619,3,Everybody sells the same asking prices its not worth even bargaining about No antiques anywhere just fakes from China Only good thing is the street food Yum I can still smell it now
13620,5,An artsy cluttered place with fascinating little shops full of handcrafted paper and paperie calligraphy supplies furniture and antiques Many art galleries and fun cafes You may run across craftsmen making turnofthecentury pulledhoney candies a sanddrawing exhibition a yut seller clacking his bronze scissors students looking to practice their English or an impromptu performance artist
13621,4,Street food is always so interesting to watch Here they take a hard piece of white stone like made of honey and by stretching it a few THOUSAND timesin front of your eyes they turn it to almost sweet cotton in the very same way that trattorias in Italy stretch their pasta in spaghettini The area is very pleasant to walk and browse
13622,4,u want to buy traditional korea souvenirs this is the place to go  lots of shops  many restaurants cafes as well  if u r a big shopper u can easily spend 34 hrs there otherwise its a nice stroll in 1hr through the entire street with a few quick stops here and there to look around  well organized  easy to get to by subway  shops have prices that are clearly labeled wont feel like being swindled by street vendors
13623,3,most of the goods here are made in china at least they are exactly the same things you can find in any tourist district all over asia the upside was there was some traditional dancing being performed in the street which was nice
13624,4,Stumbled on this little gem did not see lots but what we did see was great This is on the NEXT time list a relaxing walk through cute shops But alas time won outbut ILL BE BACK
13625,4,I came across this area by chance but i really like it The whole area have been pedestrianised for easy strolling There were a lot shops selling variety of stuffs like souveneer clothes shoes jewelleries food and restaurant  I like one particular vegetarian restaurant where i had my lunch Unfortunately i forgot its name But it was quite deeply located from the main road Its at the end of those small lanes The food there was good and the price was reasonable For Muslim looking for food you should come here Because finding halaal food in Seoul especially in Insadong is a challenge  Insadong is difficult to enjoy in just one day especially if you like to browse the shop one by one Spare at least one whole day there Rest when you are tired Its best to enjoy when the weather is good though
13626,5,I enjoyed walking along the streets in Insadong watch the colorful signs of shops sellers of ricecake a bouquet of street food scents Very cute and cosy
13627,5,an amazing street full of traditional korea gifts and artwork I always find something new to bring back with me not to be missed
13628,5,I love Insadong for the many shops which sell an abundance of souvenirs as well as arts and craft items There are also many restaurants there and our favorite is the one which sells genuine Jeonju style bibimbab Not forgetting kkultare the traditional candy which is made on the spot by enthusiastic young men
13629,4,If you like arts then visit this area They have some lovely arts in this area You can shop for nice pottery in this area too Rice cake museum is just a few blocks from here too
13630,5,Insandong is interesting and have multiple options to buy art go to the cinema walk in the streets and just be a people watcher Use comfort shoes and enjoy the ride
13631,5,This is one of the too destinations to go to when in seoul This district is lined with art galleries and shops where you can find cultural souvenirs and interesting nick nacks There are also trendy art shops that sell vintage toys and accessories In this area you will also find a lot of interesting cafes and restaurants that make you feel youre in old korea many food stalls selling street food are also seen  do try the hotteok its a must
13632,5,This is one of the too destinations to go to when in seoul This district is lined with art galleries and shops where you can find cultural souvenirs and interesting nick nacks There are also trendy art shops that sell vintage toys and accessories In this area you will also find a lot of interesting cafes and restaurants that make you feel youre in old korea many food stalls selling street food are also seen  do try the hotteok its a must
13633,5,Great area for eating and shopping for crafts This place has lots of little streets to be explored Lots of street food and authentic restaurants
13634,5,Not the cheapest and this is not the place to look for cutting edge fashion at discounted prices but Insadong is the place to find traditional paper products clothes food arts and antiques If you are limited on time make sure to plan a few hours here It is right off a subway stop and coffee shops abound If you have more time you can go to the Namdenum or dongdemun markets and find similiar or the same products for a little less but it is highly likely the difference will only be a few cents  As is the case throughout Korea expect to find no clothing over about a size 10 womens and no shoes over a 7 or so Iaetwon would be the exception  Also note that their Large is generally not the large you get in the US While I am a large in US sizes sometimes the XXL in Korea was too small
13635,4,It is a good place to go and to fill the spirit of Seoul There are a lot of different shops restorants and small crossing streets that make this place lovely Unfortunately in most of the shops for souveniers you can find the same items but still on good price especially compared with the duty free shops at the airport So if you want to buy simething  buy it from there Also there are lovely small shops for traditionak arts  like caligrafy brushes so if you like such things this is the place Tottaly recommended
13636,4,At night the stores light large signs that give the feeling you are in Time Square It is electrifying I liked walking on the streets just looking up at the lit signs
13637,4,A Canadian expat told me about this street and I am so happy I was able to spend time browsing Its a great place to find a wide variety of local products and crafts Also I loved the narrow side streets with cafes and coffeeshops wonderful for exploring
13638,5,If you really like art that will be your favorite place many shops have really good stuff and art galleries I went 3 times there and enjoyed my time
13639,5,We enjoy exploring Insadong with ever trip to Seoul Our favorite time is round the Buddhas Birthday in May or June when celebrations at Jogyesa Temple spill out into the streets and everything is resplendent with lanterns but its a pleasure to wander and peoplewatch any time of year
13640,5,I really like how tourist friendly this place is It is one of the places in Seoul where a tourist can travel to and not worry they will be ripped off The prices in Isadong I believe are regulated The vendors are friendly helpful souvenirs are well build restaurants are generally clean and tasty A must visit for tourist plus remember to stop by a traditional tea house or restaurant for a local tea or cuisine
13641,4,Interesting street with lots of places to barter over tourist junk but also has a boutquey vibe Can also buy some nicer tourist stuff like woodblock prints etc Fun to wander up and down  we walked over after goin to the gyeongbokgung palace
13642,4,I stayed in Banana Backpackers Insadong is only a 10 minutes walking distance from Insadong If you are a man interested in Korea cultural Arts this is the place you should visit I even saw a western street musician playing violin on the street It was about 7 Oclock at night and it was cold
13643,3,Great place to take mothers wives and female children to purchase lots of traditional crafts like scarves fans tea perfumes etc Not a lot for mens
13644,4,very crowded place lots of tourist shops many local young people visit this place also But the things there are a bit expensive
13645,4,This area was good for shopping and the side streets have some very nice little places to eat or get delicious tea Unfortunately in the winter many of the shops have their wares outside so there was no way to warm up while shopping so we cut the trip short Hope to go back when this cold spell is over Dont miss the honey string vendors  cool show
13646,5,Its no wonder that this area is full of tourists because this is where youll find the best cultural crafts plus the great and affordable eating places
13647,4,Get your souvenirs here Plenty of shops to choose from and a good range of variety Lotsa of places for food too There are handicrafts and handmade accessories on sale too Need to spend a good few hours here Ssamzagil houses good restaurants and local designer craft shops which you can venture into
13648,4,I liked the fact that a touristy place like this still attracts so many locals The restaurants in the back alleys must be good Ssamzagil is a good arts and crafts centre and worth exploring
13649,4,Great place to get high quality souvenirs and eat a good meal Definitely must visit the O Sulloc Tea Shop for samples and wander down the side alley to eat at one of the restaurants Lots of art galleries can definitely spend a leisurely day wandering
13650,4,Its nice to see how mochi is being made on the street of Insadong watch some street performance and shop for souvenirs and stuff here Even bought an earthenware item that I didnt think I could find
13651,5,Dont miss Insadong for the souvenirs And dont forget to bargain for a cheaper price some will give you discount if youll buy more than one The quality of the handcraft stuffs here are really nice There are mini stalls along the sidewalk that are very intresting
13652,5,I just loved Insadong Beautiful art and crafts and there is a fantastic artoriented shopping centre as well which winds up and up to a beautiful rooftop vista It really is quite nice and restaurants everywhere Insadong is definitely a mustvisit when in Seoul
13653,4,If you are looking for small things to bring back for friend and family than this is one of the places you can come to find Lots of restaurants as well along the side alley so you got to walk into them Several shops selling tea and their accessories  There is also a couple of shopping malls rather a 45 storey high building with small shops selling several items  A good time is that it is across from the Buchon Hanook Village If you are staying there to experience the traditional Korea homes than this place is just walking distance away
13654,4,Found 3 places with good food Dumplings pork ribs  rice crackers The shopping street is really interesting with hidden art galleries
13655,3,This market was too crowded with turists and also the prices seem to be adapted mainly to Japanese turists There are some nice pottery and art shops but we found nothing that was worth buying at the price The side streets very narrow and full of restaurants are very interesting
13656,5,Dont miss this buzzing beautiful district full of boutiques arts n crafts ceramics dealers antiques shops great little restaurants and the famous tearooms  plus wonderful street traders selling exotic foods including the best sweet dumplings ever 
13657,4,This little street area is nice for a stroll there are a number of galleries heaps of shopping although most souvieners will be slightly dearer than more local markets but well worth a wonder and stop for some street snacks
13658,5,Insadong is a beautiful area to stay and where I stayed at The Fraser Suites When looking for an area and hotel to stay at including the Myeongdong Gangnam Yeouido and Itaewon areas I chose Insadong and I was very happy with this decision It is near 3 different subway lines 1 3 and 5 It borders on Jongno ro and Jongno 2 streets where there is lots of entertainment restaurants and shopping but tucked away just a block or 2 and giving you some bit of peace and quiet Insadong gil however which runs right thru this area is filled with cosmetic shops bars restaurants and shopping and vendors At night after 600 when work is finished the street comes alive with street performances and diners looking for a bite to eat Try the waffles from one of the vendors or home made honey candies Watch them make it while you wait along with many others too The Crown Bakery at the end of Insadonggil is a favorite also Tapgol Park is at the other end and a respite from the busy area The Buddhish Temple Jogyesa is just off the Insadong area also and the palaces are walking distance away Bukchon Hanok Village near by also A great place to visit eat and even a better place to stay as everything is within walking distance I will stay here again and recommend this area to others
13659,4,A little touristy but lots of friendly locals seem to also enjoy a weekend stroll in this area Lots of great restaurants to be found in the side alleys
13660,4,Nice place to visit if you are looking for souvenirs There are also baseball cages there 1000won for a few balls and you can try hitting it with the bat Fun experience
13661,4,I went on a rainy day and get a different feel of the place Its actually quite romantic to stroll in the rain along Insadong Bought souvenirs for friends and had quince tea along this small alley Its good to explore the small alleys too as they have some old looking tea shop with nice ambience Dont miss the 2nd floor of those shop houses too I found a toy museum and its pretty interesting even tho its small You can also find some busker along the street if youre lucky So rain autumn and busker on the violin makes a really romantic feel of this touristy place If you are a vintage lover you could spend half a day at least to explore this place with ease
13662,5,Stayed on the next road but walked daily on this street It has been commented that it is touristy but I loved it Everyday I found something new to see or eat
13663,4,Very touristy area in Seoul just like in Myeongdong so can get very crowded There are tons of shops everywhere and many traditional goods Even the shops name are written in Hangeul
13664,4,Insadong is the place for souvenirs shopping with the smell of oldie art on street but also some modern buildings I love how they mixed on the street Also some nice restaurants and food stalls that you must try
13665,5,Insadong is your one stop shopping street for all your souvenirs and endless interesting finds I would suggest you walk the whole strip first before making your purchases so youll have an idea what they have in store for you My favorite is Arirang Souvenir shop I would also recommend buying Kkultarae or dragon beard candy made of 16000 strands of pulled honey You can watch the vendors making them and its amazing how they come up with the strands Also in Insadong check out Ssamziegil its a building with small artsy shops selling knick knacks by local artists Be on the lookout for guides in red clothes and hat for information or map of the area if you find yourself getting lost  they can speak English
13666,5,This is where you go to get the traditional food knick knacks teas and tea pots There are plenty of shops Make sure you talk to the shop owners about tea and various items they sell that you may know recognize its a neat little strip of shopping Plus the restaurants in the area are old traditional hanoks and is a great experience for foreigners if you can sit on the floor
13667,4,My week in Seoul was so busy that I had not thought about buying gifts until the day before I was to leave This area was so varied that I was able to purchase items for all of the people on my list from my Mom to my grandchildren Be sure to have plenty of time to stroll around go into the shops and experience all of the different kinds of stores I loved looking in the shops with the myriad variety of beautiful papers and paint brushes The shops with older items was fascinating Some of the fashions were very beautiful especially the traditional clothing I ended up finding some great scarves for my Mom some great jerseys for my grandsons and some cool KPop stuff for my granddaughters There are also a wide variety of places to eat watch candy and rice cakes being made and other just all around entertainment
13668,4,Lots of small gifts shops restaurants Nice to stroll along the streets and take some photos Things ere abit pricey compare to downtown Most shops and restaurants will close after 9pm
13669,4,Its a small market street selling some food items antiques books souveniours etc They say the setting is like a traditional market of korea But in reality i dont think so It doesnt give that traditional or bound to culture feel There is also a park across the street It also not a big park and in afternoon a lot of retired people were seating there and almost no activity Anyways near the insadong street there is also a tourist info centre and subway train station so you can also get your way out and go to near by attractions
13670,5,You can spot alot of cheap souvenirs here You can even bargain if you buy more But it subjected to the seller whether they are willing to give you discount I think it will be better that you survey for the price first along the street before you make any purchase
13671,5,We visited this street every day during our visit to Seoul We bought gifts for the whole family from here The art galleries are interesting as are the shops that sell calligraphy Dont miss taking a tea break in OSulloc tea shop it is a unique place The side streets lead to antique shops and other interesting places Street carts sell different foods including silk worms which we photographed after asking for permission Overall highly recommended
13672,4,Lots of shops and stalls to spend your money on but the food carts had my attention the most I only visited the souvenir shops and the prices were reasonable so there was no need to haggle with the vendors It gets crowded here so come early if you dont like a crowd
13673,4,Apart from the souvenirs the street also has many food stands a great opportunity to try some local sweets You might also catch a live performance in one of the side streets and there might be local artists advertising their shows
13674,5,Insadong is one of the most popular areas of Seoul with tourists There are plenty of souvenirs of various types some clothes and other shopping food inc street food art and probably the best area of Seoul for buying gifts to take back home Insadong isnt one of the neon lit areas of Seoul it has more heart and character I recommend anyone going to Seoul to take a walk in Insadong
13675,5,Ive been to South Korea twice and never failed to go to this street It has everything a tourist is looking for while traveling to Korea from souvenirs bags T shirts and many other things since theres a mall alongside the street You can go to the roof top and there are many art works placed on the roof top The street is very clean and the people there are also friendly If youre lucky you might get the chance to see art exhibitions along the way if any
13676,4,It was a small shopping street with old stores beauty stores and antiques It was a great way to spend a lazy afternoon but still get to see a lot of what Seoul has to offer
13677,4,Great place to shop with some better handicrafts and artisan shops than other places in Seoul I bought some nice necklaces for my wife and daughters
13678,5,Insadong is the perfect place to wander the streets are pedestrian only theres always something going on in the parks on either end and the shops just call out for exploration You can shop for just about anything; clothes antiques souvenirs tea celadon pottery lithographs and fine art The restaurants are excellent and so is the street food
13679,4,really liked the food streets tucked into the corners of this streetoverall a very good shopping experience
13680,4,Picked up some lovely momentums of Korea here and you can bargain with the traders on what price you wish to pay If they dont wish to bargain with you they will say Had a very short visit here as on business but would have loved to have stayed longer as there are endless little shops stalls and alleys to explore
13681,4,A place to source for old korea from vendors peddling old wares from forgotten era Look out for specialty shops offering unique antiques
13682,3,Insadong is a walking street full of souvenir shops The walk was fine and there were fun stuff around it  we saw a street performance that was fun
13683,4,Area with lots to see Shops were different and interesting Great atmosphere Ideal for a leisurely stroll
13684,5,great to look for gifts lots of small gift shops price are reasonable lots of little food snacks and restaurants along the street
13685,4,This is a place you can go to snoop around in shops for actual real things cultural or trinkets to give your friends Not expensive but sometimes a little cheesy For the most part well worth the visit
13686,5,Insadong has a little bit of everything Fine art painting wood fabric pottery handmade items of all kinds touristy souvenirs so you can buy gifts for a wide variety of tastes Also great food and a moving exhibit on North Korea All in one shopping district
13687,4,When we came to Insadong we didnt think wed be going shopping But this place had a lot of shops that sell souvenirs and trinkets and the sort From street food to clothes to art pieces Interesting to see alot of tourists going around and locals selling and shopping There is also a very good restaurant in the basement of Insa Art Gallery
13688,4,To me Insadong  though a bit touristy  is one of the best places to visit in Seoul a city that is somewhat attractionchallenged It is a very artsy place with wonderful art galleries nice cafes and quaint artists There are also decent restaurants in Insadong as well as in the vicinity Visit on Sundays when the streets are strictly pedestrianonly
13689,5,Okay maybe I was being a little vague on that but this is probably a huge tourist area selling almost every souvenir you can think of Though the pottery and art is worth a look
13690,4,It serves varieties of choices from arts paintings shopping areas good mixture of cuisines Popular among tourists
13691,5,We stayed at the nearby Cats Hotel to be in the Insadong area with its temples parks palaces and the most unbelievable collection of alley ways and warrens filled with shops and restaurants of all types We even had the good fortune to witness some sort of public demonstration that according to the tourist center had something to do with architecture It would take days to explore this place and we ate numerous meals and shopped there too Its reputation as a fun and interesting place is well deserved At night it only gets busier so the action is nearly around the clock
13692,4,After 11am where shopping strip closed off to trafficThey sell things that is designed by their local designer Some of the items sold are even limited quantity
13693,4,Enjoyed watching the people and seeing the different products for sale many of the stores have very similar products so it is worth shopping around a little to get the best prices
13694,4,I spent 2 weeks staying in various areas in Seoul and only a couple of hours in Insadong I did not stay close and mostly went there on one day for a particular restaurant it is probably a tourist magnet but handles it very well with that mix of art and craft and small shops and restaurants and not too much tourist tack go to Itaewon for that Not really a destination as such for me anyway but quite pleasant for a general wander and a mix of sights and sounds
13695,4,Another place where you can get anything you want in one area Fashion food and entertainment in one place
13696,3,We went in a restaurant at one of the small streets off the main one quite expensive but big portions Theres alot of tea houses went in O sulloc coz of guidebooks recommendations The teas n desserts at the 2nd floor were nice but pricey Expensive specialised shops selling handmade crafts along the streets Theres a Road Street Bar takeout cocktail at the end which is worth a try too The drinks come in transparent packets with a straw Alcohol content wasnt high and taste quite nice Cute young bartender guy too 
13697,4,Come for the shopping the snacks and the food The souvenirs are gaudy and not appealing at all but there are hidden antique shops with gorgeous but pricey items The food options are affordable and tasty Come check this tourist strip out
13698,4,It has them all in one place This is the place to get souvenirs It is much cheaper than the same items being sold in the museum gift shops It carries all the latest and cutest fashion items to tea shops with teawares Lots of galleries and small studio for the young artists
13699,4,great place to eat and shop for souvenirs the area is not so big make sure you go into the small alleys there many beautiful small restaurants hidden there
13700,4,Insadong is a lovely area full of arts gallery studios traditional tea houses and restaurants and numerous souvenir shops I enjoyed the traditional street foods there Things are more expensive here Better price for similar souvenir in Namdaemun market
13701,4,Insadong is an Artist havenquite a number studios and exhibits in the area One of a kind handmade unique jewelry pieces can also be found here Stores are very foreigner friendly Asking for discounts is quite common and more often stores will bargain with you Restaurants also flourish the area mostly found on the side streets A small park were senior citizens gather can also be visited
13702,4,This might be one of the more interesting places to explore in Seoul as a tourist We came here with a friend of mine who is an academic at one of the local universities His English is very good so we had a readily available tour guide This was helpful but not essential if you have no such person upon whom to call We found the shops to be varied and interesting and there are several good restaurants from which to choose if you want a bite The atmosphere is a little different from other parts of Seoul as this area has a bit cozier and more retro feel It is worth taking some time to explore if you are in Seoul with some leisure time available
13703,4,This is the place to buy your gifts for family and friends One of my favourite shops was a pottery store It was filled with delicate tea pots bowls cups and candle holders Dont be afraid to bargain at some of the smaller stores There are also a great variety of food places down the ally ways off the main street
13704,4,Cool place where you can find both traditional and contemporary stuff
13705,3,Lovely spot for a stroll with lots of souvenir shops restaurants etc as well as arts and crafts places Probably a bit overpriced but pleasant nonetheless Easily accessible by subway and also by the Seoul City Tour Bus hop on hop off Stroll up and down the side streets not just the main street
13706,5,I love to see different cultures and cuisine Insadong is full of both I tried some very odd dishes and delicaciesall of which got a big tick of approval from me Insadong is full of people very busy loads of shops little cafes and alleyways where you can easily get lost as the distraction of weird and wonderful things in the shop windows get your attention I liked Insadong and in my 2 day stop over in Seoul I came here twice to take it all in
13707,3,Its a tourist and artist street Even the traditional cookie makers and ice cream vendors perform Once you resign yourself to that let loose and enjoy the shopping Some places were overpriced and off on side streets one could get better prices and find more interesting artists for which I did not mind paying more for The work was incredible Food was priced ridiculously high I recommend shopping and then going somewhere else to eat
13708,5,Loved the variety of color the many goods available the throngs of people We went to a great tea house there too
13709,4,In this street youll find a lot of souvenir stores and tea and great tea stores Most of the souvenir stores sell the same stuff but Im shure youll find the perfect one
13710,5,This a very nice area lined with small shops for souvenirs coffee shops and some nice restaurants Five minute walk from a metro station Strangely enough I did not see many currency exchange shops or banks around the area so change before you go there if necessary
13711,5,There are so many interesting tea houses and shops in this area that I went back a second time during my 4 days in Seoul As an artist I was particularly attracted to the paper goods and pottery
13712,5,Wowshoppers and bargain hunters this is paradise An absolutely breathtaking area we thought and happened to be staying just around the corner Endless shops selling everything you could imagine from the lower priced touristy stuff to the upper end of high fashion gorgeous clothes shoes jewellery leather work Beautiful linen clothing Restaurants everywhere with unreal cheap food and little tea houses tucked away up alley ways  they were awesome and the variety of teas Loved this area and hardly strayed from it Definitely going back
13713,4,I loved the fusion restaurant in old house with garden and the tea place with gallery nearby too
13714,5,What a lovely artsy district I got engaged in an amazing Italian restaurant hidden in one of the alleys Last time I was here was in 2008 but I am sure it is still definitely worth a visit Take time to get a portrait sketched by one of the artists
13715,4,Insa dong is a great place to shop and eat ice creams  the place is full with locals and tourists and there are a lot of things to see there culturally
13716,4,We walked up to Insadong easy walk and safe We liked the area and were impressed with the fact that we werent pestered to buy stuff It is touristy in a not so overt way Need to visit at least once
13717,4,I didnt get to spend much time here but there are lots of interesting things to do and great food Ill be back
13718,3,Insadong is famed for being an area full of art galleries and shops that sell antiques and Buddhist items If you are into such stuff look no more Also if you really spend some time here you might find interesting shops that sells unique handicraft that make good souvenirs  Personally Im not an arts buff so Insadong wasnt appealing to me Still an interesting place to visit nonetheless There are lots of tourists here  One stall of interest would be the taffy snack stall A bunch of guys would say really funny stuff while they transform a slab of honey into hairlike strands that are used to wrap various fillings Even if you might not like the snack initially you will succumb to buying one after the performance  Not cheap though I bought 4 boxes for 20000 won and each box contained only 10 taffy
13719,5,Insadong is a must see area of Seoul  it has a lot of restaurants boutiques The main street has a lot of calligraphy and other artistic items to bring home including crockery Several art galleries free entries wonderful local eateries in the little alleyways The top prize goes to the Ongo cooking school where you can learn to make a few local dishes in 2 hours httpwwwongofoodcom  Palace is within walking distance as well All in all a must seeexperience in Seoul
13720,4,Go there and relax walk this street of Insadong there are many art galleries here
13721,3,An amazing place to find great traditional art pieces and souvenirs for friends back home
13722,4,Although we didnt purchase anything here we spent an enjoyable time wandering through the many alleys and small shops and had a lovely meal here
13723,4,Lots of ceramic shops and restaurants Interesting area of Seoul
13724,4,Insadong is a long and wide street with shops along the way U can find papers clothes acessories all those fancy stuff Go to the 4 storey shopping area dont know the name but huge visibility at the top level ull find a fancy ice stall like a mini garden A good spot to take picture There are lots of local snack stall along the way make sure to try the potato Nice taste
13725,3,It is a nice place to walk around but I dont think it lives up to the hype Myongdong is much more fun to walk around in and there is more to see there
13726,3,Many art shops but just as many cheap souvenir shops here Not impressed
13727,5,Would recommend this market on your list for sure Lots of shops picked up a name scroll and also Hello Kittys in hanboks There are lots of places to eat and lots of souvenir shops
13728,4,Some buildings are only open to tourists Great food coffee and sights If you like cream in your coffee ask about cream first before ordering coffee Very akward exchange if you dont
13729,3,Not the most interesting place you can find but it provides a look into the typical streets of Seoul
13730,4,Insadong is an art tourist area There were some fabulous art galleries and art stores which we had not found anywhere else No bartering here as there are too many tourists
13731,5,This place is full of yummy treats art pieces and unlimited selection of souvenirs would definitely go back to this side of Seoul in my next visit
13732,5,Lots to see and explore in this place There are also lots of interesting restaurants and cafes around Need to spare more time to explore
13733,5,Worth a visit when in Seoul Think about how you are going to ship the beautiful pottery and tapestries that you find in the boutique stores Insadong offers a street life that is enjoyable Ive heard that it is more busy on the weekdays instead of the weekends Enjoy the street food too
13734,5,Ssamziegil is cool chic and trendy Nice little shops with handmade or personal designs by young artists Comfy boulevard to walk along
13735,4,During holiday there is a lot of people and some students have a thing called Free Hugs for some reason I didnt bother to ask  I got a free hug
13736,5,Tourist street  buying will be expensive But there is a some unique shoesrestaurants Recommended to stroll here
13737,2,Enjoyable crowded stylish artistic happening colourful
13738,3,Ive been visiting Insadong every time Im in Seoul for the last three years I still like it but it seems like things are changing and it is becoming more upscale and prices are higher more highend shops restaurants fancier etc I liked the way it was before better but Id still visit
13739,4,Insadong is a fun little street where merchants sell hand crafts and local delights along with your typical tourist merchandise Great street super nice atmosphere and a great stroll
13740,5,I loved this area more antique and shops but just seemed quite relaxed so def worth a visit
13741,3,I like the little coffee shops here They are of characters and warm atmosphere The handcraft shops are also lovely Its a shame we do not have sufficient time to visit them all But we will come back
13742,5,Lots of great brick and mortar shops and plenty of places to get a great cheap tasty snack from a vendor Not nearly as flea marketesque as Itaewon Dongdaemung or Namdaemung VERY crowded but definitely worth the trip
13743,5,I love that it has lots of selection of restaurants to select I could try different meals on different time of the day  Its a place to shop for unique items not found elsewhere Lots of youngsters love to hang out here You will get to see interest artistic items here
13744,4,A very nice shopping place with friendly shop owners and negotiable prices
13745,5,Insadong is the best place that we went to for shopping  The shopping for souvenirs korea novelty items and clothing was great The prices were affordable and negotiable to a certain extent  We bought keychains traditional fans tshirts souvenir plates  We ate at a wonderful restaurant and there are 100s of choices there are also traditional food carts on the road to experiment and try some of the local delicacies  Insadong is a MUST do in Seoul
13746,5,Best place to souvenir shop Stop at the 4 story building about halfway down the street Would definitely recommend the soft serve green tea ice cream on the second floor Osulloc to buy some green tea; the Tea Museum is actually a tea shop and its a fun place to sit and have a tea
13747,4,This area is a must see on a trip to Seoul The area is stocked with traditional shops gifts foods It is full of tourists and the prices tend to be higher here than other areas however its a nice area to walk through and see
13748,5,All the senses get a work out herefrom the smells of food the artworks the array of clothes culturesthis place is well worth a look Easy access by train Insadong is lovely cobbled streets classy shops with lots to see and do You can idle away the hours easily hereMUST SEE in Seoul For lunchTry the Bibimbap  the SSamziegil Centredownstairs
13749,3,These markets depend on good weather to really show to their best advantage as our first day was blustery very wet and cold The second time we visited the sun was out and all the shops had stalls out the front  From handmade paper beautiful to fashion you have it all Ok to barter at this market Explore the side alleys too for food and crafts
13750,2,Enjoy daytime drinkingkkkkI have many conversation with him he camed from abroad to study meditaion with our group Thank you for the good time
13751,4,This caters to a different crowd from Dongdaemun and Namdaemun market I prefer shopping here as it is not noisy Galleries antique stores teahouses coffee outlets restaurants dotted the area
13752,3,Insadong was on our list of places to visit while in Seoul but we were disappointed on the makeup of the area it is very touristy we spent only about an hour here before moving on
13753,5,We kept coming back so much to see and buy Good food good art Forget the markets this is the place to spend your time
13754,4,Nice way to experience the culture and have tea Best finds are in the alleys believe it or not Plenty of places to find something to eat Most are OK some are just fine to pass by and grab a picture
13755,5,Liked everything about it Shops sold everything you can think of for yourself or gifts plus more We had the best steamed dumplings and street food here too
13756,5,We stayed near Insadong we visited a few times Great shopping if youre looking for cultural or traditional items
13757,5,A one stop place for souvenirs shopping Yoy will be spoilt for choice for local street food too
13758,4,We visited Insadong for interesting finds to take home for souvenirs and gifts There are also many art galleries and coffee shops and street foods Artsy pieces includes fashion accessories fans crafts house ornaments amethyst jewelries etc Plan to spend around 2 hours here to shop and have some snacks in between
13759,5,This is one of my favorite areas in Seoul I have been living here for 2 years I always bring friends and family that are visiting to Insadong It is just lovely If you are heading to Seoul make time to visit this area There are lots of tea shops and you can participate in a tea ceremony There are also wonderful and unique items to purchase for wonder souvenirs ENJOY
13760,5,the prices are cheap and the crafts are very artsy and there lots of items for souvenir
13761,4,A lot of shops different range of price Choose the small shopstall for cheaper bargain
13762,3,Its very crowded during weekend Nothing much or fanciful  It just one straight passage way walking through souvenirs shops and some restaurants  Its expensive though
13763,4,Lots of paintings street food see traditional arts and craft There are actual tour groups visiting this area Recommend to go on weekends to enjoy the crowds
13764,4,A traditional street selling lot of handmade craft and stuffs Just 1min walk from Anguk Stn and Insadong close for vehicles on Sunday here you can try hanbok for 30005000won at Insadong Tourism Information centre and any other traditional experience There are also a vegetarian restaurant called Sosim 5min walk from exit 6 Anguk stn Its at 2nd floor of GS25
13765,5,A little bit chaotic but worth the visit it is a in district and the center for art galleries and museum
13766,5,we do the caricature for KRW10000 each we do our own name Seal worth krw30000 as a momento
13767,4,Arty Farty place to chill out a little street food in this 500m stretch of easy walking area A lot of art pieces around if you can afford to buy it back
13768,4,When you are at insadong a must do is to explore the small alley You will find restaurant tea houses pubs art galleryetc The main street is lined with souvenirs stores Most of the gifts that are sold at insadong can also be found at Dongdaemun Look out for shops selling traditional korea craftwork porcelain and ceramic wares Also do not forget to check out Ssamziegi a shopping and art complex
13769,4,Nice part of Seoul I was told Insadong means cultural area in English Nice restaurants shops and galleries Imagine Camden Town in Asia 4 storey shopping center with no stairs is unique Dont miss it if you go to Seoul
13770,3,This area is more to old and antiques stuffs and have to go though many alleys but it was fun as we managed to see many things
13771,4,A little quieter than Myeongdong with most of the same gifts items for sale
13772,5,This area is the best value for money souvenir area in Seoul There are other places where you can spend lots more and even some where you can spend lots less but this is the best value for quality products
13773,4,for teashops and veggie restaurants though the chains are taking over and these days you have to watch out for madeinChina souvenirs
13774,5,just a fun area with great art and souvenirs just a really cool vibe to it
13775,5,Particularly liked the market off to one side Really wished Id bought that fish mobile now Really good shopping from cheap to expensive Plenty of choice
13776,5,Wonderful for window shopping and for buying nice gifts and prices are good compared to some other shopping areas An enjoyable place to spend half a day
13777,5,like the atmosphere of the area many nice restaurants  tea housescoffee houses
13778,4,Sightseeing charming small houses good restaurants shopping cultural things etc Nice area you shouldnt miss when your in Seoul
13779,4,If you like arty things ornaments textiles china pottery etc Cute and fun to explore
13780,4,I walked couple of times in the evening  its full of people shopping eating and relaxing after a busy day As anywhere in Korea its safe and comfortable
13781,5,could find traditional souvenirs and nice cafe Recommend to visit here if youre first time for Seoul
13782,5,If you want something to take home to friends family and coworkers this is truly the best place in all of Korea Speciality shops and allyoucanthinkofshops have unique souvenirs including kimchichocolate  The area also has numerous side streets for exploring things such as Tea Museums and Tea Houses and of course numerous dining options  Theres always a lot going on in this neighborhood so if youre trying to avoid crowds or tourists this isnt the place to go otherwise theres a reason so many folks line the streets its just pleasant
13783,5,Very touristy but a must see neighborhood Especially like it because of the number of vegetarian restaurants and art galleries The neighborhood a bit north of Insadong is the same kind of neighborhood but much less touristy
13784,4,Strolling through this area was fascinating and time flew by Did our souvenir shopping here and found some great craft stores
13785,5,Great place to shop and eat Lovely people with occasional events
13786,4,This street is full of stores selling very nice souvenir items A must place to visit Not very crowded but not idle There are several restaurants and street food vendors too
13787,5,This must see place is adjacent to Jongno gil which is walking distance from Doulos Hotel There is a photo booth that allows you to take picture from a scenic background of Insadong stage and send it to your email
13788,5,Loved this place I cant wait to go back Great tea places art galleries shopping everything
13789,5,i just loved the items sold there they are mostly handmade or hand crafted really unique
13790,4,Had some tea here in a little shop off the insadong rd Located close to the palaces and has a bunch of little shops selling hand bags and tea sets
13791,4,Insadong is a fabulous base for sampling the street food and arts of Seoul Also a convenient jumpingoff point for exploring the rest of this incredibly dynamic city
13792,5,Its not just for shopping the place is full of interesting structures and ideas
13793,5,They are many shops the whole street Many selling art and craft items and they are very interesting and original Many souvenirs items you can purchase there even though not cheap I manages to find earrings and accessories selling very cheap at one shop eg earring only 1000 won compare to what I bought in Namdemun for 20008000 won Those accessories are beautiful but not sure about quality
13794,5,The main Insadong area is a bit touristy and souveniroriented which is nice but if you stroll north past the girls middle school youll find an adjacent area thats much more relaxed and stylish Highly recommended 
13795,5,can be quite busy depending on the time and day but lots of shopping street food and nonstreet food to be had
13796,4,I like walking around soVery crowded though Just about anything one would want can be found in this market
13797,3,Perhaps we were on the wrong street Didnt see much of this place only about two blocks long Did we miss it
13798,3,The Seould City Tour bus dropped us off across the street from the entrance to Insadong If this is your first time visiting Insadong like us be sure to stop at the beginning of the main street There you will find an information booth for tourist that can help give you maps booklets information etc We asked for a recommendation to eat and they pulled out this binder full of information  perhaps too much information We just wanted lunch  Also right next to the booth was a little old lady selling fresh roasted chestnuts from her makeshift cart Delightful but I think it may have been overly priced for tourist  Sights and impressions of Insadong pleasant atmosphere no street hawkers to be found storefront loud speakers coaxing you to go in clean streets organized mixture of things to seedo Ssamzigil had shops showcasing independent art works and was nice to browse around in Because the price of food and souvenirs in this area seems to be slightly higher for the same things elsewhere in Seoul It definitely felt like a tourist spot but is definitely worth a stroll through
13799,4,Organized place to walk and shop Lotsa food place
13800,5,I liked it very much I recommend it to everyone
13801,5,Good aquarium Heavily themed for children Recommend using the discover Seoul app as this is included
13802,3,Good
13803,5,Its an excellently built aquarium Full of themed zones lots of exhibiting creatures and an entertaining show Suitable for all ages to visit
13804,4,good place for under Water world
13805,5,Am good place
13806,5,Absolutely worth a visit So many things to see I cant write about them all There are time slots where the public can see the animals being fed which is also very nice Probably the best aquarium Ive been to
13807,5,It such a memorable experience 
13808,5,Really nice aquarium for kids and adults We went on a Saturday in the summer and it was packed there were so many people We managed to get around fine though There were a ton of really great exhibits they have a huge shark tank seals manatees penguins and other various animal life My son loved an exhibit where you stick your hand in and little fish eat at the dead skin on your hand He thought this was the coolest thing ever It was clean and there were clean toilets throughout to stop at The price was decent and what I expected for something in the Coex mall It was a good thing to do with kids
13809,5,Good for kid and adult
13810,5,Awesome place where you can watch sea creatures and enjoyHas many sharks including Great White jelly fish and also beavers
13811,5,Beautiful and varied place I highly recommend visiting it
13812,5,It took about 15 minutes on foot from Sansei Station on Subway Line 2 I noticed on the way back but I arrived at Hoonji Station on Subway Line 9 in about 5 minutes
13813,3,Online booking does not except intl cards so pay up full price  Its ok but overpriced for what you get to see
13814,5,Great we love it
13815,4,One out of the great places to spend time with kids Stamping game is an interesting stuff for younger ages You can get a discount through web searching
13816,5,Good place to spend times with family
13817,5,nice cute animals
13818,3,I have to be a little honest here when I came first time to South Korea and went to the Aquarium in Coex I was fascinated and I really loved it BUT it was my first time visiting an Aquarium After that I had the opportunity to visit the one in Berlin and then another one in Spain Now coming back in 2022 10 years later I found it to be overpriced for what it is offering It is a nice place clean and well maintained However in 10 years I hardly see any improvement this probably depends on the fact that this Aquarium is located in a Shopping Mall If you havent been to any Aquarium  you will love it otherwise you could find yourself feeling a little bit disappointed
13819,5,Very pretty place
13820,5,The aquarium is awesome Maybe this is my first visit I really liked it I felt like I was underwater The aquarium is divided into 6 rooms The Legacy of the Inca Empire; Forests and lands of the Amazon; Inhabitants of the World Ocean; Open pool; Sea Predators; Secrets of the deep sea At the beginning you can take a brochure and as you pass through each hall you put stamps Perhaps it is interesting for children But I went with pleasure looked and put seals  as a keepsake You can also do a peeling massage on your hands fish A must visit
13821,5,Awesome
13822,5,Absolutely fantastic
13823,5,My kids were very happy we visited
13824,5,One of the must visit places in Korea There are all the varieties of fishes Had an amazing experience here Children will enjoy it the most It is better to book tickets in advance online to avoid queues
13825,5,Very pleasantly surprised Its a lot bigger on the inside than I expected it to be and it even had a few non aquatic animals I will say few of the fish did seem a bit ill and some of the tanks could be bigger
13826,5,Nice experience
13827,4,The tunnel under the water with the sharks swimming around wasnt as nice was the one in Guam There was a decent variety of aquatics and I keep getting the vibes that place was geared for kids with the Octonauts Cartoon theme throughout  There are seats for rest in a few areas One hour here is enough unless you stop to watch all the exhibits
13828,4,Very cute aquarium
13829,2,Price is excesive for what you get Not very big aquarium
13830,4,Very Nice Place to visit
13831,5,Variety of water species Great entertainment for kids
13832,5,Great aquarium hidden amongst the COEX shops and restaurants Interesting composition combining pedagogy and discovery
13833,5,Super
13834,2,the fish looks depressed
13835,5,My 2 year old enjoyed it almost as much as I did
13836,4,Enjoyable aquarium which is laid out nicely with some nice setpieces
13837,4,Very nice experience and diverse collection with sitting facilities and information desks
13838,5,Had a good time with the kids
13839,5,I love it
13840,4,Very modern and high tech facade Would love to have more directory of the shops around the huge building
13841,5,Unforgettable
13842,5,Really loved the aquarium Nicely planned and designed
13843,5,Great place for family day
13844,5,This is by far the best aquarium in Seoul hands down   So many sea animals
13845,5,Good experience
13846,2,Poor Aquarium and overpriced for a half hour to fourty minutes round
13847,5,A lot to see  nice photo spots
13848,5,Greet place
13849,5,This place never dissapoint
13850,5,amazing place
13851,5,Lovely place The best when visiting with kids
13852,5,It is quite interesting to get to know marine life let alone packaged in a certain theme or form such as places to eat traditional houses and so on The location is located inside a mall and has several objects that can spoil our eyes If you want to visit it is better to make a booking in advance to speed up entry to the area usually given a handtag before entering by the officer Lets be adventurous
13853,5,One of the best and most atypical I have visited The price on site is 32000 won I advise you to take it on the internet or on a tourist app to buy it You save a great deal As for the visit great diversity immersion and many surprises Good visit
13854,5,Great for family days or simply to visit and enjoy the atmosphere Lots of seating areas feeding times and a fun passport stamp booklet for children
13855,4,Nicely set up
13856,1,Might be a good place for kids if you want your kids to grow up with terrible morals and no respect for animals and life Came here in December of 2021 thinking COEX aquarium was a major tourist destination but was immensely disappointed when I saw 20 clown fish in a 20 gallon fish tank To add to it there were about 20 OTHER fish living in the tank There were no plants no anemones for the clown fish to live in AND it was the first tank on display  There were two manatees A dangerously endangered species literally in a tank not even two manatees long No plants Cruelty  Visit COEX aquarium to experience cruelty at its maximum potential
13857,3,The price is cosmic and he himself is small There is something to compare therefore for such a price they should at least show a show there At the exit there is a store with all sorts of toys at somewhat inflated prices to provide a tantrum for children who want everything at once
13858,5,Had an amazing time at the CoEx Aquarium
13859,5,Best aquariums with all kinds of aquatic animals
13860,5,very fun there is a price list in Russian
13861,3,Cool experience even for adults
13862,4,Amazing
13863,4,Ah i missed reviewing this one A small but neat aquarium me think  the staffs were kind and helpful pretty aquariums setting they dont have that many fish varieties but thats okaaay Located inside coex mall just in case youre confused 
13864,4,Very nice
13865,5,One of the best aquarium place My own opinion I like it more than the one at Osaka Not too big but good organized
13866,5,Good aquarium
13867,4,Great
13868,4,Very nice reduction if you follow the Instagram account of the aquarium
13869,5,Very beautiful place and so many different type of fish available here
13870,5,Its good experienced I love to be there There many kind of fishes and its really refreshing
13871,4,Nice place for vacation
13872,5,Nice place to bring small children
13873,5,Hi  COEX AGUARIUM is located in the Cannes area Very wonderful place to hold a tour and recreation in general There is aquarium below 0 marks The territory under Earth is very big there is everything to satisfy all the desires  I advise everyone
13874,5,Cool there are sharks there
13875,5,Good
13876,1,Mind blowing amazing
13877,5,Interesting
13878,5,One of the best places
13879,5,Its cheaper if you book your entrance ticket via the internet
13880,2,Dont expect much here as the place is quite small Not much variety of fishes Mainly common lake fishes takes up 80 of the space
13881,5,Recommend it especially if you dont have such a place in your own country 
13882,3,I feel very small and shallow probably because I am accustomed to Kaiyukan I was surprised that the skin diver came down
13883,4,Tickets are a bit expensive and havent come After the visit I feel that the layout is very good the museum is big enough and there are many species An aquarium worth visiting
13884,5,Excellent location to be in peace while watching fishes The shark tank is insanely beautiful and all the tanks are very clean
13885,4,Good aquarium but not stroller or wheelchair accessible
13886,5,I liked it very much I made a lot of beautiful photos By the way if you come there with your family they will make a good discount we got about 40 The kids liked it
13887,5,Penguins
13888,4,Aquarium was well maintained and it boasts of wide variety of aquatic animals It was just mesmerizing If would be equipped with audio guide then nothing can beat this
13889,5,best tour point in the seoul this have many beautiful photo spot
13890,3,I dont know The space for fishes to move around are very limited And even some of the aquarium are quite crowded and dirty In short I feel sorry for the fishes or other animals over there
13891,4,Worth to spend time with kids
13892,5,Best in Seoul
13893,5,We loved this especially with the kiddos 
13894,5,Huge and wonderful place
13895,4,Cool place fo relax and enjoy mood
13896,3,A lot of small fish tanks I dont feel huge aquarium But so many types of fishes
13897,5,Amazing collection of fish sharks rays and turtles
13898,5,Cutest aquarium ever  Love the theme 
13899,5,Lots to see Tunnel isnt very long
13900,4,Cool
13901,5,Awesome aquarium with a mix of BIG and little marine life There are a few cute spots to take pictures at and stamps to fill out your brochure as you go along the path Sadly I traveled without my boyfriend this timeso I was lonely at the places couples could take pictures at  I would definitely recommend this for children too It seems like a very educational place with the kids in mind My favorite place was seeing the sharks and stingrays near the underwater tunnels You can get really nice pictures there  I would definitely like to come back with my boyfriend
13902,5,The best aquarium They had every sea creature including otters beavers penguins and another animal with dog in it I forgot  Walking in a hallway with a tank around you Can feed animals and all types of fish Family friendly date friendly and just hanging out friendly Cool for the Coex mall around it too
13903,5,A five star experience  this aquarium is much more colorful and unique than other aquariums we have visited without being cheesy or over the top  We enjoyed seeing the colorful displays and different types of fish
13904,5,Nice place for a family vacation on weekend have a big varieties of fishes too which is unexpected for aquarium under a mall
13905,1,I do not know what I expected but certainly I did not expect crammed species in tiny fishtanks showing no respect for life I felt as if I was at one of those retaurants where you choose the fish you want them to cook for you
13906,5,Nice experiencelooks like you are in sea
13907,3,It feels expensive but it can be said that the scale is large I buy the idea of putting fish in various containers but I feel a little pity I would like to say that if we could increase the number of contact corners and shows it would be a step up
13908,5,Nice place Killer sharks are amazing
13909,5,class 
13910,5,Great
13911,5,There are many marine animals many species very beautiful
13912,5,Amazing
13913,5,Excellent
13914,5,Great place for a family hike
13915,5,Pretty nice atmosphere A lot of fishes and other sea animals You can also participate many programs It was quite exciting Nice cafe and cute dolls I bought one from here and my girl friend was quite satisfying One of the best aquarium ever i have visited If you like sea environment i strongly recommend Perfect place for your date as well
13916,5,Nice
13917,4,Mainly for kids or newbies Considering what aquariums are like in other countries a bit small and cozy Not aimed to impress with huge fishes but has some a few spots with good configuration to take pictures in and around Near the end of the course there are cute little penguins which are fed at 330 So preferably start the tour at around 245 and take seats before the penguins around 15 minutes before the show Of course the seat availability depends on the number of visitors which you need to take into account so as to watch penguins eating comfortably on the chair Have a nice tour
13918,5,Nice place special for kids
13919,5,Its giid to be here
13920,5,It is located inside the complex of COEX There are so many exotic marine animals inside the aquarium You will feel like you are surrounded by marine life when you visit this place If you are interested in marine life you will enjoy visiting this place
13921,3,For kids
13922,1,This aquarium improperly houses many of its inhabitants and creatures Multiple loaches available for handson entertainment were dead or dying from being mishandled by so many young children to the point where I saw a couple turning their bellies up and bleeding from their gills in the water There were no employees watching over the area either to keep an eye on the fish  Ive seen healthier loaches available for purchase at fish markets in Seoul Not only does this seem despicably cruel it seems unsanitary especially for the young children who like to visit I understand in Korea we have different ethics and views on the treatment of animals but these arent even for consumption Theyre there for mediocre and grotesque entertainment Had a child dropped a fish onto a floor and left it there without their parent intervening that fish would have remained there for who knows how long  The aquarium itself is sparse with few attractions most of them jampacked with fish to the point where calling them overcrowded in a single tank is an understatement Many of these fish are subjected to bright and whimsical but very fishunfriendly tank designs such as doll houses furniture and outdoor fixtures that they are housed in They arent treated as specimens to maintain but attractions to spice up and add flare to  The larger animals do not fare much better Quite a few reviews mention this but the manatees seals and other macrofauna are visibly housed in extremely small enclosures I do not know if they have larger back tanks but given the way the fish tanks are kept I dont have high hopes  The actual Coex building is charming spacious and has many wonderful attractions and food joints to visit But please if you walk by this aquarium walk past it
13923,5,You can meet various fish and animals that live in water here In addition you can see performances in the water and participate in various programs such as feeding experiences So make sure to take a camera or cell phone that you can take pictures with Discount events are always under way for many people so it is effective to check the website and visit there There is also a parking space so you can go without any burden There was a souvenir shop so I could come back home with good memories
13924,5,They are so many unique fishes and entertaining shows You can buy cute soft toys as a souvenir when you leave the place
13925,1,Wasnt aware that they had manatees before my visit Manatees seals and penguins all in VERY depressing enclosures The manatee tank was completely bare and far too small for these animals I found it quite upsetting and left swiftly after seeing these poor animals Better conditions needed this is the 21st century  have some compassion
13926,3,Ive been to many aquariums and thought this one was just okay There were many families with small children and they were having a great time Theres a lot of activities for kids  Interactive stations were cool I went with my grown son and he didnt enjoy it much Definitely visit if you have small children Theres a good variety of marine life The layout of the place was great
13927,4,We have a fantastic ocean world in my home city one of the best Ive ever seen but this aquarium blew me away Its huge and theres different themed areas as you go along Its nicely set up and they had sealife that I had never seen in my life I got a ticket online at Klook which saved me about 2025 You can also get a flyer at the mall with a 15 discount coupon The feedings are done by divers The mermaid show I really wanted to see and waited around for an hour or so was a dissapointmentthe mermaids only swam up and down two or three times and then turnes into humans because that was their wishI also didnt like the touching lab as I saw kids grabbingfish starfish poking them and taking them out and throwing them back in no supervision Other than that great aquarium
13928,3,Tickets are over priced Will not visit again They had a decent variety of Marine life on display Perhaps good to bring kids there
13929,5,Not a fan of aquariums but this one was really great Huge variety of amazing fish is never seen before very curious and strange aquatic creatures Huge tanks so lots of room to see and makes me feel at least a little bit better about the fish being kept captive Its got a lot of crazy stuff to see and the price is worth it
13930,5,Bought 4 tickets to coex aquarium via Klook and it cost us approx SGD25 per paxwith the experience Many interesting sea creatures penguins sharks walruses etc especially love their interactive stations where they allow u to touch the sea creatures eg starfish clams fishes They even have a fish spa area Very suitable for families with children My elderly parents loved it too Totally worth the trip  the layout of the whole area is v well thought out Foreigners also get to experience a free hanbok experience
13931,2,After reading the reviews on tripadvisor we were quite excited to go here However it just felt over priced  The whole theme is Octonauts a kids tv show so clearly it was aimed towards really young children The fish habitats include the octonauts toys  Having been to many aquariums the fish here just look quite miserable Many of them felt lifeless and its unclear if its due to their environment being intruded by the colourful toys The manatee aquarium especially looked too small for the beautiful creatures who were staying at the bottom and could barely float vertically without having to bend Too many tanks that were just too small  The place seemed to be centered around what kids want Its bright and colourful The baby shark song was playing throughout and almost drove me insane  The area for Doctor Fish to bite at your skin is not monitored A kid put her whole hand in and started swishing the water violently The touch pool was also not monitored Kids could just lift up and throw the creatures without any care for the guidelines stated More thought should be put into this  Feeding sessions are turned into ways to educate kids about the wildlife which i thought was done very well The amazonian wildlife area was also well constructed that i was amazed Many of the fish were bigger than the ones i have seen in other places which is also good My favourite parts were the pairie dog enclosure which is ironic since it is not a sea creature The stamp collecting thing they have is pretty cool too since i am a teenager and still willing to run around collecting them  Overall the priority here seems to be the kids However the welfare of the animals should not be compromised in trying to do so It felt a little sad to look at some of them Aesthetic should always take a backseat when animals are involved
13932,5,The Aquarium is great for all ages If you are there at the right time there is shark feeding at 130pm and feeding for other select tanks at 330pm They are very efficient and effective with the use they have and some of the smaller aquarium tanks are artistic design and fun for all ages There is also one are where kids can tough sea creatures and one tank you can put your hands in and the fish will nibble the dead skin off The Aquarium is a good size and there is one place in there halfway through if you have a hankering for a snack or some ice cream There are many places outside the aquarium where you can eat before or after There is a fun stamp book for kids as they go through to find stamps along the way
13933,5,I make it a point to see this aquarium every time I visit Seoul Many varieties and I like their collection of exotic shrimps A mustsee in Seoul Great for children and adults I usually schedule to see it when the weather is not good for outdoor photography Easily accessible by subway and is close to the Bongeunsa Temple too The COEX has a spectacular book library on the ground floor so next time when you visit the aquarium visit also the library and the nearby temple This year they have a chipmunk in addition to prairie dogs
13934,5,Really nice aquarium  a nice place had a lot of activities around it to a must visit place and you will not be dissappointed
13935,5,The fun is in the inner areas Navigate to see crabs and otters inside Theyre amazingly huge and colourful
13936,5,The visit to the COEX Aquarium in this Seoul tour has become a very good gift for me I didnt think of any variety of marine life in Korea and the various sea kingdoms I experienced in Korea became unforgettable memories
13937,5,My family very love this place Its very beautiful especially the Mermaid Show was really amazing 
13938,3,Dont get me wrong  if you have kids its a great interactive activity As adults having seen other aquariums this is average The exhibits are catering for children so instead of trying to replicate natural habitats in the tanks a lot have childish toys in them like a kids gold fish bowl The aquarium does cover a range of different environments in the world  theres an Amazon rain forest including large otters A desert area with phararie dogs A section with manatees  then penguins The viewing tunnel with sharks  rays doesnt have the larger species but there is some impressive sharks Overall a good few hours if rainng or for the kids Not the cheapest option so use your Discover Seoul pass to pay
13939,5,My daughter soo happy in here Many fish and interactive features inside for tourist you can wear hanbok for free every weekdays and take photo for free First  i guess the aquarium was small but when you entered all the corner i think this aquarium is quiet big If you have family to travel with you should go to this place Take subway to Bongeunsa Station And follow the path to COEX Aquarium
13940,4,Nice place for a rainy day Very cool sea animals Cost 28000 each If you have kids they will enjoy
13941,5,Went on a rainy day and it was super fun  a huge variety of fish and small animals a very well designed halls  great to take pictures  Worth it
13942,1,This is an overly commercial exploitation of living animals We have visited many aquariums in the world and this one was one of the worst the tanks were way too small for the animals within them especially the larger animals like manatees crocodile and the larger fish that were swimming around the tank in circles bumping into the glass walls and clearly very uncomfortable with the small size of the tank  There was a section where you could handle and touch sea creatures and within this section were dozens of tanks and no staff around with little children poking and squeezing the creatures continually whilst the parents sat on phones The entire aquarium is overcrowded with tourists too many of them are very pushy and disrespectful and will literally push you out of the way to get themselves in the front of the glass there is no information about conservation or how to protect these animals the place was very clearly set up to be a commercial hub  Just please dont do it it is heartbreaking to see the animals trapped in such small and overcrowded tanks AVOID
13943,4,The aquarium is pretty good with an assortment of displays and some unique creatures Its not unlike other good and modern aquariums around the world It is a great change of pace from temples and palaces if you want to get out of the heat with kids
13944,3,Just like other reviews here the reason why we went to this aquarium is to fill out the use of our Discover Seoul Pass The entrance fee to Coex is on the high side and will easily justify the cost of the Discover Pass This is one of two aquariums that is available for entry by the Discover Pass and this is one is much better as the other one felt more like an oversized aqua pet shop  Some displays are in ponds some are in big tanks but a lot are in aquarium tanks sizes However the aquarium tanks are big for a lot of the fishes so these provide great viewing opportunities The fish spa experience allows one to feel the doctor fish nibble on your hand  The coex mall has also been upgraded as compared to the last time I went here a long time ago
13945,4,We went to Coex aquarium because it is part of the Discover Seoul Pass and we can enter for free if we bought the pass We were really not interested in going to the aquarium at first as we have been to a lot of big aquariums so we were not expecting something great from an aquarium in a mall Please note that I am an avid Aquarist and I love to visit public aquariums my kids also love them as well  When we got there though we were happily surprised the aquarium was well presented the layout was nice and the exhibits were well kept I think there was some confusion about the two types of Arawanas though as they bunched both the asian ones and the amazon ones in the same area  They also had a few Mammals on exhibit the Prairie dogs and the African Manatees were really cute and we were lucky that we were there during feeding time Penguins were also nice as well  The kids loved the experience of the Garra Rufa or Fish spa fish after they were asked to wash their hands and then put them in the tank with the fish the kids stayed there for maybe 10minutes  If I were to give improvement suggestions to the aquarium I would say put more explanation on all the exhibits environment diet conservation status etc and also make sure english translation is accurate  I can say that the exhibits is comparable to the Ocean Park aquarium in Manila except that they do not have the outdoor shows which is fine by me  One new thing that the kids learned at the aquarium is how to determine if a shark is male or female  I would say that we all loved the Nursery where we saw baby seahorses and pregnant male seahorses the Axolotl is also a favorite of my kids  I would highly recommend going to this Aquarium if you love fishes
13946,4,Big Aquarium inside the COEX Mall Well maintained with lots of sea creatures to see the main attractions were the diving penguins and the Piranha fish very informative and a good place to go to if youd want to rest from the humid weather outside espduring Summer Months in Seoul June
13947,3,This aquarium is nothing special at all Do not expect to be wowed by anything unique or creative Unless you have never been to an aquarium or have children that demand you take them there do not waste your time and skip this activity There are better things to do in Seoul
13948,5,A really fun and visually impressive aquarium The layout and design of each area is well thought out Multiple observation rooms give great opportunities to see a large number of unique beautiful fishies and other animals Add this place to your must see list if you are in the area
13949,5,One of the best things about Coex Aquarium according to our 3 years old girl are the Octonauts She was more impressed with a room where she could push a button and start the song than with all the sharks fish turtles and other amazing beings It was also interesting to see the feeding And the navigation system with stamping was also nice Overall we had a great time there Maybe would like to have a bit more buttons and Octonauts around That was the girls opinion
13950,5,My husband and I decided to visit the Coex Aquarium when we were in Coex mall and it was one of the highlights of our trip to Seoul You can see many different interesting sea animals Highly recommended
13951,4,Good Aquarium in the COEX shopping malliPad   
13952,3,Not a lot of information on display Might be better for kids Not really somewhere you NEED to go to when in Seoul
13953,3,They have quite a few interesting exhibits that I have not seen in other aquariums but overall the place is built for kids and the adults might find it boring if theyve been to other aquariums
13954,5,Lots of things to see Nicely decorated Big and spacious My kids 8 and 2 years old enjoyed a lot There are also some interactive exhibits that you can touch the sea creatures
13955,4,We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Coex Aquarium  the first aquarium I have ever seen inside of a shopping mall It was a bit overpriced even with the tourist discount we got thanks to a travel brochure we picked up at the airport The displays are quirky and unique and even boasted some sea life such as manatees which we hadnt seen in any of our aquariums back home Overall a fun experience and a lovely outing if you have kids or if you are looking for something to do indoors on a very cold andor rainy day
13956,4,If you like aquariums it is a mustsee in Seoul I liked to visit the aquarium whilst in Seoul especially when the weather was bad and the parks were wet This was my second visit and there was no noticeable change However watching the various creatures in the aquarium was quite relaxing and entertaining This time I tried to refine my camera skills for shooting tropical fishes; the results were not bad
13957,4,The aquarium is huge and many interesting exhibits suitable for a trip with kids The place is also quite spacious and not crowded on weekdays
13958,5,Our son loved the aquarium If you need to spend a day inside this is a great place to do it There are a ton of people there however so go early
13959,3,We have visited many aquariums around the world and to be honest we found this one quite bizarre  plastic toys and cartoon characters in the fish tanks video game machines next to the displays the mermaidclown fish show rabbits and prairie dogs vending machines everywhere so you were constantly trying to avoid bumping into people who were eating and drinking The otter beaver and penguin enclosures were really depressing Having said that it was very busy the day we visited and there were many families with young children who seemed to be enjoying it but I would find it hard to recommend to anyone else
13960,5,lovely experience mesmerising water world it was indeed a experience to watch the colourful water world at the Coex aquarium it was convent form the Coex convention centre
13961,4,This is a fun aquarium for young kids In contrast to the educational scientific approach this aquarium focuses on being fun and lively First part of aquarium had ovtonauts related displays then there is a place where you can touch doctor fish and star fish There is also a shark area and some penguins Its a nice place to spend about 90 mins with kids under seven but not much larger than that
13962,5,I have been here three times in four years and all was good Pros 1 Nice and clean aquarium 2 A lot of varieties 3 Nice Ambience 4 Not tiring 5 Photo areas 6 Nicely instructed 7 GoodGreat staffs  Cons 1 Overpriced I have visited it before and the price was half of it Suddenly increased the price
13963,5,The price is a bit expensive if youre on a a budget but I think its well worth it The aquarium is so quirky with some of the displays but also very good at taking care of the animals There are lots of different exhibits and activities to take part in this place would be especially good of you have children traveling with you as they would in my opinion love it Plenty of bathrooms and vending machines so was never thirsty or needing the loo All of the staff that I encountered were very nice too
13964,5,Lots to see very well displayed with lots of information also in English  many creatures that we hadnt seen before in aquariums in England Funny that they put fish in random things like a phone box and fridge Would definitely recommend a visit if you like sea creatures Loved the otters they were so cute 
13965,4,Went there at 12pm with a group of young kids over the summer Just in time to catch the sea animals feeding schedule There was a small touch pool and also a hand spa from doctor fish What an experience for the kids It took us about 3 hours to finish the whole thing as we also took quick snack break There is a snack cafe which sells hot dog sausage ice cream and drinks There are many drinks vending machine in the aquarium too  If you simply want to see some sea marine the tour usually takes 115 hours
13966,3,Me and my family likes to visit the aquariums in the towns and countries we are visiting Coex Aquarium was pretty average when it comes to content as soon as you forget or scratch out the fact that there are plastic toys and lego buildings in some of the tanks for the small fishes  I had never seen seacows in real life so that was definetly a new one for me  A big positive was that they seem to keep the tanks clean and also the glasseswindows If you like aquariums and arent bothered about a few toys and lego buildings among the fishes I would recomend this as an activity 
13967,5,This has got to be the most amazing attraction that I visited while in Seoul The Aquarium is smartly divided into different sections so visitors especially children can learn a lot of things about marine life Its great for families friends and couples too The best thing about Coex aquarium is that a wide range of species can be found here and they all are displayed creatively The mermaid show was amazing as well The whole place is clean and spacious I would love to visit it again
13968,5,Amazing variety of sea life displayed in most imaginative surroundings like kitchen sinks and fire extinguishers And why not Impressive larger animals like rays were fascinating This place is more than its location under a super mall promises The only negative was missing supervision as children were touching some petting animals much more than recommended  parental guidance is obviously not enough
13969,5,The place was surprisingly bigger than I expected and they have a huge variety of species on display The displays were organized and has a theme which was interesting There was an experiential part of the aquarium where visitors get a chance to get close and even touch the creatures However there was no staff to supervise the visitors There are also rest areas for families with children and vendo machines to buy refreshments They also have a scheduled shows  The place is great for families couples and even for solo travellers There is more to this place than just fish so be sure to visit It is also very near SM Town musuem
13970,2,Was supposed to be a highlight of our trip to Seoul  While the whole attraction as a whole was really good the touch pool was appalling I am all for aquariums allowing their guests to touch the different kinds of sea creatures on display for education but i strongly feel that these interactions must be closely and strictly monitored by staff This was absent at COEX Kids I dont blame them I blame their parents  adult guardians were squeezing these poor creatures I am very sure that these creatures were feeling tortured If theres no staff to supervise dont open the touching pool  To further my disappointment there was a sign saying that feeding for the pirahnas was starting at a certain time but it never happened  In all honesty the only positive I took from the visit was that I got to see turtles and a cowfish  Unless COEX improves their standards I will never visit the aquarium again
13971,4,Went here on a weekday around 1pm They have special shows which are usually done in the afternoon starting at 130pm We bought our tickets online via Klook which was about 2 cheaper than buying it instore  Overall experience was great although there were a number of tanks that do not contain the species being described on the signboards  We spent more than 3 hours there because we tried to watch all the available shows and read almost all descriptions shown on the tanks
13972,5,This was one of the better aquariums we have seen and the exhibits were set up in way which was interesting and fun for young children  We finished the walk through the exhibits within two hours but missed the shows which tend to be in the afternoon particularly over the weekend  there are less shows on weekdays
13973,4,This aquarium is Octonautthemed and my boy loves it There are many different areas classified based on geographical zones with petting area to interact with the marine creatures This place is highly recommended for families with kids
13974,3,We saw great reviews about this Aquarium so stopped by I guess if you have small kids its a great place for them to wander around If not well dont expect Sea World Its a pretty compact  a bit handmade aquarium that is part of the mall
13975,4,It is surprisingly large given that it is situated inside the COEX an expensive place in the heart of the city I had visited numerous large aquariums but still managed to find something interesting There was a locker facility at a small charge and that was helpful The staff were particularly helpful although they did not speak much English
13976,5,Surprised how big this place is once we were inside Great collections and childrens program Nice and clean Enjoyed it
13977,4,We didnt expect much as it was a last minute decision to visit  It was a weekday so the crowd was few and far in between  The variety of animal was a surprise Although it was meant to be an aquarium but we also got to see prairie dogs and beavers  The sardine show was good and entertaining  Would recommend if you have a few hours to spare
13978,5,My husband and I took our 6 month old baby to the aquarium on a rainy day and had a wonderful time We were amazed at how beautifully maintained and clean all the tanks in the aquarium are The animals seem very well taken care of We especially enjoyed the quirky section of the aquarium where fish are living in all sorts of funny places  a telephone booth glass lanterns tupperware inside a refrigerator etc It was entertaining for our baby as well as us adults I would definitely go back
13979,2,looks like the concept has been brought without giving adequate thoughts to make it stand out compared to its peers  Very expensive to the boot
13980,5,This aquarium has the greatest variety of fish Ive ever seen It even has penguins I really liked the theme each room had and you can even touch some of the creatures there like the starfish Great for family trips
13981,3,The aquarium is tucked away in the mall but easy enough to find with adequate signs pointing the way It was a bit underwhelming but large enough to keep you entertained for a couple of hours
13982,5,Ive done some Aquariums but this one is really welldone There are a lot of animals that I didnt have the chance to see before that day The visit will take you around 2 or 3 hours The entrance is around 20 euros but its totally worth it 
13983,5,i was first a little takenaback by how up close and personal you are with apex predators and the lot it was absolutely a one of a kind unique experience that none of us will forget if youre out here for some unholy reason do yourself a favor and dedicate a couple hours here
13984,3,It was an ok experience but way too expensive for what it has to offer Not impressive and the entrance was around 25000w
13985,4,Many species Not only under sea habitats So very interesting large main pool with big sharks and turtles Worth it
13986,5,youd think an aquarium inside the basement of a mall would be lacklustre but wow youd be wrong This place is huge and has so many different areas You can spend a couple hours in here easily It has pretty much all the staples of a good aquarium Theres a shark tank otters an underwater tunnel educational things jelly fish and some extra trendy stuff It isnt the best aquarium Ive been to by far but it gets a 5star simply because it was way better than expected Easily accessible by subway and you can spend a whole day here if you like malls Watch a movie eat some food go to a temple across the street go to an arcade all on a subway stop This place is also one stop on bus from the airport for about 15 bucks So even a great stop over spot when in Korea
13987,4,Our family of five had a wonderful time in the Coex Aquarium Many different areas to explore and Santa was diving with the fish There were lots of kids and families but never felt too crowded Lots to see and fun exhibits There was a food festival on the front of the Coex on this particular year day and we had a great lunch The Aquarium was the perfect place to get out of the cold
13988,5,Was a great day out with the kids as shopping mall next door We spent about 2 hrs there very easy to get to Great indoor activity if weather is bad
13989,4,Visited this Aquarium alone at Coex mall Centrally located and provide best view of all varieties of marine lifes Best time to go alone with friends and family members
13990,5,This is the best aquarium I have been so far The environment is really good kids have opportunity to touch in some kind of attractions alive the glasses surrounding the aisle give us an impressive sensation and kids are surprised all the time
13991,4,Been to Seoul a couple of times and this is our first visit to the aquarium The aquarium is located in coex mall with plenty of shopping and restaurants The aquarium itself wasnt big you can basically cover the whole place in a hour or so There are some very innovative display of the fishes in this place eg a water dispenser filled with fishes a fire extinguisher acts as a fish tank etc Pretty interesting The rest are pretty much your usual aquarium stuffs Go if you are traveling with young kids they will love the place
13992,1,This Aquarium its nothing special It depends a lot on what have you saw before So if you have been before in great aquariums forget about this one its small and has nothing special to see and it seams that they dont take very well care about the animals there But if you are with little kids and dont know what to do i thing you can go there and enjoy
13993,4,I visited the Coex Aquarium with a friend There were plenty of different types of fishes and is an interesting place for fish lovers Im posting photos to show the fishes
13994,5,This is a must see for visitors to Seoul Wonderfully laid out allow time to see all the exhibits They are diverse and children are especially catered for with interactive games One of the best laid out aquariums we have visited Many species to excite interest with waterfalls and ponds an attractive addition
13995,5,We visited as part of an organised tour this is a good little aquarium with fish in a variety of quirky settings Its well worth a visit and not too expensive
13996,3,The aquarium is located within Coex mall and is designed to be kids friendly It was interest to see innovative way of displaying the fishes in the aquarium like retrofitting an old telephone broth into a fish tank
13997,5,Spent 25 amazing hours with 4 children aged 2 to 9 in this aquarium Highly recommend to anyone with and without children
13998,4,This place is much better than the one at the Coex Centre in Seoul My 7yearold had a great time there especially feeding the fish Really liked the variety of fish and animals You can buy discounted tickets through Gmarket You can do the aquarium in the morning and Kidsania in the afternoon if you have enough energy Kids will have a perfect day
13999,5,I visited this Coex aquarium on the last day at Seoul after attending a conference After checking out at the hotel I could take the hand luggage into the aquarium and walk around that was the reason  to pass time while hanging on to my hand luggage Within the coex mall the aquarium is nicely planned with lot of species  sharks penguins live corals Full price is high but you get instant 15 discount with the coupon you find there I guess the locals get better discounts when they bring their kids It takes about two hours to see the aquarium leisurely There are places inside to sit and watch the marine life for longer It cannot be any better
14000,5,Arrived at coex mall for some shopping and decided to hit the Aquarium first with our 4 year old; she loves sea creatures  Weve been to a fair few aquariums around the world and this one has a really cute and quirky display We really enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and so did our daughter The doctor fish part was probably our favourite  Lots of fresh water sea life from all part of Asia really interesting to see  Would definitely visit again
14001,5,My expectations were low for an aquarium in a shopping mall but the Coex Aquarium houses an incredible variety of animals
14002,4,Its a very big aquarium with so many separate sections for fishes and animals Saw different and unique varieties of fishes and sea creatures It took 2 hrs approximately for us to finish the tour of aquarium Overall a good place
14003,4,The best thing about this aquarium is that its not very big which is ideal for a little toddler  its just nice for him and and spent a few hours here Dont expect to see aquariums like seaworld etc and youll enjoy it
14004,5,Spent 3 hours here one afternoon Well worth the price; make sure you take a picture at the poster in the mall for 10 off Its inside the mall and a little hard to find but once inside it is a blast So many different fish tanks and so much to see The shark tank at the end is amazing and big enough to really make you feel like youre inside the ocean Well worth the price
14005,5,Best aquarium Ive ever been to Not normally one to visit aquariums but we visited after a full day tour of Panjumeon and the DMZ and needed a change of pace  We only had 90 minutes here as they were closingeasily could have spent more time here  The themed areas are very cute and I loved their inventive displays  especially the area with fish displayed in phone booths and fridges Great wee bit where you can lie on a bed and just watch fish Enjoyed the musical fish who interact with their space creating random notes  Impressive shark tank and installations and the English translations of the different fish are very cute Only down side  some animals need larger enclosures
14006,5,We went here July 2016 with our daughter We love coex and it was beautiful but we do not manage to see the live show
14007,2,My son was utterly disappointed after reaching the site its rather small And compared to other Aquariums in Hong kong singapore and Thailand its nothing
14008,4,well designed in the center of an underground mall adjacent to the COEX conference center and the Grand Intercontinental hotel Rich in items especially nice for children
14009,5,We bought the tickets for 25k each Well spent We where in there for about 23 hours There were alot of activities for both adult and children to enjoy They had a good variety of different fish
14010,5,An educational experience and fun for all ages well organised and friendly staff sardine love show is so enchanting
14011,3,We went on a Monday and it wasnt very crowded The main attraction is the huge aquarium with sharks manta rays and turtles which was quite impressive Everything else felt like it was just filler Great for small kids though Lots of activities to keep them engaged  We paid 50000 Won for 2 people and I felt for what was offered it was a bit overpriced Wouldnt go again necessarily but I didnt regret going in the first place
14012,5,There were species we had never seen before and some which we did not expect to see in an Aquarium lovely collection by any standards and definitely worth the visit
14013,4,We went here with our 2 boys aged 6  2They had a blast looking at all the different fish stingrays sharks turtles and other sea life They even had some other animals such as Beavers Otters and Penguins This aquarium was nicely laid out with 16 different stations I would allocate around 12 hours for this attraction I think some of the main features of this aquarium are the Huge Ocean Kingdom with all the sharks The Fish in Wonderland which show fish in all diferent types of unique aquariums The Amazonia World which show marine life from The Amazon River and The Marine Touch Lab to where the kids can touch certain marine life This attraction is stroller friendly My only drawback would be that this attraction is sort of on the pricey side with adults costing 25000 each youths 22000 and children 312 19000 krw
14014,5,This was our second visit to the aquarium Hours of wonder and fun with the fish and other animals including the otters beavers penguins My teenage son still loved the squirrel most but we all enjoyed the colours and tranquility of the aquariums Well worth the visit
14015,4,We enjoyed walking around learning  viewing Its a good aquarium but not great like Singapore Loved the quirky house area where marine life were in everyday home areas bed heads fridges kitchen sinks etc
14016,4,We have been twice The first time we absolutely loved this aquarium The second time it was a little different Zoos and aquariums are always a little sad when looking at how small the enclosures are for the animalssea creatures If you are able to look passed this then you will enjoy the aquarium very much like we did the first time
14017,4,I enjoyed this place with my wife and we had a fun time checking out the fish and it was a lovely place and when you are done can you eat lunch in Coex It is not a must see but fun place if you lived her for a longer time or if you have kids
14018,3,This was a nice sized aquarium where you could get close to the fish and exhibits It would be a great place to go with kids
14019,5,We were pleasantly surprised that Coex Aquarium can rival the SEA Aquarium in Singapore Considering that Coex Aquarium was inside a mall we did not expect much We were pleasantly surprised to see that it was very modern and had as much attractions as SEA Aquarium in Singapore They even had penguins and huge sharks which my kids really enjoyed watching And for its price it was well worth it
14020,3,Frankly speaking the value for money is not so good in Coex Aquarium There are not so many animals here this attraction is more for chldren than for adults even though there were some interesting spots However I will not recommend a visit to this aquarium and if I could come back to the past I would save 25000 Wonsticket and skip this attraction COEX shopping mall itself is not very interesting also however it is a kind of mustsee in Seoul as it is considered to be one of the biggest in the world
14021,5,I have been to several aquariums but this is by far the best Great tour inside plus a show as well Nice experience for people of ALL ages
14022,5,This is one of the good places to visit with families You will find various specious of sea fishes and ocean hunters like sharks
14023,3,We love visiting the aquarium at every single city we travel if it has one Seoul was not an exception and we chose COEX as we were told a lot about it The entrance was easily found Staff was friendly The aquarium seemed to be large and well organized with some areas where guest could play with the fish and ocean creatures The big fish and penguin however looked so tired and boring Since we were there around 11am with no show at that time so we did not really enjoy it But I think it could be much better once the renovation is completed
14024,4,This is one of a good places to visit during in Seoul especially for the aquamarine lovers This is definitely a cool place with the very nice decorations but a bit expensive But overall its such a lovely place to visit either with family partner or friends
14025,5,This place located within the Coex Center is one of the mustsees in Seoul They have a vast variety of species exhibited They provide interactive activities for children It is amazing how clean and maintained the aquariums are
14026,2,This aquarium caters to families with small children If this isnt you go elsewhere If it is you you and your children will have a very nice time
14027,5,Coex Aquarium is a combination of Marine Fish  Brackish Water fishes in the Amazon jungle It highlights fishes in their natural habitats able to live together with other kinds For the marine fishes theres a section where children are allowed to handle live corals starfishes hernit crabs  even a baby octopus There is also a tank full of Piranhas looking so aggressive  unfriendly It usually takes about 90 mins to complete everything Coming out of the Aquarium you will be able to buy souvenirs to bring homeHighlight is the feeding times when 4 divers get into the water to hand feed the fishes octopus sting ray  mantle ray They also performed some water aerobics to entertain the audience in the theatre
14028,4,Coex Aquarium is fun and interesting especially for young kids My daughter is 310 years old thus still free; payment starts at 4 if I am not mistaken The map at the start of the journey makes going around more interesting as one needs to complete the stamp from several stops and get a post card after There are a lot of variety of sea creatures and they eat healthy foods fruits and veggies A nice place to visit and takes around 12 hours in total 
14029,4,Aquarium is in the Coex Mall Great use of mirrors makes it look much bigger than it is Some clever displays such as panels in drink vending machines in old phone boxes household items for smaller fish I spent 25hrs there and enjoyed it Good variety of fish and animals such as otters prairie dogs bats and squirrels Sharks are a decent size as are the rays The manatees were my favorite though Compared to other aquariums this is overpriced It cost 2500 won to enter A nice way to spend a few hrs  Accessible from the green line Sameosung station
14030,5,Some people might balk at the price but its worth it if you go as a group Its a very nice aquarium with plenty of English information for visitors We went as a school trip for students who were mostly English speakers and they really enjoyed it
14031,3,The place is overrun with children and definitely geared towards them in my opinion We were 3 adults and we of course still enjoyed all the sea life but we did not enjoy the crowds I would avoid weekends if possible
14032,4,Enough to see when you want to get out of the cold There are good signage to each exhibit Before the entrance and inside there are lockers for storing your bags
14033,4,This is a standard aquarium in that there are lots of tanks of fish However they had one room laid out with tanks showing what would be from the beginning of the Han river to the sea It also has what lives in a paddy field There are unusual fish tanks one uses a refrigerator  There were also otters beers and manatees
14034,4,Good aquarium Entrance fee is 25000 KRW Great location in Gangnam The one in Busan is probably better
14035,5,This aquarium started out hohumthen got interesting I especially liked the Dr Fish that nibbled my fingers My kids especially liked the touchandfeel section as well as the microscopes that magnified tiny aquatic creatures Im happy we went Just outside a metro stop  super easy to access Part of an underground mall so plenty of dining and coffee options for before or after
14036,4,This a nice aquarium in the middle of the city and about five minutes from the nearest subway stop However it is far too crowded making it difficult to view the exhibits in a relaxing manner The exhibits are modern and professional
14037,3,We visited the aquarium due to the bad outdoor weather and we have a couple of hours to kill This aquarium is like any other aquarium plenty of tropical species of fish sharks rays etc The layout of the place is more or less similar to other public aquariums with a tunnel to view the ocean creatures I have been to better ones in my opinion A good place to visit if you have time to kill and you have a restless child in tow Skip this attraction if you have other places to visit
14038,4,I didnt expect a huge Aquarium inside a mall It looked small when viewed from the entrance but youll be surprised how bit it actually is It had different themes and a good variation of fish and other animals
14039,4,We visited the aquarium at the CoEx Mall one evening before closing It was over 20 for admission A little more than expected We enjoyed our hour going through all the various exhibits They even had a beaver exhibit with all the different aquatic animal and fish exhibits There are vary many exhibits and the interesting thing about them is the design of the tanks For example in one area there were fish swimming in a kitchen sink Also there is a tank where you can put your fingers in and the fish will nibble off your dead skin cells They didnt seem to interested that evening Overall we enjoyed the time we spent here
14040,4,This aquarium leaves a lot to be desired for a city of this size In my opinion Busan is a much better aquarium The majority of the exhibit is comprised of indigenous fresh water fish however they do have a nice selection of sharks one of which ate another shark in 2015 and can be seen on CNN online
14041,4,The aquarium was entertaining for the kids Had a good selection of fish and animals from all over Korea as well as a select few from around the world  There is a section where they have fish in interesting tanks like vending machines phone booths refrigerators etc that were pretty neat  Kids enjoyed the interactive touch exhibits and the sharks and rays
14042,2,Its not that its bad but dont waste your time in Seoul on this attraction If you are travelling with children it will be a nice thing to do but dont expect something special
14043,5,The aquarium presents a large and rare variety The whole arrangement is with due consideration of children The informative boards are in simple but catchy language to attract the kids And really the kids enjoy it very much It has a high educative value and is a must visit place for children
14044,4,Their aquarium is pretty huge with huge sea animals too Great for kids And nice place to take picture
14045,3,We finished seeing everything in less than an hour Its a very small aquarium and not really worth going to Youre better off just exploring Coex Mall itself
14046,1,You cant simply put random fish in random containers and call it an aquarium  I really wanted to like this place but this place is way too scattered and sparse in its exhibit to be a first class aquarium
14047,4,I found that it is one of the great aquarium probably the best one in Korea I didnt expect that much just thought it would be normal one But it was really nice and I did like it A lot kind of fishes and etc The best part was the glass tunnel there I felt like I was under the real sea
14048,5,I sow new and wearied kind of fish there The most amazing view was the shark view And they were playing music and they put cheers at the back so you can watch it comfortably as long as you want                      
14049,4,Visited the Aquarium with a 3 year old and a 7 year old The Aquarium isnt as grand and spectacular as some other Aquariums in Asia but considering it is right in the city and above a mall it is not too bad There are some fun exhibits for children Some quite interactive keeping young children busy Visit for the entertainment aspect of it and yoi wont be disappointed Expect to spend about 15 to 2 hours
14050,3,This Aquarium has some Limited Species of Fishes it is Not that Attractive and a bit Pricey on the Entry FeeIt might Excite the Kids to see some Fishes but not worth the Entry fee
14051,2,I have been to plenty of aquariums over the world The one in COEX mall was priced 15000 won back in 2012 and showed nothing much for the entrance fee I found only the jelly fish section better than the rest Entirely forgettable experience
14052,4,I spent about 35 minutes total looking through the aquarium I think the price reflects the fact that the aquarium is in the middle of a city
14053,3,Not as big and impressive as other aquariums in the world you can spend some pleasant times to visit
14054,5,We were there in Aug My 11 year old had a blast You can touch certain fishstarfish and snails Is not thay big but bigger than you would imagine since it is inside the mall They have shows and overall a good experience
14055,4,My four year old and I love going to COEX aquarium One can easily spend about 34 hours in the aquarium Its not just viewing the lovely displays but also the shows like feeding the Sharks penguin You can touch and feel starfish which is fun I love the display which has the fish that eats your dead skin There is a innovative section where they have aquariums made with stuff like refrigerator vending machine etc definitely worth a trip
14056,5,I loved this aquarium It was lovely with many species of fishes  huge sharks Its not over crowded  also pretty diverse with other animals other than fishes
14057,5,A wonderful place and is located in the center of shops and underground and has many fish and marine life and possible buy toys on the forms of fish
14058,5,I went with a friend and we both think it is really a nice and particular aquarium It is really unique and I think its a good place to spend a day for families with kids
14059,5,Family outing in COEX mall would never want to miss out the fun and educational aquarium Note the feeding timetable for various locations if you like to witness the real time feeding fun
14060,3,It is located inside the Coex mall but it is closer to the Bongeunsa station The aquarium is definitely geared more towards kids You can stick your hands in one of the tanks where they keep those small fish that munch on your dead skin The aquarium is not that big but they have penguins otters manatees sea turtles beavers sharks and rabbits  Its a nice place to chill on a hot summer day
14061,4,This aquarium starts off like any other aquarium but then you get to the area of tanks that are shaped like a telephone box or fire extinguisher same size a real one The are also some rabbits chipmunks prairie dogs and Guinea pigs It was quite crowded so it was difficult to see sometimes There is a touch pool with some cool things like the sea pineapple and sea slug There is only a small cafe which sells ice cream and a small selection of drinks inside the aquarium area but a lot of good places around Some quite pricey You can get line number nine right to the door on the subway Get off at Bongeusa station This station wasnt on the map I picked up so I guess my map is old As i didnt know about this station we caught line 7 to Cheongdam and walked down past the temple
14062,5,We were very impressed with this attraction overall Great care and planning fun design elements and a variety of animals including native species youd be unlikely to encounter made for an informative and entertaining experience As a pair of adults no kids wed recommend 15  2 hours for a leisurely encounter With kids perhaps adjust time expectations This being Korea great selfie opportunities abound and the tanks also lent themselves for some great pix and video to share w friends  A tip for couples we went late in the day on a weekday  that cut down on the kidtraffic making the trip through a peaceful and soothing chance to unwind
14063,5,Very nice aquarium with a wide variety of animals I will post more photos later Lots of interactive things for children to do to make learning fun The mall was HUGE So many stores and places to shop and eat Really good day but wear your walking shoes
14064,5,great aquarium and its at the mall one of the few places with manatees and you can see them up closeone part even has weird fish tanks like kitchen sinkstelephone boothswashing machines etcplanning on going back
14065,5,This is a great place when you are traveling with kids and they have gotten tired of watching temples castles markets and other stuff their parents want to see The aquarium is large with a large variety of fishanimals and good english translations There is an interesting section on the fish in the Seoul area Han river and a great kids section where they can touch some sea shell and fish  Combine the visit with some shopping in the Coex mall and you could easily spend a day here
14066,5,Very nice aquarium with interacting activities for the kids do like touching water creatures Cool designs with fish tanks Highly recommend this place if you come during the hot summer months After you are done you can walk around the mall which has very nice movie theater duty free shop and Hyundai Dept store at the other end of the COEX I personally like this place then Seaworld
14067,4,This aquarium is not up to the standards of Long Beach or Toronto but in a city thats a little short on activities for kids its not a bad place to spend an hour or so
14068,5,They offer Military Discounts You could spend the entire day walking around the aquarium Great for kids of all ages
14069,5,The aquarium has a wide variety of sea creatures It was a very open area for the large amount of visitors and was pretty clean I especially enjoyed how visitors could interact with some of the sea creatures doctor fish touching a starfish etc and learn about some of the common illnesses in fish by looking under a microscope The displays of the fish are also very creative; for example one fish tank looked like a telephone box and another looked like refrigerator
14070,5,Good aquarium to visit if you have not been to one  but if you have been to the one in some of the other places SingaporeThailandChina then you may not find it as special
14071,5,Beautiful aquarium It sure is a fun place for all family members to visit It has hands on experience with the fishes lots of fun
14072,4,For those who have time to spend pleasant I recommend visiting the aquarium Place abundant in fish sharks turtles The aquarium is huge and been in a amazing mall
14073,4,Looks like small  it indeed small  but with good interior and creative design surprisingly its very enjoyable Recommended
14074,3,A small scale aquarium in the COEX mall  There are many kind of fishes and sea creatures including seals and penguins Quite interestingly there are also some nonsea creatures for example monkey rabbitsetc  I spent a 2 hours happy time at the aquarium If you have extra time especially on a rainy day it is a good place to visit
14075,4,First I thought it was a small place but was surprised about how big it actually was They have some great things for kids they can touch some of the fish see how they lay eggs hatch and a special place with jellyfish Not only fish they have seals manatees penguins otters a croc turtles and a lot more than I would expect Though its in a mall the whole thing is quite big with a big tank and a glass tunnel Kids will love this place and so did I
14076,3,Had a lot of beautiful fish displays but also a fair amount of animals too like otters and beavers and Guinea pigs
14077,4,This aquarium in the mall dont have a lot of species of fish compare to ocean world But the price i think is much cheaperso for killing time 12 hours This place is okay to visit Fresh water have arapaima red tail catfish sturgeon salt water is shark manta and no whale here
14078,5,Its just awesome kids like it so much and dont want to leave Every part of it is so attractive with different theme be prepared to spend hours to experience it I cant wait to be back
14079,5,The COex aquarium has been designed to entertain all age groups The money is worth spending it takes 3 hours at least to cover As compared to Dubai Singapore and London I found this to be bigger and more number of fish types
14080,3,This is a ok aquarium but there are some things that let it down Some of the tanks are a little small but this is due to the fact that it is in a mall Despite this its still a nice way to spend the day  For Conan OBrien fans they have Samuel the Octopus on display toward the end of the aquarium They also have an exhibit of more unusual fish tanks with fish inhabiting such things as sinks fridges and phone booths  This would be a good place to bring children Theres an aquarium passport that children can pick up and stamp along their way through the aquarium  All in all a decent enough aquarium but certainly not the best one Ive been to
14081,5,The first part is mostly local freshwater fish Dont spend too much time there if you want to see the sharks and octopithere are lots of those later
14082,4,Loved the aquarium it starts with little tanks than gets bigger and better as it progresses  there are alot if things to see you can do this and explore within 2 hours
14083,5,At first glance i thought an aquarium in the middle of a mall but i was very pleased It had a lot of great aquatic creatures and was a good way to spend an hour
14084,3,The highlight was the cool little water ballet routine by the food court the divers joining in making the kids laugh and when the sea life were being fed There were interesting fish tanks made out of old appliances sinks vending machines ect
14085,5,Went here with my boyfriend Its very interesting First they start of with small aquariums but the further in you go the bigger it gets The sharks was very interesting to see
14086,2,There isnt much you can really expect from an aquarium in a mall but its disappointing to see the conditions the sea mammals and birds are living in The fish seemed fine but the poor dugongs covered in layers of muck and so listless This place is great for kids but Im grateful my daughter is too young to understand how bad the conditions were for the sea mammals
14087,5,Very interesting place We have really enjoyed A lot of fantasy a lot of imaginationWe would like to have English guide
14088,5,Being grown up in a coastl city I had my fair share of visits to aquarium in India but Coex Aquarium beats it by far and large Never ever miss visiting this place in your todo list You get to see a large variety of aquatic species and you can also touch few of them What more you get a free manicure inside  That is you are allowed to dip your hands in the aquarium of doctor fish which eat away the dead cells of your skin For those who are inquisitive and daring enough to touch will get a chance to touch the octopus You can see a wide range of jellyfish Ocean kingdom beats all with its collection of sharks large fish seals turtles and what not And penguins add more charm to the place  What you must observe is not just the species but the aquarium as well You must give accolades to them for their creativity Ever imagined that your front load washing machine can be an aquarium Or a bed lamp or a dressing table or a refrigerator or a public telephone booth for that matter No Well then you will get to see them all and much more in Coex Aquarium
14089,5,Outstanding aqua life great how it set out and you can watch divers do there thing with a shark great family day out
14090,5,We went on a weekday so the crowds were minimal its a lovely acquarium and the kids loved it Would recommend it to families with young children
14091,4,Many weird and abnormal aquarium tanks together with normal ones Plenty of different fish to see and enjoy Recommended
14092,5,When we arrived lical people told us there are 2 whales living in the aauarium  It sounded very strange but we said its worth check it out  Well no whales of course But its really beutiful aquarium filled with all the fishes you can think of  Really recommended for anyone  And there are instructions in english as well
14093,2,it was so crowd i could not see half of fishes and great number of kid less then one year oldscreaming crying those who could running parents brining baby cares of course the baby cares are very helpful in crowd you can push with it all people around it is painful tho think how all oh those creatures exist in that hell all their life show which they announced wellgirls under the water making ege stupid face which pretend to be cute and strange moving with hands close to face and divers making heart shape with armsand all this hell going on in extremely crowd i would leave but just should stay because it was impossible what surprised me more then greediness is cruelty they scare those creatures who hiding from people from behind so they coming to the frontthen again scaring from all that screaming and shouting again hiding and again some scary sounds coming and and again they running in panic back to frontis it smart  is is what for you use your brain dear owners of Coex Aquarium
14094,5,I thought it was a bit pricey going in but then was impressed with the size of the aquarium especially for one that is inside a mall
14095,4,i went there and was totally empty it was only my family its good to give it a quick visit if you are in COEX complex
14096,4,Such a perfect place to spend a rainy day The aquarium was nice a little smaller than we are used to but still very nice Families with little children will enjoy it more than those with older Another benefit is that Hard Rock Cafe Seoul is right upstairs from the Aquarium
14097,4,Older and more accessible exhibits Loved learning about the jellyfish lifecycle The sardines were captivating Informative well designed and original Morning we went wasnt crowded at all
14098,4,This is a nice aquarium underground in the COEX mall Definitely good for little kids but also adults who love the marine life
14099,5,Coex Aquarium s located inside the coex mall In the beginning of the visit I though that was so bad experience but the visit along the way is getting better and better The high point is the sardines show A very nice place to take children
14100,4,We loved the exhibit but would have love it more if there was an english translation or subtitle on the show with the sardines Because it seem very nice and our kids would have been able to appreciate watching it more if they understood
14101,4,Went on a Sunday and it wasnt that busy Really wasnt expecting the aquarium to be this nice Had a lot of animals and gave a discount on parking Weekdays have more shows than weekends Really happy and it was well worth the price of admission
14102,5,This aquarium was a lot of fun Even though we werent coming here with kids it was a very enjoyable It took us about 2 12 hours to get through all of the exhibits but with kids I would plan more time We really enjoyed the exhibits with the fish in random object such as a coke machine and a fridge That exhibit also had rabbits and guinea pigs in a bathroom setting that was quite humorous It wasnt too crowded even though we went there the day after Christmas
14103,4,You must get the feel of this place Worth spending money on it You will get to see shark also It will pass over your hear It is just awesome
14104,5,One of the best aquariums Ive been to From the outside it looks like it is going to be a small aquarium but inside it is very well done A lot of time has been taken to decorate this aquarium Spent a lot of time walking around Would be great with little kids It is great for big kids too 
14105,5,The wife and I just so happen to be walking around the coex mall and saw signs for the aquarium so it peaked our interest Was not expecting so much It had a lot of different exhibits and provided places to make some great memories
14106,5,coex aquarium is indoor which is good that you plan to go here during bad weather foreigners who ride public transportation would past through sm town where you can buy plenty of band items there such as exo girls generation and so on coming back to coex aquarium the price is not bad because of the wide aquarium and types of fishes sharks and mammals you see there are also a few stops where you can touch the creatures which is a great experience for anyone at any age D thumbs up from mee 
14107,2,It is very clean and it is very polished But it is a private aquarium in the middle of a shopping mall It is very expensive for a family of four and not worth the price of admission
14108,2,inside a Huge mall you will need 20min to find it since its deep down the ticket is for 20Euros the tour can be done in 30min in the morning you will find School kids with there teachers it has a nice introduction to sea life
14109,4,This is located inside of the huge COEX mall Path to the aquarium is well marked Lots of fish from around the globe Big shark tank and they had a show with divers The grandkids enjoyed it
14110,4,The COEX Aquarium is a fantastic aquarium for the price point It starts off slow with really small fish and sea creatures but eventually opens up to larger tanks and fish I would say this COEX Aquarium is almost as good as the Jeju Aquarium but its half the price
14111,3,On a work trip so decided to drop by the shows were average and was hoping to see a bigger tank I was comparing to my experience in Osaka and Singapore aquariums Entrance fee is 22000 won that said they made the whole experience very convenient with multiple lockers clear signs interaction with sea creatures etc it was just smaller than expected
14112,2,I enjoyed the aquarium greatly and the animals were interesting and you can get really close to them The reason for the two star rating is because the aquarium is way overpriced its almost 30 just to see animals like penguins and turtles so it really wasnt worth the time yes it was beautiful and I enjoyed it too but save your money there are better places in Seoul 
14113,5,This is very good for children  It is underground So you can have a plan under bad weather conditions  There is beautiful Budhist Temple Bongjeongsa Temple where the Monk Exam was held Actually Aquarium is the very place of Exam  
14114,2,The Coex Aquarium is small and had a stale fish smell starting from main entrance Not much fish to see but many parents brought their children there to watch the fishes
14115,2,COEX was supposed to be a big center considering the reviews I have read Well it is not Small shopping mall and unimpressive Aquarium There is a Budhist temple just in front of it that is much more interesting
14116,4,Very easy to find it is within the Coex complex It displayes some rare and not so rare fish and the best ones are the Sharks so close to the visitors
14117,3,If you will visit Coex Mall you have to go to Coex aquanrium i can be having fun with lover or children
14118,5,The COEX Aquarium is located at the Coex Shopping Centre where you would never expect to find an aquarium The displays and fish are very nicely presented One of the best Aquariums I have been to
14119,5,Located in the Coex Mall this aquarium is entirely underground When we started out I was thinking it looked like a fish store which didnt make me happy However as we moved on this turned out to be a most wonderful aquarium it matches any worldwide large aquarium easily I really enjoyed this
14120,5,as expected it will give you joy and entertainment in a calm manner the usual aquariums but different design approach
14121,4,If you get tired of shopping check out the aquarium I was pleasantly surprised by how big it is It took me about 2 hours on my own It might take longer with children There are a number of fun exhibits including one where they turned everyday objects into fish tanks They made a refrigerator washing machine and phone booth into tanks They are really cool The aquarium has manatees sharks seals and more
14122,2,I read some reviews about it and I had high expectations about it but unfortunately when I went there i found it normal  nothing special about it and it is even less than normal
14123,3,Visited the Aquarium to kill time It is more suitable for young children than grown ups Had a good display of different species of fish though The live Penguin feeding was interesting
14124,5,I have seen a lot of aquariums and this was definitely one of the best Not only is it informative but its also entrain img as they try to put their own twist on it You can even touch some fish there Would recommend about 23 hours but I could easily have spent all day there If I ever go back to South Korea again I will definitely be going there
14125,4,Its nice place but dont expect to see something special Its more for kids than adults However you should see it when you visit Coex Mall
14126,4,it was my second visit love the place clean lots of things to see a bit different with my first visit
14127,3,A small aquarium in the shopping mall Gangnam Can try to put your hands in the water tub which is full of small fish to nibble away dead skin on your fingers The best part is at the end of the aquarium therefore if not much to tour around then move faster to see the most instresting views at the end of the route
14128,4,A lot larger than I expected Great collection of fish and a nice break from wandering the cavernous mall and losing money at the casino slots only
14129,4,I am a huge fan of aquariums so I enjoyed COEX aquarium Fish of all kinds is a feast for eyes COEX also has otters and parrots inside The only drawback is price Its a bit expensive comparing to what the aquarium offers
14130,3,Its a bit expensive but generally was okay Lots of different fishes We even managed to get into mermaid show
14131,3,There are some nice displays but the huge tank at the end was really the best part with its large fish turtles and sharks There SHOW consisted of the large tank feeding It was very crowded and had many children but might be different during the week There are wheelchairs if you need to use one
14132,3,Visited the COEX Aquarium after a visit to Bongeunsa Temple Not a really big aquarium tanks are mostly small However i enjoyed their petting zoo whereby we were allowed to get up close to sea creatures Overall an average experience for I have seen bigger Aquariums
14133,2,Its in the Coex mall and its pretty much like every other small aquarium youve ever gone to If you absolutely have nothing better to do go ahead and spend 20000krw Frankly Id rather walk around the mall I hate malls see a movie and have a bite to eat
14134,4,I was here few times And always enjoy my visiting They had a very wide range of animals and the exhibits are very well maintained It takes about 2 hours to look through all the exhibits
14135,3,After 5 years in Korea I finally gave in an went to Coex Aquarium with my boyfriends sister and nieces In all honesty Ive never been a fan of aquariums but this one is nothing special Its crowded the tanks are too small for many of the larger fishmammals and most people are more interested in taking photos of themselves at the aquarium that actually looking at anything There are other better sites to see in Seoul and Korea that are cheaper and a far better use of time
14136,5,Awesome is the word This place should be in the must go place in your trip The coex mall in itself is very large and you cannot even imagine so big aquarium inside the mall  They have created an environment where fish can be found everywhere In refrigerator washing machine phone booths etc etc They have large varieties of fish available There is also a show inside which is also very good  Overall you will find a day very well utilized in Seoul  
14137,5,They say that this is the second largest in Asia So beautiful the entire tour will take an hour but it is must visit and every penny value The kids will love it Staff very efficient
14138,5,So this place is actually in the Coex Mall I spent a couple hours here checking out the fish and little wild life they had There were so many fish and some of the designs for the aquariums holding the fish were interestingone set of fish live in a little place that makes music by the movement of the fish Another set of fish lived in a sink another set in a refridgerator They also have a set of doctor fish but the ones from Turkey not from China Im not sure why that was important but there is a plaque next to the wall stating this info There is also an area for penguins and seals and manitees The seals were so fun because they kept playing with me through the glass I would recommend this place for all ages
14139,4,Coex aquarium is definitely worth a visit if you have some spare time The aquarium is well set outthe displays are very well done and it was good to see them feeding the fish Being in a large shopping mall there is many places where you can get something to eat and do some window shopping after you have been through the aquarium Look for the Hyundai shopping centre if you are into food The presentation is something special however check the prices before you buy Get the subway back A day well spent
14140,3,I like to visit Aquariums when I travel and this is a nice one but it is really geared for small children
14141,5,Coex Aquarium is huge aquarium and has a lot of different kinds of sea animals Sharks are the main icon of the aquarium The restaurant Deep Blue will offer great experience to you
14142,4,I thought it will just be another aquarium but it is nice Aquarium in the city and they display many modernized aquarium setting Worth going for a different aquarium experience
14143,3,I saw so many school kids enjoying their visit but to me it was not the best choice however I recorded some movies to show to my little daughter
14144,5,This is one of the best aquariums I have been to They had a very wide range of animals and the exhibits are very well maintained like everything else we had visited in Seoul May seem a little pricey but very in line with what everything else in Seoul costs Our boys  4 7 11  had a such a great time and couldnt stop talking about how much fun it was The 11 year old said it was so much better than he expected We stayed about 2 hours which was enough time to see all the exhibits and get out of the heat It was a little busy but was assuming that it is end of summer trips for many
14145,2,I really advice you not to waste your time as you have alternatives Yes it is a good place to visit but seoul is a full city with many thing better than this place
14146,5,I think people are being a little too harsh on this place  In regards to what others have said too expensive or not worth the price for the size and Ive been to better  My thoughts on these comments  too expensive and not worth the price for the size Its 22000 won for an adult which is about 22 Thats a few dollars cheaper than the other aquariums Ive been to So with that being said I dont think it was too expensive I also have to say that it felt a lot bigger maybe even double the size of the aquariums Ive been to Aquarium by the Bay in San Francisco and Sea Life at the Mall of America So I have to say that its worth the price for the size  Ive been to better I have to say this tops my list for aquariums It was mapped out perfectly and you flowed through the place It was more than just fish but mammals as well I doubt Ill ever go to another aquarium that has penguins seals sea otters manatees crocodiles etc all in one place Other highlights for me cool fish tank displays working Coke machine washing machine and Dr Fish
14147,4,The aquarium took about 2 hours Kids enjoyed the unconventional tanks We walked around Coex mall and then spent some time at the bookstore Its a great place to spend on a rainy day in Seoul
14148,5,I especially loved the interactive displays and the glass tunnel Many different types of sea creatures
14149,5,I love coex aquarium Located within a mall there was alot to do even after u left The aquarium itself is separated into different sections and now includes a touch and see section and where you can actually touch the fishes its actually more like the mussels and etc type stuff as well as dip your hands for the doctor fishes known to eat the dead skin off your handsfeet Theres also a science laboratory section where you can see the growth stages of the sea creatures Best thing is that they made it so that you can easily take photos without it reflecting light off your pictures Whole thing should take a bit over an hr Hope u enjoy
14150,2,Quite a standard aquarium experience In the middle there are some funny installations such as phone booth aquarium or fishes swimming inside a laundry machine A bit expensive compared to other major aquariums in Asia
14151,4,I really didnt want to go to the aquarium but my husband insisted we look at the fish so I went with him The price about 20 usd was a bit steep I thought but nonetheless we entered Never have I been so pleasantly surprised The place was well layed out with arrows pointing the direction so you didnt collide with other observers and just enough light to see but not so much that the place seemed artificial and gaudy Not only does the aquarium house fish but it also has turtles rabbits alligators beavers and prairie dogs In some cases I saw creatures in person that until then I had only seen on Animal Planet or the Discovery Channel I must say the Coex Aquarium is a wonderful attraction and a must see if you visit Seoul
14152,5,We had such a good day at the aquarium This is such an unexpectedly good attraction in the COEX mall It is one of the largest aquaria we have ever been to There are all sorts of animals that live in the water here not just fish such as beavers alligators penguins otters and huge turtles The entrance price is quite high but I think entirely worth it We did get a discount as we had bought something at one of the stores in the mall We spent around 2 12 hrs here If you time it right try and see some of the feeding times Penguins at 1530 We found the keepers very respectful of the animals too as they were observing a penguin
14153,2,We have been to many aquariums this one was nothing special in our opinion The cost to get in is not worth it For the price it needs to be 23 times larger Our preteens were bored We spent maybe 2 hours here And that was us TRYING to take our time and read everything to get our moneys worth
14154,4,Good to see some very cute looking fish tanks Not an enormous aquarium but big enough for me to walk around and relax looking at the fishes swim
14155,4,Not cheap but worth the price Had a blast with a family of friends We went on Tuesday and we got lucky because it wasnt crowded and we could appreciate the all the cool upgrades
14156,4,My family stayed at the Intercontinental Coex and walked along the corridors to the subway often We passed the Coex Aquarium frequently and made a point to visit before our trip to Seoul was complete  This is a pretty big aquarium I think its bigger than the 63 Sea World we liked it even better than 63 Sea World There were lots of fish sharks rays seals jelly fish penguins and a touch pool area  There was an area geared towards kids but it was a little bit run down when we visited and not all the exhibits worked We were a little disappointed but aside from that everything was well maintained and the homes of the creatures looked clean and cared for There were many many tanks to see animals in They boast 3000 tons of water with 650 species and 40000 living things  The place is open 10am to 8pm every day of the year Even when they are closed they have a couple beautiful tanks outside filled with color fish to entice you to return when they are open  They have an overpriced cafe and a souvenir shop They are a little on the expensive side at about 19 for adults and 14 for kids We saw the entire place in about an hour  Our favorite parts included the Japanese garden type area with a huge koi pond the photo op type things you stick your head through that they had a chipmunk at an aquarium the seahorses the penguins and the jellyfish
14157,5,I visited the COEX Aquarium today and I really enjoyed it The themes are good with ample species of fish and wildlife It is the first time I saw penguins and beavers in captivity It was also the first time I saw a living corral The show was also good and it did not involve petting animals Overall a good two hours well spent
14158,4,I was under the impression this place was going to be a really cruel place with no room for the animals to move but I was pleasantly surprised The rabbits yes they have rabbits had heaps of room Most fish tanks were relatively full for the smaller fish but nothing horrendous The tanks for the larger animals such as sharks stingray manatee etc were huge and they had heaps of room The only cage that I didnt like was for the monkey  he needed more room Otherwise the place in general was very exciting and fun  even for older people The doctor fish that eat dead skin cells off your hands and the Sharks were definitely my highlight In my opinion overall worth the money and recommend
14159,4,We thought the COEX Aquarium looked modern and was imaginatively laid out To us it was better than most not as good as some others It had enough of interest to keep us occupied for a little over an hour It is located in a large shopping centre
14160,1,50 fish to one small tank The place is busy and the fish are in tiny tanks I love Korea but I dont like the zoos etc over there
14161,5,This aquarium is in the Coex Mall I thought its a small one with exhibition of just some fish according to the map given Yet the route shown on the map is not in proportion or ratio in any sense My 7yrold enjoyed strolling around a lot There are some shallow tanks where you can touch different species too
14162,1,My friends and I were visiting Seoul for just 2 days we decided to take a city tour that included the Codex Aquarium My friends enjoy diving and marine anything The building that houses the Aquarium is a marvel There are shops and restaurants and meeting places for large events A huge facility The entry to the exhibit space is colorful and welcoming And then it happens You see large tanks of huge fish so full of fish that it looks like one of those choose your own fish for supper places Sadly it gets worse because they also have marine mammals otters etc and they have no room to swim little tiny bits of water in the very front of the case no privacy areas They have Bats where they cannot fly They have Manatees just in a tank no environment and with 3 beasts no room to really move and nowhere to move to Really really sad The whole thing is just heart breaking Kids who dont know any better will love it But their parents who should know better should not take them there and support this cruel treatment
14163,4,I thought an aquarium inside a mall would be an oversized pet store with some fish In reality this aquarium is large and has a lot of exhibits Marine mammals birds a wide array of fish The displays are good Entry price is about 20
14164,4,That title is actually true seriously check it out  Anyway this place has everything from penguins to dolphins fantastic shows and feed i recommend getting there earlier so you can follow the feeding and enjoy the shows so much to see that you certainly wont be bored everything from the colourful to the fantastic
14165,4,Great place spent hours in here on numerous visits Interesting and creative displays and so many different tanks and exhibits Well maintained and great fun
14166,5,I have visited aquariums in Indonesia Bangkok Osaka and Tokyo But from my point of view this one is the best  The place is huge well maintained clean and consist of thousand varieties of sea creatures  We spent almost 4 hours inside and my kids love this place very much  A very worth visit
14167,5,I had never been to an aquarium before I thought its gonna be boring But this place is amazing and I loved the variety they have and amazing experience indeed
14168,5,We really enjoyed spending some unique time in this special place Many species of fishes and a lot of more than that Sharks were the nicest part for me I think that the price was a little higher but it is strongly recommended
14169,4,Yes it is an aquarium in a shopping mall but surprisingly well done clean wellorganized welllabeled sufficient English signage and labels welllit The animals all appear to be wellcaredfor and displayed in suitable educational settings That said there are also humorous and creative goldfish tanks in washing machines and other unexpected setups I would call this a mustsee stop for kids and aquarium aficionados We saw the sardinedancing show which was clearly for the kids  scuba divers in royal robes  but still entertaining We went on a holiday so it was really crowded though still manageable It is not cheap but not outrageous for 3 good hours of educational entertainment If you live in the area buy an annual pass to bypass the ticket queue I mean you can go shopping go to a movie and drop by the shark tank What more could you ask for
14170,4,For an aquarium in a mall it had an impressive variety of fish Many small tropical to even large shark tank Location was very convenient with large number of restaurants in mall Easy access to subway
14171,4,This is a really nice aquarium with many more amazing fish sharks and sea creatures than I expected We really enjoyed it especially the large exhibits with turtles sharks and sting rays Somewhat pricey but not exorbitant
14172,4,My kids both 12 and 10 years old both loved this Coex Aquarium they had seen here several sea animals that they have never seen before Very educational and very clean I especially love how they design the aquarium of the sea animals very creative Love this aquarium
14173,4,This is not Sea World but it is the nicest aquarium in Seoul  plenty of interesting exhibits and it can get a little crowded at times in some of the narrower spaces Very interesting fish exhibits from around the world with some mammals penguins manatees otters etc and amphibians mixed in Plan to time your visit around some of the live feeding shows  the staff put on an entertaining underwater show in their wet suits and costumes The aquarium is located on the lower level of the mall so there are plenty of dining options right nearby Best to go during the week when things are a bit less crowded  the entry fee was not exorbitant about 20 US for adults a bit less for teens and younger children You can easily spend 3 hours strolling and viewing the exhibits
14174,4,The COEX Aquarium in Gangnam district Seoul is one of South Koreas largest Aquariums with over 40000 creatures from over 650 species on display The COEX Aquarium features 90 exhibition tanks grouped in fourteen discovery zones including six themed areas The aquarium is housed within the COEX mall I particularly loved Wonderland  the home of unusual fish tanks in the form of toilet bowls telephone booth yes the big red telephone booth and imagine it with fish insideWonderland brings together a crazy collection of eccentric fish tanks The showercubicle tank is home to a yellowbearded dragon fish and there is a seahorse living in a computer monitor Put your hand in the bathtub and you will be tickled by doctor fish from the river basins of Turkey The Seven Seas features a kaleidoscope of tropical fish while Ocean Kingdom is home to dozens of sharks rays and huge schools of fish creating a real sense of life in the deep seas We stayed for quite a while in Ocean Kingdown admiring the sharks 
14175,4,Coex Aquarium is inside Coex Mall Coex Mall is connected to the subway  easily accessible However this mall is a high end mall  we did not really shop there
14176,4,Lots of beautiful creatures in relatively good sized aquariums Some creatures in cagesaquariums that were far too small The information boards for the majority were easy to translate into common english The exhibitions were interesting We had 3 hours to look around and found it not quite enough time
14177,4,We went here last weekend with a 14 year only and a four year old If you have little ones dont go on the weekend unless you want to carry them the whole time so they can see It was extreamly crowded and backpacks and purses were knocking my little guy constantly There is free stroller parking and lockers for 10002000 won It cost around 70000 won for our family We enjoyed it The sea lions and manatees were great especially at feeding time There was a diver and fish show that was cool too They have an exhibit area that had a variety of artistic shapes aquariums The pufferfish shark and seahorses were great There was an electric eel display and plenty on cool river fish Many of the fish names were labeled in English but the descriptions were all in Hungul Overall a fun way to spend a few hours I would go back on a weekday Tip bring your lic Plate number and type it into the kiosk at the entrance for discounted parking There are English signs in the parking garage for the aquarium The CoEx mall also has lots of food choices a theater and a giant 2 story slide
14178,4,The Coex aquarium is located inside the Coex Mall on the lower level It is open till 8pm Since it is in the mall you can enjoy many of the restaurants inside the mall Entrance for adults is 22000 won
14179,4,I really enjoyed the Coex aquarium Visitors are directed through the museum along a prescribed path with each room or area promoting some different theme There were fish that I had never seen before and some especially interesting creatures the manatee exhibit was very cool There were a few displayspens that I found a bit disturbing due to the size I found the monkey beaver and crocodile exhibits to be far too small On the whole however I though it was great and would definitely recommend it
14180,4,When you see the Aquarium from inside COEX Mall its deceiving It seems like it would be a very small aquarium But once youre inside it keeps going and going with pleasant surprises I especially liked seeing the sharks through the clear glass tunnel I also enjoyed seeing the penguins jump in and out of the water There are two downsides to this aquarium Its very crowded on Saturday afternoons which should come as no surprise Youll be bombarded with kids and some parents that might bump into you with their strollers Also the prices are a bit steep 22000 won for adults 19000 for middlehigh school students and 16500 for senior citizens But if youre patient youll be able to enjoy a nice experience
14181,4,Me and the Mrs missed this place on our last journey but we finally made it on time We enjoyed this one more than the Building 63s Aqaurium The animals here seemed more alivewell there was one beaver that seemed sickly I think we stopped and took photos at every area What was awesome were the dipping dot ice cream I havent had those in forever My wife loved them as well We did the one time purchase vs the annual membershipnot sure why anyone woukd do a annual membership to an aquarium but each their own Take your children herethey will have a blast
14182,3,The aquarium was well maintained I went during the day on Thursday so there were not many other people visiting but several preschool classes Children will enjoy this most but adults can still appreciate all the different species of fish and amazing colors of saltwater fish I have been to other aquariums so this did not excite me a whole lot but my mother had never seen anything like this and was amazed One interesting aspect was the tunnel that you can walk through it is as if you are in Biblical times when the Red Sea was parted That was the most interesting part and best viewing area
14183,4,My wife and I did this attraction towards the end of our trip and really enjoyed it its not far from the Buddhist Temple in Gangnam and is a great way to spend a couple of hours The price isnt too bad from memory and a lot of the fishes and other animals would not be seen in any other aquariams  Well worth the trip
14184,4,If you like aquariums youll like this one too Offers good views of the fish and loads of different kinds of fish Nice attraction for 23 hours
14185,5,The aquarium was different form the ones I have seen in the state the places were they keep their fish are very unique and everything seems very close you can almost touch them Nice trip if you are visiting with young children
14186,5,My favorite aquarium in USA is Montreal Bay Aquarium in California and this one comes close to it This aquarium is located under the Coex complex where all the major trading events are held With tons of shopping opportunities restaurants and movie theater within the complex it is a great place to spend a day especially when the weather is not good
14187,4,It offer good aquariums view and clean and also Kids love this but this facility is not that big place than I expected
14188,4,The aquarium in Seoul is great Located right in the middle of the city in the modern COEX mall it is easy to get to by subway walking or bus It is really nice  I went with my girlfriend on a weekend and it was crowded but the flow was good It is underground so it is really cool and well ventilated and I never felt like I was in a big crowd Everyone moved around and through the line really well and everyone was happy especially the kids  With so much to see it is laid out and designed very well Along with the most beautiful sea creatures that you will ever see there are extras like other animals and reptiles Lots of fun with a Disney like flair with little props and stages for the kids  There are drink machines all along the caves inside so you will not go thirsty and plenty of staff around to help at any time Perfect day for the family Going fast 1 hour Taking your time 3 hours Well worth the 22 admission price
14189,5,Nice place where you can easily spend an hour or even two Many children A little bit expensive but inside there are many unusual expositions like telephon box filled with fishes Actually i like everything in it  At friday in the morning about 11am there arent many people here
14190,4,I havnt been to so many aquariums since they mostly display the same things That beeing said I really liked this one Its fairly big and have many different kinds of fish and other animals living in water penguins seals and sea lions etc We spent some hours here There is a snacks area where you can buy hot dogs and drinks They also have a souvenier shop that was good
14191,1,Went there with 5 adult and 1 child 2year old on Saturday afternoon We just went there because we had a lunch reservation at coex intercontinental hotel and my mom wanted a place to spend some time with her grandchild after lunch Even though I wasnt looking too much forward I was disappointed It was really crowded and everybody was just walking in line to see rows of tiny view through a small window However just to give some ways of discount info its 22000krw for 1 adult but you can buy discount ticket for 3 or 4 from internet mall in advance and you can save approx 25 of the cost Children under 47months is free per 1 adult The annual pass is approx 23 times the 1 time entrance so if you plan to go more than 3 times definitely worth getting the annual pass although I would not get it myself If you have seen good aquarium you probably dont want to go there but no offence I really wish you have fun if you are going
14192,5,Not huge but very attractive They have many funny tanks like washer or harpshaped tank with electronic strings which are make sound when a fish cross it As for me the most amazing critters in Aquarium are manatees seal and beavers Manatees are look like huge sea cows who are pasturing under the water What else They have Electric eel hunting show I missed it but it has to be very interesting I watched one in other Aquarium and that is very unusual and cognitive Try to find the feeding schedule so you will have more fun  The touch zoo tank was filled with frozen cold water so it is almost not possible to touch and play with starfishes in there That is a great minus
14193,1,Its expensive Around 20000 won The space is small so it gets crowded very easily The animals were poorly kept The tanks werent clean It had an interesting smell I was really turned off by the venue There was one area that seemed to get more attention than all the others Its an open amazon kind of space That was the most interesting I will not go there again
14194,4,At first we thought it was pricey too just to see some fishes but behold You thought its small when you buy tickets and get to the entrance but every step that we took and we saw a lot more than different kinds of sea creatures They also have cute penguins monkeys and more animals inside You wouldnt believe there would be this sight just inside a mall
14195,4,I really liked this place 22000won per person may be a little pricey to some people but I did get to see many interesting marine animals The place is well planned out and clearly labelled I loved the thrasher shark although it wasnt labelled I hope I got the name right  However there were many people who seemed to not know how to behave in the aquarium Adults trying to lift tank covers tapping on tanks Children shouting flipping starfishes over at the petting pool picking starfishes up and out of the water despite signs specifically telling them not to  All of these are not faults of the aquarium but I think more staff need to be present to ensure that the welfare of the animals are taken care of The visitors who behave inappropriately need to be reminded that their actions are unacceptable
14196,4,Visited on a weekend so there was quite a large crowd Pretty worth it for the price especially when compared to where I come from as there was a large variety of fishes to be seen It was also inside a mall which made it pretty convenient to visit
14197,5,Originally I had visited COEX Mall for some shopping but little did I know that it was closed for renovation I was so devastated until I found out that it has an Aquarium inside Honestly an aquarium in a shopping mall I did not think much of it but went in anyway since I didnt want my visit to be an entire waste of time and man was I surprised I havent had so much fun in ages I felt like a little child again There was a fair number and variety of animals on show and we spent a good couple of hours in here unknowingly Definitely worth a visit
14198,4,It was kinda boring at first but it became more exciting as I walked further I saw various of marine life together in one trip from a tiny jellyfish to a huge shark and mantaray in different size of aquarium penguincatfishmanatee you name italmost everything can be find hereThe not so enjoyable part is it was too crowded with people especially kids and the price is quite expensive
14199,5,We went here one afternoon because we had run out of things to do I had wanted to go but it was a bit pricey so it wasnt high on the priority list when I was planning  So glad we went Its really well put together The animals are well cared for and the exhibits are really quirky Some English but not a lot so sometimes you might want to know more about an animal or one of their educational exhibits but the information just wasnt available  Its actually in a really classy shopping centre the COEX which we quite enjoyed walking through to get there
14200,5,I went to this place by myself because my buddies did not want to pay the expensive fees It was neat none the less Its more for the younger crowd and there isnt much in English But I was ok as I know fish and aquatic life fairly well Makke sure you have enough time
14201,1,Do NOT go to this aquarium I only went because I was visiting the temple across the street which was closed and I had an hour and a half I had to kill The aquarium charged 22 US dollars but it was SO bad that it should have cost 1 This is only if you have little kids with you as they would probably be the only ones to enjoy it as they wouldnt know any better It was by far the worst aquariumattraction that I have ever been to in my life It was so bad that I think I went through the whole place in about 10 minutes I have never written a poor review but going to another country and spending 22 on a worthless rip off should be warned to all travelers Again do NOT waste your money or your time
14202,4,Visited in March 2014 with my wife and son He was very excited But the entry fee was steep at 17 But it was ok The only complaints is the boards and the explanations could have been in English Not able to read the signs But worth visiting if going with kids Situated in the basement of COEX mall and convention center
14203,1,Quite possibly the worst ripoff in Seoul For 17 admission fee you get little value You get poor signage incoherent educational value questionable exhibits aquarium with a bathroom setting and no standout animal attractions  Save your money and check out the free seafood markets instead
14204,5,My boys really enjoyed this aquarium There are a lot of unique displays made of random items like aquariums made out of televisions or phone booths and the like Its quite large and has many interesting specimens We also got a kick out of the doctor fish where one can stick their hand in the tank and have the fish nibble off the dead skin Fun timesmore expensive than most of the other attractions we saw in Seoul but for our boys it was a nice break from all the history and culture
14205,5,Though not very very large it has all the stuff I want for an aquarium Really loved how it zones its sea creatures
14206,4,Pretty goodQuite a big aquarium which takes an hour to walk past all the exhibits at a reasonable pace My particular interest is Salt water Reef which it really was a bit short ofthe usual huge tanks with sharks and raysthe usual suspects Grey Nurse and reef sharks a decent Tiger a bit unusual in a tank Good seals and penguins a great Sea CowManateeDugong tank Quite a lot of freshwater stuff which was interesting but not my obsessionsome really interesting Amazon fish including the inevitable Piranha A handling pool for children with starfish and other harmless and durable sea animals Really quite a good experience and well suited to taking children for an hours entertainment For the Aquarist lots of interest but not coral reef specific which is fair enough Its not as if you are in Florida or Queensland
14207,2,There were an amazing number of people crammed into the place it was difficult to really see the fish and around feeding times the crush to the front was too much so we left very disappointed Clearly there is no such thing as too many paying customers
14208,3,For the ticket price we paid we had expected more But it is the usual aquarium with a selection of fish and sea creatures It is not that large and you can finish a walk around easily in half an hour Again nothing special
14209,3,I have been there twice Last time i went i made the big mistake to go when there was a kids school field trip to the aquarium Kids running and screaming everywhere kind of ruined the whole idea of going there The aquarium itself is kind of nice when you get a chance to stop and look at everything now its not the best but its not the worst i have seen You can actually learn something if you get a chance to read the captions but the displays So all in all it was fun the first time i went but the second time i had a headache Scope out beforehand to make sure that you can actually see the marine life
14210,4,Prior to our visit to Lotte world we head down to Coex Aquarium to see underwater sea aquarium It was a pleasant visit and lots of interesting fishes and alike including sharks octopus cute colourful and funny shape fishes There are lots of weird storage places where they place fishes in like refrigerator washing machine basin sink etc Kids love it and definitely worth visit at such pricing Around 15000 won plus minus per person 
14211,4,Coming from a region  Southeast Asia  which has awesome aquaria in the cities Singapore Bangkok Kuala Lumpur this one is really not that great in comparison Still good for a visit and entertaining enough
14212,5,I visited this place on last Sunday and trust me it is amazing You can see fishes everywhere like inside fridge washing machine and even inside commode There are a lot of variety of fishes available To go there you can take subway You should get down at Samseong Station Subway Line No 2 Exits no 5 and no 6 of Samseong Station are directly connected to the COEX Mall  About Aquarium  If you are visiting this palace you should take out atleast 23 hours of your busy scheduleEntry fee for Aquarium is 19500 KRW It is situated on large area  Following things you must do  Please check feeding program timing You will enjoy  Fantastic part of visit is underwater tunnel safari Below the shark  You can also see many varieties of jelly fishes Take a photograph of jelly fishes  Penguins activities  To Eat   There is some food is available outside Aquarium You can try that on your own risk It is good
14213,4,COEX isnt just all fish no they have a small jungle themed section with monkeys tropical plants and elsewhere there are some prairie dogs chucked in for good measure There are Beavers penguins dugong and chipmunks squirrels maybe OH And you will find fish in the fridge washing machine toilet bowl kitchen skin telephone booth and chilling with spider man This section of unique places to hold a fish is referred to as the Wonderland and yes COEX has thought of it all I did a blog post on this attraction its worth the visit but be mindful of long lines on busy days httprememberthefirstwordpresscom20121215coexaquariumseoulsouthkorea
14214,4,Spent an afternoon at the Coex aquarium Entry price is about US18 for adult While its not the biggest aquarium in the world it definitely has lots to see and offer The best exhibit were the underwater tunnel and jelly fish display The aquarium is located inside the Coex mall so if you get tired from shopping this would be a good place to relax
14215,5,If u r looking for a place to shoot some photos in aquarium this place is definately the one I took lots of photos wit friends there 
14216,4,It took us 1 hour to look around It also had animals as well as sea creatures It wasnt the greatest but a nice place
14217,3,It was part of a tour and I didnt need it really The aquarium is small compared to other world famous aquariums Great set up for kids and schools Great venue if you are vacationing with small kids
14218,5,Can honestly say this tops New York London Tokyo and Paris Excellent and well thought out The animals are in great condition and have tons of room
14219,4,it worth that money and you can spend a good time there there are different type of creatures with different type of aquarium
14220,4,Managed to do a 3 hour visit Been to other aquariums such as Underwater world and Resort Worlds SEA aquarium Personally I feel that it is well managed as it is well divided into different eco systems for fishes ie Amazon Ocean etc Place is clean and exhibits are plenty Downside of this is that the walk from the subway station is kinda far and confusing though the species of fish are available in English it can further improved by providing the description of species in English as well Overall still a nice place to visit
14221,3,It is an ok aquarium I am from the States  have been to so many that in comparison to others Ive been to its just ok I also think that they are a little high on the entrance fee but that could be because there are so many other great things to do in Korea that cost next to nothing if not free to do so it just seems high Either way I think its high considering what you get  I would not pay it again It was also very crowded the day we went  at a couple points it was so packed that you literally had to wait for the crowed to move so you could But my kids enjoyed it  thats what mattered  Let me say though that there are far far better things to do in Korea inside  outside that are awesome  way cheeper do those if your having to choose between this or something else Korea is such an amazing place that offers so much beauty all around  this is nothing special in my opinion because it doesnt give you a taste of the awesomeness that is Korea
14222,5,I really enjoyed the aquarium There were so many fish Each was divided into simulated habitats and sections such as the amazon upper  middle  lower freshwater river and ocean for example There were even other creatures like flying squirrels and touch pools for children and adults to examine The best was the underwater walkway where we could watch the sharks swimming around above our heads It was a fun trip
14223,5,Given how many mums like to visit this place its way too stingy on its lift facilities We had to carry our phil and teds with two kids sleeping in it up at least 30 steps so in our second trip we demanded that the girls who work there help us and they let us use the wheel chair only lift Otherwise a great way to spend 23 hours looking at fishes sharks and sting rays
14224,4,Visited during peak season and although busy did not feel crowded and all features were easy to see Its set out in geographical areas and whilst not massive the displays were plentiful varied and interesting My son loved the penguins and sharks and I watched the turtles and manatees for ages Seals Beavers and otters were delightful A fun family day out and the imaginative displays were great
14225,4,This was fun for my 6 year old son There was a surprising variety of sea creatures This is a must if you have kids and visiting Seoul Well worth the entrance fee The mall is also cool too There is a Buddhist temple close by and tombs that are interesting to see
14226,3,We went during Summer and korea is really HOT and humid during summer Also they dont on air conditions indoors or even if they do its at its minimal so it is really stuffy indoors we were sweating like pigs Anyway Coex was under some major reconstruction or something when we were there so most shops were sealed The aquarium was okay Youd see more river fishes squirrels and small fishes and sharks Id say go during the cooler seasons and dont expect too much about the aquarium
14227,5,We had no idea the COEX Aquarium would be so vast since it doesnt seem that large  It also had a lot of sea life we hadnt seen anywhere else  We thought the  20000 won admission price to be reasonable
14228,4,My husband and I visited the aquarium on a Saturday afternoon and were surprised to find that the aquarium was by no means crowded The price of admission was a bit high 19500 won per adult but they had a good variety of things to see displayed in a nice way Even as two adults we easily spent over an hour and a half walking through it They had a couple places where you could touch different sea creatures that looked fun for the kids Im not sure Id pay the full price to go back again but its a nice outing if youre looking for something fun to do inside for a couple hours
14229,4,If you are reading this review trying to decide to go to the COEX Aquarium or not GO We drove from Yongsan to the COEX Mall Aquarium on a Saturday Although parking at COEX was crowded the odd thing was when we left the parking garage was almost empty For a family of four two adults an 8 year and a 3 year old we paid 54000 won not even a fraction of what you would paid at the AtlantaGeorgia Aquarium We had a blast This aquarium comes has everything you are looking for in an aquarium including vending machines a snack bar and a gift shop at the end Heres a tip  vending machines only take 1000 won not 5000 or higher We really enjoyed taking our time and enjoying all the exhibits I read previous reviews and thought it would be a small aquarium but we spent 2 123 hours inside Highlights  underwater walk thru tunnel the penguins feeding and the open fish ponds We will definitely visit this aquarium again
14230,4,The aquarium itself is not that big At first we didnt actually expect much from it except that we had to do it because we had some kids with us They have different themes like rainforest etc which is usual with most aquariums but they have a section where they use creative ideas to present the aquariums unlike the usual glass ones which we really find entertaining and funny They also have a section just for toddlers and features like fish spa We spent about 30 minutes inside and overall the kids enjoyed it
14231,5,I am a regular aquarium attendee all over the world so went long to the COEX Aquarium when I was feeling a bit down about how odd Seoul is for a westerner my problem not Seouls It cheered me up immensely I totally loved all the quirky touches The displays were clever and gorgeous It was quite busy but it didnt seem so with lots of contemplative spaces Most of the labels had English translations but a few were missed Please fix Wonderful aquarium  well done
14232,5,It is one of interesting way to create aquarium I have ever seen Price could be but lower but overall is OK As practically everyplace in Seoul here as well there are lot of things to do for children For me as for adult was interesting to found how interesting could be different view if Aquarium  like in the lamp fridge etc Enjoyed wildlife animals as well There are interesting shows as well
14233,3,there was no crowds when we visit at most like 20 visitor to the whole place So we had moment of peace seating down at one of the section watching the fishes swim in a relaxing mode Could drop by if around the area or anyone who love the underwater world
14234,4,The COEX Aquarium is in direct competition with the 63 Building Aquarium However its newer and bigger I think so most people flock to the COEX The entrance starts with some freshwater fish and reptiles and then the piecederesistance is the large aquarium with sharks and sea tortoises during feeding time when you get to see a diver go in and feed the fish  The downside is that during peak times it can get crowded to the point that you can barely move let alone see the fish The area gets very congested and stuffy so I would advise going during offpeak hours Offpeak hours I have found are right after the open and about two hours before closing  Also make sure to get your parking discounted
14235,5,There are many many varieties of fishes and other sea animals Also has sharks sting rays giant turtles Best part is the Aqua Tunnel at the end It also has some good places to get pictures taken Overall a very nice place to visit
14236,5,good if u have an interest in biodiversity sharks are the real attractionsituated in Coex mall Will take 2 hours minimum 19500 fees
14237,5,Its the only place where I saw manatees They are huge and funny You can watch them majestically swimming by or mouthwatering crunching on the cabbage You will see different sharks big octopus fur seals and plenty of others animals and fishes Some fish tanks will make you laugh some others let you see the very details through a magnifying glass The place is not big but well maintained and definitely worth a visit
14238,4,I came here while visiting the Coex mall with my sister brother in law and wife We came on a weekend using the subway If you travel to the aquarium using the subway you will have to walk a very long way Perhaps the aquarium is on the other side of the mall I felt like we walked the entire length of the mall It was very crowded at the entrance to the aquarium perhaps this was also due to the weekend and at first I was neither impressed or enjoying myself After traveling up an escalator there is a room filled with some pillars that have some fish swimming around in them The pillars are not that large and the fish were rather small I initially thought to myself that this place was pretty lame  However as we walked on further into the aquarium the displays became larger and more elaborate Fish were given their own enclosures and they were more exotic Farther along in the aquarium there was actually large sea animals such as stingrays and sea cows I think there was also a random enclosure that held some monkeys I am not sure why there were monkeys in the aquarium  So the first part of the aquarium was kind of a dud but it certainly got better as you travel further into the aquarium I would recommend coming here on a day when it is not so busy you will have more time to look at the fish and not be pushed along by hordes of people Nice place to go if you like fish and sea animals
14239,3,If you are coming with the kidsthey sure will like itThe location is at the basement of the shopping centre and the air seem isnt so refreshingThe space is smallmorever when a lot of kids come together and running here and thereyou find it is hardly to enjoyHoweverthe species of the fish is much better then i am expectedso it is still worth to come here if you are with kids in your group
14240,4,I wouldnt say Im much of an aquarium junky or anything but this is the third time Ive been to the COEX aquarium but its the first time Ive been with children Friends of my wife and their kids came with us to the aquarium on a Saturday afternoon  First the aquarium was packed Now granted it was a Saturday afternoon in the middle of winter when there is not much going on nor can you go outside to a park or anything so I wasnt very surprised That said if you arent a fan of crowds I would avoid heading down on a weekend I have been to the aquarium on a weekday and its much more relax with more time to stroll around and enjoy the sea life as opposed to the weekends where it seems you are caught up in a wave of people that dictates your viewing experience  The kids seemed entertained enough Ages 9 two girls but after about an hour of walking around the aquarium they had enough and we left for ice cream They had fun at petting section and when they could interact with the fish Also they loved the water show in the big tank  Overall its a pretty good way to kill an hour at COEX while shopping at the mall I will definitely go back again
14241,3,I love aquariums and this one does not disappoint; however its not a great aquarium either Watch out for weekends and holidays as this place can get crammed with kids whose idea of aquarium viewing is running around and banging on the glass
14242,4,I had a great time in this lovely aquarium There were many fish varieties and the tanks were all lovely and clean and the animals looked happy
14243,2,I was terribly disappointed by this aquarium For fifteen bucks a person it had one good tank towards the end of the route but mostly everything else was a childish display of averagelooking fish in what were meant to be unusual situations Goldfish in a toilet bowl Goldfish in a phone booth with mannequins Goldfish in a diorama of a bedroom Things that are meant to make the average visitor squeal and go How cute but with no substance or overall design scheme behind it  Go with your kids if they are easily amused and if you dont care about the educational value of an aquarium Not recommended for anyone over the age of five Seoul Grand Park the zoo had a much better main tank and it isnt even an aquarium
14244,4,If your legs are tired of exploring the huge mall you can take a break and explore this unique aquarium It starts off like a pop art museum having those little fishes place inside a fridgecupboard or even a vending machine as an aquariumbut as you move onthe aqua animals begin to get interesting There are sharksoctopusseals and even electric eelsvery educative and visually exciting especially for kids
14245,3,If youve been to other aquarium in Japan this one is terribly small and not so impressive Not worth the money Entertaining for young children though
14246,5,OHHH Amazing aquarium I have not seen such a big one before It has lots of see animals to see It is for everybody Do not miss this Most of the attractions in Korea have discount for foreigners and Samsung employees check it before taking ticket
14247,4,The place provides you opportunity to appreciate whats available in our oceans The exhibits were well arranged with different themes There is also a place that you can touch the starfish Conveniently located in a convention centre and a mall
14248,3,It is good but did not understand what the hype was all about Children will definitely enjoy it But adults I dont think so It is crowded and most of the fish are seen in other aquariums so I did not find it very special Even the staff there are illinformed The female near the entrance confirmed that camera were not allowed But on going in I see people with all types of cameras Somewhere on a fish tank a small label says flash photography is not to be taken I would recommend to go here if you are absolutely free for that day
14249,3,if you have been to the sydney aquarium or ocean park in hong kong you will very likely be disappointed the aquarium is really small and there is not very much that attract you however if this is the 1st aquarium that you are visiting in your life you should give it a try
14250,3,When youve visited other aquariums such as Okinawa or Atlanta this place does not measure up Its small has a fishy smell is a closed space crowded and is over priced One good thing there are a few different tanks such as s soda machine that are unique to the COEX aquarium If its a rainy day with nothing to do sure stop by and take a look However I would not go out of my way to visit the COEX aquarium save your time for something like Nanta or a place
14251,4,In is located inside of COEX Mall Aquarium is not big but very interesting for children as well as for adult It is better to come there in the morning  afternoon many people go there
14252,1,I went there with my family my mom and my sister so the three of us were in the queue with many other adults who were bringing their children there It might be a school holiday or something since we were there on a weekday but there were many many people around But in any case we were full of expectations knowing that this is the largest aquarium in Seoul But once we were inside we were very disappointed The place is small and cramped and full of people mostly children running here and there The fishes were housed in tanks with magnifying effects so it got rather dizzy after a while Maybe because there were too many people but we were exhausted after jostling around with people for a while Most of the exhibits were not very large and the variety of fishes they had were not very fascinating There was this portion where they housed fishes in exotic tanks like washing machines fridges sinks and toilet bowls and this section was a big hit with children It was a very sad sight for the 3 of us seeing the single lone fish swimming in the limited water the toilet bowl had to offer There was a iguana exhibit too but it was really too small for the beautiful creature We soon came to this exhibit that featured turtles and there was a poor overturned turtle struggling with all its might to turn itself over The sight of the poor turtle thrashing and writhing with all its might broke our hearts but there was no staff nearby In fact there is NO STAFF at all in that big place apart from the staff at the food stalls We had to walk around the place before we found 2 staff who look like they only provide directions and we tried to tell them to help to turn the turtle over This was very different from the other aquariums Ive been to before where there would always be a staff beside each exhibit The poor starfishes in the handson area are also brutalised by the small children who pick them up and throw them back into the water theres no staff again The biggest tanks in this aquarium are not very big and pale in comparison to the ones Ive seen There was a penguin zone but it was very small and somehow the penguins inside didnt look very happy All but too soon the visit ended Yes the place is really small  All in all I would say to visit this place only if you have small children as they would enjoy the hands on pool and the section where they place fishes in fridges etc But for adults trying to learn more about the ocean and fishes and who are looking for a educational and eyeopening experience this place is not the place to go to I personally felt that that the Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan or Ocean Park Hong Kong were much better
14253,4,I had some free time and decided to go check out the Aquarium I read that it was crowded on the weekend but I took my chances anyways I went on Saturday about 1 pm and the reviews were right it was quite crowded but so is every attraction you would go to on a weekend The Aquarium is located in a mall so not the average size Aquarium like they have in the States Because there were so many people you walked through the aquarium in a line If you are patient you will get your chance to get close and can take all the time you want to look My favorite part was seeing how excited the little kids got in seeing the fish Theres a place where they have the Dr fish and you can place your hands in and feel them nibble at the dead skin You can also watch them feed the sharks sea lions penguins etc I enjoyed the touch tank where you can pick up the starfish Even though it was crowded I enjoyed my time at the aquarium and thought the price was worth it I had a smile on my face the entire time If you have children I would definitely bring them here
14254,3,We were a little disappointed in the fact that you had to pay quite a bit of money and it was so small and so crowed with people It cost 17500 for adults and 11000 won for a child We went on a weekend which explains the crowd but had a hard time enjoying it because you had to push your way through to see the tanks
14255,3,is a rather small aquarium which located in side a Mall they offer touch pool which allow visitors to feel the sea creatures it is fun and educational for the kids
14256,5,This was recommended to us It does not look like much from the mall entrance but that certainly changed once we went through it There was so many areas that contained so many fish and other animals It was fantastic They even had a handonarea to feel starfish and other animals Well worth the money
14257,5,I took all my friends who vist Korea first time and I already been in Singapore  Coex aquarium is bigger and neat then compare woth others
14258,5,Great place to take the family Better to go during the week if you can less busy
14259,3,Im not personally a huge fan of aquariums but the concept of one in a mall and the variety of animals that were present gave the outing at the mall a little extra sprinkle of fun When with a friend she mentioned it wasnt anything compared to an aquarium in Washington So it appears that as far as aquariums go this isnt one to be placed on an international ranking scale Just a little extra at a very large and impressive mall in Seoul
14260,5,I went there first when I was showing Seoul around to my bosss family from Singapore Not only the 6 year old girl but everyone enjoyed the visit Their display is not just on glass windowed fish tanks; they use refrigerator cars and even washing machine The Mrs who have been to aquariums around the world with her kids said it was the best shes ever seen and came back the next year with the younger kid The aquarium is really big so I suggest you take a break in the middle where they have icecream stand Otherwise you will be too tired to enjoy the shows at the end This place is also great for couples as you can talk a lot along the way and it is much fun to take photos
14261,3,This aquarium does get very hectic which might account for the lack of tidyness on the day we visited Not all the animals or fish on display were displayed to their best A bit crammed in and a disapointment after being told it was one of the best in Asia
14262,3,Ive been to a number of aquariums this one is nice but nothing special and a little pricey no more expensive than others but unlike most of Korea this isnt any cheaper than other aquariums across the globe
14263,5,It is located inside the mall and easy to do in an hour or two
14264,5,Nice indoor aquarium Quite complete species Easy access
14265,4,Was a pretty good sized aquarium Bring your walking shoes Lots of fishes
14266,4,We actually just stumbled across the aquarium while visiting the mall I must say it was really good We enjoyed it much more than any other aquarium that we have visited There was also several school classes there on a field trip they kids made it even more enjoyable because they were so eager to talk to us and be social We spent a couple hours at the aquarium and also caught an IMAX show while we were there as well It is a very fun day and we would recommend it to any visitor to Seoul
14267,3,Expensive for what it is very difficult to find in the COEX centre However it is still a treat for children under 10
14268,5,To see Coex aquarium takes 2 hours Is a wonderful place to visit while in Seoul Part of a large mall the aquarium covers freshwater as well as marine life Sharks Penguins seals arowanas a turtle with 2 heads costs 15500 wons must see while in Seoul
14269,4,Located in the COEX mall the aquarium is a good reason to go at all Well planned out you will find a wide variety of marine life There are some examples of some really unique fish tanks a tank in which the Surgeon fish can get up close and personal with your hand and even some reptiles for you to enjoy Go during the week if possible the mall and aquarium is much less crowded and more enjoyable If you take your time and stop to enjoy the very wide variety of fish amphibians reptiles and many other animals it should take about a half hour from start to finish
14270,5,Super easy to check in Fast immigration friendly and helpful staff I love Korea already
14271,5,Very nice and Beautiful It was lovely to fly again after a long time The staff are so helpful and Courteous It was  delight
14272,5,its was nice  all staffs and politics its perfect
14273,2,Easy access to central Seoul

14275,4,Nice
14276,5,Great airport everything runs fast
14277,4,It was a good airport I really appreciate the staffs and security all are so kind patient and supportive Thank you all for the wonderful travelling experience through this airport
14278,5,We were let through because the line was too long by the boarding zone The staff was so friendly Theres also so many places to eat and ofcoz a convenient store
14279,4,Satisfied
14280,5,Clean and tidy not crowded
14281,4,An airport in South Korea specializing in domestic flights and international flights in East Asia It is closer to the city and there are fewer queues for entry and exit
14282,3,Wellaligned gates and English Service is available for visitors  There are few places for smoking
14283,4,Small clean wellknown airport the second airport in Seoul opens at 430 in the morning
14284,5,One of the few airports where you can enjoy a toilet with a washlet outside of Japan When I returned to Haneda by connecting from Kazakhstan I was impressed by the washlet here
14285,5,Clean Spacious Kind
14286,5,Very convenience and clean
14287,5,Convenient airport
14288,5,Compared to Indira gandhi airport in India Seoul airport is very clean and less crowded India should learn somethings from these countries
14289,5,Good
14290,5,Its a weekend and as busy as usual
14291,5,Nice
14292,5,Very easy to get bags and get out for a taxi

14294,4,Area is good Well maintained
14295,5,Good airport
14296,3,Good oneExcept parking fee on this
14297,5,Good
14298,2,Cool
14299,3,The airport and staff were for the most part above board Gate seating was fair and I personally liked that trash receptacles were separated into recyclable and nonrecyclable materials But I was concerned with the time it took for check in staff at The China Southern desk to find the necessary Visa information to let us board I admit I had to bite my tongue when we were given information that we knew was patently incorrect with such confidence I had to insist that they check again and it took two staff members at least ten minutes before they realized what we had been saying all along The only small stain on an otherwise wonderful trip to an amazing city
14300,4,Busy airport but the departure and arrival desks have people that speak Englich and there are plenty of places to grab a bite to eat
14301,5,The airport is very clean and calm Make sure you fill out an arrival card before you go to the arrivals desk and then a customs declaration card even if you have nothing to declare before you go out the exit Say hi to the robots too
14302,5,Great food ro have during the hottest  summer season  The chicken is extremely tender and the side dishes made it complete Theres another one like this in Ulsan but using purple rice
14303,5,The ginseng chicken they served taste really good Remember to follow their guidelines on how to consume Chicken
14304,5,All time popular classic I like the gluttonous rice and chestnuts within the chicken
14305,5,I came here the first time in 2007 or 2008 and couldnt forget about this place I came back in 2022 The deep taste of the broth which flavours the chicken meat left us speechless While eating we didnt say a word
14306,5,Best samgyetang in my life Value for money Free ginseng shot tastes really good too I will gladly come again
14307,4,Not bad the price is pretty expensive though
14308,5,Delicious
14309,5,I think is really worth the price  Black chicken is more nutritious than normal chicken The price is included ginseng wine as well  the broth is so so so warmth and nice  Theres several ingredients stuffed in the chicken such as pine nuts ginseng red dates  pumpkin seed  chestnut and glutinous rice if not mistaken   Worth the try if youre visiting gyeongbookgung at the same day 
14310,4,Nice
14311,1,Dont be fooled by the guidebook This is a restaurant for foreign tourists that is not delicious Samgyetang with cold contents was served
14312,5,Im going to Korea to eat this Samgyetang I think its worth it
14313,4,The samgyetang was delicious Very busy so be prepared to wait but the queue moved quickly Inside was a bit like a military operation very efficient but people everywhere flying past with hot food On the higher end of pricing
14314,5,super super super delicious The only recommendation to go to Korea Ginseng chicken Seafood pancakes Pickled radishes are super delicious
14315,3,Traditional Samgyetan in a traditional environment
14316,5,Man this chicken soup is awesome its really good

14318,5,It really lives up to its reputation its really awesome
14319,3,Ginseng chicken soup perfect But the chicken felt a bit underwhelming wasnt that tender Very disappointed and had higher expectations
14320,4,poor toilet But its really delicious
14321,4,Best chicken soup with ginseng
14323,5,Super comforting samgyetang ginseng chicken soup Located in a cute hanok house and it is very spacious with tons of seats Try to avoid peak lunch hours as theres usually a long line  I arrived at 1230pm and the line was all the way down to the carpark Fortunately the line moves pretty fast and I was seated after 20mins Always my goto whenever Im in Seoul and craving a comforting and nourishing soup
14325,5,Ginseng chicken soup is delicious and nutritious Would recommend to all The queue might appear long but it clears rather fast Theres already a queue forming at 1100 Would recommend everyone to come early to avoid queueing too long The roasted chicken taste amazing too

14338,5,No regrets Nuff said
14339,5,A great tourist destination for foodie
14340,4,Tosokchon Samgyetang First proper meal here the weather was chilly at 12  16 degrees and this one did warm my heart  This is a popular restaurant in this area for their samgyetang or ginseng chicken soup

14342,5,Very good ginseng chicken soup
14343,5,Enjoy traditional chichen soup with resonable price
14344,5,Every time I go to Korea I must eat it Its amazing Although it is next to the scenic spot the taste does not cut corners at all But the first time was in 2015 when kimchi was still selfservice and then there was no selfservice
14345,5,most favorite restaurants
14346,5,Authentic Samgyetang though a bit touristy
14347,3,I heard that Samgyetang is a famous restaurant and took me there I thought I was not good at Samgyetang itself It had a lot of bird bones and was hard to eat and the taste was medicinal and useless People who like it seem to like it Local people in South Korea said that it was for tourists and the price was high and the taste was low
14348,5,Super famous and delicious ;
14349,5,This could be bestknown ginseng chicken soup always long in the queue price is reasonable Please try once in every time arrive in Seoul

14373,5,A meal worth waiting for
14374,5,Delicious it wont look like Want to eat other room
14375,5,GOOD
14376,5,A beautiful cathedral that conveys the history of Christianity in Korea
14377,3,Nothing that will blow your mind but it is interesting to see a European style church in the middle of modern Seoul They kind of trap you at the top courtyard and its hard to find the way out however
14378,5,The recorded Christian music is a bit strange and the church loses authenticity as a result Apart from that its not a mustsee place for Europeans
14379,3,There is a very big church in the center of Myeongdong There are quite a lot of sites and it seems that there are various facilities It was said that only believers should enter the shrine disappointing
14380,5,Beautiful church and experience Be respectful and quiet when visiting as people are praying Go to TajIndian restaurant across the street for a meal after
14381,5,We heard anticipated Sunday Mass at 6pm Saturday evening The mass was solemn But most importantly the choir sang beautifully during the mass Everyone was required to wear face masks while inside the church
14382,5,Stunning cathedral
14383,5,The church looks very beautiful and splendid
14384,5,Truly devoted parishioners and pilgrims They seem like they live their faith to the scriptures Parishioners and some visitors seem they go with faith and hope and when they come from the church they look like transformed in a very positive way They seem faithfully committed The place is simple but it makes it majestical Bus and train accessible Lots of stairs for the one who come by the front  Wheelchair accessible by the side of church  Small Chapelle on the basement The best part is that Jesus Christ is present if you listen carefully with your heart   Point yourself towards the Altar English language Mass on Sundays Nuns and priests are welcoming Confession in English available every day
14385,5,Largest cathedral in Korea
14386,5,Holy danctuary
14387,4,The time of the opening of the Grote Kerk is not well indicated unfortunately We have now been to small chapel Out of respect for the others no pictures were taken
14388,5,Peaceful and quiet place in a busy city Beautiful cathedral and surroundings Recommended to visit
14389,4,MyeongDong Cathedral is a real haven of peace in the heart of Seoul a bustling city par excellence And the presbytery will give the impression of being in the middle of Europe and not in Seoul An architecture that clashes but that soothes
14390,5,Gorgeous
14391,5,Beautiful place to

14402,5,Its a beautiful cathedral If you come to Myeongdong you should come there at least once Although its religious establishment it is a historic place that contains the modern and contemporary history of Korea
14403,5,It was cold but the visit was worth it
14404,5,A beautiful place of historical and spiritual significance in Korea By far my favorite church in the whole country The staff were very welcoming and friendly The Christmas decor was breathtaking I will visit whenever I can
14405,5,Nice church suitable to visit at night to take pictures in front of the church with the lights on Its also strategically located in the middle of Myeongdong easy to find
14406,5,One of the best place to feel christmas   seasons
14407,5,There is a large number of Catholic Community in Korea And the center for its congregation is the Myeongdong Cathedral Inside is a glass tinted The Church was built in honor of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception Very Solemn inside if you want to say a prayer

14424,5,Good
14425,5,Very important historic place of Seoul Korea equality and democracy
14426,5,In a word its a holy place
14427,5,I am Italian and in fact the flamboyant neogothic structure is very reminiscent of the churches of Northern Italy with the beautiful polychrome stained glass windows and gothic statues It is to say the least mystical and welcoming Very nice are also the shops that sell souvenirs ointments and lotions and beauty creams  very advantageous prices and they are almost medicinal this is a very bewitching thing for an Italian like me find FUNCTIONAL cosmetics at an affordable price
14428,5,The Cathedral Church of Virgin Mary of the immaculate Conception simply called The Myeongdong Cathedral Holds the cathedra of the Archbishop of Seoul and there are many related institutes near the church Dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary it has two statues of Virgin Mary The church is a holy site for Democratization  of South Korea

14932,5, Its a nice place to go because the weather is so good these days There are many different experiences so its a great place to visit with kids 
14933,5, One of the few places where you can concentrate on nature in downtown Seoul The great advantage is that you can access it without going up the mountain and not far from the subway station 
14934,5, I was able to imagine the life of Joseon which was enjoyed according to status and financial power by moving several houses of the junior college in Seoul 
14935,5, Its a great place for a walk The garden is well established and maintained Its a pity that there arent too many visitors due to Corona 
14936,5,beautiful garden within metropolitan
14937,5, This is a place where you often stop by and heal in the city center 
14938,5, I thought that if a foreign guest came I would go and I wasnt going but I passed by on the way to the meeting It was surprising because it was free and it was nice because it was prettier than expected It is a 
14939,5, Its great to take a cup of coffee and take a break It tastes better on rainy days 
14940,5, Okay well preserved But its a pity that there arent a few buildings for a village 
14941,5,Great place
14942,3, People who havent visited such a place seem to regret it after hitting the ground 
14943,5, Having a space like this in the city is a really big break It is also close to Myeongdong so it is good to be able to do it after 
14944,4, A place where you can go lightly Instead it seems that the parking fee was less than an hour but I paid 3000 won 
14945,5, A place where you can enjoy the taste and taste of hanok It is good to look for it when you have a short time in the city 
14946,3, Parking too narrow The sights are weak and 
14947,4, A place where you can feel the tranquility in the city center 
14948,4, In spring azaleas and forsythia cherry blossoms show a wonderful view of hanok Free opening is a bonus Since parking is difficult it is better to visit from Chungmuro Station on Lines 3 and 4 
14949,4,such a cute and serene place to walk around and hang out at i love this place less touristy than the palace i feel like great to just sit and have a snack
14950,4, Take a moment to look back on the road from Chungmuro Station to Namsan Mountain 
14951,5, Its great for office workers to take a quick walk after lunch  
14952,1,Terrible place Offered coffee coupons for filling out survey but never sent any coupons When contacted they refused all responsibility Avoid
14953,4, A place where you can take a quiet stroll in downtown Seoul 
14954,4, A good course for a walk There is no entrance fee and worth going once at a time 
14955,5, It was nice I couldnt enter the inside of the village because it was stuck at the entrance saying that I could not be accompanied by dogs But it was okay because the promenade was well established and the 
14956,4, The scent of the still warm spring breeze It looks early Even though it is Chinese New Year holidays I cant see the visitors 
14957,4,Nice place for walk and also you can take good photos
14958,4,Warm sunlight is shining It is quiet small and cozy
14959,5, Located near the subway station It is a good place to see 
14960,5, A place that always overflows with great performances  The space is also pretty and the pictures come out well 
14961,4,Excellent Taekwondo demonstration  the reason for my visit Interesting to see how people lived in the past Nice water features throughout which helped with walking around on a hot day
14962,5, I was amazed at the technique of my ancestors that they were able to build such a good construction without a drawing by the instructions of the Dopyeon 
14963,5,Nice quiet and cozy
14964,5, Today it was nice to take a walk as the cold of yesterday went away and the warm wind blew like a warm spring day 
14965,4, There are restrictions on the use of Coronara but its great to have a place like this in the center of Seoul 
14966,5, It is a place where you can appreciate the beauty of Korea in the center of the city and enjoy a leisurely stroll There are also places where you can enjoy tea without a fee 
14967,5, Its the rainy day when it comes to tracking and tracking It was good to match the atmosphere of hanok 
14968,5, Its good for walking and the atmosphere of the Hanok Village creates a happy path for walking and chatting 
14969,5,this place is very nice worth a visit while in seoul
14970,4, Hanok Village under Namsan It is ambiguous to call it Hanok Village because there are not many hanoks but there is also a time capsule square and it is good to take a short break as it is located under Namsan 
14971,4, It is a great place to rest in the city Currently it is difficult to enter the corona 
14972,5,I went at dawn so its not particularly
14973,5, You can feel nature and tradition in the middle of Seoul 
14974,4, It is worth hearing at least once Since the old building was dismantled and moved here it is good to imagine the architecture and life of that era 
14975,2, Disappointment  Hanok Village Sarangchae with vinyl flooring on the floor 
14976,4, It was nice to walk while looking at the scenery comfortably 
14977,4, The place where the security command of the Japanese military military police command was located 
14978,3, I fully enjoyed the beautiful hanok and had a cup of tea 
14979,4, Its good to take a walk after eating so its free so you dont have to worry about it 
14980,4, With nature in the city You can do it and the foliage is also nicely colored To a low mountain 
14981,4, Great for spring and autumn walks and light outdoor learning 
14982,5,Traditional village near namsam recommended place to visit
14983,5, Its good to walk on the Hanok Village Dullegil its late autumn 
14984,5, After watching the movieBapjeong at Daehan Theater  Feel the fall in Namsan Hanok Village 
14985,5, Its great to take your kids It is not too wide you can walk moderately and Myeongdong is also close and if you take the Namsan Loop Bus from the nearest stop you can also go to Namsan Tower 
14986,1, I am looking forward to the night market so much So disappointed 
14987,4, The scenery is beautiful and the surroundings are wellorganized but parking is limited 
14988,3, The parking space is too small Hanok is a pretty place because it is small 
14989,5, There was no snack due to corona but it is worth visiting once 
14990,4, There is also a place like this in Namsan in the middle of Seoul Lovers This is a mustvisit place with children 
14991,4, Good for viewing Namsan Maple Road Unexpectedly there are not so many people so its okay to spend time leisurely In the past I was able to experience traditional costumes but I dont do that because of the 
14992,5, A sacred place for office workers You can watch the office workers near Chungmuro taking a walk during lunch Realize how important a space is to heal even a little bit of tiring business hours Fighting hard and 
14993,5, I came soaking in the atmosphere of a hanok in the city center 
14994,5, A resting place in the city A very nice place A place where you can digest and heal once you have lunch and go around 
14995,5, In 1984 all the places where I lived in the military were changed so I felt empty but it is a place where I enjoyed youth 
14996,5, I went on a trip with a foreign friend and I enjoyed watching the night view 
14997,4, Its been a while since I took the Busan Songdo Cable Car so it was crowded and hot 
14998,4,Rad
14999,2, Beautiful the city from above but the times written on the site and on Google to go up the tower were until 11pm and at 930pm we were told that we could no longer go up 
15000,4, Not enough parking spaces Its been 10 years since I came here more people 
15001,2,Boring
15002,5, The mens restroom on the first basement floor is in good condition A lot of people come and go every day 
15003,4, You can enjoy the night view of Gangbuk in Seoul by cable car The only downside is that the parking lot is expensive 
15004,5,To  fro from Seoul Tower crowded at times
15005,5,Quote a lovely place with a good view Worth taking a trip up here if you are i seoul I recommend going there during the evening but not so late that everything is closed Right after sundown is perfect
15006,5,Staff were professional and courteous Appreciated the friendly humor
15007,4, There is nothing interesting except the cable car The kids had so much fun riding the cable car 
15008,5, Parking is a bit expensive but it is recommended for a memorable trip 
15009,3, 11000 won one way It was 14000 won round trip The trail is wellmaintained so descending on foot is not a problem 
15010,5,Worth a visit and see Seoul from the top
15011,5, best of scenery Great for a quick beer 
15012,4, I went because my child wanted to ride the cable car but the parking fee was wicked 
15013,4,Good ride from Seoul city Nearby Myeongdong station 5min taxi
15014,5, You may have to wait a bit on the weekend but it was nice that the line went out quickly 
15015,4,The scenery is outstanding 
15016,4,Very packed in one car
15017,5,If you dont wanna walk  take the Cable Car
15018,5, I didnt have high expectations as I didnt have a good relationship with the cable car but I felt better than expected The night view is wonderful I also went to Mt Seorak but I felt even better because it was a 
15019,5,Scary and fun at the same time
15020,5, The night view was also beautiful It would be nice to come on a clear day 
15021,3, Its nice to be able to climb The price has gone up a lot 
15022,1, Not good in many ways not recommended unless its off time 
15023,4, Highly recommended unless its a bit hot inside and youre not afraid of safety 
15024,5,Resealable price for  cabin car  Nice view and yummy food  at the top of Tower
15025,5,Legit and a great view of paradise specifically at night
15026,5, Even in hot summer when you go to the top a cool breeze blows 
15027,5,Cable car experience was enjoyable
15028,2,Dont go on weekend  cuz they accept too much visitors  you always stuck in the line whereever you go in namsan tower
15029,5, Its a hot but very relaxing trip I got a discount with a tok deal purchase 
15030,1, The price is too expensive 14000 won round trip for adults 10500 won round trip for children The price is high but it is stuffy smelly and hot because 3040 people are put 
15031,2, You have to wait a long time If it wasnt for the summer I wouldnt have used it 
15032,5,Breath taking
15033,5, Its a little hot but it takes a few minutes to get on its fast the view is beautiful 
15034,1, Expensive expensive nothing to see even parking is too expensive 
15035,1, Roundtrip cable car 28000 light waiting line too long Park in the nearby public parking lot under Namsan Mountain 
15036,2, The time to ride the cable car is not very long but the building waiting for the ride turns on the air conditioner but the inside of the cable car is too hot because there is no air conditioner 
15037,5,Efficient clean cable car that provides a quick and easy way up to Namsang Tower Nice facilities at the bottom station
15038,5, The atmosphere of the old tower has changed a lot The air conditioning is good 
15039,5, Its been a while since Ive been here but its still the same The waiting area was cool and airconditioned 
15040,3, Cable cars and parking fees are expensive When I went up to the top of Namsan Tower it was a market place and there wasnt much to see than I thought 
15041,3,I personally think the cable car is over priced They try to fit as many people as they can in the cable car so you cant really enjoy the scenery and experience for the price you pay We had seniors with us so we took the cable car If 
15042,4, The price is a bit high for a short distance It is recommended for the elderly or the infirm to climb on foot 
15043,5,Good
15044,3,Too packed for covid era
15045,5, The best way to climb Mount Nam is to use the cable car while avoiding the weekend period Climbing the stairs is very tiring 
15046,2, Its a normal cable car its a bit expensive 
15047,5,Amazing
15048,4, Dont bring a car take a taxi when you get off take a bus 
15049,5,The view at night is gorgeous
15050,4, I know that the cable car has been around for quite some time but it seems to be well maintained The whole thing was made of glass so it was good to see the whole view because it was full of people Im glad it 
15051,5,A lovely experience recommended
15052,5,Easy way to get up to Seoul Tower Great views on cable car and at tower
15053,3, Its a pity that a lot of people ride together in a cable car so its only for going near the summit as if there are about two cable cars 
15054,3,You can go by feet not really a added value to go with the cable
15055,5, Its been a long time since I rode the cable car and it was good 
15056,5,This is the only way to ascend up to Seoul Tower for your first trip Its inexpensive and a very smooth ride If you are American military you can purchase a discounted combination ticket of the gondola ride and a trip up to the top of the tower
15057,5,nice trip up so i didnt have to walk those stairs but took the stairs down there were a lot of people going onto that cable car and i didnt feel like being a sardine in it bought a round trip ticket but oh well it wasnt expensive or anything
15058,5, While waiting for the cable car the air conditioner inside the room was so full that it was cold very cool 
15059,5, It is easy to climb even in hot weather You can see the whole city of Seoul 
15060,5,Easy to go up to the tower
15061,5,Easy way to get to the tower waiting time is not long
15062,5,It was a quick and easy journey up and down Cool scenery as well
15063,5,I guess the best way to enter in the N Seoul Tower
15064,5,Namsan Cable Car  Excellent well managed safe
15065,2, Parking is especially difficult on weekends and public holidays 
15066,3, Parking fee 20000 won for 2 hours No discount even if you use the cable car It seems like an expensive parking lot 
15067,5,Nice ride many food choices at the tower even Cinnabon Theres an elevator that can make it easier to get there Walking up to the cable car can be exhausting for some people
15068,5,Friendly Staff good price
15069,5, I went for a couple beer set but I couldnt eat it because it was late If you go the next day after rain when the clock is good the scenery is 
15070,5, The view is pretty good when you take the cable car Seoul at your feet 
15071,3, Waiting for the gable car takes too long The best thing to do is to go up and see the night view There are too many lines for the cable car that came down The price is also expensive Its hard to get a taxi late 
15072,4, Top but beware accessibility for people with disabilities is not easy 
15073,3, During my 100 visits to Namsan Ive only ridden it twice this time third ride 
15074,5,Very good
15075,5, It is the fastest way to get to Seoul Tower and with a very beautiful view of the city and the forest It is approximately a 2minute drive and the view from the Tower to the city is spectacular  
15076,3, Its dense but rides well enough to breathe Its a big deal if you move 
15077,5, See the surrounding view of Seoul suitable for children and elderly people 
15078,4,a little crowded decent price great view save your calves
15079,5,Was busy but had a great time The parking can be challenging so be patient
15080,3, Its a short ride and on a foggy day its raining Please use public parking lots where possible Parking in front of the boarding point is too expensive 
15081,5,Amazing views of the city and surrounds on a clear day
15082,2, I dont really recommend it because its expensive compared to the travel time and facilities and there are many other ways to get to the top Compared to cable cars in other tourist destinations the view while 
15083,5, Because Im always in Seoul I get hit even more One day I will have a child and I will definitely find you again Then well talk about this 
15084,5, I am very satisfied that I can climb to the top with no effort 
15085,3, It is a place that does not come with a good value for money You cannot see the surrounding scenery and it feels like you are overcrowding people 
15086,5, Eat pork cutlet and go up Its better to have coffee from the top and come down 
15087,5,Comfortable
15088,5,On sunny and clear days you can enjoy a wonderful view
15089,5,Great experience  with a nice view
15090,5,Defenetly need to be visit View from the top is the best
15091,4, It is a bit expensive but you can enjoy the night view comfortably with low quality 
15092,5, Its a short but good cable car to enjoy the view of Seoul isnt it 11000 won one way 
15093,5,Nothing special but if you dont want to hike up to Seoul tower then definitely take the sky car Convenient
15094,4, Please dont overfill the cable car as its over when its full by the window 
15095,5,Safety I love it
15096,5,Very nice and helpful employees
15097,3,Expensive for what it is Once at the top theres another 50 steps to get to the tower ticket office
15098,5,Good place to visit
15099,5, Just a must to do While walking it is beautiful and you can take beautiful pictures When you get to the top the view is magnificent 
15100,5, A vehicle in which you are taken to Puaj Namsan Well worth a visit 
15101,5,Use the cable car to easily reach the Seoul Tower A great view awaits you especially at night a visit is particularly worthwhile
15102,5, After the rain the weather was clear and it was very nice 
15103,4, Because it was a holiday the line was very long I waited about an hour I bought a roundtrip ticket but when I got off I just got off and got a refund When I came down the stairs were huge so when I went up I 
15104,5, There were a lot of people From a distance I thought I would go slowly and enjoy it enough but when I rode it in person it was pretty fast 
15105,5,It is very busy and the road is short Theres no need
15106,5,Very well organised boarding
15107,4, Its a holiday so its really complicated Its a clear Seoul for about an hour to ride the cable 
15108,4, There is a terrible waiting line and a lack of undiscounted parking spaces but it is very expensive and a bit cheap but it is difficult because it is far away Its really so No I cant forget all the hardships 
15109,1, The problem is that Ive been waiting too long Take the number 1 near the Chariri subway station and go up 
15110,4,Nice although a little bit expensive
15111,4, I parked for a while to use Namsan parking lot and there is a coffee shop in the building so I went in and ordered coffee but the price is high and the taste is not as strong as Mega or Ediya coffee which is cheap 
15112,4, It runs every 10 minutes and costs 10000 won You can choose between going up on foot or using this cable car which takes less than 5 minutes to go up 
15113,5,Great experience
15114,4,Good and fast ride
15115,3,too many people during weekend
15116,4,In weekend its very popularyou have to wait cable carbut you can walk to the top
15117,5, The place where Neymar visited and caused a fire You only have to ride it once Its not cheap but 
15118,5, The easiest way to get to Namsan if you absolutely dont want to walk Alternatively there would also be buses and taxis that go almost all the way to the summit And of course the hiking trails but they are very 
15119,5,Fun ride  I suggest walking down cool views of the tower you wont get from the car ride
15120,5,Superhero
15121,4, Riding the cable car is always fun but it feels too short 
15122,3, On a hot day its okay to hit the mountain If its good the parking fee is crazy 
15123,5, Dont you have this Think of walking Uhhuh Namsan Cable Car is here but parking is difficult on weekends 
15124,5, The weather was nice and the open Seoul sky was beautiful I highly recommend Namsan Cable Car 
15125,2, Refugee camps Children can be crushed so be careful 
15126,5,Just Funny
15127,5, A lot of couples go there on the weekend When I went on a weekday I saw foreign tourists and people who came on a memorable trip 
15128,5, It is more convenient to climb Namsan than by bus It is about a 10minute walk from Myeongdong Station There is no big difference between the oneway and roundtrip prices 
15129,3, A group of four with two elementary school children wentFriday evening The scenery was nice and everything was good I waited 40 minutes to go up and 
15130,5,Amaying view over the city Was here early evening 630 pm I would prefer round trip ticket  the entrance tobthe tower is included Tip Watch the video in the elevator
15131,5,Waited for almost 2hr to get the ride and the cable car was super packed
15132,5,Beautiful sight of Seoul from above We went at night and it still was great to see at that time
15133,3,Waited about a half hour to up
15134,5,It was safe but Im scare
15135,4,Good experience
15136,4, Koreas first cable car to Namsan a representative attraction in Seoul 
15137,5, I went to the comfortable side I didnt mean it but lol 
15138,3, Too expensive and parking too expensive Im glad its a good day 
15139,4, Good for family and good for lovers but the distance is a bit short 
15140,5, It was nice to have a variety of attractions and cultures 
15141,5,Was a really fun way to get to Namsan Tower Do recommend
15142,5, Cable car roundtrip recommended It is recommended to come at sunset time and take a look View restaurant  
15143,3, It feels a bit expensive and there are many people who only walk when going up and ride only when going down 
15144,4, it was good The waiting time wasnt as long as I thought but I took off one star because of parking 
15145,5,It was nice view of nature from the cable car although there was crowd due to Childrens day holiday Return ticket costs 13k
15146,3, On public holidays you will have to wait for 2 hours Its a bit futile when its all over 
15147,5, Beautiful environment5 a must visit place when you are in Seoul In the evenings it is quite a beautiful sight 
15148,2, Its worth riding at least once out of curiosity I dont want to recommend the second time I feel like I lost a lot in terms of cost performance 
15149,5,Waiting time was not too long Very organized
15150,4, The cable car ends at 11 If you go after 10 oclock you can either ride up and walk down or live there with a bunga bunga 
15151,4,Considering how short the ride is it is quite pricey Nice view on the city especially from the observation deck If you are lazy like me you can use it to get to the top of the mountain and then on the way back use stairs to save a penny
15152,3, The price is expensive compared to the ride time And its inconvenient to buy a ticket Its inconvenient to get a ticket and line up again 
15153,4,This trip takes probably 23 minutes to go up and down to the N tower building however if you love exercising and are in good shape you can go up and down just by walking
15154,5, Its great to have an open place when youre frustrated The dazzling night view in 2 years makes me feel better 
15155,3,Try this once But it is too expensive and the ride is short
15156,2,Expensive
15157,5,Simple is good help being polite and patient
15158,5,Fantastic cable car
15159,3,Lousy service Bad attitude to foreigners and pregnant women
15160,5,Awesome feeling All you must try this Fare is 13000won for the round trip Love south Korea 
15161,5,Simply Awesome The fare is 13000won for round trip
15162,1, After taking the Namsan Cable Car on an outing to Seoul with my friends I bought a ticket to go to Namsan Tower but it didnt work so I bought a ticket with the help of young students and went to the boarding 
15163,5,In here you can see the people climbing up the Namsan and when you go on the top you can see the Namsan Tower
15164,4,Worth it if you dont want to walk up Itll be a better experience if you do walk up being a part of the nature
15165,4, The scenery is very good there are few people if I go on weekdays 
15166,5, The night view is beautiful but it is still very windy at night 
15167,5, After a long time I went to Namsan for a childs homework It reminds me of the old days its good 
15168,4,Its a short transfer up Would look pretty in autumn winter or spring summer when its colorful
15169,3, If you come early for the date course there is plenty of parking 
15170,4, The cable car we took to go to Namsan Tower It is one of the attractions in Seoul that celebrated its 60th anniversary this year 
15171,4, I waited too long to get on a Saturday afternoon The cable car I decided to ride while on a walking outing with my lover after a long time was too long for a moment Cover 50 minutes Decided to walk up next 
15172,5,Ok
15173,5,Great
15174,1, The time waiting for the cable car has passed so I just watched it with my own eyes 
15175,4,heres the prevailing price at the momentif you just wanted to experience the ride you can try it and hike downhillthere are lots of options
15176,3, Ok trip but nothing special Nice to not have to go up the stairs yourself 
15177,4, Its good that the cable car gets a resident discount The discount for residents of N Tower is now over Even on the weekend there is only one tower elevator for the Sea of Clouds 
15178,4, Namsan Tower is expensive but a place you must visit with your parents as a memory 
15179,3, I didnt go to Namsan Cable Car I went for a walk on Namsan Mountain after lunch 
15180,4, Its fast the night view is good and its very convenient to climb Namsan without difficulty But on a weekend evening the wait is terrible Is it because we are in front of the corona pandemic 
15181,5, Central location in Seoul A view of the city where you can hear the quiet breath of a wonderful city with a night view 
15182,5, There are three ways to get to the top of Namsan Mountain on foot by bus by cable car The most elegant choice among them However the boarding fee seems expensive compared to the short driving time 
15183,5, Pets can be accompanied by dogs but a stroller is required 
15184,5, Since it was a weekend there were a lot of people riding the cable car so I had to wait for over an hour but the night view of Seoul from the top made me forget about tiredness and boredom 
15185,5, If you take the cable car be sure to take it towards the city center 
15186,3, Its too soon what can I say I just dont want to go up the stairs 
15187,3, Its good because its convenient Isnt 10000 won per person a bit expensive 
15188,4, Parking was very difficult Still thanks to the cable car that makes my childhood memories unforgettable 
15189,5, When I was young I thought It came down so quickly that it was futile 
15190,5, with my daughter  Take the cable car Eat pork cutlet too  
15191,2, Streets too short for a serious experience and facilities are outdated and messy 
15192,3, Im worried because too many people are on board at once The price is also expensive

15207,5,Glad to take the cable car up instead of climbing the hill up Very nice scenery
15208,3, Although it has a bit of history it is perfect to climb comfortably rather than walk to see the whole of Seoul 
15209,2, The distance is short the fare is expensive and the parking fee is terribly expensive When it gets a little bit hot there is a paid public parking lot Please use the parking lot right next to the car road not 
15210,5, Its good to get on and off but for a while the night view of Seoul from the cable car was also very good
