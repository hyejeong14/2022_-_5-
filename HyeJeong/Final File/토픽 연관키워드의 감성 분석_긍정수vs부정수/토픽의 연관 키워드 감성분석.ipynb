      "let me start by saying no matter what this is a must when you visit seoul when we first get there the line for the cable car was so long it extended well out into the sidewalk we opted for the hike instead its not easy once you get there theres another long line to get your tickets to go up once you get your ticket the wait is about 2 hours for your group to be called pay attention to group numbers because the lady told me it would be a 2hr 45min wait after they call your group its another long line for the elevator to get up there once you get up there theres a ton of people crowding the glass areas even eating in front of it its also very noisy souvenir shops also take up most of the floor space so ppl dont really have much elbow room once youre done with taking pictures yup theres another long line to get back down at this point you can tell everyone is cranky and tired its not all bad tho views were pretty good and there there are plenty of things to do while you wait for your group to be called make sure to wear comfortable sneakers because this will be a rough one\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",

      "visited this socalled seoul tower but it was not impressive as it was just too low to offer a good view of seoul skyline the lift just took 5 minutes to reach the viewing deck i hardly could take decent shots of the skyline as the glass were blurred by the reflections caused by the bright lighting from the candy and souvenir shops on the deck level to make matter worse the attendants could not speak english when i asked for direction to get down from the tower so dont expect too much from this dwarf tower\n",

      "this is one of the main landmarks in seoul the waiting lines were dredful line to the cable car to the elevator etc the view to the tower is amazing cuz its in namsan park but to tell the truth it wasnt really that much you can do up there haha\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "we went to the tower just before sunset so we could capture both day and night views i have seen this in many kdramas so it was wonderful to see in person we decided to take the lift up but didnt realise how long the line was if you dont mind walking up it may save you some time the tower is impressive and there are many photo opportunities around we didnt go up the tower as it was an additional cost and the day we went was foggy hindering good views we felt it wouldnt add many city views as the free areas had fabulous cityscape views there are a lot of exhibitions to look at but some are additional costs the highlight of these exhibition has to be the stunning dresses in the hanbok museum\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "my family  i went with a friend to n seoul tower at night  it is fantastic according to our friend the view is normally foggy because of the dessert sand that blows from china but with luck we werr able to get clear skies  a wonderful view of seoul  totally it was organized  well maintained the only hindrance we had was that we are not used to the weather because we live in a tropical country so for us 14 degrees is a bit cold  we had to wait in line outside for our gondola to take us down  we couldnt get shelter from the cold because we would loose our spot  overall i would recommend this to any first time travels to south korea\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "i like its location easy and accessible if you go to seoul this place must go quite interesting and from there you can see many places of seoul just that need to line up for at least 12 hrs\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "it seemed like the thing to do so we booked a tour that included the n seoul tower it was nice but basically like any other space needle our guide had us up to the top pretty quickly but if you have to wait in those 12 hour lines find something else to do\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "ive been to seoul multiple times but never made it up to the tower until this last visit it was pretty much what i expected def not lacking on cheesytourist standstchotchkes but im giving it 4 stars still because of the absolutely gorgeous views of seoul they even have little map lines on the windows so you can see what neighborhoods youre looking at plus you blast off to space in the elevator which is pretty hilarious and awesome  just for the views alone id recommend everyone going at least once\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "the tower is a seoul staple and worth a visit im a big fan of skyline views and enjoyed it although the city doesnt really boast anything extremely impressive to see in terms of visible landmarks the fact that it is so vast and so alive makes it worth it  be warned that the lines are really longlonger than what ive experienced for similar landmarks of this nature in other major cities this might be due to the fact that i visited during the ideal time and managed to catch the sunset worth it\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "im not normally a huge fan of going up to high places to look at citieson the ground is more interestingbut this was worth it seoul is incredibly large and these views are the only way to get the full sense of it the system is pretty good for getting people up the tower and back downbut know that the line can get long for the down elevator\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "we went to n seoul tower on a saturday night and it was packed they had a queueing system according to the time you bought the tickets to board the lift it was very poorly managed with only 1 staff at the entrance which resulted in many visitors going in when the staff is occupied we waited for nearly 50 mins before we were able to board the elevator up we were there at night and the view was alright having been to other attractions such as marina bay sands  taipei 101 the view was pretty disappointing as compared to them we thought the worst of the queueing was over but we still had to queue to get down to the main lobby needless to say we spent the majority of our time waiting in line and it wasnt a pleasant experience so go only to check it off your travel list of places to visit in seoul\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "you cant see much the employees go around and scrape off the ice but they dont seemed to bothered to rush it which they should be given that i paid 16000 to get there and back long lines at every point cable car and elevator there and back but the elevator does have a video that shoots you into space and then brings you back to seoul\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "loved the cable car stairs and ride up; wellkept grounds and shops at the top i did not like the cheezey video in the elevator that the attendant insisted we watch  she barked at a member of our group to look up and watch it after she had made it clear it made her dizzy trust us to make our own decisions the locks and hearts of couples was fun and the park at the base a nice place to spend a cool couple of hours go early enough 56pm ishso lines are less for the dark night sky viewing large steps up and down from cable care to park base so workin the calf muscles and the knees be careful i did not go to the teddy bear museum so have no opinion burger bar inside the tower had awesome hamburgers pricey at 7 but we splurged as it was 4th of july\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",

      "if using the train go to the jamsil station you can get to lotte world without going outside there is a connection underground i have been to many amusement parks and i would not say that this has the best rides but i would say that it was a really fun environment and a fun place for kids and for friends just walking around and going on rides they do have some really awesome rides for adults but i dont think the adults will be doing the hair and dress up to be a princess for the day especially when all the dresses are kids sizes they have parades and showtimes which are great right now they still have the halloween decorations up in the halloween shows going on and i have to say they did an amazing job the lines for the rides are pretty long on the weekends especially after 4 pm be aware that tickets have a discounted price after 4 which means a lot more people are there so there is a pretty big crowd for the halloween show in magic island make sure you hold your kids hands or you will lose them after 4 it is also common for lines on rides to run an hour to 150 minutes for wait time no exaggeration\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "we got our tickets online with a magic pass 5 options basically you can choose 5 rides and cut the queues without having to book the timing like the magic pass on the main website the entrance tickets are also discounted on the third party website apparently it is a promotion only for foreigners so you have to bring your passport  the park itself was great fun there were lots of rides for all thrill levels both indoors and outdoors atlantis gyro drop and french revolution were some of the more thrilling rides i remember riding definitely worth using the pass for if you visiting with young kids i did see there were some rides that were only for young kids the park really caters to all ages  for the instagram mets there was also an area inside near the vr attractions for taking selfies the selfie studio is set up with sets and props as well as tripods for rent we loved taking pictures with the various backdrops  we happened to be there for halloween so there was also costume rentals and face painting extra costs near the entrance there was even a haunted house set up not to forget the halloween parade we saw that they even has some of the park guests who were dressed as princesses participate  lots of food affordable food available as well food stalls as well as set restaurants and food courts were available all over the park there seems to have been no issues about bringing your own too we brought in our own water  when it was time to go we exited into the mall and we glad to find that there was a lotte mart around the corner of the exit so manage to squeeze in a little grocery shopping before having to head back  overall i felt it was a fun place to visit for the whole family\n",

      "we went to lotte world on a beautiful october day in seoul our guesthouse mmmio house highly recommended was close to a subway station and from there it took us about half an hour to get to lotte world on the other side of the river which splits seoul in two parts upon arrival at the jamsil station green line 2 by subway the signs direct you immediately to the lotte department store and other lotte things to dosee including lotte adventure world as we prefer not to wait in line we were excited to see ticket machines which also displayed information in english after having tried all of them we asked staff why the english version on the machines did not work and were told that the machines are not for foreigners staff very nicely directed us to the counter to buy tickets second in line suddenly the counter closed and we were directed to another line this was not nice but ok since only about 6 people were waiting in front of us now after half an hour  waiting we could finally buy our ticket but were asked for our passports not being made aware by anybody that we needed passports i luckily realized that i had a residence card from another country with me a few discussions later with different staff we were allowed to buy four tickets the cost usd 150 seemed high it was a fairly quiet day in the park so the waiting for most attractions was not bad the park has three or four levels and from each level you can see the levels below there is also an outside area with more attractions the park is in the middle of the city and it is quite amazing how they have used the limited space to build so many attractions although we had tickets which allowed us to access all attractions we did have to pay for one attraction the tomb of horror or something like that it is approx usd 25 per person everland is a more recently opened amusement park and bigger than lotte adventure world but further away early 2016 a brand new amusement park will be opened\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "ok so before you go to lotte world ask yourself a couple of questions  do you like lines do you like noisy eating areas do you like hidden costs do you want to feel more like a dollar sign and less like a human  if you answered yes to these then lotte world is for you  the whole place is terribly busy and designed poorly you feel crampt even not waiting in a line when your waiting in a line prepare for camping a couple of hours with most main rides taking at least 120min wait the rides that didnt are poor or average at best  the eating areas were open right next to rides so prepare for a noisy experience when you want to relax for lunch like dining in a club  many attractions inside actually cost money so when you see a big queue and head for the short queue you find it costs \\3000  the staff were very rude and not fun they didnt care about their customers and didnt have that fun land happy attitude i would expect from such a place  all in all the place was dull with crampt almost unfinished rendered corridors at parts with dull lighting it almost seemed like each area had its own budget and refused to fund the walkways between  honestly everything that fails at this place is a win at everland some people say they hate the happy music and smiles of everland but a place like this should be that way and trust me happy cheerful smiles go a long way to make the scene  a final note  please just accept these things and you will have a good time if you go in expecting a diamond you wont find that just be patient get a snack for the queues and dont limit yourself to a short visit\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "like a mini disneyland hong kong spent a day here in the rain  most rides were operational indoor ice skating rink was cool but had to pay extra to get in annoyed but wasnt that much extra the lotte world adventure ticket is already quite pricey  most kids are more suited for kids but we went on the  gyro drop  comet express really cool rollercoaster ride  the haunted house laughed more than being scared  giant loop heaps fun  be prepared to wait in line dedicate a day trip here the fantasy mask parade was interesting to watch  mix of asian and caucasians performing families with little kids may be invited to join the performance as well there was a mirror maze which we had lots of fun in  overall a fun day out\n",

      "lotte world is advertised as the worlds largest indoor amusement park it surely feels like it the huge dome with its central skating ring and surrounding rides are an impressive sight having such a large park in the heart of a 25 million metropolis is amazing however lotte world might not be your best option for entertainment in or around seoul lotte world is straight up inferior to everland ridewise with fewer rides especially thrill rides such as roller coasters which also means that each ride will be packed with quite a long line that can top an hour for the best rides so if youre a roller coaster enthusiast i recommend checking out everland instead in addition the park is 25 years old and feels like it it doesnt feel quite new especially for outside attractions the parks attractions and stores all have this slightly off color and design that didnt age all too well also the lotte world now fails in comparison to the building next door the new 2nd lotte world complex which features numerous dining and shopping options as well as what will soon become the tallest tower in the ocde overall i do recommend checking out the park and its surroundings but would advise against staying there an entire day the good thing is that for people who come in rather late in the afternoon the park offers discounted price and thats a great value proposition to just come in and enjoy the park for 3 or 4 hours rather than the entire day\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "for those who visited seoul it is a must for you to visit this amazing amusement park lotte world where its offers a lot of adventerous games and lots of fun  if you facing time constraint you may go to lotte world instead of everland where you can reach there by using the metro line refer website you may also enter after 4pm where the price is a lil bit cheaper but remember to explore all the activities as many as you can before 8pm because they will present you an amazing indoor parade around 820pm all the activities will be temporary stop by then and continue after 9pm  just enter whatever activities available because youll be suprise with the games and activities\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "the place looks awesome  fantastic for wide eyed kids and kids at heart like me  the kiddie rides are fast queueing the other adult type rides of course have long lines and a waste of stay time  the lunch queueing is worse aladdin should add more cashiers when the lunch surge kicks in the lone cashier is simply overwhelmed by the volume of people  in all if rides are all that matter then this is the best place if youre planning on getting the lunch ticket i suggest you dont bring your own food or just get some from the other hotdog cencessionaires\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "i went on a sunday probably should have avoided the weekend but managed to ride all of the adult attractions in a day  really enjoyed myself yes the wait in the lines can be quite long but there is wifi  sometimes you can get bumped up the line if you are flying solo  i really recommend the french revolution atlantis  comet express rides if you are into rollercoasters  the food onsite was rather average although the treats icecream etc were good\n",

      "entry after 4pm is discounted and foreigners also get a 15 discount it was pretty busy with teenagers and families on a friday night be warned that some rides close early in the evening so plan your trip well the rides are fun with atlantis being the best although there were some very long lines there are plenty of places to eat drink and hang out yes its lame but youll have fun\n",

      "it is situated right outside jamsil subway station green line and the 1 day admission fee is reasonable 38000 won there are many attractions in the indoor themepark and most of them are suitable for children and family  the outdoor themepark at magic island has a few extreme rides the gyro drop is highly recommended if you like the feeling of instantly being sucked down to earth from 70m above ground also atlantis adventure a super fast roller coaster is also one of its main attractions it has a few big drops and the speed is extremely fast highly recommended if you love great speed and drops there is also a bungee drop similar to the gyro drop but shorter and not so extreme  worth spending a day here\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",

      "sweet little theme park that is not overblown good for kids big kids and adults who are kids inside great way to enjoy a day  lotte world theme park is not overly crowded most rides will require about 3050mins to line up for indoor activities are quite numerous but are aimed at younger audiences be warned some 4d rides can get you very dizzy outside is fun but can get colder at night  no extreme thrill rides such as a crazy roller coaster and some rides are notin operation appweb is not updated about statusthey have some theme halloween but arent as committed as other parks lotte mascots are not as relatable to foreigners\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "admittedly im not sure if we got lucky or whatever but it was a tuesday there were kids on their field trip there but despite that there were no lines majority of it is indoors with a train that goes around the indoor area and around the outdoor area too that said it was rather fun and this coming from a guy that doesnt particularly enjoy theme parks just be aware that the b3 entertainments with the vr and ice skating know that those do not come with your entrance so dont be surprised if you need to pay extra for those\n",

      "spent my birthday this year here with my husband and two young boys and it ended up being such a fun day the boys were excited from the moment we entered it was indoors so it was perfect during the rainy weather we went on a friday and there were not that many people so the lines for the rides were not bad at all i cant imagine how the lines would be on a weekend everything was cute and catered for kids there were adult rides as well but we didnt go on them there are lots of places to get food and we ended up eating at their fancy italian restaurant for lunch to celebrate the food was delicious and price was not too bad at the top floor they have this area like the alive museum which was fun for everyone the place was not too big so it wasnt overwhelming like disneyland or disneyworld i thought it was just the right size for a one day visit we got combo tickets for the lotte world and the lotte aquarium from klook which was a great deal\n",

      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "the highlight of this park is that its inside it was nice to get out of the cold temperatures but the lines for all of the attractions were so long that we only made it on 4 rides the whole day if you can find a time when its less busy im sure it would be more fun\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "lots to do and the tickets are good value however the queues were simply horrendous average of 90 minutes to 2 hours for each ride we downloaded the app to book rides according to time slots but there was an online queue too my kid did enjoy it and the balloon rides over the whole park is great for young children\n",

      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "we had a late flight on our last day in seoul and thus we planned to visit lotte world because it didnt require a private tour guide we hired one for the prior three days to take us around seoul the park is easily accessible by subway and the station that serves lotte world is jamsil station which is on subway lines 2 and 8  i think the park carter to younger kids most rides are familiar and expected to be in a theme park nonetheless the kids still had a great time  the price of food at their food court is reasonable and some taste good indeed although its an indoor park a small portion of it is outdoor and connected by a bridge all in all its good on very hot or raining or cold weather \n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",

      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "this is definitely a place for small children everything is geared for the young kids who like fairytales if you have visited disney or any of the great america parks the only thing to say is that the lines are shorter the rides are on a caliber of many of the county and neighborhood fairs throughout america that said we spent an enjoyable four hours walking around and watching tons of people of people really having fun there were groups of kids from schools and parents with their kids getting the thrill of a lifetime\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "there is so much to do here from all the rides to the games to the shopping it is a fun place not only for children but children at heart the lines are a bit long on some of the rides but worth the wait\n",

      "we went with a 35 and almost 2 year old and they had a blast there were tons of things for them to do we hit all but like 2 rides that those under 100cm could do and we were there nearly all day we went on a monday and i think our longest line was maybe 10 minutes we were disappointed that the playground in the kids zone was close it would have been nice to have known that before we of course had a short tantrum but it was really great and fun for the littles there was one ride that was pretty out dated fantasy dream or something 80s creepy animatronic\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "you know how a samsung phone is fine if thats all you have but the design and interface pales in comparison to an iphone lotte world is like that compared to a disneyland experience its modeled after disneyland but is an obvious fake but entertaining to see nonetheless  we managed to visit with an online 50 off deal for foreign passport holders for 24000 won each about 20 usd so for that price it was a fine thing to do the wait for rides was 6090 minutes in the heat with nothing to look at not like at disneyland where the lines are even an immersive part of the ride  atlantis was a great ride that we did twice french revolution was so jarring that it gave us all mild concussions the wait for the hot air balloons and the comet express were 70 minutes so we skipped those we knew we were visiting tokyo disneysea a few days later so we felt we had all gotten our 20 worth and called it a day after 3 rides that took about 5 hours to complete  so if this is the only amusement park you can get to its fine but if you have other experiences lotte world is fine only if you can get a big discount and have teenagers you need to appease for a day\n",

      "this indooroutdoor amusement park is quite pricey but if you came after 4 pm you can buy discounted ticket for 26000 won indoor section is most likely for children but it can be fun for adults too while outdoor section is filled with some sorts of adrenaline pumping rides it also has a giant skating rink but you have to purchase different ticket from lotte world ticket lotte world is easily accessible via subway since one of the subway station exit is within lotte mall\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "lotte world is a gentle and enjoyable experience its a great place to stroll around hopefully catch a character parade or a show its not an amusement park for those who have to have a lot of thrill rides even though there are some outside the rides are mostly pleasant here and the lineswaits are long i found the folk museum to be a highlight of my visit it was beautifully done and almost empty\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "when search travel tipsguidelines in seoul the lotte world is always one of the mustgo attractions its a good place to visit especially when you are with the family also a good choice for young couples  similar to disneyland if not that big in scale kids can spend hours here while adults if not interested in amusement park can go shopping in the department store in the same building\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "i loved this place if you are adults go straight to the opened part or the park you will find many funny cool and even scared games but lines are every time weekdays too we came there around 3pm but it was enough to enjoy the most interesting attractions so you wont regret if you visit this park enjoy\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "lotte world is a place where dreams go to die and are reborn in mediocre rides and junk food the lines are long but the peoplewatching is fantastic i kept expecting the indoor part of the park to start falling apart at any minute  my wife and i were there for an entire day our first ride was sinbad  a subtle and horrific hattip to disneys pirates of the caribbean ride it was fantastically awful and when i was finally splashed by the water i expected it to burn through my clothes our second attraction was an insectrain forest mashup that featured lots of empty insect viewing cages and many children that perhaps should have been in some of those cages then we ventured outdoors for the real fun  of waiting in line for 2 hours for atlantis actually a pretty good roller coaster  the ride consists of going in and out of a manmade mountain and has two main runs again not bad however the other rides all 8 or so of them all had very long lines and we were getting cold so we ventured back inside  our finale consisted of a teacup inspired ride that had a large cobra in the middle and revolved just quick enough to entice the junk food our of your stomach not bad but perhaps a ride to be taken earlier in the day before food consumption  many of the indoor attractions and rides cost a little extra  this is a genuine piece of korea and while many foreigners might scoff at the rides and general condition of the place the peoplewatching is superb\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "overall a nice experience within a stones throw of the hotel in downtown seoul  liked best lots of rides for young children lines moved fasterwere shorter than everland which was a surprise on the day we went since the park is literally in the city park layout had the bigger rides for older kids in the adjoining adventure magic island so there is less walking from ride to ride  liked least 1 cost inside is high for what is available 2 some attractions inside are still extra cost even with the all inclusive ticket  tips 1 there are fast passess to use for the popular rides 2 food is expensive and limited in scope inside  there is a food court just outside lotte world in the connected mall ie hamburgers tacos if you need a lower price optionbut need to ask for reentry\n",

      "1 the mall is like any big mall in korea nothing special i think  2 my review is about the tower positive  outstanding view from the 117th to 121th floor about 500m  for that 1 point  negative  expensive adult 26000 won per person  it took more than 70 min to get upstairs all the procedures like security scan taking photos to sell them later just endless waiting in several rooms without a window the air condition was turned on in stand by modus there was just simply not enough refreshing cool air coming out of the aircon nobody of the staff cared you just were pushed through all the rooms like a herd of sheep there were no information about the waiting time if i had knew that then i would have paid the fast check in ticket which costs 50000 wonthis is outrageous expensive but in retrospect worth it of course first of all you must afford this price everyone who is able to do it should do it because when you stand in the queue for about 50 min and you see the fast tracker who paid more because they knew and they are passing through the middle line to the elevator then the damn legs are hurting even more and you are still not in the elevator because they skip the queue the waiting people have to wait longer maybe your spot in the elevator was taken by one of the high payers  show room was closed  the outside terrace was closed  the service and the staff processes have to optimize a lot i think  started at the end of the queue at 1630 to see the sunset we arrived round about 1745 in the 118th floor then it was dark night the windows are reflecting the inside light so the pictures you make are always with codisplayed with people around you  downstairs same procedure another queue the second one a little bit faster downstairs round about 45min but still too much time lost the sightviewing floors are big enough there was no hustle so the main problem was the one and only elevator of obviously 2 which was opened for the mass of visitors  the 2 walk with bottom glas view are not that impressive because you know you are standing on glas all the floor glasses are full of scratches  in the queue no sitting  conclusion lack of process optimization great view but just go there when you have enough time and air in your lungs or enough money in your pocket to buy you a fast lane ticket go there early enough to see the city by daylight and take some pictures without reflecting of the night indoor lights prepare it to the eiffel tower in paris it isnt that irritating like in lotte tower or the empire state building in ny there are timeslots there and you can buy the tickets simply online in english my opinion  to the operators this stay 2019 in seoul we decided to stay at park hyatt hotel but we had also considered the signiel hotel the best view was the most important factor in this years hotel choice next year i do travel to korea once a year because of my family it wont be the signiel again for sure\n",

      "this is a very beautiful building from the outside you can then take the ride up to the top for about 25 each give yourself at least an hour and preferably two hours it was not very busy when we visited but there are multiple queues that take at least 30  40 minutes to get to the elevators even on a slow period you can book ahead online to insure faster entrance the views are awesome and there is a glass floor this is a must do\n",

      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "this is definitely a must see location you have to get down in the basement that is to go up up up from the amazing plasma displays the architectural history to the phenomenal views this place is worth the trip we spent about 2 hours peering out of seoul sky and then a few more in the mall in seoul sky there are a few cafes a gift shop and a restaurant the views are spectacular it is worth the 27000 won for adults lotte tower does not allow you to make online reservations with foreign credit cards so get there early  cheers\n",
