15,Overall I loved it and spent several hours wondering the different exhibits Definitely give yourself plenty of time as I ran out as the museum was closing 
16,A solid history museum exploring all of Koreas military history but with a particular focus on the Korean War  Very much worth a quick visit      The inside exhibit space can be reasonably explored in under two hours but a careful

18,This is a fantastic musueum for anyone who is curious about the Korean War 19501953 As someone who knew very little about the Korean War I found the displays to be very engaging and the information to be very comprehensive Overall I 
19,Overall a pretty interesting museum with a good amount to see Free admission is a bonus as well Plenty of English signage so no worries there either At times though I was a bit put off by just how proKorea and at times even prowar 
20,11am and 2om English tour is a MUST It is an amazing museum but it was made memorable with the story telling and explanation from the tour guide I truly enjoyed my visit and I wish I have taken the guide at every museum I visit in Korea 
21,Elementary school kids have lots of interest in this part of museum which we visited with our kids and their history classmates Here you can see the preserved things from 1000s years ago 
22,So much history  excellent exhibits  This war museum in Seoul South Korea was such a great experience 
23,Came here on my last day and wished Ive come earlier There is so much to learn about the history of the Korean War and how they manage to defeat the invading North Korean forces 
24,I traveled to Seoul in 2018 was great trip i will share one of the great place i visited during my trip the The War Memorial of Korea a huge placebuilding with lots of great collections in and outa very interesting and really nice way 
25,This is a very pleasant place There are a lot of green spaces and tiny lakes The museum and exhibition are free There are outside areas to sit down and to relax and every statue has a description also in English 
26,Theres subtle bias and praising military but thats to be expected of most defense funded museums Good otherwise decent English info
27,Its a very great tour  spending couple of hours and got a huge information of Koreans War Some movies makes me cry and felt that I was the part of that War Salute to  soldiers Best place to bring our new generation to recall the 
28,Its one of my favorite museums It is the most educational museum I have visited It gives a great perspective on the Korean war The museum also has exhibitions about all other wars Korea has fought throughout its history The outdoor 
29,This museum is one best museums Ive ever been to It illustrates all the wars that happened in Korea and the emotional memories of people and how there is no winner in the war It has many sections inside and outside I really enjoyed my visit
30,When I visited in December parts of the museum were closed for renovations This included the Vietnam War wing and the section of outdoor displays that covered armour and artillery 
31,Some nice exhibits but slightly disappointing in terms of the overall collection  Focused mainly on Korean War between north and south with much less attention and artifacts from earlier ages  Lots of space allocated to artistic renditions and models with very few actual pieces
32,It was my second time to visit it  If you will really stay and learn every details of each monuments you will be touched of how the  world united to help Korea during their struggle Walking on the wall of roll will give you goosebumps from the long list of the names of the heroes who died during the war
33,Interesting memorial and museum to gain better knowledge in Korean history and especially regarding the Korean war and all the connecting events The memorial is very fine and offers a big open plaza Further there is a collection of old 
34,Very cool place They have a very wide range of artillery on the outside of the museum There are planes ships tanks jeeps and missiles aplenty I think kids will enjoy it specially 
35,I recommend anyone visiting Seoul to definitely check out the War Memorial of Korea I unfortunately knew very little of the Korean War but this Museum will give you a great tour and summary of the events We took the tour in English and 
36,It was an amazing place Inside of one of the ships you can see a 4D movie about an incident in 2002 at the NLD with great air conditioner and English subtitles Inside the memorial there are a bunch of things you need to see Also dont forget the third floor dedicated to the UN
37,Great museum to spend a few hours on a lacy day They have in and outdoor areas Everything is well translated into english Its free and you can even pick up a book with the detailed history at the tour exit

39,If you want to learn about the Korean war you should visit here There is no admission fee We can see lots of valuable exhibitions such as pictures movie clips and stories This history is still ongoing Thanks to lots of  people who 
40,I wish we all could only learn about war from visiting War Museum as the real experience would be so cruel We really enjoyed visit this War Memory of Korea I didnt know much about 
41,An impressive interactive museum for big and small It explains the war history of Korea and shows items from different periods of time inside and outside the museum Its really worth visiting
42,One of the best museums Ive been to around the world Excellent history of Korean conflict around the world and education of Korea 
43,Excellent museum that tells the story of the Korean War Excellent guided English tour My tour guide was 15 and as a veteran history teacher myself her presentation was A It is nice to know that Americans and other nations from the 
44,I love that the museum provide free English tour guide The person who was tour guiding us was lecturer and he was very informative The part that I like most is the 4D cinema where we can do simulation to Korean war A must visit place if you like the history of Korean war
45,I really enjoyed this museum that I came across while traveling on the local bus  Its free  So you must go  It gives you a history of Koreas soldiers and how the Korean war took place and the rebuilding of the Korea after the war  I am someone who do not like museums but this captured my heart  I felt for the soldiers 
46,This place is a must visit Tells you the story of the Korean War and different war strategies They have huge collection of arms and weapons used during the war There are also a few 4D shows simulating different situations during the war 
47,Very touching and emotional museum A must visit for travellers and locals Its a free museum and full of artefacts and screening explanations in Korean English Chinese and Japanese Allocate at least about 3 hours if you want to really go through the whole thing which is worth it
48,Great free attraction Free english speaking guide Shows and interactive exhibits which along with your guide paint a story of a countrys journey through time Not just a snap shot of korean wars
49,This place was a very sobering experience for me and I usually dont get choked up about war stories But the first statue from the metro station and the memorial stones really can get to you Definitely a sight to see in Seoul Bring tissues if you have a sensitive heart to what really happened here during the Korean War
50,This memorial is a remembrance of the Korean War and there is also a museum but we didnt have enough time to explore it We were able to go inside the dome structure where you can find a beautiful mosaic art inside There were also planes and army tanks outside but we were running short on time so I wasnt able to take pictures I would like to stay longer and look around more if I had the chance to return
51,Massive So much to see and learn There are quite a bit of English language signage but not as descriptive as the Hangul Its thoughtfully laid out and when I visited there were a lot of kids A really good historical overview with great collection of airplanes and tanks outside Deeply moving
52,This was the highlight of my visit to Korea The exhibits are quite extensive and are well presented The first floor contains exhibits from ancient times up until the occupation of Korea by Japan The second floor contains exhibits on the Korean War The third floor continues with Korean War exhibits and also includes Vietnam War exhibits and exhibits on the modern Korean army The weak point of this museum is its gift shop Every other war museum in the world that Ive been to has had a great selection of war related souvenirs and books This gift shop only has cheap souvenirs that you can find anywhere else in Seoul and there were none that were related to warfare at all
53,Very tastefully done museum  The focus seems to be on Korean war history in general versus specifically the Korean War  Not that it doesnt have a great exhibit on the Korean War which takes up almost half the museum  The rest goes from ancient Korean warfare all the way to modern ROK deployments The outdoor exhibits and building architecture are also great with stuff like a B52s and Soviet tanks  Its a simple walk from the number 6 line subway station Admission is free for the general museum  It offers tours in Korean and English  Almost all the exhibits have English and Chinese translations  Id recommend spending a good 4 hours here to explore all three floors  There are clean bathrooms with soap and toilet paper as well as a small cafe to get some coffee and a snack  There are free lockers they do take 100 won deposit however so you can store your backpacks and whatnot
54,Truly an awesome place to learn about the history of Korean War and showing honour to the people who had defended and sacrifice for their country There are also exhibits of planes tanks warship and others at open area of the building Best part of all its free
55,The War Memorial of Korea free entry is an important attraction dedicated to the Korean War which raged over the Korean Peninsula during the early 1950s There are six themed halls and a large outdoor exhibition area where you can spend several hours learning about the Korean conflict Note the museum is closed on Mondays  As you approach the War Memorial you will see several large outdoor monuments which set the stage for a educational it not sombre experience of visiting an attraction like this There are also numerous military vehicles planes vessels equipment in the outdoor exhibition area that are worth spending time to view before or after you enter the monument to explore the halls within  Exhibition rooms do a good job of presenting the war in a mixed variety of ways and medium; traditional text and figurative displays cased displays wall maps sounds of the war and even 4D experience of MacArthurs landing at Inchon In this manner there is a nice effort to make the memorial as accessible as possible to a younger audience who might not enjoy traditional war and military museums  At the War Memorial you will find expected lockers a cafe and gift shop at the War Memorial of Korea but no wifi unlike the various national museums you can visit around Seoul Photography is allowed throughout as well You can easily spend 23 hours here leisurely going through the exhibition halls learning about the Korean War  We very much appreciated our latest visit to the War Memorial of Korea This is one of those attractions that can have a real impact on visitors a place you want to return to during future trips to Seoul
56,The best museum that i have visited in Korea It is free to enter and has lots of exhibitions to see Different uniforms of the military throughout the years Warplanes and tanks all around Good place to understand the military history of Korea

66,While the war memorial is quite good and the museum is too I considered givibg this three or two stars due to the overwhelmingly loud and shrill school children who were chasing each oyher through the museum while also  doing there darndest to break all of the displays Where are the teachers chaperones and parents  I have a blazing headache from the sheer VOLUME inside the museum
67,It was heartwarming to see the hall of honor where the names of soldiers from different countries have fought for South Korea Not just in Korea but colonization was a part of the history globally  Memorials serve not just a collection of artifacts but as a reminder on how our forefathers fought for the freedom we currently have

372,This is an excellent place to visit The outdoor statues and exhibits are amazing and extremely well preserved Indoors I recommend taking the guided tours offered in English and Korean Its a huge place Its impressive how they show the victories and suffering during their history The museum goes back to 600 AD Theres a lot of kid activities on the lower level Theres also a place to get food and souvenirs
373,An excellent place to learn the history of the South Korean people and learn about Korea Outstanding history exhibits Inside the museum in Outside Museum An excellent place to take US soldiers and their families I found the museum to be one of the best museums Ive ever tour throughout my career in the army
374,You need a least 23 hours  Full of history  Planes  tanks  
375,This museum is a must for those who want to understand the story being the North and South Korea 
376,Great museum lots of fighters tanks a battleship And its free
377,It was a very large and extremely expansive museum To be able to walk the garden and look into the vehicles and go inside and see everything they have was a very humbling experience My Uncle fought in the Korean War and to be able to look at the things he spoke of was amazing
378,This was a beautiful place in the memorial was well done
379,One of the highlight of our Korean visit The museum itself is absolutely massive There are stunning display of war since recorded history on the Korean Peninsula The Korean war section did a great job of highlighting the horrors of wars No entrance fee is a huge plus too Expect to spend around 3 hour to see everything Overall this was one of the best museum I have been to
380,This museum is free of charge and is huge as well It also offers a good explanation on Korean history for a newcomer like me which was nice I wouldnt necessarily call it a children friendly museum but then again I dont have kids I also assume that the target audience is adults and not children so it really doesnt matter  All in all this is a great museum for people interested in Korea We visited this museum before we did a day trip to the DMZ This was very helpful as we understood a lot more of the tour guides explanation
381,Lots and lots of tanks and weapons during the Korean War and More
382,Beautiful I like how they have a section just for children respect for making it educational for all ages
383,Big museum vast collection of relics and information from the wars in Korea and entirely free of charge Highly recommend to those visiting 
384,Great place to understand Korean history will definitely take at least a whole day to complete Best if you already have some prior knowledge about ancient Korea and the Korean War if not go watch a few Korean period dramas and read your kids secondary school history textbook or you may find yourself either browsing through everything not knowing what is going on or spending an entire day on half the museum The monuments outside are pretty interesting as well and there is a collection of military vehicles at the side similar to the Vietnam War museum
385,A good place for visit very recommended
386,Expected to spend about 3 hours ended up spending 4 then coming back to spend another 2 hours the next day I kept having to marvel at how well done this museum is The exhibits are well sectioned into a few categories and each include a good mix of artifacts interactive media pieces and written information Would highly reccomend at least a quick stop to this museum for some context on historical and modern Korea The outdoor exhibit is very cool for kids or anyone interested in tanks planes helicopters or boats; first time for me to see many of these in person Would reccomend getting the app for English speakers as some of the exhibits were somewhat lacking in English information  the app is also very well done and even includes some AR elements
387,This museum is very well done and well worth a visit It is yet another museum in Korea which is simply a gift to its people and all those who are passing through It really did remind me once again if the horrors of the Korean War but it was done tastefully There is a lot of history besides the Korean War and it will prove interesting to all of the family There are movies and clips of historical scenes large ships cars tanks weapons of all sorts  We recommend the 4D experience as well but recommend a jacket since it gets cold with the freezing wind and fake snow Quite exciting  Youll probably want to reserve a few hours to visit here to see everything We stayed for over two and felt like we rushed through it
388,Very interesting place with lots of ear regalia and memorabilia Easy takes 23 hours to explore all floors
389,A wonderful museum that talks about the Korean War and the countries that helped it and there is also an Egyptian Archeology Museum that talks about the greatest civilization in the world
390,Sober place to learn about the Korean War Pity that there wasnt enough time for me to finish the whole place
391,This is a place that you must visit if passing through Seoul  They do not only have the history of the Korean War but nearly every other conflict the region has been in over the past 3000 years or more  It is a great history lesson and a great memorial
392,A great place to visit if you ever find yourself in Seoul All of Korean history is covered not just the Korean War although that does account for the majority of the large exhibits which include planes tanks  helicopters in the grounds Theres no entrance fee but an optional donation instead
393,This was one of my favorite places in Seoul I could have spent a couple of days walking through and reading about all of the history of Korea The artifacts are amazing and I loved seeing all of the planes tanks artillery etc outside of the museum Great place to learn a lot about Korea and a must see for anyone
394,You will need to make sure you take a few hours in your schedule to spend here The museum has a lot of fascinating exhibits with a lot of detail that you just wont want to miss A must see for a trip to Seoul
395,Amazing museum one of my tops of all time We thought 2 hours would be a good amount of time to explore but we couldve been here for another two hours if we werent kicked out at closing time  Its very well laid out with videos you can watch throughout  available in Korean English Chinese and Japanese that go in depth into the history And its free
396,Well laid out and has lots of exhibitions detailing the various periods of Korea  The Korean war exhibition is interesting to look at but the recount of events is more biased and proUS  UN than it needs to be A simple neutral recounting of the facts would have been appreciated rather than the nonstop rhetoric about how the UN is the defender of all freedom and US being the saviour of mankind
397,Interesting focuses on korean war and present skipping most of ww2
398,Great museum The English tours of the memorial and the museum are at 10am and 2pm Other times for tours in Korean too There are no other English shows The museum also has some 4d cinema experiences in there Theyre on about every 30 minutes Detailed description of the war with plenty of memorabilia within
399,I loved how ther preserved their guns aircraft and other relics
400,A mustsee if youre in Seoul Its a great memorialmuseum Lots of military hardware displayed outside Its very cool if youre into that sort of thing You can pretty much sit inon most of the military gear Great for photos And the museum part of it is also very cool Lots of history and historical significance of the most recent wars that have shaped this peninsula I think the admission is free if I remember it correctly
401,Great indoor activity with free admission As someone thats not a history buff I still found  it interesting to learn about Korean War history and the Korean War To go through thoroughly will probably take several hours There are displays of planes tanks and boats outside of the memorial which are also fun to explore A new exhibition had just opened when we went just after Christmas
402,This is the best place to learn about the history of Korean war The place is huge and full of information This is one of the most innovative museums I have ever seen The volunteer guides here speak so passionately about the story of the Korean war and the whole place shows the importance of peace in life
403,Very interesting and free It not only shows tanks and so on outside but the inside shows a range of inner Korean wars since around 1300 or so They are presented in a very interesting way including also videos and so on in English Also interesting for children if they speak English or the parents are willing to translate Would definitely recommend it Go from the bottom floor up in chronological order
404,This place is one of the best way to understand the Korean War If you are like me and have no background on the war this war memorial not only tells you what happened they also show you the official documents and if it was written in a different language theyd translate it to English just so you could understand Plus this place not only explains everything but they also do it in a fun way Id totally recommend you going here
405,Very good place the enter is free
406,very quiet place to go to relaax
407,I would recommend starting your visit in the morning and touring the outside first for a few reasons One there is a lot to see outside so youll be there for awhile if youre like me and are interested in all of it Second if youre not visiting during the winter then it is only going to get hotter as the day goes on and it will likely decrease the enjoyableness of being outside Once youre inside you can go at your own pace and rest when needed but youll have already done the outside tour Once youre done completely youre probably going to be hungry I dont recommend eating at the museum but walk a few blocks to NamyeongDong Its the closest area and they have a lot of options that arent touristy so youd be getting a more authentic experience in terms of quality delicious food
408,Very well done memorial with beautiful sculptures and old military vehicles and weapons to look at The museum was also very well done All the information was organized detailed and immersive Couldnt see everything in one day so Ill definitely have to go back
409,Great museum free entry to buildings and grounds that should not be missed in Seoul It is about 4 bus stops from Seoul Station and is very easy to get to  the bus stops right outside  It goes through the history of Koreas battles from the age of Khans to the Korean war and UN work It recognizes the work of Korea and their allies Great artifacts very well put together building and flow  The grounds have some amazing sculptures to look at and learn about There is also a very large number of tanks missiles and aircraft outside to look at They have a replica navy vessel  outside that you can go on board which shows the scars of an attack on it by North Korea  We went with 3 kids and they really enjoyed looking outside at the vehicles but also enjoyed the computers and artifacts inside all under 5 years old They have very nice baby friendly facilities  as well  Dont miss it
410,Lots of reviews on the museum itself which is impressive The childrens museum isnt quite as impressive but worth a visit with kids Still a lot of patriotic messaging but not more than you would expect Overall smaller than the childrens museum at the National Museum We went through in about 30 minutes At the end are two play areas My twoyear old was disappointed he couldnt go on the big structure with a slide etc Outside is another playground open to everyone  Entry to the museum is in 50 minute intervals On a Saturday in November it wasnt very busy but on a busy day you might have to wait
411,A must visit if you are in Seoul War Memorial of Korea showcases the history of Korea and also pays tribute to all the people who lost their life for Freedom At the entry of war memorial one would find the flags of all the nations along with their contributions who united together and helped South Korea in achieving freedom I would recommend joining the free guided tour of war memorial 10 am  2 pm The tour guide is a retired army personnel and he explained the history very well
412,A historical gallery with various segments of war which Korea was involved A great place to be to learn and understand as well as enjoying the environment around the area especially in autumn The souvenir shop offers a lot of choices from military caps shirts flags fridge magnets and korean small souvenir A suitable place to visit for family and friends
413,A thoroughly interesting museum Its a big place and will take up several hours of your day if you plan to see it all It is incredibly informative and the attention to detail is pretty amazing Sometimes you can catch the South Korean honor guard performing outside Theyre amazing to watch
414,Amazing museum with free entry The museum is expansive and comprehensive covering the various conflicts in Korean history The content is varied enough to be interesting throughout including interactive displays 4D movies and simulations etc The outdoor grounds also display a number or military vehicles which you can climb and get close to
415,For those who love history and war this place is best for you At the starting you will see the countries and companies emblem which have helped korea Its entry is free of cost The place is build beautifully with lots of animations and miniatures The place depicts each of the war  what is used how they fought The children come here and do there homework The place cannot be seen in a full day if you started watching everything There is smart guide available which helps you to study about this things
416,War memorial of Korea was an amazing place to see the past of Korea
417,A great experience in learning about Korean history not only about modern Korea battle but also back to when Korea was first founded  The overall experience can take between 2 to 4 hours although we stayed for 5 and still didnt finish Best of all its free and foreigner friendly with videos graphics and displays all available in English  A must visit for any tourist visiting Seoul
418,Well worth a visit a rainy day
419,Great activity to go and do Take the day off and go and explore this great memorial Lots of interesting artifacts You wont be disappointed at all Very good way to learn about the history of Korea
420,This war memorial was particularly impressive and beautiful The size was amazing and the exhibitions were really well done We spent many hours here there was so much to see read and interact with
421,Beautiful museum about all wars involving Korea although the Korean War is given a great deal of space Very detailed accounts Great use of multimedia exhibits artifacts and dioramas Most descriptions are also in English Many videos have 4 language options
422,This a spectacular place to visit it is Koreas thanks to the United Nations for their forces who fought against the North Korean invasion force The area is huge with a very large magnificent building portraying the history of the Korean people the ground are huge and include an array of armaments from the war including tanks boats and aircraft from both sides of the conflict including a B52 bomber  A must see the Americans and the British feature highly in the remembrance area as the countries who gave the most to the conflict
423,Got a great opportunity to spend a couple hours prior to closing at the War Memorial This was definitely an eye opening experience The museum is truly well done and provides a great overall history of the conflicts throughout the peninsula I only wish I had a few more hours to experience everything the inside and outside of the Memorial had to offer
424,One of the best war museums  memorials in the world Huge building and huge outside area with exhibits mostly from the Korean war in 1950s Very interesting setup interactive guidance and explanations lots of maps videos and models make you feel inside of the story Outside exhibition of tanks airplanes and other machinery used adds to the whole experience Truly mustsee place for any history enthusiast visiting Seoul
425,Great Tut exhibit even through level 4 social distancing Personal speakers available in two languages
426,I wish the DMZ tours would include this museum This place is very well done with a great presentation Most of the exhibits are in both Korean and English with some in Chinese and Japanese This peninsula has a long and interesting history and this is where you learn about it
427,Do visit and learn about the conflicts that have shaped the history of this great country
428,I first visited in 2010 and then again 2016 and it seems to have changed not for the better In 2010 the museum charged admission but the displays and exhibits were really interesting interactive and well designed  In 2016 admission was free but it looks like theyre doing renovations on a significant part of the interior of the museum and the remaining open exhibits were only soso compared to what I remember from my first visit The outdoor display of equipment is interesting
429,A mustdo in Seoul The displays were very modern and informative and there were English translations for everything There is the biggest display in dedication to foreign countries services out of any museum I have ever been to The staff were very friendly too You will find it interesting whether you know nothing about the Korean War or are well informed
430,Phenomenal museum Very detailed account of the Korean War The exterior is filled with monuments tanks planes and helicopters Good for all ages One of the best free museums Ive visited Takes a good 23 hours to get through
431,This is an amazing place to visit if youre even a little bit interested to learn more about Korean history Korea has quite a fair bit of war history and this museum presents it in a very digestible manner The exhibitions are amazing and you get to go up close to scaled models and even real military vehicles The recommended time is 2 hours but you will definitely need more than that if you want to see everything One thing to note is that the outdoor exhibition area with the planes and artillery vehicles dont actually close when the museum closes so if you want to maximise your time there you can visit the museum first then visit the outdoor area when the museum closes The outdoor area is definitely a mustvisit Within the museum there are also 3D and 4D theatres with fixed showtimes at intervals of 30minutes; they are well worth taking a look as well
432,Impressive building and detail maybe too much English tour guide had too much pride to share his knowledge and experience from different countries and times he did dwell on too much detail on some and missed general overview Though it may sound scripted but a well scripted overview and his glorious personal experience added would make it perfect your of the museum
433,Very interesting and moving museum  It was really nice to view all the exhibits and learn not only about the Korea War but all the historic war from the past  Outside there are couple of very moving sculptures capturing the Korean War and hope for reunification They also have planes tanks and a ship along with weapon from the Korean War  Inside is even better  Definitely worth a visit especially since its free
434,It has a ton of information based on the Korean War The only improvement I could see is the layout can be a little confusing at first glance It is a must see in Seoul especially for members stationed here
435,A really moving memorial puts into stark contrast the loss of war The museum was well worth a visit
436,Impressive Youll find a lot of war relics here Both from old and newer times A courtyard full of tanks and aircraft is what will immediately draw your attention If youre more into old time Korean warfare and memorial relics go inside of the museum It is free of charge and definitely worth a visit Recommended
437,Very good museum The most well made museum in Seoul
438,This is a must sea museum and memorial if you are visiting Seoul  Walk through Korean history in multiple exhibits While visiting the inside is intellectually stimulating a walk through the exterior corridors is a sobering experience as you see the names inscribed of all the military Korean US United Nations  members who died in the Korean War
439,The museum has exquisite collection of war machines Even if you dont want to enter the building you still can enjoy various tanks planes military vehicles even missiles  I love the big sculpture depicting brothers hug each other The museum promotes peace and unification between South Korea and North Korea
440,Wonderful museum that captures the imagination of the visitor with interactive exhibits Well layed out with many maps 3d models and artifacts Recommended for anyone who has served in the military This museum walks the guest through every stage of the Korean War Beautiful memories and planes outside the museum are also a must see
441,Fantastic museum  the writing on the signs and audio in the videos is all in English Korean and sometimes Korean and Japanese Plenty of indepth explanation of historical events with stories that were easy to follow even to a Korean history novice like me  The second and third floors are the best part with an engaging story with plenty of interesting imagery and personal artifacts Sometimes in military museums you get bogged down in facts and dates and numbers but this museum was clear interesting and informative at every corner I found myself stopping at every sign to read more The 4d cinema experiences werent amazing but the second video with a survivor of the war definitely made everyone in the audience cry  Finally the memorials and monuments are very touching with memorable quotes emotional musical displays and quiet areas for reflection  Overall I cant believe such a great museum was free Id go again and Id take a friend Have a try of the 4d cinemas if you have the time  the showings are every 30 minutes
442,This museum has both war memorials and occasionally other displays I visited recently to see the National Geographic Photo Ark display While the memorial is great by itself it is made even better when you can go and visit the unique displays it hosts There is a large outdoor section with military vehicles and a large inside section with history and museum displays
443,Really an exhaustive amount of information regarding Korean history From ancient times to the Korean war We tagged this on the end of a half day DMZ tour which meant we understood a lot more about what we were reading and seeing in the museum You could spend all day here if you are into your history
444,As many reviewers have said this museum is free of charge and it is giant It has 3 floors full of details on the Korean war When we went there it had a free copy of a book of the Korean war for free as well There are restrooms and you can entertain your children in the first floor where there is a playing area I strongly recommend visiting this museum as it shows in great details the war Also there are tours especially for children with a tour guide who makes the history fun to hear
445,Great history that can not ever be forgotten
446,Honors for those sacrificed for the country
447,I was completely surprised by just what a great museum this is It is far better than any other museum I have ever seen including the Smithsonian in Washington DC The attention to detail thoroughness of explanations and the quality of the artifacts and displsys are second to none I spent the better part of 2 days there and would still enjoy going back for more
448,If You are interested in tanks airplanes and war machinery then the outside exhibition is perfect for You Inside the whole history of military is presented with a lot of guns and other equipments Might be the most interesting museum I visited in Korea
449,A must see  Memorial statues are quite poignant and leave an impression  Museum part was very interesting and so much Korean history  They really cover everything and the exhibits were awesome
450,I loved it It was proud feeling because there some Indian soldiers had sacrificed their Life for Korean Soil
451,Excellent experience especially the exterior I would recommend spending as much time outside as inside The interior exhibit could use some maintenance dusting and several of the digital exhibits need maintence but still a must see when visiting Korea The National Museum does a great job of covering the history of Korea to include many military artifacts so if you are trying squeeze in both to one day you dont need to spend too much time on the 1st floor
452,This is a really detailed and well organised museum Lots of information thats well presented and follows the history of Korea If you are intending to go head early in your trip as the museum provides alot of context for what you will see  I spent around 3 hours here before I was museumed out and needed a break
453,One of the best place to visit in Seoul The place is huge entrance is free Outside nice park with impressive sculptures military vehicles used during war Inside a lot of multimedia presentations in multiple languages A lot to see so be prepared for full day
454,You can roam the area with no admission fees Be informed
455,This is the best war museum Ive been to They had a room that explained the history of Korea and its relationships with different parts of the world that was very useful There was a free video showing about General MacArthurs landing at Incheon that was a little videogame like and would be good for kids Spent about a third of the time there outside the museum looking at the monuments and airplanes on display
456,Great place to know the history of korea especially korean war
457,It means a lot to me in many ways Also I strongly believe a lot of people might be agree with me Various materials are provided for visitors in English Japanese and Chinese The most impressive thing to me was the hall of honoring soldiers who fight to death to help and protect South Korea Definitely a valuable place to many people regardless of race age and sex
458,Lots of great displays of Korea and their military I went for the aircraft but walked through the entire museum Free admission for most if not all exhibits A great place to stop by for visitors in Korea
459,Fascinatingly experience Could easily spend 6 hours here
460,Its been a while since I visited here but this was a really cool museum  The displays were in excellent condition and the turtle ship replica was great  Id absolutely love to visit again someday
461,Free entrance Very interesting and educational Interactive place with real videos and personal memories Museum where you can learn how much Korean people went through for all the wars they did not deserve Very sad histories
462,If you want peace remember war  So reads the center stone if the central plaza at the Korean War Memorial Simple truth but a great reminder of how incredibly relatively lucky we are to love in a time where war for most of us is only something we experience through history books  The memorial is a beautiful dedication to those who fought to make todays peace possible
463,We walked the grounds The sculptures are very moving perhaps one of the most touching memorials Ive been too The plains tanks and missiles were also a favorite of our inquisitive 3yo We spent more than an hour in the excellent and free childrens museum where everything is handson
464,A great way to learn more about the history of Korea The place is huge and if you want to go through all of the exhibits allot 3 hours The museum is free too Definitely recommend
465,Excellent museum One of the best war museums I have ever been to  Excellent historical displays and artifacts from many different time periods Felt like there was some anti Japan bias at times but the Japanese museums have some anti Korea bias so I guess its fair Seemed pretty accurate and had a lot of interesting things to see and learn Great for both adults and kids  Takes several hours to really see the whole thing Id go again next time Im in Seoul
466,Very beautiful place to visit 
467,Very nice museum that is well organized and has a lot of information about the history of wars in the Korean peninsula with an emphasis on the war between North and South Korea and the efforts of the participating nations of the world Theres also an outdoor exhibit of the large equipment used in the war planes ships and military tanks
468,Great museum Free admission and it took me a little over 2 hours to walk through at a slow pace The museum doesnt only cover the Korean War though it covers all Koreas war history throughout its existence
469,excellent exhibition of war equipments
470,This place is great whether you are a history buff or just a casual visitor looking to understand the tough times of the Korean War Leave an afternoon around 34 hours to really explore read and understand the exhibits as there are 3 rooms Korean War Room I II  III detailing numerous phases of the 2 year long war I especially loved the 4D experience where you are immersed in the thick of war based on veteran experiences Take note that the 4D experiences run every half an hour ie 2pm 230pm and 3pm etc etc as I missed one of the 4d experiences by 10 minutes There are 2 4D experience rooms visitors can enjoy Would definitely come again
471,An absolute must visit place while in Seoul Maybe even the top thing Id recommend seeing It is huge and you need a full day to walk around and see the whole thing There are many sections that tell different stories The statues outside are incredible too Also there are old war vehicles that you can go inside
472,Very nice humbling memorial
473,Impressive large with many tabas and aircraft
474,Awesome place to enjoy and marvel at the culture of South Korea Entrance is free and there is a ton to look at We were there for a few hours and we still missed a floor There are four floors of exhibits and a large outdoor exhibit which has the planes tanks vehicles and some boats from the World Korean and Vietnam wars
475,Rating based on the outdoor exhibit and childrens museum because did not have time to go indoor we arrived about 1pm Outdoor exhibit was excellent and you could go into the tanks and ship Childrens museum is free and admission is by hour and limited to 50 mins per slot You can only reserve slots on site There is an indoor playground before you exit
476,The memorial is free entry but Donations are accepted The place is big you might need the whole day to see almost everything They close at 5pm I really recommend this to anyone If you feel hungry theres a CU store close to the Memorial theres also a a cafegift shop for you to buy a snack A few restaurants across the street from the memorial building
477,A must see if in Korea  Awesome aircraft and boat displays inside and out  The hall of honor that lists all the KIA is sobering to say the least  3 levels with arrowson the floor to show the way  Just skimming through this place will take 4 hoursdo it right and its an all day event  They do have 2 small coffee shops inside but food selection is limited  A small gift shop is on the 1st floor
478,It was a rainy day and a Monday The building is closed on Mondays btw
479,Great place to visit We had a great tour guide There was so much to see We spent a whole day here and still didnt to get to see everything Do plan a couple days so you can take your time exploring
480,Inside the building you can experience some interesting facts about Korean War and in general Korean history Outside though you have a lot of awesome planes and tanks from the Korean War Yes you can touch them Yes  B52 is BIG Other notable planes  P4 Phantom P51 Mustang  There is also Sherman 5 stars for the exhibition outside 
481,I have been all around the world and been to many museums This is by far my favorite The collection of military vehicles aircraft equipment is incredible and in immaculate condition The museum is located just outside of the Yongsan Garrison US Military base and a 5 minute walk from the Dragon Hill Lodge You can spend an entire day here and want to come back the next day
482,I loved how they honor the heroes whoe fought the bravest battles in their place It was such a nice experience
483,Maybe the highlight of Seoul This place is massive with an extensive outdoor area consisting of a few sculptures plus a large selection of Korean and US planes tanks artillery and more Inside the museum they have multiple exhibitions about Korean history with a focus on the different wars waged over the millenia And the best is its all free It should be mentioned that the overall narrative of the exhibits about the Korean War are obviously presented from the South Korean viewpoint and might at some times feel a little onesided
484,One of the most impressive displays I have ever seen Its one of the only where I have seen a timeline that shows Koreas history with Western and Chinese timelines You really understand how developed the society was at the time
485,It is a good place to take foreign friends There is a history memorial hall and a memorial shop so it is good to see I think it is so great place to us and foreign You can check online homepage this month exhibition
486,A cool travel in time to know about the South Korean Story
487,It is temporarily closed nowadays due to Coronavirus; however you can still walk outside the premises enjoying the statues real planes and tanks and ships displayed feeding the fish in the pond
488,A large free museum covering an important subject in good detail It all feels quite dated though and not well curated lots of badly used space and bottleneck areas with the most interesting information Worth a quick visit between other things
489,Great exhibits detailing Koreas history of war Starts from ancient dynasties all the way through the Vietnam War and modern eras I wouldve liked to see a bit more detail about the challenges and intricacies of the war but the overall flow was still good
490,Its not first or last time visiting War memorial at Seoul National Cemetery As always it made me cry inside My own country doesnt have something like memorial of war Basically because we had so much wars in our history I live to visit there and I recommend it to everyone who want to experience similar thing like Jewish people are experiencing in one of Czech synagogue to memory all who died
491,Great place to visit to learn more about the various wars in Korea dating back to the 3 kingdoms as well as the more recent Korean wars The museum itself is great but be sure to check out the war machinery yard outside There you can come face to face with actual size B52 bombers Patton and T53 tanks as well as naval vessels and missiles It would be better to visit with someone who can explain the machinery and how it played a key role in tactical battles
492,about 15 min walk down busy parkway on foot cool old war planes outside extensive museum inside; couldnt see all in one day good showing of entire Korean history for the past 2000 years has a cold sterile feel inside not the best museum Ive ever seen
493,Great showcasing of various planes tanks missile and even a vessel You can even see a B52 The museum itself is a little boring as information is provided too slowly during the visit It probably takes around 3 hours to complete all the Korea war part
494,An extension of the Korean national museum Lots of overlap between the two museums If you are visiting Korea see the national museum If you are staying in Korea for a bit and looking for something indoors for half a day this is highly recommended Limited food options at the museum Small coffee shop with some premaid or microwave foods Better food options across the street
495,Really good to get updated on the recent and ancient hostories and wars that make up what korea is today
496,I was impressed by the scale and size of it Entrance is free Very informative
497,One of the best things about visiting Seoul Do not miss The average visit can run up to 3 hours but if you are the history buff it could go as long as 6 hours Closed Mondays 
498,A very poignant memorial to the events of the Korean war  With so many countries and people involved they did a great job documenting the horrific conflict and long lasting repercussions  The first floor shows the long and colorful history of all Korea and gives good insight to the issues of a split Korea
499, THE GOOD We went during a super hot summer day on a Monday when the museum was CLOSED for the day every Monday plus maybe Sunday  We were able to walk through the outside of the large granite buildings and also walked through the outdoor exhibit of military equipment like tanks artillery jets etc  I can only imagine what the inside was like but the scale of the entire museum grounds was super impressive   THE BAD I walked around the ring of honor style placates commemorating the different countries that sent soldiers to Korea to fight and die during the conflict aka war  I was surprised or not really that France sent a pitifully small number of soldiers like 700 soldiers while other much smaller and less developed countries sent so many more  Haha  Just a joking jab again the French   THE VERDICT Based on the super impressive scale of the grounds and because Im personally interested in oldfogey things like war museums I would definitely go back on a nonMonday and also when the weather is cooler
500,Lots of stuff to see Hundreds of years worth of tools and weapons The museums in Korea are well done English options for the videos The outdoor grounds were great too
501,Truly sobering Well put together great displays and very informative A great tribute to all those who fought Many nifty military pieces of equipment on display too Large impressive monuments scattered both inside and out
502,A great place to learn more about Koreas history and understand why it is what it is today Join the free english tour and youll definitely learn a lot A good place to take your kids Traveling is learning
503,There are so many details about WWI AND WWII history Its a lovely museum
504,Large abundant materials in each exhibition room Very interesting
505,Thorough explanations in different languages with English included Provides free guided tours at specific timing such as 1000hrs  1400hrs Able to see the progression of war from before Joseon era till the latest Korean War Has live size display of fighter planes and battleships Interesting and worthwhile trip to the easily accessible museum Grab a phamplet to optimize your tour
506,A very good museum that goes over all the wars in korea The museum will take at least three hours to get through There is no entry fee and a small Cafe on the first floor Plenty of English and tours are available during certain times
507,Interesting approach to armed conflicts on the Korean peninsula Exhibits covering the Korean War make up more the displays Scale  and full size models of the turtle ships and other war equipment make the museum a bit more interesting to children Labels include English name and some have narrative descriptions in English Pleasant coffee shop and restaurant on the grounds
508,A surprisingly large museum covering various wars that have involved Korea and Koreans Plenty to see here The relatively uncritical tone of some exhibits was a little jarring  but thats merely reflecting my western European sensibilities Definitely worth a visit if youre in Seoul for a few days
509,A must see for anyone visiting Seoul The free museum offers huge amounts of knowledge on Koreas history and especially that of the Korean war Knowing very little about it to start with I left with a much deeper understanding of the things that led up to the Korea of today
510,Awesome and there are free tours at 10 am and 2pm in English
511,If you want a great history lesson about the Korean War look no further than the Korean War Memorial  This place has so much history about the war and about other nations that it is mind blowing  I absolutely recommend this place to any history buffs out there
512,This museum is absolutely amazing I spent 2 weeks exploring Seoul and if I can easily say that this is the best day trip you can take if you into history The museum is organized by year so you can go as far as the prehistoric times You will see some of the coolest weapons available from assault rifles that bend to take shots behind corners to the atomic bombs dropped in HiroshimaNagasaki They even have an outdoor display of real war planes artillery weapons that span 23 stories tanks and much more The craziest thing is that it is completely free The museum is huge so designate at least 4 hours if not more If you have time split the visit in 2 days
513,I along with my daughter were honoured to visit my brothers final resting place at The United Nations Memorial Cemetery in Busan South Korea My brother Pte K W Norton was KIA Nov 51951 We were so pleased with the special care we were given A beautiful Country with beautiful people who are so thankful for their freedom An excellent second visit 
514,Incredible Museum we loved it However we wanted to try the Incheon Landing 4D Simulation but couldnt We waited for 20minutes but the racist worker did not want to let us in and decided to let 4 koreans before us and refused to listen to us It gave the experience such a bad taste we decided to leave so disappointing
515,This is a great place If you like planes and tanks there are lots of them on display outside even a b52  Huge complex with some impressive monuments  lots of interesting history well worth a visit 
516,Great museum with beautiful presentation Lots of history presented in easy to appreciate fashion Real artifacts scale models artistic memorials and a huge collection of planes tanks artillery and rockets

520,Great museum that can be done at any pace Lots of different types of exhibits as well as short videos military hardware artifacts etc Covers the history of Korea the Korean war postkorean war and other topics  Recommend at least three hours to see the whole place Free admission  Ditch the map Directions are very easy Follow the arrows on the floor and theyll take you through the whole museum If youre short on time its easier to walk briskly through areas following the arrows than navigate the different rooms individually
521,Very impressive detailed account of Koreas history defending itself through war over thousands of years The 1950s war is covered in a very professional exhibition Beautiful grounds to walk around outdoors and see the massive monuments
522,There is a lot of important and interesting history about Korea If you are interested in korean Worth its worth a visit Its huge so I only had time to visit the sections about Korean war No entrance fee
523,Free admission and free English guided tour  Awesome museum well kept with lots of exhibits  Also has a cafe for basic drinks and snacks along with a gift shop
524,It is a tourist place Obviously the location is crowded You will not have the real palace feel You are still capable of enjoying the location as one big photograph background since it is a marvelous architecture It is permitted to borrow a temple guards suit to have some pictures but only on a designated place
525,Interesting place to see for free The outside area offers a wide range of old war equipment to see which is interesting The exhibits are but conserved which is on one hand nice to see on the other its a bummer that it collapses
526,Great look into South Korean History
527,If you are Koreans Americans and anyone who likes history of Korean War you must see this museum  It is one of the most impressive museums I have ever been to and you can spend a whole day It is worth spending your time  It is located in Yongsan in Seoul
528,One of the best museums I have ever been to All of the exhibition had English texts and there was a lot of different types of static and interactive props This ment everyone could find something to do and like
529,Its very good place to know the history
530,Not only a memorial also a massive museum about the war history of Korea Most impressive is the outside exhibition which has hundreds of retired military vehicles boats and plains It is free to visit all that so no reason not to go
531,Seeing those tank plane and some other monument brought me back to the years where Korea  was fighting for their country I wish there would be someone who guide and tour us around this area This place is so cool That was the first place I went into Korea that I saw many foreigners D
532,I really wanted to know the history of the Korean War so I decided to travel here Its a vast museum with lots of artifacts from war exhibited inside and outside the museum This museum has 6 levels accommodate historical war during the kingdom era to world war and Korean War At the museum park you could see warships tanks and planes that were deployed during the war times Its really good places especially if you are interested in learning Korean War and how North and South was separated
533,Extremely interesting museum
534,Yes its a museum about war but it is such an excellent apace especially when its empty as it often is on weekdays Its always well worth a visit if you want to escape thw bustle of the city When it is busy its still not ao bad
535,Open free museum of military vehicule and plane
536,This museum is very nicely set up It goes through the very old history of Korea and all of its conflicts over the centuries About half the museum focuses on the Korean War but thats expected They did a very good job of showing their appreciation to all the nations that helped South Korea retain independence from the North Of course there are things that are biased in this exhibit but thats expected Be sure to stop by as its free so worth the visit
537,Well organized historical thing with Korean war with historical weapon system Well manged facility with outside exhibition
538,There is a magnificent building here which is definitely a museum You cannot be too marvel when visiting the facilities In addition to the incomprehensible history of their warfare There are other retired fighters tanks battleships and so on in the outdoors
539,Huge museum within a large area that displays a lot of memorials of the Korean War in the 50s The museum itself shows the countries history from the earliest age in until the 1950s It is really cool because you are able to deep dive into the Korean History and important wars conflicts with the surrounding countries After that you will understand why south koreans are relatively patriotic  Would definitly recommend it because the entry ist also for free but be aware that for some it might be an added patrotic touch too much
540,This place is amazing this war should never be forgotten God bless them all
541,A great place to learn about the military history of Korea
542,Very nice  views
543,One of the better museums in Seoul Its got a ton of good historical information that is relevant to visitors from many countries as many countries participated in the Korean war And outside on sunny days seeing the courtyard and the vehicles are fun activities added to the experience
544,Amazing memorial museum of the Korean War Did not know how immense the conflict had gotten in such a short time span Very awesome displays and exhibitions Will definitely return sometime as the special exhibits change However plan to start early as they close at six pm
545,Really informative museum It was interesting to see the massive history of Korea Last Wednesday of every month is cultural month which means free admission to museums and cultural areas However its quite cheap to enter here definitely worth the price
546,Very impressive and extremely clean I wish that I had planned to spend more time here I wouldnt call it a mustdo but it is a very nice way to spend a couple hours
547,Has to be one of the must see places in Seoul Lots of English and even some of the videos have a button to play them in English Well layed out and lots to see allow at least 2 hours and 3 would be better or you will not have time to take in what they went through Come out Metro exit 12 and walk along the road a bit to get to main entrance
548,Visited June 10th 2018 when a military ceremony was taking place The vehicles on exhibition to the east were great to look at particularly the boat shredded by bullets The exhibitions were insightful but the pinnacle of the visit was the turtle ship Looking forward to visiting again
549,Great Historic museum
550,Must see alot of history to absorb
551,Fantastic war museum it does not focus only on the Korean war but also the past wars with China and Japan There is a large display of military equipment used in the Korean war that is located outside which can be viewed after hours There are multiple exhibits on the Korean war and shows the progression of the war and different points of view I would highly recommend this place before visiting the DMZ zone it gives insight to the scale of destruction that occurred
552,Memorials of KIA soldiers Most world famous military equipment on open exposition Indoor exposition I havent a candle to light for KIA soldiers but I havent seen any burning or even standing Check if you can to light the candle and take one if yes
553,It was good but it seemed like there was a lot of glorification of war Does not show the real ugly side
554,This museum was great With a lot of exhibits covering war in Korea from ancient times to modern history The outdoor exhibition area has many tanks and aircraft as well as a recreation of a sunken boat from the second battle of yeongpyeong
555,I was spell bound by the detailness and enormousness of the data bn put up It rained heavily the day I visited so I wasnt able to see the outside exhibition but I was beyond satisfied by the amount of things to see Its free for public on all days Basically youll get a glimpse of the world history by the end of the end 
556,Good museum Peace and love
557,This memorial has an impressive number of all kinds of rockets tanks planes and ships used during the Korean War The museum is free of charge and the memorial hall in particular was very impressive to me Definitely worth a visit
558,Great place that commemorates Korea war Its huge monument in front and quite big building which is museum about Korea history and all the wars and conflicts that raged through this country over the centuries This is for sure the plaxe that you must visit when going to Seoul
559,We spent 6 hours inside the museum 2h per floor and we still havent visited the outside yet This museum is AMAZING So interactive Ive learned so much about Korea
560,Must visit memorial war museum Free close on Monday open from 0900  1600
561,Very good We should have allocated a full day to do it justice
562,Honestly I was there to see things pertaining to the Korean War and it was a very emotional experience The rest of the exhibits were interesting as well  From a USA perspective it is absolutely worth it just to see the Monument and the wall of names of the fallen
563,If youre a war Fanatics please visit the war memorial of Korea You got to see the t34 85 tank It has history from all the way from ancient Korean times to 1960s Korean Wars It was good to see some of the old cars that they had in the museum Plus its free not for parking parking costs
564,Its one of the most amazing war memorials around the world the detailed information provided over the war that SKorea fought is thorough also after watching the short film one truly realises the quoteIf you want peace remember war
565,A museum where much about Koreas ancient and modern war history can be learnt about Many replicas and models that bring history to life Extremely educational and the outdoor area is a nice addition
566,The War Memorial of Korea were once the headquarters of the Korean infantry This memorial is the largest war memorial in the world There are 8 main exhibits in the War Memorial The visitors can learn all about the Koreans war history by visiting the war history exhibit You may also witness how the Korean military developed over the years Different kinds of weapons and military equipment are exhibited as well The larger equipment were displayed outside the building Many of the documents such as files and artifacts of the war are preserved in the storage room in the memorial This memorial gives an excellent insight on the history and current state of affairs in Korea There are nationalistic propaganda here and there but its a reminder of the suffering and brutality of war and what many had to endure Inspiring of what South Korea had been thru and able to develop in fast pace in to a modern society and dominates the world in term of technology cultural and economy  This is an excellent museum to visit if you like military things and like to learn about Korean history Entry is free The memorial gave me a new perspective on who were all involved in the original conflict and also the fact that the war is not actually over yet and its actually on a long cease fire Outside the memorial is great if you like planes and war ships
567,Theres a lot of history in this museum It is well design and the collection provides a good perspective of the horrible impact of war to countries communities people and their families It serves as historical reminder of what it takes when peace is ignored
568,Impressive museum and a great tribute to those fallen in the Korean War Very informative and visual museum free admission Be sure to visit when in Seoul all the countries that fought in the war have their own flag with their native text in front of the entrance
569,This place is definitely worth the visit If I could only visit one place in Korea this would be it This memorial documents a part of the worlds history that every citizen of earth needs to remember so we dont have to repeat it
570,There is no glory in war only hate and pain for the ones left behind and the ones that remain Korea has seen more than its fair share of bloodshed sandwiched as it is between the two belligerent powers China and Japan What the Japanese did to the Koreans during their 30 some years of occupation especially to the women represents a gross injustice and is unforgiveable The writer of this review has been alive just long enough 47 years to know unforgiveable acts happen and the best anyone can really do is sit and endure the pain and count themselves lucky if theres someone to share the pain with them The Korean War Memorial is perhaps the most fitting tribute to the memory of the fallen and perhaps more importantly useful for us as the ones left behind should we or our children never know war first hand The monuments here are in a word spectacular The great bronze statues of soldiers and sailors are immense and the towering sculpture of an artillery shell has to be seen to be believed There are machines of war here too Planes and tanks and naval destroyers  many of them left behind by the United States after The Korean War The collection inside the building is extensive and you could easily spend a whole day here trying to take in everything  Or you could just see what you see and count yourself lucky that you came to such a place The sundubu jiigae beef soup from the memorial canteen is exceptional especially on a cold day and tastes particularly good when washed down with a cold beer Win or lose the memory of war is a two edged sword I hope Ill only ever know from a distance Worth remembering the first thing you learn in the Korean martial art Taekwondo is dont fight if you dont have to May we all find peace in our time
571,A must see for everyone who wants to know more about the contemporary history of Korea
572,Like the rest of the baby boomers I was a baby during the Korean War Once I became a teen Vietnam had taken over the news I knew that you the Korean War occurred but little else The outside display has a much of historic weapons and I was ready to say okay nice when I decided to look inside Wow there was very little of this country left un conquered when the American army arrived I stand in awe at the difference between modern Seoul outside and the scenes of devastation of only sixty years ago This was well worth a visit and much more interesting than the nearby National Museum
573,Wonderful for history buffs  There are both traditional and interactive displays  As a cool twist classical music is played in the outdoor areas You can waltz as you explore the tanks and war planes
574,Quite a solemn museum when we step into the Korean war section Unlike most war museums this also touch on the sacrifices of wives of war heroes who only get to be with their husband after death and were buried together in Korea Other than korean war part of it also covers the early dynasties military histories but those can be skipped if not much time
575,Army lovers would go crazy as there are lots of airplane tanks and truck Full list of guns and weapons showed Dedicated list of soldiers and countries involved at Korean war and truly appreciate the assistance for the current situation of South Korea
576,One of the finest war memorial which I have visited till date Should spend at least 4 hrs in this place to see all the exhibits and see the movie clips and also the 4D movies
577,Nice place to know and understand about the various wars happened in Korea  exhibits were very informative kids would have the outdoor exhibition which has airplanestankers and a ship there is also a small childrens museum  where kids also learn about war
578,One of the best museums I have ever been to inside and outside is just lots to see lots of cool 3D and 4D experiences it was free and just a great place to visit if not the beat place to visit in Seoul
579,Wonderfully detailed covers and informs all parts of the war including its buildup and aftermath  Deeply respectful and can really move you if you let it Its an honor to visit and pay respects
580,Easy to wander around but probably not that great as a museum This memorial is actually 90 a museum which is fine Its free and you learn the basics about the Korean War but dont expect to see the brutality of war here its more about charts facts and experiences Most of the content is in English It reminded us of the WWII museum in New Orleans which we disliked and less of the Memorial of Caen Normandy covering WWII and Dday which was the right style for our taste Fine of you find yourself with nothing to do before dinner Its a shame that such a BIG museum shows so little substance but we have become used to shallow historical context in South Korea whether its Joseon Dinasty or the Korean War who knows why
581,Great Museum Free admission Went on the weekend and the museum offered a very knowledgeable tour guide The guide was a secondary student who spoke great english and was extremely smart FYI I am a histroy nerd the guide knew his facts Guide was free too Recommend a visit
582,One of the most impressive museum in Seoul Its all about Korean War The museum houses approximately 33000 artifacts with about 10000 on display at indoor and outside exhibition halls There are six separate indoor halls including Expeditionary Forces Room Patriotic Memorial Room War History Room 625 Korean War Room Development Hall and Large Machinery Room The outdoor exhibition hall showcases largesized weapons Absolutely must visit museum Reserve minimum 3 hours to see all exhibits Guide Course 1000  1100 1400  1500 free Closed on Mondays
583,One of the most impressive war memorials I have ever seen Outside of the building is a physical military museum  equipment from the Korean war 19501953 The building itself is impressive from the enormous plaza to the exhibit areas There are displays that trace the history of various conflicts that the country has encountered for the past 1000 years The displays are well done an interesting There is a replica of the turtle boat uniforms from the nations that fought for the independence of South Korea and much more  The most moving part of the memorial are the long halls with the black marble plaques Each plaque list names of those that died in defense of the country  33000 names It is somber sobering and very moving
584,A 5 Stars most visit museum when in Seoul Yongsan area Very close to the base gate 1 actually walking distance 10 minutes or less Most complete history of South Korea Early Korea Japan domination and constant battles with his neighbors to include China
585,Very extensive and immersive history as well as tons of exhibits The information is vast and well organized Great place if you wana learn more about Korea s history English translation on the descriptions too
586,Great Historical museum A must see for the history buff They also have English guided tours if you do not speak Korean
587,The memorial holds a large free museum but all presented as a timelined story It doesnt feel like a museum at all instead you follow the experience from the backdrop of the war through the invasion UN resolutions counterattacks and eventual ceasefire Its a fascinating story brought to life with a mix of films models and of course artifacts from the war Reminds me of the Gallipoli war museum Peter Jackson designed they dont feel like stuffy old museums one bit
588,Its really quite scary how many people died in the Korean war this place really brings it home every name is displayed on the wall around the memorial Excellent artifacts and testimonials contained in the attached museum as well
589,Great place to visit There is a lot to see outside the actual museum
590,I came here when it was closed and still has a blast looking at planes boats and tanks

592,I learned so much
593,Great place to know about history
594,Beautiful museum covering the entirity of war on the Korean peninsula The most trafficked areas are the Korean War halls on the main floor but their are many great exhibits throughout the rest of the museum The main floor halls focus on Korean and US involvement and the general timeline of the war The third floor has a hall focusing on the contribution of UN forces to the war effort
595,Wonderful museum close to Samgakji subway stop Have visited this museum dozens of times I always bring visitors and family here when they vacation in Korea Admission is free Lots of great pictures with all the national flags and Seoul Tower behind
596,Make sure you allow plenty of time to view it fully Well organized and takes you through the history of the region which explains current political conditions A must visit for anyone interested in history or politics
597,Where You Feel the Importance of Freedom
598,The War Memorial is a must see if visiting Seoul  Would recommend visiting in fair weather as there are quite a few static displays located outside including a full size mock up of the ROKS Cheonan
599,The Korean War memorial is informative and has a few 4d exhibits which I found highly interesting The memorial really helps you understand what Korea went through during the Korean War
600,The ultimate sacrifice is never forgotten  A moving tribute to those who came to the aid of a country most had never heard of but were all willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for True heroes of our time Few are still around and ALL deserve the never ending thanks and admiration of this  thiving nation
601,Visited this place out of respect of all the people who fought during the Korean war Especially my grandfather who did two tours and came home to share his story to inspire me that freedom is not for free
602,This is a fantastic area to know about Korean War The history of Korian war presented here by smarter way Name of war hero has been conserved here The weapons  fighter planes also conserved here Every body should visit here who visit South Korea

606,Incredible Museum that is free to the public Still open during Covid
607,As war museums go this was all the encompassing for the Korean Peninsula Korean friends back home stressed that we must see this Well there is a fair bit of jingoism here and I can see why Koreans feel strongly about it If stressed for time this is a miss
608,A must see to learn about korea
609,What a great museum There was a ton of information available in multiple languages throughout with lots of videos and graphics Very well organized and easy to follow through everything I learned a lot
610,Its an enlighting experience Coming from Canada Ive only ever heard a small fraction of what happened during the Korean war this museum paints a more complete picture of what actually happened and why The museum covers all of Koreas various conflicts thoughout history afterward youll understand why there is still lingering animosity between certain countries and a lot of good will between others
611,It is a great place to visit The Memorial presents the history of Korean War in fascinating way A lot of technical stuff is presented One can spend a whole day there
612,Very good exhibition and English guide
613,Setting aside the kimchi theres need to see the memories of war From the War of the Three Kingdom to World War II it is amazing and very informative With English Korean and Chinese as languages to select from theres no reason not to learn something on this place
614,This Museum is the size of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum but is dedicated to war Not just the Korean War in the 1950s but of the more than 70 Military ConflictsWars Korea has been in The Korean Peninsula is fertile land and ChinaManchuria Russia Mongolia Japan France United States Great Britain have all tried to control Korea But the Korean people are very strong and have their own destiny to follow Unfortunately world powers try to use the Korean people as pawns But the Korean people are too strong for that Korea only gets stronger Korea will alway win
615,This place is very expansive as it contains both indoor and outdoor exhibits Outside has plans boats tanks among other large pieces of military equipment from the Korean War Indoor contains models and artifacts from other wars in Korea from throughout history Signage is in English

617,Beautiful free museum Lots of history about Korea during war Very interesting Outside of the museum are tanks submarines and planes used during war Cool place to check out near Itaewon
618,It is a good museum in Seoul If you come with children I recommend there It is convenient to take subway and get off at Samgakji station but I walked from Itaewon so it was a little far
619,As an active ROK soldier and grandson of a Korean War veteran I thought this memorial was well made The location of it is near Itaewona great place to stay and enjoy nightlifeThe memorial used to only give Korean curators back then but now they provide English Chinese and Japanese The memorial also had all the relics from the Korean War So if youre a huge fan of war history i recommend spending a half day here Youll get a chance to understand why South Korea and North Korea are still at war In the meantime i will be protecting the country Hope you have a good time  Tip Try to visit the memorial during weekdays during your vacation Theres a lot of other events going on at the memorial during the weekends And once you visit hereplan a trip to the 38th parallel Thats where you can see some serious stuffs there

630,Great introduction to the Korean culture and the Han people  I recommend you come early  as it can take all day or more to view everything Most displays are translated to english
631,Every country has their own war story For South Korea they still live in it See the museum made me aware on how terrible the impact of physical war but it will become even worse when technology will be used for it May Allah protect all of us
632,The animations are a good effort Better museum than the National Museum If u want to visit a Korean museum  have time for just one choose this

638,This museum explain mainly the Korea war but not limited to Nice presentation and you can enjoy free guided tour in different languages

659,If you have children this is the one time that I would suggest that you take the guided tour The tour is short and the guide will direct you to some 3D theaters that you may unknowingly walk past
660,I found the exhibits to be interesting and appreciated the English translations of the explanations It is a pity that part of the outdoor exhibitions are closed for renovation works until January 2020
661,Cool collection of planes and tanks  Nice plaques honoring nations that fought the war and those who lost their lives  Exhibits on the war itself are overly simplistic and geared to an immature audience
662,The history of Korea is that of hardship and rebuilding  To think that 60 years ago this was a completely different city and country and what Korea has gone through to get to where they are is impressive This memorial and museum is a lasting testament to that
663,This history told by this place is incredible With the fixtures out the front in an open air style museum to the incredibly detailed rooms walking you through the history of war
664,Thought this was just a memorial for the Korean War but inside is the history of war in general for the nation They start from 4000 BC and go until now Quite fascinating and impressive
665,If you enjoy history this is a must They have very good guides explaining the displays and it is really worth the time youll spend there
666,Very nice Look like they have some construction going on but didnt impact my visit  Need more than a day if you really want to look at everything in detail
667,This is a pro american museum History is written by the winners  why would they tell us the war crimes they commited on the korean soil Or tell us the war crimes South Korea did I can understand why they are blaming everything on the ennemy but thats not what history is and should be but Im pretty sure the korean war museum in north korea is the same but with the roles inverted But this museum is not entierly a waste of time
668,Come ready to spend a day or more  Well organized and informative  Museum is great if you dont know  speak hangul as much is in English as well
669,Amazing place and a must see if you like your history Big plus is most of the museums in Sth Korea are free
670,This is the most impressive most well thought out and most well presented war memorial museum i have ever been to I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes history technology art or military machinery
671,The best place to know history about korean war Its only in the war memorial museum that my country the Philippines was the third country to help south Korea during this time of conflict 
672,Excellent Must VISIT
673,While having an impressive show of military hardware and giving a mostly accurate description of the actual Korean war the Memorial falls short on the political and historical background with a rather onesided view of the events and should not be your only source of information A much more accurate description if you read only one book on the topic would be Bruce Cumings The Korean War available from the major Seoul bookshops
674,Very well done and comprehensive look into the history of Koreas major historical conflicts including the Three Kingdoms era independence from Japanese colonial rule and the Korean War Definitely worth a visit if you have even a mild interest in history especially since its free There is a large collection of war machines both inside the various exhibits as well as outside including aircraft tanks and a replica of PKM 357 which was involved in the Yeongpyeon skirmish in 2002
675,Because in San Jose since 2 year old 2002 Evelyn Avenue San Jose California 95122 Ive never been so teared up when Gaurdian Angel is The Motive as Innocence Hydro Planes into all the Teary Eyed
676,Very informative and nicely detailled
677,Plan at least a half day to visit this museum to learn more about the war Nice exhibits with many weapons on display Highly recommended
678,Great place to visit quite large and free The outdoor display is fantastic as you can touch an feel all sorts of tanks planes and guns
679,Well stated war zone  State of the art keeping 
680,A moving museum that pays tribute not only to the South Korean people and ROK forces but to all of the UN forces involved Plan for a lot of walking Our visit took just over 4 hours
681,Time your visit to the tour Good to hear about the Korean War from perspective of a local S Korean Fascinating how US and China effectively used the two Koreas as proxy pawns
682,Its one of the most famous site of Yongsan District in Seoul You can see overall about the Korean War And near by theres good park
683,My dad fought for the UN in Korea in 19511953 I was pleased to be able to see the  contribution of the UN force acknowledged Very very good museum
684,It was memorial place took us to Korean war in the past where many nations involved and peoples died We can learn war only lead to misery good heroic museum
685,Probably the best exploring day I had was in here Ive followed the Korean history for a little while now but I learned so much here great spot A must visit for all
686,We spent nearly half a day at war memorial It was highly informative enabling us to know the history of korea The AV depicting the war scene were realistic
687,War memorial with names of troops died in Korean War Inside is museum where you can see the uniforms guns canons tanks planes that were used in the war Also some more from the Japan invasion Korean Empire Joseon and Goryeo Dynasty You can watch the movies and animation version of some war Theres a hall dedicated for UN
688,An extensive collection of planes tanks and artillery of both Koreas Quite impressive and accesible The only con an understandable one is that as the conflict is still present sometimes it feels too patriotic skimming propaganda
689,This museum has great exhibits  both indoor and out  and is a very interesting presentation of conflict on the Korean peninsula throughout history  but particularly the Korean War in the 50s
