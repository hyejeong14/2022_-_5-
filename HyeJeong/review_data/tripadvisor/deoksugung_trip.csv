4,4,CulinaryConsultants,5.0,There is a common believe that most South Korean Temples look pretty much alike and that is an undeniable truth Nonetheless there is a hidden differential beauty on each one of them Here at this temple we could appreciate the differences  This palace also has a lot of dynamic history as has been occupied not only by the Korean Royal family In 1897 after the incident when Emperor Gojong took refuge in the Russian legation he returned to this place and named it Gyeongungung again During the Japanese occupation of Korea in 1592 the residential buildings became a temporary royal residence after all the other palaces were destroyed by fires  Many of the structures here have since been removed or sold In 1933 all buildings except for a few central and western style buildings were removed It was then made a park and opened to the public  At the end of the trail you may walk youll find a turquoise Blue Fountain European looking On the left of this you will find a smaller part of the palace detached unit and on the right of the fountain youll be right in front of the Deoksugung National Museum of Modern  Contemporary Art  Its important at the door to purchase the full package ticket so that you can appreciate both Palace and Museum  Since 2007 restoration work to restore Deoksugung Palace to its original specifications  This work has been ongoing We do recommend extensively this palace although we couldnt appreciate the full beauty as it has been a bitter winter this January but in Spring must be definitely wonderful  Dont miss it,"Written January 29, 2020"

47,47,Rumples,3.0,I liked Deoksugung the least of Seouls five grand palaces Thats because its myriad buildings present a mishmash of neoclassical Western and traditional Korean architectural styles A palace since 1593 Deoksugung took on a new look in the early 1900s when King Gojong instituted a program of modernization and reform In addition during my October visit a wall enclosed a large portion of the grounds further detracting from a cohesive whole Construction work was under way with windows in the wall revealing only dirt and construction materials  I found the buildings interesting to look at separately especially Jeonggwanheon Hall a fusion of Western and Korean The king drank coffee here and entertained guests This small structure features a verandah and metal railings and fits in better with the Korean halls than with the massive Western buildings One of the latter now holds the Daehan Empire History Museum and another features the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art  I came here on a weekday to watch the changing of the guard at the entrance gate and stayed to visit the palace itself The guard ceremony proved to be absolutely spectacular with at least 50 participants dressed as Josenera soldiers and bandsman in vivid yellow or brilliant shades of purple The ceremony lasted about 10 minutes with a woman describing what was happening over a loudspeaker in English and other languages She then invited spectators to approach the soldiers to take photographs  Excellent free brochures about the palace are available in English Information signs most with details in English exist throughout the complex and tours are available in English The admission fee for adults is 1000 KRW about 1 US,"Written November 12, 2018"

149,149,Myo M,4.0,Being the smallest one among the four palaces I got to in Seoul not sure how it compares in size with Gyeonghuigung which is the only one that I didnt get to among Seouls five palaces this is not a palace like Gyeongbokgung which is kind of a world of its own with its huge grounds where youll get an immersion experience of the Joseon era days but what this palace offers just because of its significantly smaller grounds compared to Gyeongbokgung is nice contrasting views of traditional palace buildings  their modern highrise counterparts right outside the confines of the palace grounds including the interestingshaped allglass structure of Seoul City Hall which can be seen from the raised platform around the main palace building which will kind of give you an idea how far Korea has come from those days of the Joseon Dynasty And those relatively small grounds of the Palace actually merge on one side to the left of the main palace building while facing it or equivalently to your right if you go all the way to the end of the pathway from the entrance gate after coming in from the street with the grounds of a big museum with a lovely fountain in front although Im not sure if the museum is considered part of the Palace for admission purposes or if it can be entered from another side  And unlike at the other palaces the main building of this palace can be entered not just to look at from right outside so you can get a closeup view of the throne stage Also present here at the entrance gate are two or three ceremonial guards didnt see them on the way in at about 10 am though only saw them on the way out about an hour later but Im sure theres no big ceremony involving a lot of guardsmen in colorful attires with some holding beautiful flags as at Gyeongbokgung since theres simply no space here for such a ceremony  Coming by subway City Hall Station Lines 1  2 is where to get off and youre pretty much right outside the Palace once you get out of the station onto the big street Sejong Daero just a 1to2minute walk to the entrance gate And what I suggest for the ticket is getting an integrated ticket for 10000 won the equivalent of 10 US dollars which is good for like a month and which gives you admission to four of Seouls five palaces except for Gyeonghuigung which Im sure is a small one maybe even smaller than this one  Jongmyo Shrine; also do keep in mind that this palace along with Changdeokgung  Changgyeonggung are closed on Mondays whereas the main palace Gyeongbokgung  Jongmyo Shrine are closed on Tuesdays,"Written January 17, 2017"

402,402,kjmagnuson,5.0,Deoksugung is important for two reasons it become a royal palace following the Imjin War and was breifly the primary palace until Changdeokgung was rebuilt in the early 17th century Second near the twilight of the Joseon dynasty Emperor Gojong used the palace as a refuge after the brutal murder of his wife  The palace itself consists of roughly 13 of the structures that once stood within the complex The palace is not as beautiful and wellpreserved as Changdeokgung Palace nor as grand as the largely rebuilt Gyeonbokgung Palace Yet I really enjoyed my visit for both the history and pleasant atmosphere within the palace grounds There is one unique feature of Deoksugung the European style palace structure that stands out rather prominantly  For those interested in Seouls dynastic past the first palace you should visit is Changdeokgung the second should be Deoksugung,"Written November 28, 2012"

410,410,MrMin,3.0,My wife and I visited Deoksugung Palace one icy cold afternoon It was in walking distance from our hotel in Myeongdong although I later learned that it was also just one station away The palace is probably the smallest or one of the smaller in Seoul but we found it romantic The grounds were very spacious and full of trees and the architecture was colourful as with other palaces Not much to see to be honest other than a few palace buildings and the changing of the guard ceremony But there is an museam inside the palace ground that provided interesting viewing and respite from the freezing cold There is also a lovely walk around the outer walls of the palace that we thoroughly enjoyed During that walk we had a fantastic lunch at the organic restaurant that is located at the theatre If you time your visit to the palace well you can follow it up with this walk late lunch at the restaurant and a theatre show So Deoksugung is okay on its own but great and conveniently fitted in as part of a walk of the area Do it,"Written July 11, 2012"
411,411,Lester Jeff B,5.0,Deoksugung Palace as has been said in other reviews is one of the smaller palaces in Seoul But it isnt any less of an experience to visit By having relatively smaller grounds you can walk the entire complex in an hour to an hour and a half seeing all the beautiful architecture from Koreas history But take some time to really experience the surroundings and stroll through the grounds featuring beautifully kept open spaces gardens and walking trails alongside the stunning buildings It was quiet and peaceful even as more visitors arrived we went around 10am The Museum of Art located within the Palace grounds is also another great plus of visiting here  But the main attraction was definitely the Changing of the Guards ceremony The colors and the sounds from the likely hundred or two individuals acting out the ceremony are a musthave experience when visiting Seoul After the ceremony the guards and royal officials remain outside the Palace for you to take photos with them A highlight of the experience is the opportunity for you to dress up in traditional Korean clothing for free A tip dress up before taking photos with the guards Makes your souvenir photos that more special,"Written July 8, 2012"
412,412,Kah Han T,3.0,Its one of the smaller palaces out of the 5 in Seoul but it is still worth the time to visit entrance fee is 1000 won Although the interior of the palace is not as elaborate as the rest there are still things to see such as the royal change of guards ceremony I caught the first one at 11 am If you are up to it you can also experience being a guard as they allow visitors to try on the royal guard outfit for free The booth is situated outside the palace Being a smaller palace does have its own benefits as you can escape from the hordes of tourists that usually visit the bigger palaces The whole place is serene and calm and can be a good place to relax while learning about the history of the palace,"Written July 3, 2012"
