GiorgiaPellizzari,5,"Insanely good Tiramisu¡¯!
As an Italian, I¡¯m picky about my Tiramisu¡¯ and let¡¯s admit it: I didn¡¯t really go to Seoul to have one.
Anyways, besides the lovely location, the fridge full of Tiramisu¡¯ outside Two Sizes did the trick and we went inside to have a small pistachio Tiramisu¡¯. The girl behind the counter - Zarina - was beyond nice and...was Italian as well! The shop started in Rome (I had no idea) and just opened its location in Seoul. The Tiramisu¡¯ was phenomenal.
We had three: pistachio, original and strawberry.
It¡¯s painful to admit but this is better than my grandmother¡¯s Tiramisu¡¯ and the pistachio one is unbelievable.
If Tiramisu¡¯ is your thing, don¡¯t miss this place!","October 12, 2019?"
ChunChunMaru,5,"One of the best outside of Italy?
The tiramisu at this place is simply awesome. Comes in 2 sizes and several flavors.
You can either eat at the shop or have it as take away. As take away the staff will pack the tiramisu in a box and if you have a long commute they will add a small ice packet to keep it fresh.
The shop is not on the main street so look for it in the small side alleys.
I got the original and the pistachio when I was there. It was recommended by the very friendly young lady working there that evening. And it was a great recommendation. Both was really great and everything was just perfect. It didnt feel like whipped cream on top of sponge cake dipped in coffee like so many places sells this dessert but it was like a true artisan Italian dessert only found in Italy. After eating the tiramisu here you will understand why this dessert is so popular.
Also cudos to the young lady working there who was really friendly, spoke fluent English and made it really pleasant to buy tiramisu here.
My only regrets after buying from this place was that I only got 2 small sized ones instead of two big ones and that I left Seoul the next day so I couldn't go back.","October 6, 2019?"
Cskflsk,5,Really good and real Tiramis? just like the one in Italy!,"September 22, 2019?"
Benyun,5,"Delicious Tiramisu and coffee
The tiramisu was really delicious, and I'm usually not a fan of desserts. I was with friends and we sampled most of the flavors. Everyone really liked the original and pistachio, but my favorite were strawberry and peanut butter. They also use a brand of coffee from Italy that is hard to find, but when I tried it, it was strong with a nice acidity which is perfect for me. I highly recommend a visit.","September 10, 2019?"
