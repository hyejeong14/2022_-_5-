62,62,Vincent M,5.0,There are three great cultures in East Asia Chinese Korean and Japanese For at least the last two millennia Chinese cultural influences radiated out to both Korea and via Korea to Japan Westerners sometimes dismiss Korean art as imitative but thats not true You might as well dismiss Italian Renaissance painting as simply imitative of Flemish or Romanesque architecture as simply imitative of Roman Each of the Far Eastern national arts is unique and excellent But I suspect even those with a strong interest in art and culture are far more familiar with Chinese and Japanese than Korean So in terms of delving into artistic and cultural terra incognita we Westerners would get more bang for the buck in the National Museum of Korea than in either the Imperial Palace Museum in Taipei or the National Museum in Tokyo All three of these museums are overwhelming but Koreas fine arts are the ones most likely to be a terra nova  You could spend a full day at this museum standing in line when the doors open and being ordered out when they close and still not absorb it all I was astonished to see TAs suggested duration as \xe2\x80\x9c2 to 3 hours\xe2\x80\x9d but felt better when I checked and saw their suggested duration for the British Museum was also \xe2\x80\x9c2 to 3 hours\xe2\x80\x9d In fact cheer up curators of the NMK TAs suggested duration for the Louvre is \xe2\x80\x9c 1 hour\xe2\x80\x9d The curatorship of the NMK by the way is as outstanding as its collection which was good news for me I needed all the help I could get Here are just a few things Id recommend you look for  Plug Em and Pot Em We do a lot of odd things to our dead Egyptians mummified them; so did Chileans Zoroastrians put them out for the buzzards to eat; so did Thais long ago Eating them was the norm in New Guinea New Zealand and the Amazon But as you wander through the NMKs collection of Three Kingdoms artifacts 4th5th century CE be on the lookout for some huge red clay pots Baekje honoured their noblest dead by jarring them My mother used to preserve stuff in jars too but it was apples and apricots not ancestors See Burial Jars photo  A Really Old Boat The bestknown boat surviving from antiquity is the Khufu boat which has an entire museum to itself a baseballs throw from the Sphinx in Gaza Its over 4000 years old and remarkably wellpreserved but was built strictly for mortuary purposes and never even got wet The NMKs got a real boat thats twice as old 8000 not 4000 You get to see what little remains of it and a recreation A humble canoe; no Pharaoh would have dreamed of stepping into it but it would be thousands of years later before Pharaohs were even invented Im not sure wed even gotten to antiquity yet when some stoneage Korean carved this canoe Korean fauna back then included cave lions and woolly mammoths I suspect the canoe hit a rock got holed and was abandoned by its owner as a nowworthless piece of junk Little did he know that people would line up and pay good money to see it 8000 years later see Neolithic Canoe photo  Buddhas Explained Naturally the NMK has a large collection of ancient Buddhas Ive mentioned the NMKs outstanding curatorship I particularly commend them here Ive been to national museums in China Japan and every country in Southeast Asia and this is the first museum Ive seen seen that explains each and every mudra Whether theyre giant Buddhas or miniatures all Buddhas do something with their hands Each hand gesture has a specific meaning but if you dont know Buddhist signlanguage you cant read them The NMK provides you with an easy 10minute course on what each one of them means immeasurably improving your understanding and appreciation of what youre seeing After six years of wandering around Asia I knew a few of them but now I know five times more A healing Buddha holds a medicine ball in his left hand and not only heals folks but saves them from calamities in both Pure Land or Theraveda Buddhism the \xe2\x80\x9cgoddess of mercy\xe2\x80\x9d Guanyin does the same and she also holds a bottle of medicine see Healing Buddha A different gesture indicates that the Buddha is dividing his disciples into nine different grades depending on their religious capacity see GradeMaking Buddha The star of the collection however is a pensive Bodhisattva one of the National Treasures of Korea see Pensive Bodhisattva The museums also got a brilliant 5minute video on the building of one of the UNESCO world heritage site Buddhist temples in south Korea broken capstone and all Every NMK video is worth watching  Other National Treasures Korea has an admirable system for identifying its finest cultural treasures Youll find quite a few of them in this museum National Treasure 61 NT 61 is a 12th century dragonshaped celadon ewer see Celadon Dragon;

951,951,savvyworldtraveler,4.0,The National Museum of Korea is the largest museum in the country and definitely worth seeing even if theres a lot of similar stuff I had already seen at other museums including the National Palace Museum at Gyeongbokkung as well as the National Museum in Gyeonju; this one is the biggest and has the most comprehensive sweep of Korean history and culture Its large but you can probably do the museum in around two hours not including special exhibitions And you can get there by subway even if its a bit of a walk around 1520 minutes from the nearest station I do think the exterior of the building could be so much more interesting; it just looks like a big shoebox And the galleries named for major donors are a bit offputting in terms of flattering their vanity But this museum is definitely worth a visit if you can get there Note its wheelchairaccessible once you get inside the museum but you have to climb a long incline to get up to the entrance In any case make sure to see the giant pagoda in the middle of the museum,"Written August 2, 2015"

1299,1299,JoannaK424,5.0,I was surprised to read that some felt that this was a boring trip with lots of historical artifacts and nothing else Its a museum Thats what a museum is all about   I took the English tour provided twice daily with a nice man who told us about the religious history emphasized the importance of the movable metal type that they have and showed us the gold crown and gave us a detailed history on it Along with his 1 12 hour tour I spent 4 hours there and it was well worth it Go only if you are expecting history you know because it is a museum ;  Oh And it is free for the general exhibit D,"Written May 17, 2012"
