2,Hwan Bae,1,"Seeing many people waiting for the  elevator  was   one i hate  and  without no seeing anything   from inside the elevator made me  unhappy and all the time that I being  forced to look up the celling creating various colorful lighting show that i didn't understand what they were meaning untill I was brought up on top of the building was another  irritating .Trying to find something that I didn't see anything and knowing that i couldn't  give them  wonderful, exciting and serious  impression throw the window  from the top have led to seeing me more of them  . cars , river ,roads were under my feet and they wanted to taller than me and this building.Why? .competing  with others to beat each other  is only the way of the world to live on  . My decision to go there  must not have been  considered very well on the plan i regret I should not have been there in a hurry  without thinking deeply  whether it would be better or not in  comparing  with previous tower called  Namsan tower had been visited in the morning and most of buildings found from it were connected with me when a child with mother ,  a schoolboy,an adolescence and a middle age. As soon as arriving there in the afternoon of the same day  I noticed that many people in line  in hot summer ,the elevator  with no greater than this  of other buildings but just packed with people swearing   have    made me sunk on every review of it.i should not have come here for i had visited  at  another tower  which still   reminded  me while   in the highest building and on the way home that Namsan tower has given me what I had been looking for were i a bird to fly sky on seoul  such as many houses and buildings reminded me of my past time and among them the house colored blue  where former presidents had lived before by  the  new president   has been moved away in other  location,YongSan .My time to have been this place is distractedly ruined by  staffs who didn't   endeavor to make it  perfect to be  remembered   forever and i  must feel that  i have been deceived by seeing nothing and paying too much money to a zero which means there are  not as  much more valuable things  to be empathize and enjoyed  with people when they are met together in one place as memorable  NamSan tower .I would have been no more duped had i considered very well  before entering whatever they are which are known as famous  spots  attracting  people nationwide   but  the elevator  and the skyrounge what  many people praise them everyday  as awesome   you must be disappointed with when arriving there.",4 hours ago

596,Benjamin Sung,1,"It was our fault that we visited on a school holiday, ""World School Festival"" or something like that. The entire park was overrun by middle and high school students, all still in their school uniforms, when we arrived after lunch. The lines for every attraction were hours long; the combined noise from the parade on the main level and the crowds was deafening; and the whole faculty was simply not navigable. On top of that, the magic pass we paid for with our tickets had some kind of glitch that caused it to fail on our phone, so we never even got into a line. After fiddling with the phone for half an hour while trying to avoid being stampeded by hormone driven high schoolers, we gave up and went to see if we could get a refund on our tickets. The ""information desk"" was a kiosk with a couple of tablets, with no staff person in sight. We fought our way through the crowd along the full length of the main floor twice looking for someone, anyone to help us; finally found a guy who showed us to a door hidden behind one of the walls of the park. By this time our 9-year- old was quietly sobbing into my arms, and I think that persuaded the clerk to grant us the refund, which he said was not normal policy. Even then, to get the refund, we had to make our way back through the crowd out to the ticket counter at the front gates, where they redirected us to the turnstiles, where they redirected us back to the ticket counter. Where they finally gave us the refund after figuring out that our magic pass had malfunctioned. But for me, even without the absurd crowd, not worth the money or time - there's so many better things to do in Seoul, and better amusement parks elsewhere if that's your thing.",2 months ago

845,Se Kweon Roh,5,"(Translated by Google) 'Unlike the neat exterior, the closer you look, the more overwhelming the skyscraper with the missing lines'  It is said that the shape of the building is shaped like a 'brush', and the façade of the building is said to have been inspired by 'Koryo celadon'.  It is said to have 'implemented the curve that encompasses the flexible shape and simple beauty common to Korean traditional objects', and presents the beauty of the Korean curve as a characteristic form.  The total number of floors is 6 stories below the ground and 123 above the ground, with a height of 555 m, making it the first skyscraper in Korea to exceed 100 floors and the 5th tallest building in the world (as of 2022).  Because of the high number of floors, the safety issue would be the most important aspect. He found hard rock and dug up to 38m underground, and from there, he overcame the risk of collapse by fixing 108 30m-long iron columns (1m in diameter) to the bedrock. .  (Original) '가까이서 볼수록 단정한 외관과는 달리 크기만으로도 압도되는 선이 잘 빠진 마천루'  건물 모양은 '붓'을 형상화하였다고하고, 건물 입면은 '고려청자'에서 모티브를 얻었다고 합니다.  '한국의 전통 오브제가 공통적으로 가지고 있는 유연한 형태와 단순미를 아우르는 곡선을 구현'하였다고 하며 한국적 곡선의 미를 특징적 형태로 내세우고 있는데, 유려하면서도 단아한 외관에서 이같은 특징이 잘 나타납니다.  전체층수는 지하6층, 지상 123층이고 높이는 555m로, 한국 최초의 100층을 넘은 마천루이며, 세계에서 5번째로 높은 건물입니다(2022년 기준).  높은 층수로 인해 무엇보다 가장 관심있을 부분은 안전문제일텐데, 단단한 암반을 찾아 지하 38m까지 파내 기초공사를 하였고, 그로부터 30m의 쇠기둥(지름1m)을 108개를 암반에 고정하여 붕괴위험을 극복하였다고 합니다.",2 months ago

851,Kiwoong Park,5,"(Translated by Google) It was the second high-rise tower I visited after the CN Tower in Canada. I went with my parents in the countryside on Mother's Day, and it was better than I thought. I think it was better because there is less fine dust from China these days, so the view is open. I was amazed at the structure of the building that was very similar to the CN Tower, as if it was almost taken out, and even the tourist products are the same. However, in terms of location, Jamsil Tower had a better view. Bukhansan Mountain and Namhansan Mountain, etc., the Lotte World seen below, and the regularly spaced apartment forests, there was more to see than I thought. The price is not even 20,000 won per person for 4 people, so I recommend you to go at least once.  (Original) 캐나다 CN 타워 이후로 두번째로 들른 고층타워였네요. 어버이날 지방에 계신 부모님 모시고 갔다왔는데 생각보다 괜찮았습니다. 물논 중국발 미세먼지가 요즘 적어서 시야가 탁 트여서 더 좋았던 것 같네요. CN 타워와 굉장히 비슷한, 사실 거의 빼다 받은 듯한 건물 구조에 신기했고 심지어 관광 상품도 똑같아요. 하지만 잠실이라는 위치상 오히려 잠실타워가 경관이 더 좋았습니다. 북한산, 남한산 등등 자연 경관과 아래로 보이는 롯데월드, 규칙적으로 간격이 딱딱 정해져 있는 아파트숲들이 생각보다 볼게 많았네요. 가격도 4인기준 인당 2만원도 안드니 한번쯤 가보심을 추천드립니다.",2 months ago
