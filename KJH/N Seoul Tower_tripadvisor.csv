Worth noting we were offered 25% off if we paid by cash instead of card. Bus went part way up the hill, then there was a short walk. Caught the cable car back down. You have to pay extra for this.","Written July 15, 2022"
1,SherbetMelbourne,4.0,We took a train and then a bus to get here. Once you hop off the bus there is still a failry decent uphill walk involved. Lots of greenery and the view was worth it.

They were also filming some kind of a K-drama at the top so we had to be quiet. Also, we used an app called Dealightme to get a discount for the tower entrance fee. I‚Äôm sure it would be a great experience where you can see beautiful sights of the whole city.

6,Traveller of the world,5.0,"With these view things, they are always hit and miss.  This was a hit and I would highly recommend coming!  Use the Cable Car to come.  We arrived just before sunset, the day views were nice but slightly cloudy.  As day turned into night, the views were spectacular.  Before getting your ticket and going to the top of the tower (or after), get a drink or bite to eat or browse the shops and soak up the atmosphere on the lower ground section.  Lovely with the lights.  Such a great vibe.  Can get chilly so take a light throw.  Purchase a ticket and then head up.  Pretty quick.  When you get to the top, it is all enclosed but the night views were stunning.  There are seats if your lucky enough to get one plus a place where you can purchase drinks, sweets, souvenirs and other things.  Very busy.  Strangely there were a lot of children!  Clean.  There are toilets as well. Waiting for the lift to go back down took a bit longer but was still quick.  Nice.  I would have liked it to be less busier so you could really soak it up and enjoy the views but it was a weekend and I still enjoyed it.  Would recommend for sure.  Staff are not the friendliest!  For those scared of heights, this was not that bad at all.","Written June 1, 2022"

12,Mel G,4.0,"We visited Seoul Tower during the summer of 2020. It was pleasantly even more enjoyable than I thought it would be. Be sure to wear walking comfortable shoes. The trolley up gives a lovely night time view. There's a love locket bridge. You and your special one can either bring a lock or purchase a lock at a little store and attache to a bridge or any of the rails in a certain area, you can also sign the benches and novelty items there. You'll know the spot when you see it. The elevator up the tower is super fast and all the little rooms you go through to get to the viewing spot at the top of the tower are delightful and offer opportunities for selfies, and pics. We enjoyed the great view of Seoul from the observation tower and the portions of the glass floor. Actually found some really great gifts to bring home to the kids who didn't travel with us. Overall, an enjoyable experience. Plenty of taxis outside, but beware they don't want to travel too far out of their radius so you might have to check with a few before finding one to get you back to your hotel, depending on where you are staying. Also know in general traffic in Seoul is horrible. It can take way too long to get from one spot to another. Plan for that as you make your plans.","Written May 8, 2021"
13,ChongWang,5.0,"Namsan Tower is a Korean landmark, and it is one of the tallest towers in Asia. It offers not only a view of all of Seoul, but also a chance to enjoy a meal inside the tower. At first, Namsan Tower was used for broadcasting, and then fully open to the public, it is worth watching the Namsan Tower lock wall, slowly a wall of locks, and the lock hanging on it must be a couple together. Now, the Nanshan Tower locked wall is a very popular tourist attraction. At Nanshan Tower, the highlight is that there are interpreters for multiple languages so that you do not have to worry about language barriers. Secondly, the entertainment near the tower is also very much available, which can satisfy no longer a single view of a tourist destination but can enjoy food and shopping at the same time as viewing the landscape.","Written April 13, 2021"

17,Augustine J,5.0,"Namsan Seoul tower or Seoul tower or the radio tower is a popular tourist spot in the heart of Seoul, close to Myeongdong. It is located on top of a mountain and is accessible by road/cable car/a hike. Prefer going in the evening to catch a glimpse of sunset & night time of Seoul. However, it gets crowded & boarding a cable car would be a long wait. A whole lot of love padlocks are put up in the rails & it was mind blowing to see them locked for years together. You can see a lot of people struggling to pose and snap the whole tower in the picture. This was fun to watch.

Remember the scene when Sim Cheong told Heo Joon Jae to meet at Namsam Tower on the next first snow? She walked up the hill and he drove up but she got into an accident and didn't make it to the top. You definitely don't want to miss Heo Joon Jae. So let me share with you a tip: How to get to N Seoul Tower!  Search on Kakao Map/Google Map: Namsan Ormi Elevator (Bottom Entrance) in my opinion this is the easiest way to get up! The Elevator is like a tram train, you'll be able to enjoy the surrounding view on your way up. Then follow the crowd and you'll get to N Seoul Tower!  When leaving N Seoul Tower back to the city, i recommend to catch a bus to the nearest station depending on your next destination.

I took the Hop On Hop Off Bus - Palace Route to get to the tower. It's still quite a hike up the hill, but the sun was out and the views of Seoul were really incredible. I feel very lucky that the weather cooperated and while there was some glare through the windows and a bit of haze, I think my photos came out okay and I had a good time just walking around the floor, looking at different points around the city. There is helpful signage with the distance of different cities from Seoul. There is a small gift shop where you can buy postcards and even mail them. There is a sit down restaurant, but I believe you need to have reservations. Once you get out of the tower, there are other restaurants and souvenir shops.

38,Tee L,5.0,My family and I vacationed in Seoul for New year's Eve. We stayed at the millenium Hilton in front of Seoul station. we didn't know what to do for New year's Eve countdown. So we decided to climb the mountain directly in front of the millenium Hilton. At The summit is Seoul tower. From which you can see the New year's Eve fireworks from down below. The temperature was about minus 8 degrees Celsius. We bundled up around 11 p.m. and started up. The hike was very lovely. As you hike up you can see a beautiful a 360 view of the city of Seoul at night. It's not a hard hike. And there are art installations along the way. Including a strange love heart lock it installation. Apparently you can buy love heart lockets and write a message and lock it around these fences and other art installations along the mountain. At the top of the mountain there are cafes and gift shops. You can purchase tickets to go in to Seoul tower. We did not do that. Instead We got some hot chocolate and coffees and celebrated 2020 watching the fireworks from down below. The fireworks were very small from our vantage point and not that impressive. but overall it was a beautiful hike and an absolutely fantastic way to ring in the New year. It started to snow along the way as well but that made it all the more romantic and special. My teenage daughter took many pictures. We walked around with our hot drinks looked around the gift shops and then made our way back down as we started to feel the chill. I highly recommend this hike.

75,Krubee,5.0,"Wonderful, Romantic and Memorable that's what we've experience visiting N Seoul Tower or Namsan Seoul Tower. In the chilly dusk of November in Seoul, we went here via Bus #3 in Chungmuro station exit 4. The ride took about 30 mins because it's the rush hour and many stops so if you would like a faster way to get here can take the Namsan Cable car or taxi or you could hike to the tower itself. Takes around 1,100 won one way and it is the last stop in its route. There are many tourists in the entrance and buses both public and tour buses and parked there so it tends to get busy. Indeed, it is one of the most visited attractions in Seoul. Standing high at 774 ft it is an observation and communications tower and the second highest in Seoul. It is my second time to visit this place but this time during the day. My first time in 2016 it was at night and we went on top of the observation deck inside the tower overlooking Seoul from Namsan Mountain where its located right at the heart of Seoul. The ticket costs around 11,000 KRW. This time around 2019 we didn't go inside but we visited the base of the tower which surrounded by the beautiful Namsan park and its wide array of trees that include Maple, Pine, Ginko, Cherry blossoms and many more. Since its fall the colors are full of Red, Yellow, Orange, White and Brown truly mesmerizing, eye catching, romantic and beautiful. We took a lot fo beautiful photos and videos before these blooming trees in the colours of Autumn. Up here you will have a panoramic view of Seoul - its skyscrapers, buildings, castles, villages and rivers. It is indeed a magical view for us. You don't even need to go up the observation deck. Another great feature we did is the Lock Padlocks where tourists and local couples put their padlocks as a key of their endearing love for each other. You could write your names and buy the key/padlock from the minimart inside N Seoul Tower. We indeed put our padlock in the midst of thousands of locks placed in this mountain. The Lock Padlocks also offer a great panoramic view of Seoul, the Tower and Namsan Park. We left just before night falls via bus and it was a short yet memorable visit for us. It is indeed of the best and beautiful destinations in Seoul so please do come visit when you arrive here in Seoul, Korea.","Written December 16, 2019"
76,Winston Chuah,4.0,"Like any tower in the world, N Seoul Tower has its own unique attractions. Located on the top of Namsan mountain, it offers breathtaking 360-degree views of Seoul city. There are 2 public transportation options to get there via cable car or bus. Via the cable car, there is no immediate subway access and you'll need to walk up the hill from Myeongdong subway station. Mind you, if you're traveling with young children or elderly, this can pose a challenge. Or you can take bus No. 02, No. 03 and No. 05.  Once at the base of the tower, the area is clean and pleasant to visit. Don't miss out on the love padlocks near the tower base for nice photo-taking opportunities.

The staff directing us toward the elevator and the one who went with us inside was really cheerful and attentive. The 3 stars is because when we went there in the evening, there were only a few staff that we could see, most of the time we didn't see any. The ones at the information were not too helpful as well. I was asking for help with the machine to scan the QR codes. I had 5 e-tickets and was asked to input the numbers instead one by one , took me quite a while to finish and when I could not read the last one since it had very small prints, the guard took the paper from me and scanned the QR code in just a few minutes (if only they told me that was the easier way then I wouldn't have wasted my time inputting the numbers manually).

But it was quiet on our visit and hence no line up and no one was in the room... we were free to act stupid and take videos of silliness before heading up. Once at the top, its a short 360 degree walk around with window panes distances to world cities imprinted on them, tourist trinkets and snacks for sale and a restaurant one floor down. Then it's another ride in the elevator back down. Speaking of elevator, even though the ride is 20 seconds at most they get you to look at a screen in the ceiling which plays a short video... I guess to stifle the boredom in the vertical box... all 20 seconds of it.  Oh, and the view. All depends on visibility.

Once you are up at the tower, there are numerous food options and I highly recommend the Korean udon restaurant which offers great views too. Other choices include a burger joint, Italian food and a grill on the highest floor of the Seoul Tower. There are usually cultural performances which features drumming and some martial arts by the open space near the ticket booth. The observatory is quite good but it was a hazy day when I visited with my family so don't expect to take nice shots from up there.

The ride was smooth, but the view from the car and from the tower is nothing special.

125,PracticalVacationer,5.0,"Background: get all your information from the N Seoul Tower website. Gettting there: most convenient is to catch the shuttle buses described in the website. They drive a circular route, so if you catch it at the beginning of the circle just after it has descended from Namsan Hill, it will be quite a lengthy ride of over half an hour before you get to the top of the hill. The best part is that it terminates at the base of the Tower. All other public transportation terminates at the base of the hill. Cable car: most directions will lead you to the north base of hill where the cable car is located. It will transport you up the hill to the base of the tower. It is a pleasant ride but reputedly has long lines. If you are staying in Namdaemun or Myeongdong, it is an easy 20 or 15 minute walk respectively to here. For the mountain climbers: 1. walk up the stairs adjacent to the cable car. 2. walk up the LONG road that the shuttle buses drive up. 3. search for typically unmarked nature trails that will take you up the hill At the base of tower: splurge and get in the VIP line by having lunch at N Grill. Best time to go: avoid the teeming masses by going at midday on a weekday. So we caught a shuttle bus on a Friday, zipped up to N Grill for lunch. Enjoyed a serene and delightful lunch with a view, then took the elevator down to the observatory for the touristy stuff. A wonderful 2 to 3 hours.

After the 40min wait you take the elevator up to a room with 360 projectors showing random animated movies on the walls, to distract you from the 30min addition waiting time here. When you finally reach the observation deck, you can barely see out the windows as the lights from all the souvenir shops there are reflecting in the glass.

160,Dawn S,4.0,"Lots of development around the tower over the past several years. My favorite way to get there is walking one of the many paths through the woods. I get lost every time I go so I will not try to give directions. Other options to the tower are cable car and bus. There is are shuttle buses that regularly circle loops between popular tourist destinations - this is easy and convenient. The tower now has many little shops, restaurants, coffee shops... plenty of snacks and trinkets to buy even without buying a ticket to go up the tower. This is nice in case you are there on a cloudy day when it‚Äôs not worth the $$ to go up the tower. Also plenty of photo ops and opportunity to get a love lock or leave your cell phone cover on the fences (not sure what this is all about)... visit the hello kitty island, etc. a trip up the old radio tower is quite spectacular - they have a neat light display before the fast elevator ride to the viewing floor. On the observation floor there are signs to let you know what you are seeing, pretty amazing views on a clear day, and (of course) shops to buy snacks and souvenirs. It‚Äôs been ages since we visited the restaurants up in the tower. It was a nice experience however, limited vegetarian options and not really great for little children. Overall a good place to visit, better on a clear day, wonderful to get a little exercise if you have the time and ability.

One thing to keep in mind is if you go on a Saturday night and do not make a reservation at their top tier, expensive restaurant you will wait a while to go to the top. When we bought our tickets it was going to be a 50 minute wait until they called our ""boarding number"" after the 50 minutes our boarding number was called and we were escorted into a light show room to get in another line and wait. Once we got to the end of that line you're escorted into another room to wait in another line. I thought we were being punked. Then we finally got to the elevator to go to the top.  We did eat at the lower level restaurant which was great! You order a meat and there is a buffet style of sides and other meats cooked to Korean style perfection! If you make a reservation for the expensive restaurant you don't have to pay the fee to go up, as it is included in your meal price and you are fast passed through to the elevator.

From the cable car station one could continue hiking up the steep hill or take the cable car and breathe in the breathtaking view of the city. Best time to visit, is late evening, so that one could capture the twinkling lights of the city below. After demounting the car, there is a walk up a few stairs to a landing with ice cream shops. The landing is indeed pretty, with cartoon characters constructed around benches and love birds locking the locks around the railing as a tribute or a promise to each other.

183,charlayyx,1.0,We planned an afternoon visit. If you are hard of walking like my partner or pregnant like myself this is not recommended. The queue to get tickets for the cable car is extremely long and in this Seoul late summer heat is was unbearable. The queue moves quickly however there is no coordination and it seems people just stand everywhere. Once tickets are bought you queue to get up to the cable car. As My boyfriend has a walking issue and I am pregnant we got the lift up however if this wasn‚Äôt the case you had to queue round the stairs of the building standing whilst waiting. The cable car itself is a nice experience if you enjoy heights and it has a nice view. Once you‚Äôre at the bottom of the tower it is equally as busy. We bought tickets to go up the tower at 6.40pm. We did not make it to the observation deck until 8.30pm. The boarding system is amongst all of the shops and cafes and it is a SHAMBLES. It‚Äôs very very very busy with very limited seating and as I say in this heat it is not enjoyable. You then queue to get to the observation deck once you have boarded and this again takes forever.

190,mimi,4.0,"So we recently visited the tower and I thought I might write down how we went about it and some suggestions. --------------------------------- When to go:  So we visited in early August and found that the best time to to go was the evening (of course this will depend on weather and month etc) . I would suggest you arrive at the tower by 7.00pm and be on the viewing platform by 7.30pm, as by 8.00pm it will be dark. This will allow you to view Seoul during the golden hour, sunset and night (when the whole city lights up). This will probably be one of the more busier times though, so beware. If you want a less busy experience maybe go early morning or around lunch and be don't visit on a weekend but a weekday. ---------------------------- How to get there:  We were staying in myengdong area which conveniently had a bus that takes about 15 mins to go directly to the entrance of Seoul tower. It comes every 15 mins and costs around 1,200 won without a tcard and 1,100 with. For those staying in myengdong the bus stop is to the right of myengdong Station entrance 2. The bus you will need to catch is the no. 5. Those staying in chongmyeong can catch either the no. 2 or 5. There are other methods of getting there. You could taxi or get the train to the bottom of the park and get the cable car up.  I would suggest that if you want to walk the hill/ Park area to get to the tower, that you should walk down instead of up. It is a step climb up, with quite alot of stairs and steep slopes. It would take you a good 30 mins plus to get to the top and you will be tired. ----------------------- Seoul tower Park:  So beneath Seoul tower is a sort of park area with a few viewing platforms, one of which is covered in love locks. I would recommend getting some of your photos group photos here. Its a little less busy and the view is almost as good. Beneath the tower there are many places to eat and shops. --------------------------- Seoul tower  The tickets can be bought online and at the tower. We bought at the tower and don't encounyer much of a queue. Tickets cost 10,000 won per adult and 8000 won for children and seniors. They are open tickets which mean there are no time slots allocated. You can enter the tower when you please and stay as long as you like.  There is one main viewing platform and it will be busy but the views are stunning. If you find yourself needing to get away from the hubub I would suggest you go down to the next level (sub viewing platform) and go to the toilet. Each has its own private view and the facilities are very nice.  I saw quite places to eat on each level with lots of different choices e.g Italian, Korean,  Chinese etc. I don't, however, know how much it costs. ------------------- Getting down:  When finished there are multiple ways to get down. The bus which you took to go up, the cable car and the walk. The cable car costs 7000 per adult and takes about 10-15 mins to get down to the bottom where it will drop you off near myengodon, where you can get to myengdong Station or just walk home.  However, if you are feeling up to it I would suggest walking down.  The path is well light, nicely paved with great views all the way down. It has a great view of the tower and its a nice stroll through the park area. The path is just left of the cable car when facing down the hill. I think it took us about 20 mins to get down. You will just about the reach the same area that the cable car will drop you off at. From there its a 10-15 min walk back to myengdong main street. --------------------- Worth it?  I believe so but I am a sucker for a good view and a relative payed for most of the trip. I can see how it may fall flat for many as it is very busy tourist hot spot which is arguably overpriced. I believe families should see this is as one of their big nights out. I still think those on a budget should go but maybe limit there spending by walking and taking snacks up with them to eat in the park. While Seoul tower is arguably the most iconic, there are still other platforms you can choose from. Also, if you were just viewing during the day and wanted a challenge then instead of observation decks go to some of the mountains that surround the city. We went to bukhansan (1/2 day quite hard hiking) which has amazing views.  Hope this helps people out. Sorry its so long, thought the detail would be good. --------- Protip: For those who do go in the evening (who are treating this like one of their big nights out) and finish the tower looking for dinner I would suggest going to woori Garden korean bbq in myengdong. Amazing stuff.","Written September 11, 2019"

193,Chellet C,5.0,"Not to be missed for korean drama enthusiasts! This famous landmark is seen in a lot of kdramas. It is great for a lovely stroll, date night, and sightseeing. Best to go just before sunset during the summer season to avoid the heat and to have a great sunset view. If using the cable car to get to the namsan tower grounds, get a roundtrip ticket as this will be cheaper rather than getting a one way ticket going up and then deciding to get another one way ticket on the way down. You could, if you‚Äôre trying to save money. But you would probably be too tired to hike down that you‚Äôre most likely going to end up taking the cable car on your way down again anyway. There is a separate ticket to get in to the namsan tower itself. It is not expensive so we did it. I was glad we did, as it gave us a 360 degree view of the city. It was really nice, as everything is lit up at night and you could see the view in a very colorful setting.","Written September 8, 2019"

The glass floor will give you a fright and if you are brave enough you can walk out onto the floor and have your picture taken. Looking straight down through the glass is amazing. On the floors at the base of the tower you will find restaurants. I thoroughly enjoyed this sightseeing excursion and did it at the beginning of my trip. From the observation floor you will get a 360 degree view of Seoul.,"Written September 7, 2019"

209,Troy C,4.0,"We were staying just a short walk from the tower cable car, so we thought we'd go one afternoon.  We got there around 16:30 and I was glad we did.  The ride in the cable car is reasonably priced, around $10:00 AUD, for a return trip.  The longest part of the journey was the 3 flights of snaking passenger line that we waited in.  The cable car offers a pretty good view, the car gets loaded to maximum capacity so try and get in first for a good window position.  Once up on the tower area, the views of Seoul just keep going.  It's very popular with locals, and we saw plenty of local sports teams during the night.  Plenty of places to eat, ranging from street cart style, food court to restaurants.  There is a padlock area that was supposed to be removed some months ago, but I think there may have been a lot of resistance to that move. You can still buy padlocks of various prices and write your message of love.  It was really nice watching the views change, this time of the year it didn't get dark until after 20:00 hrs.

228,Nathan Smith Jr,5.0,"This is one of the top rated things to do in Seoul and for good reason. The views from the top are absolutely unreal. That said, there is quite a hike from the bottom to the top of the tower. No cars are allowed in the area, so you take a shuttle bus costing about 1200 won per person from Myendong Bus stop 3, and a few other locations. It takes about 30 minutes to get there. From the drop off point, you have to walk up a steep hill for about 5 minutes to get to the lift to get to the top. Once there, you buy your tickets. They offer a student discount and also a senior discount for people over 65 and also a handicapped rate. Make sure you have some documentation of the disability as Japan and Korea are really tight about this and will not take your word, which is really stupid. Last week, we had to wait about 40 minutes because of the amount of people there, so we spent some time in the gift shop, capitalism amirite.

When the bus reached the parking lot, you still have to walk about 10 minutes in a steep slope to climb to the tower itself..  The place was full of people and stuffs being sold.. We were told it was nice to go up the tower in their observatory but we didn't.. There are toooo many people and very loooong lines.. If you want to go up you need to be early or stay longer.  The old ""shed"" in the area has a sad story behind it, ask your tour guide (if you have one) because im not spoiling..  There is an outside observatory deck which they call the love locks deck with scopes that will aid you to view the entire Seoul Landscape..  And speaking of love locks, they are literally everywhere.. In the park, near the tower, on the observatory, and you can find love lock trees.. You can buy one if you want to leave locks there.

There is a wait if you want to take the Omni elevator to the cable car station (or you can choose to walk up the stairs like we did), there is a wait to buy your ticket for the cable car, there was a 40 minute wait after that to get on the cable car, and then you have to walk up more stairs and buy your ticket for the tower and wait for 30 minutes until it is your turn to get in line and wait to go up in the elevator. The view from the top was beautiful. We had hoped to go up while it was still light and watch the sunset, but it was dark by the time we made it to the top. The only downside of this is that the lights inside the tower reflect on the glass so you can't take pictures of yourself and see the city very well. There is also a 30 minute wait to go back down the elevator. We did enjoy the view from the deck at the base of the tower and got some good sunset pictures.","Written June 22, 2019"

There are several restaurants should you feel hungry and want to eat. There is a convenience store for your basic needs. If you are travelling with very small children and elderly, it may be a challenge walking up the steep hill leading to the tower. There is a portion there where there are trees where you can attach your lock as a remembrance until the next time you visit the tower. The best way to reach the top is by car, if not, bus.

First of all, you can't get up to the tower area itself without walking up or taking a city bus or being part of a tour. No cars are allowed. That part was okay as we did go up by bus. What was disappointing was that it seemed very commercialized. There was a fee to go to the top of the tower.

We're reached the tower towards sunset to see the sun goes down on the city, but as the visibility was very poor due to the temperature and the atmosphere, we decided to check the tower itself. There is a deal for two at 22K W for two tickets + 2 drinks and 2 popcorn's (heavily stuffed with butter), and upon entering it looked very strange to the team there that we (as two tourists) didn't want to get ourselves pictured for an overpriced photo set (1 for 15K W and it goes on...)  Once we reached up we discovered that it is almost impossible to get a clear sight in the night because of the merchandise and internal lights that these boots are reflecting. All the surrounding windows had reflection of everything you see inside (people shopping, lights of candy stores etc.) and you could not take a decent photo with those reflections. I guess during the day it is much better, but trying to compare the pictures shown by the staff of Seoul at night makes you wonder where was it taken (on the roof top of from a different building :))....","Written May 12, 2019"

I didn‚Äôt have to wait long for my turn on the cable car, only about five minutes (around 10:45am on a Saturday). The trip up is about two minutes in the cable car, but they reallllly cram people in that thing. The views from the main platforms of the tower were excellent and it was nice to see the love locks as well. They have lots of food options there as well. I did not pay to go up to the observation deck, since I thought it was overpriced, especially when you get such good views from the free platforms. Please note, this is a super crowded attraction, so prepare yourself for that. I then walked back down, since it is much easier going down stairs for me - walk back down took about 10-15 mins for me, going slow.

Interesting fact - the tower itself uses lights to indicate whether the visibility is clear or not, so its a good practice to watch for the lights and then make your way there. You can get to the base of the tower for free, which itself is good enough to get a splendid view. But if you want to spend money, you can pay more and make your way up the tower which as a restaurant with a better 360 view.

387,Mark G,3.0,"Well, what to say really? Yes, it's obvious what the place is, it's a VERY popular tower on top of a mountain with viewing platform and restraunts up there. An yes, Korean restraunt up there was really nice and I'll review that separately. But as for the tower, the queue for the cable car up was easily 30 minutes, problems more like 40 plus, and this was a Sunday night. Don't be fooled by the queue for the tickets on ground level, that's just the start of your long, long quest to the top of the building, to get the cable car to the top of the mountain. I call it a quest, as it's almost something worthy of two small hobbits. I had read reviews that mentioned the queues, however I didn't quite read in enough detail to prepare for the queues that lay ahead, and I'm British, we're known for queueing, but I now think we should be handing that title for the Koreans. Then, once you finally get on the cable car and get to the top of the mountain, you can stop and have a look at the views from there, and then queue a further 40 minutes for the lifts up the tower proper. Now a good tip here, is to book a restaurant package to go up the tower, as this skips the lift queue up for you. View from the top is nice, but without the restaurant meal, it would have menat 80 minutes plus of queueing to get there. Then, to come down, repeat all the queuing again, so it was 40 miuntes to the bottom of the tower, which sadly the restaurant meal does not enable you to skip, and then another 40 minutes for the cable car. I know there's a bus to the top that misses the cable car, and we didn't try those so can't comment. If you're feeling adventurous, you can also climb the mountain on foot, althouh we thought that for an evening dinner out that might be a bit much.

The top of the tower itself was quite small, in terms of circumference. Only housing a candy store and a souvenir shop were located at the main viewing deck, with a non-advertised coffee shop at the lower floor which we would've gone to and stayed at if we had only known (they're the only accessible non-restaurant establishment with seats).

Seoul Tower. The price was prohibitive. However the booking agent for the tour told me that their bus would go to the base of the N. Seoul Tower. My friends who live here said that you have to walk up a long walk to get to the base of the tower.  So I hired a taxi and off we went on a dark, gray, overcast and snowy day to see the N. Seoul Tower. I expected the taxi would take me to the top, to the base of the tower. This was not the case at all. I saw the snow covered walk leading up a hill and had to decline a visit.  Disappointing? Yes indeed. But my timing was lousy and I had to be at the airport and won't have another chance to visit the N. Seoul Tower until who knows when.  What is the point of this review?

There is a long line for the cable car going up / down but it's well supervised and no pushing & shoving - everyone seemed rather civilised and it made the wait bearable. About a 15 minute wait in line either way. You get a good view of the city from the top of the mountain. We didn't go up the Tower (tickets were very pricey but I don't recall the exact price). The usual souvenir shop and some eateries at the top, go up if you enjoy the view. One can also opt to walk up / down and I would've considered the walk down if I had time to spare, it would have been pleasant in the cold. Word of warning though - heaps of taxis waiting at the foothill but do ask if they will use the meter - the first few we asked refused and quoted ridiculous fixed prices - we refused and on the 3rd attempt got one that was willing to go my metered prices. We went in a group of 12 and on average it took 3 tries to get taxis that were honest - so it's possible.","Written January 7, 2019"

The windows of the observation deck have names of other world cities and distances to them so you can have your photos taken by ‚Äòyour‚Äô home name. Even the toilet cubicles have a view! The restaurants at the observation deck are overpriced so just wait until you go out to the terrace where there are several coffee shops, ice creamery and a couple of average restaurants.

506,ozgwm2000,5.0,"This tower (also known as the Namsan Tower) is located on the second highest land point within the Greater Seoul area, located on the north side of the river. It was built in 1971, and is 236 metres high. It was built primarily as a communications tower, but with lookout facilites, restaurants, souvenir shops etc included within the design..  My partner and I just happened to be staying at a hotel that was within walking distance (10 minutes), which is how we made our way to it via Sogong-Ro road (on the north side), which then proceeds into a freeway tunnel into the hill beneath the tower and its surrounds. Just before the tunnel, and on the north-eastern side, we unexpectedly discovered that there is a cable-car that takes you from the aforementioned road level, up to the very large park that surrounds the actual tower itself. This saves you a somewhat steep walk up to the tower park... but if you're into exercise then by all means skip this free ride and walk up instead. It's quite steep.  There is also road access to the tower and surrounding park that comes in from the south, and I assume that you can get a cab up, and there are many coach day tours that can also get you to this park and the tower.  There is a LOT to see in the surrounding park, even before you decide to take the lift up the tower itself. The landscaped area surrounding the tower has many restaurants, fast food outlets, souvenir shops, and lookout platforms.The views even just from these large viewing platforms is very impressive, and you can spend an hour or more here, depending on whether there are special events, displays, and/or entertainment on the day of your visit, before you even consider taking the lift up to the top of the tower itself.  But the main purpose of your visit still must include a ride in the fast vertical lifts to the tower viewing platforms where you get a 360-degree view of Seoul. Quite spectacular. Again, shops and food outlets on this high viewing platform.  And... (I can only speak for the male visitors...) DO make a point of visiting the male toilets here! Men... you can stand at a narrow urinal against what is effectively a glass wall, and take in the stunning views of Seoul as you relax and relieve.... and... even taking photographs from the men's toilets are encouraged.

518,Mark G,3.0,"Well, what to say really? Yes, it's obvious what the place is, it's a VERY popular tower on top of a mountain with viewing platform and restraunts up there. An yes, Korean restraunt up there was really nice and I'll review that separately. But as for the tower, the queue for the cable car up was easily 30 minutes, problems more like 40 plus, and this was a Sunday night. Don't be fooled by the queue for the tickets on ground level, that's just the start of your long, long quest to the top of the building, to get the cable car to the top of the mountain. I call it a quest, as it's almost something worthy of two small hobbits. I had read reviews that mentioned the queues, however I didn't quite read in enough detail to prepare for the queues that lay ahead, and I'm British, we're known for queueing, but I now think we should be handing that title for the Koreans. Then, once you finally get on the cable car and get to the top of the mountain, you can stop and have a look at the views from there, and then queue a further 40 minutes for the lifts up the tower proper. Now a good tip here, is to book a restaurant package to go up the tower, as this skips the lift queue up for you. View from the top is nice, but without the restaurant meal, it would have menat 80 minutes plus of queueing to get there. Then, to come down, repeat all the queuing again, so it was 40 miuntes to the bottom of the tower, which sadly the restaurant meal does not enable you to skip, and then another 40 minutes for the cable car. I know there's a bus to the top that misses the cable car, and we didn't try those so can't comment. If you're feeling adventurous, you can also climb the mountain on foot, althouh we thought that for an evening dinner out that might be a bit much.

531,ohteoh,4.0,"We went at night on 2018 Boxing Day and it was freezing! There is a long line for the cable car going up / down but it's well supervised and no pushing & shoving - everyone seemed rather civilised and it made the wait bearable. About a 15 minute wait in line either way. You get a good view of the city from the top of the mountain. We didn't go up the Tower (tickets were very pricey but I don't recall the exact price). The usual souvenir shop and some eateries at the top, go up if you enjoy the view. One can also opt to walk up / down and I would've considered the walk down if I had time to spare, it would have been pleasant in the cold. Word of warning though - heaps of taxis waiting at the foothill but do ask if they will use the meter - the first few we asked refused and quoted ridiculous fixed prices - we refused and on the 3rd attempt got one that was willing to go my metered prices. We went in a group of 12 and on average it took 3 tries to get taxis that were honest - so it's possible.","Written January 7, 2019"

535,chephrenchua,3.0,"Our trip started when we walk from myeong dong to the 45 degrees ""train"" at foot of the hill, it's free but works like a lift, sometime it could get over crowded. Then reaching the top, we proceed to buy our ticket for the cable car tower, there was no queue when I was there, but I can imagine the freezing cold waiting in line to buy the ticket, better use klook app and get some discount or buy at the machine. Still we need to queue going up the stairs to the cable car (more like cable BUS) there are 2 BUS one goes up one comes down. They will crowd about 20 people or so into the STANDING only BUS. If you are unlucky enough, you get squeezed into the middle of the BUS and see nothing but other people's head. So I suggest that if you moved towards the door and the BUS is still not full, stand aside for other people to board, you rush in to the next ride for prime view. During cold season, when you reach the top, it is freezing windy, so be prepared for the open air walk. Bring your own lock if you do not want to buy the ""LOVE LOCK"" at the top of the hill. Put your lock and throw the key....into a box provided. (unlike the romantic movie where you throw it into the forest. The tower ticket is way too expensive and I think day time is better, because the night scene can hardly be seen with lots of souvenir store lights reflecting against the windows, so you have to press your head against the glass to really see night scene of seoul. I didn't get to try the food so no comment on that.

It's only 1200 for adults 350 for kids. Same thing when you are returning back. The cable car is 7000 one way for adults and connects from the base of the tower to a middle station. For us we have been in many before and it didn't justify the short ride. Spend some 1-1.5 hours at the base of the tower and take in the beautiful views of the city. The weather was great and we took lots of photos. And we didn't pay to go up the tower because every country has a talk tower and it's pretty much the same üòÄ,"Written November 26, 2018"
537,Northstar31200414085,5.0,"Another reviewer said ""...Yes, there is a cable car. But the hike is very easy - it's reasonably flat and you get pretty good views all the way up."" That is what it said in the book on Seoul that I bought in Honolulu before going to Seoul. My wife and I found the opposite to be true. I took as 3 hours to get from where out taxi dropped us off to the top. In retrospect there was a Bus stop sign at the bottom but no idea when it might come so we elected to walk. Three hours later (with seven yellow busses passing us going up during the time it took us to walk there) we arrived with my wife very sore legs and mad. ""Reasonably Flat""... I don't think so.. I would call it steep.  Once we finally arrived it was nice. We went to the upper level W 10,000 each, and got a framed souvenir photo W 25,000 which was nice... you can choose your background of views from the tower.  Unfortunately, it was very cloudy that day, and we couldn't see much of anything of the city from the tower, but they did warn us about that before charging us to go to the upper level, and after that hike we wanted to go up anyway. I think i would be spectacular when it is not cloudy... it was just our bad luck the weather was like that. I hope someday we can go there when the weather is good!  We enjoyed the fence where the lovers attach the padlocks with their names together and took some pictures there, and the Vanilla Shake at the Ice Cream concession was delicious.  We decided to take the cable car back down, which was scenic, but we found that once we arrived it was a long walk to MyongDong Subway Station, which the map implies was colocated with the Cable Car terminal... it is not. It is also a steep road from the Cable Car terminal down, so if you were going to walk up from the MyongDong Subway Station to the cable car terminal it would be quite a hike... although certainly less than the alternative hiking trail.  If we go there again I would either: 1. Wait for the Yellow Bus at the bottom of the Hiking Trail where the taxi dropped us off ... I think he sign at the top said the Bus was only W 1,200 or something like that.  OR 2. Insist that the taxi take you all the way to the Cable Car terminal... and get the hotel or somebody to write that in Korean to show the driver since it appears none of the taxi driver's understand English.  The fare for the Cable Car is almost the same for round trip as one way, so IF you can be sure the taxi will take you all the way to the Cable Car terminal that is probably the best choice. Otherwise the Yellow Bus from the bottom of the hiking trail.  Aside from that I agree with all the other observations of the review by EmmaVestrheim.","Written November 23, 2018"

View is nice but the kids found it too boring so we were out in less than 15 mins. We didn't realise that taxis are not allowed into the area. The taxi driver took us to the cable car station instead. There are shuttle buses going in and out. Price is 1200 won per person regardless of child or adult. Prepare exact as there will be no change given.  The burger set meal was a bad experience. Burger was so so. The staff did not allow us to change drinks. Was told to clear the table after we are done with the meal - which we happily did but while throwing the stuffs away, we were given death stare by the staffs as we clearly did not know which rubbish should go into which bin. If you expect tourist to clear their own tables, please don't give us a bad attitude when we try to do it to our best understanding.

542,coellomilton,5.0,"This is one of the most iconic touristic places in Seoul city, not just because of the popularity among tourists but also the deeply ingrained historical meaning that this piece of architecture has for Seoul and their citizens.  If you have been in Seoul for at least a week or more and you still haven¬¥t visited the N Seoul Tower you might have noticed that you can see this touristic attraction from anywhere in Seoul. And since the tower is located on the top of the Namsam park and it glows in different colors at night, this makes tourists wonder about what's happening on the top of that mountain, so don¬¥t waste your time and go have some fun up there  Firstly, you can get up there on foot in 30 minutes or you can take a cable car and appreciate the landscape of Seoul city and the park as well. If you decide to take the cable car there is a return ticket and one-way ticket for both children and adults. I recommend you to consider the weather before choosing between getting up there on foot. If you do it by foot you can appreciate and surround yourself with the nature of the park but winter is so cold in Korea that temperatures can plunge to -20 degrees in late January and not everyone has experienced that temperatures in their countries. On the other hand, if you are visiting Seoul during the fall you'll have a great time watching the autumn foliage.  Secondly, once you are at the top of the Namsan park you'll see that there are many ways to have fun and have a quality time with friends and family. There are several foreign and Korean restaurants at affordable prices and many souvenirs shops too. And if you are lucky you will see a Korean royal guard ceremony or a Pansori presentation which is a Korean traditional folk dance. Outside and on the right side of the tower, there is a wooden deck where you can see the cityscape of Seoul.","Written November 11, 2018"

It is lovely to be able to see the whole city laid out before you and be able to distinguish its different areas. I am sure the night view is great as well, but I can definitely recommend a day trip.  I would suggest getting the cable car up and walking down, because although not steep it is a long, slow rise to get to the tower. If you're like us - enjoy walking but maybe not in the best shape! - then your legs are sure to be achy. And the cable car ride does offer a lovely view that's worth paying for. Inside the tower, you can pick up souvenirs (possibly slightly overpriced), eat at restaurants (quite dear), or perhaps enjoy a drink at the Twosome cafe. We had beer and cake there, and enjoyed the view for a surprisingly reasonable price.  One thing to look out for are performances at the bottom of the tower. There's quite a large square with viewpoints alongside it. When we arrived, some sword-fight demonstration was going on. Worth staying behind a few minutes for if it's happening.","Written May 28, 2018"

Then the view from the top is (at least at night) largely obscured by the bright lights of the gift shop displays which are DIRECTLY behind all the windows. So you're essentially seeing glare, not the beautiful city lights. Big tourist trap too - lots of kitschy souvenirs and overpriced food.

655,MariusVanc,5.0,"If you're in Seoul for more than a day, definitely consider visiting the tower. You can get there by subway (close enough) from the Myeongdong stops, and walk towards the mountain. Eventually you will see signs for the Namsan park and tower.  At the base is a gondola, but walking up the staired path is free, and takes about 20 mins at a leisurely pace. There are good views and photo spots along the way.  At the top there are some assorted restaurants and eateries, and the tower itself.  Also, at the plaza there is usually some kind of cultural-related event taking place, and there is the world famous ""love lock"" wall you've seen in many Korean dramas.  The walk down is rather steep, so be careful if it is wet.","Written October 24, 2017"

I read that in the afternoon the line can be quite long. Then once you get to the top there are alot of steps to get up to the tower. I opted to take the bus up instead. I didn't go up to the observation deck but you can get a decent view from below as well. LG has three OLED curved displays. One is a wave, the other is a tunnel and the third is a circle. There is also a 3D immersive video display as well which is kind of cool. I waited as long as I could but I had to leave at 6pm. Unfortunately the tower was not fully lit up yet.

We left our hotel about a mile from the tower at 2pm walking and returned at about 6pm. The time is spent waiting in lines to get up the cable car and the tower. About an hour wait for the cable car and 30 min for the tower. The observation Deck is worth the extra money. I really did not understand how big this city really is until I was on the observation Deck. As far as the eye can see in every direction, the city sprawls out over the landscape.

Once up there, we went to the place where there were the love locks. It was pretty cool. And makes for a nice photo stop. You can place a lock there as well, but you'll have to pay a fee to purchase a lock I think. We didn't do that. But lots of people were doing that.  We then continued to the tower. The top was really great, with cafes, restaurants and souvenir shops there. The highlight is the top of the tower where you could just stay and admire the city. Really beautiful, with all the city lights at night. You could even buy snacks and popcorn there.  On the way down, the cable car broke down! And everyone was queuing to get refunds. They staff were good and helped to move things along as quickly as possible and we got a refund for not just the trip down, but the whole return ticket price! So it wasn't too bad.

I didn't and still don't understand the option to buy a popcorn bucket and coke combo with your ticket. Que and get in the lift. They tell you to look at the ceiling of the lift and you watch a retro 30 second clip of going up the tower and exploding off into out of space and land somewhere. You step out the lift, around the corner and stand in another que for a photo in front of a green screen to which you stand in line again to see your photo with 4 different sceneries with or without the tower in it. You need to pay 12,000won for a photo or more for a framed photo or 2.  You can bypass it. Congratulations, your at the top of the tower. Multiple signs of No Photo's Allowed. You can sit on some steps/platforms they have. You can buy some expensive souvenirs and pay by weight a self fill bag of selected candies.

I really wanted to spend one day and go visit it so I waited for a Sunday evening thinking this would be a great opportunity and a quiet time. I asked my hotel could I go to the tower by taxi and they say yes it would cost about $30 US. I got into the taxi and pointed at the picture that I had on my cell phone of the North Seoul tower and he departed the hotel. I did not know taxis and Individuals are not allowed to enter and drop you off at the north Seoul tower so he dropped me off at the cable car lift. The line for people waiting was approximately one hour. When I got up to the top of the lift I entered and bought my ticket for the tower observation deck. There was a lot of people upstairs but it was a pretty foggy night so the view was not great. Trying to get back down again you had the lineup for approximately 35 to 45 minutes to get the elevator back down again. All in all it was a good experience but would've been a lot better if it wasn't so foggy. I headed back to the cable car as I had bought a round trip ticket at 10:45 pm because the cable car was closing at 11 PM. The line to get into the cable car was approximately three times longer than the first time I got in coming up. I knew I would be stuck in the line for at least two hours. I ended up walking down the mountain in about 14 minutes. I still recommend this experience but I suggest two things: number one: you go there and make sure it's not a foggy day and number two: don't use the cable car unless you don't mind waiting, just use one of the city buses that are available to go up the side of the mountain to drop you off and return you back down afterwards.","Written June 4, 2017"

From pavement level and only a few minutes walk from the main shopping area it is a few steps up to the lower funicular station. This is a free lift up to the lower cable car station. The funicular is a single car that shuttles about a dozen people up an incline, very smooth. Stage two is a cable car that shuttles about two dozen people up to the top of the mountain. There are two cars and there is a small charge and also very smooth. The actual tower is the third stage but you do not need to go if you do not wish.

Or, you can try taking the cable car for more romantic feeling.  Walking up the mountain by passing thru the park towards the tower can be a good exercise","Written May 4, 2017"

When it finally came to view, it doesn't compare to the other towers I've been to in the US. It's supposed to be built somewhat on the basis of the Seattle Needle. There is definitely no comparison. Smaller than we thought, and the way to get up the tower seems like a maze and the signs weren't all that clear. VERY small lookout tower. Good variety of eatery and shops.

It was very crowded this time round with long lines snaking up the stairs leading to the cable car boarding station. The boarding process could be done better and safer in my opinion like having a holding area with set number of people held in a room or something safer instead of having people stand in long lines along the Verona stairs which I consider as a potential safety hazard. Overall a memorable experience and brought back seeet memories when I was younger then üòÄ Would have given 5 stars if not for the excrutiatinf long wait times snaking up various stairways.

There are three options on how to reach the base of the tower: take the cable car, hike it up for free or take the bus. We chose the first option as it was the sure way we wouldn't miss the sunset from the observation deck. In order to get to the cable car, we took an inclined outdoor elevator from the entrance for free. It took less than 2 minutes to reach the cable car station and 8,500 Won was all for the round-trip ticket. It started to snow on our way up and it was a bumpy ride because of the strong wind but the view was too awesome to even care about it. ^^ We hopped off at the base of the tower and we were greeted by thousands of love padlocks which is frequented by the lovers for their ceremonial confession and proof of love. #SEOULromantic @@ MOVING ON üòÖ we finally entered the base of the tower and proceeded to N Photo Studio where a staff took us a picture and had it photoshopped with the tower in the background. You may or may not buy it but Rachelle ordered one for us. We then aimed for the elevator to take us to the observation deck. Waiting to get in was another trip in itself as they projected a video as if you're about to launch into space. Imagine what it was like when we stepped into the elevator! I've no words, literally. ^^ See it for yourself. Video to be uploaded. ^^ Reaching the observatory means taking in an excellent panoramic views of Seoul. The sky wasn't very clear but the sights were still awesome, at least for me! Hehe. I pictured Hyun Bin or Rain might be in one of those buildings. Or possibly Daniel Henney shooting his film.

Apparently it's on the other street from where we are. So from myeongdong station go to the road on the right of pacific hotel.. just go through that path ahead and when you see the CU store on your left, turn right to get to the other side where the elevator is ahead of you. Once you're on the cable car station.. buy your one-way or roundtrip ticket and the loading station is at the 3rd floor.  Ride is very quick so even if there's a queu, waiting time is not really long. Once you're up, you'd be greeted by a great view of the city.

If you're with a love one, it's good to put a lock on it too to signify your unending love :) they sell locks there for 5,000 won to 15,000 won (couple locks). You can also bring your own!!

Luckily I found a young couple later on and was told that I had to take a shuttle bus to go up the hill. After the trouble, it was an enjoyable experience.

So I just sat around waiting.  After given entry, had to wait and qued another 20 minutes to get into the lift.  Finally got to the top only to find the observation deck packed with people.  Its hard to take selfies due to the reflections from lights on the observation deck.  The whole mood was ruined. Me and my wife just wanted to leave after less than 5 minutes of reaching the deck.  Getting back down from the tower again was another nightmare. Queued for another 30minutes just to get on the elevator.  Any activities was stopped due to the packed crowd.  After which, queued another 30minutes just to get on the bus back to the city.  Despite all of that, I still saw droves of tour busses full of China tourists pouring in as we left. If u ever plan to visit South Korea, please make sure it does not coincide with a China holiday.

848,AnonyU,3.0,"You can go to the cable car place by car, cab, bus, or by foot. After you reach at the edge of the mountain, you get to take cable car or climb up the mountain.  Pros 1) You get to see Seoul in one site 2) though the cable car is expensive, you can climb up the mountain to reach there 3) have cool performance in the afternoon  Cons 1) Ticket for observation deck is not worth the price. If you wish to go, i recommend you to get combo stuffs. Pay some more and grab some snacks 2) When climbing from Myeongdong, the slope is too high. If your shoes are uncomfy, just take cab or bus up there  Tips If you wish to go for observation deck, i recommend you to look for tickets online. It's nice when you go there at night or during sunset I wouldn't really recommend you to go up to the observation deck as there is nothing much to do up there. There are weekly basis performances and benches just below the tower and it is good enough to have to sight when you are climbing up the mountain. If you're not a local, and love makeups, it would be good to visit Myeongdong when visiting Seoul Tower. Myeongdong is right below the mountain area, walkable distance.","Written August 31, 2016"

To add on, instead of going up the tower, we decided to hang around the observatory deck to wait for the lights at night to come alive. It was quite a pretty sight to take in.

We obtained 2 lift tickets that also included drinks and popcorn. From then on the experience was spoiled somewhat because it just seemed like a tacky cinema. You do get some amazing views from the base of the tower and from the tower itself, though the windows are filthy. At the top there is a massive sweet shop and a small coffee bar. There are few places to sit and it is crowded. The men's urinal is definitely worth a visit.

We enjoyed views of the old and new city, and we enjoyed spotting several locations we had visited. We also bought the crazy pose tourism photos as this was our first and probably only trip to Seoul. But outside on the hilltop we really enjoyed the glimpses of the ancient wall and the warning beacons (reminiscent of Lord of the Rings)! We also bought a set of ""love locks"" and wrote our message, latched them onto the wall, and threw the key over the side to the chuckles and shutter clicks of many Koreans who were amused by our participation in their tradition :-) We finished our time on the mountain with a decent lunch at N Burger.","Written August 1, 2016"

At the bottom of the tower itself has aa few cafes where you can sit and enjoy the view. They have this place where you can lock your locks something like the bridge in london if i'm nit wrong. Ypu can get up to the tower either by climbing the stairs though not recommended as the stars is steep and its tiring. You can also get to the tower via the cable car but it is always crowded sith people from CHINA. Alternatively you can get up by the bus. It will alight you a few metres from the tower itself where you can walk up a steep slope to the tower itself. Its recommended to go if you in Seoul.,"Written May 8, 2016"

It would have been a nice night view but I went in the afternoon and still get to see the city below. As I hop into the cable car, I can't help but think of Lee Min Ho and Goo Hye Sun in Boys Over Flowers when they were trapped there overnight. All the surrounding trees were rather bare and not much flowers in sight at this time, perhaps later after the rain. In the main square there is cultural performance at 3.00pm and I was lucky to catch it. Very enjoyable. There's a small souvenir shop, a couple of coffee outlets, a hamburger place and a few eateries (but they appear to be closed).

We were fortunate to have had clear weather, and the views were spectacular. That brings me to the food. It wasn't bad. In fact, it was very good. The menu is price fixe with several options. Our family all chose beef, which was good. The surprise of the meal was the parmesan soup - which did not sound appealing but was very good. For dessert, the cheese plate was standard fare.

There are many paid and unpaid photo opportunities. Before you go up the elevator, you are asked to take a picture in front of a green screen and when you get to the top, you can see the various backgrounds your picture could be on and available for purchase. There is a cafe and gift shop available and pay per use binoculars are also available.  The hike up to the tower is not too steep but the ascent could be tiring. There is a cable car available that takes you almost to the base of the tower but the cost is extra each way and the parking lot is in a different location.

975,Debapriya C,4.0,"We visited Seoul Tower on the day of ""chuseok"" (major harvest festival) 2015. We did not plan but the day was 27th September, the supermoon night. We reached there by bus from Chungmuro station in Seoul. The bus was over crowded. We could even spot foreigners like us and couples wearing traditional hanbok (Korean dress). We reached and saw a big crowd moving up towards the Seoul Tower. (It reminded me of Durga Puja crowd in my hometown Kolkata). I was a bit disappointed. Then we reached the tower by walking the steep slope. ( I always want to visit again by the cable car or by hiking through the gently rolling slopes or the steps up to the Namsan Tower). There was a long queue in front of the ticket counter. Anyway we took a ticket for the Alive Museum and the tower observatory. As soon as we entered the Alive museum our mood changed totally. The Alive museum might look childish to most of us in the beginning (I also had a preconceived thought). But I bet everyone will enjoy this museum. The beautiful and amazing 3D sculptures created by contemporary artists are a wonderful experience as a whole. We spent quite a good amount of time posing and photographing each other in front of the sculptures. After that we reached the observatory. It was almost the time of sunset. We could almost see the entire city. It looked amazing. We stayed there for about one and half hours and enjoyed the scenes outside. The city of Seoul at night with supermoon was a lifetime experience for us. The traffic on the both sides of Han river looks like glittering golden ribbon. It‚Äôs worth visiting Seoul tower at night. But I will try to visit Seoul Tower in a weekday when there will be a little less crowd.","Written November 2, 2015"

979,sborrink,5.0,"If you visit Seoul, one of the most iconic structures to see is the Seoul Tower, also known as Namsan Tower. You can get to the tower by taking a bus or cable car. To take a bus you simply take the subway line 3 to Dongguk University Station, Exit 6. Around the corner (do not cross at the light) there is a bus stop. You can take bus 2, 3 or 5, but bus 2 is the one that comes the most often. It is best for you to have a T-money card so that when you transfer from the subway to the bus, it will not cost you anything. The bus stops at the bottom of a very steep incline that you need to walk up to get to the tower. It is not advised to take this route if you have bad knees or other ailments. To get to the cable car take subway line 4 (light blue) to the Myeongdong station, then take exit 7 or 8. You can wait for the shuttle bus or you can walk to the elevator. Walk in the direction of traffic along the main road, towards Shinsegae department store and Hoehyeon station direction. You will come to a big junction at the end of the road, turn left and continue walking. You will see the elevator, but unlike normal elevators, this one is very different. It moves up at an angle rather than straight up and down. From there you will have to purchase a ticket for the cable car (8,000-10,000 won). You will get a scenic view of Seoul as the car, which is usually crowded, makes its way up to the station on the top of the mountain. From there you will have to climb some stairs to reach the tower. This way is not nearly as strenuous as the hike up the steep hill, however, it is not advised for people who are claustrophobic. Once you get to the tower you will find that there are several places to eat, sit , relax and enjoy the view. You can go up into the observation tower (10,000 won) and you will have a wonderful view of all of Seoul. There is a restaurant above the observation level and there are several little trinkets you can buy at the tower. It is a great place to spend an hour or so at.","Written October 15, 2015"

When we were here we had the luck to be part of a event where they dressed you in hanbok and together with local people you did a ritual to warn the people of hostile powers (?!) :) When we came up there we did the classic love lock :) Its really cute of all the people to make different love texts to the one they love - where we also made a promise to come back here again! :) After that we went up in the tower and was just staring at the incredible view. We ate an looked the great view, took millions of pictures and then went back down again by walking the beautiful path down!! It was one of the best to-do in Seoul and we highly recommend it!

Definitely, the N Tower is an excellent place to start -or end- your visit to South Korea. There are plenty of ways on how to get there. Taxi, Metro and Bus will do it but i think the cheapest is Metro and then changing to the bus. I do not have in mind the bus lines but you can look them up on the internet. I recommend you try to get up on both, day and night, since it is really beautifull and worth it. The tower is located in a park, so you might as well take a hike and enjoy the nature.

A mix of large buildings, bridges, the river, the mountains and the green parks will leave you speechless.  Getting to the top offers a few options. First you need to get to the base of the tower. You can walk, take a bus or take the Namsan Cable car. We chose the cable car. Just past the Myongdeong station exit, near Namsan tunnel, you will find a set of stairs or an elevator to the cable car station. It was 8,500 won per adult and 6,500 per child. We were there at opening (0930) and were first in line. The car was packed when we went up but the views were spectacular.  Once at the base, there are multiple places to relax, eat and sight see. Bring a lock and lock it to the fence, it's a tradition. To get the the observation deck, you must pay. There are multiple options. Some include food, drinks and other events. We chose the popcorn and drink specials. 20,000 won for 2 tickets, 1 popcorn and 2 drinks. The popcorn was huge!  The ride to the top was fast. Once off the elevator the views were amazing. The observation deck is enclosed, clean and spacious. There is souvenirs and a resteraunt.  Overall we spent about 90,000 won to get from the city to the top for 2 adults and 3 small children.

It's worth the visit - especially the view from the observation deck! - and there are often traditional performances on weekends during the summer.  LOCAL TIP: Don't take the green N Seoul Tower tourist busses as they're usually overcrowded and only run every 30 minutes. Take Bus #3 from the bus stop on the main road closest to exit 4 of Itaewon Station. It's a local neighbourhood bus, takes the same amount of time and costs the same as the tourist bus but offers more busses and is far less crowded. I also recommend taking the bus up (no taxis allowed) and the cable car (6,000 KRW) down, which will bring you out in Myeongdong.","Written September 6, 2015"

We went up to the viewing deck, but this was inside, with glass splattered with rain drops and light reflecting from the various tourist tat sellers - basically not really worth the money, the time as it didn't give a much better view than what we'd seen already and yielded poor quality photos.

We took the bus down the road from Exit 2, Chungmuro Station which took us up to foot of a hill. We had to hike up the steep hill to get to the base of the tower. It was very busy. The tower was full of the locks of love. It was quite an interesting sight. The ticket counter person wasn't very nice. Most people were standing around to check which was the best ticket to buy as they had couple combos etc.and she kept asking us to move ahead. We have no choice and had to choose something at the spur of the moment. She was rude. The journey up to the tower was speedy with a clip shown on the ceiling. Once up there, the view was incomparable - stunning. It didn't take long for our feet to start aching as there were so many people around and so few seats. When we were heading down, we had to wait in a long queue which made our feet ache even more. When we finally got down, we decided to take the cable car down as it is supposedly part of the tower experience. We had a very long wait as it was busy. Our aching feet didn't enjoy the wait either. There was nothing romantic about the cable car ride. We were jam packed in a cable car of at least 30 people. If i were to describe that experience, I'd say we felt like tunas/sardines in a can. I would tell future travelers to give it a miss and take the bus instead. It's cheaper and more convenient. Don't waste precious time waiting to be packed into a sardine can.

The night view was great but its very similar to all other big cities. With heaps of light and buildings. Shops there are overpriced. Not many seats for people to rest. And if you want to get up the ACTUAL TOWER you need to pay some extra money again which we did not bother. Lucky we went on a week night there wasn't too many people to line up for the tram.

Then going up the elevator to the top, views are of course stunning, but the shop is a bit uninspired and the post office at the top floor seemed to need quite some time to get our postcards bqck to Europe.

You can take a cable car up. When you get to Namsan Seoul Tower, you can hang out at the base of the tower, which is where you can sign a lock with a message, grab a bite to eat + sometimes catch an outdoor cultural performance. If you pay an extra 9000 won, you can take a 30 second elevator ride to the top of the tower, where you can get a good view of the city (depending on the weather), grab an expensive cup of coffee, and then come down.

Lights from buildings, street lamps, and traffic jams(!) are making beautiful scenery every nights.  - Entrance fee is reasonable(about 10USD) compared to another well known observatories.(Tokyo Skytree, Shanghai Oriental Pearl Tower, Seattle Space Needle...)  - Even in rainy/cloudy days, this tower shows you very unique view. But I don't recommend to visit here in bad weather days. However, if you already have been here many times, rainy+cloudy view from observatory will give you another nice experience.  - The 5th floor of observatory is revolving restaurant, which is reservation-required(generally, you need to make a reservation 3~4 days before for weekday) and very expensive.(most of dinners cost more than 100 USD).

We went and paid the KRW9000 to go up the observatory, but it was disappointingly small compared to those in Macau and Shanghai. It was an unnecessary expense.

Quite cold & breezy during the winter and chilling like any other place in Seoul.  The cable car comes quickly however it is not the usual small cable car with seats. It is of the larger ones where a lot people gets packed into it in a standing position.  There's food available around the tower and also the famous love-lock thingy.  The tower itself however, is quite small and the overall place will take less than an hour to be fully explored.  The walk from the nearest subway station to the cable car station is quite tedious, you'll have to do some 15-30 mins walk depending on your speed and climb some slope while doing it.

It was only after we alighted up there when we had the glimpse of N-Seoul Tower vividly so captivating with its colorful and dazzling lights.

On the way there, you will come across a platform full of locks that presumably couples attach to profess their love for each other.

Maybe I'm just your typical American single girl who's jaded in all these cheesy things but marketing should be inclusive, not alienating.

You have to pay for the cable car which brings you to the top of the hill and then pay again for the tower. The views were lovely. You can see the mountains surrounding the city, the river, the modern areas, the hills - it's beautiful. The sun was setting and it was a big red ball. Everyone were taking pictures, yet there was room for all near the windows. Outside the tower there's food, there are the famous love lock ""trees"" and bench and there's a viewing platform. Also there's a fountain which is fun for children, where they can run between the streams. It's wheelchair accessible (you may need some help to overcome the slope from the top cable car station to the area around the tower).

The tower is located in a nice park and a cable car takes you right up to the lookout platform. There is some climbing involved, so wear comfortable shoes. While we were there, there was a cultural performance that was entertaining. There is also a gift shop inside with some nice souvenirs. The best part, however, is the spectacular panoramic view of the city. Be sure and visit on a clear day to take full advantage of this bird's eye view.","Written October 3, 2014"

The 2nd floor terrace which is free of charge are full of love locks and reminded us of shrines in India where pilgrims and love birds tie the thread. Many visitors bought a lock, wrote a message and locked at those grill. Then we purchased combo tickets for observatory and museum. There are two museums for trick photography. Then we went to Observatory by elevator. View of Seoul from observatory from all sides was wonderful and the sight of river Han flowing across the sprawling city was a great experience. Now it was about to sunset and so we decided to stay for an hour more. Oh yes! it was a thrilling moment to view the same city after sunset. I must say that one should visit the in the summer around 6 pm before sunset to have experience of both day and sunset views.

There are a number of restaurants where you can have your food while enjoying the breathtaking view. For a better view, you can go the observatory at the top which will cost you 9000 Korean won (which I won't recommend).

We got to the tower at around 8pm and the lift queue was ok, but the level 3 gallery was quite busy - and there are lots of shops/outlets up there, keeping the floor space quite small.  Plenty of food options at and around the tower, ranging from Korean to Western; Teddy Bear Museum basically a shop, seemingly full of mainland tour groups.  Biggest queue was for the cable car heading up to the tower, where we waited around 20 mins, but I guess that was near peak time, at close to dusk.

I chose the bus, cheaper and more convenient. From the bus stop near the tower you need to walk down a hill for about 200 meters before reaching the ticket desk. The price of the ticket is expensive in my opinion, leads to the tower through a ticket number, as there is a high influx of visitors, for example, if 50 people get out no more than 50 people can get in. You reach the top of the tower with an ultra-fast elevator, the view from up there is fantastic, Seoul from the top is amazing.

We did not go up the tower though, as we didn't want to queue. Couples can purchase locks and put it up at the fencing. It would be more economical to buy a return ticket for the cable car. Another alternative is to take the bus up, which cost a fraction of the price. It is interesting to take the Namsan Oreumi to get to the cable car station. From Myeongdong Station, Exit 4, walk straight to Hoehyeon intersection to get to Namsan Oreumi. There's also a lot of eateries there.

Now about practical aspects, there are four ways to Namsan Cable Car station - by taxi, bus, walk (hike) or lift from below. The lift is the cheapest and most convenient but the lift entrance is quite inconspicuous (others should be able to lead you to it if you ask, it's right by the Namsan tunnel). Since the cable car is quite slow, expect a very long queue particularly at night time or weekends. They will shut the ticket office and reopen when the queue is shorter. Then, the taxi drivers - NOT all will use the meter so be careful. They will charge you 20k-30k won for a relatively short time to the city centre and they have all colluded. City officials shouldn't have let this happen but hey, what rights do tourists have anyway :) So take the lift down and catch a taxi from there - you'll save loads, trust me.","Written July 1, 2014"

I am a runner, and have completed 8 half marathons, and even myself and husband chose to take the bus. The hike is all uphill and windy, so I recommend you get transportation to get to the top where all the shops, food, and view is.  Once we got there the views were panoramic, we could see mountains, water, and a 360 degree view of the city skyline. Breathtaking. There was also something really special that was new to the tower the last 2 years or so. They had locks for purchase and you can lock it to the fence or metal tree and throw away the key. The love lock, you get to write a personal message about someone you love as well, so my husband and I bought a $9 USD lock and wrote our messages to one another on each side and placed it on the fence with the other thousand or so locks that begun to pile up.

To me, all three of these towers feel the same. The view isn‚Äôt that spectacular either, just a typical city view.

1124,Lisa L,1.0,I just visited the tower and I did not like it at all. The whole view is pretty but it took forever for us to get up to the tower. We arrived at the cable cart ride at 7pm and as it is summer there was still some light. There was a loooong queue to get on the cable. (Note no plural) thats right for a technological advance country that is hugely populated with both citizens and tourist the cable cart ride only has 1 (ONE) cable cart to take you up to the tower and another one back down it. The posters or pictures of the cable cart is so misleading. Theres only a total of 2 cable carts for a group of 20-25 sardines opps i mean people swashed in. Seriously what was Korea thinking when they designed it. So we queued to purchase tickets and then queued again for the cable cart. Once when we finally reached to the top it was 9pm. Thats right 9pm a whole 2 hours of queueing. Then we bloody had to queue again to purchase tickets to go up the tower which took another half an hour. We got our tickets at 9:30pm and was told that all the resturants were closed so no food was available. There goes our dinner. We had to eat in a cafe (A Twosome place cafe) muffins and scones. Not what we wanted especially since we wanted to eat at the dinner at the Ngrill. All other food shops were closing and only drinks were available. So we only purchased the observatory deck tickets which AGAIN we had to wait 50min to get on the elvator and up the tower. So just over 10 pm we were up the tower for only 20-30 min and only to queue again to go back down onto the cable cart. then we caught a taxi to take us back to our hotel for room service dinner at 12pm.  So all i can say that the N Seoul Tower was not worth the long queue and wait. Be prepared to wait as there is a long queue.

There were 100's of people milling around not really sure what to do with themselves. There was no where to sit and no one wanted to miss their turn.  We then queued for the lift which probably took about 30 mins and then we were at the top. I wasn't hugely impressed with the view. I wish I would have gone in the day time as I think the view would have been better. We then had to queue for ages again to the get the lift back down.

Before I went there, I read many reviews of other travellers here, and they said you should be ready for long queue for the cable car. So I reached the cable car entrance amost 2 hrs in advance of my dinner booking. Out of my surprise, I did not need to queue at all, I just went there, bought the ticket, then I could go up to the entrance. I waited only for a few minutes, the cable came.  I thought that the cable car would be kind of individual cabinet, but it is not. It is a big one, no seats, able to accomodate 20-25 persons standing inside.  Cable car should be the best way to go to the Tower. I saw many people coming with big tour bus, and they needed to climb up to the hill. Anyway, after I had arrived, I saw many visitors, most of them are mainland Chinese, not very crowded, but noisy.  There are several gift shops and chain restaurants, but nothing special not buy, nor nothing good to eat here. You could take a lot of pictures with the ""love locks"" if you come with your another half.  There, you could buy the ticket to the observatory which is on the 3rd floor. I do not recommend it, though the elevator is interesting. Nothing much to see in the obvservatory. There are very few souvneirs shops, but trust me, the commodities are not interesting to buy though I was ready to, and intended to buy something.  But still, you could have a lunch / dinner at the korean restaurant.  There is also a chained coffee shop, called TWOSOME+, do not go. There is only one staff, so he is always busy and impatient. He might not be good at English, and when I ordered a drink in English, he misunderstood, and gave me another thing, I requested him to exchange, he became even more impatient and the atitudes were bad !  There is a wish pool right next to the coffee shop. I could hardly see something there. Who will throw money into such ""fake"" pool??????  After spending 1 hr on this boring 3rd floor, I went to the destination of this ride - 5th floor - N Grill (french restaurant), which was perfect in service and environment and food.  The view there is wonderful.  I recommend not to go up to this tower, unless you want to spend most time at N Grill. And if you go, it is better to be dinner time. The night view is fantastics.

1128,Alyse,5.0,"I just got engaged at the N Seoul Tower on May 7th!! So maybe I'm a little biased, but regardless, this was amazing.  The only tip I have for people is to make sure you go on a non-holiday and non-weekend. Our first attempt was interesting. It was a holiday and we were not aware of this. The lines to get anywhere were horribly long. We didn't think it would be bad to just walk up to the tower ourselves (WRONG!) so we did... and I was in heels. So we were kind of cranky once we finally got to the top because once we got there, the restaurants were ALL full and the wait for the observation deck was over an hour. So - apparently proposal attempt #1 failed (I had no idea my, now fiance, had a ring in his pocket the whole time!).  Our second attempt two evenings later was amazing. NO line for the cable car, perfect dinner at the HanCook Korean Restaurant (which is in the tower by the observation deck... since we were visiting a restaurant, we got to go to the observation deck for no extra charge), and we did the Locks of Love in the plaza as well. Couples - bring a pad lock. This tradition is really neat :).  Definitely don't miss this attraction - just know when to go and make sure you make a reservation at the restaurant you want to eat at, just in case there's a crowd! If you want a good workout, don't use the cable car and hike up the steps. The views on the way are nice, too and you can see the sunset on your way up if you go in the evening, which I feel is the best time to go also. Just don't hike in heels ;)","Written May 13, 2014"

The walk up is quite strenuous if you are not in good shape and can take anywhere from 30min to 90 if you need to stop a lot (most people I think take 45-50). There is also a cable car up but we did not take it. The tower is best to visit in early evening so you can see the sun set over the great city of Seoul and then see the city lit up at night. The crowds are quite heavy and if you want to go up, get tickets in advance, make restaurant reservations or get there early and be prepared to sit for a while until your time comes. There is a nice gift shop as well where you can buy a lock, write on it and attach it to the wall or trees which are to signal your eternal love.

It's definitely not the best/coolest tower I've been too, as CN Tower (Toronto, CAN) still ranks in my top 3. I describe it more as a short tower on a big hill. As well, we couldn't see jack from the view as it was extremely hazy.  There were plenty of activities on the plaza as it was kind of touristy. As we were about to leave the first time, they started setting up for a martial show which turned out to be pretty cool. Other than that, I was ready go. Not much to see, overcrowded, and hazy.  If you're in Seoul, I do recommend you check out the tower. It's kind of like Hollywood, you got to see it once. Maybe you'll have better luck/viewing than we did. Cheers.","Written April 13, 2014"

At the top you can buy postcards with postage (request an extra stamp for delivery to the U.S.) and mail them from the tower. My boys enjoyed writing postcards to their friends.

There is also a 'padlock' corner where you can write stuff and pad lock it to the bars and take pictures etc. The top is almost like a park, where you can relax. I think I saw people having picnics too which is a good idea. You can also buy food up there, I didnt purchase anything so can't comment on the price. I also only ventured outside.

1149,JaniceSoh,2.0,"We went on a Monday night..followed a blog entry directions and got lost instead...we walked up a super super duper long slope and climbed stairs to finally reached the cable car station!! By right, the directions should be: While facing Pacific Hotel (and still on the main road), turn your body to the right and walk straight all the way on the main road (with no slopes at all) for about 10 mins till you see a tall building with ""Woori Bank"" (as seen in my picture) then turn left onto a slope. While walking about at most 5 mins on the slope, you should see an elevator, take it and voila, you will reach the cable car station easily!!  Cable car round trip tix = 8500 won. It is only about 5 mins ride up but you have to queue as the cable car staffs will wait for more people before starting the ride.  You will then have to climb a flight of stairs up to the foot of N Seoul Tower!  N Seoul Tower admission: 9000 won each, you can also take a picture when you first enter the N Seoul Tower and buy it at 15k (for two pictures).  Night view of Seoul is nice (but not really that magnificent). The view is also kinda disappointing with the poorly maintained glass which you either see fingerprints or be distracted by the many lights behind you due to the souvenirs shop. I think it is such a letdown. They should just have a space for an observatory deck and have the souvenirs shop somewhere else.  Nevertheless, a tower at each country is my must-go! However, N Seoul Tower is not one of the best tower i have gone to.  Anyway, go if you love having a bird eye view of the city! The admission is also considered quite cheap.","Written March 2, 2014"

We visited at night time and the views were indeed spectacular, even the cable car ride up to the tower was great! (Note that you have to get separate tickets to ride the cable car then to access the tower itself) Once at the top the view is already amazing from several lookout points, and it was really entertaining to see the projected videos/shows onto the tower. There are what appear to be millions of 'love' padlocks chained to the surrounding fences and the theme continues with romantic benches and statues; so I'd imagine it would be a very cool place to visit with a partner. There are a few nice cafes and even a teddy bear museum (afraid we didn't visit!) to name a few of the additional things you can get up to, not to mention the entire surrounding area is gorgeous, especially lit up in the evening - definitely worth a visit!","Written February 5, 2014"

From there you can take cable car to go to the tower base.(Return ticket for cable car is 8500 KRW) About Tower : If you are visiting this tower, you should take out at least 2-3 hours of your busy schedule.Also visit this place during sunset so that you can enjoy Seoul view both in daylight and during night. Entry fee for Observatory is 900 KRW. Following things you must do: - Go to Observatory, find your country location and take a picture. - If you are travelling with your kids then you should visit Teddy Bear Museum. - Check timing of light shows. It is i guess at 8pm and 9.pm. You should attend this - Enjoy the romantic base of the tower  To Eat : - There is some food available at the base of the tower as well as on Observatory.

You'll see them seated in benches whispering sweet nothings to each other. It was cold and windy that night in September, 2013. Really a good time for couples in love. Another attraction we visited was the Teddy Bear Museum. It was awesome seeing them in all sizes, in different costumes, various themes and some, in action.

1177,Rob Clayson,4.0,"The North Seoul tower is an excellent way to get good views of the city. We first travelled to Myeong-dong station (line 4 light blue) & exited on #3 which by luck put us right at the transfer bus ( free) up to the cable car ride to the tower. You just have to wait untill the bus is full before it goes. It runs every half our, so just wait if you think you have missed it. It is a green & yellow mini bus. The cable car is one big car that takes about 20-30 people (which is well legal) & it's KRW8000 for a return trip each adult. Once you arrive at the top of the cable car ride it's a reasonable climb ( a million steps according to my missus) to the tower. By going this way there is no disabled access but you can access the Tower by the Seoul City Tour bus if you are getting around in a wheel chair. Once at the Tower there is a variety of things to look at even if you don't want to go up into the viewing platform. There were performers of different sorts, viewing platform, & shaded trees to sit under. The entrance fee to the top of the tower is KRW9000 each for an adult. I thought it was KRW20000 each but when i bought the tickets it was only KRW18000 for both of us-bargain!!!. The ride to the top of the tower is quick & there is a corny video to watch to take your mind of the ride. The view form the tower is quite good but i would suggest being there on a smog free day or you won't have much to look at. Even when we went it was a very nice day but visibility was about 5-10KM. Plenty of trinkets to buy & there is the usual super imposed photo in front of the tower. Quite easy to dodge that one as we didn't speak Korean.You can spend as much time as you like up there & the ride down is as quick as going up.

I don't know if it was frequent, however when we got to the base of the tower, there was a lovely show going after the top of the tower(projected electronically from a screen) which was loud, but, nonetheless nice. There are plenty of souvenir shops and right about there you get your tour packages. You can go to the Teddy Bear Museum etc. However, the Teddy Bear Museum did get quite tedious.

Two ways getting there: a cable-cart ride which takes about 4-5 minutes or a walk up, which many locals prefer as its free and healthier rather then the cable-cart.

1192,sabkhong,4.0,Locks left by lovers hoping to lock their relationship forever filled the railings of N Seoul Tower. Beautiful sight with benches that are bended in the middle. Great place for photo taking. We took the cable car up and visited the teddy bear museum inside as well. Very cute and informative about the history of Korea during the Joseon and Silla era. We were there during Summer and Korea kind of conserves energy a lot so the place is rather stuffy without much air condition and it's really hot and humid. Try to go when it isn't that cloudy. We went all the way up but it was too cloudy to have a good view of the entire city. Beautiful nonetheless. :),"Written August 13, 2013"

1194,TEI E,4.0,"We spent the better part of the day at the N-Seoul Tower and we really enjoyed ourselves. If you go to the website, you may be hesitant to use public transportation getting there, but it's a must. Privately owned cars are not allowed to enter the area, and if you really want to park at the very bottom of this hill and hike it up, good luck. The public bus will drop you off at the upper parking lot, leaving about 1/4-1/2 mile walk up to the tower. Be warned, this walk is not for the faint of heart, you will definitely earn it - it's a steep one. Once you reach the top, there two ways you can go about the view; 1) pay the full price, go inside the tower and ride the elevator to the top. Here you will enjoy views from the very top of the tower, a few gift shops, and easy access to several of the restaurants 2) you can save your money (about 37,000 won for the five of us), and walk around the terrace and take a good look out at Seoul. You already on top of a mountain and you can see all the way out to the horizon. Having said that, we paid. We've taken on this, ""if we are going, we are going all the way"" mentality and that's just what we do. We ate at the burger joint at the base of the tower, very reasonably priced, a good burger, but not the best in Seoul, not even close. The Cold Stone Creamery at the base of the tower was a welcomed surprise as the day was very warm. The cultural dancing outside on the grounds, the variety of restaurants, and the ceiling in the elevator were all pros. The grounds surrounding the tower are beautiful. So, on the cheap, bring your own picnic - there are several areas to sit and enjoy, walk around the tower and enjoy the view, and take in as many of the cultural dancing/singing exhibits as provided....total cost to you would be 0 won. If you're in it to win it, buy the tickets, eat at the local restaurant, top it off with some Cold Stone Creamery, and hit a couple stores on the way out. Either way, you will enjoy the trip, we did. Couple tips - the 3 bus in Seoul will take you right up to the parking lot area. The wait for the elevator down will probably be 3 times longer than the wait going up. We ordered several items at the burger joint with a couple requests, ie. no pickles, no onion, hot dog plain. The fella taking the order said no problem but when we received the food, it came out exactly the way it was on the menu. Give yourself 2-3 hours to take your time and enjoy.","Written August 11, 2013"

We got some unique items there, such as engraved rings (in Korean). I would skip planning to eat there though. We ate at the Italian restaurant, which had great ambiance, and was perfect for a date night as it had little couches for 2 surrounding the windows looking out, but the food wasn't great and was a little pricey.

The entire location is based around love and romance so really I recommend couples to go here. If its cloudy its not recommended to go atop the tower, as the clouds often hit the top of the tower but not as much the base.

You can visit the place after the Namsangol Hanok Village, the yellow bus number 2 or 3 outside the village, in front of the Popeye Restaurant.

1217,Jen L,3.0,"During my first visit, I was running around like crazy. What a pretty tower. What a pretty park. I bought a lot of souvenirs and took so many pictures -- I was really amazed. Unfortunately, I arrived too close to last admission at the Teddy Bear Museum so I told myself to come back.  I went back ten months later and noticed some things:  1. When it's too cold, it's not as fun. Part of the fun is marveling at the park surrounding the tower and the lights that paint the tower walls. When it's 2 degrees Celsius, it's hard to stand outside to enjoy the mountain air or check out the lovers' locks on the fences. Once you leave the warmth of the buildings, all you want to do is hide in another warm place. Cold night = misery.  2. There aren't that many food choices. There's a fancy dinner place, a burger place and the al fresco dining place. I don't know why I thought we could have dinner there. If you're not into pastas and burgers, you could have a problem. We went to the burger place and the food was so-so. The fries were good, and they sold pink lemonade, so it wasn't a total loss. Still, we would have been better off eating before we went up.  3. I need to warn you about taking the cable car when it's cold. The best way to leave the cable car station at the base on Mt. Namsan is to walk to the Namdaemun/Myeongdong area. We couldn't do this in the cold and decided to take a cab instead. The cab driver that was available asked us to pay USD 20 for a three minute ride. Don't ever go for this! Cab drivers in Seoul are generally honest so this was an exception, but it could happen to you, too, so please be careful.  Now that I've seen the Teddy Bear Museum, I think this last time was it for me. No need to go back. Twice is just right -- but if you actually get to see the Teddy Bear Museum the first time, once might be enough, too.","Written May 13, 2013"

1227,LJDS27,4.0,"We heard that the lights at night were an amazing sight, but we chose to go there after lunch to see the details of the city. We had lunch first in Myeongdong then walked up going to the cable car. The cable car ride costs KRW6000 for a one-way ticket and KRW8000 for a return ticket. We purchased the one way ticket so we can experience the trail going down the mountain. There was still a bit of a climb going up but there were areas that you can rest, take pictures, buy snacks and enjoy the view.  A major to-do in this site especially for couples is to leave a lock with a love message. You can choose to leave the message in the fence or in metal trees. There really is no rule on how to leave your message -- we saw a lot of curious things attached to the fences such as cellphone cases, lunchboxes, keychains, etc. I already brought a used metal padlock from Manila, but we needed to buy a permanent marker and chose a waterproof bagtag from the souvenir shop to write our message. If you don't have a lock, the souvenir shop sells different colored locks (surely more expensive had you purchased it at your local hardware store).  We bought the bundle package tickets to the Observatory and the Teddy Bear museum (KRW14000/adult). The Teddy Bear museum was a cute way to learn about Seoul's history and the Observatory gives you probably the best panoramic view of Seoul. Near the ticketing area, there's a traditional Korea martial arts demonstration that happens every 3pm. Quite cool to watch.  Going down was a very light hike. This was the same trail you'd take if you will not take the cable car, but judging from the facial expressions of those going up they looked very exhausted halfway up.  The whole experience took about 4 hours to complete, but I'd think some people would probably take much longer if they will choose to eat in the restaurant there.","Written April 10, 2013"

The cable car ride was about 3 mins long and cost around 4000 won. Highly recommended for the immense views! Also to enter and climb the tower you also need to pay around 8000 won. At the base of the tower you can enjoy stunning views over seoul whilst enjoying the mass volume of 'Love locks' that are secured to the railings. I also enjoyed a banging hot dog in one of the restaurants as I waited for a ring to be engraved. I highly recommend the whole experience to anyone who visits Seoul!,"Written December 9, 2012"

Next, the observatory just didn't feel special. There wasn't a 'look-down' window so you can get the thrill of being suspended in the air. And unless I missed it, there was nothing to point out the major sites of the town.  Sorry... but I wasn't too impressed with the tower.

You will wait over 2 hours in the evening-even as late as 11 PM to get a chance to go up ($10 a person, $12 for the audio kit-cheaper for kids). The last tickets sold are like 10ish I beleive. Everyone is up there and if you want to for sure go up, plan on something to do while you wait. There is a gorgeous pagoda all lit up to see under, benches, Cold Stone Creamery, a few expensive restaurants and a small convienent store. There are package deals to eat dinner and see the Teddy Bear place. I did not do either. I did use the green bus to get to the tower, as well as the cable car to get down. The cable car ride is gorgeous at night and worth the ride down. Make sure you get in at the front, so you can see the steep descent down. The line will be very long for this as well-often times. The cable car is at capacity of about 30 people and you will be cramped.  At the top you can see behind the ticket box, a terrace with this really cool art project about lovers. Bring your camera and take lots of photos. You can get a decent photo there of Seoul.  At the top in the park area is also a typical style drinking fountain with multiple spouts for water and also plenty of bathrooms.  The green electric bus will drop you off near the top but, everyone has to walk the steep incline up about another 200 yards to get to the actual base of the tower.  I did hike it up from Dongik University to the Seoul Tower park. Its about a 7 KM walk up a 30% inline......gorgeous wooded paths on pavement and steps.

The price for the one-way cable car ride and access to the top of the tower is what you would expect for a tourist attraction, but it is over-priced compared to other activities (Korean National Museum, Korean War Memorial, Korean Folk Musuem, etc.) You can pay extra to visit the Teddy Bear museum (our boys weren't interested) and their are several snack shops and restaurants if you want to eat there.

It could be because there wasn't much to look out for when at the top. The view at every angle seemed the same to me. Perhaps it could be better if there was a guide pointing out the landmarks to spot when viewing from a certain part of the tower. The only prominent feature I could identify was probably the Han River.  There are also hourly light shows that will be beamed on the tower itself, starting from 8 pm. But honestly, you can skip it and head straight for the tower. It is nothing fanciful.  The place, like every tourist attraction, is full of people, and waiting time to get up to the viewing gallery can span up to 30 minutes (and that was when I visited on a weekday), so I suggest that you avoid weekends or public holidays, which in my opinion, will take even longer.  TIP: Tower admission fees are 9000 won for adults, but you can enjoy a 10% discount if you use the coupon provided when you purchase a Seoul City Pass Plus (their public transport card, but specially for foreigners) card.

1317,tsubasani237,5.0,"I visited the tower on my last night in Seoul. It's close to Myeong-Dong (one of the biggest and most popular shopping districts) and the Seoul cathedral is also in the same locality. There are a lot of helpful tour guides around who speak English, Japanese, and Korean, and are really willing to share a map and give directions.  From Myeong-Dong it's about a 15 minute walk, up a bit of a slope, to the cable-car. There's a charge for the cable car (and then the elevator at the tower) but it is not very expensive, and you can use Visa card if you want.  It's also possible to walk up a pleasant tree-lined path to the top, and back again, though I was a bit short on time and so I didn't do that this time..  I went up just before sunset (7:40pm this time of year) so I was able to enjoy seeing the sky change from light blue to dark blue to black, and all the twinkling lights coming out.  There are loads of cute souvenirs, and you can write a post-card from the tower, which they will mail for you. There are restaurants at tower also, which aren't as cheap as other places in Seoul, but as most things in Seoul are relatively inexpensive, it's probably one of the least expensive towers to dine at.  I recommend visiting the tower, especially for the amazing feeling of seeing such a huge and populated city from such a great height - it really changes your perspective!!","Written May 11, 2012"

Like other reviewers stated there are buses and tramway that take you up. one side note is that the buses only take you soo far. There is a parking lot for the buses and from there on its on you to make it all the way up. I havent read all the reviews but some might not know that there is a park area up the street that takes you up to the tower and there is a stairway up to the tower. the starway starts from the hilton that is nearby. The park is more like a outdoor rustic gym. Saturday and Sunday morning the locals like to go up the stairway or up the street to the park and get there workout. I used to run the whole thing from where I lived. It took me a while to do the whole thing without stopping, but the view on top is worth it.

There is a cable car at Namsam that brings you up to the tower, or take the bus (Cable car is 8000W for a return trip or 2400W for a bus ride)  The area under the tower is great, it has food stalls, and some great places to take pictures, sit down, chat and talk, the ambiance is great. The views are breathtaking, go at night, on a clear night and you can see pretty much all of Seoul.  There is a souvenir shop, a minimart and several restaurants.  There's an hourly light show on tower, that was fun to watch.  The keychain memorial was pretty unique and good to see.

I recommend going from the cable car. It's about 8000 KRW for the round trip and 6000 KRW for single ride. So what do you do there once reach the tower?....ENJOY! Yes, taking photos and enjoy the views. You can also place your locks which is symbolizing your etenal love with your partner - but don't throw the key down from the tower! Lots of people do that and there is warning sign not to do so! On the tower there is teddy bear museum and cafe. You can buy a ticket to the upper level of the tower.

1326,AvidHolidayMum,3.0,"Initially was planning to walk from Myeongdong Metro Station passing Pacific hotel to the cable car station (for the cable car that takes you up to N Seoul Tower) until other reviewers mentioned about the steep walk. We cleverly avoided it by taking advantage of the free shuttle bus from our hotel (IBIS Ambassador Myeongdong). The bus took us right to the cable car station. On the way back, we did the walk down from the cable car station to the Myeongdong station and yes I can imagine it to be very tiring going uphill.  Cable car costs Won 8000 for adult and Won 5000 for child return. There is another separate entrance fee for going up the N Seoul Tower - Won 9,000 for adult and Won 5,000 for child. At the base of the tower, before taking a lift up, your photographs will be taken behind a plain backdrop and superimposed onto a day scene and a night scene. Costs Won 12,000 for both photos or Won 10,000 for one. There is also a Teddy Bear museum which we didn't have time for.  At the top of the N Seoul tower, there are windows showing distances to different parts of the world e.g. Auckland NZ, 9,582.19 km. You can walk one round 360 degrees. The toilets have good views too. People seemed to love buying postcards and posting them into the mail box provided. There is a shop selling souvenirs.  Outside the tower, at the base, are shops and an area (fence and trees) filled with different coloured locks. Apparently couples come to lock their love eternally. There are also 2 guards in colourful costumes watching the tower. My sons enjoyed playing the traditional Tuho game (where you throw sticks trying to get them into holes of poles).  I dropped my return cable car tickets but by some miracle found them near the spot where I lost them. Some kind soul must have picked them up and put them safely in one of the holes in the side wall.

Once inside Namsan Park, it takes 45-60 minutes to walk up to the top, where you can buy a ticket to go to the observation decks inside the tower. The path mainly consists of stone steps, and running shoes are recommended.

There are a w restaurants (one American, one Chinese, and one Italian ) that you can enjoys while waiting for the perfect time to go to the observation deck.

It may not be as funny if you are traveling alone, but for a group of four after a few beers, we definitely were highly entertained. The view from the observation deck at night is awesome.

I went up in the cable car from the bottom of the hill, but the cars can get very crowded and if I go again I would walk - at least down the hill! There are restaurants at the base of the tower that are reasonably priced and you can get a cool beer if you do walk up from the bottom of the hill! The queues for the tower itself were fairly quick-moving, and just before you go up in the elevator, there is an excellent lightshow of Seoul viewed from the tower. Obviously if you go up in the day, you won't have seen the lights of the city, so this is a good compromise. Once on the viewing platform, I was surprised to find it was multi-level and reasonably spacious. It does offer a 360 degree look across the city and surroundings and you finally see just how huge Seoul really is. The park the tower stands in is nice and it was a pleasant surprise for me how many locals smiled and nodded as I walked around.

And we were lucky to be there in late afternoon so we saw the lights coming on at dusk around the city-you can make out the arteries- streets, bridges because they are completely lit up by cars stuck in the perennial traffic jam. Though a complete tourist trap, if you do want an overview of the hugh metropolis that is Seoul this place is definitely worth a visit. Other than that I do have one more recommendation: Do not miss out on the view from the washroom. (I am speaking for the gents..For a similar experience/view comparable to this, you have to go to the top of a medieval hill town village hundreds of feet above the Mediterranean- Eze, in the Cote d'Azur. The washroom of the restaurant/cafe called the ""golden goat"") While coming down the hill we unwittingly got into a fake taxi that was waiting there to trap foreign tourists. This was the only time in Korea when we got robbed in a cab. (In general our experience with taxis in Korea had been good) A journey to Itaewon that should cost around 5000 won(about $5) turned into ten times as much.( Hint: You try to get into a parked cab. The driver points you to a car behind. You assume that is also a legitimate taxi. It does have a meter. Only one that wouldn't stop jumping for even a split second.

1386,Krubee,5.0,"Wonderful, Romantic and Memorable that's what we've experience visiting N Seoul Tower or Namsan Seoul Tower. In the chilly dusk of November in Seoul, we went here via Bus #3 in Chungmuro station exit 4. The ride took about 30 mins because it's the rush hour and many stops so if you would like a faster way to get here can take the Namsan Cable car or taxi or you could hike to the tower itself. Takes around 1,100 won one way and it is the last stop in its route. There are many tourists in the entrance and buses both public and tour buses and parked there so it tends to get busy. Indeed, it is one of the most visited attractions in Seoul. Standing high at 774 ft it is an observation and communications tower and the second highest in Seoul. It is my second time to visit this place but this time during the day. My first time in 2016 it was at night and we went on top of the observation deck inside the tower overlooking Seoul from Namsan Mountain where its located right at the heart of Seoul. The ticket costs around 11,000 KRW. This time around 2019 we didn't go inside but we visited the base of the tower which surrounded by the beautiful Namsan park and its wide array of trees that include Maple, Pine, Ginko, Cherry blossoms and many more. Since its fall the colors are full of Red, Yellow, Orange, White and Brown truly mesmerizing, eye catching, romantic and beautiful. We took a lot fo beautiful photos and videos before these blooming trees in the colours of Autumn. Up here you will have a panoramic view of Seoul - its skyscrapers, buildings, castles, villages and rivers. It is indeed a magical view for us. You don't even need to go up the observation deck. Another great feature we did is the Lock Padlocks where tourists and local couples put their padlocks as a key of their endearing love for each other. You could write your names and buy the key/padlock from the minimart inside N Seoul Tower. We indeed put our padlock in the midst of thousands of locks placed in this mountain. The Lock Padlocks also offer a great panoramic view of Seoul, the Tower and Namsan Park. We left just before night falls via bus and it was a short yet memorable visit for us. It is indeed of the best and beautiful destinations in Seoul so please do come visit when you arrive here in Seoul, Korea.","Written December 16, 2019"
1387,Winston Chuah,4.0,"Like any tower in the world, N Seoul Tower has its own unique attractions. Located on the top of Namsan mountain, it offers breathtaking 360-degree views of Seoul city. There are 2 public transportation options to get there via cable car or bus. Via the cable car, there is no immediate subway access and you'll need to walk up the hill from Myeongdong subway station. Mind you, if you're traveling with young children or elderly, this can pose a challenge. Or you can take bus No. 02, No. 03 and No. 05.  Once at the base of the tower, the area is clean and pleasant to visit. Don't miss out on the love padlocks near the tower base for nice photo-taking opportunities.

The ride was smooth, but the view from the car and from the tower is nothing special. We went there in the night expecting nice views, but there is too much light which prevents us from getting a good view of the city (see picture).

1415,Dawn S,4.0,"Lots of development around the tower over the past several years. My favorite way to get there is walking one of the many paths through the woods. I get lost every time I go so I will not try to give directions. Other options to the tower are cable car and bus. There is are shuttle buses that regularly circle loops between popular tourist destinations - this is easy and convenient. The tower now has many little shops, restaurants, coffee shops... plenty of snacks and trinkets to buy even without buying a ticket to go up the tower. This is nice in case you are there on a cloudy day when it‚Äôs not worth the $$ to go up the tower. Also plenty of photo ops and opportunity to get a love lock or leave your cell phone cover on the fences (not sure what this is all about)... visit the hello kitty island, etc. a trip up the old radio tower is quite spectacular - they have a neat light display before the fast elevator ride to the viewing floor. On the observation floor there are signs to let you know what you are seeing, pretty amazing views on a clear day, and (of course) shops to buy snacks and souvenirs. It‚Äôs been ages since we visited the restaurants up in the tower. It was a nice experience however, limited vegetarian options and not really great for little children. Overall a good place to visit, better on a clear day, wonderful to get a little exercise if you have the time and ability.

You could, if you‚Äôre trying to save money. But you would probably be too tired to hike down that you‚Äôre most likely going to end up taking the cable car on your way down again anyway. There is a separate ticket to get in to the namsan tower itself. It is not expensive so we did it. I was glad we did, as it gave us a 360 degree view of the city.

There is also a kids play area, stores for souvenirs or snacks, obviously the observation tower, statues and figures to take pictures of, and many rest stops along the way. Although the observation tower is a good view of the surrounding area, you can also get the view when just looking from the view point areas from outside the tower which is free.","Written June 22, 2019"

There are several restaurants should you feel hungry and want to eat. There is a convenience store for your basic needs. If you are travelling with very small children and elderly, it may be a challenge walking up the steep hill leading to the tower. There is a portion there where there are trees where you can attach your lock as a remembrance until the next time you visit the tower. The best way to reach the top is by car, if not, bus. Taxi's are not allowed so it's a longer walk by cab. If you go up there during the colder months of the year, bring a jacket, the cold is felt very much at that height.","Written June 7, 2019"

After getting off the cable car, you can already see colorful ‚Äúlove locks‚Äù all over; you can place your own. (If you don‚Äôt have a lock they sell it there.) You can also take photos of the Tower from that area. Then there is an option to pay to get up the N tower itself. Since we didn‚Äôt want to eat another buffet meal, we only got the tickets with pizza and pasta meal for 2 (not at the top of the tower though), but the pizza especially was superb. At the tower itself, we didn‚Äôt need to stay long; 15-20 minutes was more than enough.

Once you arrive on the other side, there are lots of picture spots and also an area where couples place locks with their names written on it (like in Paris).  On the top of the tower, you have a 360 degree view of Seoul from viewing platform.

Interesting fact - the tower itself uses lights to indicate whether the visibility is clear or not, so its a good practice to watch for the lights and then make your way there. You can get to the base of the tower for free, which itself is good enough to get a splendid view. But if you want to spend money, you can pay more and make your way up the tower which as a restaurant with a better 360 view. There are two ways to get there - you can trek your way up a nice path or take the bus.

We saw lots of cars parking at the end of the 1st part and some cars parked at the tower. From some reviews, we gathered there is a bus which we could have taken.  The view on top was great. The space at the observatory is not big and I was surprised to see quite a no of people.  There are quite a few restaurants and cafes at the tower.

However, on those good viewing days my schedule would not permit a visit here to the N. Seoul Tower, located within Namsan Park, here in Seoul, South Korea. Then I looked into taking a tour to the N. Seoul Tower. The price was prohibitive. However the booking agent for the tour told me that their bus would go to the base of the N. Seoul Tower. My friends who live here said that you have to walk up a long walk to get to the base of the tower.  So I hired a taxi and off we went on a dark, gray, overcast and snowy day to see the N. Seoul Tower. I expected the taxi would take me to the top, to the base of the tower. This was not the case at all. I saw the snow covered walk leading up a hill and had to decline a visit.  Disappointing? Yes indeed. But my timing was lousy and I had to be at the airport and won't have another chance to visit the N. Seoul Tower until who knows when.  What is the point of this review?

Just before the tunnel, and on the north-eastern side, we unexpectedly discovered that there is a cable-car that takes you from the aforementioned road level, up to the very large park that surrounds the actual tower itself. This saves you a somewhat steep walk up to the tower park... but if you're into exercise then by all means skip this free ride and walk up instead. It's quite steep.  There is also road access to the tower and surrounding park that comes in from the south, and I assume that you can get a cab up, and there are many coach day tours that can also get you to this park and the tower.  There is a LOT to see in the surrounding park, even before you decide to take the lift up the tower itself. The landscaped area surrounding the tower has many restaurants, fast food outlets, souvenir shops, and lookout platforms.The views even just from these large viewing platforms is very impressive, and you can spend an hour or more here, depending on whether there are special events, displays, and/or entertainment on the day of your visit, before you even consider taking the lift up to the top of the tower itself.  But the main purpose of your visit still must include a ride in the fast vertical lifts to the tower viewing platforms where you get a 360-degree view of Seoul. Quite spectacular. Again, shops and food outlets on this high viewing platform.  And... (I can only speak for the male visitors...) DO make a point of visiting the male toilets here! Men... you can stand at a narrow urinal against what is effectively a glass wall, and take in the stunning views of Seoul as you relax and relieve.... and... even taking photographs from the men's toilets are encouraged.  A visit to the N Seoul Tower should be a mandatory port of call if you have never visited Seoul before.","Written December 14, 2018"

Fun fact: Our guide told us that if the tower in lit Green meaning the atmosphere is clear of the microdirt and the air is clean. Other colors such as blue and red, indicates a different reading.

1627,I Love Bergen,4.0,"Spent the day hiking and visiting the N Seoul Tower.  GETTING THERE Yes, there is a cable car. But the hike is very easy - it's reasonably flat and you get pretty good views all the way up. Once at the tower, you need to buy a ticket to go to the observation deck. There is a shopping mall below, so choose to visit that either before or after the observation deck. Then you join the queue, get your photo taken (optional), and then take the lift to the top. Once at the top, there are three different floors full of restaurants and shops.  Tip: If you have Lonely Planet, they have an excellent self-guided walking tour that's very easy to do. It includes a visit to the Old City Wall.  CROWDS It's *so* crowded. Be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes in queues for food, shops, and finding a spot to take photos.  VIEWS Incredible!  Tip: Want to get good views but be away from crowds? We went to the Hancook restaurant where it was VERY quiet. We then sat there, ate slowly, and watched the sunset from our own table in our own space. It's much better then nudging people out of the way on the main floors.  FOOD First we got beer + chips from a coffee shop, and the chips were laughably bad. Then we went and hid in the Hancook restaurant, which was a little overpriced but nice and quiet. We got our own table overlooking the city.  SOUVENIR SHOPPING Some of the best souvenirs I've seen in Seoul! Did all my shopping there.","Written November 22, 2018"

Very clever...  At the top I enjoyed stupendous 360¬∞ views over the complete city and way beyond. The sky was beautifully clear and you could see for miles and miles. I liked the fact that at one level you could orientate yourself to your home city/country and one level below you could spot the local sights.  The gift shop at the top was well stocked. I really appreciated the chance to buy a postcard or two with the postage stamps already inserted in the envelope. I just needed to buy an extra stamp to cover the postage back to Europe.

1705,Mrb,4.0,We were hoping to visit for sunset and glad we planned in advance. We rode the gondola up the hill rather than hiking since it was a super hot/humid summer day. There was about a 30-45 minute wait for the gondola ride. Once we got off the gondola we bought our tickets to the top of the tower and stood in line for only 10 minutes. Once at the top we were able to walk around and take plenty of pictures. Also bought a postcard with stamp for about $1USD to write and mail from the top of the tower. After sunset the city lights came on which was another beautiful sight. Then there was another 15 minute line to take the elevator back down to the ground. The area was fun to look at with the trees lit up. The gondola ride down was quite quick with almost no line. This is not a cheap place...I think for 2 adults we spend $50USD between the tower and gondola tickets.

It's a decent walk up the hill if you fancy a workout otherwise there are plenty of buses to take you to the base of the tower. Buy your ticket but don't expect to get admission straight away - this is a popular place and you'll be given a timed ticket. You can select straight forward admission or other packages - we went for one with popcorn and beer! Having to wait I while meant we could explore the lower levels for a bit and appreciate the architecture before we took the lift to the viewing floor.  We got there as the sun was setting so could appreciate the city by day and night. The views were impressive. Try get there so you can see the sun set from the top. You won't be dissapointed!

The night view of the Han River, the busy city of Seoul with all the lights was worth seeing. I am not too sure how I feel about the locks that seems to be a trend with young couples but I am not judging. This was one of our most memorable night in Seoul.

I don‚Äôt think that it exists anymore.  The views are phenomenal like everyone said, but I must say that the air feels so fresh and clean as well ‚Äî the forest-like experience with mist in the air felt so good in my lungs.  If I lived here again, I would probably hike here 2-3 times a week. Since I don‚Äôt, I will probably come back next week at the end of the trip.  I went to the top after several hours of the typhoon. At first, I was a bit miffed as the windows were fogged up with condensation. I debated to get a refund until I asked one of the attendants if I will be able to see the views. So I waited and the images were breath-taking.  Namsan tower captures the beauty and magnitude (population) of the city.  One thing I thought was kind of weird is the voyeuristic feeling you get when you use the restroom. You get the best views and if feel like someone is peering into your window, but you have complete freedom.  Last thing I really loved doing is too go is to watch people below look like the size of ants move around.  Here are some of my photos.","Written August 25, 2018"
1761,SurfingWild,5.0,"We visited Seoul Tower in a rainy morning and were lucky in that the place was pretty empty which we understand is quite rare. That means no queuing up for anything at all.  The visit began with walking through the world's first OLED Tunnel which is pretty amazing and the kids loved it. After purchasing tickets we took a locker to place our bags and then went up to the observation tower but first passing an area to take our photos which we paid for later. Despite that rainy weather the views were still pretty stunning.  Once downstairs there is the large area where lovers can attach their own personal padlocks with messages of love and this in itself was pretty amazing. However, on this rainy day hardly anyone was out here.  Seoul Tower is very child friendly with a Toy Museum, the LG 3D World, a place for games and a 360Degree VR Tour. In addition there are numerous restaurants and coffee shops and stores selling souvenirs.

We checked into the Pacific Hotel and walked to the Tram entrance, a short hike directly behind our hotel. The tickets were $9 each for the tram ride up and once at the base of the tower, we purchased a ticket to the observation deck of the tower. Another $9 each. The tram ride offers a great view, though I was disappointed that it wasn't air conditioned. In case you haven't heard, summer and winter weather in Seoul is extreme! The park at the base of the tower is very nice with lots of areas to sit and enjoy the view, restaurants, a bar and shopping areas. The elevator ride to the top of the Tower is quick with a fun video to keep your mind off the quickness of the ride. The observation deck has a restaurant, a bar, a candy shop and plenty of shopping. It even offers a post office with lots of fun stationary for purchase. The lines to get up/down to the park and tower are long, though it is very organized. I would suggest adding another drink machine in the staging area to the tram. There is one right before you get to the stairs.

I suggest you order the ticket from online websites before your visit as you can get cheaper price (e.g. Klook). Below the tower is the love lock place you can enter for free and a spacious park where you can also view the city from a height. There are many senior citizens visiting the place to exercise and stroll with friends.","Written July 2, 2018"
1818,A Y,3.0,"I went on a Thursday night on a bus (not many people using the bus which was good) around 8 pm. The evening was humid with some light rain. When I got to the bus terminus by the tower, the sky was still clear enough for some good night view of Seoul. By the time I got up the observation deck of the tower, it was very noisy and crowded with people, with loud music playing in the background, and bright light inside which cast strong reflections on the glass. All these kind of ruined the night view and made the visit very unatmospheric. Then mist set in and everything was shrouded. I stayed for a short time and left. I have visited quite a number of high towers in different cities and many offer great views day and night. This is probably the worst experience I have had so far. I guess it would be much better if I go during the day on a weekday when the weather is fine.","Written July 1, 2018"

Also great at daytime. It costs 10,000 won per person to get on the tower. You need to get on the cable car to get up to the NamSan Mountain, or walk. Taxi and private vehicle cannot go up to the mountain for protection of environment reason. You can use either bus or cable car. We used the cable car.

1834,SPWH2,5.0,"The tower was beautiful. Starting off its not hard to get too. If you want to take the cable car then you'll get off at Myeong-dong station and walk about 15 minutes towards the Pacific Hotel to the right. The only thing about the cable car is 1. There are very few cable cars so you won't get your own car but you'll be on it with about 15/20 other people. 2. The wait time depending on the time of day you go can take up to 30 minutes to an hour. THIS IS JUST ONE WAY btw! 3. Be prepared to spend more time waiting in line for the cable car if you decide to do round trip.  Another way you can go up is by bus which is very efficient. Buses 2,4 and 5 will take you there and from there you can walk up the hill or ramp.  Once you get up you'll see the love locks (which you can lock your lock) in numerous spots around the tower. You'll also enjoy the beautiful scenery.  I enjoyed the night view for I loved how lighted the city was and how quiet it was to just enjoy the lights, breeze and view. I also heard that going during the day was just as nice.  You don't need to go to the observatory deck to see the 360 view of the city for your able to see it below but if you want to do something extra then you can pay to do it and easily pick up your tickets. It's also best to book your tickets in advance for the observatory deck.  Overall I would recommend.","Written June 18, 2018"

The surrounding views are great on their own and doesn‚Äôt get that much better that it is worth the money. Besides up top is just a massive tourist trap.

From the lush setting to the fabulous views, it is very much worth the trip. Plus, you can take a tram to get to it. As Miranda's mum would say, ""such fun!"" Not only do you get amazing views of the city, but you can send postcards all over the world! They provide the postage. Make sure you have enough memory free on your phone - you will be taking a lot of pictures. Also, right before the elevator to the top of the tower, the staff take a picture of you that you can purchase later. Very expensive and not worth it. I saw signs that said no pictures, but everyone was. They sell popcorn like you are going to the movies, like this is an EVENT. Inside the elevator they play a short clip that you watch on the ceiling. At first I didn't understand why, but it makes sense. How awkward would it be to be crammed in a silent elevator with 10 other people trying not to make eye contact? Great for the whole family. Tons of food options too. Also, if you are with your boo, you can leave a lock on the railings like the French used to do on the Pont des Arts bridge in Paris. Very cute.","Written June 12, 2018"

There are no explanations for what you see (maybe a brief history of some key places would be great!), and I think there were no audio guides either. That's why I give this place 2 stars.

I mean of course we can see Seoul from a very high point but the night I visited the tower it was foggy (bad luck)  The thing that I didn‚Äôt like was mostly about the organisation of the visit. First of all you have to wait 10 minutes for a lift that can take 15 people max and then once you arrived up at the entrance you‚Äôll have at least to wait for 1 hour or 2 jours. You have to wait standing because there is a few sits. Then once you are up in the tower you have once again to wait for 1 hour to come back downstairs.

1933,smurphetteee,3.0,"When in Seoul, one must visit the N Seoul Tower because.. ""when in Rome"". I'm rating this a 3/5 because of the challenges my family faced when visiting this landmark:  1. We were travelling with my mum who can't walk much. According to multiple taxi drivers, they were not permitted by law to take passengers up. This meant that Mum had to slowly hike up the hill, and mind you it wasn't the easiest of hills to walk up to.  2. Again, mum couldn't walk much. There was no direct access to the top of the tower. Once we reached the hill and boarded the slanted elevator, there were still a series of stairs to climb to finally make it to the entrance of the tower. It was rather handicap-unfriendly.  3. You'd think that after all that climb, the view would be spectacular but it was pretty average. The entrance free to the viewing deck cost KRW10,000 per person and it was indoor. Perhaps I am biased but I thought The Peak in HK was a lot better, must it was outdoor and far more breath-taking.  4. Getting back down was another challenge as you can imagine.  I would still recommend this for those travelling to Seoul for the first time but probably best to go during the cold weather (otherwise you'd be sweating away), you are wearing comfortable shoes, and are not bounded by toddlers/prams/elderly.","Written April 1, 2018"

Cost 10000 for each adult to head up the tower for some beautiful views of the city. There is also a coffee shop and gift shop at the top.

I was quite surprised by this as Seoul was a very clean city and I would have expected there to be a team of people constantly cleaning them.

Long story short, it took an hour plus to get in line to buy the tickets and then wait another 40 minutes to get on the cable car to the Seoul Tower. After we got up, we waited another 30 minutes to be seated at the noodle house. Everywhere was just waiting! It was a madhouse. The gift shop was packed like sardines. This was during a weeknight around 6:30-7pm. It was just impossible to navigate around. We were able to get a few shot of the tower, but that was it. We waited in line for the cable car to get back down. And of course, we were cut in line again. Somehow I think our forehead said ""Please cut in front of us!""

Also, unless you LOVE to hike, we definitely suggest taking the cable car. I had spent about 18 days walking around South Korea so decided against walking there.  We arrived at the tower at 10:30PM, last admission for the cable car back is 11:00PM (otherwise you walk back down if you miss it) so we spread our time between looking at the sights, taking quick snaps then headed to see the love locks! Honestly 10-15 minutes up there is all you need. The love locks were most interesting for us.  The views from the tower were absolutely beautiful. It doesnt take you long at all to do a circle before you are back to where you began. Each panel has a different country listed so we were happy trying to find ours.  The Love Locks didn't disappoint. If you are a massive fan of kdramas, this is the place to visit as seen in kdramas such as Boys over flowers and My love from the star etc. When we came back down the tower, there was a wall with thousands of signatures and messages left by people from around the world who had visited so we left ours too :D Food places available there too.

Save you the walking uphill agony, esp to those elderly people. We only got to know about it on our way down! You should also get the Discover Seoul Pass since you can get into the observatory for free. Be prepared to wait for 1 hour plus to get into the cable car and another 1/2 hour to go up to the observatory. The view is superb! Worth all the queuing and waiting.

We took the subway then walked up to the elevator to take us to the cable car station. The cable car takes you up the mountain. The view from the cable car is also nice...if you are near the window. It can get really crowded in the cable car. Upon reaching the top you will walk up the stairs going to the tower. I suggest you go there before the sun sets because it will give you many beautiful photo ops. Pick your spot because you are not the only one taking pictures. Do not forget to have photos by the love locks. You can bring your own lock or you can buy there. Romantic couples will have great time there. If you get hungry, there are several restaurants / cafes by the tower. To get to the top of the Tower, you have to purchase a ticket. When you have a ticket you will line up for the lifts to take you to the viewing deck. There you can get a wide view the city. You can buy souvenirs, take photos or have dinner there. We went there at the onset of winter so it was quite cold. Timing is important. Do not leave when everyone is also leaving because it will eat up your time waiting for lifts and cable car. Bring a lot of patience... it will help. Do not let the waiting in line ruin the experience for you. A good camera will help preserve your experience there.

Since opening to the public in 1980, it has become a much-loved Seoul landmark. The tower's main attractions include multi-colored digital art projected onto the tower at night, a digital observatory, a roof terrace, the HanCook restaurant, the n.Grill restaurant, and the Haneul (Sky) Restroom. Namsan Seoul Tower's mountain surroundings on Namsan Mountain have made it a popular place to unwind for locals and tourists alike.  Seoul has a number of viewing platforms where visitors can enjoy the nighttime cityscape or gaze out onto the Hangang (River) but the tower's Digital Observatory is unique, offering an astonishing 360 degree panorama over the city, and 32 LCD screens recounting the 600-year history of Seoul. That is why the observatory is so popular and such a source of pride.  Situated on top of the N Plaza, the Roof Terrace is a spacious wooden viewing deck whose exotic atmosphere makes it very popular with lovers. A recent attraction for courting couples is ""Locks of Love,"" thousands of padlocks attached to the fence by romantic Seoulites symbolizing their undying affection.","Written December 13, 2017"

2125,Mazmannan,4.0,"Namsan Seoul Tower (or N Seoul Tower as it is commonly called) was built in 1969. It was the first tower tourist place in Korea. It was also Korea's first integrated transmission tower beaming television and radio broadcasts to Seoul. The tower opened to the public in 1980.  The tower has a digital observatory and a roof terrace. The digital observatory gives you a 360 degree panoramic view of the city. I noted a few restaurants - the HanCook, the n.Grill restaurant, and the Haneul Restroom. The roof terrace is a great viewing area. It has many padlocks attached to the fence by couples to show their love for each other. These are the ‚ÄúLocks of Love‚Äù.  The top of the tower is about 480 metres above sea level taking into consideration that Namsan Mountain on which the tower is based is 243 metres above sea level and the tower itself is about 237 metres.  You take a free ride on a funicular from street level to the cable car station. At the cable car station. you need to buy a ticket here for a cable car trip to the tower complex. You can buy a single or return ticket to the tower. A return ticket costs 8,500 Won (equivalent to about GBP 6.00 ‚Äì August 2017) When you get to the tower, you then need to buy a ticket for admission to the top of the tower ‚Äì 10,000 Won ‚Äì (equivalent to about GBP7.00 Aug 17). You can get a great view from the tower base and it is just as good as the view from the top of the tower.

There's multiple ways to get to the tower... you can take a tour bus, you can take the cable car, or you can hike. I highly encourage you to take the time to take the cable car up, and hike down, or vice-versa. The view from the top is great (but it's not near as tall as Lotte Tower, which I also highly recommend). The only downside to tower is its accessibility. I don't believe there's a parking lot to drive your own car, it's out of the way for a taxi, and it's not near a subway stop.

Getting here can be a bit tricky if you don't have a knowledgeable local to help guide you as I had during my second visit, but I was still able to find my way with my limited Korean ability during my first visit, so don't be scared! Once you're on the correct bus, it winds it's perilous way along a narrow winding road until letting you off at a stop shy of the actual summit. You're expected to walk the remaining distance to the tower itself, so wear shoes that will be comfortable for walking up a steep incline. It's a little bit of an exertion depending on your fitness level, but the views from the top are well worth it! Both of my visits have been during the night and it's breath taking. The collection of locks has grown an incredible amount since my first visit, too! Make sure to bring your own padlock to seal the bonds of your eternal love if you have someone worthy of locking down. I contributed my own lock to the collection during my last visit!

Went to check it out in Oct, it was great because the weather was good and sunny. We walked slowly up the hill to get on an elevator lift to the tower (free). Then reached mid upper hill had to buy a return ticket (or single one way up or down - can hike up or down the hill) cable ride to the tower. Negative was the staff will filled up the cable car (packed sardines :/) with enough tourists then start the ride. Enjoyed the great views but not really while in the cable car because can't move around to take pictures. When reached the hill top, there were steps to walk up. There was a lock place, where lovers can buy locks to write their wishes and locked it around the fences which was so romantic and a vending machine to sell flowers. After had to walk up few more steps up and there was a Korean dressed up guard standing there and behind 2 more guards were marching each side of the huge big vases (those were for guards to lit those big vases when enemies entered their provinces -old time). Because it was mid autumn festival, there was a stall that let visitors to put on Korean traditional costumes (free) then took pics with the guards. At the tower, visitors able to buy just visit the tower platform, or tickets that include hello kitty museum and comic characters museum. Both museums are small but kids loved them so much. Up to the viewing plateform, the views were magnificent and spent long time to see how Seoul formed. Seoul was surrounded by mountains, palaces were along those mountains, buildings were not tall and able to see the new develop areas and old areas. Slight dissapointed - did not have places to sit and no much service facilities if compared with Lotte world tower (from namsan world tower you can see the Lotte world tower is right opposite to each other).

Once you are up there you can see the whole of Seoul (provided it's not a cloudy day). At the bottom of the tower you can write little messages and lock it by a designated fence there <3  My advise is to buy your own little lock before heading to Namsam tower because buying it there is quite expensive.

Would suggest them to have a shuttle bus specially dedicated for visitors even if it means charging, rather than having to take a public bus and to impose on their locals who merely want to take a bus from one point to another.

We managed to get a deal for two people, two drinks and a massive popcorn for virtually the same price as two standard tickets, which was a win. We loved going up in the lift to the top - no queue when we were there and the video was great.  We watched the sunset from the top so got the day / sunset / night view.

2202,theapp,4.0,"Ended up going for a morning jog up this hill to see the top. While I only recommend this if you are fit (the incline isn't forgiving), it was well worth the effort. The view from the top of this hill allows you to see most of Seoul. There are a few places to eat and if you're lucky, you'll even get to enjoy some live entertainment near the temple at the top. The tower is not too expensive and affords you a birds eye view of a massive city.  There are a few other things to see at the top of this hill, to include the lock bridge, where young couples proclaim their love for one another with padlocks hanging from the railings. And of course, there is the gondola lift that will take you to the top and back for a very reasonable rate. I'd recommend doing this at night, as it not only shows you the entire city, but adds a bit of ""ahh"" to the ride, since you are unable to see the tree line swooping past you.  Overall, this was a nice little tourist spot in Seoul and worth visiting. There are many methods to get to the top and if you have the time, it is worth exploring all the areas around the top, as you'll see some great sights.","Written September 27, 2017"

The cable car going up was packed as it departs every 10 minutes, so best to be one of the first inline so you can pick a corner to stand to enjoy the view going up. Once out of the cable car, there some steep and uneven steps before you get to some viewing platforms, with amazing views out across the city. We didn't bother going up into the tower it's self as there was some traditional performance going on so sat down to watch this instead.

The view was really obstructed by the bright lights within the viewing deck. Also seating was limited... which was odd. At least 50% of viewing deck is retail space which made things very crowded.

2218,Bibimyeo,5.0,"N Seoul Tower, aka Namsan, is one of the most popular attractions for visitors in Seoul. I've been there several times in the years I've lived in Korea. The best way I've found to get there, is to take the subway to Itaewon then grab a taxi to go up the hill. If you tell the taxi driver, Namsan Tower, they know where that is and may ask you top or bottom. Why? Because from the bottom, you can take a cable car ride to the almost-top and walk the rest of the way. The view from the cable car is pretty nice to see whether you go during the day or night, you get a birds-eye view of Seoul as far as your eyes can see. When you arrive at the almost-top, it's still a bit of a climb going up to the tower. My last visit, I went with my niece and nephew (10, 7 years old). They were fine walking up the stairs to the tower. At the Namsan Tower, you buy tickets for the Tower. There are different prices for additional attractions. When you get inside, you go through a souvenir photo background booth where photographers will take photos of you with a neutral screen background. If you're interested in the photos, you can purchase them upstairs. The digital photos can be mixed with different backgrounds of the Tower: in Spring with cherry blossoms, at night with the lights, during the day, etc. The observation deck at the top of Namsan Tower also has a photo booth where visitors can dress up in traditional Korean clothes- hanbok. It's a little pricey, but fun if you're into that kind of memorable souvenir. Going down: you can either take the cable car back down to where you started or walk down. My niece, nephew and I decided to walk down. That day, it started raining, drizzling, as we were walking. When we got to the bottom, we grabbed a taxi going to Insadong- our next stop.","Written September 16, 2017"

On a rainy day its more romantic as you can feel the mist around you. At the entrance there is a ticket counter , then go straight up to the top using an elevator. Just after getting out of the elevator all the guests are directed towards a gallery where they take pictures of all their guests ( dnt forget to giv ur best pose )and later if u want a copy , u can buy it from the top floor. At the top floor one can view the city by using the special telescopes. There are so many pretty souvenir shops . there are many options for coffee and snacks up there.

Expect lots of tourists and couples crowding this area during weekends and evenings. That said, it is a pretty dang decent view if you can peek out from over the crowds and love-lock infested railings. I would certainly recommend to hike up the mountain and arrive just before sunset. You will be tired enough to want to lounge around until the dusk, which gives you the benefit of seeing the city in the daylight, the colors of the sunset, and the lights after dark.

We went to the top of the tower but you could see that a lot of people don't as the view at the base is pretty good.

We took the cable car up. They PACK the people in so if you dont rush to a side of the cart you basically cant see anything. The cart ride isnt great so if i was to do it again i would just get the bus up.  Once you get to the base of the tower its then more money to get up. I understand they need to pay for everything but it really does feel like a tourist trap.

2273,Julia W,4.0,"The N Seoul Tower, although boasting stunning views of Seoul city, is the typical tourist attraction. I've been to many similar towers around the world, and they are all very similar to each other, with just different views. If you have not been in a tower like this, I would recommend it, however it is nothing special. It contains the usual features to try and coerce you into spending your money such as the group photos, gift shops and overpriced restaurants. The views are amazing though and I would recommend a visit if it is your first time. There is one special feature which are the locks on the fences, which are quite fun to do and look nice. The hike is also quite beautiful and great if you want to enjoy nature and fresh air. The cable car ride is also stunning and you can see amazing views. I would recommend going to the tower during the day time, where the view is clearer, whereas as night only the lights can be seen. I did go during sunset and the ride up the cable car was beautiful, and the views were absolutely amazing. This is dependent on the season, I went in winter, it was quite cold at night, and the bus rides down the mountain were limited. There are a few restaurants there, however I would not recommend them based on my personal experience. I went to the Korean buffet, and the food was not worth the price. The view was nice, however the food was below my expectations, and it was quite pricey as well. Overall I enjoyed my visit to the N Seoul Tower, however I think that one visit is enough.","Written August 9, 2017"
2274,Shafiqullah,4.0,"Seoul Tower in South Korea (Namsan Tower)  Seoul Tower, also called Namsan Tower or, more recently, N Seoul Tower, is located in the centre of Seoul on Mount Namsan. Seoul Tower was opened to the public for the first time on the 15th of October 1980. Namsan Tower is 236.7 metres high and, because it stands on Namsan Seoul Towertop of Mount Namsan, it rises to about 480 metres above sea level, thus allowing visitors to enjoy a great panoramic view of Seoul.  Seoul Tower was remodelled in 2005 and it opened to the public again on the 9th of December 2005, with the name of N Seoul Tower (N stands for new). The new tower has a new lighting system that makes the tower spectacular at night; new facilities such as restaurants, shops, caf√©s; a lobby with a media zone where films and music videos are shown for free; two pavilions, one for exhibitions and the other for performances; two observatories, the new digital observatory with new state of the art digital telescopes and the classic analogue observatory; a new revolving western style restaurant called N Grill on the top floor.","Written August 9, 2017"

It is definitely a great destination to take pictures and just look over Seoul and as well as that, the railings of stairs are chained with beautiful colourful locks that you can purchase (quite expensive though). If you want to purchase a lock and key, I suggest going to the actual store to buy the locks rather than people standing around on the platforms. Other than that, it was definitely worth the experience. As well as that, inside there are restaurants, souvenirs, walls where you can write stuff on, and an arcade which I enjoyed greatly.

It is famous for being the 'go to' place with your partner to place a lock on the available fixtures, thereby 'locking' your love for each other.  My partner and I decided to make a trip up on a weekday night. From our hotel in Myeongdong, we walked to the cable car station and boarded the cable car that took us to Namsan Tower. At times, the cable car can be pretty filled up as the ushers try to pack in as many visitors as possible at once. That said, the short journey makes it bearable. The area was not very crowded while we were there and hence, we could really enjoy what the place had to offer. The atmosphere was great and the air was cold and crisp. We ended up taking a leisurely night stroll around the area, browsing in the gift shops, immersing ourselves in the beautiful scenery and of course, doing the love lock thingy!  Overall, a very great first experience at Namsan Tower and I would recommend that those who have not been there before to visit at least once just for the experience.

It was earlier in the morning so no line at all. The cable car ride only took about 10 minutes. You're in between trees so the view is just ok. I would have preferred to walk up and recommend it for anyone who is capable and willing.  Walking around underneath the tower, there were some areas with ok views. Unfortunately it was a little smoggy that day so you can't see very clearly for long. We got a couple ice cream cones and sat in the back with tables and panoramic glass window looking towards Gangnam. Unfortunately the would be relaxing experience was many times ruined by people dragging chairs across the concrete that creates the most horrific high pitched sound.  Given the less than ideal visibility, we didn't pay additional to go up to the top of the tower.

There was a show on during our visit which my husband enjoyed but I found it deafening. There are other viewing towers in Seoul for example the Lotte Tower which is newer and higher but it is more expensive. We didn't go up the Lotte Tower because we had already gone up the N S Tower. My advice would be to choose one tower as to do them all is pricey for a similar view. If there are an Elvis Presley fans reading, There is a small free museum that might be worth 10 minutes of your time. It is run by a husband and wife who are obvious fans. It is at the beginning of the hill on your left going up. Nice Pasta and Pizza, coffee shop on the opposite side of the street. Sorry can't remember the name.

I thought the Observatory Deck was pretty much the only attraction but I was really surprised to see that there is actually quite a bit to see and do there with a lot of shops on each floor. So I recommend you allow for about 2 hours of time there. Getting there is very easy, cable car or a bus. If by bus, take the number 2 bus from Chungmuro Station (outside the cinema) and it takes about 20 minutes to the Tower stop.

We didn't go up the tower as it was an additional cost and the day we went was foggy hindering good views. We felt it wouldn't add many city views as the free areas had fabulous cityscape views.

Some towers stand out due to architecture, some due to the elevators, some due to the educational value, some due to props inside...  Unfortunately, this tower didn't stand out for any positive attributes. It wasn't very educational or special in any way.  *Health warning!*: If you have photosensitive epilepsy, DO NOT go to this attraction! There are no warning signs nor does anyone try warn you of anything out of norm.  I don't have this condition, but I got really dizzy in the elevator. They turn on really loud thumping music with flashing lights of a fake night sky. I want to say there were mirrors all around to make the elevator feel bigger and it intensified the experience. It felt like a rave party in there and you're trapped until the elevator opens. Due to the discomfort, the ride for me probably felt longer than it really was.  In my opinion, the special effects were totally unwarranted. I rather they spend the money into giving some scientific information about the tower and landscape at the top.","Written June 8, 2017"

That way you get to see Seoul in the daylight and also at night. the view at night is really spectacular. bring a jacket with you. if the wind is strong, you will get cool pretty quick . as it happened to us in May 2017. unfortunately during our visit, the tower was restricted. but the views from the lower floors was just as great. we went there by the municipal bus, which was cheap and easy. we caught the bus near a Myeong Dong metro station and it only took 20 mins and cost us KRW 1,200. The bus will bring you all the way up to the tower. but when you are ready to go home , do get to the bus stop when there is no queue. because if there is a long queue , you might end up standing in the bus due to the large number of passengers also going home. i don't advise walking - its a really long and hard climb from the bottom of the hill to Namsan tower. there are a number of restaurants up there , we ended up eating burgers with a fantastic view of Seoul city. but if you are on a budget, there is a convenience store near the Namsan bus stop , which sells instant noodle pots and some snacks.","Written June 6, 2017"

The queue for the cable car can be quite long, especially before sunset. Allow plenty of time for this.  Once at the top you will need to pay a fee for the tower itself. There are many of locations around the top where you can take some great shots of the city, but inside the tower itself, is where you really see Seoul for its beauty.  Buildings with a backdrop of mountains and cars which look like ants! Lots of useful information pointing to different cities around the world.  You really want to be up here when the sun is just about to go down. The views and colours are amazing so a camera is a must.

I would recommend going during cherry blossom season because the road is covered in the petals and it's constantly raining down with petals from the trees, especially when cars and buses come past.

2461,USA to ROK,5.0,So the day that we went a family of 5 the two parents of five-year-old and two teenagers we took a taxi up to the cable car I recommend that as the best way to get to the N Tower. The cable car ride to the tower was jam-packed full so it's very hard to get your window to get good video so you might have to head your way strongly to get to the window to get some good video or pictures. The wait to get on the cable car was not very long so that was very well worth it. I think you can also walk up the hill and take all the steps to get to the in Tower which I would love to do on a nice spring or fall day not a rainy day like we went. Make sure you take a lot of padlock or some kind of lock to add to the locks at the top I forget what they're for but it's really a pretty cool it's a community or World Wide Arts peace you'll understand when you get there but take a log or Google it before you get there to know why you're taking a lot. There are several places to eat at the in Tower all ranges of prices ranging from probably 2 or 3 Bill signs 2425 Bill signs though so nothing really cheap but definitely a place to stop and eat if you want to have time it was crazy busy even on a rainy day. Once you're up in the tower they have names major cities like New York City is so many kilometers away excetera excetera which is pretty cool so you couldn't go all the way around the whole circle and take pictures with you or yourself and your family and with the cities that you've been to or the city that you're from. The little to shop up in the tower was wonderful and we thought the prices were very fair for some very unique gift ideas we opted for the little puzzle with the frame which happened to be on sale and they had multiple items on there like weekly or monthly cell so that was really. The candy store if it's still there was pretty cool also apart everything is impeccably clean and the candy is quite good although a little spendy but it's worth it. I would say if your only choice to go was during rainy weather then it absolutely still is a must go on but if you could go during clearweather then that would be the best although I'm sure that's also the busiest.,"Written May 1, 2017"

If you are super fit you can walk up to the N Seoul Tower, otherwise the walk up is not for the faint hearted. When we arrived at the ticket box there was an ambulance collecting someone that had collapsed from the walk. Once you get up to the tower there is a lot to do- shops, eateries, children's activities, marital arts demonstrations and much more. We stayed here for about 3 hours and then walked down. It was about 20 minutes walk down, but you felt sorry for the people walking up, as it is a long walk. This is a must see when in Seoul.","Written April 27, 2017"

2484,Zainab K,4.0,"As a tourist my friend and I were told we had to go here and I'm glad we did! The tower offers a variety of attractions and although we never made it inside it just shows how much there is to do. We got to the tower by taking the subway to Seoul station and left through exit 9. We then walked a short distance forward and the shuttle bus stand was there where we took a shuttle bus straight to the park. Other ways include the subway to Myeongdong and a cable car. You can't take a taxi or a car there as they are trying to reduce the pollution to protect the area.  Once at the location you walk up a HILL to get to the actual tower. Wear good shoes guys! There is lots to do there before even paying to get in the tower (which happened to us because of time constraints). There were different dances and sword fighting displays with a running commentary of South Koreas historical background. This is offered in both Korean and English. They include the audience quite a lot which is great fun! I found myself laughing at the comedic side of it!  There is lots to eat ranging from lunch to dessert and snacks so you won't go hungry.  The iconic love locks are also there. For 8000 won you can buy one or 12000 won you can buy a set of two locks, both come with a free marker pen. You then go to write whatever you want and lock it up on the tower forever! Its an amazing thing to do as it feels like you're leaving a part of yourself in Seoul.  This was all done without paying an entrance fee to get into the tower. Unfortunately we never made it inside due to time constraints but that shows there's a lot of fun stuff to do! Definitely visit there, just give yourself a good amount of time.","Written April 24, 2017"

Be sure to only go up on a clear day as a good view is key to enjoying this elevation. Another option is to walk along the paths around Namsan which is pretty flat and full of nature.

At -15C, we walked uphill, and when arrived at the cable car's ticket I was sweating and took off my jacket -- it was quite an uphill walk!!! But of course you have the option to take the cab, and on other side there's an elevator from down the road going to cable car tickets.  The cable car ride has nice views esp during the time of our visit -- winter and snowing. I think thats my favorite part.  There's another charge to go to the observatory deck which we chose not to because you can already enjoy the view after the cable car.  I rate it average because it's just like a mall or some kind of commercial area at the top of the mountain. It's not like you're going ski down. That ""hike"" we did was not compensated with what I saw. Again, just personal opinion.  I also dont think this is a good place to visit when you have (even a bit of) walking issues.  Average because it's not a place I'd return to even without that uphill walk.","Written April 9, 2017"

It was pretty romantic to watch the sun go down and see the city light up though.  We had to take a subway, then a taxi and then a cable car to take us to the tower. Overall it cost the two of us around 27000W, only to find out that we would have to pay another 10000W EACH just to go up the bloody thing. Unnecessary extra cost in our opinion as the view from its base was pleasant enough, especially from the cable car. Generally, a nice thing to do in the evening but don't expect to be blown away.","Written April 2, 2017"

The way up was nice and I got a lot of cool videos and pictures.  We didn't have time to explore the ground floor of the tower (I did see a hello kitty store tho) but Im pretty sure there were a couple of restaurants or cafes down there. We quickly discovered that you also had to pay to actually go up in the tower which was annoying (since we had already payed for the cable car) but it didn't cost that much. We also had to wait in line to get to the elevator, maybe 15 minutes or so. The view is very pretty once you actually get up. You can see the whole city!! Everybody was taking pictures but the windows till didn't get too crowded. There was a candy store and a souvenir shop on the inner side, I didn't buy anything but there was a wide range of different goods. Overall the trip was fun. I've been to Burj Khalifa so it wasn't that mind-blowing for me but you got a cool view :) We decided to walk down but you can obviously also take the cable car.

You can catch some local buses to the top of the tower, green buses 2, 3 and 5. The bus routes are in English and Korean at the bus stops, super cheap!! 1200won I think. Much cheaper than the cable car and, if you're lazy like me, easier than walking!!  When we arrived there was a traditional military performance, swords, pikes and other such things. Highly entertaining! Not sure if it is a common occurrence or I was lucky because it was the lunar new year. But there was also a chance to try on the traditional dresses for free! These experiences really made the trip to the tower special.  There are a lot of whimsical romantic things to do. Me and my boyfriend are not really interested in the love locks (they are very expensive and they get taken off after a short while to make room for more) so the whole thing stank like a money grab, guilt trip hoax. But that's just us =P many people there seemed to enjoy the ""romantic"" stuff. Different strokes I guess.  Try and go on a clear day, the sunset is very nice. Windows are dirty though!!!

The tower is situated on top of Mt. Namsan (hence the name), so you can have a better view of the city (which, for me is best at night). Couples should not miss this attraction and the chance to hang your love locks in the thousands of love locks in the tower railings. Don't worry if you forgot your pens and padlocks, these are available at the convenience store at the Namsan Cable Car station and at the N Seoul Tower.

Decent prices. Modern and unique gifts. Not the same stuff as on the streets of Seoul. I suggest buying the small puzzle and frame. 2. Locks. Bring a lock. Put your name wish or prayer on it and lock it to the fence or one of many places. I've never seen this before. I can't explain it. Just bring one. 3. Restaurants. They were a bit pricey but lots of options. 4. Elevator. Cool video shown on ceiling of elevator with video going up or down. Reminded me of Willy Wonka with Depp. 5. Cable car going up and down. Cool but packed. 6. I think you can actually will or hike up to the tower. That would be very cool to do in the future.  Lastly. We went with 4 year old up to 16 year olds.

Besides the phenomenal number of love locks, the place can be quite disappointing if you have been to a couple of towers in famous cities. Compared to the Sydney Eye and Shanghai Oriental Pearl TV Tower, the view of the city is that fantastic.  You can buy the ticket to the Tower at a discounted price if you buy it together with a ticket to the Hello Kitty mini museum.

I am definitely not a hiker so I grumbled and puffed all the way up to where the Tower was located (you can catch a bus if you're like me and you dislike hiking or you can go by cable car as well). Even though I disliked hiking and climbing stairs, I have to admit the view was to die for at every stop you make. Venturing into the Tower itself was an experience of its own. My favorite part of the trip up to the Tower was leaving behind a piece of memory in the beautifully designed memory trees (you can buy locks to write on where you can stick to a tree or you can just enjoy reading other people's memory locks). It's a must visit, the walk down from the Tower was magical in the night time (during winter as well). Will definitely visit the Tower again soon.","Written December 9, 2016"

Loved how there were 2 gym areas to do you workouts, lovely clean areas everywhere - this is how ALL of Korea is CLEAN AND TIDY. Whilst walking we past a lovely small lake which has heaps of 'gold' fish in it - however the lake was frozen - rather funny as we tried to drop stones on it to confirm it was frozen"" ‚ùÑÔ∏èas it was -6"" and we were loving it. There was also a lovely kids playground and some interesting signs around the park. Then came the huge steep hills, they have steps or ramps to get up them, which I had to do the ramp. (Definitely need shoes with a good grip). Once we finally got to the top we found out that there was a bus that could take you to the top. I'd recommend this if you couldn't do the walk as it's definitely something that you should see. From the top we found this incredible view 360"" of Seoul. We had a lovely cheap lunch - pizza & drink - I was there with my brother & the restaurant took us to an area which was for couples - love seat with an amazing view. Would've been great if I was with my husband, so we got up & went to another area which was heaps cheaper & perfect for what we needed. When heading into the tower be ready to gave your photo taken & to make a pose. Unfortunately we didn't do it in time so we got a crappie photo. There are shops underneath the tower however most of them went finished being built, only a couple open, so not really worth going into until they're finished. Enjoy the return walk as it's mostly down hill, we actually went thru a dirt track coming back and it went straight down the side of the mountain - extremely quickly considering it took as about 45 minutes to get to the top and about 20mins to go back down. If taking the short cut be very careful but definitely worth it.","Written December 8, 2016"

Pen down my wishes on the lock in permanent marker prior the trip and brought it over to N Seoul tower.  We then took the lift up to N Seoul tower, a little ear block due to the pressure, but it was fine.  there is souvenir shop on top of the N Seoul tower and my friend bought a nanoblock version of the N Seoul tower, i guess it was an exclusive item as i did not see it elsewhere in seoul.  i did a touristy thing by buying a postcard and stamp to mail back home to Singapore (: the price of the postcard varies, depending on the design you choose, and the stamp is about 100won? (it is such a small amount, so i cant rem accurately). There is a red mail box just next to it, so after writing my postcard, i just drop it inside.  i posted on 1st november 2016 and received it back in Singapore on 23rd november 2016. it was kinda fun to see the postcard again, brought back nice memories of the place.  before we head down, we went to the washroom (we are still at the top of N Seoul Tower) and boy, we had a surprise! we could view the scenery from the cubicle inside! and it felt like i was given my own private piece of serenity paradise while being inside the cubicle. so i cant help by taking scenery photo inside the cubicle (after i finished my business of course) (:  we went down and visited two exhibitions. according to my friends, the exhibitions might vary from time to time, so during our visit on 1st november 2016, so one is about Hello Kitty & another one contained Marvel superheroes & Disney related characters. we spent about 1-2 hours at the exhibitions (not inclusive of the duration up in the tower), there are also little merchanise corners as well.  it was worthwhile spending the time there (:  i really enjoyed myself at N Seoul Tower, especially with the autumn leaves changing colours, they add vibrant colours to the pictures.","Written November 28, 2016"

We were a group of 7 people and not all of us are physically fit for a hike, especially during winter. After some deliberation, we ended up buying a one way ticket up and decided to walk down going back. It was a great decision. The walk back offers a nice lovely stroll even if its relatively short in distance. I would recommend walking down instead of hiking up. I see a lot of people doing it the other way around and see them panting like crazy. Take the cable car to ascend to the base of the tower instead. Note though that even if it says it is open till 11pm (some sites even say midnight), the cable car operates until 1030 pm only. We went during winter and the place was freezing but its still a nice little spot above the seoul skyline. Also, you gotta join the lovelock bandwagon. The locks cost around 6000 to 10000 won without the permanent marker. That costs another 1000 won. :) I would say that witer time and night time would be best for lovers.

After they locked the lock in there, they believed they like the lover‚Äôs lock will lock together and will love each other forever. This is a romantic place and full of couple love in there. It makes us want to take a picture and also want a boyfriend. Moreover, we can go the top of the tower. We can view the whole Seoul in there. But we didn‚Äôt stay until at night. It is to be regretted that we miss the night scene. I guess it must be great. Besides, there are also some restaurant and caf√© shop let people take a rest. Next time, I want to go to there again.","Written November 22, 2016"

On the tower there were crowded with many people, they were likely to lock the locks over here. I took lots of photos with my two best friends, due to the season of tourism, we had to queue in order to take the photos in some views that we always saw in Korean drama.

There are three main parts, which are Seoul tower, bear meseum and lock bridge. No matter you go in the morning or at night. The view is really nice. At that time I went at night, so I don't have chance to show how it looks like in the morning. Every time when I go there, there are a lot of people, such as tourists, visitors and even local residents. You can choose take bus and walk to the tower, or take the cable car. I like walking up to the hill because you can see different sides of view of Seoul. But just for reminded, it is kinda hard to walk the slope. This time I took the cable car to leave Seoul tower, it's amazing. Because you can see the other side of Seoul. You can see in the picture. The view is really nice. But the picture couldn't show it clearly. I didn't have time to visit the bear museum. But I walked around outside. There is a souvenir shop that you can buy the model of Seoul tower.

It's easy to get there but if you want to catch the free shuttle from myeongdong station to where the cable cars are better check the time schedule of the shuttle before hand. My friend and I missed it so we took a cab and paid 3,000 won for the ride. Actually it's pretty close because my friend and I just walked back when we went home but those are your options. The waiting line can get pretty long for the cable car ride but it moves fast. It can get pretty windy and cold once you get on the tower area cause it's high up so I'd suggest bringing a jacket even if you're there during summer or spring. The night time view is really pretty!

2862,lsli88,2.0,"Perhaps it was my poor experience at the buffet restaurant (HanCook), the long wait at the Namsan cable car station, or getting ripped off by taxi drivers at the Namsan cable car station taxi stop - that led me to such a poor rating.  N Seoul Tower is one of your typical observation towers among its brethren - e.g. Space Needle, CN Tower, Calgary Tower, etc. And like these other observation towers, they do provide nice views of the city (probably the best time to arrive to these towers is a little before sunset) at a steep cost.  My first annoyance was the shuttle that they provide from Myeondong (line 1) is very confusing. I waited at the stop and the Namsan Cable Car station shuttle came by. My original intention was to take the bus directly to the tower as it was cheaper than the cable car and I heard not so positive reviews of the cable car. The bus driver, who was clearly English deficient or purposely deceitful, told me I was in the correct bus - then promptly dropped me off at the cable car station. I have to imagine that this is a scam, as you then have no other alternative to get to the tower other than using the cable car. The cable car cost is approximately $7.50 USD vs app. $2 USD for the bus ride. So I relented to buy tickets, only to have to wait around 30-45 minutes for a chance to ride the cable car up (be aware of the Disney-like lines which hide the true wait time).  The cable car itself was standing room only. The views going up were a bit disappointing and IMHO not worth the extra $5.50 USD. You can see a nice view of Myeongdong, but you don't get that super wide panoramic view of the other parts of Seoul. The ride is short as well - app. 3 minutes!  I arrived a little after sunset, so that may have tempered my opinion of the place as the views were much more limited at that time. You do have views of various areas of Seoul, as well as an area where people chained these love locks to a fence (similar to a bridge in Seattle), various restaurants, souvenir shops, etc. I didn't realize the Alive Museum is there (I went to the one in Jeju and wasn't too impressed).  We decided to purchase dinner for HanCook restaurant, the buffet restaurant at the tower for approximately $88 USD for two. The only nice thing about this is that the price includes a trip to the top of the tower. I have a separate review of the restaurant, but I can easily summarize the restaurant as terrible. I was able to walk around the tower after dinner - there isn't too much unique to see in the tower itself. We then took a walk around the area at the base of the tower - and again, there isn't much unique to see in terms of shops or restaurant.  We took the cable car back down - the wait was much less. The trip down was uneventful. However, I arrived back at the cable car station base a little after 8:30 PM and unfortunately, the last bus to Myeongdong departs at 8:30 PM! Obviously, the cable car station ticket office doesn't warn you about this. Accordingly, you are left to the wolves - in this case, the taxi drivers. I didn't want to walk back to Myeongdong so I approached a taxi driver for a ride back to Myeongdong. The taxi driver immediately indicated it would cost me a 20000 won rate up front, $17 USD for essentially driving less than a few miles (and actually, Myeongdong is literally only a mile or two away from the Namsan cable car station)! I should have called an UberBlack car at that time instead of taking the taxi... But the lesson is - beware of the Seoul taxi drivers!  Anyway, N Seoul Tower should probably low on your priority list of Seoul attractions as there are many other worthwhile attractions to go to.","Written November 16, 2016"

If you're there till late, the tower will be lighted up and you can also get a lovely night time view of the city!

You go up the observatory tower for a fee or you can choose to buy a dining package with the restaurant there which includes free access up the observation tower. The night views from the tower is awesome so I was told. I think so too. Myeongdong is also nearby and can be reached in under 15 minutes on foot.

There was an element of fun mixed in to the back drop of the great views of the city plus the trees and nature that is the Namsan Park.  I didn't go up to the observation deck itself. I chose to stick to the viewing platforms around the tower which provided multi level views of different sides of the city.  One of the striking elements would be the love locks that are pretty much every where. A lot of couples come up here and the sheer number of locks is a testament to that. Whilst I came here during the day time you can imagine during sunset and the evening that this would be site for many couples seeking a romantic respite from the city below.  Around the tower itself, aside from the park, are restaurants and cafes that give you the opportunity to just relax and enjoy the environment. For families aside from letting the kids run around for a bit there are fun characters to take photos with.  Whilst I wouldn't necessarily say it's a must see I'd suggest choosing a time of day that meets the objectives of your visit whether it be as a group, family, couple or Individual and just enjoy chill out and enjoy yourself.  Note: I took the cable car up and a bus down.

Before heading to elevator, you'll have a quick picture taking and one reached the top, your picture is done with few different backgrounds of Seoul tower for a fee. Exiting tower, there's a restaurant down below the stairs and you'll find 3D show from ceiling and huge TV wall. Nice!! It's nice to be in nature park but the tourist can be overwhelming. Just wish they can limit the number of people to enter the tower and park.","Written November 5, 2016"
2901,janet l,4.0,"We took the Seoul city bus (hop on hop off bus) and it brought us to all the main attraction sites. This particular stop dropped us off at the foot of the mountain. We took the trail up to the tower. It was actually steeper than I thought. I was a bit afraid that my 2y/o son might roll down the trail. Took us less than 10 minutes to get up to the foot of the tower. There is a few restaurants,a square that has entertainment and lots of love locks.  Tip: there are 2 trails 1 is the main steep trail that everyone takes (on the right). On the left it's more like the ""back"" trail it is less steep and it leads you to an elevator (wheelchair accessible) you can also take the stairs up. We took the stairs down. There was practically no one so we are able to take some great pictures. There's also a Hanbok store that you can rent at a hefty price.","Written November 4, 2016"

2904,Dickson90,4.0,"For a first time visit to Seoul, it would be good to consider the N Seoul Tower as one of your destinations. Of course, there are other similar places such as 63 Building for instance, but N Seoul Tower would be the easiest for a first time visitor.  To get up to N Seoul Tower, you would have to get to the Namsan Cable Car first. The cable car itself is about 15 minutes walk from Myeongdong Station. The cable car will get you up to the top of Namsan Park in about less than 5 minutes. However, be prepared for a wait of about 30 minutes at least during peak hours. Of course, there is the walking option from the bottom if you do not wish to wait that long.  If you wish to take a good shot at sunset or at night, I would say that it is actually better to take it from Namsan Park right outside the N Seoul Tower, rather than at N Seoul Tower itself. As we went during sunset time, it was quite crowded even outside N Seoul Tower itself, but the views are quite amazing even then. I would advise coming early to get a good view.  We went up to N Seoul Tower and found that the views are great, but there is not really too much difference from the views outside N Seoul Tower though. Because of the glass panels at the observation deck, it can be a little difficult to take photos without having reflection in it. It is better to go during the daytime if you wish to go up to the N Seoul Tower in my opinion.  There are a few restaurants serving those who are hungry for a reasonable price, along with a good view of the Seoul skyline as well. Overall, I would say N Seoul Tower would be good to visit once, but there are probably other better places to view the Seoul skyline, perhaps even for free too without the crowds.","Written November 3, 2016"

But nevertheless, when you are on top of the tower and you can see Seoul from above, all your worries are forgotten. The windows were a bit dirty though, so the view wasn't the best.

2919,Fabius M,1.0,"We are residents in Seoul since 4 years and we went every year more as twice up to the tower. It was a nice green place within a busy town. I remember 3 years ago it was a relaxing walk up and down and also the tower area was quite peaceful. Somehow I have the feeling it is worsening year by year. The operator has started to renovate and offer now several floors with shops, restaurants and whatsoever. Some of them opened and just closed again. LOL. Why? Because probably not many people will spend a penny there. There are mainly interested in making selfies. That's it. And who shall buy all these things you really don't need? We went there and left every time at least 50k for tower entrance and a beer, coffee or ice cream. There were a few shops totally enough to serve visitors. And usually you climb up to have a nice few and not to drink and eat whole day long. Anyway this time is over for us spending any coin there. This year every time we visited the place it was totally over crowded. If you want to visit tower's upper floor you shall wait at least an hour or even more. Especially on the weekends. Same way down. I can be wrong but since 2015 it changed dramatically. We usually walking either up or down along the small road. I remember the time when we saw many people using the bike to go up. Time is over. Now every minute some old diesel engine is rushing uphill to unload and to come back to collect again. Some of them are driving fast and reckless. If you have kids you are mainly busy with watching them because you are afraid that something happened. I really wonder why Seoul citizens are not doing much about it. Did they gave up already? Do they like how it is? This place becomes really disgusting. It has nothing to do anymore with a nice, beautiful, quiet, green, park and place. It just became a polluted place of commerce. We will not visit again. We are done with this tower. Have fun.","Written October 31, 2016"

2922,Shane S,2.0,"Sure, there is a great view of the city from Seoul Tower, but be aware of what it will require to see it. I strongly recommend NOT going on a Friday or Saturday night. I was here before, and it was just a long wait. This Saturday night, it was a hideous wait.... around 1.5+ hours to get up the cable car, then another one hour (minimal) to go up in the tower. The cable car is around $10/each, the tower is more than $20/each. At the tower, you will be bombarded by over priced/under quality food selections, like N Burger, the worst burger in my life.... I hear there is a bus you can take to the tower, maybe that would be better.. Taxi's cannot take you there or back from there, so that's a real bummer. I would not do this again unless I had some assurance of a shorter wait. In total, took us over 3 hours to get to the top of the tower, maybe a bit more, not worth it!!!!","Written October 30, 2016"

The elevator takes you to the top and you can spend as much time as you like taking in the view of a very, very crowded city of skyscrapers. It is hard to believe the amount of people (10 million) who live in the city until you see the vast spread of high rise living. Next, go down a level, that I think is actually better than the top level. Go down to the bottom and spend time looking at all the love locks.....they are EVERYWHERE.

It's a fairly steep trek up. Once off the tram at the next viewing area love locks were placed everywhere, so if that something you would like to do you may want purchase it before getting there or pay 8000 won. As you proceed it does get a bit commercial and you can pay to go up to the observation deck.

The locks were Low quality type and with many colors. It also helps to decorate the fencing, and adds lots of colors into the surroundings.

Starting at the bus stop, it wasn't clear how to get to and enter the tower grounds. Then it was obvious where to buy tickets for the observation deck. Ticket buying came with a bunch of weird options for combos like observation deck/beer/popcorn, etc. We just got tickets for the observation deck. Then it was a mystery where to go to catch the elevator to the observation deck. There was a system with a monitor to tell you when you could go up. Only one elevator was being used so the line was slow. When we got up it was a glassed in gift shop with fantastic views of the city at night time. The line to go back down was VERY long and wrapped on itself and was not well defined. Thank goodness Koreans are excellent at queuing up and behaving in general. When we got back down, we ate at some restaurants that were oddly laid out and extremely slow.

Beware on return there were some cab drivers who demanded 20000 won because these are the waiting cabs. Don't give in, just wait for those that drop off passengers to this spot. It is a bit much to walk up in the dark narrow road. So take the cable car. Be sure to stand at the windows of the cable car to see the view going or coming down. You have to pay a separate entrance fee to go up the Seoul Tower. The sight up there is just ok, but I guess as a one time visitor you ought to try. The souvenir shop at the top and the lighting inside distract the view towards outside at night. While there, do not miss the locks of love at the foot of the tower.

2982,peterh125,4.0,As with all my reviews to sights in Seoul I will preface this by advising visitors to carefully check opening days and times and whether timed entry tickets are needed to access certain parts of the attraction and also the times for booking guided tours in their language of preference ‚Äì bearing in mind that numbers can be limited  I was in Seoul for nearly 3 weeks and had only 2 days when skies could be declared relatively clear. A combination of poor weather and pollution means visibility can be poor and that would not be good for a visit to the Tower. Luckily the day I chose views were quite good  It is possible to walk all the way from Seoul to the base of the Tower. But it's a long steep uphill trek and most people go by bus or take the cable car. Even to/from the cable car station there is a challenging flight of stairs  The attraction is popular and busy. Entrance tickets are timed to avoid overcrowding and it is possible to reserve tables at the various restaurants at the summit where expensive set price menus are offered.  The observation decks are well thought out with each window containing a description of the direction you are looking. Gentlemen must check out the lavatories on the observation level - the views are great!!  Visitor amenities are excellent.

Typically, the Namsan Cable Car is recommended as a means to go to the tower; however, personally, I'd rather save money and take a tourist bus. This is because they cram too many passengers in a cable car that there's not enough room to actually appreciate the sights. Though the bus takes longer, it does give you a scenic tour around the city.  There are other attractions aside from the observatory deck so while waiting for sunset or evening to arrive; you can use the time to explore the other facilities. A feature that really won me over would be the country viewpoints that it had; wherein a window is labeled with names of countries and their respective distances from the tower.

Once we got to the tower, it was a nice area with a lot going on. The views were amazing from the top, but it wasn't the best night for views being a bit cloudy and it was getting dark at this point. We ended up having dinner at the Korean buffet restaurant in the tower, which is below the observatory floor. We wanted to have dinner above the observatory floor, but you need reservations for that Italian restaurant which we did not have. Being in Seoul, we wanted Korean food so it worked out. It cost us 50,000 won each for dinner, which included getting us up in the tower as well. Our dinner ticket also got us to the front of the line. We ended up walking down even though we had bought tickets for the cable car because the line was so long and we just couldn't wait in another line. It wasn't so bad walking down but our feet were already hurting. The views on the way down were very nice, however, and we ended up just walking to our hotel, the Lotte Hotel Seoul.

Many recommended us that it is not the proper time to visit as we would not be able to see the panoramic view due to fog. But we were lucky that for few seconds the fog went away and we could take the glimpse of the beautiful view of the entire Seoul. We were very happy when the fog got cleared. When we get down from the cable car there were colourful locks everywhere which was called as ""lock of love"" . I think those people whose wishes were fullfilled had tied them. But it was a very colourful view, everywhere colourful locks. we we went the top most point of the tower, there was a post office, which was the highest post office of Seoul and there in a shop postcards were being sold.

3042,Zfy Ed,4.0,"Well, we have visited many Sky Towers in different cities in our walk around the world and every time when we come across a new one, we would not hesitate to visit it because the view on the city will be different and will gain unique and wonderful experience.  So in our recent Seoul trip, we decided to visit the N Seoul Tower. It was about past 4.00pm when we arrived and the place was still crowded with visitors mostly foreigners. The viewing point on the ground floor was already awesome and it was built on top on the hill. Along the way, we saw trees with ""LOVE LOCKS"" besides the the mental railings that also have such locks too! It was so colourful and impressive! Unlike the love lock bridges in European cities, mostly located above a river where one would throw the keys into the river after locking it, right here, there is no river but one can throw the keys down the hill! Haha. (you can actually buy a lock in the souvenir shop)  Upon entering the tower via the main entrance, we immediately saw a souvenir and gift shop with a lovely Hello Kitty display at its entrance and no one could withstand the temptation for not taking a photo with it.  Our fullday city tour guide had gone to the ticketing booth to get us the ticket to the top while we were busy taking photos with the Hello Kitty!  Then we took the elevator to the top (according to our guide, the tower was about 250m tall, about 80 storeys if I didn't remember wrongly). While most elevators in other Towers are standard and quite ""boring"" while moving upwards, the ceiling of the elevator here has astonishing moving animations (that depicted moving into the space galaxy) and it was indeed impressive. So everyone in the elevator were kept occupied and so focused on it and forgot the ""time spent"" in getting up there. (anyway, it was quite fast too, think less than a minute)  When we arrived at the top, wow! The view here was spectacular! We walked around 360 degree and really have had a great bird eye's view on Seoul, could see the Gangnam area (South of the Han River), Myeongdong etc. As the sky was still bright, the view was cleared! We really enjoyed the view so much!  There is also a souvenir and gift store right well where you could grab some candies, t-shirts, postcards etc here. Though the place is touristy but they had some promotions and so the items we grabbed here were still reasonable in price.  After our visit here, we took the elevator down to the 1st storey where we had to walk through a ""tunnel"" with LED TVs on both sides featuring Seoul in different times and development phases via computer graphics and animations (on the other side, they also have TV screens that show the history of the country as one walks around). It was very interesting and fascinating and no doubt why Korea is so advance in IT and technology!  Well, if you like heights and good city view from the top of the world, this place will be relevant and good for you. As mentioned earlier, each sky tower is different and offer different and unique views on the city and so it's unfair to compare with one to another. Visit with an open mind and with the feeling to see and experience new and different things, your visit here will be fun, interesting and wonderful!","Written September 13, 2016"

There are lots of fun and affordable souvenirs available at the gift shop there, too. We would recommend arriving at the tour around 5pm to be able to see the view of the city transition from day to night. It was really exciting to see the lights of the city come on as daylight fell.

The views are not always clear because of the haze but stil worth the visit. We went up during the day however some recommend a night visit to see the city lights.  If you visit during the day you may consider walking up the hill instead of taking the cable car. It is a peaceful walk and mostly shaded but you will need a moderate level of fitness. I suggest an 8:30am start and the 1.5 hour hike will get you to the tower at opening time at 10am.

On the way down, there was also a huge line up so we opted to forfeit our purchased tickets and walked down. At first, I was very hesitant as it was late out and I wasn‚Äôt sure how lit the paths were. Well, this has got to be the best laid out hiking path ever.

In fact, there were still tons of families with young ones in tow that were hiking up the mountain as we were coming down at around 10:30pm.

In the observatory deck there is a souvenir shop full of candy, cards, mugs, etc. There's even a few tables to fill out a postcard and send it back home! (Once purchased, the postcards come with stamps).  Now, there are a lot of lines involved in this. Since I was visiting Namsangol Hanok Village nearby, my friends and I decided to do the N Seoul Tower next. You can walk from the Village (probably around an hour+?), all up-hill. I decided not to do this after walking half-way up.  The first line we encountered was the line to use the gondola to bring us to the top of the hill (where the N Seoul Tower is located). The line to buy the ticket and get on the gondola was probably an hour.  Once we arrived at the N Seoul Tower there was tons of people touring around. If you're a couple planning on visit, bring an (engraved) lock! There are fences and sculptures lined with locks.  The next lineup was the lineup to take the elevator to the top of the Seoul Tower. The lineup wasn't too bad, probably around 15-30 minutes. Once inside the conservatory, the area was packed with people. Note: We went around late-afternoon just as the sun was setting. The sitting areas were taken up and it was hard to find a good spot to stand by the window for the view. However, once the sun set the view was beautiful.  Once all was said and done, there was a line up to go back down the tower, and another one to take the gondola back.  All in all, a great view, cool souvenirs, and pretty budget friendly.","Written August 17, 2016"

There is a post office box in the tower, so for a small fee you can buy a postcard and send to friends. When you have had enough of the view you can venture back to the ground level to buy food and drinks. Its the usual tourist food, but its not too bad.

You will not see Seoul like this unless you take a helicopter tour which no doubt would cost significantly more than catching the cable car to the tower and paying the extra (just 10,000w) to go up the tower to the observation decks. You MUST do this!!!  We'd eaten before heading up and would recommend using the toilet just after you've paid for the cable car. We waited about 45 mins, through patches of no air con and lovely air con... need to be patient. It's worth it!  The main area at the base of the tower is lovely. Despite lots of visitors, it feels relaxed and there's space to step back and take it all in. Lovely planting and pergolas, some of which provide scenic backdrops for photo opportunities. Of course, plenty of opportunity to buy a padlock, personalise and add it to your choice of locations dotted around... Tastefully done by the way.  On the top observation there are sweet and souvenir shops and opportunity to buy, write and post postcards... Perfect! This area is REALLY busy! Once you're done, take the stairs down a level. Here it is MUCH quieter. You learn more from the info quotes on the windows and can buy a drink and sit peacefully taking in the stunning views. It's from this level you catch the lift to return to the base of the tower.

The final ascent to the top of the tower does cost you an extra fee though, which is where the Teddy Bear Museum was also located. The view isn't that exciting, just lots of buildings. I think that's the only reason to go up to the top as I can't imagine the view of skyscrapers and residential towers would be that exciting from a few metres higher.

By the time you get to the tower proper, you are already high above the city and going up to the observation deck does not really add to the overall experience.  If I go again, I would stick to the restaurants on the main concourse for a beer or a snack, even the Family Mart for a cold Hite and a bag of Kimchi potato chips at one of the picnic tables is quite OK, and forego the observation deck part.  Access is via a short, but steep walk from the bus parking lot and takes 15 minutes or so; should be no problem unless you have mobility issues. There is no direct access to the concourse at the tower itself by bus or taxi. As always in Korea, there are lots of immaculate washrooms close by.","Written July 9, 2016"

Wear comfortable clothes and trainers and in case take an umbrella as rainy season. Both views are good the day and night .

At the base of the tower, around the other side is a Starbucks, but it is a little hard to find.

There is a shop at the bottom of the cabin which offers all kind of merchandise - don't be tempted, as prices are atrocious and you can get things twice as cheap in the town.  Purchase a return ticket - don't be tempted to purchase a ticket with a meal- and off you go.  There is a lift that could take you up the 5 flights of stairs, but only if you're very old or very pregnant :) - we braved the lift anyway and were told that we have to be ""punished"" by waiting 10 min for such ""disobedience"". The visitors are lined up in a very ""military"" / ""communist regime"" style - you do what you told! - but this is all part of the experience!  Up the top, there are more steps to conquer - then, you're (almost) at the top. The views are great, and there are plenty of opportunities for the photographs and selfies.  There is a concert available on a daily basis , - worth watching for a bit, and there are plants of eateries up the top, although the prices are higher that in downtown Seoul.

The cable car is worth it going up but if it's busy save your money walk down using one way ticket. It is a steep walk up from the street. Views are great you can see the expanse that is Seoul. There are 1000s of locks attached to the fence like on the Parisian bridge and you can buy them on-site.

3334,TravelwithAMO,4.0,"I lived in S. Korea for two years and the best time of year to visit the country is spring and fall. The weather is perfect that time of year (frigid cold in winter and more humid than FL in summer with lots of rain). Better than the weather though is the air clarity and quality. So I recommend hitting up Seoul tower in the spring or fall because the air is more likely to be clear and less polluted. If you get there in late April/ May you are going to hit the yellow dust but you will see the flowering trees and flowers. In the fall the trees offer so many different colors. We went to the tower at sunset which gave us amazing sunset photos (until the rain hit us). There is a shuttle that will take you from the bottom of the hill to the top and a railcar. We took the shuttle, but man the lines can be long and the later the day the less busses so it's hard to catch one. We did not go up the tower, I enjoyed stayed down watching the city and mingling with the people enjoying the space. We left around 8-9 pm and there were hardly any buses running so we walked down.","Written May 29, 2016"

It was so beautiful to watch the city light up at night as the sun set. I highly recommend visiting later in the day so you can witness the sunset. We did a ton of sightseeing that day so we opted for the cable car. The price is minimal and it saved us a ton more walking/stairs. The cable car is popular so be prepared to wait in line headed in both directions. There is a restaurant in the tower that offers dinner as well as snack and coffee counters.  It is traditional for couples to leave a lock on the rails at the top of the hill. My husband and I purchased a love lock from the store.

The N Tower makes you realise and appreciate what it looks likes to gave millions of people living in a relatively small amount of space. The views will leave you in awe and make this a must see in Seoul.  The price is low compared to similar places in other cities around the world: only 10000 won.  You can get there by hiking up the hill which is actually really nice or getting the cable car (walk from Myeongdong tube station to cable car about 10 minutes). You can probably get a taxi up as well.  Best to go on a weekday to avoid crowds. We went along the afternoon around 4 and we actually didn't need to queue up for the lift at all.

The trip up the tower is by express lift and the beer combo gets you two beers for less than the price of one. The usual photo booths operate on the way up, which explains the long queues going in.

Then we bought cable car tickets and waited in a long queue for almost an hour. (It was a Saturday.) The cable car took us to the base of the N Seoul Tower. My wife and I contributed two ""love-locks"" to the thousands that were already there.  We went to the observation deck of the tower using a lift. I didn't find the deck or the view that impressive. Of course, you get a good view of Seoul City. But somehow that didn't impress me.  When we returned to the base of the tower, it was 9 pm. We were fortunate to witness a electronic dance music (EDM) concert for free. Then we returned to our hotel.  I was looking forward to walking my way up and then down.

Restaurants and souvenir shop is also available up there should you need a bite or coffee break. On a side note, after taking the cablecar ride down, you may choose to walk down to the Main Street ( appro ximately10 mins ) which have a children animated museum.

3464,Scott H,5.0,"Namsan tower has changed drastically since our last visit there in 1983, at that time for security reasons it was prohibitive to take pictures from the tower. Even though it has become more touristy it is still a great place to visit. You have to take a bus to the tower; you cannot drive yourself or take a taxi to the tower. However buses are plentiful and it is inexpensive just use your T-Money card or pay in won. Have to walk to the tower once dropped off by the bus. It is a nice uphill walk. The only drawback is there are a lot of Chinese tourist and their social etiquette is probably worst than Koreans, they are loud and will just walk over you to get that perfect picture of a flower that everyone else is taking a picture of. Once you get to the tower it costs 10,000 won per person where all the information is in Korean, you can buy a package ticket which includes popcorn and a drink of choice (soda or beer.) Take the elevator up to the observation platform and see an amazing sight of Seoul, great to take pictures during the day, catch the sunset, and then the city lights. Take a pair of binoculars they will be helpful. No time limit and you can stay until closing at 10:30. Minimal lines for the elevator, there are a lot of clean bathrooms and many places to eat. Have to take a bus #3 off of Namsan which was cheap down to the Hamilton Hotel. Overall it is a very nice experience and I highly recommend it. NOTE: Namsan means South Mountain so the tower is the South Mountain Tower (Namsan Tower) the N does not mean north it means Namsan and it confuses a lot of foreigners, so adhere to this and you won‚Äôt be a confused tourist.","Written April 17, 2016"

Th cable car to reach the tower is very nice too and offers nice views on central Seoul and the mountains.","Written April 11, 2016"

The day we were there, visibility was low. We still decided to head up to the observatory deck and was disappointed as we were unable to see the scenary clearly.

Once up to the base of the tower by cable car, there are shops and a few things to see, but there are a lot of people awaiting their elevator time slot so it can be crowded. The views from the top are nice and the city lights are very pretty. The line to come down can get long so be careful you aren't stuck at the top near closing time, as you have to remember you need to take not only the elevator down but the cable car (or a long walk down the stairs).

We planned to arrive during sunset and the hotel I was staying is pretty nearby, so we decided to walk on over. The walk up to the cable car station wasn't bad at all, probably because there is this elevator/ramp hybrid thing that helps you up this last steep portion. The cable cars were really cool to ride in although they do kind of pack you in since there are a lot of people.  Once you get to the top you have to climb a few more flights of stairs, which isn't bad, but may be for those with mobility issues. Once you get close to the top you can start to see all the locks of love. There were quite a few vendors selling locks so those looking to lock their love last minute don't have to worry. The view below the tower is really gorgeous although it was a bit windy when we went. There are quite a few restaurants/shops around the bottom of the tower for those who are hungry from the climb.  The tower costs an additional extra to go up to and we bought the package deal in which popcorn/drinks are included. It's funny how they play this scene that you're blasting off to space as you ascend in the elevator. Once you get to the top of the tower, it's pretty much a 360 degree view of Seoul with souvenir shops in the middle. I like how on each window it tells you how far you are from a major city in the world and it's nice to sit down and chill next to a pretty view .

There are restos and coffee shops and also a gift shop. To go up the Tower, you have to pay an additional amount which I forgot. Too bad it was a bit cloudy the day that we went so you couldn't really appreciate the view. Still a nice place to go to and include in your itinerary :)","Written March 14, 2016"

The first time I went it was foggy and I couldn't really see much so they give me a ticket to go back. This was good for me because I was in Korea for a year but not so good if you are only there for a short period of time. So it's definitely worth checking the weather before going. I've been both day and night time. During the day it's a nice walk through Namsan Park up to the tower and there was different games and activities going on outside of the tower. On the night time the tower is lit up and the views from the top were amazing! So it really just depends what you want to see. I've walked up and took the cable car. The walk was nice but can take a while so again it depends if you like the walk or just want to see the tower.

At the tower we were a bit confused about which ticket to buy. There was the observation tower and a combined Tower and Pavilion ticket, but it was not clear what the Pavilion actually was. Finally we bought a beer package which was access to the observation tower for 2 persons and a beer each for 26,000 in total. Not bad considering the tower alone would have been 20,000. cheapest beer we had in Seoul ha ha. You need to collect your beer though before you take the elevator to the top.  The views are pretty average. Its not like the Eiffel tower where you are looking down on so many historic places. Here you pretty much just see a concrete jungle.

We reached there by bus from Chungmuro station. The bus was over crowded. We reached and saw a big croud towards Seoul Tower. ( It remind me of Durga Puja in my hometown Kolkata). I was a bit disappointed. Then we reached the tower by walking. ( I want to visit again by cable car or by hiking through Namsin Tower).  It was a huge queue in front of the ticket counter. anyhow we took a ticket for Alive museum and the tower observatory. We entered the alive museum and our mood changed totally. The alive museum might look childish to most of us (I also thought in the beginning). But I bet everyone will enjoy this museum. After that we reached the observatory.  I was almost the time of sunset. We saw the entire city. It looked amazing. We stayed there for almost one and half hours and enjoyed the scenes outside. The city of Seoul at night with supermoon is a lifetime experience to me. The traffic on the both sides of Han river looks like golden necklace.  Its worth visiting Seoul tower at night. But I will try to visit Seoul Tower in a weekday when there will be a little crowd.","Written January 28, 2016"

I would suggest you bring your own padlock as it comes by cheaper than the ones they're selling up here which is about 8000 won each. However from my last visir here in 2013 i've locked my padlock at the love lock gate but when I came earlier this year it was gone (most probably cut). When my friend have a conversation with the coffee shop worker there he said the worker there cut some padlocks every other year in order to make space for new ones to bet put. I noticed the ones left there are quite old as they are very rusty, my assumption is maybe they left the old rusty ones as a symbol of everlasting love (don't judge me here I'm only assuming lol).

3661,JHL,4.0,"If you want to go up to the observatory, you'd better reach N Seoul Tower before 4 pm. Depending on the date, you may be waiting for 2~3 hours and you can identify buildings before sundown. Sometimes it's hard to see things at night.  Sometimes (not that often) there are events such as folk performances, fireworks and so on. If it's once-in-a-life visit, you'd better check the website.  As of Dec 2015, N Seoul Tower Plaza is opened. It's a connected shopping mall with some exhibition area and restaurants. You can spend some more time there.  There are several routes to head N Seoul Tower. As well as subway and taxi aren't around, there are just a few ways to take you there. You may waste time finding bus stops or ropeway. Therefore, if time is enough, for healthy travelers, I recommend to take a walk from the Namsan Library. It takes about 30~50 min from there.  Bus: Bus stops are from the northeast way and this is one way road.

They sell pretty locks there for about 5-6USD that come with a marker pen so you can write on your lock before you attach it to a rail or love tree. On the day we went, the skies were clear and there was a free performance going on. They do offer food, lots of photo opportunities and a nice way to enjoy a free tourist site.  You can either take a bus or the tram. Taxis are not allowed due to government restrictions trying to reduce air pollution. If you take the tram, just a block over is the famous donkatsu block.

You can buy several different ticket packages - we have bought combine ticket for Alive Museum and Observatory and it was worth. Even the elevator ride to the Observatory is an attraction as you ""feel"" you are riding to the sky.  Only thing, that made a little bad impression on me, is then you are going to the elevator there is a narrow corridor and to pass it you are ""forced"" to make a photo, you got a number and later on top you can get your photo for 10,000 wons (~10$) - ofc you are not really forced to buy it, but it may feel a little bit as pulling tourists to spend more money on top of ticket prize.","Written January 10, 2016"

I visited N Seoul Tower on May 2015, it was actually spring but the cherry blossom has already fallen so all I can see was just green leavesüòÖ but it's still beautiful tho. To reach this place, you can walk (not really recommended), taking bus or taking cable car. I tried the last 2, and I might say that taking bus is a better choice. You can see the view outside your bus window and it's waaaay cheaper than just taking cable car (which I found a bit overprice).  When you're arriving in N Seoul Tower, make sure you enjoy all the views because it's really breathtaking during both day or night. Too bad when I came here, it's started to rain after night came. This place brings romantic feeling and I think you should visit the observatory when you're on your 1st visit (dont forget to download discount coupon from visitkorea website)","Written December 31, 2015"

3715,Caleb C,4.0,"It seems like a tower like this is a standard thing for lots of cities nowadays. The view is very good, especially during sunset, snow (sometimes), or other random times. The price isn't cheap, but nothing this high in the sky is. The worst thing is just how busy it can be at times, but it seems difficult to predict really. I've been 3 or 4 times and the wait has ranged from 1.5 hours to nothing. So be prepared for a bit of a wait, but you will have a great view of the city.  The cable car is necessary for anyone not wanting to do quite the hike. So if anyone in your group has any difficulty whatsoever with walking uphill for quite a while, pay for the cable car.","Written December 30, 2015"

It's a short ride. The cable requires one to travel to the starting point, which I don't think is worth the cost to ride. The cheapest method is to walk up the hill using the numerous paths up to the top (don't do this if you're not in good shape!). Food is available, but for a price. Might be a bit steep to some. The restaurant on top of the tower requires a reservation.","Written December 29, 2015"

3719,Robert W,5.0,"On a cold, foggy yet partially sunny Sunday in deep mid-winter in Seoul, I ventured off in a bus with my local friend to the Namsan Seoul Tower, one of the landmarks overlooking the metropolis that is Seoul. The crowds were busy but with no queue going up the tower. Having waved to King Kong who was resting on the lower side of the Tower, we were whizzed up to about level 70 and stunning views over Seoul. The views were excellent and the viewing deck had clear floor to ceiling windows for fantastic views. Afterwards, we enjoyed a traditional warrior dance routine on the forecourt while taking in a beer and pop corn, part of the ticket price. And, following that famous Parisian Bridge over the Seine, there are balconies full of padlocks were distant lovers and locals have left their hearts in Seoul! A great spot and one not to be missed as busses regularly took you up and down the Mountain to Seoul central. Or in spring and autumn, the walk down the hill takes in numerous looking points and the park itself.","Written December 28, 2015"

Now there are a few ways to get to the tower, each as it's own lure. I took the city bus as it's cheap and frequent. You can also take a cable car and that was enticing, but cost three almost four times more than the bus. The cable car would be good for less able bodied people. The bus drops you off and you have a short steep stroll/hike up the last bit of road to the tower itself. And if you like popcorn and soda get the couples set as it's only 1,000won more and you get snacks!","Written December 27, 2015"

When I came here it was so misty you could see nothing from the windows - though the mist was at the level of the top of the tower so no one realised this beforehand. I feel like the ethical thing for the operators to do would be to warn visitors, instead of just taking our money only for us to come straight back down.  That said, the walk up the hill to the tower was lovely and serene. There is a lively atmosphere and it is quite a romantic spot.

3728,Melissa P,3.0,"So first of all, let me start off by saying that I believe this place is well worth a visit. However, my experience left a lot to be desired. My husband planned to take me up the tower for a beautiful & romantic dinner. We heard there was a Michelin star restaurant as well as a variety of other fine and casual eateries so we were really looking forward to a lovely date-night. In short, we got up to the top a few minutes too late--literally all restaurants/food establishments were either closed or closing by the time we made it to the top by cable car. And it was only 9:30. Perhaps we're late eaters BUT it would have been really nice to know this information in advance. So the communication (or lack thereof) is the one downfall of this place. We basically got to the top, spent a couple of minutes looking around, and needed to head back down as we were so hungry and had deliberately eaten a very light lunch so that we could enjoy our dinner. So disappointing....truly. We will for sure go back and plan our time better now that we know what we do about this place. View is stunning, cable car well organized (though expect to wait over an hour for a ride to the top!) and I highly recommend setting aside a lot of time for exploring!","Written December 22, 2015"

3742,Kylie F,4.0,"I went up last night, attempting to arrive to watch the sunset. It was the clearest day imaginable but unfortunately the glass windows (like many viewing towers) are sort of blurry so the view looked like it was through smog. When you get back outside the air is crystal clear. I got better photos outside on the ground (albeit not as high) - the ones from inside arent even worth keeping. The sunset wasnt actually visible at all, the sun just dropped behind clouds on the horizon, there were no pinks or reds. It was a magnificient view over the city and not at all crowded. Maybe because it is winter.  Also if you want to go up the tower at a certain time, be aware that if you buy the Alive museum tour + Observation deck package they try to make you go in the museum first. I refused and went straight up in order not to miss sunset and then of course they wouldnt let me go into the museum.  There is also a bizarre pricing policy at the ticket booth that makes you think you have to pay for food in advance if you want to eat? It seemed like you could just buy food (if you wanted) from the cafe or the Korean BBQ on the floor below the observation deck. Of course if you want to eat in the proper restaurants you must need to pay for these in advance.  Also at just above the cable car station is a bar/restaurant. I decided I needed a drink and went in thinking I could also get some dinner. The offerings were very limited with crumbed pork cutlets being offered, omelette and rice, a garden salad (Looked awful - 13,000 won) and very unappetising looking japanese udon noodles. Prices were on the steep side for the offerings. There is a great view over the city out the window and the glass of house wine was OK.

We spent the morning at the Live Art museum which was a lot of fun, would recommend getting there early as would think it'll get very busy later in the day.

The souvenir had a few things to offer. I'm not one to usually spend money St souvenir shops but they had a cool scratch out map that I had been looking for! Admittedly the views from the top were really nice on a clear day. Perfectly clear days are really rare in Seoul so I was really fortunate. And no... I couldn't see my house. But I could see some landmarks and it offered a nice view of the city, although you can enjoy similar views from Naksan, bukhansan, and other mountains in the region.

You can take a bus or cable car to the top of the hill and a short 200 meter walk up a few stairs to the tower. If by bus the walk it is a bit further.  I highly recommend taking a taxi to the base of the cable car, our hotel told us we could walk it from Myeng-dong station, it is a very long walk and uphill so i do suggest a taxi to the base of the cable car station.  The view is pretty impressive, it was a bit foggy during the time i went up but still a great view. There are restaurants and dessert shops so you can sit down and enjoy the scenery and it isn't overpriced like some touristy places.  To go up the tower you do have to pay extra ontop of the cable car fee, there are many options, with food and alcohol sets to go to the top, but you can pay just to go up and its not to costly, so when checking the prices make sure you look at all options they tend to not promote just going up and try to get you to buy set package tickets which are a bit pricey imho.","Written October 21, 2015"

At the second place you must buy gondola ticket to go to top mountain, have 2 selection one way or return (better choose return, more cheaper). You must queue again for use the huge gondola glass, on the way to top mountain you can see all city from inside gondola. And finally we on top of mountain aka N Seoul tower the land mark of korea.  First view you can see almost beautiful real tree and love lock tree anywhere and everywhere hahaha. If you forget bring your love lock don't worry they sell a unique lock, and again better buy 2 for more cheaper and get free permanent pen for write you love on that lock (better buy that lock in n seoul tower store in upstairs, again more cheap).  You can going to top tower buy tickets with selection with drink and popcorn or just buy the ticket ( again buy 2 ticket with drink and popcorn was cheaper ).

There are loads of photo opportunities and needless to say it was extremely busy. I've never seen so many 'selfies'.

Once you reach the N Seoul Tower at the time, there are numerous other attractions like the Alive Museum, souvenir shops and restaurants. There are also food stands where you can purchase the potato tower snack. You can also choose to pay 7,000 won to go into the observatory.

There are maps and signs everywhere so you can't get lost. Once at the top, we watched some street performances, stopped by the N Tower gift shop and ate Black bean noodles.

The 3 mins cable car ride is a quick and convenient way to get up the mountain if you can't spare the time and energy (or fitness) to make it up on foot. I was there at about 930 am and got down to Myeongdong by 1130 am. I wanted to miss th crowd and starting early is highly recommended or it will be quite impossible to take good pictures of the place.

3998,TravelConfidential,4.0,"Seoul Tower is one of the those touristy landmark places that every major city seems to have. That being said, you know to expect hordes of tourists going in, so prep your yourself mentally ahead of time. There are a lot of locals there as well though, because the scenery surrounding Seoul Tower is quite beautiful. It's just a great spot to relax. That scenic vibe has a lot to do with why you'll see families, couples, groups of friends and even solo travelers hanging around here. Snapping up photos, riding to the top of the tower to send a postcard to a friend overseas, or putting a lock of love on the ""trees"" are all par for the course and it's all a bit cheesy in my opinion, but nonetheless enjoyable and a spot to check off on your ""vacation to Seoul"" list.  I enjoyed a Korean meal at a restaurant (HanCook) at the base of the tower and the food and view were both spectacular. Don't go thinking that the food is lame, theme park quality food. My particular visit felt like something out of a Korean drama as families were smiling and letting me take pictures of them and their adorable babies. My friend and I walked up to the Tower, which is quite a trek, but you'll thank me later for the views you'll experience. Access to the tower will run you 9,000 won (roughly 7.60 USD at the time of this review,) which is a great price. Watch the ceiling on the elevator ride up.

People watching is also great here, as most of the people coming up to the tower are tourists (both from Korea, and even more so, from around the world).

The height of Mt.Namson is 243 meters and the top of the tower is on 237 meters above the ground. There are four observation levels from whom You may have the fascinating views of the Seoul.

Now that I've been to the observation deck (which is over priced in my opinion) I'd like to say don't waste your time, money or energy going to N Seoul Tower. There are better things to do and see in Seoul!!  Problems #1. Getting There: sure you can take the cable cars (but from what I've read they're expensive, they pack you in like sardines and the trek there isn't easy) OR you could cram yourself onto the bus (might actually be the best idea looking back, wish we would have done this) OR you walk (the taxi driver dropped us off ""as close as he could get"" and let me tell you, it was farther than we thought, we crammed ourselves on a bus when we left). #2. Way, way, way too many people (I think I complain about this everywhere I go in Seoul) but this was worse because the space was so small. #3. The price for going up just for a view of Seoul is a bit excessive. Then again if it was any cheaper I'm sure they'd have even MORE people coming to this place! #4.

If you decide to go up,sunset is a beautiful it popular time - get there much earlier than you think is necessary, especially if by cable car ad the line backs up quickly.  Best to take the bus to the top, which runs frequently straight to the top since taxis can't go up.

4102,macropolotea,5.0,"We went to the Seoul tower in the late afternoon as we wanted to view the skylines in the evening. Beautiful view of Seoul. Seoul Tower can be accessible through Myeong Dong. We were walking around Myeong Dong and decided to visit the tower impromptu.  First you have to get to the cable car/tram to get you to the Seoul Tower uphill. We took the long and uncomfortable way of walking up through their residences on a very very steep hill to the cable car station. The correct way to reach the cable car station is actually through the movable tram(looks more like a movable lift where you have to press the buttons) up and you will reached the cable car station. From there, the cable car will take you up to Seoul Tower. For us it was a relax one as there were few people. Guessed it has to do with the Mers outbreak in Korea. We only took 10minutes to wait for the cable car and another 5 minutes to reach to the top. Once you reached the top, you have to climb steps up to Seoul Tower. Slowly enjoy this while you can as you can gasp the view of Seoul and take photos along the way. There were vendors selling locks which you could buy and write your and your loved ones names on it and lock it. There are lots of locks there. Once we reached the top of the hill, there are the ticketing counter, restaurants, ice-cream cafes, gifts shops, pharmacy. We went around the deck surrounding the tower to take photos of the scenery before heading up to the tower. Once we are up in the tower, we are mesmerized by the spectacular view. We took many photos up there and had our tea-break at the cafee TwoSome. The most beautiful scene I had captured are taken from the restroom. The restroom is very clean and had a beautifully unblock view of the Seoul City. Recommended to visit the tower during late afternoon to evening to catch the sunset!!

4106,Duhyun K,4.0,"I proposed to my wife here. So it's quite a meaningful place to me. The walk to the tower is a quite long so if you're not in the mood or dress for a climb then I suggest you take the bus. The bus comes routinely at the foot of the hill where the tower is situated. Once you get to the top of the hill you will be able to see the views, restaurants, and also live performances. To get into the actual tower you have to pay a fee and wait in the long line to get to the very top floor. So if you not one for lines, go on a weekday, it's usually not that busy on a weekday. The scenery surrounding the tower is quite nice, and there are various walking/jogging courses you can take to reach the tower. It is also connected to a park. Many of my friends living in Korea like to come here because there are not many places in Seoul where you can enjoy open nature. All in all it's one of our top tourist destinations and not one to be missed.","Written July 21, 2015"

I do not recommend doing this when it is extremely warm in Korea as the humidity is very high and if you not accustomed to it could cause you great harm.  I was looking forward to seeing the N. Seoul Tower from the minute of booking my trip to Seoul. I booked a nite trip with Koridoor (we stopped at other locations as well as the N.Seoul Tower). The elevator ride up was great. I LOVED the view from up there however trying to take photos were hard because of the glare off the glass so that ruined it for me because I couldn't get the great shots that I wanted to get. If taking pictures really isn't at the top of your list then YES, it is a must see other than that go in the day time and the glares from the indoor lights may not affect your pictures as much as the night time views.  Before going up on the tower there is some areas to sit around and some shops to purchase food/snacks such as Coldstone. They also have the love lock area. You can purchase a lock from inside the gift store and put a lock on there. The view from there reminds of looking out over any city at night.

So we still needed to go up the tower itself (do I need to tell that by the time we were at this point, on top of the mountain, the sun had set few hours ago already). So going up the hill where the tower is is one part of the journey, and costs two elevator tickets and after that you buy the ticket to get up the tower. Here you have the same problem I find lots of sightseeing towers to have- the glasses are round and in the middle of the tower theres a souvenir shop which lights up the whole room so if you try to take a picture you end up having nothing but background light in it..

Its obviously a great view being up so high, once at the top of the there are plenty of picture opportunities, there also decent pictures to be taken at the base of the tower. Also the guys washroom is great because the urinals have the most amazing view you've ever had while reliving yourself. We went on a weekday i think its slightly cheaper than the weekend but really our currency is valued much higher than theirs so most everything is relatively inexpensive.

4166,Andy1112013,3.0,"I've been here once before so I knew what to expect. But I didn't get that. Maybe their budget was cut, or maybe it was MERS to blame, but...  The exhibition, one of those live art deals where you can be a part of the art, was quite lame. I guess it was exactly as described but the atmosphere was empty and there's just not much excitement to have when you can really only do the pose they show you, nothing unique about your experience.  Then there's a SECOND hall, which looked totally devoid of people and I can see why. One is enough.  Going up to the observatory and you get the good views. I've been up enough buildings to know this is your bog standard deal. I actually found the 63 building view to be far superior, because you're closer to stuff for viewing, not up a mountain. the 63 building is in a place where you can see all the traffic and detail, and it's such an unpopular tourist attraction nowadays it takes no time and you get to see all round. So maybe check that out instead.  When I left, I expected the scheduled lights display on the Seoul Tower, which, when I was there a few years back came with music and 3d laser stuff and animations on the floor. This time, I got what seemed to be 3 minutes of silent advertisement on the tower, and nothing else. What an incredible disappointment. I was building up to that moment the whole time. I can only hope it was a one-off thing due to MERS.  Getting back down is hugely inconvenient since there are no taxis or buses, so you have to get this weird elevator down a side cliff, onto the road and walk 15 minutes or so to the subway. And there were no directions or instructions on how to do that; I had to ask a car park ticket officer.","Written June 27, 2015"

Upon reaching where the buses park for transport up and down the mountain there is a small convenient store and restrooms before you enter into the attraction. Another steep pavement hike and we had arrived. Ice cream and other food vendors were plentiful along with a gift shop. There were several locks of love art projects structured like Christmas trees on one side and a stage on the other. Unfortunately there were no acts during this time period. There is an observatory higher up with a view that would not disappoint on a clear day. I don‚Äôt know if it was the smog of pollution fogging up the view the day I visited or the clouds.

Namsan Mountain can get crowded, especially during the weekend and at sunset but the view is so worth it. Try going during the day as the wait for the cable car can be several hours later in the day, or, if you're up for it, walk to the top. There are restaurants and an area where lovers buy locks, write their names on them , then lock them to the fence and throw away the key, symbolic of their eternal love. There are thousands, if not tens of thousands of locks. It's a little awe-inspiring to see so many locks.  This was my favourite place to see Seoul and I think it could be yours as well.

We were there at 8am, so perhaps they only do cleaning later in the morning...but for a place that attracts a lot of tourists highly recommend they have it presentable all the time.  Would have given it high rating if it was cleaner. So i'm giving it only very good rating for only the actual hike.","Written June 4, 2015"

Go to the observatory tower only your travel budget allow because there's nothing much fun except that you can view the scenery in higher position.

However the price with inflated holidays pricing taking a simple main close to $200 I decided just to take in the view. The view from down below is great and worth the hour long queue for the cable car. This is then followed by a 30 minute queue to go up the Namsan tower itself. Of course then you have to queue for another 30 minutes to get down the tower and another 45 minutes to get down on the cable car.

It might be hard for older people, but they can do it with some patience.  What greets you are vandalized statues and flowers.  There are alot of things to do in the tower, such us go up the observatory, go to the alive museum, place a love lock, view the pavilion and eat up.  To focus more on the tower, the lines could get long with the tourists pouring in. The elevator, only one was working at our time, can fit around 10-12 people.

We were warned about a long queue to go up the tower, but after purchasing our tickets, the wait was only about 30 minutes, the view from the top was fantastic, well worth the wait. The weather was fairly clear so the whole of Seoul was displayed below us. After circumnavigating the observation flkoor, taking lots of pictures. There was a further wait to descend. The Beacons were seen and then the trip down the hill was facilitated by the Cable Car (cost of 6,000W per person) and then followed by the Funicular (free) to get down to the City level.

It was definitely more interesting than I thought it would be to see how densely populated and the number of high rise apartment and office buildings make up Seoul and with almost every flat piece of land having a high rise on it. I am glad I arrived early in the day (9:45am) as many more people were arriving when I left. This is great way to get your bearings and understand the layout of Seoul. Also important for you to know that they take everyones picture before you step in the elevators and sell them to you at the top at the observation deck. The park like setting on the walk up the hill is very nice. I was also surprised to see the many love locks connected to the fences and other areas at this site. This was made popular by a Korean soap opera and considered very romantic thing to do...which I agree is.

DO bring your own lock if you want to do that, the locks they sell on site are very pricey.  Proceeding from the love locks area, you'll reach the actual Namsan Tower. Get tickets at the outside counter before going up. Interesting that they sell popcorn + drinks + observatory packages, though you can just go for the observatory tickets if you don't want the extras. 9000 won for a single ticket IIRC.  The view from the top is quite impressive. Each glass pane features the name of major cities in its general direction. You'll be able to send a postcard back to your country from the gift shop.

There's no specific timing for how long u can use it, but be nice! :) The scenery is very nice, with trees and beautiful view of the city. we didnt get in the N seoul tower until after about 40minutes of taking pics! There's a love locks place ( many locks with couples name) which i didnt find too interesting, but many people take pics there - i dunno why. Sooo we finally got in the N seoul tower building and bought combo tickets of observatory and alive museum. We werent allowed to go to the observatory before visiting the museum - not sure why. The alive museum is like a 3d art/ trick eye, which was ok n fun for taking pics. There are 2 alive museums, the 2nd one was a bit scary with us getting lost in the maze n my 5 yr old girl cried in panic. After visiting both museums, we went up to the observatory room.

The photo opportunities when you get to the tower are incredible and there are also padlock walls as you'd have seen around the world. You can enjoy restaurants here or go even further up within the tower for greater views. Our small children didn't want us to keep them out any longer so we enjoyed our time up there and perhaps if i could do this again, i'd go up in the afternoon instead of the evening after dinner so that we could have stayed longer and enjoyed the sun setting from the top.","Written February 16, 2015"

Let's just say on our departure I had some choice words with the other cabbies that tried to charge a set fee of ‚Ç©20,000 but we found out that Myeongdong Station was literally down the hill from the Lift Cars by walking so duckies saved.  I suggest going at night because the view of Seoul is breath taking. It is amazing to see how much Seoul changed from my time as a kid in the '80s until now. I wish the Army would allow me to stay longer but unfortunately that is not an option.  Check out the Bear Museum inside. I know the kids will get a kick out of it and don't forget the skydeck.

If you choose the stairs, athletic or hiking shoes are suggested although I did see some Asian women climbing the stairs with 4 inch heels. I also saw one man in his upper 80's making the climb.  The pollution in Seoul isn't publicised as much as some other Asian venues but is worth considering, although some great views are available, a bad pollution day makes short range photography manageable but city view shots may be entirely obscured.  There are multiple restaurants, grab joints, beverages, trinket shops, and a view from the top of the tower available but it was too polluted when I visited to merit going up the tower and there are 360 degree views available from the plaza at the base of the tower.","Written February 12, 2015"

Great view on top of it, make sure the weather is clear. Yes it's very cold during winter.  You can have your Lunch or Dinner there, there's a Burger bar and some casual food court. Ice-cream place and an official Teddy Bear korea store.  The ticketing is easy, very straight forward and so far their english is ok and no problem buying tickets.

Vending machines for drinks and hot drinks.  There's an Alive Museum which you can when you go to Insadong or Insadong's Samzigil.

Luckily no one really ever checks so it is definitely possible to quite easily take your own photos of the panorama from the tower.

Don't take the cable car waste of money and takes forever to stand in the line. Don't go up into the tower itself either that will cost you more money and it is not really worth it.  My advice is that you either take the bus or even better hike up the mountain. Hiking to Namsan Tower from Myeongdong takes from 25-50 minutes depending on your speed. Walking can be very nice surrounded by trees. Once you reach the top of the mountain you have a great view over the cityscape.  If you buy food or snacks at the tower it is a bit expensive as well. The souvenir shop is quite good but also that a bit over priced.,"Written December 23, 2014"
4415,Stayoshi,3.0,"The unique thing about this tower, compared to other ""towers"" such as Eiffel Tower or Taipei 101 is that - this tower is located at the top of a hill - Namsan Hill. So, you can have pretty awesome view of the city, even by just hanging around the base of the tower.  We walked from our hotel at Myeongdong to the Tower, and got lost along the way. A kind lady showed us the way (she seems to be on her way to somewhere nearby the tower, so she just asked us to follow her). She led us through the labyrinth of small and hilly alleys, ti reach this ""elevator"", which brings us to the cable car station. We then took the short cable car ride, which brought us to almost at the base on the Tower (just a mere 3-5 min. hike up from there).  Saw a lot of tourists walked up the Namsan, but as it was very cold, we were glad that we opted for the Returned Ride Cable Car tickets.  We went there early in the morning (about 10am), before the crowd started streaming in, so we did not have to wait at all for the elevator ride nor the cable car ride. We walked around the top of the hill awhile and left just as bus loads of tourists arrived.  The view was quite good, but that is about all. Yeah, there is also this lover's lock thing, but perhaps I am not into Korean drama, so I didn't find it particularly interesting.","Written December 23, 2014"

However, the cable car is overpriced, the entrance to the top of the tower is overpriced, the shops are overpriced. Nothing very interesting about this place. There's this whole lot of weird locks around the area and they sell cheapo locks at such horrendous prices I wonder why in the world would anyone buy them!

Just like Eiffel Tower is for Paris. Another similar point between Eiffel Tower and Namsan tower is that they are the Mecca dating spot. I went here with a female friend, and although we weren't alone, we felt estranged among the sea of couples. Especially during night time. The panoramic view from on top of the hill is very stunning. You can see Seoul from atop. the city was glittering with lights.  Beware, its a lot of walking. The tower is on top of a hill, which is quite a ways off from the station. I've built up strlurdy calf muscles from all the hiking. I don't know if there is a bus, we went pretty late at night. You should check before you go. You only need to go halfway to the top of the hill to get to the skytrain station, and you can pay to ride one to the tower , but that fee does not include entrance to the tower. It can only get you to the foot of the tower, which is where I stopped. I was exhausted but satisfied with the view outside. They also have the souvenir store and a couple of restaurants outside, so its still cool if you don't go in. I bought some drinks and a neat spiraling looking potato snacks.

4440,Melissa G,5.0,"The N Seoul Tower is located at the top of Namsan (Mount Nam) and there are two ways to get there: (1) climb the stairs to the top for free; or (2) pay a small fee and wait in a fairly long line for the cable car to whisk you up to the top in no time at all. I chose to take the cable car up for the experience and to walk down after sunset. (I went on a Saturday - explains how busy it was.)  The grounds are fairly packed and there are some great photo opportunities along the way to the top (there is a ground level deck at the base of the tower where there are nice views of the city) and some tourist distractions (gift shop, etc.) in the tower.  This is a very popular place, so if you want to watch the sunset, you MUST arrive early - as early as FOUR HOURS in advance of the sunset. Plan for LONG line-ups at the cable-car building, for your ticket to go up the tower, then for the elevator to actually go pup (they make everyone take a green-screened photo that they try to sell to you later). The later you go, the LONGER the line-up! When I left after sunset, the line-ups were even longer than they were when I went up.  Once you get to the observation deck at the top, the views are simply breathtaking. If you are there for sunset, then even better. There is, of course a gift shop right at the top.

Since the top of the tower is closed with glass enclosure (unlike in say, Eiffel tower ) you feel a bit disconnected from the view.  To reach the tower you will have to walk around half KM from nearest bus stop and metro.  You can either walk all the way to the top, which can be bit taxing. Or take the option that I took, of taking cable car from mid way of the hill to the tower.  Do note that cable car entry may become crowded and will require you to wait for getting your turn.  Once in the tower complex you need to collect ticket for going to top of the tower in lift. View from is great, though you get a feeling that they have tried a bit to replicate Eiffel tower.

It used to be more beautiful, but it became too much of it everywhere. Nothing much unless you are so romantic to add yours.  I personally recommend everyone to take a cable to go up because only cable cars, yellow public shuttles and climbing are possible. Private cars and cabs are not allowed in the mountain.

Though you can always purchase them at the sourvenirs shop but at an escalated price. We spent around 2hrs on top and really enjoyed the nice scenery and the fresh air. There are a few eateries and cafes so no worries about where to get drinks and food. I must say that this place is a must go when you're in Seoul.

We didn't went up the observation tower as my wife is not into it but enjoyed the place still. There is a trick eye museum i believe, souvenir shops and a number of restos at a little higher price. Overall we stay at the N Seoul Tower for almost 3hrs and we went down now using the free shuttle bus stationed along the road near parked vehicles just outside the exit of cable car station.

You have two options to reach it. 1-take the cable car from near the Myeongdong station. 2-walk/hike through the Namsan park. If you feel energetic, I would definitely recommend the second way. It would take 20-30 minutes and the cable car actually does not take you a long distance. You would only save 1 kilometer or so. Along the path you would stop and see the city view from different angles. Once you are on top of the mountain, you can take a lift to the top of the tower but this is a little pricey and basically the view is the same.","Written November 3, 2014"

Going up the mountain and up the tower gives you an altitude of 500meters or so, with stunning view of most of the cities landmarks, including GyeongBokGung, Jongno, Dongdaemun Design Plaza, Lotte World Tower, Gangnam, Yeouido... Also great to get a glimse of the size of the city as well as the omnipresent nature (Han river, endless succession of hills and mountains).

4496,Jeff C,4.0,"I had a great visit to the N Seoul Tower with my wife around sunset in late October. While there is a beautiful view from the observation tower, it is crowded and is very akin to observation decks in skyscrapers in other big cities. I didn't find it particularly romantic, but ""Romance"" is highly pushed by the marketing within the tower. The ""thing to do"" at the base of the tower, is buy a key lock and lock it to one of the fences with you and your partners name on it. There are literally tens if not hundreds of thousands of these locks in designated area. It only costs the equivalent of a few dollars to purchase a lock and it is somewhat kitschy and fun to do. Some of the locks are on fences and others linked to tree-like structures that form a pattern of trees or other sculptures. Also, to note, there are two stories to the observation deck. Thus, if you are there at sunset and it is very crowded, I recommend going to the lower floor where there is less of a crowd. The hike up Mountain is a nice alternative to the cable car and includes great views and a nice park setting. It is well paved and not particularly steep, there are probably a few hundred steps on the way up. As long as you are in reasonably good shape (or just young), it shouldn't be difficult. The tower itself has several good, but very touristy restaurants at the base, including many Western establishments (Dunkin Donuts, Cold Stone Creamery, etc).","Written October 30, 2014"
4497,julietteBacolod,4.0,"The place is really accessible for tourists on DIY. From Myeongdong Station, you can ride the Namsan Cable Car for just less than 10 dollars roundtrip and you can walk your way to the tower passing at the Namsan Park. What we did: after visiting the War Memorial, we took a taxi then proceed to the bus stop/station and wait for the bus ( forgot the bus number but they have guides at the station). Bus fee: 1000 won. Or, if your feet aren't sore, you can have an uphill walk to the tower for about 20-30 minutes. Remember, the bus cannot bring you straight to the tower-you have to walk against gravity for around 5m... pretty tiring after a whole day tour. They have buffet packages plus entrance to the tower but we choose to pay 10,000 won for tower entrance with free popcorn and soft drinks. Too bad you cannot take good pictures at the tower as it is covered by glass unlike in the Baiyoke Hotel in Bangkok. For first timers, i think it's a must visit this place but once is quite enough.

The hike itself was really nice, and there were many different flowers and trees bordering the trail. Unfortunately, the view wasn't so spectacular since it was so humid and foggy the day that I went.  At the top, they definitely play up the love theme with heart flower arrangements, the chance to buy lover's locks (if you didn't bring your own) and attach it to the lock trees, and the benches are slanted inwards so that you sit closer to your loved one. I went to the restaurant on the main floor which was a bit pricey (also decided going up wasn't worth the $$ since you already can see out at the main level).  I think that other times during the year (Spring or Fall when it isn't so muggy) the view would be much nicer, or even at night when the tower is lit up.

My husband and I took a subway to Myeong-Dong; then, we walked (mind you, it's ALL uphill, so strollers, crutches, and wheelchairs will be a challenge! and once you get TO the mountain, they will be impossible, sadly) to the sky-lift that takes you (in groups of about 20 or so) to the middle of the mountain below the tower. Be sure to purchase the round-trip tickets for the sky-lift; or else you will be forced to walk alllllll the way down the massive staircase from the top to get back down.  (Sidenote: this is considered a very romantic, ""couples"" location; so, my husband and I were able to get a couples' ticket deal on the sky-lift. If you're in pairs of two, this is the way to go, because it saved some cash for sure.)  Once you arrive on the mountain, you will need to take the rest of the stairs to the top of the mountain where the tower sits. There are a LOT of stairs! Children will probably tire and need to be carried. The good news is that there are several platform areas with food and refreshments available for purchase. We saw beer, water, soda, juices, and all sorts of snack foods being offered to weary wanderers as they trek up the stairs to the top.  There are several areas all around the tower where you can take the most spectacular pictures and enjoy the amazing view of the city. It's 360 degrees all the way around; so, you can get nearly any angle of Seoul you wish. If you get vertigo, beware! Lots of opportunity to get dizzy. :-( But, it's truly worth it. I really believe you will not find better views of the city than right here at N. Seoul Tower. Also, it's worth noting that we went during the afternoon; but we've heard it's absolutely incredible at night with all the lights in the city sparkling around you.  If you're with your sweetheart bring a lock with your names and a special date on it to ""lock in love"" on the tower railing. There is a similar place like this in Paris (a love bridge), but I think the view here at Namsan far outweighs the bridge in Paris. Forgot a lock? No worries, they're sold right there on site (mind you, they are a lot more expensive at the tower!)!  There are several ""love benches"" (shaped in a ""V"" that forces the two sitting upon it to squeeze in close together), ""love lock trees"" (yes, trees made entirely of love locks), and other ""love"" related things that make for great photo ops.  There's a restaurant at the top of the tower, one at the bottom, and several, little shops and snack shops surrounding the tower too. We did not eat there, but everything smelled delicious!  We really lucked out the afternoon that we visited, because they were putting on a traditional, Korean martial arts display on the big open area near the tower. It was a FABULOUS performance, and afterwards they allowed the viewers to come down and touch and hold the weapons and such.  I cannot imagine traveling to Seoul (especially for the first time) without a visit to N. Seoul Tower! There's a reason all the tourists go there - it's incredible and there is absolutely NO better way to view Seoul in all it's splendor than from the vistas of the tower itself. Go during the week instead of a weekend, and soak up the incredible site that is Seoul!","Written September 3, 2014"

4543,chatthefoodie,4.0,"My second visit of N Seoul Tower was better than the first because I actually went up to take in the view. I am wary of city towers because of the crowds but N Seoul was not too busy when I got there and maybe better organized than many similar structures. The view was stunning, but I actually enjoyed the fun atmosphere with people taking selfies, just hanging out or ogling the famous love padlocks area below. It is a popular stop for most Seoul visitors with good reason. On a sunny day photos do come out very well. The food options here are not great but serviceable enough with burgers and fast food. The souvenir shops are nice and service efficient. The ride up Namsan was quite good. I appreciated the fact that Seoul is still pretty much a hilly kind of city, and you are never too far from nature and lots of greenery. N Seoul Tower and Namsan can be a pleasant change of pace from the furious shopping most do when visiting the city.","Written September 2, 2014"
4544,Mooglets,4.0,"I've been before, (I live here in Seoul) and enjoyed it every time, this time I took my mother up to see it. Admittedly, we got a little lost trying to find the right way up to the tower - tried walking it first, but evidently used the wrong road, which while a very nice walk, took us around the mountain instead of up it, so we went back and took the skycar up instead. That gives some great views, but is very crowded, only use it if you don't mind getting up close and personal with strangers! The tower itself is ok, the views from the top are fantastic, even on dull days - and at night the city lights up gorgeously. It is very crowded up top, and the queue can take a while, but if you don't mind a wait, it's worth it. I recommend walking down if you can do that, because you get some lovely views from various points on the stair case on the way down.","Written September 2, 2014"

4550,yeeehawwww,2.0,"The Seoul Tower is located on the South Mountain, and supposedly you could command a spectacular view of the Seoul skyline. The reality, however; left much to be desired.  1. the line: there was a huge line to buy tickets, and to wait for the lift, and again to come back down the mountain, mostly by local tourists and chinese tourists who come as groups or individually. a wildly popular korean drama had some scenes here, so i suppose that's the main reason for the upsurge in popularity. i came here with my girlfriend late at night, around 9PM (the lifts close at ten), hoping to avoid the crowds, but still managed to wait for over an hour all together to go up and come down. We spent no more than 15 min on the top.  2. the prices were expensive, you pay for the cable car, as well as the elevator in the tower, which is only 200 something meters, furthermore, the Seoul skyline isn't all that attractive to be honest, don't get me wrong, i love the city's youthful energy and friendly people, its just that as a city, it is nowhere near NYC, HK, Shanghai, or Paris in terms of grandeur or overall aesthetic effect on the eye. For me, it was really just a bunch of high rises in the distance and tourists and souvenir stalls next to me. So unfortunately, I was left rather disappointed by the visit.","Written August 28, 2014"
4551,Gavin_Nikicody_Lee,4.0,"(Arrival) You have to stay calm because of the crowd. I went in the evening, so did many others. The prospect of viewing Seoul's night lights seem enticing. I faced about an hour's wait to go into the lift to bring the visitors up the observatory. I don't mind the wait, but there were not enough seats or rest areas for people who were waiting. Some, just made themselves comfortable on the floor. For me, i found an air con draft and stood at the same spot for almost 1 hour. Note: If you are coming by bus, there is a steep hill for you to conquer, so advisable to have comfortable walking shoes on.  (Wait is over.. or is it...) The lift ride simulated, somewhat like a rocket taking off, with effects and all. Frankly, I din enjoy it that much because we were all packed like sardines in the lift. SO instead of going ""wow.. look at the cool effects on the ceiling of the lift.."".. I was hoping the lift ride will end ASAP.  (View from the top) The view from the observatory was great. Crowds get into your face sometimes. Some will hog the glass panels and rest themselves at the panels / selfies etc. so STAY CALM.. and wait or walk around before coming back. They have the signs that will point in the direction of you hometown, stating the distance you are away from home. There is a mailbox at the souvenir shop. Apparently, it's the 'highest' postbox or something. Many people were trying to send postcards (purchased from the shop) back home to their loved ones. Do have a pen with you if you intend on doing so.  (Final comments) Interesting experience, but my wait and travel is much longer than the time i spend there. Nice scenery but I won't be going back if i return to Seoul.","Written August 27, 2014"

Please use Shuttle Bus instead of car, because only shuttle bus and tour bus allowed to park on the tower.

We waited about 20 mins to get our tickets then queued for an extra 45 minutes just to get on the cable car up there. By this time we thought we would just give the actual tower observatory a miss and look at it from the viewing platform outside of the tower. The view was still breath taking, but I am not sure it was worth all the waiting around. A mass of tourists are up here all fighting the get the perfect picture.

Once up at the top, via a very speedy lift, we were treated to good views over Seoul. It was a clear day with no smog over the city. Unfortunately, the top is very busy a d many visitors smear their hands over the windows meaning you cannot really get good shots of the cityscape. Also, because of the huge footfall there are no comfy chairs to sit and relax up there.  The floor just below the top is less busy and for the men you can pee with a view. On this floor there is more information on the windows as to what you are looking at but again the windows are dirty.

I visited on a weekday Monday and the place was packed to the brim with tourists (chinese ones especially) and it was way too crowded to induce the romantic factor. I can't imagine what it must be like on weekends.  Even finding a space to lock your lock can be a problem. Imagine how over-packed it is! Even the red box holding the keys are almost over-flowing. When I inserted my key, I can comfortably place my hand on top of the sea of other keys! Wonder how often they empty the key box?  Anyway, the highlight of the trip was that we decided to buy an observatory and dinner package which costs 90,000 won for 2 pax. We chose Hancook Korean Restaurant for dinner and we thoroughly enjoyed it - food was delicious and we were able to order 1 main dish while the rest of it was buffet style.

4598,MagnificentSim,5.0,"Went there with my girlfriend and her family.  Walked up quite a steep maybe 1km from the train station t the cable car station. My advice is that if you're traveling with someone not as fit as you, take a bus up.  From the cable car ride, its about 2 hr or less hike to the top or take the cable car (at extra cost)  The atmosphere at the top is wonderful. Really romantic with the Love Locks. They sell them there incase you didnt bring any.  The vew from the top is great on a clear day. But its at extra cost, which i would pay for the visit. Even though it seems alittle pricy.  Once really cool thing i like inside at the top is that they have a ""post box"" where you can buy a postcard and stamps, and drop it off.  Worth another visit, i'll hike up the hill the next time, but probably may not visit the top of tower unless im with friends who havent  Cheers","Written July 3, 2014"

As an added bonus (if you are male), be sure to check out the urinals in the men's washroom. They are not usually noted for their views, but these ones are a spectacular exception.

The second I went was around Chuseok September 2012. A bit quieter since it was around the holidays, but they had traditional crafts and such. The third time I went was January 2013. It was freeezing, but there was so much to do! There was jump roping, traditional games, street artists, bands...it was amazing.  If you're in Seoul you have to come to N Seoul Tower.

I‚Äôd read about the locks in my guidebook but it simply described the sight as being ‚Äòtrees‚Äô covered with padlocks which symbolise eternal love. I knew to expect a few of these trees, but much to my surprise, I was greeted with an entire kaleidoscopic fence full of padlocks, key rings, phone cases, tags, hearts and toys - there was such an array of dazzling paraphernalia attached to the railings!  I spent nearly an hour taking in the sight before me, reading through the many names & notes appearing on the locks. Some of the messages were concise & to the point; others had a lifetime of thought & emotion put into them; all amounted to an astonishing display of collective happiness in the form of symbolic expression.  As for the view from the top of the tower? Well, it was pretty neat, but a little too smoggy to be considered spectacular. The monochrome picture from the heavens didn‚Äôt quite match the vividity of the scene below.  Promise me you visit the love locks if you ever find yourself at N Seoul Tower!

You may also take a bus or cable car to go there.  If you take a bus, you will have to walk uphill bout 10 minutes (depends). Other attractions nearby, such as Alive Museum and famous love-locks place are worth visiting if you have extra time to spend. You'll have to buy the ticket before proceeds to observation deck.  Basic costs: Heart love-lock set: KRW12000 (split two with my friend so KRW6000 each) Seoul morning tour bus: KRW10000 (you may hop in and off at most Seoul's attractions until 7 pm) Admission ticket for adult: approx. KRW15000 (observatory deck + Alive Museum) Sending postcard from observation deck: approx. KRW1000++ with stamp  It's such a nice place for photo sessions (despite it was really windy when we went there). The love-lock thing is so fun to do, and the view of Seoul from observation deck is just mesmerizing. I heard it is much fun at night, but I prefer morning as the view is clearer. Nothing to brag bout Alive Museum, just skip it if you dislike taking pictures. You need to come here if you're in Seoul, the air, the nature is amazing!","Written May 31, 2014"

So, it's better to go there at the end of the day, get a cup of coffee and enjoy views of night Seoul.

The view is nice, I admit, but you don't even need to go to the top of the tower for the view. The prices are also outrageous. This is to be expected, considering as how touristy it is, but it's not worth it.  You will pay about $9 per person just to go up the tower. Of course, you have to get to the tower first, which can vary in price and time, depending on if you take a bus, the (expensive) lift system or walk the whole way (not recommended unless you have a lot of time in Seoul). The food at the top is also expensive, so eat in advance, or bring snacks during your time at the tower.  I recommend taking a hike on one of the mountains in Seoul instead. It is a great way to get some exercise, spend some time with your friends or family, and the view is much better. Trust me. You will appreciate the scenery much more on the mountains.

I've been a lot of tower though but this one is exceptional. You may have also noticed here that there is area for lovers, which you can put and lock a lock in the tree which signifies that you and you lover is lock together forever. You may also find chairs that is inclined in 2 ends that when people sits there, they will eventually move closer to each other in the center. It was weekend when we visit that's why there's a lot of people and unfortunately, we weren't able to go up the tower but even if we were just at the base.

It may not be as spectacular as the cable but as we were a family of 4, it was definitely MUCH cheaper and faster than walking. Take into consideration the traffic in the late afternoon as the bus does take over 30 minutes to get up there. We were hoping to arrive to watch the sunset but made it a little after but the sky over the city was still brilliant. Try to go on a clear day as the visibility will obviously be better.There are plenty of photo opportunities just as you get off the bus and many more as you walk up to the entrance of the tower. There are great views from on top of the hill and if you are on a budget that may be enough. However, I recommend the 360 view from the observatory at the top of the tower as it is stunning.

4662,FancyFree55,4.0,"We couldn't help but spot the tower during the taxi ride to our hotel in Namsan, so of course we had to check it out. We've been to the towers in Seattle and Toronto, as well as to the Eiffel Tower, so our expectations were high.  You take an elevator to the observation deck, and there wasn't any wait on a Sunday late afternoon. The ride up is kind of hokey ... the elevator operator uses a remote control to simulate taking off in a spacecraft via a video on the ceiling. I prefer the windowed elevator in Toronto's tower where you can get a glimpse outside while you climb higher and higher.  Though it was a dismal rainy day, the views were still beautiful 360 degrees. As night falls, and the city lights up, the views become more stunning.  We got a kick out of reading on each window the direction and distance listed to a particular city somewhere in the world, such as Anchorage, Alaska or Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Or the North Pole.  You can buy bulk candy and souvenirs and photos, including having your photo imprinted on a souvenir mug. It's significant that you can send a love letter postmarked from the post office at the top of the tower, which has something to do with a Korean movie about a couple who fell in love here.  Regular adult admission is surprisingly inexpensive at 9000 won (about $9 US), and you can get a senior discount if you're 65 plus - 7000 won.  We waited in line for the trip back down at what we thought was the elevator. It turned out we were waiting in line for entry to a Korean restaurant, so we wasted ten minutes there before we found the right line. There is no signeage marking the exit route.  Other than missing the exit, we had no problems going up or coming down and we greatly enjoyed the views. You can't beat this vantage point for seeing the grandeur of Seoul.","Written April 27, 2014"

We waited for nearly 50 mins before we were able to board the elevator up. We were there at night and the view was alright. Having been to other attractions such as Marina Bay Sands & Taipei 101, the view was pretty disappointing as compared to them. We thought the worst of the queueing was over but we still had to queue to get down to the main lobby.

Price is 6k won one way, 8k won return and 8.5k won roundtrip. the cable car ride is not that long and when you are stuck in the middle when the car is full, you wont be able to take any photo. its not needed though because the view up is way better so you dont have to feel bad. if you dont want to take the cable car, you can trek using the stairs going up. view inside the tower and outside is just the same but if you like to enter the tower, there is a separate fee that you need to pay (9k won). My advice, dont enter the tower anymore. its cramped with people and the view is just the same. there are restaurants and cafes in the area. price range from 8k won for coffee americano and pancake. best to go here before sunset so you get to experience the view with daylight and diamond like little lights of the city at night. going back, they said there is a bus that you can take but we didnt see it that time so we needed to take the cab. Cab fee is fixed from that place, orange cab is 20k won and black cab is 30k won. not sure how far they can take you but we were headed to myeong dong and that was the rate.","Written March 16, 2014"

Queued for about 1.5 hours before even making the cable car flight, in a waiting room crammed full of tourists, and little ventilation. The room was filthy, with people dropping their trash all over the place, and no-one cleaning it up. Not ideal, but we dealt.  When we eventually made it to the tower foyer and the top of the hill, we were presented with a further wait whilst we waited our turn to ascend the tower itself.  After our expedition to the top, we were quite disappointed. The windows were really dirty, which made photographs, and the general view, pretty poor. There were no outside viewing areas, and they really pile the punters into this tower, so there's very little room for manoeuvre. There's also a pick'n'mix candy store which is just absolutely ridiculous.

The area is clean and the views are nice, and we certainly enjoyed the long walk their from our hotel. Inside however, you are hit by the 'candy sweet' smell of popcorn while queueing for your ticket. Their are different options available, and since we were there at lunch we opted for the 'couples package' which included trips to the viewing deck (for two people, despite the board saying one person only) and lunch in their 'Italian' restaurant. Once inside the lift you are told to look up where, on the lift ceiling, they play a techno high speed video that you can't focus on and if anything made us both feel weird as the elevator was ascending. Then once inside the place is full of 'pick and mix' sweets and crap for kids. How someone has suggested that the attraction was suited to couples is beyond me. The restaurant was the biggest let down. We were greeted and seated in an awful spot with a huge vent blocking the view (the restaurant was 99% empty at the time). Then, with virtually no English (unlike most people we met in Korea who speak quite good English) we were offered only two pasta plates, carbonara or arrabiato, neither of which we wanted. This was also to share - NOT a plate each! This hugely limited choice, given such a varied menu, was never indicated at the ticket office. It also did not include any drinks which, you guessed it, cost the earth compared to normal places. The food when it arrived was then totally different. We had a smoked salmon salad which may have been nice be it for the gallon of dressing covering everything - the pasta was well cooked but ruined by streaky bacon, and also a margarita pizza was served but the base was literally thinner than a crepe!  The views from the base surrounding the tower are just as good as inside. I would recommend the walk and to visit the various viewing points...

They even have a couple package ticket, slightly costly but you get a popcorn and two drinks.  There's elevator which took us to the observation deck. It's indeed a couple place, other than the typical tourists group, all you can see are local couples, and couple travelers like us. People will just sit by the window, and talk and talk for the whole night. That's what we did.  We even sent a postcard from the tower, which is the highest post office in Seoul. Haha! I received the postcard in good order after two weeks. So please feel free to send one too.  We've also secured a love lock near the ticketing counter. I guess is a must do for couples.

I wanted to walk up even though it was -5 so got to Myeong-dong station on the light blue line and walked out of exit 3 and headed towards the mountain. It was really easy to find- you can't miss a mountain. I read a review that said it was 20 mins walk - no way! From the station it was over an hour of walking up but there are stairs and clear paved paths all the way. It's a decent walk but not too hectic - young kids were doing it. Somewhere in the first half hour there is an outdoor free-weight gym on the side of the path. Cars can drive most of the way and were parked next to the gym and it was manned by an old Korean man who was exercising. It was so amazing to see this random sight. After the rest of the walk you come to the top and there are restaurants, convenience stores where I re-hydrated.

We start the trip at 7 PM, we took a bus (Blue bus no. 406) from Namdaemun market and alight at Namsan tower tunnel 3 (2 stops). We walk accross the street throuh tunnel heading to Namsan Oreumi (The elevator). It located right beside the street, and bring us to Namsan Cable car. We buy ticket for round trip, and it costs 8000 won. It's a bit pricey. When we arrived at N Seoul Tower we still have to walk through the stairs. But it' worth it. The view of Seoul was great. At the corner there is padlock tree. We bought one at the souvenir store and lock it there. It's memorable time since my wife really love K-drama.

It really depends when you go. I took the cable car at night around 8pm, i didn't need to wait that long. I think maybe around 10~15mins time. The cable car is a bit pricey i thought but its an experience and most tourist will never know until they took it. Alternatively, you can take the bus there at a much lower cost.  I think one of the attractions was the safe/lock thing where many couples, friends and family (me included) purchased a lock and lock there. Of course some would say its not worth it and stuff like that but what I can tell you is that it really depends what your looking for. For me, i do it as an experience and memory so i think its worth it. Even if you don't purchase a lock and lock it there, its an experience to see how many people visited Seoul.

The old wall and watchtowers for lighting fires to warn of the approach of enemies is interesting. There is usually a small wait, I suspect not due to crowds but an attempt to increase browsing in the stores at the base of the tower. Once you get to the top the view is fantastic on a clear day. There are restaurants if you want to dine while enjoying the view. The food is pricey and not very good because you are paying for the view, not the food. The Korean menu is translated but they usually use a literal translation which can make it unappealing to foreigners. Kolbany is translated as ""pond snails"" instead of escargot, tripe is identified as ""pig intestines"". They might sell more food if they translated better.

There are many different ways you can get to the Observation Platform and we walked from our hotel to the Oreumi glass elevator that took us to the cable car. The Oreumi elevator is an outdoor elevator that is right in front of the Namsan Tunnel and takes you to the Cable Car. The Cable car ride is not a long one and you have to hike quite a number of steps after you get dropped off by the cable car to get to the observation platform. There is a burger place and a souvenir shop if you want to grab something to eat and get home some memento.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a whole lot of love locks here.

From the city, we had to walk uphill and it was quite long just to reach the cable car docking station. The fee of one way going up is 6000 won per person. It brought us only up to a certain point then we had to walk steep uphill to reach the summit. When we went there it was evening. Since one of my passion is photography, I brought along my tripod together with my camera gears. There's a fee again of 9000 won if you want to reach the observation deck where lots of shops were set up. It was frustrating in a sense because it was not an open space. So I had to take pictures through the glass where at some parts there are reflections. On our way down, it was a good thing we took the bus all the way to meongdong.

Spent may be five minutes at the top; the lines to the elevator, even during this off season weekday, were long, and it was getting quite stuffy in the area.

Along the walk you can find some tasty snacks to keep you moving like corndogs, silk worm larvae and other finger foods. Make sure to get some videos of kids playing the Korean version of ""rock-paper-scissors"" as they come down from the top.

4861,TCKinFC,3.0,"So, this wasn't really high on my priority list of ""to see"" in Seoul but went there we did. It was a very foggy day with poor visibility so I don't know why we bothered. We took the cable ride up .... tiny cable cars btw. They pack you all in so tight that it's hard to get a good panoramic view of the city. You can also walk up the hill if you're up for the challenge and want a good work out; which would be fine with me but not when we had an 8.5 & 4 yr olds with us. The grounds surrounding the base of N Tower is beautiful and serene. That would probably the best part of the site. You could bring a picnic and come hang out here and let the kids run wild. N Tower, as it turns out, has become a bit of a lovers' destination. The place to meet with potential lover, first encounter, date, and make ever lasting promise of your undying love to each other by putting a lock marked with your names and attaching it to any free space on the railings if you can find a spot. Good luck as there have been 100,000s before you! Shops and cafes at the base of the tower caters to said lovers. Even a store selling locks if you forgot to bring your own. The place is dripping with cheese. Enough to make a cold hearted, non-romantic such as myself want to hurl. All in all nothing that interesting to see but if you just want to be outdoors, near nature, and get a good exercise, this is a nice place to come.","Written August 9, 2013"

At the base of the Tower, we had several food options and I liked the whole experience out there. There was a place where many couples came to ""lock"" thier love and longetivity of their relationship. There was a live band playing over there and the Light and Sound show in the Night was worth waiting for.

Because the air conditioning was not turned on and it was summer, hence it was hot and stuffy, so we didn't stay long in the tower. So I recommend that it is not a must-do to pay quite an expensive fee to go up the tower.  However, the ground level view is good enough to get an aerial bird's eye view of the city. The air is fresh because of all the greenery and we wished we had brought food to do a picnic in the namsan park.

This is said to be a very popular couples destination as many people propose there. There is a lock tree which it is said that you can lock your love with your partner and they will never let you go. That sounds so cute, but of course not always true. There was a wall inside that has notes and letters from people who came there. The view is spectacular, they have a nice gift shop, and they do have a cafe. I would definitely suggest going here with a really close friend or your partner.

We were able to get to the top of the tower right as the sun was going down so got some amazing pictures of the sunset and then the city after dark. The only thing I didn't care for was that there was no outdoor observation deck so the only option for picture taking is through the glass windows.

There is a small park, various stores, a restaurant, and other novelties. The day was somewhat foggy so we opted to stay at the base. However, you can go further up the tower but need to pay yet another fee. The view from the base was OK. An hour or so walking around at this level should be enough.

Before going to Seoul I hadn't heard about the locks. It is definitely a great date spot. I also visited the Teddy Bear Museum which wasn't quite what I expected but was still a great pit stop. I highly recommend going up onto one of the observation decks to get the full experience. You can buy a ticket to the general observation deck and then once there you can buy a ticket to a higher observation deck. Going on a clear day would allow for the best viewing. There is also an area where you can buy a postcard and send mail off from the observation deck.

The placing of city names in other countries such as New Zealand, Australia, across other windows gave us a sense of direction. It costs about 9000 won each to go up the tower and if you wonder why a double ticket costs more than two single tickets, it's because it includes a big bucket of popcorn!

Among the attractions there were a) the thousands of locks which represented eternal love. There were several benches which were bent as if an extremely heavy person has sat on it. b) the signage of the geographical center of Seoul if I am not mistaken c) a small temple-like structure which was great for photo-takings. We could also see the city of Seoul although the view was not that clear due to the hazy conditions. We didnt go up the tower because of the time constraint.

4924,eIeven11,4.0,"I didn't take a ticket to go up to the observatory however the view is nice from the around the tower with lots of things to see. I find to enjoy this experience is to walk up from the bottom of the road instead of taking the cable car or the bus. The walk is about 1 hour and so nice along the winding road, which is mostly shaded. Lots of people walking their dogs, jogging, and just enjoying the day out. Food and drink is expensive when you reach the top ( 5 dollars for an ice cream ) so you may want to pack some things in your day pack before you go,water etc. It was nice to see Seoul from this point.","Written May 25, 2013"
4925,Kidkong,5.0,"This spot is somewhat outstanding for a vacation spot in Seoul. To get a grasp for a city that is constantly growing in size you can go to N Seoul Tower and take a look around and see the whole city of Seoul. On a clear day you can see the city carved out of the mountains.  There is also a clever saying that you can buy a lock for you and your sweet heart on the chain fence with two keys. Each member of the couple has a key so if you break up you can go remove your lock if you can find it!! (they do cut off some of the crazier locks and trim the locks down now and then)  You could also buy a tile and put it on the wall with a message, but all the messages are removed after New Years.  There is a tram that goes to the top, but walking and looking at the sketch artists or occasional performance groups is enjoyable as well.","Written May 24, 2013"

4930,danjumbuck,4.0,"Often in a new city, I do take the effort to visit towers or tall buildings with observation decks given my line of work. I don't often enjoy them given how most of these visits are often crammed full with tourists, usually over-priced, and due to the nature of having to move vertically - you have to endure packed elevators on top of the lines. Still, I do make the effort if I have the time and there are the occasional highlights - plus some cities really look so much better from up high.  The N Seoul Tower in Seoul, South Korea is definitely one of the pluses in my book. Although in terms of infrastructure there really isn't anything remarkably different about the N Seoul Tower, I definitely enjoyed my visit there and count it as among the highlights of my week long Seoul adventure.  One of the major attractions of the N Seoul Tower is its location atop the scenic Namsan mountain in the centre of the city. The tower is fringed by nature and the absence of cars gives the space a certain serenity that's marred only by the shuttle buses that ply the route up. It's definitely worthwhile making your way here just to enjoy the view from the base of the tower, soaking in nature's splendour and enjoying an ice cream from one of the many retailers here. I was here in Spring so the weather was crisp, cool and really almost perfect.  The N Seoul Tower has a unique positioning as the place for love with many love-smitten folks hanging padlocks declaring their everlasting bonds on structures and fences at the base. It makes for some pretty ornaments (albeit expensive ones) but really, this notion of public testaments of love seems pretty tacky. Plus the whole idea of a padlock reminds me more of a prison than love but hey, that's my opinion entirely.  The good thing about the 'love connection' here at the tower is that it lends the whole space a whole lot more charm and appeal. And the management of the place obviously knows this and uses this to their benefit well what with couple benches and love-themed souvenirs. Towers and tall buildings can be sterile and industrial so this lovey-dovey angle is really a compelling angle to have.  As compelling as the site is, the star of course is the tower itself. The N Seoul Tower has a few observatory levels including two restaurants. I only did the views so can't comment on the dining options up high. Tickets are not as pricy as some other towers starting at around RM24 (USD8) which is really pretty decent. There's a combo ticket option which gives you entry to the Teddy Bear Museum also located onsite which I highly recommend.  The tower visit itself is fairly generic. You have a fancy elevator ride up that's decked out with multimedia (this time on the elevator roof). The observatory levels offer great views and there are retail outlets too offering gifts and snacks. One nice addition is the opportunity to send a postcard overseas from the little 'postal office' there. I also liked how they indicated the distance to other major Asian cities on the glass windows based on the direction you are facing. I can see many tourists looking for 'home' and I did too.  So if you ever find yourself in Seoul, do check out the N Seoul Tower. If you do a relaxed visit with a meal, the Teddy Bear Museum and a walk around the site thrown in, it's a good half day at least. Check out the main website for access information and hours and I've heard that the night view is stunning. Definitely a site I will recommend.","Written May 19, 2013"

We stopped for a break at a snack stall on the way up. By the time we go there, we were pretty exhausted but enjoyed the night view of Seoul city nonetheless.  The only attraction of Seoul Tower is the panoramic view of the city.

It's good enough for you to stay at the base of the tower, and the open air environment feels nice at night. Nothing much to do though, aside from eating or looking at the view.  The top of the tower is a bit so-so. It's not that significantly higher imo. You don't get to feel the height either as there are no glass floors for you to look down.

As the sun sets, you will see different hue in the sky along the way up. Also there is a good view point to see Seoul below you.  Currently there is a light show projected onto the tower.

The weather wasn't perfect, but we still went up to the Seoul Tower for a higher view. We took the elevator up and were taken by surprise with the motion-graphics display inside the lift. It made us feel like astronauts traveling in a space shuttle into the galaxy. At the observatory, we were disappointed with the 360‚Å∞ view due to the fog.

4952,MichaelE-England,3.0,"You have to be extremely determined to get to the top of this tower. There‚Äôs no quick and easy way. A city tour bus stops here ‚Äì the hop on hop off type. Local buses venture up, and my guide book says that taxis carrying foreign tourists can drive up. There‚Äôs also a cable car but that‚Äôs no quick and easy trip either. The base of the cable car has no nearby metro and it‚Äôs a climb just to get there. On my way down I did see some shuttle buses but as a tourist, good look with finding out where they go to. There‚Äôs a rail car which covers part of the way from the base station to the street level.  Anyway, back to the tower. When you get off your bus, you‚Äôre still faced with a steep climb to the tower. Fatties beware. You buy your ticket then you look round for signs where to go and see none, so naturally you head to the base of the tower and inside you do a complete circuit past numerous cafes etc and see a lift. Then you‚Äôre told that this is not the lift up. The man points to a public phone across a pathway outside and a small alleyway behind it. You look for the signs and still see none. Not any in English anyway. The pathway leads you in to a building with various entertainments and you still find yourself looking around and having to ask where the lift is. Eventually, at some point in your life, you get to the top of the tower.  The view is ok. During my 9 day stay I went up on what was probably the clearest sunniest day and it was still very hazy. There were no distant views to be enjoyed. As always, I venture up these towers mid to late afternoon for daytime photos and stay until after dark for night shots. Seoul didn‚Äôt really come to life and light up very much. Not like say Hong Kong, Tokyo, Shanghai and Sydney. It was disappointing. From a photographic point of view, the cleanliness of the windows was good.  Now the descent. I chose to use the cable car. By the time you‚Äôve walked down the multitude of steps to discover the huge queue, you‚Äôre unlikely to feel like climbing all the way back up to get a bus down. So you join the queue and during that time you‚Äôre expecting to come across a ticket booth, or pay on entry thing. Not quite. By the time you get to a point close to boarding you see that almost everybody has already got a ticket by some means, Your option is to exit the queue and buy a ticket form the vending machine at point of boarding. While you are trying to work out how to use the non-English machine, 50 people who were behind you are now in front and filling up that single slow-moving cable car. If you‚Äôre quick and lucky you just manage to get in that car as I did without having to wait 10 minutes for the next one.  At the base station it‚Äôs a case of wandering around and deciding on the options. You‚Äôre still fairly high up. There are steps down to street level, and as mentioned earlier, a rail car. Some of the non-English speaking tourists found a bay with shuttle buses, went to investigate, then returned to the rail car where I was, having been unable to find out which buses went where. Once you‚Äôre back on the street it‚Äôs about a 20 minute walk to a metro station. And you‚Äôre still going downhill.  So, as I said at the beginning, you have to be extremely determined to venture up this tower.","Written April 25, 2013"

You will still need to climb some steps to get to the entrance and first viewing platform. The attraction is exceptionally well laid out and ticket purchasing was uncomplicated and smooth. We then took the skylift to the beacon viewing platform ... It really is an amazing sight, the full 360 degrees of a vast and colourful city. From each window you are reminded of what lies beyond by capital city names and distances printed in large lettering, gives a wonderful appreciation of where you are in the world in relation to the globe. There are a lot of shopping opportunities on this level and all budgets are catered for from postcards right up to huge stuffed animals. We took our time before dropping back down to the lower level where you can eat or grab a coffee. Here they have two interesting features; a wall which houses small ceramic tiles purchased by couples or families and inscribed with love notes or photos and then placed on the wall; and outdoors 6 amazing metal trees laden down with padlocks which we understood were pledges or love tokens also. Have to be seen to be believed. Cute and commercial at the same time, essential Korea! When we were finished we chose to walk back down but had no idea which direction to take so we just set off! It took about 30 minutes to reach ground level and we 'landed' at the university side of the city. It was very pretty with strings of coloured paper lanterns hanging along the university perimeter.

Was totally out of breath when we reached the station! The best way to get there is by taxi as it won't cost a lot. It will save you a lot of leg power. If you really want to walk, we found out too late there is a much easier way. I don't have the road names ready but I will try to give adequate directions. From Myeondong shopping are, head towards Migliore dept store and turn right on the main road. Think is is called Namsan-dong. Walk towards Shinsaegae dept store (near Namdaemun market). Before reaching Shinsaegae, turn left (a big road so you can't miss it). Walk on for 5 minutes (uphill) and you will come to a lift (special lift just to bring passengers up to Namsan Cable car station. It is free and is so easy rather than walking uphill like what we did...at the cable car station, a return ticket is KRW8,000 per pax. Need a 10 min wait for each cable car to arrive. It was worth the wait as we got down at the foot of N-Seoul Tower. Plenty of activities as there were some shows going on, changing of guards? Can take pictures with the guards. After a few flight of steps, you will be at the big courtyard where you can buy tickets up to the observatory deck or go into the restaurants in the tower. We wondered around the open areas and were fascinated with the many colourful locks (for sweethearts) and couple seats...you need to see this and try it out...cool. The shops on the ground floor are so pretty and captivating that we forgot all about going up the observatory deck (KRW9,000 entrance fees) and shopped there for nearly 45 minutes, choosing all the cute stuff sold there. All in all, it was worth our while albeit the tough walk.","Written April 3, 2013"

Someone was creative enough to show a video on the ceiling of the elevator so no one gets bored waiting for the inevitable ding to happen. It`s best to go when it`s a clear night. It gives such a spectacular view of the city. There are several attractions you will find at the tower. What you will notice is that almost all of it has ""love"" themes. N Tower is apparently considered a date place by locals. That would explain the love notes at the lower level of the observation deck and the ""love locks"" at the bottom of the tower. I thought it was cute. It`s still very family-oriented, though. You can still visit with friends or solo, but be prepared for the abundance of couples.","Written March 18, 2013"

We parked our car in the Arts Theatre car park and caught the bus up to the tower. It cost us 1,900 Won for the bus for two adults and one elementary school age child.  Be warned, the way up to the base of the tower is steep and there is no other way to access it once the bus drops you at the stop for the tower.  You can buy magnetic tiles and write love messages to stick on the wall on the level below the observation deck. This deck is really no different to any other one I have been in before with labels of countries on the windows with the distance from the tower.  We chose to dine in the Hancook restaurant which was Korean buffet, two levels below the observation deck. It was relatively pricey for what it was but if you enjoy Korean cuisine and panoramic views, it's worth it.  The only downfall is the loop bus back to our car unfortunately did a loop of the whole city before dropping us back at our car. We didn't mind as its a way to see the city and know where things are for our next visit to Seoul but if you needed to get back in a hurry, I would allow an extra half hour to get back to your car unless you planned to walk back down the mountain.  An attraction I would definitely come back to even knowing that I will have to climb that steep hill again.  Note: the lifts for the observation deck are down some stairs from where you purchase tickets. The Hancook Restautant can only be accessed via stairs down from the observation deck. The lifts to return down to the base of the tower is one level down from the observation deck via stairs.","Written March 2, 2013"

4987,Jaymee0511,4.0,"Going to the cable cars to go up to the N Seoul Tower was not an easy walk. It was quite a distance from the Myeongdong station, and it was an uphill climb to the cable car building. It is another climb (stairs) to the tower. It is, however, a nice place to go to especially if you‚Äôre a fan of Korean dramas, because both the cable cars and the N Seoul tower itself are frequently featured in them (Boys Over Flowers, Rooftop Prince, Can't Lose, etc). The lights/video show were nice to watch in N Seoul, where they projected videos on the tower itself, making it look like the tower was unraveling, spiraling, among other effects. With the tower on top of a mountain, it gives a fantastic view of busy, beautiful Seoul.  In the N Seoul Tower you can go to the Teddy Bear museum, which is essentially Korea‚Äôs history told through tableau /dioramas made of cute teddy bears. Again if you‚Äôre a fan of Korean dramas, and have watched Goong, in the Teddy Bear museum you‚Äôll see Alfred, the teddy bear of the Prince Shin Goon, along with the other bears featured in the drama.","Written February 26, 2013"

When we arrived at the top of the hill where the tower is, we thought we have to wait for long but even there's a lot of people it goes so smooth that it only took us 10 mins. In the line for the elevator to go up. The elevator was so cool and when we got to the top the view was breath taking, it's like a gold that shines so bright and the glass of the tower has the direction and name of every countries that we found interesting and looked for our country to take a picture. The souvenirs and photos are kinda expensive but the view are awesome. When you go to Seoul this is the place to visit even just once.","Written December 12, 2012"

It is surrounded by greenery rather than other buildings/skyscrapers. I went up the cable just before sunset and left right after sunset so I got the best of both worlds in terms of taking pictures during the day vs night. There is the option to go up the observatory, but the locals were telling me that you can get great shots just by staying at the base. On a nice day, you can get a good workout by hiking up instead of taking the cable car!","Written December 11, 2012"

5056,kakos_theo,4.0,"Getting to the Seoul Tower is something of an adventure in itself - I had no problem following the online directions to take the subway stop and walk through the commercial district past restaurants and things and take some stairs and walk along the street to the cable car, which was an interesting trip in itself. You can also get there by bus which would be preferable if you have a problem with heights.  Once the cable car lets you off, up on the mountain, you could walk over to the tower itself or you could explore the mountain, which has a big park and an outdoor pavilion area where they were doing some kind of cultural display when I was there, and who knows what else. There are also food vendors, coffee, and other stuff like that.  So far you could do all this for free, because you can just hike up the mountain if you want, and once there you don't have to pay for anything else unless you want to experience the observation decks or the restaurant in the tower itself. We decided to go ahead and pay to go up to the observation deck, because it doesn't really cost that much and it was a weekday so it wasn't very crowded. We didn't have to wait in line for anything, and we were able to easily take advantage of the bathrooms (which have amazing views and are very clean and nice) and the coffee shop and restaurant and so on that are on the observation levels. One thing we found out is that the restaurant is on a rotating level but the observation level does not rotate, so you can't just sit there and see the entire city like I thought I was going to do.  In summary, the views are amazing and definitely worth it even on a hazy day. Yes it can get a little touristy in there, and yes the prices at the coffee shop and so on are quite high, but it is a tourist attraction after all. I considered it to be worth the price of admission. I plan on going back on a clear day if possible to eat at the rotating restaurant just so I can enjoy the view of the whole city.","Written November 30, 2012"

Cable-car is stable even though it's packed with people.  The view from the top is nice :) Quite similar to what we've seen in Taipei 101. Walk a few rounds and came down.  There's a lovers' locker just ouside of the gift shop. After you purchase your locks and keys, walk out of the gift shop and you'll see some stairs.

If you are a teddy bear lover, you will surely love the museum! It actually tells you some history of Korea, but if you're not a history person the bears can really keep you entertain too! You will have to go through the museum I and II first before going up to the observatory.  As for the observatory, it's a pretty nice experience going up the lift and watching this video effect. View from the observatory is really good, and you can send out post card from the high tower. I visited during the sunset, so it's really nice and if you hang around for a while more you can see the night scene too.

You'd be hard pressed to find a lovelier urban setting than Seoul. So it's a special treat to view that from high above.  Most guests will arrive at the base of the Tower on the tram. So bear in mind that you'd need to pay the tram fee and the Tower entrance fee. For people in decent shape, I suggest paying only for the one-way tram fee since the walk down is easy and picturesque.  Even if you don't decide to go up the Tower, the base provides magnificent views. It's hard not to get a tad emotional at the beauty of the area.

To get to the tower, you take a very cool cable car up a beautiful mountain (especially nice in spring or fall) and at the top there are normally traditional Korean dancers or performers. From there, there are a few (slightly overpriced) restaurants and shops and the entrance to the tower itself. From the top of the tower, you can see the whole city. It is a great view. Additionally, there is a tradition at the Seoul Tower that you and your honey write your names on a lock (like a padlock) and attach it to a big area of fence.

5142,Ades2312,5.0,"I went here twice in a row for the past two years every time I visit Seoul. I came here during winter so it's really no big deal to walk that high to reach the N-tower. Yes, from the bus stop, we need to walk pretty high to reach the are. There's no ladder whatsoever, so we have to, well literally climb, the hill. I'm sure my friends whom I've brought here lose their breath every 100meters. Hahaha. Just make sure you know that there's a pretty sloppy road to reach the tower.  To reach N-tower you can use the gondola from Myeongdong, which is pretty expensive, or you can go by bus from nearest area downtown. I stopped at Konkuk uni, and wait for the bus number 2,3,or 5 to go to N-tower. Going by bus is really nice, since you can experience how crazy Korean bus drivers are. Their driving skill is really scary! If you go by bus, make sure you take a seat. I don't really recommend you standing on a Korean bus though.  I am not really into a gondola for a city view, so I better save that money for riding gondola at Seorak Mountain. Anyway, you have to go to N-tower in the evening. Around 4 pm maybe then you can arrive there around 5 or 6, and you can see an illuminated Seoul. It's really beautiful.  I can't say that there's nothing you can do here. I always spent like 3-4 hours here. My friends like to see what's written in the locks. There's a lot of steel trees with locks. People say you can write your wish on the lock and put the lock on the tree then your wish may come true. Well, at least mine. We love to take pictures here, it's really like photographers' site though.  There's also a restaurant at the top of the tower, and several other restaurants with nice views at the ground floor. We can enjoy the view while having dinner. Then there's several souvenir shops which are hard to miss on. They sell various nice stuffs with N-tower emboss. The price is not very expensive too. If you are lucky perhaps you can find something even more cheaper than the one in Namdaemun.  In N-tower, there's a teddy bear museum. I only went here once. Practically showing Korean history throughout centuries but using teddy bear as the diorama. Cute place, you can take pictures too inside. The price is pretty expensive, but if you are not planning to go to Jeju island, it's better you go to this place. Yes, there's also one teddy bear museum in Jeju island as one of Jeju's main attraction.  To go inside N-tower, you don't need an entrance fee. But to go to the top of the tower, and to go inside teddy bear museum, yes, you need an entrance fee. Any choice is up to you and I don't think money is really a matter for such experience.","Written July 29, 2012"

Be prepared to wait in line for the cable car if you don't want to walk all the way to the top.

Also, be sure to bring a padlock and add it to the walls and installations featuring padlocks with messages and wishes written on them.  We planned on only visiting the tower, but once we were there and looking out across the city and below, we regretted not exploring Namsan Park as well. Best way to get up to the tower is by the Namsan Cable Car or if you want to spend the whole day at the huge park (which I would love to do next time), you can take a hike up.

At the top, we found thousands of ""locks"" attached to each other and to a boundary wall of an observation deck. My memory flashed to an episode of ""The Amazing Race"" and I recalled the contestants receiving a key and having to discover a single lock among these tens of thousands that fit. That was a fun bit of connection. This is a popular location and can be accessed via the walk up, or there is a cable car. The tower is immense and at night its curved sides are used as screens for a multitude of projectors that bring video scenes to life, changing the tower's colors, using different patterns, etc. We went up to the observation deck and had dinner at a Korean buffet restaurant. We stayed here until dark and watched the lights of Seoul begin to shimmer and shine through the smoggy atmosphere. This was the brightest and most attractive the city appeared during our whole visit. (The men's restroom atop the observation deck has huge plate glass windows as walls looking out over the city. The urinals are placed here so that as you relieve yourself you are looking out over the cityscape. Very odd sensation!) The only hitch is leaving the observation deck level, as a line forms for the elevators but it moves quickly and soon you are at the tower base and must decide how to get back off the hill. We opted for a bus over another long stair way and got out at the subway station and quickly found our way to our lodgings.","Written July 5, 2012"

Trust us to make our own decisions. The locks and hearts of couples was fun and the park at the base a nice place to spend a cool couple of hours. Go early enough (5-6pm ish)so lines are less for the dark night sky viewing. Large steps up and down, from cable care to park base, so workin the calf muscles and the knees. Be careful.

I took the bus both times, so I suppose I would try walking the foot path or cable car if i ever went again. The bus was fine. I recommend going in the late after noon when you can see the view of the city by day. You can then stay and enjoy a snack in the cafe and watch the sunset. You will be treated to an entirely different scene when you see the city light up for the evening. Go with someone who isn't in a rush, and who will appreciate the scenery with you. This is definitely worth doing once if you are in Korea for a year or more. Please be aware that there is an additional cost to go up to the viewing levels of the tower. Some friends had paid to take the cable car up to the tower grounds, but they then realized they had to by the additional cost to take the elevator up inside the tower. In my opinion, if you go all the way there, you have to go up inside the tower. The cost, whatever it was, did not seem much to me and was worth it.

The conventional way to get up the mountain is to take the cable car shuttle to the tower. You can pay the fare with the same card you use to pay the subway fare. The trouble was, the cable car station is difficult to find, especially since we were not local. Also, cars are not allowed up to the tower, so we couldn't hail a cab. That day, due to strong winds, the cable car service was temporarily suspended. So we had to take a bus shuttle service up the mountain to the tower. Mind you, we had to stand the whole ride up the winding mountain road. It wasn't very pleasant.We were also really hungry by this time because we thought we could have dinner on the tower. When we reached the final bus stop we still had to walk a long way up the mountain (steep roads).  Unfortunately, we didn't anticipate that there would be SO many couples. Cue many smooching couples/couples holding hands. We felt a little awkward but since we had our own company it wasn't too bad.  We chose not to visit the Teddy Bear Museum as we felt it wasn't value for our money.  Despite all my troubles, it is still worth a visit for the panoramic view of Seoul. On a good day, it offers a really good view and it is very romantic for couples.","Written June 22, 2012"

5190,fanny n,4.0,we visited during the night to watch the city skyline during night time. the free transport shuttle bus from myeongdong can be very crowded but it's worth the shot. the elevator going up to the cable car station can be full during the night time as well. we were surprised to know that there's a light show that night! an extra bonus for our N Seoul Tower visit!,"Written May 5, 2012"

5192,Lian T,3.0,"The climb up to the N Seoul Tower is a pleasant ascent through nice gardens in Nasam Park. It is a bit steep at times but not overly strenuous. Once at the Tower there are a few other things to see within the grounds including the ""Locks of Love"", which I thought was better than the view! It's a very cool site to see, all the locks and messages of love, attached to the railings. The view from the top of the tower was nice and they point out the direction and distance to other major cities! It's a good place to come on a clear day!","Written May 4, 2012"
5193,HangGabbie,5.0,"It's a ""must visit"" place in Seoul! You can have panorama view of the city, enjoy the pure, natural atmosphere and share wonderful moments with your lovers locking your love locks. I've been here 3 times and I have a love lock here hihi","Written May 3, 2012"

5202,virstud,3.0,"I have been to this tower twice, the second time is with my family. We took the bus to get to the place and the walk from the bus terminals to the tower is exhilarating but very nice experience. The discount coupon I got from the T-money Plus card is not applicable if you get the combo teddy bear musuem and the N-Seoul tower package.  The place is a tourist trap, everything is expensive including the limited choices of food shops.","Written April 22, 2012"
5203,pyanbest,3.0,"Nothing much to do here unless you're teenager madly in love. It was cold and cloudy whe I visited. Still, the view was nice. Other than that, you can skip this one.","Written April 20, 2012"

5205,smr85,3.0,"when I visit here there is no cherry blossoms yet around this place so it look like a average park, I think it should be better with the Cherry Blossoms. this place would be more beautiful.","Written April 19, 2012"
5206,icespring,4.0,"It gives a beautiful view of the city. It is best if you could visit just before sunset so you could see the city at day and night. I think this is also best for couples since they got to hang their love locks and write down love devotions on wooden blocks left on the wall there,besides dropping off love letters to the highest post office in Seoul. There are also cafes inside where you can eat. And of course, the teddy bear museum is fun!","Written April 18, 2012"
