417,417,5.0,This is a must see building in Dongdaemun It looks like a space ship at night with glistering lights all around The inside is white with curves and angles on the stairways that are pleasing to the eyes There was an art exhibition on the ground floor and interesting design items for sale when I was there in the beginining of Feburary There are two cafeterias that I can see on the top floor They even have a piano outside around the middle entrance under cover for passerbys to display their talents You can easily spend half a day there if you are into art and design,1

421,421,5.0,I find the night view of this beautiful and serene amongst the hustle and bustle of the city Its a modern walk thru the garden where you will find lit roses and standalone pianos to be played by any passers by which can be heard from most parts of the spot In the day you can do more with the design labs art halls and others alike,1
