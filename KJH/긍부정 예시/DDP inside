397,397,2.0,We arent only to find out there were no exhibits Literally zero things to look at inside Its a nice enough building but we were expecting to see actual design work inside only to discover they were between exhibits have no permanent collections and most people went for the market out front and the childrens playland on the top floor It was very disappointing Would highly recommend finding out if theres actually something to look at before you go else just stop by if its on your way to someplace else Not worth it to go to Dongdaemun just to look at an empty building,0
623,623,2.0,While the building on the outside was pretty cool there was little happening with the actually space There was no reason to even go inside it  a quick walk around on the outside is all its worth,0
576,576,2.0,Soooooo boring Dont know Some people like the building but inside nothing interesting Only few expencive shops Was glad to see a good shopping center nearby so it made the way there not so useless ,0
604,604,2.0,The building and the history points on site are nice but otherwise its just shops on the inside  My girlfriend said it was one of the top ten things to see in Seoul but I reckon you could safely miss this one,0
606,606,2.0,Other than the brilliant architectural design of the premises there is nothing inside No exhibition and just some stores only,0
541,541,2.0,This is exotic and nice building for sure Made several shots of it But inside I was expecting something unusual inside as well however theres only food and shops Sometimes exhibitions,0
620,620,2.0,This is an attention grabbing building with little utility There is little going on inside Some shops selling modern design wares venders cafe Nothing substantial The Dongdarmun Market bldgs are still there with its shops crammed with products,0
192,192,3.0, There are a lot of interesting exhibitions but it is really hard to find your way inside COEX in Euljiro ,0
508,508,3.0,went to dongdaemun and pass by the DDP for a look around wonderful architecture but thats just it nothing special inside,0
500,500,3.0,Its definitely worth seeing and walking around the exterior of this building but it wasnt worth paying 10000 Won to visit the museum inside There wasnt much in the museum and it featured some drawings paintings and hanboks There was a gift shop in the museum,0
480,480,3.0,It is better to view this from a distance so you can appreciate the whole architecture But once inside there is not much to do,0
475,475,3.0,I think most people come here to see the unique architecture But if you like art go inside Many shops there sell novelties and artsy things,0
453,453,3.0,Only visited during the day Some people say here that it looks great at night Im sure it would They pulled down a huge baseball complex to build this amazing shell of a building on this site Its great looking on the outside but its the opposite of the Tardis Big on the outside virtually nothing on the inside A couple of unattended sad sort of museums  with boxes etc just lying around  a small shopping centre and a train station entry Must have cost a bomb Nice curvy lines yes practical useful  not at all Underutilised An opportunity lost  a concert hall it should have been or just a modern stadium etc  and I love modern architecture but only if it is functional,0
120,120,3.0, I go when there is an exhibition but there is nothing to do inside except for the exhibition They all go around ,0
390,390,3.0,I do love design so I was really looking forward to my visit to the Dongdaemun Design Plaza DDP Having dragged my family to it I must say I was  disappointed  Yes amidst Seouls skyline the DDPs facade is aesthetically unique for its fluid lines and steel curvatures There is no doubt its sheer outline exudes design  But once we appreciated the swooping faade and geometries there is just emptiness inside the building empty rooms empty echoey corridors and vast empty spaces For a designer space is a design element but when we went around 4 pm on April 17 there were no exhibits no permanent showcase not even food trucks Just one big EMPTY building  OK if you are a modern architecture design nut and enjoy photographing shapes but you might want to skip this if you have mixed group For a showcase design plaza they really could have done more with it,0
385,385,3.0,I may have selected the wrong time to visit so take that into account First if you enjoy architecture the building itself is so unique and beautiful that you cant go wrong The building the artistic statues outside perhaps the correct term would be sculptures are definitely worth seeing in person The interior is peaceful and calm which contradicts what you might anticipate looking at the space age like exterior However there wasnt a lot going on inside during my particular visit If you have young kids they would have fun on I believe it was the third or possibly fourth floor,0
358,358,3.0,Interesting building but inside there was a huge hall with many unusual chairs which I suppose were interesting but not particularly inspiring The interior is worn and in need of renovation all in all it seemed like a bit of a white elephant,0
356,356,3.0,Cool place but nothing special other than the building itself Stores and restaurants inside is like any other typical shopping area A place to stopby while you shop and dongdaemun,0
355,355,3.0,My hotel was close to this unusual collection of buildings so we took time to explore including the design exhibition  I found the architecture a bit too brutalist but some will like it  The archaeological diggings in the centre of the buildings were interesting with bilingual signage  We found a Vietnamese restaurant chain outlet inside so inexpensively lunched at that  The below ground Metro station is one of Seouls busiest and quite a labyrinth but if confused just ask a younger local as many now speak English and are exceedingly helpful,0
463,463,3.0,We went to see this at the end of our trip the design museum was closed not sure why Theres a nice gift shop inside with handcrafted items by Korean artists which are reasonable and better quality bought some earrings Ended up at a shopping area Lotte across the street which was standard fare most of the clothing had no prices on them a little odd,0
96,96,3.0, A building where it is difficult to find a straight line Everything inside and outside is curved ,0
217,217,3.0, When I went there were a lot of closed stores inside and I only saw Dalijeon I think the inside content was a bit stale when I went before ,0
326,326,3.0,Was looking forward to coming here but after marvelling at the structure and sculptures outside we were a bit bemused by the inside We only managed to find a cafe and then a huge hall which was empty except for a couple of Mormon brothers having a rest Not sure what the point of the place is,0
293,293,3.0,From the outside amazing architecture just simply amazing but as soon as you step inside the magic disappear rapidly  The space seems to be very poorly used and there is so little design that you wonder where you are  So much potential totally wasted,0
303,303,3.0,Will not visit again Interesting building design from the outside but boring on the inside Noting much to do inside,0
348,348,4.0,Just walking around and experiencing the innovative space new views opening up was interesting The stores  museums Disney inside were of the boring mall variety,1
89,89,4.0,pretty modern architectural building like for the futureout of space day time is nice and night time is also pretty nice place to just walk and sit go inside to check it out if you have time,1
459,459,4.0,South Koreans joke about how this place looks like a spaceship Theres not much to see in the inside if there are no events like the Seoul Fashion Show It is the outside that will be fun for most of tourists Youll get nice Instagram photos here,1
570,570,4.0,The place looks surreal but I enjoyed visiting it especially since we went there at night The building is a sight to see definitely but nothing much to do there There is some shopping inside but the malls across the street from the DDP are more interesting We looked for the touted thousand lighted roses but they were a dud They looked like their lights were on their last blink and they were not worth braving the very cold temp for One visit is enough for me,1
569,569,4.0,We went here on Sunday night to enjoy LED Rose Garden We came from exit 1 of Dongdaemun History and Culture Park station The building was so awesome There was a skating rink there Besides of rose garden there was some exhibitions inside the building Some of the exhibitions were free,1
283,283,4.0,Yes the structure is stunning Amazing architecture Great atmosphere and lots going on However expected more in terms of exhibitions This changes throughout the year Some boutique shops inside and eateries I just think they could have made better use of the indoor space Clean and well kept Definitely recommend going,1

429,429,4.0,the architecture is amazing best time to visit is evening so that you can see the lights  reflections over the huge building there are some exhibition halls inside the building an iconic land mark of Seoul highly recommended,1
493,493,4.0,We went there primarily to shop nearby and took a coffee break inside one of the cafes The structure is really impressive for the architecture and good for photos It is also a subway stop so its handy to exit here and look around this shopping neighborhood,1
496,496,4.0,This is a huge place full of interesting architectural designs There are some shops indoors another museum cool eatingcafe area inside Lots of great spots for pics My daughter was there a couple of months ago during Fashion week  said you could see all kinds of ordinary people dressed wild over the top  cool during that time around there  Our favorite part was relaxing outdoors on the big blue lounge beds You must take your shoes off  then just lay down relax  enjoy the shaded breeze,1
497,497,4.0,As many are aware of the design is the work of the famous Zaha Hadid Looking very cool with futuristic curvy edges But the inside is not impressive There were just a few events and shops It felt like a newly built office building There are some things to have fun though I found a free piano to play near the entrance in the middle,1

517,517,4.0,Beautiful building designed by Zaha Hadid Even though nothing of interest went on inside or around the building for me it is worth an hour just to look around the building,1
482,482,4.0,Im not much into artworks but my sister really wanted to go so we headed over From the outside it is stunning with a couple of lovely statues and inside is pretty cool too  though not as much to see as I thought there would be A few of the areas were pretty enjoyable to look at and I enjoyed the design plaza with all the different shops  lots of cute little items for sale,1
577,577,4.0,Just the building and the surrounding area alone are worth a visit There werent many exhibitions going on when we were there though so the design shop was actually the most interesting thing inside with so much cute anime or kpop inspired things or design pieces,1
446,446,4.0,Fantastic structure on the edge of the inner city of Seoul in the bustling markets of Dongdaemun Located on the site of the old baseball stadium the DDP represents a unique piece of building which looks like a huge sculpture in the classic curvy design of Zaha Hadid Carefully built using BIM modelling the building contains galleries shops and public areas inside and outside for just viewing and enjoying the atmosphere The building has lots of secretes and is worth a tour In December 2018 there will be a display of fine jewelry from the famous jewelry house of Switzerland Definitely worth a look ,1

379,379,4.0,This building was full of curves and flowing lines that made it one of the coolest buildings we visited Inside an almost all white walkway spiraled up to the top floor making for a long walk along the outer circumference of DDP A staircase with an oddly angled and brown contrasting steps brought us back down  The building and surrounding areas were open 24 hours a day I walked around for free inside but to visit any of the exhibits or museums you just had to pay an admission fee roughly W16000 for adults On the ground floor was a temporary exhibit on Disney animation which seemed to be quite popular There also was a Disney store and lots of silkscreened animation scenes from the likes of Frozen Big Hero 6 and Moana On the second floor was an art museum On the third floor was a childrens play area some collaboration space and on the roof a viewing area and a cafe In the back was a lush landscaped area with seating a piano and various art pieces In the front was a large courtyard where lots of people were congregated  My daughter previously visited during the nighttime and enjoyed seeing the building lit up We will have to visit again,1
325,325,4.0,What an amazing building The little shops in DDP were really interesting and worth exploring Spend a lot of time in there Glad that interior is not overly clutter but kept clean and minimalistic The outside was full of activities so it was worth a trip both inside and out,1
308,308,4.0,Vast building designed by Zaha Hadid covering a few city blocks Definitely worth a visit Various shops and galleries inside and usually a lively market outside,1
331,331,4.0,I loved the outside of this structure with its sinuous metal shape winding around gardens and walkways and couldnt wait to explore further It is beautiful and whatever is going on inside the building itself is worth a visit There were two exhibitions on when I visited which were both quite interesting but didnt really float my boat  but thats subjective they were very well presented and worth the time I spent there Take time to explore the building the nooks and crannies and little architectural surprises are a joy to discover,1
362,362,4.0,Some interactive design fun with chairs and pianos This will either be a nice rest stop as there are tons of seating options inside and some lay down options outside or an enjoyable hangout spot if you enjoy design and art Possibly a great place to get high quality gifts,1

611,611,5.0,Even if you arent interested in the exhibition inside visit at night and walk around the complex The lighting reveals how magical this architecture is It will surely steal a lot of photo taking moments  When you visit inside during the daytime you will even more amazed how marvellous this architecture is You will be like strolling along exhibits on the walkway rather than in exhibition rooms Without knowing you will already be on the top floor or bottom floor There are lifts inside but if your physique allows try walking,1

285,285,5.0,I spent an hour and half walking and admiring in the night this structure that was designed by late Zaha Hadid an Iraqiborn British worldrenowned architect It has certainly inspired me on the Dream Design and Play DDP concept behind the Dongdaemun Design Plaza DDP  Getting there Take Subway Line 2 4 5 to get to Dongdaemun History  Culture Park Station and then take exit 1 which is connected to the DDP Once you walk out the exit of subway station the DDP just on the left Climb the lighted stairs to reach the street level for appreciation of DDP  The attraction If you are at the DDP during the day I would recommend a walk around the DDP to appreciate of the unique architecture of the structure  it is built on curves and I did not see any sharp corner and long straight walls It is mentioned that over 40000 aluminium panels cover the DDP exterior of which none is the same I would also recommend a walk inside the DDP  consists of a sky lounge rest area souvenir shop and 5 exhibition halls Art Hall Museum Design Laboratory Oullim Square and Dongdaemun History  Culture Park  It is at night when the DDP really came alive The lightings simply accentuate and dazzle the structure Most of the yellowwhite lightings even moved where these gradually intensified and then dimmed again Participating in the night life is the Rose Garden with a total of some 25550 LED roses  Not only the architecture dazzled at night the artistic talent was also on show when I saw and heard 2 different pianists playing the 2 pianos located in the open  I walked across to the apM Place Shopping Mall and took the elevator to a high floor to get a birds eye view of DDP I think you can also get a nice view from the high floor of other buildings for example the Lotte Fitin Shopping Mall  Overall I enjoyed Dongdaemun Design Plaza DDP in the night more than in the day Nevertheless this is one iconic landmark in Seoul that you would not want to miss It is no wonder that many Korean dramas were filmed here as well including You Who Came from the Stars Producer and She Was Pretty,1

366,366,5.0,I really love the DDP  first of all its exterior design is so pleasing to my eyes Its curvy and fluid and just super cool In the evening when its lights go on it really looks like a spaceship out of Star Trek I enjoy walking around its many corners adoring them over and over again The inside is as cool as the outside With interesting exhibitions stores and the most interesting stairs this place is really worth checking out and especially if you are into design style architecture and space,1
384,384,5.0,The building designed by the wellknown late Zaha Hadid looks like a scifi spaceship landed in the middle of the city aurrounded by shopping malls It looks amazing and walking in it feels like inside something surreal Every corner is curved giving the feeling of endless boundary without borders Really very interesting design concept and realization,1
413,413,5.0,The building alone is worth the time and then there is so much more going on  I took a couple of hours looking around  it is very organic form and I was really interested in the planting scheme as well Lovely that there were pianos dotted around for anyone to play when i was there and the very nice restaurants inside too,1

416,416,5.0,Located in a Seoulstyle block dongdaemun design plaza is a extremely strange but spectacular construction Just like zaha always did she made DDP the an unusual construction and a representation of dongdaemun or even the whole Seoul  I always like zahas design and think it very cool to take photo here You can take very instergrammable photos inside or outside the building since the the Zaha style is everywhere here  If you hope to take some pure architecture photos I would recommend you to come the eighth floor of lotte FITIN which is a shopping mall facing to DDP There are lots of clean windows allowing you to take amazing photos of DDP at night In contrast there are some buildings nearby where you can not take satisfying photos for its dirty windows and terrible views,1
420,420,5.0,Located in Dondaemun and very close to our hotel this was a really interesting place to visit for all the family The building is truly stunning and the design resembles something from the future or like an extraterrestrial space ship You can wander around the outside underneath and inside and the different views of the building continually surprise  Inside there were many things happening There is a huge and fantastic play area for children an exhibition of Wallace  Grommit many shops and restaurants and cultural and art displays Even the stairways in the building are far from normal and cleverly designed  Probably the best time to visit is in the evening time and at night when the building comes to life with subtly placed lights so it even more resembles a flying saucer or space ship  During our visit in the evening time there were stands outdoors where people were selling handcrafted items such as jewellery singers and musicians performing and food trucks from the Seoul Bamdokkaebi Night Market offering all kinds of really delicious local and foreign snacks and street food,1
426,426,5.0,So glad I got to see this building Also Love the shop inside If you are an architect this is a must place to visit in Seoul,1

485,485,5.0,If you are walking around the Dongdaemun area in Seoul City and all of a sudden you notice a piece of architecture that looks like a spaceship Dont worry Seoul City is not about to suffer an alien invasion dont you dare to run what you actually have to do is to go inside that magnificent piece of architecture and let the fantastic futuristic concept and vision of the famous IraquiBritish architect Zaha Hadid to gravitate towards you so you can experience a different state of mind while been there  Ive been in Dongdaemun Design Plaza DDP several times and every time I go there is always a new experience I never get bored of that place There are so many things you can do there take a look at the art and design galleries there are also food festivals at night so you can try Korean and western food as well Inside the building you will see galleries souvenirs shops coffee shops and more  If you have an Instagram profile then you can check the Instagram profile of Dongdaemun Design Plaza and you can see what they have to offer because they upload a schedule of their monthly activities there I will highly recommend you to go there day and night time as well so you can appreciate how different the style and feeling of the architecture can be,1
492,492,5.0,The architecture is beautiful and very futuristic looking There are a bunch of shops inside The second time I came here in 2015 I think there was some type of event going on outside with a stage set up and some music artists were performing It was no one I recognized and I think they were rehearsing for something later in the day or evening It definitely seemed like things were still being set up The subway stops right at the DDP so its convenient to get to via subway You could spend so much time just taking photos outside before even going inside to explore Its also close to Doota and other shopping areas right across the street so expect to spend a few hours in this area if you want to go shopping,1
501,501,5.0,What a fantastic idea So much creativity to see and on the day we went there was an African food market Typical Seoul to always be thought provoking and creative Great coffee shop inside if you need to shelter from the heat or cold too,1
504,504,5.0,I went to the DPP for the first time a few years ago checking out its architecture and the galleries inside Its a must visit for anyone who visits Seoul in particular if you are interested in architecture and design Great photo ops both day and night When I went this time for the exhibition on The Art of Aardman Animations Wallace and Gromit  Friends it was pouring Glad that I already had a detailed look on my last visit Despite the heavy rain a trip there to see the exhibition was very worthwhile The exhibition has already gone to Germany and Australia and is in Seoul now Lucky I could catch it here I am a huge fan of Aardman animations and had a great time viewing the sketches videos original sets with all the details If you go note that photo are not allowed except at 4 spots,1
506,506,5.0,Very artistic and very big but very interesting Lots of things happening inside even if you didnt want to do anything its just nice to be there and enjoy the scenery Lots of shopping opportunities Love Seoul,1
