285,285,5.0,I spent an hour and half walking and admiring in the night this structure that was designed by late Zaha Hadid an Iraqiborn British worldrenowned architect It has certainly inspired me on the Dream Design and Play DDP concept behind the Dongdaemun Design Plaza DDP  Getting there Take Subway Line 2 4 5 to get to Dongdaemun History  Culture Park Station and then take exit 1 which is connected to the DDP Once you walk out the exit of subway station the DDP just on the left Climb the lighted stairs to reach the street level for appreciation of DDP  The attraction If you are at the DDP during the day I would recommend a walk around the DDP to appreciate of the unique architecture of the structure  it is built on curves and I did not see any sharp corner and long straight walls It is mentioned that over 40000 aluminium panels cover the DDP exterior of which none is the same I would also recommend a walk inside the DDP  consists of a sky lounge rest area souvenir shop and 5 exhibition halls Art Hall Museum Design Laboratory Oullim Square and Dongdaemun History  Culture Park  It is at night when the DDP really came alive The lightings simply accentuate and dazzle the structure Most of the yellowwhite lightings even moved where these gradually intensified and then dimmed again Participating in the night life is the Rose Garden with a total of some 25550 LED roses  Not only the architecture dazzled at night the artistic talent was also on show when I saw and heard 2 different pianists playing the 2 pianos located in the open  I walked across to the apM Place Shopping Mall and took the elevator to a high floor to get a birds eye view of DDP I think you can also get a nice view from the high floor of other buildings for example the Lotte Fitin Shopping Mall  Overall I enjoyed Dongdaemun Design Plaza DDP in the night more than in the day Nevertheless this is one iconic landmark in Seoul that you would not want to miss It is no wonder that many Korean dramas were filmed here as well including You Who Came from the Stars Producer and She Was Pretty,1
286,286,4.0,DDP is Zaha Hadid design and definitely the icon of Dongdaemun There are a couple of subway stations that stop directly underneath or nearby hence easy to get to The Plaza overall is quite large in size with shops exhibitions and art installations There are leaderboards with maps in many locations hence easy to find your way around Nearby DDP are underground shopping night markets Dongdaemum Gate a couple fo hotels and plenty of shops and restaurants Dongdaemun and DDP are must visit sights when in Seoul,1

329,329,5.0,As an architecture buff I found this plaza in Seoul to feature one of the most innovative modern structures that I have seen I first visited the 7level 4 above ground and 3 below building during the day and was so impressed that I returned to introduce the center to my husband that night Designed by architect Zaha Hadid the futuristic construction exhibits no straight lines or right angles Instead it presents elongated curvy forms built with concrete and cloaked in 45000 aluminum panels  At night the centers lights seem to glow from within At certain exterior vantage points its shape and silvery hue give the impression of what I imagine a giant spaceship to look like The park next to the building further enhances the look It holds 25550 LED roses which light up 5 minutes after sunset and are absolutely stunning It was a magical experience to stroll here in the dark  Inside the curves continue in long corridors and connecting stairways there are also standard elevators The center serves as a fairly new venue for design in Seoul featuring an art hall meeting space a museum a design lab and a design market I visited the huge lab which displays a variety of wellcrafted items for sale and gives visitors the opportunity to meet the designers We enjoyed a light dinner in one of the many eateries in the market which is connected to the nearby Dongdaemun shopping centers  DDP located in Downtown Seoul is easily reached by subway Take Line 2 4 or 5 to Dongdaemun History and Culture Park Station and leave through exits 1 or 10,1
374,374,4.0,Dongdaemun Design Plazas curvy and wave structure catches my eye in a neighbourhood of straight boxy office buildings Without the signages you would not know where is the entrance to the building  We walked around the DPP on a late afternoon to appreciate its exterior Each different angle gives you a fresh perspective of the building  We didnt visit any of the indoor exhibitions There are shops cafe and restaurants in the basement and street artists who could do a quick portrait for you  The DDP is directly connected to a subway station Ill recommend a visit in the early evening,1
376,376,4.0,If you are a designer or has likes to see various creative work then this is an area you should visit while in Seoul There are a lot of shops exhibits activities that you can visit and experience Coffee shops food shops etcare available as this is located on top of a subway train station Dongdaemum History  Culture Park,1

467,467,5.0,Come over to experience one of the last great architectural masterpieces by Zaha Hadid It will not disappoint She quickly understood that Seoul is defined by its seven rings of mountains Resembling a blobby mountainscape you can walk on top of the complex and see the mountains yourself Come at about dusk The night illumination of this building is stunning Inside one of the wings has a great collection of design stores that is easy to walk through and enjoyable to browse The other wings have changing exhibitions and shows Incredibly easy to get to as it is connected to the subway Dont forget the world famous GwangJang Open Market featured on travel shows worldwide for the cheapest and best eats Take a stroll along the Cheonggye Cheon Canal to get away from the city,1
492,492,5.0,The architecture is beautiful and very futuristic looking There are a bunch of shops inside The second time I came here in 2015 I think there was some type of event going on outside with a stage set up and some music artists were performing It was no one I recognized and I think they were rehearsing for something later in the day or evening It definitely seemed like things were still being set up The subway stops right at the DDP so its convenient to get to via subway You could spend so much time just taking photos outside before even going inside to explore Its also close to Doota and other shopping areas right across the street so expect to spend a few hours in this area if you want to go shopping,1
493,493,4.0,We went there primarily to shop nearby and took a coffee break inside one of the cafes The structure is really impressive for the architecture and good for photos It is also a subway stop so its handy to exit here and look around this shopping neighborhood,1

584,584,5.0,Located next to the Dongdaemun History and Culture Park subway station DDP looks amazing in its design I wasnt into architecture as much but it was a great to see something this unique In addition to the exterior there were exhibitions inside that showcase some intriguing and quirky everyday products from local designers that can be bought DDP is surrounded by multiple shops in the Dongdaemun area so it can be a little side trip from shopping,1
589,589,4.0,Newest landmark connected to the subway and history and culture park station There are some building artitechure statues There is a park way Near by are shopping malls street market and seoul city wall and museum,1
631,631,4.0,Dongdaemun is a pretty interesting place with its countless street markets and architectural design but its nothing really more than a few photo ops here or there I do visit Dongdaemun frequently to clear the head after a heavy night out but there really isnt anything you would write home about If you are into photography it is a fantastic place to practice your depth of fields and length snapping but its nothing compared to the palaces you have on offer a mear 3 or 4 stops away in Jonggak or City hall I suggest visiting only if you have bags of time and you are passing Dongdaemun on the subway,1
