2193,2193,3.0,Maybe it is only because I am a guy but this shopping area was nothing special for me During the day time it is a bit more leisurely but at night the streets become much more narrow because of the food vendors and it seems busier I did find that there are multiple shops from the same company located in this center which kind of confused me but what the heckI am a guy I also found out that there was no haggling over prices there You dont like the price goes elsewhere Street food vendors were ok but a bit pricey Had grilled lobster from one of them that ran around 15000 won which is between 13 to 15 US But what the heck is cheese on it for I would rather have had butter,0
