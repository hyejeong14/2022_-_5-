1043,1043,5.0,In my view Myeongdong is the mustvisit place for the hundreds of restaurants shops and night market stalls spread across 99 HA of land From the exit of Myeongdong station one must remember the route taken not so much as not to be lost but to explore every nick and hook of this shopping paradise in Seoul  Street food served by night market stalls is expensive but not unaffordable This is after all a popular and famous tourist spot One advice is not to gobble up every food that intrigues you so that you wont regret not having any more capacity for delicacies 1 hour later  The streets are straight and they criss cross one another Many shops are duplicated selling cosmetics and skincare products worth a buy since they are generally half the price compared to the home country of the tourists  Myeongdong  one day is definitely not enough,1

5715,5715,5.0,I loved Myeongdong If you are looking for shopping this is one of the best places in Korea to go  Myeongdong has everything The stores range from ridiculously highend places with 700 heels and worldclass designer wear to the street stall markets and shops that you would see in places like Namdaemun and Itaewon Youll also find everything inbetween  I personally love how there are so many boutiques that sell trendy clothing from local designersyou can find things that are oneofakind and great quality too These small stores are sandwiched between massive versions of stores that supply quality and affordable basics like Forever 21 Zara and HM  Also this is one of the few places in Korea where western sizes arent problematic I found jeans that are cut for curvier bodies a rarity here  The best part of Myeongdong is that the streets are vibrant and crowded Kpop is blaring along side the old pop that drawls from cheap radios in the stands and stalls eyepopping fashion trends whizz by on 5 inch heels and bizarre fusion foods are piled high on skewers and grills you really get a feel for the crazy balibali atmosphere of old meets new Korea as you shop,1
