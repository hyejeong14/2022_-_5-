880,880,2.0,Lotte world itself is a pretty cool place Easy to access via subway clean and a lot going on I personally went for the sole purpose of ice skating though To start I was quite dissapointed that I could not use my own skates because they where hockey skates That was the first time i had ever experienced that but its a business The ice was crowded your not allowed to skate backwards and for the price of admissionabout 10000won the sheet was poorly maintained If you are going here to skate Seoul has WAY BETTER places than this Check out Mockdong Korea University and IParkwinter only,0
1500,1500,2.0,On our trip to Seoul last week we decided to visit 1 theme park for the benefit of my son We chose Lotte world as it is the easiest to get to by subway to Jamsil station  Although we went on a weekday it was still packed with Korean kids and we needed to Q for rides  Even though the place is huge the rides are quite dated and old but kids being kids my son love this place as adults we feel it is a waste of time haha  So chose this place only if you have kids and you want to go to a place where transportation to and fro is easy,0
765,765,3.0,Seoul must go to amusement park to rival Disneyland Have most of the rides you would want including virtual reality and 3D 4D shows There is a large indoor area where around twothirds of the rides and attractions with the outdoor Magic Island accommodating the others We went on a public holiday in Korea where foreigners get a 50 discount but unfortunately We bought the day pass which was normally priced at KRW 52000 it was so crowded and queues typically had a waittime of between 23 hours crazy It was also stuffy and after a while inside we were dying for some fresh air We were there for only 4 hours and managed just one ride  the Fly Venture If you really want to enjoy the place best to plan ahead arrive really early in the morning If you dont like crowds especially packed indoors this is not the place for you The subway station for Lotte World is Jamsil Lines 2 and 8,0
1510,1510,3.0,Although the theme park is an old friend and one I like to visit this time I went next door to the newly completed mall the tower is still under construction This shopping mall has been plagued by many problems about construction and dealines but is finally open to the public as of the middle of November 2014 Could some of the things I mention here be a part of the teething problems Probably and I hope they will be fixed before my next visit First of all I have to say that the architecture is splendid along the lines of making all customers believe they have entered a treasure cave Marble floors and pillars gilded bannisters and trims fairy lights  it all combines to turn the space into the inside of a glaring white disco ball I longed for some muted colors and corners someplace less white and gleaming and glaring but maybe thats just my personal taste What I can commend them on is adequate signage  everywhere you look are signs directing you to the subway lines the movie theatres the aquarium the shops the food courts etc There are also plenty of automated info screens that you can use to search for a place  and in plenty of languages Very touristfriendly But  no indications as to how far youll have to walk and believe me you will have to walk quite a way Also no indications about restrooms except one Most of the shops were still unpacking and setting up and those that were up and running had an eager air about them Im not sure what they are paying to rent space but Im sure it will be reflected in their prices As for spaces where a person can just sire down for a moment and rest before tackling the rest not in evidence Unless you enter a restaurant you are not going to catch your breath unless you sit on the floor If you have such a large space you need to provide such an amenity Is it worth a visit Yes possibly to visit the aquarium and the movie theatre Will it have stuff you cant find anywhere else Maybe but it doesnt look like it at this stage,0
845,845,3.0,I visited Lotte World during winter and maybe this affected my experience but I couldnt find anything exceptional in this park the attractions are in the average the most interesting part for me was that a big part of the park is indoor and you can arrive there directly with the subway spend time inside and then continue your visit in the outdoor part of the park In my opinion is a good place to visit if you have children and the weather is not the best otherway there are much better park to visit,0
1578,1578,3.0,Admission price is quite pricy need to buy tickets each time you ride so it can be cheaper to purchase 1 day passif you have little kids they will enjoy this magical world but can really be boring for adultSpend half a day here only This atrraction has direct access to green line subwayeasy to lcate and connected to lotte dept storeWord of adviceremember the entrance we spent 30 minutes jst to find the exit not much sign around,0
343,343,3.0,Check in was easy and friendly Obviously the location is excellent if you like to shop or go to Lotte world theme park Theres a subway station right in front Not a lot to do nearby once the mall closes at 10 My friend enjoyed the sauna while my teens enjoyed the theme park The beds were comfortable but the rooms had no drawer space Hotels bakery did have much but theres plenty to eat a decent breakfast at the underground shopping go downstairs thru the Lotte department store doorway Theres lotteria angel in us coffee shopbreakfast sandwich krispy cremedoughnuts samsong bakeryfamous breadpastriesodeng place that opens before the mall opens Then theres the food court at the mall Take the end elevator to get a great view of the outdoor theme park I would definitely stay again if the price is right,0
730,730,3.0,Lotte World is for kids Nice outdoor and indoor rides but if you are a group of adults this theme park is not for you I think its best to go to Everland out of Seoul Although its nice to go to the area around Lotte World because of the newly opened Lotte Sky Seoul Tower and it is also nice to take a walk along the Songpa district especially during spring when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom If you are staying at a Lotte Hotel branch there is a free shuttle bus to and from Lotte World theme park Can also easily be reached by subway Jamsil station if Im not mistaken You can go around the park in just an hour or two,0
896,896,3.0,We were there for about 6 hours Add point is it is easily accessible by subway and not easily missed due to the ample signage along the station Given that you are not distracted by the shopping arcade along the way It was on a Friday that we went to check it out It was pretty crowded with tourists school children and local people However the longer queue took only 30 minutes Our kids loved the theme park especially the Camelot Carousel World monorail kids bumper cars and train rides However we were disappointed that the balloon rides for small kids were under maintenance We suggested family with small kids should do some homework prior visiting There were rides that need accompany and most of the rides require kids to be above 110cm It means if you have a 3 yearold he might not get to play those rides he wants to even with accompany,0

558,558,3.0,Do yourself a favour and dont buy the tickets with rides if you do not have atleast 1 full dayThe queues are extremely long and the wait is anywhere from 12 hours for each ride They do have a general admission ticket which only lets you see inside but no ride They have both an indoor and outdoor areaIndoor area rides are mostly for kids and outdoor area for adultsWell worth a visit though You can take the subway to reach,0
879,879,4.0,We were late to submit the review We went to Lotte World last December and travelling there was easy via direct subway As it was December winter I supposed the locals escape the freezing temperature and went to Lotte to keep their warm Lotte was extremely crowded and all the rides were in a long Q We managed to grab some interesting rides but the rest of day was spent roaming indoor It was good that it had their Trick Eyes section We had some guns taking wonderful photos as it saved our time having to travel to the actual Trick Eyes in Hondae,1
912,912,4.0,Our family has been to Disney World 7 times If Disney World is what you are looking for I would highly recommend you start saving and I mean SAVING So no Lotte World is not Disney World and its never going to be Disney World but it also doesnt charge what Disney World charges If you are trying to decide whether or not to take your kids to Lotte World then just go For the price you simply cant beat it We took our daughter for her 9th birthday and she is a thrill ride junky Lucky for us the outside area opened up it was raining early that morning and the rides on Magic Island were open and running There are several rides inside that she enjoyed but most of the indoor rides and for little kids As a family we had a blast There is a great variety of rides for our 9 year old AND our 3 year old Here are some key things you need to know prior to going 1 They are very strict about the height requirement for every single ride In fact they will probably measure your kids and then slap a wrist band on them similar to the type you get at the hospital indicating the height of your child There is no smooth talking any of the attendants if your kid misses the height by an inch thats it they dont make it on the ride 2 If you do not favor Korean food they have hotdogs corn dogs a hamburger joint and a pizza place The pizza looked off and we attempted to order 4 beef hamburgers for approx 5 solid minutes and we got everything from shrimp burgers to chicken patties on the tray We ended up just taking the chicken patties which were a little off They came with mayo and teriyaki sauce on them We didnt like them at all The parking is easy to get to but since Lotte World is in a busy part of the city I would recommend the subway system 3 You have to be 6 years or older to skate on the ice rink We brought socks for everyone but decided not to go when we found out our 3 year old couldnt skate 4 Once you leave Lotte World there is no reentry We were looking smack dab at a TGIFs but couldnt get to it because we wouldnt be allowed back in Bottom Line  GO FOR IT Its definitely worth it The lines were very short usually waited about 10 minutes per ride Go have fun we did,1
1066,1066,4.0,Went there during rainy dayspend more time inside then outdoorthe 3D movie rides are not goodtoo childish n non excitingsome rides need to pay eg haunted housenot included in ticket pricelove the hot air balloon ridethe outdoor rides cater more to the adventurous adultsthe performance was cancelled due to rain and most rides closed as wellbut can really spent whole day herelocation is very gooddirectly outside subway stationlove the korean cultural museum most,1
1171,1171,4.0,We went to Lotte World on our last day of our holiday Due to the rainy weather we were stayed at the indoor theme park This is great for all ages especially for familys We took the subway to get to Lotte World,1

1227,1227,4.0,Lotte World is located in Chamsil within the city of Seoul at a subway stop for added convienience Proximity wise it is along the Han river beyond ApkuJongDong on the same side as Gangnam and near the Olympic park area I wouldnt necessary stay at the Lotte hotel attached as per my memory rooms were small and beds tiny Better to stay near Coex at Park Hyatt if not then Intercontinental or further out at Grand Hyatt  Lotte World has been around for many years and this review is mainly for the indoor adventure park which is attached to a huge shopping mall Across the street intersection is the Lotte new world mall the tallest building  We were able to get discounted tickets for free use of the park for just about 20000 won each around 20 US by using certain promotional related approved credit cards that relied mostly on LG or other card You can check with the staff there but basically my Korean host paid for it and I chipped in  On the lowest level is an ice skating rink On the above levels around it is the adventure park and also folk village separate entry Once we paid for our tickets into the park we ate at one of restaurants around the upper level of the rink found a small buffet called Seven springs which was decent We then entered the park and spent a nice afternoon watching live performances there were many and Xmas themed It made us feel very cheerful for the holiday and the performances were impressive and festive Especially rock n roll santa Elvis There was a small gallery within the park that was enjoyable for photos We did not ride many rides and the monorail we did ride seemed dated There is an outdoor portion the park but it was too cold to go outside The mirror maze was fun but a few extra Won just for that attraction All other attractions were free per our entrance fee This can be a lowkey enjoyable family event and cant comment on if I would just go for the rides there because thats just not my cup of tea There does seem to be a VR roller coaster coaster updated with VR googles various on top of water rides like indoor jungle boat and flume Theres an indoor kids play area which was too packed to stand in line for The balloon ride circling the park seemed like a very scenic and slow ride more so than monorail The park has two main characters Lotte and Lorry and they are cute and the concessions cheap enough to wear and have fun with  The folk village is nice to have nearby for folks who want a taste of Korea and history For a real taste of Korean history go to Geongbokgung to walk the palace grounds and museum and nearby Insadong to buy souvenirs and tea  Lotte mall lower level has a food court option I think Hyundai dept stores have more impressive food courts The mall itself is affordable to expensive depending on what you are looking for  Lotte new world mall tall building has newer stores to shop and a decent aquarium on the basement A modern place to eat there on street level is Bills  This entire block of Lotte malls and attractions would like fill a few afternoons of fun and variety needed for everyone,1
1233,1233,4.0,We had a late flight on our last day in Seoul and thus we planned to visit Lotte World because it didnt require a private tour guide We hired one for the prior three days to take us around Seoul The park is easily accessible by subway and the station that serves Lotte World is Jamsil station which is on subway lines 2 and 8  I think the park carter to younger kids most rides are familiar and expected to be in a theme park nonetheless the kids still had a great time  The price of food at their food court is reasonable and some taste good indeed Although its an indoor park a small portion of it is outdoor and connected by a bridge all in all its good on very hot or raining or cold weather ,1
1247,1247,4.0,An excellent place for kids to enjoy with fantastic shows and a parade Good location by subway Line 2 going to Jamsil Station,1
1294,1294,4.0,You could spend a whole day here or even two and still not see every single part of it Lotte world is massive like really big And its got absolutely everything you could want In terms of shopping its probably the biggest mall in S Korea and its got every store you can think of and every item you may need The food hall was my favourite place to go when I needed something a little more western and its well connected by subway so its also a great place to go during the winter months And when you get bored of shopping theres the amusement park I had heard a lot about Lotte World Amusement Park and I was interested in seeing how theyd make it work being indoors Ive got to say theyve done it pretty well Spread over a few floors the themeing is beautifully done and you tend to forget that outside theres a mall full of busy shoppers It is geared towards younger children but the rides are still super fun and there are a few thrill rides to keep the adults happy Theres the usual korean food brands and a loads of confectionary stands You can even buy facial products Id definitely recommend checking it out if you have a spare day,1
1307,1307,4.0,Before you go check out Lotte Worlds website for discount coupons We saved almost 50 on our admission fee The coupon said we had to have our passports to show we were foreigners but they never checked for them We took 3 kids 11 12 13 with us and they really enjoyed themselves There were rides and activities for everyone to enjoy We went midweek to avoid longer lines and I think that was a good call Our longest wait was 45 minutes for the big roller coaster We were annoyed that outside several of the big rides were closed This was not advertised and was disappointing Unlike parks in North America our bags were not searched for food so we were able to carry in some healthy snacks We bought lunch and ice cream inside at pretty reasonable prices Bathrooms are nice water in taps and fountains is potable The park has a lot to offer but is pretty compact which is nice as were werent totally exhausted from long walks between rides This is a wholeday outing Its really easy to access from the subway,1
1325,1325,4.0,We took our almost 2 year old to Lotte World Kids tori was the highlight of his trip well worth the entire trip There were only 5 rides he was tall enough to ride because it was raining we couldnt take him outside Overall it was a fun trip The parades and shows were all very good and well done Easy trip by subway,1
1477,1477,4.0,It was a rainy Monday in Seoul when my husband and I decided to bring our teenager daughters to Lotte World From Samseoung it only took us 15 minutes via Taxi to go to Lotte World The park is also connected to subways lines 2 and 8 Lotte World is made up of two parks The Magic Island outdoor and more thrilling rides and Adventure  indoor more on kids rideWe got lucky the rain stopped in the afternoon so we enjoyed the both sides of the park The National Folk Museum inside Lotte World is also a bonus its a beautiful exhibit of the Three Kingdoms of Korea Overall the experience was fun and enjoyable It exceed my expectations and my family all agreed that Lotte World is a great Seoul experience,1
1536,1536,4.0,This indooroutdoor amusement park is quite pricey but if you came after 4 pm you can buy discounted ticket for 26000 won Indoor section is most likely for children but it can be fun for adults too While outdoor section is filled with some sorts of adrenaline pumping rides It also has a giant skating rink but you have to purchase different ticket from Lotte World ticket Lotte World is easily accessible via subway since one of the subway station exit is within Lotte Mall,1
822,822,4.0,When we were in Seoul we wanted to do an amusement park We were told there were two good ones and this one was better for younger kids Since we had an 8 year old that enjoys roller coasters we thought itd be better to do this one and if we came back in the future to do the other park We had a great time here  We took the subway and it was very easy to walk there from the station This park is about 23 inside and 13 outside We did most of the inside and only a few of the outside as it was raining and when its wet they close the outdoor coasters They did open them in the afternoon but not all and we didnt get to do everything  Inside there are 4 floors On the top is an Egyptian ride we liked probably best of all with lots of cool replicas and stuff and a hot air balloon ride which went around the entire inside part It was a cool view and there was a special tunnel part but the wait was crazy long  On the 3rd floor was the monorail but it was closed because of the rain And another ride called Jungle Adventure The 2nd floor has a fast roller coaster and bumper cars  The 1st floor had most of the rides from a swinging boat a water ride with a big splash carousel and a ride with a 360 on it There was a ride called Drunken Basket which was like the mad hatter tea cups at Disneyland  Below the 1st floor you could see a big ice skating rink but we did not go down there I cost extra  Outside was one of those ride where you site in a big ring around a tower that goes all the way to the top and then drops you I hate those in your seat and goes partially back up and does it again a few times There were two coasters that were closed a walk through ghost house a ferris wheel magic show and more One part of the haunted house scaredupset my son a little bit with a cat becoming a ghost There was also a big castle you could walk through outside  There were several showsperformances with people in costumes They seemed geared toward little under 6 crowd on the first floor There was a tram that came through and there were ladies hanging off the side like Vegas show girls very sparkly with exotic outfits The park has two main mascots Lotty and Lorry and their faces and likeness were on lots of things throughout the park There were some animatronics  They park did have a fast pass type thing called Magic Pass to get a ticket to go to the front of the line at a later time You constantly had to show your admission ticket to ride things since they have an all day unlimited and a like 10 ride pass I lost mine but they didnt make a big deal about replacing it though they said I only get one replacement  There were a lot of food options with a good amount of variety actually You could get Korean food hotdogs pizza burgers Chinese kebabs and more The food we got wasnt amazing but it wasnt bad either  There were lots of shops to buy things at and we bought some cat ear headbands that my son loved so much he wore the rest of our trip in Korea  Our visit was such a very fun day If you have kids under 13 this is a great place to go,1
820,820,4.0,The easiest in term of transportation if you need to go to lotte world Just go to jamsil via subway One of the exit leads to lotte entrance Its also connected to a lotte shoppong mall So you can throw two stone at once The park is extremely beautiful Too bad when we went there its buddha birthday so the rides took hours for us to play Outdoor rides is more extreme and indoor is more to adventure Parade is great And yes theres and ice skating rink available Trick eye museum,1
1616,1616,4.0,During our stay it was raining so this place was great for entertaining the kids It is easy to get to Just take the subway to Jamsil station and the entrance is inside before you exit the station They have several rides inside and outside Some of them are copies of Disneyland rides such as Pirates of the Caribbean and Indiana Jones with a completely different theme There was also a parade with large floats that looked very Disney The inside park also has a large skating rink Outside they have a big Cinderellas castle and rides which were closed during the rain This amusement park is great for kids but for adults there are more authentic things to do in Seul,1
804,804,4.0,We went to Lotte World on a beautiful October day in Seoul Our guesthouse Mmmio house highly recommended was close to a subway station and from there it took us about half an hour to get to Lotte World on the other side of the river which splits Seoul in two parts Upon arrival at the Jamsil station green line 2 by subway the signs direct you immediately to the Lotte Department Store and other Lotte things to dosee including Lotte Adventure World As we prefer not to wait in line we were excited to see ticket machines which also displayed information in English After having tried all of them we asked staff why the English version on the machines did not work and were told that the machines are not for foreigners Staff very nicely directed us to the counter to buy tickets Second in line suddenly the counter closed and we were directed to another line This was not nice but ok since only about 6 people were waiting in front of us now After half an hour  waiting we could finally buy our ticket but were asked for our passports Not being made aware by anybody that we needed passports I luckily realized that I had a residence card from another country with me A few discussions later with different staff we were allowed to buy four tickets The cost USD 150 seemed high It was a fairly quiet day in the park so the waiting for most attractions was not bad The park has three or four levels and from each level you can see the levels below There is also an outside area with more attractions The park is in the middle of the city and it is quite amazing how they have used the limited space to build so many attractions Although we had tickets which allowed us to access all attractions we did have to pay for one attraction the Tomb of horror or something like that It is approx USD 25 per person Everland is a more recently opened amusement park and bigger than Lotte Adventure World but further away Early 2016 a brand new amusement park will be opened,1
751,751,4.0,Great place to have fun with friends can spend a whole day there There is stuff for everyone to enjoy Very easy to get to from the subway station which is right underground,1
224,224,4.0,If you have younger kids this place is great Plan to spend the whole day there as there is lots of stuff to do with younger kids If you have teenagers then it will be a shorter trip since rides are more geared toward younger folks think magic kingdom at Disney Food is surprisingly reasonably prices and this place is very clean  The only negative is that if you dont speak  read Korean buying tickets and getting in can get a bit confusing but there are staff there that can help It is very convenient to get to since it is located at a major subway stop attached to a very nice and large mall,1

836,836,5.0,We visited Lotte World on a Monday for my sons birthday and it was such a good time We took advantage of the 50 off with military ID or dependent  thankfully had the kids IDs too since its only good for 4 tickets We spent 5 hours there and no one did everything but we filled every minute with fun The teenagers and tweens took off and did their own thing at the park even managed to get their ticket replaced on their own when one of them lost theirs Reminder you need to show your ticket at every ride so keep it handy and on each person if possible They did the indoor roller coasters and outdoor ones as well The moms took the younger set to do all that was available and didnt get through all of it Fair food is very good especially the sodafried cheese balls combo always a hit with my guys 9 year olds went on the log flume solo which was about a 15 minute wait at 12 noon and loved it Too bad our favorite ride the Dinosaur 3D target practice was closed for inspection And the kids really enjoyed the trick eye exhibit on 4F This is our 3rd visit in a year and we still havent done it all Took the subway there and back Couldnt be easier or more enjoyable Will probably go again,1
