644,644,1.0,This is a reasonably fine place for some overpriced street food and shopping  Please avoid the touts on the streets who will try to entice you with some cheap massage packages As the saying goes if it is to be true then it probably is Once you follow them to the massage parlor the sales staff there will pressurize you to take up very expensive sessions if you are not keen they would exert more high selling tactics Once you refused to take up any of these exorbitantly priced session and opt for the lower price one they would turn sulky As it turned out a 45 minute session became a mere 20 minute session When I informed the staff about the session had ended way too early the staff did not bother and insisted that it was already 45 minutes  The massage was also woefully bad Please do not go for any massage in this Myeongdong area,0
1126,1126,1.0,I came here because of a meeting The streets are filthy with trash its crowded every stores are overpriced Would not recommend,0
5193,5193,2.0,A local told me that Myeongdong more of a strolling destination for locals rather than a place to eat or shop Tourists though love this place because of all the shops and tourist friendly restaurants I stayed in this area and ate in this area The food was overpriced 15000krw for a single bowl of bibimbap 35000krw for three strips of beef for the grill The upside is that this neighborhood is very central well connected by the subway has decent hotels and can have some nice crowds and food carts at night before the shops close at around 11pm,0
2520,2520,2.0,This is an overpriced tacky place where people go to look the same Many of the streets have the same shops on them so you can look exactly like everyone else in Seoul Shudder  There are some cool street merchants and the century old Catholic Church on the hill are a nice diverting highlight,0
2733,2733,3.0,Great place especially at night if you dont mind tons of people Used to be so much better still have memories of good old Myongdong Now its flooded with tourists and locals shops are mostly Korean cosmetics Etude House Nature Republic Skin Food etc and popular international brands not so much of Korean clothing or accessories Street food is hugely overpriced Again the main problem is that its too popular and too crowded at night Daytime it looks like any other street in a Korean city,0
2748,2748,3.0,For sure theres tons and tons of places for you to shop for yout skincare requirements Theres a huge Olive Young where you can get almost everything you need there as well as Boots Some shops will treat you better than others and most shop assistants would be able to converse in Chinese or Japanese but very very little English Usually if I need to buy stuff Id come early like 10am or 11am when it is less crowded 4pm onwards and the people starts coming in droves Food options are aplenty but I feel the food is bit overpriced and underwhelming in the two shops we tried The small Cafes are pretty worth a visit though,0
2223,2223,3.0,The streetfood is definitely overpriced And the stalls are repeated so you see different people selling similar food items in the whole stretch With the amount of money we spent on streetfood we could have had a decent meal in a proper restaurant,0
2890,2890,3.0,This place is really a haven for cosmeticbuff If you intend to buy or looking for a good brand with discounts then this is the place for you Other than that i would skip the place Other stuff like streetfood and clothes etc are overpriced compared to other places like Insadong namdaemun market and bukchon hanok village shops,0
3049,3049,3.0,Went here on a Friday evening For girls this would be a oneday stop So many shops especially for cosmetics and skincare Almost all the salespeople speak Chinese too Not too much to see for guys maybe some street food But even then I think they may be overpriced They do have more variety of street food than other shopping districts though  I personally prefer Hongdae More selection for guys less crowded younger vibe slightly less touristy,0
973,973,3.0,I found things are overpriced compared with other shoppings street  Well there still a lot of entertainment for your view,0
5158,5158,3.0,Loads of shopping  not always at the best prices If you have no time this is the place to go where you have loads of beauty shops restaurants etc Some things are overpriced,0
3233,3233,3.0,Myeongdong is great for buying makeup as there are literally hundreds of makeup stores The street food is overpriced compared to other areas but still good It gets very busy later in the day Shop assistants will stand infront of their store handing out beauty face masks but only take it if you actually want to go inside their shop and buy something If you walk in and dont buy anything they will take the mask back from you Its like a ticket to see their products One visit to Myeongdong is enough if youre not into shopping for beauty products,0
3657,3657,4.0,Be sure to spot the guides and get a map Rows and rows of similar brands shops will make one giddy and lost Get free samples by just visiting the shop even if it is window shopping There are loads of street food come evening time but they are overpriced for the tourists so save your money and eat elsewhere,1
2905,2905,4.0,Pretty crowded and full of Korean cosmetics shops and restaurants I think some of the restaurants are overpriced since its a tourist spot,1
2899,2899,4.0,There are many tasty things to eat here but I think the shopping is getting overpriced You can find better deals inside of subway stations,1
5017,5017,4.0,As another reviewer said there are a ton of Korean cosmetic shops here I saw probably 2 or 3 shops for each brand and I think they outnumbered all the other kinds of shops combined So if youre looking to stock up on some fantastic Korea beauty products for half of what they would cost to order them online this is the place for you They also lure you into the stores with free samples although you dont have to buy anything There are other kinds of shops if you want to take a look around but nothing special Mostly overpriced clothes and souvenir shops My boyfriend did get a very amusing hat here though,1
2749,2749,4.0,Great for Skincare and Cosmetic Shopping You can find any makeup mask you want in the area and it is much cheaper Street Food was overpriced compared to other areas and the taste was only mediocre,1
5116,5116,4.0,A must see the shopping crazy asian approach From a European point of view overpriced and wondering what they do with those cosmetic patches applied to breasts and buts,1
2644,2644,4.0,We stayed at a hotel near Myeongdong so we went to this street everyday There were variety of shops in this area At about 400 pm they opened the stalls along the Myeongdong 10gil There were a few halal stalls where Muslims can taste the local food There were also a few halal restaurants in this area but I think they were overpriced Anyway it is recommended to shopping during sales season We got a lot of discounts plus tax refunds,1
5302,5302,4.0,Visiting Myeondong Night Market was a good decision because the food is delicious and cheap You can choose from a variety of street foodjuices grilled meat dessert ice cream There are also many dry goods bags shoes clothes etc in the stalls that are reasonably priced But you need to compare the prices of some food stuff with the grocery We found some items to be overpriced,1
2273,2273,4.0,This shopping area is quite big but definitely can be covered within a couple of hours There are many restaurants throughout but they are more hidden within alleys or up the stairwells There are many repeats of the same stores over and over again so Im not too sure if its necessary to cover the whole area for some At about 56pm food stall vendor will line the Main Street The food is excellent and theres a huge variety but it is slightly overpriced for certain items,1
1789,1789,4.0,Loving the shopping here althought usually very crowded and some things are overpriced Got really cheap bags for 10 000 won here,1
1749,1749,4.0,The title says it all Walk down the street of Myeongdong and you will find 810 skincare shops per block Walk down to the next block and you will find the same skincare shops but in a different arrangement There were many clothing stores as well but some are the usual stores like Uniqlo and Zara but others are small boutiques selling extremely expensive clothes which I think is overpriced and overrated For made in Korea clothing its cheaper to shop in Dongdaemun or Nanta There is also a big flagship store of MCM leather goods but seeing every asian tourist carrying one it immediately became a turnoff for me to purchase one The street food there is wonderful I love the idea of a cart selling cut grapefruit right out of the peel Healthy and delicious When i was there this cart was right in front of Nanta Myeongdong near a Burger King Fresh lemonade was also essential when walking around in the sun In short a very convenient place with everything you need Most of the food weve tried here were good,1
638,638,4.0,Items may be overpriced at street stalls May help if you do some research on what you want to buy Can find bargains too Huge variety of food clothes and shoes Avoid if you dislike rubbing shoulders with hoards of tourists its almost inevitable Appears to be very popular with Chinese tourists,1
1381,1381,4.0,Overall this is a good place for shopping with lots of eateries around I will not recommend to eat the street food here although the taste of the food is quite good but most of it are just overpriced If you really looking for a meal I will suggest u to go for a restaurant instead,1
720,720,4.0,A lot of my visitors to Korea are pulled like a magnet towards Myeongdong swayed by the tales of cosmetic freebies Sometimes I manage to talk them down but mostly they ignore the plain facts that the kinds of stores found there are on any high street in Korea and they all hand out freebies It is also bizarrely famous for its restaurants but if your scale of quality lends itself to overpriced overcooked overfancy then you are definitely in the right place,1
1191,1191,4.0,There is a lot to see and buy cant finish in a day You can find some similar items in different shops so compare before you buy Avoid taking free samples from cosmetics and skincare shops as most of them will literally pull you in to their shop and take back the free sample if you did not buy anything Food in Myeongdong streets are mostly overpriced Ask the price before purchasing food as some sellers would raise the price if they know you are travellers,1
1070,1070,4.0,Stayed at Myeongdong both 2 years ago and on our last trip Its a great base to be as its so lively and happening There are also a few exchange places so very convenient I am not big on shopping so wasnt interested in the cosmetic shops and the street food is quite samey and overpriced The best thing about it is the vibe and convenience in getting to other places the cable car to Namsan park is not too far away and its a short walk to Namdaemun It was nice to step out of our guesthouses and step straight into the energy of the area,1
1077,1077,4.0,Must visit for all beauty lovers Even if youre not interested in the cosmeticsskincare visit if you have the time just to soak in the ambience Would say beauty products are cheapest here often with masks going for Buy 1 get 1 or Buy 2 get 1 with lots of freebies  Nice street food though Id say they can get a little overpriced  Come with umbrella because when it rains there is no shelter besides the shops,1
5114,5114,5.0,This shopping district is perfect if you want name brand clothing from popular stores Zara Uni Qlo Top Ten Ten around the world Korean specific brands and even local boutiques where you can bargain which Id highly recommend Just make sure you put on your best poker face Also a great place to get street food though it will be overpriced,1
4687,4687,5.0,The whole strip of Myeondong offers a wide array of beauty shops which offer face masksa lot of them Nice place to experience the busy shopping spree while munching on slightly overpriced street food,1
3597,3597,5.0,If you like Korean cosmetics such as Etude House Face shop Aritaum Moonshot Skin food The saem etc try to go here as its one of the most complete cosmetics area and its good for tourist Most vendors here can speak korean well chinese well little english and little japanese Theres not many clothes and souvenirs here but theres a lot of street snacks at night The price of the street snacks are a little bit overpriced but if you dont really have other time to go to other place such as hongdae and sinchon this might be a good place for you to buy foods Theres zara uniqlo hm forever21 daiso top10 8seconds spao lotte young mall lotte duty free shinsege department store myeongdong cathedral myeongdong theater nanta theater Hahas restaurant Myeongdong Gyoza Kang hodongs bbq restaurant hello kitty cafe cat cafe dog cafe and many more,1
2447,2447,5.0,If you have never been to Seoul Myeongdong is probably the most happening shopping street you should go to  Getting there is easy by subway and you could make your way out of the station from exit 57 Exit 56 is where Shinsegae dept store is and it will lead you to the walking streets in Myeongdong as well  Along the streets there are many beauty brands sports brand fashion labels as well as accessories shops The shopping is endless and after awhile you probably noticed that there are more than 1 shop for each beauty labels at different parts of Myeongdong So if you cannot get what you want at 1 shop move on you probably see the same brand again later  There are also many food options and by late noon hawkers will start setting up their mobile food stalls along the streets Saw cheese lobsters going for 15000 won which i think is overpriced There were roasted chestnuts stall king prawns stall and fishcake stall as well  Actually Myeongdong is connected to Namdaemun market In the past when I visited Seoul I used to walk through Namdaemum market to Myeongdong and things at Namdaemum is slightly cheaper than Myeongdong For those who have alot of time on hand try walking from Namdaemum to Myeongdong for a better shopping experience,1
1241,1241,5.0,An entire area dedicated to beauty products with all the major beauty brands located here innisfree nature republic skinfood face shop balina co etc This is the place to buy all your facial products and makeup There is a Line theme shop in here too that is a mustgo place for absolute cuteness  Food and clothing stalls are set up at the centre of the street every night Food is pretty overpriced but they offer a good variety  This is also the place for good food if you know how to find it There is a famous dumpling shop here and there are great bbq and seafood places hiding in the lanes,1
3009,3009,5.0,Myengdong Shopping is a vibrant shopping and eating extravaganza The place to go for cosmetics lots of cosmetics Crowd watching is also fun Street food vendors offer an array of local food selection but in my opinion they are overpriced,1
1398,1398,5.0,the amazing thing about the shops are that the staff all speak mandarin a few may speak English The fashion stores are interesting and of course we have the cosmetic shops everywhere Some can do refund of tax on the spot which is really handy other require you to get it at the airport but not to worry the tax refund machines are found everywhere in the airport There is usually a person to help with the machines they are easy to use anyhow the night market is pretty fun but I reckon some of the trinkets are overpriced they are cheaper is the subway shops,1
3650,3650,5.0,Street food is overpriced and not that good Except for the Strawberries it costs around 7000 to 10000 krw Its very sweet and fresh Its Cheaper if you buy the one sold in a cup for just 3000 to 5000 krw Shop in artbox if you like cute and unique stuff Holika Holika etude innisfree the face shop is almost in every corner After shopping go to Myeongdong Kyoja Hands down serve they serve the best dumpling,1
