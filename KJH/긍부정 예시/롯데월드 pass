457,457,1.0,Visited this week and what a nightmare Expect  Lines we could count 1h for the train touring 2mins accross the main square or another 1h for the baby fairy boat Non working app  useless premium price paid could book 1 ride with the quick pass on the full day Amazing food system  want 1 coke 1 cofee and 1 ice cream to have all family happy  Queue 3 times in three outlets each time 10mins Indoor park   yep but as outside is 38 degrees each client stay in only and AC was not sufficient for the place and croud   Expectin a day to create memories got a day with nightmare and unhappy familly  just do not go there not worth a cent would not go back even if for free,0
379,379,1.0,I guess because its indoor there were more emphasis on VR rides and experiences Not the place to go if youre looking for thrill rides The queuing time was ridiculous  over a hour unless you have a magic pass The signs for the rides or the facilities are not clear I walked a full circle looking for the toilets to discover it was right where I was The stairs and escalators were hard to find going up or down a floor Some experiences you have to pay extra for and you dont know this unless you go up to it like the VR experience on B3 They had a tour pamphlet all in Korean with the ice rink in it and we thought it was part of Lotte World The park staff on B3 with very poor English so I think she said well be exiting the park and reentry is not permitted So to sum up Spent most of my time going around a big circle looking for stairs and elevators to go up or down a floor to go around in a circle to look for rides and experiences which takes a hour of queuing because people with magic passes takes priority so they take up the seats first,0

358,358,1.0,Came here with my sister on a Wednesday and it was packed with students No personal space during the line up will most likely get bumped Waiting time were minimum 2 hours  What foreigners need to know is that they have a lotte world adventure apps where u can reserve 3 rides per person We only knew about it at 11am and most of the rides were fully booked for all the slots Managed to book the pharaoh which was somewhat a fun ride Its called the magic pass reservation Be sure to reserve magic pass for the more trilling rides after getting your tickets We waited for the French Revolution for a whooping 35hours The ride lasted less than a minute and VR was working Not the best experience Never going again You will see the longest queue in your life Went there at 930am left at 8pm Managed to get on 5 rides only Not worth my time and money tbh Shouldve went to Everland People in their 20s should just go to Everland for more thrilling rides This place can be skipped for sure,0

338,338,1.0,Im writing this while still in the queue for our second ride We have been here for 4 and a half hours now I was afraid it could be crowded so we went on a Monday and I bought a 5x Magicpass which i could not use a single time because all seats have been booked out almost immediately for all attractions which are popular I think its only worth a visit if you are totally into waiting or if you come with children because the attractions for small children seem to have less waiting times,0
525,525,1.0,The park itself is ok Not huge but some good rides both indoor and outdoor Like some people who dont mind paying a bit extra for fast passes we paid for extra Magic Passes But using them proved impossible You have to download their app to make reservations These reservations close every time the very few slots have been allocated For a first timer with young family we did not realize that we need to literally stalk the app every 15 mins to secure those precious slots And for one reason or another the navigation is super unintuitive for the first couple of times Since the slots are gone literally 3 seconds after each time period opens its a race of fast fingers  Of our couple of hours there we couldnt get on that many And as the family leader I found myself being a slave to the stupid app rather than being able to fully enjoy myself  Would have asked for a refund for those unused stupid Magic Passes if staff could speak more English  Will not return,0
323,323,1.0,We went on a Friday after Memorial day holiday in Seoul May have been the most stupid time to go other than memorial day itself  I paid for 3 tickets on Kloop ticket collection was far away from the main entrance A good 1015min walk after asking 3 different people and added 5 magic passes to two of those tickets for an extra S100 What a waste of money The magic pass system is terrible Every 15 minutes the system opens to allow time slots to be booked to reserve the ride and skip the queue It has very limited number of time slots each hour and try as we might for 2 hours we could not reserve anything Each time the reservation started It showed all slots filledclosed about 10 seconds after it opened Eventually all time slots had been reserved and we had to queue with everyone else So that was 100 down the drain We didnt ride any of the popular rides because the queues were 90 to 110mins per ride We were there for 10 hours until closing time and rode 5 rides all day We thought Screw it lets pay extra to play the VR games But no Theres a height restriction and my girl was 5cm below it  Also the stupid parade that they run through the main indoor Adventure land around 2pm will section off large areas which cannot be crossed easily or at all during some parts of the parade So dont get separated or you wont be able to return until after the parade ends And all this online advice about going for the popular rides during the parade I found to be bull crap The queues were long and getting longer still  While my 10yr old enjoyed it as an adult  I wouldnt wish the experience on my worst enemy Only a parents love for his kids got me through this day  Just be prepared to queue Bring your tunes and your headphones battery pack for your phones a portable fan sweaty queues whether indoor or out snacks drinks and pack light There are plenty of lockers but they are single use so if you do use them then make sure you keep the important stuff with you One thing I wish I had was a collapsible stool You will stand for a long long time at Lotte World in queue after queue I saw some parent bring a picnic mat for the kids to sit and lie on She was a local with local knowledge  Food and beverage prices are not super expensive but nor are they cheap Expect to pay amusement park prices  I wish I could say something nice about Lotte World but I cant I just taste bitterness,0
507,507,1.0,We reached there at around 2pm and wanted to stay till the night as the park opens late for that day The day has been gloomy thus we have already expected all outdoor attractions to be closed Upon reaching we saw that most attractions had queues of 80min and up We proceeded to utilize the magic pass mobile app in hopes to snag a magic pass however the app was loading the whole time and could not even get us to the landing page  We went on to walk around the premises to see if there were attractions with shorter queue As we walked on the app finally loaded and we checked on waiting time to see a few attractions 015min wait Upon rushing it were we told that the ride was under maintenance which was why the app reflected such a short waiting time  The park had similar naming rides that we rushed in order to make it in time for the magic pass only to know that we were at the wrong location After an hour or so we so frustrated by whats happening that we went to the customer service counter to see what else Lotte World could offer We were shocked to know that at the point of our query only a total of 8 rides and they were all kiddie attractions or lesser were available as all the others were under maintenance  I cant imagine heading into a theme park and wanting out so badly due to what is happening We were there for 3hours 1 hour was spent on lunch and the remaining 2 was spent finding and getting rejected from rides The good thing out of the whole situation we managed to get on 1 ride which we thought were for adults but nope it wasnt,0
167,167,1.0, I bought the Magic Pass to get the benefit of skipping the line but even the Magic Pass is useless if it is lost in the rankings I have a magic pass but I cant use it ,0
757,757,2.0,This indoor theme park would probably be really enjoyable for children under 10 and their parents As two adults we found majority of the rides quite tame The rides that looked like they would be more appropriate for us had massive queues of over 2 hours on a weekday and the magic passes had all been used We used the discount coupon from the airport bus ticket but it still was an expensive day due to the limited appropriate rides,0
927,927,2.0,Looks great but were unfortunately disappointed at first it looks really exciting and spectacularly decorated but the rides are quite basic We experienced a situation here which never before has been experienced anywhere else in the world for us Both me and the person I was travelling with suffer some medical problems which mean its better to go back to the hotel for a rest and to take medication also wanted to look around the shops there and get something to eat We asked when buying a day pass that we needed to do this and the person at the counter said it was fine When we attempted to leave the staff refused to let us leave and said if we leave we wont be allowed back in unless we pay for another day pass They were unprofessional and rude and I was thinking it could be a language mistake so after multiple questions we demanded to see someone who could speak English fluently they confirmed this was the rule but this staff member was very friendly and arranged for us to be let in after we left it was a ridiculous rule as ive been to theme parks all over the world and never not been let out before Please keep in mind that this is an even more stupid rule because the indoor theme park is a part of a huge shopping complex and outside the gates are multiple food courts and restaurants inside the park is a very limited range of food or shops and is also more expensive The whole complex is owned by Lotte aswell so I dont know what the problem is in letting people out It seemed most of the locals had yearly passes so were allowed to come and go as they pleased  We first noticed on arrival that the staff were very unfriendly and rude some even look like life is so painful they would gladly be euthanized if given the option this was quite disappointing as we came here to have a happy day out at the end of a long trip but ended up being quite downbeat due to their attitude and poor organisation I was told that this was the Korean way though Disneyland is the happiest place on earth for a reason and this place doesnt come close  The park is very hard to find things you can see a ride that looks interesting but walk around for hours looking for the entrance to it Staff had no English skills mostly so wasnt any use to ask them Signage was really bad Especially bad that very little was in English aswell  Most of the more exciting rides were closed for maintenance or had extremely long lines so we were forced to go on the less popular ones The park is clearly a poor copy of a Disney park but it could be so much better with a little work We were adults but also noticed there werent many rides for younger children but the Sinbad ride was very good for all ages for people who dont like thrill rides but still want a little adventure with the drops and everything  The Parades were disorganised but interesting to watch I would recommend going to Lotteworld if its a less busy day and if you like theme parks definitely wouldnt attempt going here on the weekend or a public holiday  The guidebooks say to get off at a certain train station but again theres no signage to LOTTEWorld or any map or guide to say where it was or even where the entrance was was very confusing and we got there later than expected due to this  Unfortunately poor communication and organisation lets this park down in what could be a really amazing experience Part of what I liked about it was that it was a theme park in a new country so a new experience,0
359,359,2.0,We went there on a Monday in the morning But the amount of people queuing was unbelievable The waiting time was at least one hour up to 3hours The most popular rides have longer waiting time ofc During 6 hours spend there we took 3 rides total  You can buy a magic pass but that costs extra 100k and you cant use it on all rides And lets be honest 50 for the regular ticket is not so cheap  Also you have to pay extra for some of the ridesattractions  To sum up I dont recommend it neither will I go there again,0
423,423,2.0,We visited the park on a Saturday and it was very crowded and busy  without fast pass we had to queue about an hour for each ride We gave up after two rides  and went shopping at the lotte supermarket instead ,0

256,256,2.0,So we decided to book a ticket to lotte world during our vacation to Seoul but I was really disappointed about the park Having been to Disneylands I would say lotte world is not even close to being as good as Disneyland I was hyped at first at the entrance wondering about the fun rides the park is going to offer but eventually i was greeted with disappointment when i took a look at the park map Basically the only fun ride was the Atlantis roller coaster and nothing else is that good Plus the place was packed with local students and I had to queue for 3 hours just for the Atlantis ride and trust me it wasnt pleasant at all By the time we completed the ride it was already evening I would say theyre trying to emulate disneyland with the castle and stuffs but boy was i wrong as it wasnt even a fun experience at all Rides were below average some places were not covered with the 1 day pass and of course the massive crowd I dont blame the crowd but rather how small the park is to accommodate the large crowd,0
263,263,2.0,This amusement park is much more indoorcentric  and quite alot of the rides need extra payment which are not included in the entrance fee And the waiting time are really crazy even on a school day The outdoor park is quite small as well In short if you want to come here  I highly recommend you to get the Fast pass or else you would end up wasting alot of your time waiting,0
904,904,2.0,Lotte World looked better at first sight than it actually was First we arrived and had to pay 44000Won for a full day ticket My friend got a credit card discount and the ticket costed him 12 000Won it would be nice to know about those kind of discounts We got disappointed because the ticket itself wasnt a full pass you need to grab at least 30 000Won more to access everything in Lotte world such as Ice ring Magic jungle Horror house or something like that The amusement park rides looked pretty old from near distance also there wasnt many of them altogether Maybe 58 rides for an adult We skipped the rollercoaster right away because of 45min queue There were two nice rides so I wont give 1 star,0
609,609,2.0,Lotte World Adventure was advised as an amusement park that one should not miss when visiting Seoul After having paid KRW 26k for the one day pass  50 less then the advertised rate thanks to Thanksgiving  it felt more like going back in time  its mainly an indoor amusement park build on 3 floors around an ice skating ring The place looks old but certainly was great in the 70s Wanna ice skate  pay extra To make the place a little more contemporary  we are in high tech Korea right   a VR room and a Wild Jungle VR ride was added The VR ride was not really state of the art but well done and certainly one of the rides to do The Sindbad boat Ride was OK but not recommended for kids Looking for food dont be confused Several restaurants have a in and an outside Once you pass through the restaurant to the outside into the mall you actually left the Adventure Park and reentry is not allowed,0
81,81,2.0, It seems like the magic pass system needs to be reorganized but it is a manahan hopeful advisor ,0
1513,1513,2.0,The place is nice with great rides but only if you are patient enough to wait in the queue for an hour and a half per ride We felt like we are not getting much value for our money since we did not feel like spending the whole day standing in the queue In the evening some of the rides were closed even though the place was supposed to be open till late and for this reason the queues were equally long in the evenings Moreover you cannot leave the place and go shopping or do something else for a while and then go back your one day pass is not valid anymore if you leave the area There was no smoking area in the whole place,0
1393,1393,2.0,We went during peak season and there was so many people lining up for every single ride There are magic passes for three rides and you can reserve a time for quick access and avoid the queue However we found that most of the rides had their allocation exhausted and we couldnt use the magic passes Wait times were around 40100 minutes for the popular rides We got shortchanged buying the headbands from the stalls and the food is pretty bland and staff not particularly attentive or friendly,0
116,116,2.0,2 stars  Without magic pass 3 stars  With magic pass ,0
926,926,3.0,IMHO its better to go Lotte World during winter than Everland because its indoor park can be enjoyed throughly without freezing Nice place with many rides but the queues can be very long What I dont understand is some rides require you to pay to enter even though you have paid the day pass,0
746,746,3.0,We went on a Monday and didnt think the line looked that bad However there are multiple entrances so we didnt see all the people Even though I had installed the magic pass app by the time we found a locker and actually looked at the app the magic passes were already gone for conquistador the flume ride and the loop We went to the little kiddie land and there werent lines this is right at opening However any of the bigger rides were already at 45 minute wait We were so over the whole experience by lunch time It was cold out but the lines outside were also long I saw one line for flyventure at 190 minutes No thank you Lines just ruin my mood especially when you are with kids and came on a nonholiday weekday We also did Everland on our vacation and other than being farther from the city was so so much more enjoyable for us It was not a favorite on our 6 day trip,0

765,765,3.0,Seoul must go to amusement park to rival Disneyland Have most of the rides you would want including virtual reality and 3D 4D shows There is a large indoor area where around twothirds of the rides and attractions with the outdoor Magic Island accommodating the others We went on a public holiday in Korea where foreigners get a 50 discount but unfortunately We bought the day pass which was normally priced at KRW 52000 it was so crowded and queues typically had a waittime of between 23 hours crazy It was also stuffy and after a while inside we were dying for some fresh air We were there for only 4 hours and managed just one ride  the Fly Venture If you really want to enjoy the place best to plan ahead arrive really early in the morning If you dont like crowds especially packed indoors this is not the place for you The subway station for Lotte World is Jamsil Lines 2 and 8,0
695,695,3.0,It is a indoor and outdoor park  with rides food food and a mall It costs around 40 for a pone day pass but for some attraction you will need to pay more It did not make sense since we did choose the all day pass with inclusive of attraction The queue are long about 1h30 We went on a week day non holiday period,0

833,833,3.0,We visited Lotte World in April 2015 during our trip to Seoul The whole infrastructure is very impressive It is a huge complex with both indoor and outdoor facilities The rides were of high standard and offered some great excitement and are made of modern and quality materials Restaurants cafes and snack stallsstores are widely available and you dont have to walk far until you come across the next one  While everything is huge impressive and contemporary it seemed quite dull and lifeless to me There were some nice things to see but the overall experience was just boring to be honest Im sure its different for kids but there are theme parks that can excite even the dullest of adults  We also found the price to be quite steep the day pass was close to USD 5000 Should you decide not to take any rides their entry fee was still pretty hefty at USD 3100 for a day Seoul is such an exciting city if I knew beforehand about Lotte World I wouldnt have bothered and would have spent the money going someplace else,0
898,898,3.0,Chose Lotte World over Everland due to cold weather and that rides in Everland was not running 100 as the day temperatures were below 0C Distance was also a deciding factor and the fact that Lotte World boast to be the largest indoor theme park in the world attracted us to it  Fairly easy to get to the park via the Seoul Subway Ticketing and entry was relatively smooth Unknown to us the period when we were visiting coincided with the high school holidays thus resulting in very large numbers of teenagers Both the indoor and outdoor rides have an average waiting time of about 90 minutes with some going as long as 120 minutes Now here is the bad thing about Lotte World or any other theme parks in Korea Queue cuttingjumping is an accepted practice here I read about it on some theme parks forums but couldnt believe the extent or severity of it until I was there to witness it myself Example the person in front of you will at some point of time either by texting on their handphone or shouting at their friends will invite his or her friends to join him in the queue It could be as little as just one person to as much as 10 people This happens at all the rides and is rampant even with the theme park officials helping the queue jumpers get to their friend that was already in the queue It was simply unacceptable and appalling for nonKoreans visitors  On the way out meet a theme park official and gave them feedback on the problem of queue cuttingjumping The theme park was apologetic and understood my frustrations and offered another day of free entry as a form of goodwill gesture We took up the offer and faced the same problems the next day   Connected to the Lotte World is a shopping mall that offers quite an extensive selections of shops and eateries An alternative for those who wish to take a break from the theme park Take note though Lotte World entry passes does not allow for reentry after leaving the theme park area,0
1073,1073,3.0,This place as fun but the inside portion is mostly for children Also there are some rides that are not included pass you would have to pay extra There is a lot to do and see inside There is a food court there and several stands to get snacks The outside portion has some rides but not a lot The lines were extremely long If you go near halloween be prepared for zombies to chase you around,0
481,481,3.0,Indoor rides are limited as 3 popular rides were closed down with no reason provided Inconsistent with the staff service as some staff require tourists to present entrance pass documents before getting on the rides One of the level 2 rides the staff pushed my son away and dropped him on the ground for refusal entry when the passes were with my hubby in another ride with my daughter I found this attitude and service quite bad as a two yrold child was excited for the ride and being treated in this manner Not as if the ride having long Q I explained that we will show the pass tickets later after the ride as my child is crying with disappointment after such treatment,0
624,624,3.0,First off this is nothing on the scale of Disney which it seems to want to replicate Magic Island in place of Magic Kingdom marching bands and cute characters wandering about for photos The park is good but perhaps a little pricey for what it is The rides are on the same scale as say Legoland Dont expect anything that will leave you wanting to ride again There are some food outlets which vary in quality The high points are the water log ride the Zombie VR area and the Korean Heritage area There is a huge shopping mall attached which should suit every need Annoyingly you would need a more expensive day pass to be able to enter the park then leave to go shopping then reenter later on even though its all the same Lotte complex As the title says this is definitely not a must see place I only went on my second visit to Seoul but if you have a spare day on your itinerary and you like theme parks then perhaps this would be a good idea Try and find a discount coupon as a foreigner youll get 20 off for up to 4 adults,0
1003,1003,3.0,Went on a Thursday some rides were undergoing maintenance DO CHECK THE APPWEBSITE BEFORE GOING the rides which were down were some of the main rides long queues for the comet express  french revolution 100 mins there is the magic pass app where you get to try your luck to get an express pass at a specific time slot you can do it at the kiosk too The day I went there were many students there making it crowded  almost 90 were students which was really different from my Everland experience  Food selection was decent its not super big but its good and the location is still in the city which makes it convenient and its near lotte mart for food shopping,0
984,984,3.0,The main attractions were closed however there was no notice when we purchased tickets Waiting time is up to 90 min so suggest to buy a magic pass Good for children up to 14 maybe Mine were 1416 so not really interested,0

599,599,3.0,Most of the popular rides waiting time is at least 3040mins and we went there on a Wednesday There is an outdoor and indoor theme park similar to Genting Highlands theme park Do take note that admission tickets are for single admission only once you exit the theme park reentry is not allowed We bought the one day pass via Changi Recommend website which is significantly cheaper as compared to the original price,0
420,420,3.0,If you have recently visited Disneyland I would say dont come here The place is small and crowded The queues are long and sometimes they cut off the magic passes Do not pay the full price if you decide to go Use sites like Trazy or Klook and get your discount passes foreign passport holders only The kids had a fun time but for adults not so much The only saving grace for us was that we did get some nice photos of the kids Also do go early and avoid weekendsholidays if you can,0
863,863,3.0,We went to the Lotte World on Sunday and bought the after 4 special pass tickets since it was cheaper We pay for only 26000 won instead of 46000 won for full day pass As expected the place was packed with people esp some local teenagers Luckily the queueing was acceptable 2030 mins for indoor games and we had the opportunity to enjoy almost all of it However the queueing was crazy long for the outdoor games 5090 mins and we only managed to enjoyed the lame swing tree ride  There is a big carnival parade around the central before the park closed it was pretty fun with lots of people in colourful costumes dancing around Overall it was a good place to having fun and pretend youre in Disneyland,0
1232,1232,3.0,My 2nd visit to Lotte World and this time I booked tickets on weekdays hoping itll not be crowded like all theme parks I was wrong the place is bustling with students and young couples even on a Monday The queue for outdoor rides is worst The snake long queue has at least more than 50 pax for each ride   Theres a queue on almost all the rides even the indoor monorail ride Be prepared to wait at least 45 mins for a 5 mins ride Downloaded the fast pass app and its doesnt work The only consolation is that theres a prayer room and halal kebab food in Lotte World,0
4,4,3.0,Its good for a one time visit The waiting time is too long so I advice to buy the express pass otherwise youll have to wait like 1 hr per game,0
258,258,3.0,Visited on Tue 17 December 2019 Waited 15 hour for French Revolution VR They should remove VR when it is not VR Should have gotten the magic pass for this Luckily this roller coaster ride is quite fun with a 360 degree turn Only family rides have shorter queues around 5 to 1p minutes,0

1529,1529,3.0,Lotte World is divided into three parts Lotte World Adventure Lotte World Waterpark and Lotte World Aquarium I went to Lotte World Adventure and it consist of four levels of indoor adventures and linked to an outdoor theme park called Magic Island No doubt some of the rides were the main attractions there but the day went I visited was peak and it was a Monday They have two types of tickets Daily Passport Ticket full day and after 4pm admission and Admission Only Ticket full day after 4pm and after 7pm admission It gets cheaper for later passes I advise you to purchase onsite to prevent any mistakes because it includes admission to some other parts like the museum where I dont know where it that plus you might be give tourists discounts  During March to April they feature the Mask Festival where its a world of fantastic masks along with the vibrant spirit of spring plus a Masquerade parade at selected timings The worse part of the trip was most of the rides had to stop at 8pm for fireworks for 30mins That also means youll be in the queue before 8pm and queue for 30mins  1hour or whichever the waiting time for the ride What frustrates me even more was the staff stopped me from entering and explained to me that theres fireworks but yet allowed Koreans to enter the queue though theres communication barrier but actions spoke louder than words That staff even screamed at me as he have to repeat multiple times that I have to wait after 830pm Bad service  Read up on my Korea trip on httpnkikichuablogspotsg201408wanderlustseoulkoreaday7coexmallhtml,0

319,319,3.0,Good to spend a day in the theme park but nothing more even if you cannot cover everything We bought the 1 day pass with 5 times express credits Managed to use most on more popular rides and most are located in the outdoor section  Disappointed that a few exciting rides are undergoing maintenance work To be honest been to much much better theme park with fantastic rides  Remember there is no reentry unlike many other theme Parks Like those in Singapore Australia and Japan etc  A good experience but not a must come,0
321,321,3.0,If you want to have an experience of Korean theme parks with lots of Korean people around give it a try But if youre a theme park fanatic Id give it a miss I also found it disappointing that pretty much every outdoor ride shuts down when it rains I understand safety must come first but it was disappointing to have bought a fast pass and not be able to ride any of the rides I wanted to Im glad I went just to see it but I wouldnt go back,0
1544,1544,3.0,very confusing disorganized and disappointing Most announcements and signs are not repeated in English some attractions include stories or set phrases well well never know There are a lot of games and attractions that are not included into 1 day pass it gets frustrating when you already get excited about going somewhere and it requires separate ticket line and payment A bit too much food places as well but it is understandable  food is everywhere anyway  All in all its worth seeing if you have some time and money to spend and arent much of adrenalin junkie The park had its own special features and has very nice and elaborate decorations,0

1578,1578,3.0,Admission price is quite pricy need to buy tickets each time you ride so it can be cheaper to purchase 1 day passif you have little kids they will enjoy this magical world but can really be boring for adultSpend half a day here only This atrraction has direct access to green line subwayeasy to lcate and connected to lotte dept storeWord of adviceremember the entrance we spent 30 minutes jst to find the exit not much sign around,0
385,385,3.0,Today is Christmas eve I expected the lotte world will be very crowded therefore I bought the ticket for my kids with unlimited magic pass but when we try to reserve the ride most of the hot attraction magic pass reservation already closed it mean you cannot use magic pass for this attraction End up they need to spend time Q at normal queue I regret to bough the pass because is not cheap For my self self I bought 5 times magic pass and now is 5pm and I only manage to use one still has balance 4,0
1246,1246,3.0,Went for their Halloween night on the 31st October Its very crowded and not worth it to pay for the 1 day pass after 5pm The special are performers dressing up as various monsters and 4 existing rides painted or decorated in Halloween themes,0
1588,1588,3.0,Id suggest anyone everyone to just head to Everland if you have a day to spare in a theme park Me and my friends we spent the whole day in Everland without getting bored and amazed but it was purely zzz throughout our stay at Lotte World Its small and theres nothing much to see Just felt that Lotte is overrated Everland is just so much better okay it took us hours to get to Everland from Seoul so I guess if you want convenience Lotte World will be a better choice Spent not more than 4 hours in Lotte World before we head out haha If I didnt remember wrongly the ticket was cheaper than Everland though And they gave us student price despite us being foreigners and we did not have student pass with us and some meal voucher which we exchanged for a free meal yay Haha so we didnt felt that bad afterall,0
1308,1308,3.0,You know how a Samsung phone is fine if thats all you have but the design and interface pales in comparison to an iPhone Lotte World is like that compared to a Disneyland experience Its modeled after Disneyland but is an obvious fake but entertaining to see nonetheless  We managed to visit with an online 50 off deal for foreign passport holders for 24000 Won each about 20 USD So for that price it was a fine thing to do The wait for rides was 6090 minutes in the heat with nothing to look at not like at Disneyland where the lines are even an immersive part of the ride  Atlantis was a great ride that we did twice French Revolution was so jarring that it gave us all mild concussions The wait for the hot air balloons and the Comet Express were 70 minutes so we skipped those We knew we were visiting Tokyo Disneysea a few days later so we felt we had all gotten our 20 worth and called it a day after 3 rides that took about 5 hours to complete  So if this is the only amusement park you can get to its fine But if you have other experiences Lotte World is fine only if you can get a big discount and have teenagers you need to appease for a day,0
1480,1480,3.0,Big and lots of attractions for every age The signage is not very clear so you might get lost easily Staffs not able to communicate much in English Some restaurants inside are terrible If you buy a daypass ticket doesnt mean youre able to exit and enter again which is bad,0
1468,1468,4.0,We visited Lotte World at the end of our Seoul trip and really enjoyed it Aim to get there at opening time as it gets much busier later in the day We visited on a week day and managed to fit in around 15 rides as opposed to Everland where we only did 6 due to long lines The food options were quite diverse and reasonably priced Lotte World has a quick pass system on some rides so make sure you take advantage of it,1
910,910,4.0,Been there on my recent Summer trip in August Was there from abt 11am 930pm  It was a rather gloomy morning with slight drizzle so it wasnt too crowded  Took the Gyro Drop and Alantis outdoor rollercoaster with a 15min queue Then watch some Kpop highschool musical show and some parade  The crowd started streaming in after lunch hour and queues started to form  Took the French Revolution indoor roller coaster after a 45min queue  then roamed around more took ALL the rides we passed by and left after the Laser Show   these rides are the most worth it if youre into highspeed twist and turns if you scream during a viking ride you should give them a miss lol,1
1226,1226,4.0,We went on a Saturday and started off with the outdoor rides Just 2 rides have already spent 4 hrs queuing Many rides and attractions both indoor and outdoor but the long queue requires lots of patience and self entertainment while queuing Downloaded the Apps for Quickpass but it is useless as it is always full every 15 mins Not recommended for weekend,1
876,876,4.0,We went there on monday morning to avoid the big crowds Still there were a lot of people and the crowd got bigger in the afternoon We did some less frequented attractions indoor first but I advise to do the popular stuff first outdoor Atlantis Balloon ride and maybe reserve one of the popular ones with the magic pass to get fast access we did not try it but it should be possible We went there as a couple and there is something to do for every age group Some thrill rides something for smaller children and romantic rides as well Its not nearly as goodbig as disney world and the like but still we had a lot of fun As most of the attractions are indoor its good alternative on a day with bad weather in our case it was really hot so we were always happy to get back to the AC If its raining the outside part might be closed,1
1434,1434,4.0,We were lucky enough to be in Seoul close to Thanksgiving and they had a 2 week foreigner special 50 off tickets So we went to check it out Definitely a cool place Not too many adult rides but theres some good ones  but be prepared to wait an 1hr for some but try to get some magic passes Pretty cool to see the inside with the multiple floors  the largest indoor theme park in the world The outdoor area is also really nice Some rides we really liked were the balloon ride french revolution and Atlantis pharaohs fury was unfortunately closed and the flume ride was too long of a wait Probably wouldnt have come if we had to pay full price but had a great time  Also with your ticket you get free entrance into the folk museum on the 3rd floor Actually really cool and they have a miniature village section with great models Not too many people visit the museum but def worth checking out,1
822,822,4.0,When we were in Seoul we wanted to do an amusement park We were told there were two good ones and this one was better for younger kids Since we had an 8 year old that enjoys roller coasters we thought itd be better to do this one and if we came back in the future to do the other park We had a great time here  We took the subway and it was very easy to walk there from the station This park is about 23 inside and 13 outside We did most of the inside and only a few of the outside as it was raining and when its wet they close the outdoor coasters They did open them in the afternoon but not all and we didnt get to do everything  Inside there are 4 floors On the top is an Egyptian ride we liked probably best of all with lots of cool replicas and stuff and a hot air balloon ride which went around the entire inside part It was a cool view and there was a special tunnel part but the wait was crazy long  On the 3rd floor was the monorail but it was closed because of the rain And another ride called Jungle Adventure The 2nd floor has a fast roller coaster and bumper cars  The 1st floor had most of the rides from a swinging boat a water ride with a big splash carousel and a ride with a 360 on it There was a ride called Drunken Basket which was like the mad hatter tea cups at Disneyland  Below the 1st floor you could see a big ice skating rink but we did not go down there I cost extra  Outside was one of those ride where you site in a big ring around a tower that goes all the way to the top and then drops you I hate those in your seat and goes partially back up and does it again a few times There were two coasters that were closed a walk through ghost house a ferris wheel magic show and more One part of the haunted house scaredupset my son a little bit with a cat becoming a ghost There was also a big castle you could walk through outside  There were several showsperformances with people in costumes They seemed geared toward little under 6 crowd on the first floor There was a tram that came through and there were ladies hanging off the side like Vegas show girls very sparkly with exotic outfits The park has two main mascots Lotty and Lorry and their faces and likeness were on lots of things throughout the park There were some animatronics  They park did have a fast pass type thing called Magic Pass to get a ticket to go to the front of the line at a later time You constantly had to show your admission ticket to ride things since they have an all day unlimited and a like 10 ride pass I lost mine but they didnt make a big deal about replacing it though they said I only get one replacement  There were a lot of food options with a good amount of variety actually You could get Korean food hotdogs pizza burgers Chinese kebabs and more The food we got wasnt amazing but it wasnt bad either  There were lots of shops to buy things at and we bought some cat ear headbands that my son loved so much he wore the rest of our trip in Korea  Our visit was such a very fun day If you have kids under 13 this is a great place to go,1
804,804,4.0,We went to Lotte World on a beautiful October day in Seoul Our guesthouse Mmmio house highly recommended was close to a subway station and from there it took us about half an hour to get to Lotte World on the other side of the river which splits Seoul in two parts Upon arrival at the Jamsil station green line 2 by subway the signs direct you immediately to the Lotte Department Store and other Lotte things to dosee including Lotte Adventure World As we prefer not to wait in line we were excited to see ticket machines which also displayed information in English After having tried all of them we asked staff why the English version on the machines did not work and were told that the machines are not for foreigners Staff very nicely directed us to the counter to buy tickets Second in line suddenly the counter closed and we were directed to another line This was not nice but ok since only about 6 people were waiting in front of us now After half an hour  waiting we could finally buy our ticket but were asked for our passports Not being made aware by anybody that we needed passports I luckily realized that I had a residence card from another country with me A few discussions later with different staff we were allowed to buy four tickets The cost USD 150 seemed high It was a fairly quiet day in the park so the waiting for most attractions was not bad The park has three or four levels and from each level you can see the levels below There is also an outside area with more attractions The park is in the middle of the city and it is quite amazing how they have used the limited space to build so many attractions Although we had tickets which allowed us to access all attractions we did have to pay for one attraction the Tomb of horror or something like that It is approx USD 25 per person Everland is a more recently opened amusement park and bigger than Lotte Adventure World but further away Early 2016 a brand new amusement park will be opened,1
767,767,4.0,Went during Lunar New Years Day Super busy as foreigners nonKoreans got 40 discounts Always research for discounts as LotteWorld has specials We got a combo deal with the Lotte Tower aquarium So we did both the LotteWorld and aquarium on the same day Its a great indoor park when the weather is not so nice hot or cold Its like a miniDisneyland and it has many large scale rides for adults and children Theres lockers for 1000 won about 1 USD when you get in the park to stash all your jackets and bags Theres some ride you have to pay additional when you get in Theres fast pass type magic pass system and you can use your phone app to scan your ticket and select rides you want to reserve the magic pass Its pretty simple and you use one phone for all your family members If you have children and you are traveling in Seoul its worth trying out,1
766,766,4.0,We went to Lotte World on the 21st of Dec which was a Wed We arrived just after 1200pm We bought a one day ticket for three adults 54000 won each We went inside and were impressed by the color and rides and decorations it looked so much fun But unfortunately it was really busy with a wait time for over 2 hours for most rides We were able to use the express pass app for a couple of less interesting rides but the best rides were already sold out We left at 600pm and only managed 3 rides and saw a bit of a show I am not sure if we came on a unusually busy day but I would recommend if you are going plan to be there early in the morning and hopefully you will have better luck than us,1
1548,1548,4.0,we visited this theme park on saturday and it was really crowded there was long queue but the location is in seoul and not too far for dongdaemun where i stayed i just tried 23 attraction watched the show this theme park is divided into outdoor and indoor areafor adrenalin junkies this theme park will be dissapointed because not too many thrilling rides most of them in outdoor area the interior is larger than the exterior and nicer you can buy ticket for admission ticket just for visit or day pass ticket you can try most of rides visit museum but you have to pay another ticket to visit pororo park or night time day pass ticket usually for foreigner there is discount ticket to visit this park just check the website for discount coupon or some visit korea website but you cant buy the ticket from machine if you want to use your discount coupon no need to queue if you buy ticket from machine this theme park is connected with mall hotel there is duty free in up floor ticket just for one visit only once you exit from the park you can go back except you buy another ticket,1
1522,1522,4.0,We went on a Saturday and the queues were very long Magic passes helped Would probably have enjoyed it more if there were shorter lines for the rides The big thrill rides were too brief for me and were over too soon Didnt bring kids with me this time but kids would really love this place Good food also,1
1535,1535,4.0,PLEASE NOTE I went in Feb 2013 but didnt write the review until Aug 2014wasnt able to select date in the area where I tell when I visited as too much time had passed since my visit  I wasnt sure what to expect of this placemy brother lives in Incheon and we were visiting him for a week and he wanted to take us there Partly because he wanted to go because he loves amusement parks but partly because he also wanted to show us the madness that is Lotte World As I said I wasnt sure what to expect so the closest thing I can describe it to is Camp SnoopyNickelodeon World at the Mall of America in Bloomington MNexcept that Lotte World has both indoor and outdoor attractions whereas CSNW is purely indoors The place was PACKEDI think we were there during a school break weekand the line for every ride was at least 3 hours long so I didnt ride anything but instead just walked around my dad and brother went on one ride while I sat and read a book drank a soda etc I can see how this would be entertaining for familieschildren who live in Seoul and this is as close to Disney as they can get All of the rides and characters were blatant ripoffs of Disney charactersattractions but that just added to the kitsch factor so I was entertained by it all  It was easy to find easy to buy tickets plenty of beveragefood options in the park Just dont expect to be blown away if you have been to Disney LandWorld alreadyits not the same But it is still entertaining and a fun place to peoplewatch at,1
1350,1350,4.0,Firstly pop on Google play store and download the app This is essential as when u get your tickets you can scan them in and it gives you booking slots to reserve places using a sort of que jump system to get on some busy rides quicker You get a limited number of these but that could save you an hour of queing when it gets busy  If youre not Korean suggest take passports with you as we found a half price offer for foreigners so we got in 2 4 1  You can buy day tickets easily at the ticket desks  Theres a mix of rides varying from rollercoasters to the very impressive Gyro Swing Some of the rides youd expect to be a bit worse arent the aladdin one log flume jungle ride bungee and some of the roller coasters are actually more severe possibly being designed for smaller average height people they dont always have the best neck support for taller people Overall though nothing to complain about We enjoyed ourselves throughly  Didnt check re the ice skating if you have to book in advance assuming so Massive rink in the centre of the bottom floor  Earlier in the day is much quieter than midday to evening Use fast passes sparingly or later on when it gets busy  Loads of little street food type stalls around that compares favourably to the uk on price for our theme park food plus lots of small restaurants on site Staff are friendly and helpful,1
1388,1388,4.0,Even though there are long lines and a lot of people I really enjoyed coming here with my friends No Im not being sarcastic My friends and I talked a lot and got to know more things about each other while waiting in line It was quite fun And we got to ride a lot of rides They were really fun especially French evolution Gyro Spinswingdrop and the Atlantis By the way since these attractions are the most popular I recommend you come early in the morning when theres not as much as people and wait in line or get a fast pass And for the people whod rather shop than go to an amusement park they can skate at the ice rink or shop at Lotte department store Coming here was a fun but tiring let me tell you that experience and I wish go back there soon,1
759,759,4.0,LotteWorld has four levels of rides and in addition there is a massive outdoor area which comprises of massive rides I went with a friend and although we couldnt try everything it is definitely something that a young adult could still enjoy I recommend you to prepurchase your ticket at least 2 days as per requirement from online as you could save as much as 35 Need your passport However there is a downside Massive queues And when i say massive i mean average 1hr wait and this was on a Tuesday and not school holiday period If you are willing to spend some more money get the magic pass It allows you to jump queues Also make sure you bought the Allday passport as it allows you to go on any rides,1
1248,1248,4.0,From Myeondong cathedral we passed by Lotte market Did shopping again Very cheap and affordable Lot of items for selection Big shop mall You can find everything that you can buy as presents going bck to your own home country You can also just enjoy window shopping if you dont have more than enough of ur budget Accessible in the main streets and to take train Always drop by this Lotte mall for shopping Its tax free or duty free tax shopping mall just present your passport,1
1169,1169,4.0,Never pay full price for entry tickets if youre a foreigner There are a number of ways to get cheaper entrance tickets and we used Funtastic Korea voucher received 45 discount Despite it saying need 12 days before getting a confirmation email I received this within 10 minutes just ensure bookings are open on the day you want to visit Follow the entry instructions and make sure you take the passport in which the voucher was registered  Lotte World itself is crazy busy at any time Suggest you get there as early as you can Queues can be lengthy Download the Lotte World app to receive three magic passes for quicker entry to your selected rides though wait times can still be more than two hours  The five year old loved his age appropriate rides Yes there is a height restriction and as long as above 110cm then they are allowed on most of the kiddy rides They measure you pretty much at each ride there are a few allowing 90cm,1
1272,1272,4.0,So we decided after venturing to the Aquarium to try out the adventure world it is definately a place where everyone goes its in the place to be  Warning the weekends best to avoid think all locals come down for a great time and its a great time but be prepared for the very long queues but you can purchase a Maxi pass thats like a jump the queue,1
1280,1280,4.0,Had fun there using the magic pass which is a must too bad I only had two We really enjoyed the folk museum It was great to see Korea historically and to learn about the country Due to the time we went we didnt get a chance to see the outside nevertheless it was great as an overall I would definitely go again,1
1284,1284,4.0,Even before i visited this place that time i was excited but the ticket was too pricey this time i purchased ticket to master card i discounted to 20 even free pass tickets i really enjoyed this time I did not play much because of the rain but so happy,1
1098,1098,4.0,I went during the summer when school was off so there was quite a lot of people But the best thing was the magic passes Even though some of the lines were long by planning ahead I was able to rid on quite a number of attractions before the end of the day One downside was the hot weather So be careful if you go during the summer,1
1298,1298,4.0,It was amazing to see all the attractions inside 4 stories It was still a little warm  Korean ac  but beats being outside all day We went on a Monday and it wasnt too crowded and we downloaded the app but the fast pass only takes a limited number of people for the day and we couldnt ride any of the really popular rides  didnt want to wait for 2 hours It is small enough to do in a day and not wear yourself out My family ages 14 to 7 years had fun Although my 7 year old was too tall to ride the little kids rides The food was good and very reasonably priced We got our tickets in advanced through Trazycom,1
947,947,4.0,My sons enjoyed this amusement park although we found most of the rides were either very kiddyish or too wild There isnt a lot in between Still they enjoyed the flume ride drunken basket spin Tree Swing monorail aeronaut balloon ride and theatre shows  It was quite chilly when we visited so we spent more time indoors than outdoors That was what attracted me to this amusement park in that we could do something indoors away from the cold and that it was also accessible by the Seoul Metro Jamsil station  Toilets were clean Wish there was better variety of food apart from burgers hot dogs and candy floss Seems to be a lot of junk food on sale  We purchased one day passes which allowed us unlimited number of rides Games require an additional charge  Would we visit again Once is enough Probably will try a different amusement park next time we visit but the weather has to be right,1
1058,1058,4.0,Lotte World is a really wellmade park we went there with our family on a Friday and it really wasnt that crowded compared to other theme parks  We got the 5ride magic pass wristband and I can tell you that it is totally worth it For some of the rides they let us enter from the exit and enter the ride from there  Overall the scenery was ok but some of the rides had a really nice atmosphere to them Dragon shooting and Phahoras Fury were just a few examples of rides that everyone in your family could enjoy ,1
1307,1307,4.0,Before you go check out Lotte Worlds website for discount coupons We saved almost 50 on our admission fee The coupon said we had to have our passports to show we were foreigners but they never checked for them We took 3 kids 11 12 13 with us and they really enjoyed themselves There were rides and activities for everyone to enjoy We went midweek to avoid longer lines and I think that was a good call Our longest wait was 45 minutes for the big roller coaster We were annoyed that outside several of the big rides were closed This was not advertised and was disappointing Unlike parks in North America our bags were not searched for food so we were able to carry in some healthy snacks We bought lunch and ice cream inside at pretty reasonable prices Bathrooms are nice water in taps and fountains is potable The park has a lot to offer but is pretty compact which is nice as were werent totally exhausted from long walks between rides This is a wholeday outing Its really easy to access from the subway,1
1006,1006,4.0,What a fun day at Lotte World So many rides and lots to see It is difficult to navigate around There is so much packed in that you dont see all the rides unless you go down every street and every corner It is really tough to find the stairs or escalators as well Lines arent long but the wait to get on a ride takes forever They could introduce more efficientcy by counting passengers while the ride runs and limiting the number of Magic Passes allowed on a ride We went on a Monday and not a super busy day but wait times were 4560 for the more popular rides,1
1339,1339,4.0,Amazing place So huge Better to download the app for getting fast pass because the lines are very long,1
1002,1002,4.0,Went on a Wednesday morning but it was so packed with Korean teenagers many in school uniform It makes me wonder if that was a school excursion or it is a trend to visit theme Parks in school uniforms  We reached there exactly at 930am and when the doors were opened teenagers starting sprinting towards the rides and queues began to form  Not intending to wait too Long for rides we each paid 40000 won for the 5 rides express pass The counter for express pass is located behind the famous Carousel ride A paper band will be tied around your wrist Just show the band to the personnel at the express ride queue and they will mark on the wrist band Choose to use the wrist band wisely Some rides have queues that move quite fast Eg the pirate ship ride which allows 60 riders or more per rid so one should not use the wrist band here The express pass is really useful for rides that have queues up to 1h Long Atlantis and French Revolution have Super Long queues and these are reall high intensity fun rides Use your express pass here Gyro Swing is another ride which has ridiculously Long queue  Dont forget to go to level 23 where there is a photography area with many feature walls to take nice instragammable photos,1
996,996,4.0,Lotte World is a large indoor theme park covering multi stories and including an outdoor area The rides range from kiddie rides through to relatively large roller coasters that older kids will love If youre coming in winter be prepared to layer on and off if youre going to be in or outside  Best to arrive first thing when the crowds are small and queues are short  go to the most popular rides first  Atlantis French Revolution Pharaohs Rage etc otherwise be prepared to queue for up to 2 hours when the crowd builds up especially in the holiday season  The park is clean and well presented and offers a Disneyeque feel complete with their own Snow White Castle  The entry ticket we got 20 off using MasterCard is generally all inclusive a small handful of rides require extra payment There is a range of food from local to western Prices are generally higher than outside  There is a Lotte World app that can book Magic Passes like Disney fast passes but we couldnt get them to work perhaps they need to be booked first thing So suggest some preplanning is essential to get the best out of the park,1
995,995,4.0,Avoid at Christmastime Great place to visit but queuing for 2 hours for most rides took the shine off I dont know how much a magic pass is but I think it would be worth investigating to go to the front of every line,1
1344,1344,4.0,The general admission ticket is only for entrance watch shows and take pics  Rides not included You should buy the day pass ticket to include all the rides  If you have 2 yrs old kid They are free in 3 kinds of rides  So they can ride in all rides  Pay 12000 won We as family 2 adults 1 6yr old and 1 2 yr old paid 146000 won for day passes  Unlimited rides No lines on sundays,1
972,972,4.0,Came on a week day but there were loads of people glad we took the tickets with the magic pass and saved a lot of time from queueing overall had a great time,1
1030,1030,4.0,Very crowded on the weekend My 6 years old did enjoyed it as we changed plan from a private city tour to half city half Lotte world day because it was too hot to walk around palaces and other tourist spots I felt the indoor amusement park could have been cooler but with the outside heat and too many peoples inside made the AC seem it wasnt working well Lines are long minimum 30 minutes wait Wish I bought the magic pass that could of save us lots of time Final thought been there done that and will not come back,1
1222,1222,4.0,We went to Lotte World last Dec 24 As expected there were long lines before you can take the ride Waiting time is around 60 minutes for a 5 minute ride There are attractions that you have to pay extra even if you get an all day pass My 9 year old son was able to get in 5 attractions because of the long queue He decided to do ice skate instead,1
1619,1619,4.0,Try the Hot air balloon ride for full view of the park The indoor and outdoor games were soooo scary the 360 degree rollercoastergiant drop etc  The entrance fee will be much cheaper after 4 pm and youll get discount if you show your travel passportvisa,1
753,753,4.0,Im going again next week and itll going to be my 4th time there Ive joined tours to Korea before and every time the weather goes bad our tour guide will bring us to Lotte World instead of following our schedule to Everland Cause theres more indoor attraction  It does seems small inside but the attractions were BOOOMM It is really fun and if you know how to get magic pass you can literally play everything in a day Outdoor is LIT too HAHAH cause theres this game called Gyro Drop freefall experience Youll be experiencing zero gravity for 23seconds You wont know when youll fall so take a real deep breath,1
563,563,4.0,Do your homework Like how to use the fast pass where are the machines to make the reservations or download the apps ahead of time Otherwise you will waste a lot of time forming line We went from 11am3pm I would actually recommend going earlier to avoid the crowd,1
549,549,4.0,Lotte world is the fifth tallest building in the world and the third in Asia Ita mall that has many shops franchise restaurants and activities Also you can get you taxe back in the lotte department store 1st floor It a great place for kids they get to discover the lotte world adventure where you have many games and attractions to enjoy with your kids also you have an indoor and outdoor park So if its too cold for you outside yoh can still enjoy the indoor one But if you have a baby like us dont get the ticket entry with games pass get only the ticket for entry to the park,1
541,541,4.0,Had a fun afternoonevening with friends  A few tips  Tickets are normally 55000 won but you can get discounted tickets on Klook for 28000 won with the option to get the Magic Pass x 3 or 5 for an additional 22000  34000 won  which I would highly recommend  If you do buy tickets on Klook you enter via the South gate  The Magic Pass lets you skip the queue which most of the main rides had a wait time of 15  2 hours  Dont download the app to try and reserve a spot on the ride to skipqueue thing and dont try and use the Magic pass Kiosk  the app kept crash and only let you book in 15 minute slots which filled up pretty quickly and the same with the kiosks   The rides for the magic pass would say close but when we walked up to try and use our ticket the attendant will mark off your ticket let you straight though  winner after mucking around with the app and kiosk for quite some time,1
444,444,4.0,Very crowded on the weekend My 6 years old did enjoyed it as we changed plan from a private city tour to half city half Lotte world day because it was too hot to walk around palaces and other tourist spots I felt the indoor amusement park could have been cooler but with the outside heat and too many peoples inside made the AC seem it wasnt working well Lines are long minimum 30 minutes wait Wish I bought the magic pass that could of save us lots of time Final thought been there done that and will not come back,1

291,291,4.0,We went in at 10 am which was the opening time but there was already a long queue in front of entrance Soooo many students since it was summer holidays  We knew what we wanted to go for so ran to French revolution as soon as we entered One of the most popular rides We rode within 10 mins and went on to next one Pirates ship managed to ride within 15 mins  We tactfully chose the rides with shorter queue and could ride many rides for the first few hours It was possible because I am very familiar with rides and how to go about If you are to come in in the afternoon I strongly suggest 2 ways to shorten your queue time  I am not talking about buying ridiculously expensive fast passes Something you can do for free  Lotte world uniquely offer 3 fast access using their own App Magic pass App Of course you will want to have more than 3 passes since there are many popular ones but better than nothing  You first need to scan or manually register your entrance tickets on App Press reserve ride Each ride opens up every 15 mins to choose time slot Within seconds slots will be gone It is difficult to explain here Once you try to use App you will get the hang of it soon  If you are not very technical person or have slow finger I would suggest another way Know what you want to ride and go there At each entrance of ride you will see ticket reservation machine Simply scan your ticket then it will give out next available time slot Bring that paper at given time and go to fast pass way  Only downside of this method is you need to physically go to ride and scan your tickets If your 3 rides are all scattered around you need to walk around so much I suggest you to choose 3 rides relatively close to each other  Atlantis French revolution pirates ship and gyro drop are the musttrys There were 3 horror houses but I didnt try since my 2 kids were too scared to go in The most popular one was at magic island which is outdoor Its a shame that you need to pay 5000 won to go in  There are many variety of restaurants to choose from Korean Japanese Chinese and burgersetc Many stalls sell Lottel world goods and desserts  Lotte world rides can entertain from toddlers to teenagers They have more indoor rides than outdoor ones Perfect for rainy days We stayed until 4 pm and rode most of the rides using App and reservation machines Without a plan you could wait for hours for each ride so plan well ahead,1
503,503,4.0,This place is full of people Waiting time goes from 60mins to 240mins for French Revolution VR It is a very tiring day of waiting as most theme parks are  My tip will be to download their MagicPass app Go to setting and change the language Register your tickets For us we had 3 magic passes included with our tickets Then from there you can book your magic pass for 3 rides You can also view the waiting time for the rides real time  Sadly for us we figured this out when we were in the middle of our visit so all schedules were filled,1
490,490,4.0,This amusement is vertically huge ranges from b3 to 4th floor It can be very confusing when you first reach there Be sure to get a copy of the map at the info counter after you enter located at 1st floor  I entered by the south gate and arrived at the 1st floor playground for young children They cater rides to kids below the height of 100cm and there were variety  If you walk further towards the centre of the theme park on 1st floor you reached the place where the carousel and viking is There are other rides on 1st floor for older kids and adults Most rides height requirement is about 110cm The more thrilling ones probably above 130cm  2nd floor leads to the outdoor theme park where most of the thrill rides are There are also lots of cafes and restaurants on the 2nd floor indoors as well as 2 other adventure rides  3rd floor houses another 3 more adventure rides and 4th floor is where the hot air ballon ride is  Well its really crazily big and we didnt have the time to complete all the rides as we were rushing off to the aquarium Spent a total of 6 hrs there Study the map plan your time wisely and you will be able to get on most rides Magic pass that helps skip queues save time But sometimes the queue for magic pass can also be quite long for popular rides  Comparatively I prefer everland as it is an outdoor theme park and there is a zoo within the park itself Also it is easier to locate the rides in everland,1
245,245,4.0,Came on a week day but there were loads of people glad we took the tickets with the magic pass and saved a lot of time from queueing overall had a great time,1
248,248,4.0,My 2 teens asked to visit an amusement park Wanted to visit Everland but was quite a distance Decided to visit some place nearer to our hotel Took a cab there and thought that the driver had sent us to the wrong place as we are not aware that the entrance is at the basement Unlike Disneyland Went in and there was a long queue to purchase the tickets There were many students Luckily the queue proceeded smoothly and fast Bought the tickets to the park and folk museum Did not go to the museum so we wasted on that Spent about 3 hours as there werent many rides that appealed to my teens We bought the so called fastpass in the park so my teens need not queue up The place was alright but not as good as Disneyland Need a bit of refurbishment though,1
254,254,4.0,The park is divided into outdoor and indoor Outdoor features some of the most thrilling rides and coupled with a few kiddy rides The castle is one of the prominent display outdoor that you will take picture with Recommended to buy fast passes as most rides have very long waiting time There are also plenty of Restaurants inside the park For very young toddlers they do have a designated indoor areas for them too,1
280,280,4.0,We got our tickets online with a magic pass 5 options Basically you can choose 5 rides and cut the queues without having to book the timing like the magic pass on the main website The entrance tickets are also discounted on the third party website Apparently it is a promotion only for foreigners So you have to bring your passport  The park itself was great fun There were lots of rides for all thrill levels both indoors and outdoors Atlantis Gyro Drop and French Revolution were some of the more thrilling rides I remember riding Definitely worth using the pass for If you visiting with young kids I did see there were some rides that were only for young kids The park really caters to all ages  For the Instagram mets there was also an area inside near the VR attractions for taking selfies The selfie studio is set up with sets and props as well as tripods for rent We loved taking pictures with the various backdrops  We happened to be there for Halloween so there was also costume rentals and face painting extra costs near the entrance There was even a haunted house set up Not to forget the Halloween parade We saw that they even has some of the park guests who were dressed as princesses participate  Lots of food affordable food available as well Food stalls as well as set restaurants and food courts were available all over the park There seems to have been no issues about bringing your own too We brought in our own water  When it was time to go we exited into the Mall and we glad to find that there was a Lotte Mart around the corner of the exit So manage to squeeze in a little grocery shopping before having to head back  Overall I felt it was a fun place to visit for the whole family,1
479,479,4.0,We went on a Monday and arrived slightly before 10am Stayed right through to 5pm Tips  entrance tickets  for foreign visitors i think its better to purchase the entrance tickets onlinebefore hand  we got our tickets at SGD36 per person adult or child alike redemption is at the south gate  look for the counter that says overseas admission it is not the ticket counter that is outside it is located after the main doors  Magic pass i contemplated purchasing the tickets that comes with magic pass but decided not too and didnt regret my choice  as we arrived fairly early on a monday morning  crowds were thin  didnt have to wait more than 15 mins in the morning  we downloaded the Lotte World App  the app gives u 3 free magic passes per ticketholder  we managed to redeem 2 of the 3 magic passes  Crowd  after 2pm  the crowds started to stream in  and thats when the queue starts to form especially for popular rides like the FLUME ride  so for the popular rides u may wish to redeem your magic pass early we didnt know that and when we tried to redeem our 3rd magic pass in the afternoon for the popular ride  the reservation has closed so please note  overall  my child enjoyed the rides  especially the VR rides and had a fun time  for the price we paid  i thought it was worth it,1
472,472,4.0,There are the indoor and outdoor park I suggest you buy the ticket online eg Klook before your visit as you can get cheaper price and some package promo theme park  aquarium  magic pass etc  Magic passes are very useful to avoid long queue at famous attractions Grab a map from the information counter to make the most out of your visit This place took a long time to explore especially if you plan out on trying out rides  Visited here to try the most adrenaline pumping rides INDOOR The Conquistador French Revolution  with VR option OUTDOOR Gyro Spin Gyro Swing Gyro Drop the Atlantis If you have little kids they will also enjoy merry go round shows and parades and other kidsfriendly attractions The 4D Wild Series indoor is also very fun and can be enjoyed by all  For cultural buff they also have the Folk Museum that is not crowded at all as people prefer the rides where you can see miniatures and artefacts from the many eras of the Korean peninsula  Places to eat are mostly restaurants and some snack stalls  Aquarium is located on separate building,1
470,470,4.0,I dont know why people say the queues are so bad they could hardly ride  We went early in the morning and went on the French Revolution twice without queuing for more than 5 mins bad idea cos one can get really dizzy on that ride  I recommend going for Atlantis for your first ride as that ride is by far the most popular Queue was 40 min or so but if you buy the magic pass from klook you can breeze straight to the front and beat the queue If you wish you can use all your magic passes here prob the best cos the other queues are not as long as this  We bought 5 magic passes We went on every single ride French Revolution 3x Atlantis 3 or 4x gyro spin swing drop a couple of times Conquistador 4x  If you download the app you can get some free magic passes these are timed and released every hour and you could use these for the less popular rides We never managed to use the free app magic passes for the popular ones cos they were always sold out so we gave up  Enjoy yourselves The queues are not that bad But please go early,1
573,573,4.0,Very nice place to be with children However the queue is very long for the popular rides and I think will be more worth if purchase the magicpass,1
286,286,4.0,We decided to go to this park on a whim Lotte world is the biggest indoor theme park in the world It is at the edge of the lotte department store at Jamsil station If you buy an online ticket you need to walk all the way around the park to the southern gate and then enter that side It doesnt matter where you leave your bags as the lockers are accessible from several exits of the park  The park extends outdoors and there are some events centred around halloween Specifically the indoor haunted house is not very scary but the outdoor house with entry fee of 5000 won is very scary 55 spooks Rules involved Dont let go of the rope no running dont blind the actors The wait times in the park are so mixed and with a ticket you only get to reserve 3 rides I didnt really like this system as some rides are reservation only and can run out very fast I recommend you book asap for a ride that looks interesting as we missed out on both of the massive indoor roller coasters operating that day Furthermore the outdoor 3 biggest coasters were all closed for maintenance A wait time under 30 minutes is tolerable and not worth wasting a magic pass on The staff were also mind enough to let my friend and I into the same ride even though she was in the reserved session after mine  My other big complaint is that staff are very unprofessional and let their friends into rides ahead of the queue There was a halloween show that started 6pm and two friends went in to chat with their mate despite the sign saying it is dangerous for individuals It also seems impossible to access the ice skating rink without leaving the park Some staff tell you to leave if youre a foreigner to use the outside escalstor and you wont be let back into the park,1
152,152,4.0, Lotte World is so much fun There are a variety of rides and there are 3 magic passes per person so it was nice to be able to ride right away if you succeed every 30 minutes The parade was fun and its a pity I ,1
586,586,4.0,Its one of the most interesting amusement parks of S Korea and conveniently accessible as far as its located inside the city However it is really overcrowded In order to enjoy your time there and to avoid wasting the most of your time waiting on long ques try to avoid if possible weekends and holidays On the other hand using the fastpass can save some waiting time but its availability is very restricted,1
356,356,4.0,If one read most if not all of the reviews you will find a few common themes crowded long queue long waiting hours we experienced more or less the same Looking at it at another perspective I find this location a very popular spot for locals especially students and kindergartens No doubt the basic amenities such as toilets are well maintained so they are clean and functional Plenty of food stalls and restaurants spread out so one never runs out of options  There are plenty of articles floating round on the tips so parents do read them otherwise invest in Magic Pass Premium download the Lotte World Adventure Magicpass app to enjoy a few rides with dedicated time slots Of course avoid peak season if you can  Our children 7 and 1 were enjoying themselves nevertheless but the waiting time really did eat up most hours not forgetting time for lunchdinner and breaks The number of ridesattractions are sufficient to keep the kids occupied enough that they can never finish all the rides  The indoor theme park can be like a maze so parents need to read the map carefully while trying to match the ride timing so that one would not miss the parade So its not just an adventure for the kidsteens but also quite another one for the parents,1
731,731,4.0,If you have been to Disneyland and are expecting something similar then you will be disappointed However if you want to spend a day hanging out with your little ones especially if the weather is bad then Lotte World has plenty to offer you  If you do decide to go then make sure you get a discount voucher available from most hotel lobbiesconcierge  you will find that a 20 percent discount will be offered  Getting to Lotte World is easy on the MRT Take the green line and get off at Jamsil station The MRT signs point you towards Exit 3 if you go out this way the head towards Charlotte Theatre and you will see one of the entrancesticket office Another option will be to head towards Exit 4 but you dont have to leave the underground pedestrian footpath to get to the entranceticket office  Its not obvious as it doesnt stipulate in English but a Day Pass ticket entitles you to 3 Fast Passes for rides although Im not sure if this applies for Half Day Passes There are a few kiosks scattered inside that allows you to chose which rides Fast Passes are available on normally within 45 minutes and not beyond Alternatively download the Lotte World app and register your entrance ticket details to access Fast Passes via your phone I believe that if you can buy Fast Passes if you go beyond the complimentary 3 that come with your day pass ticket  Once inside it the multilevel and indoor and outside areas require a certain amount of orienteering Rule of thumb is that the outside area has the majority of the fastbig rides whilst the inside has about 3 big rides but mainly caters to the young audience We went as a family of 4 two little ones under 7 yrs old went on most of the rides that the children could ride on they are quite strict on height arrived at 1130am and left at 830pm Exhausted  Lotte World tries hard to imitate Disneyland There are parade shows and a fairytale castle but ultimately the lack of recognisable characters no Mickey and Minnie et al make them unmemorable So forget the unmemorable merchandising and just go for the rides  Lotte World does not check your backpackhandbags so you are free to bring outside food and drink with you  PS The cherry blossom has just come into season and there are a number of trees surrounding the outside area that make it more memorable than it would be otherwise,1
725,725,4.0,We spotted this while roaming around the Lotte shopping area Though it was 4pm but we decided to go in and explore this indoor and outdoor adventure park We even got a discount as they offer discounts after 4pm on the day Pass There was a waiting of almost 3045 mins on all the popular rides but it was worth waiting in the queue We loved the V R roller coaster and air balloon ride If you have the patience of waiting for 45 mins per ride then its definitely worth buying a day pass to spend a few hours in th evening Outdoor theme park is also beautiful with lots of rides and amazing view of cherry blossom in the spring season,1
714,714,4.0,Lotte World is a park that is different than any other youve been to before Most of the park is located in a huge mall with rides stuck in the walls of several different floors There is also a small outdoor section that maximizes its space by going underground Lotte World is not short on attractions but there is no single wow attraction there  a lot of good ones but no marquee Thats the one complaint I have about the park Many of the rides are out of the box purchases from ride manufacturers The rides are in no way modified and just plopped down here or there With all of the rides though how do you make it through everything in a day Use the Lotte World app to book Fastpass times throughout the day You get 3 free ones a day Depending on what you like you should make your choices some combination of Atlantis French Revolution Comet Express Flume and Pharaohs Fury These rides get the longest queues Furthermore youll likely have to cut some rides out because of the volume of stuff there is to do To me the must do attractions are Atlantis Comet Express Pharaohs Fury Adventures of Sinbad and Aeronauts Balloon Ride The rides that get a lot of attention but you can skip are French Revolution Flume and the Conquistador The rides that dont get a lot of attention but you shouldnt miss are Castle Magic Show Fantasy Dream Jungle Adventure and Fly Venture,1
380,380,4.0,Avoid at Christmastime Great place to visit but queuing for 2 hours for most rides took the shine off I dont know how much a magic pass is but I think it would be worth investigating to go to the front of every line,1
712,712,4.0,Never pay full price for entry tickets if youre a foreigner There are a number of ways to get cheaper entrance tickets and we used Funtastic Korea voucher received 45 discount Despite it saying need 12 days before getting a confirmation email I received this within 10 minutes just ensure bookings are open on the day you want to visit Follow the entry instructions and make sure you take the passport in which the voucher was registered  Lotte World itself is crazy busy at any time Suggest you get there as early as you can Queues can be lengthy Download the Lotte World app to receive three magic passes for quicker entry to your selected rides though wait times can still be more than two hours  The five year old loved his age appropriate rides Yes there is a height restriction and as long as above 110cm then they are allowed on most of the kiddy rides They measure you pretty much at each ride there are a few allowing 90cm,1
26,26,4.0,The place is enjoyable but I recommend migic pass if you are visiting on weekend or holidays Each ride has a wait time for more then an hr or 2 so it was a bit disappointing for the wait,1
1601,1601,4.0,Overall A nice experience within a stones throw of the hotel in downtown Seoul  Liked Best Lots of rides for young children Lines moved fasterwere shorter than Everland which was a surprise on the day we went since the park is literally in the city Park layout had the bigger rides for older kids in the adjoining Adventure Magic Island so there is less walking from ride to ride  Liked Least 1 Cost inside is high for what is available 2 Some attractions inside are still extra cost even with the all inclusive ticket  Tips 1 There are fast passess to use for the popular rides 2 Food is expensive and limited in scope inside  there is a food court just outside Lotte World in the connected mall ie hamburgers tacos if you need a lower price optionbut need to ask for reentry,1
381,381,4.0,Lotte World is a large indoor theme park covering multi stories and including an outdoor area The rides range from kiddie rides through to relatively large roller coasters that older kids will love If youre coming in winter be prepared to layer on and off if youre going to be in or outside  Best to arrive first thing when the crowds are small and queues are short  go to the most popular rides first  Atlantis French Revolution Pharaohs Rage etc otherwise be prepared to queue for up to 2 hours when the crowd builds up especially in the holiday season  The park is clean and well presented and offers a Disneyeque feel complete with their own Snow White Castle  The entry ticket we got 20 off using MasterCard is generally all inclusive a small handful of rides require extra payment There is a range of food from local to western Prices are generally higher than outside  There is a Lotte World app that can book Magic Passes like Disney fast passes but we couldnt get them to work perhaps they need to be booked first thing So suggest some preplanning is essential to get the best out of the park,1
392,392,4.0,Went on a Wednesday morning but it was so packed with Korean teenagers many in school uniform It makes me wonder if that was a school excursion or it is a trend to visit theme Parks in school uniforms  We reached there exactly at 930am and when the doors were opened teenagers starting sprinting towards the rides and queues began to form  Not intending to wait too Long for rides we each paid 40000 won for the 5 rides express pass The counter for express pass is located behind the famous Carousel ride A paper band will be tied around your wrist Just show the band to the personnel at the express ride queue and they will mark on the wrist band Choose to use the wrist band wisely Some rides have queues that move quite fast Eg the pirate ship ride which allows 60 riders or more per rid so one should not use the wrist band here The express pass is really useful for rides that have queues up to 1h Long Atlantis and French Revolution have Super Long queues and these are reall high intensity fun rides Use your express pass here Gyro Swing is another ride which has ridiculously Long queue  Dont forget to go to level 23 where there is a photography area with many feature walls to take nice instragammable photos,1
395,395,4.0,The theme park is not big but it has all the rides and facilities Most rides are for older child with height more than 110cm We spent some time studying the floor maps because the signage was not very clear It was long queue during winter We tried to use the magic pass but some rides did not accept the pass Anyway all of us were having great fun there The parade was not very interesting We were confused about the direction to get there initially because the area was a combination of mall hotel and park No signage to show us how to go to theme park from sunway The exit of the subway is 1 or 2 And the park was located near the food departmental store,1
666,666,4.0,We visited with children that are 12 10 and 8 years old There are some fun roller coasters for them all We were there from about 1030 until 10pm and were able to ride almost everything and rode our favorite rides twice We chose this park over Everland because it is so convenient to Seoul We bought out tickets through Funtastic Korea and got a great discount Make sure you buy the 1day pass if you want to ride the rides because the General Admission tickets just get you in the park Dont lose you tickets either because you have to show them as you enter each ride,1
400,400,4.0,What a fun day at Lotte World So many rides and lots to see It is difficult to navigate around There is so much packed in that you dont see all the rides unless you go down every street and every corner It is really tough to find the stairs or escalators as well Lines arent long but the wait to get on a ride takes forever They could introduce more efficientcy by counting passengers while the ride runs and limiting the number of Magic Passes allowed on a ride We went on a Monday and not a super busy day but wait times were 4560 for the more popular rides,1
127,127,4.0,Prepurchased tickets for foreigners that included 5 magicpasses Took about 10 minutes to get in at opening ,1
414,414,4.0,Its a fantastic place if youre travelling with older kids Theres a whole floor for younger kids which we only found later in the afternoon Queues were crazy on the Friday we visited due to schoolgoing kids of all ages So if youre really keen on getting on the rides on a Friday or weekend do check it they sell fast passes But definitely do avoid Fridays and weekends if you can We went back to Lotte World for Pororo Park on Thursday and it was really rather quiet so do consider going on a weekday,1
594,594,4.0,I went during the summer when school was off so there was quite a lot of people But the best thing was the magic passes Even though some of the lines were long by planning ahead I was able to rid on quite a number of attractions before the end of the day One downside was the hot weather So be careful if you go during the summer,1
574,574,4.0,Visited with family with 2 children during very cold winter of Seoul Its very good as there are indoor and outdoor theme park Indoor theme park is perfectly well during the winter time especially when the temperature outside is minus degrees The theme park is not very big actually but its good enough for you to spend whole day there Its easily accessible via Jamsil Subway and linked directly with the subway station Plenty of shops and restaurants located at the same places If youre not a locals you could get good discount by buying the ticket from 3rd party website which enable you to enjoy discount of more than 40 for the admission fee We paid only USD30 pax for the ticket while buying on site the ticket price for adult is KRW55000adult and KRW45000child for a day pass Worth the visit if you visit Seoul with family  children,1
755,755,4.0,This is my second visit and we really enjoy the outdoor game  The place is huge and manage your time efficiently   You can reserve and have the magic pass online or you must q at island magic find the red box at center to reserve therefore u dont have to wait for a game The next reservation is every 2 hour  U can also purchase 5 time magic pass cost you 35000 won or all day magic pass 110000 won  For muslim they have halal kebab rest nearby bumper car and nice muslim prayer at resting area 3rd floor,1
1336,1336,5.0,That was a very wet tripnonstop rain during that few days trip Luckily we booked the Character twin room The room was not just only very colorful kidsfriendly clean and tidy even the character soft toys were so clean that my girl has no hesitation to hug them once she entered the room but also the whole corridor of that floor was well decorated It was very attractive once the lift door was opened  Best of all the staffs of Lotte World Hotel were so friendly and helpful especially the staff of concierge Not just giving us very warm greeting whenever we passed by while we were staying for the whole day in the hotel due to the heavy rain but also giving us excellent advise and brilliant idea of visiting the local Korea culture that we could not even found that from any travel guide book  My little girl just feel like home when she was staying in Lotte World Hotel and that would be my first choice of staying hotel in Seoul,1
172,172,5.0,Went there with my wife and boy we had so much fun I highly recommend going in early and have some magic passes ready you definitely would need them,1
1479,1479,5.0,I only heard about Lotte World from some Youtube videos I was so pleasantly surprised that it took less than one hour from Insadong using the metro railsubway system You can buy a day pass but we got there after 400 pm so the admission fee was US 17 per person to ride all the rides and the lines were short Lotte World has an outdoor part which is sort of like a much smaller version of Disneyland in California and two indoor parts which has rides for younger kids There is even a skating rink on the bottom floor I rode the big kids rides in the outdoor part which has a castle modeled on the Sleeping Beauty Castle in Disneyland If you have had enough of palace tours and want to eat cotton candy while looking for some fun this is the place for some roller coaster type rides This place is not as big as Disneyland in California or even Six Flags Magic Mountain or any of the serious scary rides in the USA It reminds me of Ocean Park in Hong Kong,1
1315,1315,5.0,purchased one day pass we downloaded the magic pass which we can avoid the long queue well we did not stay long we already tired after few games we were a middle age couple who trying to have some fun apparently we had fun but for sure we will not come back for second time,1
1490,1490,5.0,Took my 4 year old boy to the park  we beat the queue at the entrance by getting a pass from the Lotte World Hotel and discounted too We went after 4 and some junior rides were quick to get on There were lots of rides suitable for under 7 and the little guy had a great time We went once before in summer and this time in winterspring when its subzero outside The indoor park caters well for both weather Staff are quite good with English too,1
1521,1521,5.0,We went in a group of 22 year old boys and even so we enjoyed ourselves greatly The outside section accommodates much more for older people with some rides only for adults The outside section is well set out with most rides a short wait 46 AUD for a days pass the park offers an enjoyable day out for all ages Highly recommended if wanting to find something to do whilst in Korea We went in the early afternoon around 12pm To save waittimes,1
126,126,5.0,Lots of fun for the whole family It has a lot of indoor attractions so even if its raining you can still go here If you dont like waiting in lines consider purchasing the magic pass which allows you to bypass the lines,1
94,94,5.0, It is good because there are many 3D and 4D rides that even those who cannot ride scary rides can ride If you do not want to stand in line we recommend purchasing a pass It is nice to be able to ride without ,1
93,93,5.0, Lotte World is absolutely awesome There are magic passes lots of snacks and the rides are safe and fun The parade is super fun ,1
58,58,5.0, it was fun I use the free pass 10 times I only picked the fun stuff ,1
22,22,5.0, I went with my friends but I have to buy a ticket to get into the neighborhood and it would be better if I had a magic pass ready Waiting time is crazy ,1
1591,1591,5.0,Im from Florida so its important to note that this does not compare to Florida amusement parks but I still think that this was a great experience It had never been on an inside ride before so that was a novelty The inside water ride wasnt actually that bad but you will get wet Outside is the place to be for the roller coasters The Gyro Swing was great but if you have motion sickness its not for you The bumper cars are awesomeThe Atlantic Adventure is a proper coaster but be prepared for a really long line If you can definitely go on a week day I had a really unique and fun experience Make sure to look online for discounts for foreigners couples or for a night pass,1
282,282,5.0,We took friends here who are visiting Korea for the first time It was also our first time We missed getting the magic passes that come with your regular park admission so will remember that for next time We were also here for the big halloween party so crowds got heavier than I anticipated in the afternoon but we had a really nice time My friend had trouble using her card won is easiest Lots of options for food and reasonable lines,1
300,300,5.0,Lotte World is an indooroutdoor amusement park in Seoul which is easily accessible by public transportation There are attractions for everyone in the family from the fun to the thrilling and you can easily spend much time here Take advantage of the fast pass feature for the attractions that are popular and make the most of your visit,1
1127,1127,5.0,We just came to window shop and my wife checked all the designers store All the beauty products under the sun is here plus more Duty free shopping is also available here very convenient for foreigners to shop The food section is unbelievable anything you want is available both local and imported items The quality and availability of food items in this market surpassed the US supermarkets,1

744,744,5.0,There were too many rides and attractions but for the best ones lines were too long Unless you buy an M pass to bypass those in line which is a tad too expensive for me Regardless there are still a lot you can ride or experience,1

816,816,5.0,This was an awesome experience and Im so glad I went It definitely feels like Disneylands younger sister who is much smaller but still tries to emulate her older sibling It was fun to go on the different rides and be likeOH this is like Pirates of the Caribbeanor OH this is definitely their version of space mountain They even have their version of Mickey and Minnie The Foxs Lotty and Lorry It was awesome  Solo traveler Im 28 years old I went by myself and I had a blast Definitely something easy and entertaining to do if youre traveling solo as long as you dont mind being surrounded by teenagers  Food I had a smoothie a Popsicle and some fried won tons I thought everything was pretty delicious  Price It was like 40 for an all day pass which means you get to ride the rides I thought that was well worth it I only spent about 5 hours there but I felt like I got my moneys worth,1
681,681,5.0,What makes Lotte world different from many other theme parks is that it has quite a huge airconditioned what a great plus for summer season indoor theme park section There are many levels of different rides and simply exploring the place makes an interesting experience  I like that rides are of varying thrill levels making it suitable for kids as well as thrillseekers I would definitely recommend it for families even with young children as they have a huge kiddy play section  I went on a weekday and hardly queued for more than 10 min per ride and I took about 14 rides in total Only had to queue 30 min for 1 or 2 rides I was also lucky to find discounted tickets online for foreigners and ended up paying 29000 instead of 52000 won You can google it and purchase them in advance but remember to bring your passport there,1
840,840,5.0,Whatever the weather is cold or hot outside you can have a great time in the indoor part The food provided inside is good with reasonable price The attractions are great but some may need to queue up for a long time especially those thrill ride in indoor or outdoor The magic pass is good but you need to arrive early to get those it from the hot attractions ie the thrill roller coaster indoor and outdoor Highly recommended for family,1
856,856,5.0,I went here when it was like 2012 then the day after all the Kpop idols had some Pepero thing there T T It was a really nice experience but you have to be really patient with the queues though But I managed to sit through all of themAnd Im the most impatient person you can find But its worth it I recommend getting all the fast passes or something I forgot what its called so meanwhile you can go play other things that doesnt have long queues after you get the pass D y,1
647,647,5.0,We just came to window shop and my wife checked all the designers store All the beauty products under the sun is here plus more Duty free shopping is also available here very convenient for foreigners to shop The food section is unbelievable anything you want is available both local and imported items The quality and availability of food items in this market surpassed the US supermarkets,1
635,635,5.0,During our three day stay in Seoul we made one full day visit to Lotte World It is total fun park with many attractions 3D movie theaters and different choices to eat It is a busy place so I recommended coming early or buy the magic pass It is normal to wait for more than 15 minutes ,1
597,597,5.0,We brought 2 kids age 4 and 6 to Lotte World theme park and they had whale of a time Although my younger girl cant take most rides shorter than 110cm she thoroughly enjoy the 230pm and 830pm parade and the magic show at Fairy Theatre  We were there 1130am  9pm and honestly only manage to cover the whole indoor adventure park but for outdoor barely cover 20 Will highly recommend families to stay whole day If you wish to visit the Lotte Aquarium or Pororo Park please arrange separately as the 1 Day pass for your to enter Lotte World theme park when you exit cannot reenter  I had gone to Pororo Park on 2 other days 2 hours this is the limit for the ticket entry price on each day The small playground with slide rooms with Lego blocks and building blocks Pororo  Friends performance the big bouncing castle carousel only open for small intervals on weekday ferries Wheel and bumper car are all really fun for both my kids Although it is more crowded on weekend the rides are all more frequent hence dont really need to queue much Personally think my kids had more fun on weekend as they manage to catch more rides during the 2 hours compared to a weekday And parents with preschoolers trust me although it is only 2 hours it is enough to exhaust them that the kids will sleep early that day,1

301,301,5.0,There are 2 different kinds of magic passes One is 5 rides and the other is day pass What I learned today was that magic day pass is unlimited and no need to book You just show up and enjoy a ride Important point is that this day pass is only available for the first 100 customers who come to the magic pass stand inside of the lotte world So once you get in with your general access card go to the magic pass stand right away to get yours  We were there until 6pm with plenty of resting and eating But did at least 13 rides Highly recommended Good luck and hope you enjoy your visit,1

508,508,5.0,Tips Book in advanced Get a Magic Pass to skip the long queue you still need to fall in line though but magic pass holders are kind of priority Be there early Some of the rides close early the Magic pass lane Download their app so you can plan what time and which ride you want to do first  Wear your most comfortable shoes  The best rides for me though French Revolution Atlantis Pharoahs fury Gyro drop  Bungee drop  If we have more time and magic pass Id still want to try sinbad log fume carousel etc as they have good reviews But we only have 5 pass and were too tired lol,1

1041,1041,5.0,Hotel Lotte was a bit old but very well maintained The character room gave good excitement to my sons 6  8 especially due to its Wii Service is also excellent I emailed them in advance to enquire about the beds since I only managed to book nonsuite character room with 2 twin beds but they helped me to get a room with a queen bed and a single bed with trundle which is exactly what I need  The location is indeed convenient from the Lotte theme park which is in the mall next door with a connecting passage  Price is on the high side but with all benefits above its quite worth it Will come back again,1

342,342,5.0,grabbed margaritas from Vatos urban tacos mallside bar in the underground Lotte world Shopping malls We were margaritad quickly and firmly Regardless we managed to buy the tickets online at the gate a huge saving Sidestep to the one hour of ice skating where my friend ice skated well his first time  I was speed skating in rental skates OMG so much margarita courage hahaha having an amazing time Actually we lost any idea of time but it was running out Made our way to the foreign guest entrance for Lotte world which was challenging yet we made it in We lost things along the way some shopping a power bankhahaha when we finally found the indoor French revolution rollercoaster there was a 70min estimated wait  then an angle appeared out of nowhere and vipd us to the front of a queue with a magic pass It was actual magic Thank goodness  Then an awesome 4D movie adventure Flyventure excellent We did see a lights parade  indoor fireworks during our chaotic cascade through this indoor entertainment shrine All in all we missjudge available time  missed alot but still have and amazing fun tale to tell Really it was very cool very wow  Arriving as late as we did the full price would not have been great value So if your short on time or late or experiencing high times this deal makes it really worthwhile,1
533,533,5.0,Visited Lotte world with my 11 year old pre teen Booked tickets on KLOOK  got the one with 5 premium magic passes each Did not regret it one bit These magic passes are used like the Disneyland fast passes simply present the passes indicated on the ticket and struck off once used for a ride  enter a separate queue for magic pass and board the ride It was challenging trying to obtain magic passes using the app  the entrance ticket itself includes 3 magic passes  but these are subject to availability We did not bother obtaining any after failing in the first hour  To avoid the crowd we purposely visited on a Monday Got in at 930 once the park opened Finished the thrill rides by 1130 with merely 510 min queues each By noon the lines were snaking around But it didnt look too bad  wait time was 1530 min max We opted to use our premium magic passes for repeat rides which my daughter really enjoyed The park was most crowded from mid afternoon onwards Our favorites were the Atlantis and gyro swing We are adrenaline junkies Unfortunately the gyro drop and French Revolution were closed for maintenance  For the price paid it was a fun day out Very value for money Do not forget to explore the underland  these were the bulk of the VR rides so avoid if prone to get motion sickness or giddy  Food was decently priced not exorbitant for a theme park A large drink and popcorn chicken went for 6000won Please do yourself a favor and rent a locker  1000won only  per use  cant open repeatedly,1
697,697,5.0,This place  mall  attraction whatever you want to call it is very much with everything that you need to entertain your children below 10yo you can do it here  They have an indoor and an outdoor theme park Get here earlier because the entrance is a bit much if you come in the afternoon They do offer a pass where you can jsmust take alook around Its giod for you just to take pictures  Its connected to the subway so you can visit at anytime summer winter even in rainy days  still comfortable Enjoy your time here,1
