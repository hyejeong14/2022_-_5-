595,595,1.0,I understand there are queues on theme parks but I have never seen anything like these 2 hour queues Managed to get to 3 rides but none are the popular ones mainly outdoor where is was sun baking us it was extremely crowded when we went and staff were not helpful trying to manage the population,0
308,308,1.0,We got a baby and we have asked if we could take the ride before queueing up and Hans the facilitator said yes After queueing up for 15hr he refused us to take the ride and said we had to get him a baby ticket instead It was absolutely unfair as I have double checked with him before queueing up he should have let us know right from the beginning before letting us to queue up for so long so that we would get a baby ticket first We were treated unfairly as no facilitator or sign has told us to get a baby ticket at the entrance nor at the ride We actually have bought three adults tickets which costed more for 2 adults and a baby instead we have shown the tickets to him but still he insisted that we have to get a baby ticket instead The facilitators there did not check any other tickets but us  We felt like we were treated differently just because we were not Korean We were absolutely disappointed Please dont go there if you cant speak Korean as non of them understand English properly,0
323,323,1.0,We went on a Friday after Memorial day holiday in Seoul May have been the most stupid time to go other than memorial day itself  I paid for 3 tickets on Kloop ticket collection was far away from the main entrance A good 1015min walk after asking 3 different people and added 5 magic passes to two of those tickets for an extra S100 What a waste of money The magic pass system is terrible Every 15 minutes the system opens to allow time slots to be booked to reserve the ride and skip the queue It has very limited number of time slots each hour and try as we might for 2 hours we could not reserve anything Each time the reservation started It showed all slots filledclosed about 10 seconds after it opened Eventually all time slots had been reserved and we had to queue with everyone else So that was 100 down the drain We didnt ride any of the popular rides because the queues were 90 to 110mins per ride We were there for 10 hours until closing time and rode 5 rides all day We thought Screw it lets pay extra to play the VR games But no Theres a height restriction and my girl was 5cm below it  Also the stupid parade that they run through the main indoor Adventure land around 2pm will section off large areas which cannot be crossed easily or at all during some parts of the parade So dont get separated or you wont be able to return until after the parade ends And all this online advice about going for the popular rides during the parade I found to be bull crap The queues were long and getting longer still  While my 10yr old enjoyed it as an adult  I wouldnt wish the experience on my worst enemy Only a parents love for his kids got me through this day  Just be prepared to queue Bring your tunes and your headphones battery pack for your phones a portable fan sweaty queues whether indoor or out snacks drinks and pack light There are plenty of lockers but they are single use so if you do use them then make sure you keep the important stuff with you One thing I wish I had was a collapsible stool You will stand for a long long time at Lotte World in queue after queue I saw some parent bring a picnic mat for the kids to sit and lie on She was a local with local knowledge  Food and beverage prices are not super expensive but nor are they cheap Expect to pay amusement park prices  I wish I could say something nice about Lotte World but I cant I just taste bitterness,0
706,706,1.0,I happened to wind up going there on a day when all the schools decided to have their outing on the same day I ended up asking for a refund after about 45 minutes I was told the queue for the roller Coaster outside was 3 hours long Everything else inside looked really long too  The inside section of the park needs some serious updating Didnt go to Everland the week I went as a result of finding out how bogged down with people this place gets  As I left in the late afternoon the queue was much worse There really should be a cap to the number of people they let come into this place  And whatever yo do absolutely avoid any holidays Especially the first week in May,0
1081,1081,1.0,Too Long queueing  not worthy for couple One day pass not worth it During winters out door park are closed,0
279,279,1.0,What a disappointment this place was  We arrived at around 6pm for some evening fun paying around 30pp to get in There was no indication at the ticket desk that most of the major rides were either closed or reservation only  whatever that means  So upon entering the park we try to get on some of the big rides  French Revolution Closed for Inspections  Drop tower Closed for Inspections  Gyro drop Just closed  Comet coaster Reservations only and rude staff  Atlantis coaster Huge queue but at the back of it Closed and rude staff  Some of the other smaller rides inside were pleasant enough and the park is themed beautifully just a shame that they decided to charge full price when all their major rides were innaccessible  Also anytime we tried to spend money including buying the tickets with our GBP credit cards in the park we were forced to use their scammy currency conversion and end up paying a huge fee All the staff said paying in KRW doesnt work  what a load of rubbish  In short avoid this place at all costs and enjoy somewhere else in Seoul for the day or evening,0
338,338,1.0,Im writing this while still in the queue for our second ride We have been here for 4 and a half hours now I was afraid it could be crowded so we went on a Monday and I bought a 5x Magicpass which i could not use a single time because all seats have been booked out almost immediately for all attractions which are popular I think its only worth a visit if you are totally into waiting or if you come with children because the attractions for small children seem to have less waiting times,0
340,340,1.0,Here is our experience 3 adults and 2 kids We were picked up at 830 from the hotel and taken to Lotte World The trip took some 60 min and after getting organized with tickets etc it was already 10 We were told to return to the meeting point at 1120 We all got full day tickets including any rides After getting familiarized we realized that there were so all Magic tour tickets available allowing to skip the line Further more also attendants tickets for adults just following the kids around and not doing rides Cheaper of course Our 4 year old managed 3 rides and our 12 year old managed only 1 and had to give up the 2nd ride due to too long queue  At 1123 we were noticed that time was up and time to return either direct to hotel or to a shopping center We opted for the shopping center which turned out to be a small souvenir shop Later on I reviewed what we had booked and paid for USD 294  It was a whole day Lotte World Package Deal If by any chance Viator or the tour operator read this our Booking reference was BR697267984 We were clearly cheated We had enough other things to do in Seoul so did not do anything about this then But now thinking back I like to warn others for this   ,0
507,507,1.0,We reached there at around 2pm and wanted to stay till the night as the park opens late for that day The day has been gloomy thus we have already expected all outdoor attractions to be closed Upon reaching we saw that most attractions had queues of 80min and up We proceeded to utilize the magic pass mobile app in hopes to snag a magic pass however the app was loading the whole time and could not even get us to the landing page  We went on to walk around the premises to see if there were attractions with shorter queue As we walked on the app finally loaded and we checked on waiting time to see a few attractions 015min wait Upon rushing it were we told that the ride was under maintenance which was why the app reflected such a short waiting time  The park had similar naming rides that we rushed in order to make it in time for the magic pass only to know that we were at the wrong location After an hour or so we so frustrated by whats happening that we went to the customer service counter to see what else Lotte World could offer We were shocked to know that at the point of our query only a total of 8 rides and they were all kiddie attractions or lesser were available as all the others were under maintenance  I cant imagine heading into a theme park and wanting out so badly due to what is happening We were there for 3hours 1 hour was spent on lunch and the remaining 2 was spent finding and getting rejected from rides The good thing out of the whole situation we managed to get on 1 ride which we thought were for adults but nope it wasnt,0
292,292,1.0,Too many people Each ride need to queue up for at least 2 hours Never go again The theme park is very old,0
358,358,1.0,Came here with my sister on a Wednesday and it was packed with students No personal space during the line up will most likely get bumped Waiting time were minimum 2 hours  What foreigners need to know is that they have a lotte world adventure apps where u can reserve 3 rides per person We only knew about it at 11am and most of the rides were fully booked for all the slots Managed to book the pharaoh which was somewhat a fun ride Its called the magic pass reservation Be sure to reserve magic pass for the more trilling rides after getting your tickets We waited for the French Revolution for a whooping 35hours The ride lasted less than a minute and VR was working Not the best experience Never going again You will see the longest queue in your life Went there at 930am left at 8pm Managed to get on 5 rides only Not worth my time and money tbh Shouldve went to Everland People in their 20s should just go to Everland for more thrilling rides This place can be skipped for sure,0
252,252,1.0,Not that wow like I expected Park was not as good as we expected I was excited at first during the entrance but was greeted with disappointment after a while The queues for all rides is too long I waited 120 mins for the hot air balloon which is not that cool after all While queuing you can listen to a speaker kept repeating the same sentence on and on in Korean language which makes us very annoying more like chanting until we found out is actually a greet and bye from the staff when u get down from the rides No merchandise items were sold inside which double the disappointment for me and my sister Those plan to visit Korea this place not an ideal but you can try if u want too Something similar with Genting Highlands,0
303,303,1.0,The park is too busy  it waste of money to go there and pay USD50 for an adult where you are do nothing else waiting in a queue for your kids also you are not allowed to go outside the park and come back using the same ticket  I prefer going to EVERLAND instead,0
576,576,1.0,Small crowded and long queue Expensive and not worth visiting Cheaper  better to visit HK Disneyland,0
572,572,1.0,Went there with my family of 4 and most of the outdoor rides were closed because of winter time and a lot of indoor rides were under inspection hence closed They didnt even tell the patrons when we bought the tickets The rest of the rides were either too kiddy even for my 6 years old or the queue was like 2 hours We ended up spending only 2 hours there and took 1 ride which is the merry goround Totally a bad experience Cannot go during winter time This place is also meant for toddlers Far far from disney standard,0
155,155,1.0, Unfortunately we didnt like our trip to Lotte World Many attractions were not open and the waiting times were excessively long For example we had to queue for 2 hours for an attraction this was not even for a ,0

757,757,2.0,This indoor theme park would probably be really enjoyable for children under 10 and their parents As two adults we found majority of the rides quite tame The rides that looked like they would be more appropriate for us had massive queues of over 2 hours on a weekday and the magic passes had all been used We used the discount coupon from the airport bus ticket but it still was an expensive day due to the limited appropriate rides,0
815,815,2.0,Ok so before you go to Lotte World ask yourself a couple of questions  Do you like lines Do you like noisy eating areas Do you like hidden costs Do you want to feel more like a dollar sign and less like a human  If you answered yes to these then Lotte World is for you  The whole place is terribly busy and designed poorly you feel crampt even not waiting in a line When your waiting in a line prepare for camping a couple of hours with most main rides taking at least 120min wait The rides that didnt are poor or average at best  The eating areas were open right next to rides so prepare for a noisy experience when you want to relax for lunch Like dining in a club  Many attractions inside actually cost money so when you see a big queue and head for the short queue you find it costs 3000  The staff were very rude and not fun They didnt care about their customers and didnt have that fun land happy attitude I would expect from such a place  All in all the place was dull With crampt almost unfinished rendered corridors at parts with dull lighting it almost seemed like each area had its own budget and refused to fund the walkways between  Honestly everything that fails at this place is a win at Everland Some people say they hate the happy music and smiles of Everland but a place like this should be that way and trust me happy cheerful smiles go a long way to make the scene  A final note  Please just accept these things and you will have a good time If you go in expecting a diamond you wont find that just be patient get a snack for the queues and dont limit yourself to a short visit,0
336,336,2.0,Too crowded Had to queue 3 hours for one single outdoor ride Way too many people and it was not enjoyable at all Not recommended Perhaps the indoor rides would take a shorter time but overall not enjoyable at all,0
371,371,2.0,Ok we were here on a Saturday night which is probably not ideal as it is very busy  The rides are mainly for little kids so nothing too exciting for adults We wanted to go on the hot air balloon ride but the queue was 2 hrs We queued for about 12hr for the monorail ride but because its winter half of the ride route was cancelled so it was a very short one  Some nice photo ops outside at the Disney looking castle so make sure you go out of the building  walk around a bit  We were lucky that there was a Christmas parade  this was the highlight of this visit,0
361,361,2.0,Huge crazy place A lot of people huge queue In fact you will not have opportunity visiting more then only few action cause the time in queue takes about 130 hours,0
1476,1476,2.0,Visited here last Thursday evening just before a Korean holiday weekend at 8pm with my girlfriend Thought the chance to walk around for 17000 won would make it worthwhile for my first visit but this is a poor date location Lotte World was mobbed with middleschool students in their school uniforms taking selfie pictures with every attraction in site Lines were long even late in the evening and the indoor section of the park closed down completely from 825910 for a parade which was pretty lame  Lotte World is pretty old and not that large though conveniently located in the middle of Gangnam so considering the value of the land it sits on the park is a reasonable size The few rides we took without the long lines were quite basic shooting some dragons a 3D hauntedhouse movie and a balloon IMAX movie that my girlfriend found entirely disappointing  not the balloon simulation that she was expecting Anything worth riding had a 2030 minute queue and just about every line was closed by around 930pm so you just dont get to try anything with the late admission ticket  For 2 adult visitors Lotte World was very underwhelming Avoid,0
577,577,2.0,Visited on a day that was pouring with rain with the hopes that the worlds apparently largest indoor themepark would have something to offer Even for a Monday the place was packed To make it worse the outdoor attractions shut down in the rain making indoors even more crowded There were threehour queues snaking around the park If youre used to the likes of Universal Studios I would say to give Lotte World a miss if youre only in Seoul for a week,0
351,351,2.0,Costs about 57000W 50 each and that doesnt get you into all the rides The prices drop after 4pm The wee ones about were having a great time I advise you to get there early  The queues are absolutely horrendous upwards of 60 minutes for everything from the monorail to the balloons The Haunted House and Hall of Mirrors are not included and cost extra because theres profit to be had thats why  Its a very strange place that looks like a deranged billionaire took elaborate steps to exactly copy Disney World but had a lawyer tweak it all juust enough to not be sued  Expect Rickey Louse Roland Cluck and their slowwitted accomplice Doofy with his dog Plato to ride on parade singing about how amazing the LOTTE Corporation a division of GloboDynamix Defence Systems is overpriced nibbles permeating the air with 20 calories of sugar per breath lines stretching into the next millennium and people everywhere no space unfilled by person not an iota of room not occupied by human literally 100 of all available capacity used by corpus humanis In other words stuffed to the gunnels with homo sapiens  Kids will like it though ,0
390,390,2.0,Unless youre really desperate to spend money on any average theme park dont go The rides and premises feels old and tattered The crowds are packed and the queues are crazy long 2 hours for a short unexciting roller coaster ride Its also small with limited attractions We were bored stiff despite spending a fortune on the entrance fee,0
1393,1393,2.0,We went during peak season and there was so many people lining up for every single ride There are magic passes for three rides and you can reserve a time for quick access and avoid the queue However we found that most of the rides had their allocation exhausted and we couldnt use the magic passes Wait times were around 40100 minutes for the popular rides We got shortchanged buying the headbands from the stalls and the food is pretty bland and staff not particularly attentive or friendly,0
1424,1424,2.0,Visited Lotte World at the end of a weeklong holiday in Seoul I have to say that while Lotte World is impressive at first sight it ended up being more of a disappointment at the end We went on a random Friday in October thinking that it would not be packed but my husband and I were shocked to see the amount of Korean teenagers there in the middle of the school day The queues for the best rides were HOURS and the Lotte Magic Pass system only worked every 2 hours By noon all of the Magic Pass reservations were closed which was discouraging because if we would have stood in line for the estimated queue times for all the big rides we would have been waiting until midnight We came rather early around 1030 and already it was a mad house I definitely felt like I wasted my last day in Seoul at Lotte World,0
1513,1513,2.0,The place is nice with great rides but only if you are patient enough to wait in the queue for an hour and a half per ride We felt like we are not getting much value for our money since we did not feel like spending the whole day standing in the queue In the evening some of the rides were closed even though the place was supposed to be open till late and for this reason the queues were equally long in the evenings Moreover you cannot leave the place and go shopping or do something else for a while and then go back your one day pass is not valid anymore if you leave the area There was no smoking area in the whole place,0
425,425,2.0,My hubby accompanied my mumin law to the toilet  And my SIL did inform the staff that they went to the toilet prior to queueing When they returned they refused to let my hubby boarded the ride and simply showed us a card that we cant cut queue In the end they only allowed my MIL to go up  Separately we were queueing behind for the second cabin I asked if they allowed my hubby to join us again they refused I told them 45 persons are allowed and we only have 4 persons here And the same reason we are not supposed to cut queue  Nothing fanastic about their rides  bad service  For Singaporean or Malaysian who are visiting Seoul my advise is you can give this amusement park a miss  Personally Prefer disneyland and Universal studio,0
423,423,2.0,We visited the park on a Saturday and it was very crowded and busy  without fast pass we had to queue about an hour for each ride We gave up after two rides  and went shopping at the lotte supermarket instead ,0
640,640,2.0,In hot summer and school holiday period avoid to go to this place where long queues waiting for hours for activities and young kids gathered joyfully within refreshment spots But it is worth to note that Koreans are proud to have their own amusement park like the scale of disneyland ocean park  with good management and profit Also there is shopping center nearby to escape the heat and the crowd,0

256,256,2.0,So we decided to book a ticket to lotte world during our vacation to Seoul but I was really disappointed about the park Having been to Disneylands I would say lotte world is not even close to being as good as Disneyland I was hyped at first at the entrance wondering about the fun rides the park is going to offer but eventually i was greeted with disappointment when i took a look at the park map Basically the only fun ride was the Atlantis roller coaster and nothing else is that good Plus the place was packed with local students and I had to queue for 3 hours just for the Atlantis ride and trust me it wasnt pleasant at all By the time we completed the ride it was already evening I would say theyre trying to emulate disneyland with the castle and stuffs but boy was i wrong as it wasnt even a fun experience at all Rides were below average some places were not covered with the 1 day pass and of course the massive crowd I dont blame the crowd but rather how small the park is to accommodate the large crowd,0
1068,1068,2.0,If youre planning to go to Lotte World i suggest you not unless youre going for the kids ride only This place is suuuuper crowded even on a Monday So crowded and most rides would cost you minimum 1 hour to 2 hours max waiting in queue  I went there around 10am and i was only able to play 1 ride and that 1 ride had me waited 2 hours in queue Yes it was a fun ride but will i go for another ride and wait for hours Hell no  And the Magic Pass app is a useless app cant reserve any rides at all Wasted my hald day there,0
900,900,2.0,The outdoor park is very small  very limited rides literally a handful only so mainly teens are there and each ride is jampacked  about 70 mins wait per ride This is the 2nd last week of November 2013 The indoor park is much better  however the queue to the interesting ones are long over an hour while the queue for small children are more tolerable Food options in outdoor park is mainly finger food More restaurant options are available in the indoor park Big bugbear for me is that your entrance ticket does not allow you to step out of the park at all Perhaps this is deliberate to get you to patronise from their eateries since there will be much more cheaper and better food options nearby just outside the park I should not have allocated two days of my vacation to hang around this area,0
904,904,2.0,Lotte World looked better at first sight than it actually was First we arrived and had to pay 44000Won for a full day ticket My friend got a credit card discount and the ticket costed him 12 000Won it would be nice to know about those kind of discounts We got disappointed because the ticket itself wasnt a full pass you need to grab at least 30 000Won more to access everything in Lotte world such as Ice ring Magic jungle Horror house or something like that The amusement park rides looked pretty old from near distance also there wasnt many of them altogether Maybe 58 rides for an adult We skipped the rollercoaster right away because of 45min queue There were two nice rides so I wont give 1 star,0

1560,1560,2.0,To be fair we went on a public holiday which is a definate mistake but the place was totally packed It was impossible to walk anywhere just to get through a door way took 5 minutes We queued for 3 hours for the balloon ride which was the only ride we managed to get on all day Every ride had queues of 23 hours The Magic Pass was fully booked by the time we arrived at 1000am I wonder at what point Lotte World Management should stop selling entry tickets  but I guess money speaks louder than patron enjoyment I think this is extremely poorly managed The place is a bit run down and the rides arent really anything we havent seen in Australia We went to Everland 2 days earlier and despite the travel distance and cold factor it is by far the better choice,0
1546,1546,2.0,I have been here twicethe first time is quite exciting as I enjoyed riding all the thrilling gamesGyro DropAtlantis etcbut sadly I have to queue up more than 1 hour just to play 1 of those games Compared to others theme park this is not worth your time as you have to be patience enough just to play a game I went here just because it is famous in drama series like Stairway to Heaven Athena and variety show Running Man Second time I went here it was raining and I can only play indoor games In term of entrance fee it is pricey and not worth it Plus no more discount for foreigner Disappointing,0
1603,1603,2.0,2102012  Every single ride inside Lotte World is minimum wait time of 4060mins The worst experience ever  We tried to get on board of the floating balloon to get a glimpse of whole indoor Lottery World we have to wait close to 2hrs Most of the time got wasted in the queue  Theme park in Korea I strongly recommended Everland in Yongin area It huge and lots of attractions all ages can played and more better value than money  Every patrons were so exhausted tired and very disappointed with the service  WILL,0

1232,1232,3.0,My 2nd visit to Lotte World and this time I booked tickets on weekdays hoping itll not be crowded like all theme parks I was wrong the place is bustling with students and young couples even on a Monday The queue for outdoor rides is worst The snake long queue has at least more than 50 pax for each ride   Theres a queue on almost all the rides even the indoor monorail ride Be prepared to wait at least 45 mins for a 5 mins ride Downloaded the fast pass app and its doesnt work The only consolation is that theres a prayer room and halal kebab food in Lotte World,0
1193,1193,3.0,As with all theme parks its best to go early My sister and I arrived around 11 and spent a bulk of our time queuing for rides Go early and run STRAIGHT to the French Revolution rollercoaster The queue there was TWO HOURS LONG  The indoor theme park is likely to appeal more to younger children with animal mascots and princessdinosaur parades,0
1252,1252,3.0,The theme park did not disappoint in terms of variety of activities but it is packed with many youngsters as it was their public holiday coupled with China golden week holiday The queue started for me to exchange the ticket to enter as I bought the tickets online before I travel The office to do this redemption is too small to handle such a crowd  The rides are fun but the 3D haunted house show was so boring and screen was not clear Need to improve on that The rides were great but simply too Long queue So for about 6 hours spent there we only took 4 rides and 1 3D show  Felt real old among all the youngster Did not stay for the night zombie show but it seems real good and the make up studio for the youngsters are doing a great job getting them ready for the party in the night,0

743,743,3.0,An indoor theme park great for escaping the chilly weather outside There were many rides but with long queue in lines to get to try the rides My niece was forbidden to go to a couple of rides since they have a height requirement it was so sad after we waited for a long queue The outdoor rides in magic island were mostly for adults In one of the rides we saw that there was a short queue in line so we asked one of the staff if we can go inside the staff doesnt speak English well so it was so hard to communicate when we were about to turn our back because we do not understand what she was saying she pulled us in the corner and with few English words she told us that she will help us go inside but we should be quiet about it and keep it as a secret I think that was what she meant  Then she gently pushed us inside When we got inside there was still a queue in line but shorter only to find out that the ride we got into The Comet express was not the ride we want to go to It was like the roller coaster plus the seats rotates 360 degrees we were sooo dizzy We were hoping for a lighter ride but we were thankful to the staff forgot her name she did her best for us to experience the thrill  There were many restaurants and souvenir shops around the theme park There was also a musical show and parade of theme park characters It was a nice experience but i would still prefer Everland to visit again,0
657,657,3.0,1 hour from central this indoor  outdoor park is big with many rides whether you visit in weekend or weekdays it is extremely over crowded with locals you have to wait 3060 minutes for most of the rides we have spent 56 hours and hardly enjoyed 78 rides we have spent whole day standing from one queue to another You have to pay money for many rides and many rides are boring and mostly for kids so not worth standing in queue for long time few restaurants inside,0
1231,1231,3.0,The theme park is big but is not attractive enough for adult to come for second time And sometime need to queue long,0
1203,1203,3.0,Good Attraction but you need to rethink about your trip plan  This is my 2nd time visiting Lotte World bought the discount ticket 30 off from Trip Maker through my guesthouse and I went there on Saturday and omg that was a disaster Arrived there at 11am and left at 8pm 7 hours I have spent almost 4  5 hours ONLY lining up and looked at my phone   No doubt the rides and everythings are cool and entertaining in the Lotte World both indoor and outdoor but there are sooooo many people For the most famous rides like Gyro Spin and Atlantis I have spent 45 mins queuing for each lel  I dont think I need to describe how fun it is in the theme park since they are more or less the same seriously yeah Lotte World makes you feel joyful and excited when you step in the indoor park but for real when you get closer to the ride and once you spot the end of the queue and start lining up and wait for 15 mins and wait for 30 mins still a long way to go I am sure you will get mad I was with my boyfriend and we were getting more tired and even stopped talking  I strongly suggest my fellow travellers try to avoid visit Lotte World on FridaySaturdaySunday  My first visit to Lotte World back in 2014 I paid fullprice and only spent 4 hours there becasue I was so fed up with the queuing Thought it would be better for my revisit after 2 years still the samesmh,0
1224,1224,3.0,As per all other amusement parks the rides are all having very long queue and you need to plan to be there early to start queuing for the rides This park is almost exact copy of Disneyland down to the parades But still is a good park in Seoul if you prefer not to travel to Tokyo which is the nearest for the real one The indoor rides are more for the children and the outdoor rides are actually cater for the teenagers and adult alike Adult ticket cost KRW52000 while teenagers age between 13yo to 18yo cost KRW45000,0
1219,1219,3.0,Nothing special Too pricey Too long a queue for the games wasting time waiting for the ride etc Magic island is probably better with more scenic views,0
682,682,3.0,We went there as 3 families with young children aged from 2 to 8 We had deliberately avoid the weekend and went on a Mon but Lotte world was very crowded My girl aged 8 wanted to try the roller coaster etc but the average waiting time is more than 1 hour Even for the hot air balloon we had to queue for 60 minutes which I feel that it is not worth the wait Most of the time was spent waiting hence it was rather annoying for us  I understand that there is an app which allows us to book the timing in advance but it is not working that well Though it mentioned that the next booking timing but whenever the booking is opened the app will hang and by the time it recovers the booking is closed again  However 1 plus point is that it is air conditioned hence not as hot as other theme parks We did not have enough time to explore the portion outside though we understand there are 2 portions to it  For the younger kids I think they enjoyed the magic show,0
1216,1216,3.0,Found the theme park just ordinary Personally find Disney better off than Lotte World  As I came during winter time Christmas holiday the queue was long and the outdoor activity was closed  Appreciated more if there are more person in charge could speak English or put more sign in English Otherwise it would be a bit trouble some for us who does not speak local language  TK,0
689,689,3.0,The rides are quite ordinary there is long queues due to tour organiser there is not a whole lot you can do the good point is its indoor so the kids can still have fun in a cool air condition area,0
1213,1213,3.0,Conveniently situated near Jamsil Station it has both indoor and outdoor theme park The queues were quite long and you will need to queue more than an hour for popular rides The Cinderella performance for Christmas season was fantastic beautiful costumes and dance routines There is plenty of shopping choices and restaurants right outside the theme park as well  If you are not a fan of rides and do not have patience for queuing then I suggest you give this place a miss,0
1196,1196,3.0,Magic pass is the key to avoid long queues Get the apps in your phone and scan your ticket to ensure smooth entry Highly recommended for free entry Fly Venture Muslim tourists need not worry about halal food Pasha kebab available in the park,0
695,695,3.0,It is a indoor and outdoor park  with rides food food and a mall It costs around 40 for a pone day pass but for some attraction you will need to pay more It did not make sense since we did choose the all day pass with inclusive of attraction The queue are long about 1h30 We went on a week day non holiday period,0

985,985,3.0,The theme park is pretty big with lots of rides and fully indoor so you dont have to worry about the rain Young children in particular would love it here as its really catered for them One regret I had was that I visited on a public holiday so together with tourists local Koreans and their families thronged this place Wished that I had bought the Magic Pass to skip the queues as some rides you will need to wait up to 2 hours long,0
993,993,3.0,The warmth in the indoor theme park was very welcome with the freezing cold outside However the indoor rides were more for smaller kids less than 12 years old probably Very long queues on a holiday and weekend We stayed in an AirBnB across the theme park so transportation was not a problem,0
926,926,3.0,IMHO its better to go Lotte World during winter than Everland because its indoor park can be enjoyed throughly without freezing Nice place with many rides but the queues can be very long What I dont understand is some rides require you to pay to enter even though you have paid the day pass,0
919,919,3.0,We 2 adults went on the eve of their PH And literally all the rides are snaking long we queue arnd 30 mins for the monorail ridesseeing the queues for other rides we gave up and just walk around instead  Will still very much preferred Disney land so do not set too high of a standard before visiting to prevent a huge dissappointment like we do  It is still a wonderful fairy land for the kids to spent the day here though as theres a section cater to the younger kids mini version of bumper car etc  their Pororo land which seems interesting,0
1003,1003,3.0,Went on a Thursday some rides were undergoing maintenance DO CHECK THE APPWEBSITE BEFORE GOING the rides which were down were some of the main rides long queues for the comet express  french revolution 100 mins there is the magic pass app where you get to try your luck to get an express pass at a specific time slot you can do it at the kiosk too The day I went there were many students there making it crowded  almost 90 were students which was really different from my Everland experience  Food selection was decent its not super big but its good and the location is still in the city which makes it convenient and its near lotte mart for food shopping,0
898,898,3.0,Chose Lotte World over Everland due to cold weather and that rides in Everland was not running 100 as the day temperatures were below 0C Distance was also a deciding factor and the fact that Lotte World boast to be the largest indoor theme park in the world attracted us to it  Fairly easy to get to the park via the Seoul Subway Ticketing and entry was relatively smooth Unknown to us the period when we were visiting coincided with the high school holidays thus resulting in very large numbers of teenagers Both the indoor and outdoor rides have an average waiting time of about 90 minutes with some going as long as 120 minutes Now here is the bad thing about Lotte World or any other theme parks in Korea Queue cuttingjumping is an accepted practice here I read about it on some theme parks forums but couldnt believe the extent or severity of it until I was there to witness it myself Example the person in front of you will at some point of time either by texting on their handphone or shouting at their friends will invite his or her friends to join him in the queue It could be as little as just one person to as much as 10 people This happens at all the rides and is rampant even with the theme park officials helping the queue jumpers get to their friend that was already in the queue It was simply unacceptable and appalling for nonKoreans visitors  On the way out meet a theme park official and gave them feedback on the problem of queue cuttingjumping The theme park was apologetic and understood my frustrations and offered another day of free entry as a form of goodwill gesture We took up the offer and faced the same problems the next day   Connected to the Lotte World is a shopping mall that offers quite an extensive selections of shops and eateries An alternative for those who wish to take a break from the theme park Take note though Lotte World entry passes does not allow for reentry after leaving the theme park area,0
896,896,3.0,We were there for about 6 hours Add point is it is easily accessible by subway and not easily missed due to the ample signage along the station Given that you are not distracted by the shopping arcade along the way It was on a Friday that we went to check it out It was pretty crowded with tourists school children and local people However the longer queue took only 30 minutes Our kids loved the theme park especially the Camelot Carousel World monorail kids bumper cars and train rides However we were disappointed that the balloon rides for small kids were under maintenance We suggested family with small kids should do some homework prior visiting There were rides that need accompany and most of the rides require kids to be above 110cm It means if you have a 3 yearold he might not get to play those rides he wants to even with accompany,0
895,895,3.0,So yes very much your typical theme park We gave up waiting in line and left the kids to a full day of queuing Amazing how kids who are continually bored are prepared to stand around for hours for a few seconds thrill  Some of the queues were taking up to 2 hours Outside was much better than indoors but overall nobody would visit again Geared very much to the local market,0
893,893,3.0,First time visited an underground themepark Staffs are friendly but not all Visited there during winter so some of the attractions are closed  Most of the rides need to queue for super long around an hour But overall experience was good,0
890,890,3.0,Took a good look at the infamous iceskating rink as seen in Boys over Flowers and that was it Did not take a single ride the entire 4 hours that I was there It was part of a package tour because every ride had a snaking queue which meant a wait of at least 45 mins on average Most of the rides are meant for kids except a few like Gyro Drop which is located at the outdoor section Nice place to stay for 12 hrs but not a place Id go back to again unless I have kids with me,0
1070,1070,3.0,As a foreigner you can get very cheap tickets from Trip Advisor Klook etc We got some from Govoyagin for 28000 The problem we found was that it didnt include the three Magic Passes which enables you to skip the queue using either an app or the vending machine outside the ride Going on Lunar New Year Eve it was particularly crowded and most of our time was spent in queues There was even a hot air balloon ride inside much like a Ferris wheel really which had a queue of 100 mins In sum it was interesting cute had some cool VR rides did the three Wild ones but it was an exhausting day PS Skip the haunted mansion Wasnt worth the extra 6000 won,0
884,884,3.0,This is a wonderful playground for young kids The queues are very long on weekends but admiring the colourful indoor and outdoor theme parks is already quite a joy You cant compare it with Disneyland or Universal Studios though This is just Seouls famous theme park for the young and young at heart The admission and the restaurants are quite pricey I will not return on my future trips  been there done that just for the experience,0
1082,1082,3.0,Lotte Adventure World is a haven for parents with kids 12 and below as everything there is made for the little ones It is a onestopshop and playground for parents who dont hv to fret about children being bored However the queue to every ride takes about 6070minutes For those with toddlers the queues are shorter in the section for tiny tots The services offered to parents are ample It is a brightlylit place with lots of colour but for teens n adults the surging crowds and noise level there can grate on your nerves,0
863,863,3.0,We went to the Lotte World on Sunday and bought the after 4 special pass tickets since it was cheaper We pay for only 26000 won instead of 46000 won for full day pass As expected the place was packed with people esp some local teenagers Luckily the queueing was acceptable 2030 mins for indoor games and we had the opportunity to enjoy almost all of it However the queueing was crazy long for the outdoor games 5090 mins and we only managed to enjoyed the lame swing tree ride  There is a big carnival parade around the central before the park closed it was pretty fun with lots of people in colourful costumes dancing around Overall it was a good place to having fun and pretend youre in Disneyland,0
1085,1085,3.0,Wasnt a very good experience as I came in winter Most of the rides were closed so the remaining rides that are opened had very long queues I took a total of 2 rides in the entire afternoon with a one and half hour queue time each  However what Ive observed is that itll be a great place for kids in winter Lots of kiddy rides thats indoor away from the harsh winter air  Will recommend coming in other seasons,0
855,855,3.0,This is easier to access compared to Everland if you do not want to spend too much time travelling First of all spend some time to search out discount coupons which can amount to 50 There are apps like Coupangs that offer discounted tickets Prepare to spend time waiting in queue 40 mins to  1 hour for popular rides and there are about 45 of them in the outdoor area not recommended in the winter months as it will be very cold standing out waiting Indoor rides are mainly for the younger children,0
1625,1625,3.0,It is a good disney miniature but you wont be able to imagine how fully packed is this place during school holiday You will spend time only to queue,0
1133,1133,3.0,1 hour from central this indoor  outdoor park is big with many rides whether you visit in weekend or weekdays it is extremely over crowded with locals you have to wait 3060 minutes for most of the rides we have spent 56 hours and hardly enjoyed 78 rides we have spent whole day standing from one queue to another You have to pay money for many rides and many rides are boring and mostly for kids so not worth standing in queue for long time few restaurants inside,0

774,774,3.0,Good Attraction but you need to rethink about your trip plan  This is my 2nd time visiting Lotte World bought the discount ticket 30 off from Trip Maker through my guesthouse and I went there on Saturday and omg that was a disaster Arrived there at 11am and left at 8pm 7 hours I have spent almost 4  5 hours ONLY lining up and looked at my phone   No doubt the rides and everythings are cool and entertaining in the Lotte World both indoor and outdoor but there are sooooo many people For the most famous rides like Gyro Spin and Atlantis I have spent 45 mins queuing for each lel  I dont think I need to describe how fun it is in the theme park since they are more or less the same seriously yeah Lotte World makes you feel joyful and excited when you step in the indoor park but for real when you get closer to the ride and once you spot the end of the queue and start lining up and wait for 15 mins and wait for 30 mins still a long way to go I am sure you will get mad I was with my boyfriend and we were getting more tired and even stopped talking  I strongly suggest my fellow travellers try to avoid visit Lotte World on FridaySaturdaySunday  My first visit to Lotte World back in 2014 I paid fullprice and only spent 4 hours there becasue I was so fed up with the queuing Thought it would be better for my revisit after 2 years still the samesmh,0
765,765,3.0,Seoul must go to amusement park to rival Disneyland Have most of the rides you would want including virtual reality and 3D 4D shows There is a large indoor area where around twothirds of the rides and attractions with the outdoor Magic Island accommodating the others We went on a public holiday in Korea where foreigners get a 50 discount but unfortunately We bought the day pass which was normally priced at KRW 52000 it was so crowded and queues typically had a waittime of between 23 hours crazy It was also stuffy and after a while inside we were dying for some fresh air We were there for only 4 hours and managed just one ride  the Fly Venture If you really want to enjoy the place best to plan ahead arrive really early in the morning If you dont like crowds especially packed indoors this is not the place for you The subway station for Lotte World is Jamsil Lines 2 and 8,0

756,756,3.0,We went on a weekend Overcrowded with people and queue ranging up to 30mins for rides  They have an outdoor and indoor theme park Indoor rides are less exciting Outdoor rides are heartpumping  There are restaurants and cafes as well as souvenirs shops in the theme park  This theme park is more for kids and young people Not suitable for middleaged and above,0
788,788,3.0,Visited with 3 teens and 2 children age 7  9 on Friday Very crowded and seems there is no restrictions to number of visitors Average waiting time for rides were 60mins and above some were closed The teens wanted to take the most popular ride  French Revolution were required to queue for 260mins and Magic Pass were fully taken by 1pm They gave up queuing Therefore from 127pm the teens only managed to take 3 rides and the kiddos was about 4 and each ride took less then 3mins,0

1504,1504,3.0,a very big theme park with indoor and outdoor facilities easily accessible by metro took us about 30 mins from hongik univ station which the distance is so much nearer to Everland very easy to find the theme park once you are out of the station the signage were adequate in my opinion even if you dont understand korean there were parades fixed at certain timing which you can enjoy by standing at the side inside the indoor theme park there is a small version of trick eye museum we spent about 15 mins to complete the pictures dont expect much though  once stepped outside to the outdoor theme park the first impression was totally feels like Disneyland the layout and colors were very similar queues for rides were about 30 minutes since I went on a weekday  overall the theme park is reasonably entertaining cater 30 kids 70 adults 7 hours inside the theme park is more than enough including lunch and queue,0

341,341,3.0,The place is huge and the best thing about it is that most rides are indoors We didnt even realize that it had been raining for most of the day till we rode the train at Jamsil station the station is connected to the mall and got off Myeongdong station  I yawned through most of the rides and the queues were extremely long as we were there on a weekend The kids ages 9 and 10 enjoyed themselves though They got to enjoy VR rides that gave them the impression they were riding actual roller coasters Other underground rides they found too scary so we spent most of our time at Wild Tours located on 1F,0
332,332,3.0,We accidentally went the day after Childrens Day so there were lots of school groups It was quite tricky to find our way to the right queues as we didnt know the name of the rides or which floor they started on Several rides had wait times of over 2 hours which we were not prepared to wait for,0

1529,1529,3.0,Lotte World is divided into three parts Lotte World Adventure Lotte World Waterpark and Lotte World Aquarium I went to Lotte World Adventure and it consist of four levels of indoor adventures and linked to an outdoor theme park called Magic Island No doubt some of the rides were the main attractions there but the day went I visited was peak and it was a Monday They have two types of tickets Daily Passport Ticket full day and after 4pm admission and Admission Only Ticket full day after 4pm and after 7pm admission It gets cheaper for later passes I advise you to purchase onsite to prevent any mistakes because it includes admission to some other parts like the museum where I dont know where it that plus you might be give tourists discounts  During March to April they feature the Mask Festival where its a world of fantastic masks along with the vibrant spirit of spring plus a Masquerade parade at selected timings The worse part of the trip was most of the rides had to stop at 8pm for fireworks for 30mins That also means youll be in the queue before 8pm and queue for 30mins  1hour or whichever the waiting time for the ride What frustrates me even more was the staff stopped me from entering and explained to me that theres fireworks but yet allowed Koreans to enter the queue though theres communication barrier but actions spoke louder than words That staff even screamed at me as he have to repeat multiple times that I have to wait after 830pm Bad service  Read up on my Korea trip on httpnkikichuablogspotsg201408wanderlustseoulkoreaday7coexmallhtml,0

1556,1556,3.0,We tried to visit Lotte World on a weekday hoping that the crowd size should be manageable but we were wrong The queue for each of the rides took at least an hour and we spent more than 70 of our time in Lotte a World queuing than enjoying the rides The carnival theme park atmosphere exuded fun Some of the thrilling rides did live up to my expectation If you are interested to visit Lotte World but be prepared to spend at least 8 hours with half the time queuing for rides,0
1558,1558,3.0,Good combination of indoor and outdoor activities But the long queueing time and average thrill rides make this a rather old and tired attraction Have seen better rides in recent times and Lotte World seriously needs an upgrade  But the location is easily accesible from Jamsil station and provides a nice getaway for tourists who prefer not to take the long 2hour journey to Everland,0

1594,1594,3.0,I was at Lotte World after 4pm following a tour package on 16 December with my 10 year old kid As it was cold outdoor we stayed at the indoor themepark area Most rides which we wanted to go for like 4D theater and Bumper Car were all closed for maintenance We queued 30 minutes for the monorail only to realise that it circles the indoor area only not the indoor and outdoor area as we expected The hotair balloon ride queue was so long that it says 60 minutes wait so we did not attempt to queue for it  We wanted fast food fried chicken for dinner and were told that we had to wait for 30 minutes for the chicken to be ready  Maybe because it was a Sunday night it was way too crowded long queues for minimal attractions that were open indoor and long queues for food Spent 4 hours there but didnt seemed to have accomplished much except doing the Singbad ride Desperado cowboy shooting monorail watched 7pm parade and had fastfood dinner  The parade was the only more interesting event with a Christmas mood,0

561,561,3.0,Outdoor rides were all closed Thus the queue for the indoor rides were crazily long  I would go again in spring or summer probably,0
1595,1595,4.0,I visited this place twice Once 3 years ago and another in 3 days ago In both trips nothing much changes except for the weather  The entire amusement park comprises of both indoor and outdoor areas both have great mixture of ridesattractions for young kids teenager or adults that are young at heart  Food are easily available around though I hope that there are a greater variety for fast food This is very important because of the terrible queues that plague every theme park One can save plenty of time if he queue and eat at the same time  The entire place is quite compact but yet spacious enough to avoid being claustrophobic So one do not need to travel vast distances to get from one point of a park to another,1
1017,1017,4.0,Long queues everywhere and it is quite confusing to use their app to book the timeslot for the rides as there are no instructions on how to book for foreigners  Aside from that it is quite interesting and fanciful Theres restaurants and shops inside for you to shop your worth while you are there,1
1002,1002,4.0,Went on a Wednesday morning but it was so packed with Korean teenagers many in school uniform It makes me wonder if that was a school excursion or it is a trend to visit theme Parks in school uniforms  We reached there exactly at 930am and when the doors were opened teenagers starting sprinting towards the rides and queues began to form  Not intending to wait too Long for rides we each paid 40000 won for the 5 rides express pass The counter for express pass is located behind the famous Carousel ride A paper band will be tied around your wrist Just show the band to the personnel at the express ride queue and they will mark on the wrist band Choose to use the wrist band wisely Some rides have queues that move quite fast Eg the pirate ship ride which allows 60 riders or more per rid so one should not use the wrist band here The express pass is really useful for rides that have queues up to 1h Long Atlantis and French Revolution have Super Long queues and these are reall high intensity fun rides Use your express pass here Gyro Swing is another ride which has ridiculously Long queue  Dont forget to go to level 23 where there is a photography area with many feature walls to take nice instragammable photos,1
996,996,4.0,Lotte World is a large indoor theme park covering multi stories and including an outdoor area The rides range from kiddie rides through to relatively large roller coasters that older kids will love If youre coming in winter be prepared to layer on and off if youre going to be in or outside  Best to arrive first thing when the crowds are small and queues are short  go to the most popular rides first  Atlantis French Revolution Pharaohs Rage etc otherwise be prepared to queue for up to 2 hours when the crowd builds up especially in the holiday season  The park is clean and well presented and offers a Disneyeque feel complete with their own Snow White Castle  The entry ticket we got 20 off using MasterCard is generally all inclusive a small handful of rides require extra payment There is a range of food from local to western Prices are generally higher than outside  There is a Lotte World app that can book Magic Passes like Disney fast passes but we couldnt get them to work perhaps they need to be booked first thing So suggest some preplanning is essential to get the best out of the park,1
1226,1226,4.0,We went on a Saturday and started off with the outdoor rides Just 2 rides have already spent 4 hrs queuing Many rides and attractions both indoor and outdoor but the long queue requires lots of patience and self entertainment while queuing Downloaded the Apps for Quickpass but it is useless as it is always full every 15 mins Not recommended for weekend,1
1236,1236,4.0,Just like any theme park be prepared to wait in queue Popular with locals and tourists Could spend up to a day at this place Some outdoor rides are more suitable for teenagers,1
978,978,4.0,We visited Lotte World during our recent trip to Seoul Great for all ages I like both indoor and outdoor rides Negative points Queueing was 100 minutes for one ride We didnt ride any of the popular rides because the queues were 90 to 110mins per ride This is a whole world of entertainment Outside park inside entertainment food hall and shopping  mall,1
1613,1613,4.0,The lady at the counter encouraged us to get the express ticket which we did But somehow we couldnt use it inside for most of the rides So I felt like we paid extra for nothing  We only tried the outdoor rides as the indoor one was really crowded However we caught the Peterpan show and my son loves it The characters actually come down from the stage to pose for pictures with you and shake hands etc that was lovely  My 4 year old son enjoyed himself at the amusement park and that alone makes the tickets and queues worth it ,1
1272,1272,4.0,So we decided after venturing to the Aquarium to try out the adventure world it is definately a place where everyone goes its in the place to be  Warning the weekends best to avoid think all locals come down for a great time and its a great time but be prepared for the very long queues but you can purchase a Maxi pass thats like a jump the queue,1
1584,1584,4.0,My family  i have been to some big themeamusement parks and i find that Lotte World is another dreamland for kids Initially we wanted to go to Everland but given the time constraint we opted for Lotte World instead Most of its attractions are indoor pity that we didnt try outdoor as we spent too much time inside Even spent half day inside we still didnt manage to cover most of the indoor attractions due to queuing for some rides Lucky that we went on Monday where queues were not too long I had so much fun riding the rides with my little nephew and to see that he enjoyed so much he refused to leave There is a nice parade show twice a day but we missed the garden show  laser show Suggest to spend one full day if intend to visit Lotte World,1
1309,1309,4.0,Easy to reach by metro However the place is not as big and queues are long with some taking more than 60 mins we went on a Monday Surprisingly the food is quite nice,1
1222,1222,4.0,We went to Lotte World last Dec 24 As expected there were long lines before you can take the ride Waiting time is around 60 minutes for a 5 minute ride There are attractions that you have to pay extra even if you get an all day pass My 9 year old son was able to get in 5 attractions because of the long queue He decided to do ice skate instead,1
1575,1575,4.0,Must visit if you go to Korea with young children and toddler unlike many other amusement park theres a lot of rides that my 7 and 2 year old can enjoy mostly without even queueing yay Most rides are indoor but dont miss the outdoor Magic island rides which provides more options for older children and adult  The Pororo Park on the basement same floor with the ice skating ring provides a special place where toddler can run around freely and enjoy rides designed for their early age The fact that they limit 2 hours per visitor makes it even better as they get to enjoy most rides without even queueing Too bad pororo and all their friend does not come in live and do their dancing very often got to see only eddy and crong and my toddler is a bit disappointed,1
1596,1596,4.0,Lotte World is relatively cheap to get in we got tickets for 29000 won each You do need to pay for a few rides inside but we felt that was ok The rides on Magic Island were great the Gyro Drop was terrifying  Inside the balloon ride was lovely we did have to queue for an hour for it though The French Revolution roller coaster was incredible also an hour queue though  The Christmas parade was one of the best things I have ever seen A very weird take on Christmas and it was so good I got a bit teary The actors were amazing and very friendly It must be such a brilliant job  Only issues we had were the queue lengths and as we are vegetarian the food Ye gods dont remind me of the food  Brilliant day out though we had so much fun,1
1220,1220,4.0,Our children totally enjoyed our 6 hours stay there Advice to buy express queue to save time  Was informed that we can enjoy all rides at the park however some of the rides need additional entrance fee,1
1548,1548,4.0,we visited this theme park on saturday and it was really crowded there was long queue but the location is in seoul and not too far for dongdaemun where i stayed i just tried 23 attraction watched the show this theme park is divided into outdoor and indoor areafor adrenalin junkies this theme park will be dissapointed because not too many thrilling rides most of them in outdoor area the interior is larger than the exterior and nicer you can buy ticket for admission ticket just for visit or day pass ticket you can try most of rides visit museum but you have to pay another ticket to visit pororo park or night time day pass ticket usually for foreigner there is discount ticket to visit this park just check the website for discount coupon or some visit korea website but you cant buy the ticket from machine if you want to use your discount coupon no need to queue if you buy ticket from machine this theme park is connected with mall hotel there is duty free in up floor ticket just for one visit only once you exit from the park you can go back except you buy another ticket,1
1189,1189,4.0,This is an outdoor amusement park with indoor theme park like Disneyland  The indoor theme park has a few 3D shows which are very exciting not to be missed  The queue for the rides in the outdoor park was quite long and we waited for an average of 45 minutes for the rides  Be prepared to spend a day here as there are many fun things to do here,1
1399,1399,4.0,There have indoor and outdoor themepark conceptsThere every day opening hour 10am until 10pm Inside also have small stall can shopping walk aroundIf peak season waiting rides may take more time to queue,1
1185,1185,4.0,This is one of the place you need to visit when you are in Korea it has a lot of rides dedicated to all kind of ages However a great tip to avoid long queues and crowds is to go there when it is not their school holidays or any kinds of holiday,1
1416,1416,4.0,If you like theme parks a bit sickly sweat and tung in check then this is great We went in the evening so there were lots of teenagers and the queues for the rides were 40 minutes to a hour long Only did a couple of the rides but they were good Doing rollercoasters in the dark was a first for me and I quite liked it The place shuts at 2200 It is quite expensive but if you have a local friend then certain banks and organisations can get you a big discount we payed a third of the asking price by paying io a local bank card There are also lots of rides for younger children and there was a big childrens show on in the evening,1
1396,1396,4.0,Lots of rides and different activities performance to see and do that will definitely keep your kids entertained and you constantly on your feet trying to keep up with them However like any popular theme places in Seoul best to avoid weekends or public holidays to maximise your enjoyment otherwise be ready to handle accept the crowd and long queues We have been to lotte world about 5 times now over a period of 7 years and my boys have enjoyed every visit,1
1197,1197,4.0,Make sure to go during the offpeak period to avoid long queues for rides We managed to take quite many rides and repeated ones as it was not KR school holidays yet I am surprised with the quality of food was good at Lotte World although slightly pricey but really quite alright Do not pitch it against Disney not quite the same  but good enough It will take you one full day  so make sure you have the time,1
1378,1378,4.0,If you visit Korea and youre either an amusement park aficionado or have kids go to Lotte World Amusement Park The usual guidelines go EARLY and Theres always a discount coupon available that is dont pay full price Although it got quite crowded in the afternoon the queues in the morning were reasonable when we went We often got a bit lost but eventually we found helpful directional signs The stage shows had surprisingly welltrained Russian dancers in absurd costumes and kiddie narration in Korean The food and souvenirs were reasonably priced and there were plenty of places to sit or stand and get your bearings The ice rink at the bottom served as an orienting and comforting center to the place In all it is stunning to have such a space in the middle of a huge metropolis Plan to spend the whole day and more,1
1209,1209,4.0,Lots to do and the tickets are good value However the queues were simply horrendous Average of 90 minutes to 2 hours for each ride We downloaded the app to book rides according to time slots but there was an online queue too My kid did enjoy it and the balloon rides over the whole park is great for young children,1
1507,1507,4.0,This place is a one spot centre for family with teen vacation the park was awesome though it quite tiring to explore the whole outdoor amusement game and it will for sure take a long queue in line for each of it but its so worth it best time to visit not in the winter because when i came in lotte world the weather is freezing cold We need to warm up most of the time at the warmer port they provided at the outdoor park For the inside park the ride its fun for the young children mostly less adrenaline ride,1
1211,1211,4.0,This is the 2nd time visiting so not much excitement There are indoor and outdoor theme parks Went on weekend the place was packed with local and foreigners The popular rides are 2 hour queue There are many food outlets where you can have your meals Spend a whole day here to get your money worth The parade at 8 pm Is nearer than Everland if you dont have time in Seoul,1
1147,1147,4.0,This is one of the famous amusement park in Korea esp in Seoul It has both outdoor and indoor attraction I really enjoyed playing in here even one day was not enough They has full of wifi area everywhere and I needed it so much that time  they offered an application on phone for us so that we dont need to queueing up for long time in every attraction but unfortunately there were some attraction that didnt work when I went there but I want to go there again next time,1
1508,1508,4.0,I went here twice in December 2011 and January 2013 It was really great We spent the whole day day bcos there were indoor and outdoor rides For the pupillary rides make sure you go early and reserved a queue number That way you dont have to queue very long Its usually limited and only for certain rides The reservation is always located near the intended ride Try the gyro drop I think thats one of the popular onessorry but I chickened out Haha I came compared this park to everland cos Ive never been to the latter  anyway youll enjoy yourself Just avoid gg on oeak holidays,1
1517,1517,4.0,bit pricey due to the long queues you can only get on a limited number of attractions in one day however the folk museum is brilliant dont miss it,1
1522,1522,4.0,We went on a Saturday and the queues were very long Magic passes helped Would probably have enjoyed it more if there were shorter lines for the rides The big thrill rides were too brief for me and were over too soon Didnt bring kids with me this time but kids would really love this place Good food also,1
1365,1365,4.0,I went here with my friends and we were amazed by its huge size One day is not enough to tour all the attraction especially with the long queue on the rides sometimes it took us one hour before we can get into rides it is really time consuming so i suggest if you have the budget  book in their hotel for 2 days to maximize your visit Good thing we were able to get cheap ticket 60 discount There were also lot of restaurant to choose from and they have lotte mart to shop which we did before leaving the park You will really enjoy coming here as it is indoor with an air condition so no problem if it rains,1
1523,1523,4.0,We went there as it was known as the biggest indoor theme park the problem with theme parks is the long queues to get on the good rides,1
1346,1346,4.0,When we reached lotte world the parade has just begun We took a lot of pictures as they are very beautiful and unique  The queue to the rides are not the long so we ride as many as we can However some of the rides close early  Do wear comfortable shoes as you will walk a lot,1
1319,1319,4.0,Lotte world was fun and exciting Loved the roller coasters Outdoors will be more fun for teenagers However long queues everywhere Be expected to wait 2 hours  during peak periods,1
1317,1317,4.0,A fun  interesting place with both indoor and outdoor rides Great for kids to enjoy but be prepared to queue for some of the rides Outdoor rides might be closed during winter depending on weather conditions,1
1253,1253,4.0,Had a good time spending half a day with friends in Lotte World The place was big There were indoor and outdoor sections Indoor section was more childfriendly Outdoor section was more for the thrillseekers The parade was fun Do visit in the morning as soon as it open to avoid long queues,1
1626,1626,4.0,Lots of fun in a compact venue with some great rides In winter you are limited to the inside which is a shame because all the fun is outside There are some great rides that are all very close together and queues are manageable You can also get reservations to come back at a set time and save yourself from a long wait in exchange for a short one still maybe 1015 minutes Lots of fun for all ages,1
958,958,4.0,I went with three friends and had a great time There is several fun attractions with all different levels of thrill They have a super fast but short roller coaster and also a pretty scary free drop outside they also have their daily parade and shows on stage  In the Center inside they have an iceskating rink which is always appreciated The only thing that I didnt like was the burger with fries and sometimes the queue can be a bit long,1
725,725,4.0,We spotted this while roaming around the Lotte shopping area Though it was 4pm but we decided to go in and explore this indoor and outdoor adventure park We even got a discount as they offer discounts after 4pm on the day Pass There was a waiting of almost 3045 mins on all the popular rides but it was worth waiting in the queue We loved the V R roller coaster and air balloon ride If you have the patience of waiting for 45 mins per ride then its definitely worth buying a day pass to spend a few hours in th evening Outdoor theme park is also beautiful with lots of rides and amazing view of cherry blossom in the spring season,1
714,714,4.0,Lotte World is a park that is different than any other youve been to before Most of the park is located in a huge mall with rides stuck in the walls of several different floors There is also a small outdoor section that maximizes its space by going underground Lotte World is not short on attractions but there is no single wow attraction there  a lot of good ones but no marquee Thats the one complaint I have about the park Many of the rides are out of the box purchases from ride manufacturers The rides are in no way modified and just plopped down here or there With all of the rides though how do you make it through everything in a day Use the Lotte World app to book Fastpass times throughout the day You get 3 free ones a day Depending on what you like you should make your choices some combination of Atlantis French Revolution Comet Express Flume and Pharaohs Fury These rides get the longest queues Furthermore youll likely have to cut some rides out because of the volume of stuff there is to do To me the must do attractions are Atlantis Comet Express Pharaohs Fury Adventures of Sinbad and Aeronauts Balloon Ride The rides that get a lot of attention but you can skip are French Revolution Flume and the Conquistador The rides that dont get a lot of attention but you shouldnt miss are Castle Magic Show Fantasy Dream Jungle Adventure and Fly Venture,1
683,683,4.0,This is one of the famous amusement park in Korea esp in Seoul It has both outdoor and indoor attraction I really enjoyed playing in here even one day was not enough They has full of wifi area everywhere and I needed it so much that time  they offered an application on phone for us so that we dont need to queueing up for long time in every attraction but unfortunately there were some attraction that didnt work when I went there but I want to go there again next time,1
280,280,4.0,We got our tickets online with a magic pass 5 options Basically you can choose 5 rides and cut the queues without having to book the timing like the magic pass on the main website The entrance tickets are also discounted on the third party website Apparently it is a promotion only for foreigners So you have to bring your passport  The park itself was great fun There were lots of rides for all thrill levels both indoors and outdoors Atlantis Gyro Drop and French Revolution were some of the more thrilling rides I remember riding Definitely worth using the pass for If you visiting with young kids I did see there were some rides that were only for young kids The park really caters to all ages  For the Instagram mets there was also an area inside near the VR attractions for taking selfies The selfie studio is set up with sets and props as well as tripods for rent We loved taking pictures with the various backdrops  We happened to be there for Halloween so there was also costume rentals and face painting extra costs near the entrance There was even a haunted house set up Not to forget the Halloween parade We saw that they even has some of the park guests who were dressed as princesses participate  Lots of food affordable food available as well Food stalls as well as set restaurants and food courts were available all over the park There seems to have been no issues about bringing your own too We brought in our own water  When it was time to go we exited into the Mall and we glad to find that there was a Lotte Mart around the corner of the exit So manage to squeeze in a little grocery shopping before having to head back  Overall I felt it was a fun place to visit for the whole family,1
667,667,4.0,Loved the rides at Lotte World My friends and I went on a Saturday and some queues for rides were rather long French Revolution had a waiting time of 60mins For daredevils please do try out the Gyro Drop It may seem intimidating I was regretting while waiting for the ride to start but it was a superb unforgettable experience And best of all there wasnt a queue  Best part about lotte world is the indoor park where you can take shelter in when the weather is too warm or it starts to rain,1
629,629,4.0,So heres the facts you need to consider  Best to go during the week whereby you can purchase tickets at a lower cost Next Arrive as close to opening time as you can to ensure short lines If not happy about long lines purchase a Magic Pass a fair bit more expensive that takes you to the front of the queue Note that once queues build up substantially  which they do  many of the rides close the expensive Magic Pass In other words get there the earlier the better Weekends are terribly busy meaning long lines  Lotte World truly caters for all ages not necessarily those over 65 who Lotte World believe are too old to go on some of the rides with a myriad of toddler child and adult rides  Now to what really upsets me Youd think that the entry fee would cover everything aside from food etc of course Well it doesnt Indeed there are many areas requiring you to spend extra Take the Ice Rink for example it is completely autonomous to the adventure park even though it is right in the middle of it  You can have a great day at Lotte It really comes down to what you make of it,1
286,286,4.0,We decided to go to this park on a whim Lotte world is the biggest indoor theme park in the world It is at the edge of the lotte department store at Jamsil station If you buy an online ticket you need to walk all the way around the park to the southern gate and then enter that side It doesnt matter where you leave your bags as the lockers are accessible from several exits of the park  The park extends outdoors and there are some events centred around halloween Specifically the indoor haunted house is not very scary but the outdoor house with entry fee of 5000 won is very scary 55 spooks Rules involved Dont let go of the rope no running dont blind the actors The wait times in the park are so mixed and with a ticket you only get to reserve 3 rides I didnt really like this system as some rides are reservation only and can run out very fast I recommend you book asap for a ride that looks interesting as we missed out on both of the massive indoor roller coasters operating that day Furthermore the outdoor 3 biggest coasters were all closed for maintenance A wait time under 30 minutes is tolerable and not worth wasting a magic pass on The staff were also mind enough to let my friend and I into the same ride even though she was in the reserved session after mine  My other big complaint is that staff are very unprofessional and let their friends into rides ahead of the queue There was a halloween show that started 6pm and two friends went in to chat with their mate despite the sign saying it is dangerous for individuals It also seems impossible to access the ice skating rink without leaving the park Some staff tell you to leave if youre a foreigner to use the outside escalstor and you wont be let back into the park,1
291,291,4.0,We went in at 10 am which was the opening time but there was already a long queue in front of entrance Soooo many students since it was summer holidays  We knew what we wanted to go for so ran to French revolution as soon as we entered One of the most popular rides We rode within 10 mins and went on to next one Pirates ship managed to ride within 15 mins  We tactfully chose the rides with shorter queue and could ride many rides for the first few hours It was possible because I am very familiar with rides and how to go about If you are to come in in the afternoon I strongly suggest 2 ways to shorten your queue time  I am not talking about buying ridiculously expensive fast passes Something you can do for free  Lotte world uniquely offer 3 fast access using their own App Magic pass App Of course you will want to have more than 3 passes since there are many popular ones but better than nothing  You first need to scan or manually register your entrance tickets on App Press reserve ride Each ride opens up every 15 mins to choose time slot Within seconds slots will be gone It is difficult to explain here Once you try to use App you will get the hang of it soon  If you are not very technical person or have slow finger I would suggest another way Know what you want to ride and go there At each entrance of ride you will see ticket reservation machine Simply scan your ticket then it will give out next available time slot Bring that paper at given time and go to fast pass way  Only downside of this method is you need to physically go to ride and scan your tickets If your 3 rides are all scattered around you need to walk around so much I suggest you to choose 3 rides relatively close to each other  Atlantis French revolution pirates ship and gyro drop are the musttrys There were 3 horror houses but I didnt try since my 2 kids were too scared to go in The most popular one was at magic island which is outdoor Its a shame that you need to pay 5000 won to go in  There are many variety of restaurants to choose from Korean Japanese Chinese and burgersetc Many stalls sell Lottel world goods and desserts  Lotte world rides can entertain from toddlers to teenagers They have more indoor rides than outdoor ones Perfect for rainy days We stayed until 4 pm and rode most of the rides using App and reservation machines Without a plan you could wait for hours for each ride so plan well ahead,1
293,293,4.0,Spent my birthday at Lotte World Adventure and I must say that this place exceeded my expectations I was concerned that it would be more suitable for young children and whilst there are really a lot of rides and attractions catered towards a children and a younger audience there were plenty of things for adults to entertain themselves with with as well  Unfortunately we went on a super wet and rainy day and could not try all the rides on the Magic Island what they call the outdoor area because they all closed once it started pouring Thankfully there is a relatively large and pleasant indoor area but we had to queue for ages for the indoor rides  My advice before going to Lotte World is to plan your visit well Decide which rides or attractions you want to visit and consider if its worth investing in the Magic Passes We spent most of our day queueing and it can get quite frustrating to stand in lines for 5060 minutes at a time The Magic Passes would save time for sure but if Im not mistaken you still need to fight for certain ride slots Do check that you arent going on a public or school holiday in S Korea and do avoid weekends We went on a random Thursday  to our knowledge there were no holidays but still the place was packed with school children and teenagers  Another tip  dont miss the Folk Museum It was actually a really impressive museum and we enjoyed exploring the exhibits,1
573,573,4.0,Very nice place to be with children However the queue is very long for the popular rides and I think will be more worth if purchase the magicpass,1
559,559,4.0,the largest indoor playground in asia with various types of games that are indoor or outdoor providing a variety of food games and attractions as well as exciting performances to follow very long queue open until 2200,1
546,546,4.0,I visited Lotte World as group of friends in January 2018 It was the coldest month in Seoul since the temperature drop to 18 but we managed to enjoy the theme park especially the Magic Island outdoor area The indoor area more focused on childrens and youngers attractions For thrill seeker like us we spent the whole day in outdoor area The good things about Lotte World is the queues is managable and almost all the outdoor games are open even tho its winter We reccomend the gyro drop gyro swing atlantis adventure they excluded the water since its winter and bunge drop for all thrill seeker out there Its worth to try those attraction when you visit Seoul Dont be afraid of the cold because theres a lot heaters in outdoor area If you bought the ticket beforehand through online platform etc you need to exchange the QR code to physical ticket through the South Gate Entrance Theres drinking station in almost all food hall If you want to visit the Lotte World half day you can get a cheaper price by buying the half day ticket but I still reccomend you to visit this park early in the morning or noon and enjoy this park until evening because theres illumination in the castle area,1
972,972,4.0,Came on a week day but there were loads of people glad we took the tickets with the magic pass and saved a lot of time from queueing overall had a great time,1
544,544,4.0,Enjoyable place to have nice time especially if with kids Many interesting attractions are available Easily accessible Better to enter early in the morning and buy full day ticket In such case you will not need to make additional payments for most attractions and wait less in queues,1
541,541,4.0,Had a fun afternoonevening with friends  A few tips  Tickets are normally 55000 won but you can get discounted tickets on Klook for 28000 won with the option to get the Magic Pass x 3 or 5 for an additional 22000  34000 won  which I would highly recommend  If you do buy tickets on Klook you enter via the South gate  The Magic Pass lets you skip the queue which most of the main rides had a wait time of 15  2 hours  Dont download the app to try and reserve a spot on the ride to skipqueue thing and dont try and use the Magic pass Kiosk  the app kept crash and only let you book in 15 minute slots which filled up pretty quickly and the same with the kiosks   The rides for the magic pass would say close but when we walked up to try and use our ticket the attendant will mark off your ticket let you straight though  winner after mucking around with the app and kiosk for quite some time,1
539,539,4.0,Lotte world is an indoor and outdoor theme park perfect for winter time Before we went here we already put in our mind this theme park was not Disneyland so we didnt expect it to be like Disneyland We bought out tickets from Klook When we bought Klook offered the cheapest price around 27000 krw than any other online ticket We redeemed our tickets in south gate entered the room for group ticketing to redeem the voucher  When we were there it was very cold and all of outdoor rides didnt operated It made indoor rides had a long queued But for kiddies rides the queue was not long enough As for food we preferred to eat at Lottys Garden because of its varieties and price  Rather than the rides we loved the parades most Since the parade area was not big enough almost all children could dance with the characters  Lotte world provides locker rental for coat but we suggest you to bring it along with you just like local people,1
490,490,4.0,This amusement is vertically huge ranges from b3 to 4th floor It can be very confusing when you first reach there Be sure to get a copy of the map at the info counter after you enter located at 1st floor  I entered by the south gate and arrived at the 1st floor playground for young children They cater rides to kids below the height of 100cm and there were variety  If you walk further towards the centre of the theme park on 1st floor you reached the place where the carousel and viking is There are other rides on 1st floor for older kids and adults Most rides height requirement is about 110cm The more thrilling ones probably above 130cm  2nd floor leads to the outdoor theme park where most of the thrill rides are There are also lots of cafes and restaurants on the 2nd floor indoors as well as 2 other adventure rides  3rd floor houses another 3 more adventure rides and 4th floor is where the hot air ballon ride is  Well its really crazily big and we didnt have the time to complete all the rides as we were rushing off to the aquarium Spent a total of 6 hrs there Study the map plan your time wisely and you will be able to get on most rides Magic pass that helps skip queues save time But sometimes the queue for magic pass can also be quite long for popular rides  Comparatively I prefer everland as it is an outdoor theme park and there is a zoo within the park itself Also it is easier to locate the rides in everland,1
356,356,4.0,If one read most if not all of the reviews you will find a few common themes crowded long queue long waiting hours we experienced more or less the same Looking at it at another perspective I find this location a very popular spot for locals especially students and kindergartens No doubt the basic amenities such as toilets are well maintained so they are clean and functional Plenty of food stalls and restaurants spread out so one never runs out of options  There are plenty of articles floating round on the tips so parents do read them otherwise invest in Magic Pass Premium download the Lotte World Adventure Magicpass app to enjoy a few rides with dedicated time slots Of course avoid peak season if you can  Our children 7 and 1 were enjoying themselves nevertheless but the waiting time really did eat up most hours not forgetting time for lunchdinner and breaks The number of ridesattractions are sufficient to keep the kids occupied enough that they can never finish all the rides  The indoor theme park can be like a maze so parents need to read the map carefully while trying to match the ride timing so that one would not miss the parade So its not just an adventure for the kidsteens but also quite another one for the parents,1
479,479,4.0,We went on a Monday and arrived slightly before 10am Stayed right through to 5pm Tips  entrance tickets  for foreign visitors i think its better to purchase the entrance tickets onlinebefore hand  we got our tickets at SGD36 per person adult or child alike redemption is at the south gate  look for the counter that says overseas admission it is not the ticket counter that is outside it is located after the main doors  Magic pass i contemplated purchasing the tickets that comes with magic pass but decided not too and didnt regret my choice  as we arrived fairly early on a monday morning  crowds were thin  didnt have to wait more than 15 mins in the morning  we downloaded the Lotte World App  the app gives u 3 free magic passes per ticketholder  we managed to redeem 2 of the 3 magic passes  Crowd  after 2pm  the crowds started to stream in  and thats when the queue starts to form especially for popular rides like the FLUME ride  so for the popular rides u may wish to redeem your magic pass early we didnt know that and when we tried to redeem our 3rd magic pass in the afternoon for the popular ride  the reservation has closed so please note  overall  my child enjoyed the rides  especially the VR rides and had a fun time  for the price we paid  i thought it was worth it,1
472,472,4.0,There are the indoor and outdoor park I suggest you buy the ticket online eg Klook before your visit as you can get cheaper price and some package promo theme park  aquarium  magic pass etc  Magic passes are very useful to avoid long queue at famous attractions Grab a map from the information counter to make the most out of your visit This place took a long time to explore especially if you plan out on trying out rides  Visited here to try the most adrenaline pumping rides INDOOR The Conquistador French Revolution  with VR option OUTDOOR Gyro Spin Gyro Swing Gyro Drop the Atlantis If you have little kids they will also enjoy merry go round shows and parades and other kidsfriendly attractions The 4D Wild Series indoor is also very fun and can be enjoyed by all  For cultural buff they also have the Folk Museum that is not crowded at all as people prefer the rides where you can see miniatures and artefacts from the many eras of the Korean peninsula  Places to eat are mostly restaurants and some snack stalls  Aquarium is located on separate building,1
470,470,4.0,I dont know why people say the queues are so bad they could hardly ride  We went early in the morning and went on the French Revolution twice without queuing for more than 5 mins bad idea cos one can get really dizzy on that ride  I recommend going for Atlantis for your first ride as that ride is by far the most popular Queue was 40 min or so but if you buy the magic pass from klook you can breeze straight to the front and beat the queue If you wish you can use all your magic passes here prob the best cos the other queues are not as long as this  We bought 5 magic passes We went on every single ride French Revolution 3x Atlantis 3 or 4x gyro spin swing drop a couple of times Conquistador 4x  If you download the app you can get some free magic passes these are timed and released every hour and you could use these for the less popular rides We never managed to use the free app magic passes for the popular ones cos they were always sold out so we gave up  Enjoy yourselves The queues are not that bad But please go early,1
468,468,4.0,This is an ok theme park Appreciated that there is an indoor area when the weather gets too hot or rainy during the summer season Went on a Friday and was quite surprised that the queues were not that long Though the park was quite big I find that there are more things to do at Everland Enjoyed the street and stage performances throughout the day The food choices are ok Would have been better if the park access includes the skating rink area as I believe it costs extra to try out,1
381,381,4.0,Lotte World is a large indoor theme park covering multi stories and including an outdoor area The rides range from kiddie rides through to relatively large roller coasters that older kids will love If youre coming in winter be prepared to layer on and off if youre going to be in or outside  Best to arrive first thing when the crowds are small and queues are short  go to the most popular rides first  Atlantis French Revolution Pharaohs Rage etc otherwise be prepared to queue for up to 2 hours when the crowd builds up especially in the holiday season  The park is clean and well presented and offers a Disneyeque feel complete with their own Snow White Castle  The entry ticket we got 20 off using MasterCard is generally all inclusive a small handful of rides require extra payment There is a range of food from local to western Prices are generally higher than outside  There is a Lotte World app that can book Magic Passes like Disney fast passes but we couldnt get them to work perhaps they need to be booked first thing So suggest some preplanning is essential to get the best out of the park,1
417,417,4.0,Long queues everywhere and it is quite confusing to use their app to book the timeslot for the rides as there are no instructions on how to book for foreigners  Aside from that it is quite interesting and fanciful Theres restaurants and shops inside for you to shop your worth while you are there,1
395,395,4.0,The theme park is not big but it has all the rides and facilities Most rides are for older child with height more than 110cm We spent some time studying the floor maps because the signage was not very clear It was long queue during winter We tried to use the magic pass but some rides did not accept the pass Anyway all of us were having great fun there The parade was not very interesting We were confused about the direction to get there initially because the area was a combination of mall hotel and park No signage to show us how to go to theme park from sunway The exit of the subway is 1 or 2 And the park was located near the food departmental store,1
267,267,4.0,We visited Lotte World during our recent trip to Seoul Great for all ages I like both indoor and outdoor rides Negative points Queueing was 100 minutes for one ride We didnt ride any of the popular rides because the queues were 90 to 110mins per ride This is a whole world of entertainment Outside park inside entertainment food hall and shopping  mall,1
737,737,4.0,Really fun but it was really crowded We went there twice the first time we couldnt handle all the crowd and got out after less than two hours The second time only my sister and I went there and it was still really crowded one game queue take one to one and a half hour at least thirty minutes of waiting Other than the extremely long queues I really enjoyed it Visited in Summer of 2015,1
268,268,4.0,Avoid weekend if possible We went on a Saturday There were just too many people The queue was too long We only managed to catch a few rides Suggest to pay extra to skip the queue,1
392,392,4.0,Went on a Wednesday morning but it was so packed with Korean teenagers many in school uniform It makes me wonder if that was a school excursion or it is a trend to visit theme Parks in school uniforms  We reached there exactly at 930am and when the doors were opened teenagers starting sprinting towards the rides and queues began to form  Not intending to wait too Long for rides we each paid 40000 won for the 5 rides express pass The counter for express pass is located behind the famous Carousel ride A paper band will be tied around your wrist Just show the band to the personnel at the express ride queue and they will mark on the wrist band Choose to use the wrist band wisely Some rides have queues that move quite fast Eg the pirate ship ride which allows 60 riders or more per rid so one should not use the wrist band here The express pass is really useful for rides that have queues up to 1h Long Atlantis and French Revolution have Super Long queues and these are reall high intensity fun rides Use your express pass here Gyro Swing is another ride which has ridiculously Long queue  Dont forget to go to level 23 where there is a photography area with many feature walls to take nice instragammable photos,1
894,894,4.0,the interior design of the indoor themed park is beautiful i love it but for me this is something that the children would really love rather than adults queue is super long too crowded with people,1
885,885,4.0,After reading reviews from tripadvisor we decided to go on a weekday to avoid the crowd Great idea as we could really enjoy games without having to queue Since we didnt have much time we were a bit in a rush to do as much as we could but some attractions are not for every kids depending on the size Our 2 daughters only have 2 years difference but one was below the limit size one was over so for many activities we had to split Not that convenient Overall kids enjoyed it show was pretty lame though and for us it was nice to see them having so much fun,1
873,873,4.0,Went on a Wednesday as part of a group of 6 3 kids 1 young adult 2 oldies The older ones had a had a good day The younger ones had a great day  We arrived at about 1000 and had the place almost to ourselves and managed to complete most of the indoor rides quite quickly no queues  By about 200 it was getting busy After 400 it was very busy and the main rides outside had long queues with wait times up to 60 minutes The indoor rides were still OK though Did several rides twice  Not as big as I expected and as others have said it is fairly expensive but I think it is still well worth a visit  I would suggest going on a weekday and going early Plan your visit maps etc are available online and do the main rides first Maybe do them twice before everybody else gets there  And the staff are hippy happy and very helpful I dont know how anybody can be that cheerful all day Working in a place like this would drive me crazy,1
90,90,4.0, During holidays and holidays there is a lot of queuewaiting for hours But its worth knowing ,1
858,858,4.0,Not the best theme park I visited but it still offers good fun plenty of fun attractions and as always with these kind of theme parks be prepared to queue Overall it was fun I kinda wish I went to everland instead haha The good part though is that the theme park connected to lotte mall which is nice they have lots variety of foods and interesting food and snacks to buy as souvenirs,1
740,740,4.0,This is one of the place you need to visit when you are in Korea it has a lot of rides dedicated to all kind of ages However a great tip to avoid long queues and crowds is to go there when it is not their school holidays or any kinds of holiday,1
101,101,4.0,Nice great decor but long queues,1
897,897,4.0,Lotte world is easily accessible by public transport and do come here early if you want to cover the whole of the theme park There are both indoor and outdoor areas but do be prepared to queue for at least 20 minutes for the more popular rides Its a pretty place too especially when the castle lits up at night Great place for youngsters,1
808,808,4.0,Hi  Lotte world was a last minute decision because we were bored in Seoul after being there for 10 days And I have to say it was a well spent day it is easily accessible by train to jamsil I went on a Monday and the queue was not too long probably a 15mins average waiting time I went from 11am to 6pm and I managed to ride almost all the rides  Heads up first for those who love crazy scary rides this probably will not satisfy you 100 However for those like me who enjoy a moderate level of fear rides this will be an enjoyable trip They do have one roller coaster that was said to be the scariest but I didnt try it so I cant comment However judging by the speed loops I saw and the screams I heard it should be satisfying for any fearseekers  The coolest part about this park was that it was indoors and outdoors I loved the outdoors more cause it had more fun rides there There was a ride I loved so much I went on it for at least 3 times Furthermore they had those cycle sea ducks I always see on korean variety shows that was free  Overall this was one of the better theme parks Ive been Should give it a shot,1
223,223,4.0,It was cheaper to prebook online but was still quite pricey for what it offered There are not many big rides and these had queues of two hours by midday There were more smaller rides and these were quicker to get on with queues of thirty minutes by midday Lots of food choice Toilets were reasonably clean We saw two parades one during the afternoon and one just before closing Both of which were excellent Staff were all cheerful and polite They all spoke some degree of English When paying in the shops you are offered the option of paying in pounds or South Korean Won Check the exchange rate before going as when we went it was cheaper to pay by Won,1
241,241,4.0,we went there during our winter holiday and found out that during winter some of the outdoor rides was closed then we spend half day inside the lotte world but it was too packed most of the rides have around 40 minutes waiting line  but its worth the fun our 6 years old daughter was have some fun on the park  TIPS install the Lotte World Adventure apps on your mobile phone to get more info on the queue line and you also can book the ride as well,1
907,907,4.0,Never miss the extension of it The magic island The only problem is long queues for any adventure The ice rink is amazing Shopping is awesome The rides are breathtaking,1
910,910,4.0,Been there on my recent Summer trip in August Was there from abt 11am 930pm  It was a rather gloomy morning with slight drizzle so it wasnt too crowded  Took the Gyro Drop and Alantis outdoor rollercoaster with a 15min queue Then watch some Kpop highschool musical show and some parade  The crowd started streaming in after lunch hour and queues started to form  Took the French Revolution indoor roller coaster after a 45min queue  then roamed around more took ALL the rides we passed by and left after the Laser Show   these rides are the most worth it if youre into highspeed twist and turns if you scream during a viking ride you should give them a miss lol,1
920,920,4.0,best indoor theme park i have ever been i went there on a friday evening its super crowded almost everything you need to queue for like an hour for outdoor the gyro shot is closed gyro swing nid to queue for 15 hours i din get to play both lazy to queue bu u wont get bored the cherry blossom around lotte world is breathtaking  while queuing for pirate ship we were entertained by the parade which started at 7 afterwards there are still musical show lighting show you just wont get bored plus i get to catch a glimpse of korean star song seung hoon who is filming there ,1
782,782,4.0,Lots to do and the tickets are good value However the queues were simply horrendous Average of 90 minutes to 2 hours for each ride We downloaded the app to book rides according to time slots but there was an online queue too My kid did enjoy it and the balloon rides over the whole park is great for young children,1
921,921,4.0,Brought our 25years old son and he enjoyed very much Especially they have lots of rides suitable for his age However food wise not much variety and expensive which is typical of theme parks Lots of space for him to explore and run around Best to avoid weekends as queue to take a ride takes more than 30mins,1
763,763,4.0,Make sure to go during the offpeak period to avoid long queues for rides We managed to take quite many rides and repeated ones as it was not KR school holidays yet I am surprised with the quality of food was good at Lotte World although slightly pricey but really quite alright Do not pitch it against Disney not quite the same  but good enough It will take you one full day  so make sure you have the time,1
248,248,4.0,My 2 teens asked to visit an amusement park Wanted to visit Everland but was quite a distance Decided to visit some place nearer to our hotel Took a cab there and thought that the driver had sent us to the wrong place as we are not aware that the entrance is at the basement Unlike Disneyland Went in and there was a long queue to purchase the tickets There were many students Luckily the queue proceeded smoothly and fast Bought the tickets to the park and folk museum Did not go to the museum so we wasted on that Spent about 3 hours as there werent many rides that appealed to my teens We bought the so called fastpass in the park so my teens need not queue up The place was alright but not as good as Disneyland Need a bit of refurbishment though,1
956,956,4.0,Its an interesting concept to have an indoor amusement park at this scale it is visually impressive and reasonably clear to navigate The downside is the enormous queues typical to all Asian amusement parks,1

759,759,4.0,LotteWorld has four levels of rides and in addition there is a massive outdoor area which comprises of massive rides I went with a friend and although we couldnt try everything it is definitely something that a young adult could still enjoy I recommend you to prepurchase your ticket at least 2 days as per requirement from online as you could save as much as 35 Need your passport However there is a downside Massive queues And when i say massive i mean average 1hr wait and this was on a Tuesday and not school holiday period If you are willing to spend some more money get the magic pass It allows you to jump queues Also make sure you bought the Allday passport as it allows you to go on any rides,1
749,749,4.0,This is an outdoor amusement park with indoor theme park like Disneyland  The indoor theme park has a few 3D shows which are very exciting not to be missed  The queue for the rides in the outdoor park was quite long and we waited for an average of 45 minutes for the rides  Be prepared to spend a day here as there are many fun things to do here,1
245,245,4.0,Came on a week day but there were loads of people glad we took the tickets with the magic pass and saved a lot of time from queueing overall had a great time,1
342,342,5.0,grabbed margaritas from Vatos urban tacos mallside bar in the underground Lotte world Shopping malls We were margaritad quickly and firmly Regardless we managed to buy the tickets online at the gate a huge saving Sidestep to the one hour of ice skating where my friend ice skated well his first time  I was speed skating in rental skates OMG so much margarita courage hahaha having an amazing time Actually we lost any idea of time but it was running out Made our way to the foreign guest entrance for Lotte world which was challenging yet we made it in We lost things along the way some shopping a power bankhahaha when we finally found the indoor French revolution rollercoaster there was a 70min estimated wait  then an angle appeared out of nowhere and vipd us to the front of a queue with a magic pass It was actual magic Thank goodness  Then an awesome 4D movie adventure Flyventure excellent We did see a lights parade  indoor fireworks during our chaotic cascade through this indoor entertainment shrine All in all we missjudge available time  missed alot but still have and amazing fun tale to tell Really it was very cool very wow  Arriving as late as we did the full price would not have been great value So if your short on time or late or experiencing high times this deal makes it really worthwhile,1
1618,1618,5.0,We arrived at Lotte World just around noon so decided to just eat lunch and walk around the shopping malls before entering the amusement park after 4pm Lotte World amusement park is open all year round until 10pm weekdays or 11pm weekends Thats why even if you go in after 4pm or 7pm you will still have plenty of time to enjoy the amusement rides and attractions  Lotte World amusement park has many fun rides even for the young ones We went on a Friday and did not have to queue long to go on the kiddy rides esp in Level 1 The popular adult rides however were packed with youngsters and I saw some waiting time as long as 2hrs oO There are some very exciting rides like Atlantic Adventure roller coaster Gyro Drop high tower drop ride Flume Ride water plunge ride and Waikiki Wave twisting swingingintheair ride  Throughout the year Lotte World celebrates different festival and when we went they were celebrating Halloween so there were many decorations picture booths performances and characters dressed in Halloween costumes By the way I think 2 rides you shouldnt miss out on are the World Monorail which goes around the entire amusement park indoors and outdoors and the Aeronauts Balloon Ride indoors Both rides give you the most beautiful scenic sky view of Lotte World  More posts on our Korean trip here httpwwwsakuraharukacomsearchlabelkorea,1

283,283,5.0,My 6yearold daughter and I visited Lotte World twice during our recent trip to Seoul I must say at first i was worried the language barrier might spoil the fun but it turned out to be no problem at all Every ride has clear bilingual instructions on height and safety rules plus all the staff can communicate in basic english  There are plenty of rides to suite all ages but the outdoor rides in Magic Island are mostly for older kids over 130 or 140cm tall  I would suggest you purchase the Magic Pass for Express entrance if you wanna avoid long queues especially on weekends and holidays  Yeah so definitely recommend Lotte World if you like theme parks My child says its more fun than Universal Studios and Legoland,1

1028,1028,5.0,Visited one weekday in December but I guess it was school holidays it was so so crowded The kids went crazy at this place lots of kids ride and the queue was long for each activity We spent one full day here We did not play the outdoor activities as it was freezing cold Hope to pay this place a visit soon,1
886,886,5.0,Its a MUSTDO in Seoul especially if you havent been exposed to the amusement parks Not crazy fun like SixMountains but you dont have to pay 80 for a day either You pay 6070 for Disneyland HK and Tokyo but I paid only 20 there were plenty of deals to cut the ticket price cut to the half Its not definitely like dreamland Disneyland or Universal Studios or extreme ultimatim SixFlags but I made sure to visit off peak hours so that I didnt need to queue for a while The portfolio or rides and equipments were very well balanced from family to epichigh stuff and the mixture of indoor and outdoor Food inside is quite good but pricey as any other amusement parks There are gourmet restaurants outside the park so make sure to come out and enjoy the food and shopping The parade  circus show are something kids love about Id visit again Make sure to avoid weekend or summer time when youngsters come any time and cause a long queue,1
859,859,5.0,The place looks awesome  fantastic for wide eyed kids and kids at heart like me  The kiddie rides are fast queueing The other adult type rides of course have long lines and a waste of stay time  The lunch queueing is worse Aladdin should add more cashiers when the lunch surge kicks in The LONE CASHIER is simply overwhelmed by the volume of people  In all if rides are all that matter then this is the best place If youre planning on getting the lunch ticket I suggest you dont Bring your own food or just get some from the other hotdog cencessionaires,1
1108,1108,5.0,Not as big scale as compared to everland but filled with a lot of fun activities The queue was quite terrible when I went there on a monday Located in the city and thus very accessible for tourists planning to travel seoul only Bonus lotte mart and departmental store are just right outside and you may want to buy things there after spending a day in lotte world,1
1111,1111,5.0,A lot of rides for the children There is an indoor park and an outdoor park The outdoor park looks fun with exciting rides but we didnt manage to take rides as it was raining  However there was plenty to do indoors The rides are based according to heights We went during off peak so the queues were not too long There is also an evening  It is easy to go there using public transport just that you need to walk to bit from the subway to the Lotte World,1
856,856,5.0,I went here when it was like 2012 then the day after all the Kpop idols had some Pepero thing there T T It was a really nice experience but you have to be really patient with the queues though But I managed to sit through all of themAnd Im the most impatient person you can find But its worth it I recommend getting all the fast passes or something I forgot what its called so meanwhile you can go play other things that doesnt have long queues after you get the pass D y,1
1142,1142,5.0,I am 7 years old and it was a fun time there And I get to go on every rollercoaster except the one outside I was too small for it Vr rollercoaster was the best The queues were very very Long but not as Long as some places like universal studios in Singapore The indoor part was the best coz it was cool not hot and we went early so going on rides was easy The tomb of horror was horrible I was so scared my daddy had to carry me just like a little baby Now Im done,1
795,795,5.0,Best for kids below 7 If you only have time for one theme park and have young kids go for this There is a kids section indoor that catered to this age group They definitely enjoyed and remembered this theme park more than Everland  Liked that they have a cheaper admission ticket only that caters to adults who accompanied kids but not interested in the rides  Suprisinglh popular among koreans and was wuite crowded with teenages and children from school tours on a weekday Come early to avoid queues,1
792,792,5.0,Spent the whole day here as kids Within Lotte World the rides are suited to kids with rollercoasters water rides ice skating rink etc There are small shops of souvenirs and food stalls situated in areas next to every ride but honestly theyre in every corner Outside is Magic Island where the rides are just a tad more extreme nonetheless still suited for younger kids Rides such as French Revolution  a large rollercoaster inside Lotte World hot air balloon and Phantoms Fury have huge queues so start with those first,1
1161,1161,5.0,Lotte world is huge I went on a Friday and spent an entire day there Despite it being a weekday the place was super crowded On average I think I spent about 1 and a half hour queuing for each ride The queues can be quite painful but the rides were well worth the queue I would suggest reaching Lotte World the moment it opens and going straight for the few rides you really want to go for first Because the waiting times for some of the more exciting rides become 2 and a half hours later in the afternoon There are many restaurants in the theme park too and they are surprisingly not expensive Also weather is not really an issue since most of the rides are indoors Overall I had a great day there But it was really tiring to queue though,1
745,745,5.0,This is amazing place I absolutely love it Id definitely go there again If you love carousels slides and different entertainment youll love it here But be ready for long queues I spent more time waiting in line than riding The staff are friendly but English is a problem for the local population And in case its not cheap Plus you probably will spend some money for ice cream or a sandwich all this and more you can buy there easily Just be sure you have enough money,1
736,736,5.0,This theme park was SOOO much fun Its so worth the trip There is an indoor Adventure World and the outdoor Magic Island  be sure to get the correct ticket if youre planning to visit both There are lockers to leave your belongings  just remember to bring your ticket with you because they do check it at the rides  We went on a weekday afternoon so it wasnt THAT crowded Be sure to get a map so you can navigate the rides that youre interested in We decided to just pick the thrill rides because we only had a few hours till closing The queues were an average of 3045 mins but the waits are VERY worth it The thrill rides are super fun we even queued twice for The Atlantis Magic Island  Theres loads of FB options and restrooms were conveniently located and very clean We stayed till closing and at about 8pm they have a float parade at the main atrium of Adventure world which is beautiful to watch We really felt our inner children come alive when we were there Im definitely going back on my next visit,1

1472,1472,5.0,This place is so amazing As we are on a school trip we had a tour of the place and after that we had a presentation After presentation we had lunch and we were free to enjoy the whole place Amazingly theres indoor and outdoor theme park Due to our schedule we had only 4hours to explore the whole place Some rides are really just for kids u have to choose the right rides Indoor theres like mirror world roller coaster and ice skating ring Outdoor theres the bigger rides like gyro swing and gyro drop As with other theme park there were many people queuing up For indoors ride some have this machine where u can get your queue number which theres time on it u just have to go on that time to get into the ride straight away instead of waiting Super experience overall will go back again youtube  lolsia2000 for videos when im at there,1
681,681,5.0,What makes Lotte world different from many other theme parks is that it has quite a huge airconditioned what a great plus for summer season indoor theme park section There are many levels of different rides and simply exploring the place makes an interesting experience  I like that rides are of varying thrill levels making it suitable for kids as well as thrillseekers I would definitely recommend it for families even with young children as they have a huge kiddy play section  I went on a weekday and hardly queued for more than 10 min per ride and I took about 14 rides in total Only had to queue 30 min for 1 or 2 rides I was also lucky to find discounted tickets online for foreigners and ended up paying 29000 instead of 52000 won You can google it and purchase them in advance but remember to bring your passport there,1
663,663,5.0,Its our second time visiting the park There are much more people then before prepare to queue up for some of the popular rides Quite a lot of rides are closed for maintenance when we visited which is quite frustrating The indoor part is amazing and very good for our visit as there was lots of rain Occasionally there are singers performance at the indoor stage Overall a not bad choice for families to spend half day or so,1
638,638,5.0,Super big theme park both indoors and outdoors Indoor games closes till 10pm Have a few scary rides indoors especially the French revolution where the queue was as long as 90mins at around 6pm  Please purchase tix from funtastickorea funko for short Costs 29000Krw I think cant remember but it was 45 discount Pay online and they will email you the tickets which you show to the counter to exchange for actual tickets  We went on a Saturday so it was filled with locals Managed to try almost all the games but we left the place at 11pm We started at 11am though,1
618,618,5.0,A lot of rides for the children There is an indoor park and an outdoor park The outdoor park looks fun with exciting rides but we didnt manage to take rides as it was raining  However there was plenty to do indoors The rides are based according to heights We went during off peak so the queues were not too long There is also an evening  It is easy to go there using public transport just that you need to walk to bit from the subway to the Lotte World,1

612,612,5.0,Visited with my daughters on 24th September a Sunday We make good use of the 20 coupon at the back of Seoul Map available to tourist upon arrival at Incheon Airport Outdoor rides are limited compared to Indoor rides Please try to avoid weekends and holidays for the long long queue that takes 23hrs just for a ride which is really frustrating Overall it is a very good amusement park to spend a day exploring with the family which we enjoyed and will definitely look forward to returning again on a week day,1
597,597,5.0,We brought 2 kids age 4 and 6 to Lotte World theme park and they had whale of a time Although my younger girl cant take most rides shorter than 110cm she thoroughly enjoy the 230pm and 830pm parade and the magic show at Fairy Theatre  We were there 1130am  9pm and honestly only manage to cover the whole indoor adventure park but for outdoor barely cover 20 Will highly recommend families to stay whole day If you wish to visit the Lotte Aquarium or Pororo Park please arrange separately as the 1 Day pass for your to enter Lotte World theme park when you exit cannot reenter  I had gone to Pororo Park on 2 other days 2 hours this is the limit for the ticket entry price on each day The small playground with slide rooms with Lego blocks and building blocks Pororo  Friends performance the big bouncing castle carousel only open for small intervals on weekday ferries Wheel and bumper car are all really fun for both my kids Although it is more crowded on weekend the rides are all more frequent hence dont really need to queue much Personally think my kids had more fun on weekend as they manage to catch more rides during the 2 hours compared to a weekday And parents with preschoolers trust me although it is only 2 hours it is enough to exhaust them that the kids will sleep early that day,1
1278,1278,5.0,We went on a very busy day there were long queues but the rides were great especially the gyro drop Indoor and outdoor theme park with an ice rink and lots of food outlets,1
1351,1351,5.0,Lotte world is one of my favorite attractions in Korea I would highly recommend this place if you want to make some great memories Its a place for both children and adults Try to reach lotte world as early as possible in the morning around its opening time It would be less crowded then Keep the information guide map handy all the time It will help you a lot covering attractions more efficiently As soon as we reached lotte world we rushed to the roller coaster French Revolution which is on the 2nd floor In the morning time the waiting queue is small So if you want to avoid long queues I would suggest you to grab the opportunity asap I simply loved this indoor roller coaster ride It was thrilling as well as super fun Next we made a clever strategy and decided to cover the attractions in top to down fashion starting from the 4th floor all the way down to the underland B1 floor I think that helped a bit avoiding long queues and we could cover our desired attractions quickly Dont forget to visit the Wild 4D shows wind valley and jungle in underland B1 floor Its a super amazing experience The best among the all was wild wind And you can skip the other two After covering all the floors we next moved on to the Magic land which is outdoor It also has many thrilling outdoor rides My favorite of all is Atlantis roller coaster DO NOT miss this ride if you want to experience a real thrill Waiting queue is too long but its worth the wait My next favorite in the magic land was comet express with rolling chairs I came out laughing and it was pretty amazing I truly dont feel that one day is enough to cover all the attractions in lotte world As per the meals are concerned we carried our own homemade food for lunch There are also many and a great variety of restaurants out there For vegetarians like me there is a restaurant named Lake Pizza in the magic land which serves New York style pizza and its super yummy Do plan a full day tour and avoid rainy days and weekends if possible Also avoid going in winter season as many outdoor rides are closed Dont waste too much time clicking photographs as you might miss some super fun rides out there Trust me one day is just not enough Good luck and have fun ,1
533,533,5.0,Visited Lotte world with my 11 year old pre teen Booked tickets on KLOOK  got the one with 5 premium magic passes each Did not regret it one bit These magic passes are used like the Disneyland fast passes simply present the passes indicated on the ticket and struck off once used for a ride  enter a separate queue for magic pass and board the ride It was challenging trying to obtain magic passes using the app  the entrance ticket itself includes 3 magic passes  but these are subject to availability We did not bother obtaining any after failing in the first hour  To avoid the crowd we purposely visited on a Monday Got in at 930 once the park opened Finished the thrill rides by 1130 with merely 510 min queues each By noon the lines were snaking around But it didnt look too bad  wait time was 1530 min max We opted to use our premium magic passes for repeat rides which my daughter really enjoyed The park was most crowded from mid afternoon onwards Our favorites were the Atlantis and gyro swing We are adrenaline junkies Unfortunately the gyro drop and French Revolution were closed for maintenance  For the price paid it was a fun day out Very value for money Do not forget to explore the underland  these were the bulk of the VR rides so avoid if prone to get motion sickness or giddy  Food was decently priced not exorbitant for a theme park A large drink and popcorn chicken went for 6000won Please do yourself a favor and rent a locker  1000won only  per use  cant open repeatedly,1
508,508,5.0,Tips Book in advanced Get a Magic Pass to skip the long queue you still need to fall in line though but magic pass holders are kind of priority Be there early Some of the rides close early the Magic pass lane Download their app so you can plan what time and which ride you want to do first  Wear your most comfortable shoes  The best rides for me though French Revolution Atlantis Pharoahs fury Gyro drop  Bungee drop  If we have more time and magic pass Id still want to try sinbad log fume carousel etc as they have good reviews But we only have 5 pass and were too tired lol,1
488,488,5.0,We came here late Thursday morning and there was almost no queue at all the rides Think the crowd came in about 2pm or so however queue length is still relatively ok at 3040mins  Generally the indoor parts are for kids and outdoor rides are more older kids or adults  We bought our tickets from the internet and managed to cut the ticket queue however we still need to exchange for real tickets at the South Gate and only there Signage was quite bad and it took us about 1520 mins to locate it  Within the theme park again signage can be improved as we find ourselves circling around look for the specific rides  All in all it was still fun enough for us to go around without lunch for 8 hours  Cannot be compared to Disney or universal studios but good enough for us,1
1395,1395,5.0,For those who have been to the Mall of America in Minnesota this is just like that except it doesnt have the outdoor feeling There is a lot to do at this indoor theme park We went on a weekday so it wasnt too crowded but had to queue 20 min tiger the tickets My kids had a lot of fun and in 3 hours we went on about 6 rides I didnt like all the bright lights though The excessive use of lighting is one thing about Seoul which I didnt like It is worse than Tokyo We got very tired and withdrawn mostly because of the lighting and because it was indoors Still a great day out on a rainy day,1
440,440,5.0,Visited one weekday in December but I guess it was school holidays it was so so crowded The kids went crazy at this place lots of kids ride and the queue was long for each activity We spent one full day here We did not play the outdoor activities as it was freezing cold Hope to pay this place a visit soon,1
674,674,5.0,I am 7 years old and it was a fun time there And I get to go on every rollercoaster except the one outside I was too small for it Vr rollercoaster was the best The queues were very very Long but not as Long as some places like universal studios in Singapore The indoor part was the best coz it was cool not hot and we went early so going on rides was easy The tomb of horror was horrible I was so scared my daddy had to carry me just like a little baby Now Im done,1
840,840,5.0,Whatever the weather is cold or hot outside you can have a great time in the indoor part The food provided inside is good with reasonable price The attractions are great but some may need to queue up for a long time especially those thrill ride in indoor or outdoor The magic pass is good but you need to arrive early to get those it from the hot attractions ie the thrill roller coaster indoor and outdoor Highly recommended for family,1
