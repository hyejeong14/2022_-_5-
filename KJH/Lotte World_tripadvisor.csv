0,Learntorock,4.0,"It was cheaper to pre-book on-line, but was still quite pricey for what it offered. There are not many big rides and these had queues of two hours by midday. There were more smaller rides and these were quicker to get on with queues of thirty minutes by midday. Lots of food choice. Toilets were reasonably clean. We saw two parades, one during the afternoon and one just before closing. Both of which were excellent. Staff were all cheerful and polite. They all spoke some degree of English. When paying in the shops you are offered the option of paying in pounds or South Korean Won. Check the exchange rate before going as when we went it was cheaper to pay by Won.","Written July 16, 2022"
1,lostinatlanta,4.0,"If you have younger kids this place is great. Plan to spend the whole day there as there is lots of stuff to do with younger kids. If you have teenagers, then it will be a shorter trip since rides are more geared toward younger folks, think magic kingdom at Disney. Food is surprisingly reasonably prices and this place is very clean.  The only negative is that if you don't speak / read Korean, buying tickets and getting in can get a bit confusing but there are staff there that can help. It is very convenient to get to, since it is located at a major subway stop attached to a very nice and large mall.","Written July 13, 2022"

Basically, the only fun ride was the Atlantis roller coaster and nothing else is that good. Plus, the place was packed with local students and I had to queue for 3 hours just for the Atlantis ride and trust me it wasn't pleasant at all. By the time we completed the ride, it was already evening. I would say they're trying to emulate disneyland with the castle and stuffs but boy was i wrong, as it wasn't even a ""fun"" experience at all.

I have been to many amusement parks, and I would not say that this has the best rides but I would say that it was a really fun environment and a fun place for kids and for friends just walking around and going on rides. They do have some really awesome rides for adults, but I don't think the adults will be doing the hair and dress up to be a princess for the day. Especially when all the dresses are kids sizes. They have parades and showtimes which are great. Right now they still have the Halloween decorations up in the Halloween shows going on and I have to say they did an amazing job. The lines for the rides are pretty long on the weekends especially after 4 pm. Be aware that tickets have a discounted price after 4, which means a lot more people are there. So there is a pretty big crowd for the Halloween show in Magic Island. Make sure you hold your kids hands or you will lose them.

I was so excited before for this theme park as it kept appearing in Korean variety shows, but it is SO FAR OFF from my expectations now the only emotion i have left for it is pure disgust.  This park is a completely waste of time - the rides are old, trashy and not very well maintained. We waited 120mins to go on a ride called ‚ÄòFrench Revolution‚Äô but in return all we got was a massive headache from our heads banging on the seats, and spent 15mins recovering from that.  A limited options of food and the taste is also not that great. The castle is extremely small, and here comes the worst attraction in the park - Ghost House. This attraction is such a joke, still left us traumatised. We waited an hour in line (when we still had hope for the park) for this horrendous attraction, and I felt my head was filled with crap after sitting down and basically watched a badly animated short-film when the protagonist - the cat, realised that he is not a real cat, but a ghost cat. Hence, even though we got there at approx 11am, we left at 4ish because we felt like we were ruining our mood by keep staying in the park despite the fact that we didn‚Äôt want to waste our money.  And lastly, if you‚Äôve been to Disneyland or Universal studios theme parks and you‚Äôre used to their standards, don‚Äôt waste your time and money at Lotte World. Seriously.

So upon entering the park, we try to get on some of the big rides: - French Revolution: Closed for 'Inspections' - Drop tower: Closed for 'Inspections' - Gyro drop: Just closed - Comet coaster: Reservations only, and rude staff - Atlantis coaster: Huge queue, but at the back of it 'Closed', and rude staff  Some of the other smaller rides inside were pleasant enough, and the park is themed beautifully, just a shame that they decided to charge full price when all their major rides were innaccessible.  Also, anytime we tried to spend money (including buying the tickets) with our GBP credit cards in the park, we were forced to use their scammy currency conversion and end up paying a huge fee.

There were lots of rides for all thrill levels both indoors and outdoors. Atlantis, Gyro Drop, and French Revolution, were some of the more thrilling rides I remember riding. Definitely worth using the pass for. If you visiting with young kids I did see there were some rides that were only for young kids. The park really caters to all ages.  For the Instagram mets there was also an area inside near the VR attractions for taking selfies. The selfie studio is set up with sets and props as well as tripods for rent. We loved taking pictures with the various backdrops.  We happened to be there for Halloween, so there was also costume rentals and face painting (extra costs) near the entrance. There was even a haunted house set up. Not to forget the Halloween parade. We saw that they even has some of the park guests who were dressed as princesses participate.  Lots of food affordable food available as well. Food stalls as well as set restaurants and food courts were available all over the park. There seems to have been no issues about bringing your own too. We brought in our own water.

63,Celine T,4.0,"We decided to go to this park on a whim. Lotte world is the biggest indoor theme park (in the world?). It is at the edge of the lotte department store at Jamsil station. If you buy an online ticket you need to walk all the way around the park to the southern gate and then enter that side. It doesnt matter where you leave your bags as the lockers are accessible from several exits of the park.  The park extends outdoors and there are some events centred around halloween. Specifically the indoor haunted house is not very scary but the outdoor house with entry fee of 5000 won is very scary. 5/5 spooks. Rules involved. Don't let go of the rope, no running, don't blind the actors. The wait times in the park are so mixed and with a ticket you only get to reserve 3 rides. I didnt really like this system as some rides are reservation only and can run out very fast. I recommend you book asap for a ride that looks interesting as we missed out on both of the massive indoor roller coasters operating that day. Furthermore the outdoor 3 biggest coasters were all closed for maintenance. A wait time under 30 minutes is tolerable and not worth wasting a magic pass on. The staff were also mind enough to let my friend and I into the same ride even though she was in the reserved session after mine.  My other big complaint is that staff are very unprofessional and let their friends into rides ahead of the queue. There was a halloween show that started 6pm and two friends went in to chat with their mate despite the sign saying it is dangerous for individuals. It also seems impossible to access the ice skating rink without leaving the park.

68,banglee,4.0,"We went in at 10 a.m. which was the opening time but there was already a long queue in front of entrance. Soooo many students since it was summer holidays.  We knew what we wanted to go for so ran to French revolution as soon as we entered. One of the most popular rides. We rode within 10 mins and went on to next one, Pirates ship, managed to ride within 15 mins.  We tactfully chose the rides with shorter queue and could ride many rides for the first few hours. It was possible because I am very familiar with rides and how to go about. If you are to come in in the afternoon, I strongly suggest 2 ways to shorten your queue time.  I am not talking about buying ridiculously expensive fast passes. Something you can do for free.  Lotte world uniquely offer 3 fast access using their own App. Magic pass App. Of course you will want to have more than 3 passes since there are many popular ones but better than nothing.  You first need to scan or manually register your entrance tickets on App. Press reserve ride. Each ride opens up every 15 mins to choose time slot. Within seconds, slots will be gone. It is difficult to explain here. Once you try to use App, you will get the hang of it soon.  If you are not very technical person or have slow finger, I would suggest another way. Know what you want to ride and go there. At each entrance of ride, you will see ticket reservation machine. Simply scan your ticket then it will give out next available time slot. Bring that paper at given time and go to fast pass way.  Only downside of this method is you need to physically go to ride and scan your tickets. If your 3 rides are all scattered around, you need to walk around so much. I suggest you to choose 3 rides relatively close to each other.  Atlantis, French revolution, pirates ship and gyro drop are the must-trys. There were 3 horror houses but I didn't try since my 2 kids were too scared to go in. The most popular one was at magic island which is outdoor. It's a shame that you need to pay 5000 won to go in.  There are many variety of restaurants to choose from. Korean, Japanese, Chinese and burgers...etc. Many stalls sell Lottel world goods and desserts.  Lotte world rides can entertain from toddlers to teenagers. They have more indoor rides than outdoor ones. Perfect for rainy days. We stayed until 4 p.m. and rode most of the rides using App and reservation machines. Without a plan, you could wait for hours for each ride so plan well ahead.","Written September 10, 2019"

70,KKgirl93,4.0,"Spent my birthday at Lotte World Adventure and I must say that this place exceeded my expectations. I was concerned that it would be more suitable for young children and whilst there are really a lot of rides and attractions catered towards a children and a younger audience, there were plenty of things for adults to entertain themselves with with as well.  Unfortunately, we went on a super wet and rainy day and could not try all the rides on the Magic Island (what they call the outdoor area) because they all closed once it started pouring. Thankfully there is a relatively large and pleasant indoor area but we had to queue for ages for the indoor rides.  My advice before going to Lotte World is to plan your visit well. Decide which rides or attractions you want to visit, and consider if its worth investing in the Magic Passes. We spent most of our day queueing and it can get quite frustrating to stand in lines for 50-60 minutes at a time. The Magic Passes would save time for sure but if I'm not mistaken, you still need to ""fight"" for certain ride slots. Do check that you aren't going on a public or school holiday in S. Korea and do avoid weekends. We went on a random Thursday - to our knowledge there were no holidays, but still the place was packed with school children and teenagers.  Another tip - don't miss the Folk Museum! It was actually a really impressive museum and we enjoyed exploring the exhibits.","Written September 6, 2019"

The indoor part is also huge with so many rides and activities. Lots of food outlets. Never out of choices. A day is not enough. One tip is never buy ticket on site.

Negative points:- *please check your children‚Äôs height before going. We do not have particularly small Children (6+9) but we found out they couldn‚Äôt ride the majority of the rides. My 6 year old was even too short for the swings! I don‚Äôt know if it was H&S but the sizes were strange. We could only go around the video rides, amusement arcades and a few of the street games. It looks like a magical place but we felt very flat. It feels like a cheaper version of Disney, even down to the red bow. It looses something with all the similarities, there are so many. I would have loved it to be more Korean. Street procession was like a Brazil carnival.  Queueing was 100 minutes for one ride and it was a very humid/rainy day which makes me think on a nicer day it could be worse.  One thing is guaranteed, this place will have you haemorrhaging money. We paid W198,000.00 (family of 4)and that was without the added extras like museum entrance. There are also things like ‚ÄúThe Mirror Maze‚Äù, darts games and other attractions that will cost you extra, you can buy additional tickets next to the rides for these. It‚Äôs a very costly day.  We were left disappointed but that was due to the lack of availability for rides for a 6&9 year old, who have visited many parks and ridden the same rides in other areas.

100,Anne Ying,1.0,"We went on a Friday after Memorial day holiday in Seoul. May have been the most stupid time to go other than memorial day itself.  I paid for 3 tickets on Kloop (ticket collection was far away from the main entrance... A good 10-15min walk after asking 3 different people) and added 5 magic passes to two of those tickets for an extra S$100. What a waste of money. The magic pass system is terrible. Every 15 minutes the system opens to allow time slots to be booked to reserve the ride and skip the queue. It has very limited number of time slots each hour and try as we might, for 2 hours we could not reserve anything. Each time the reservation started... It showed all slots filled/closed about 10 seconds after it opened. Eventually all time slots had been reserved and we had to queue with everyone else. So that was $100 down the drain. We didn't ride any of the popular rides because the queues were 90 to 110mins per ride. We were there for 10 hours (until closing time) and rode 5 rides all day. We thought... Screw it let's pay extra to play the VR games.... But no... There's a height restriction and my girl was 5cm below it.  Also, the stupid parade that they run through the main indoor Adventure land around 2pm will section off large areas which cannot be crossed easily or at all (during some parts of the parade). So don't get separated or you won't be able to return until after the parade ends. And all this online advice about going for the popular rides during the parade I found to be bull crap.... The queues were long and getting longer still...  While my 10yr old enjoyed it, as an adult - I wouldn't wish the experience on my worst enemy. Only a parents love for his kids got me through this day.  Just be prepared to queue. Bring your tunes and your headphones, battery pack for your phones, a portable fan (sweaty queues whether indoor or out), snacks, drinks, and pack light. There are plenty of lockers but they are single use so if you do use them then make sure you keep the important stuff with you. One thing I wish I had was a collapsible stool. You will stand for a long long time at Lotte World in queue after queue. I saw some parent bring a picnic mat for the kids to sit and lie on. She was a local with local knowledge.

Buy your ticket on trazy.com. there's a special promo exclusive for foreigners which gives you an option to purchase the admission ticket at 16% off + 3 Magic Pass rides + free sausage + 1 free VR attraction for just an extra $20. It is definitely worth it. There is also an option for 5 Magic Pass rides. 3. Download the Lotte World app so you can check queue times and decide which ride to best use your magic pass on. There's an option to reserve on the app but those are usually gone in minutes so it's best to visit the magic pass kiosk in the 1st flr and B1 (location is in the map). Pls note that you have to use your 1st magic pass first before you can make another kiosk reservation. 4. On top of the 3 magic passes, you can use your ticket as a magic pass 3 more times.

We lost things along the way some shopping a power bank....hahaha when we finally found the indoor French revolution rollercoaster there was a 70min estimated wait !

Looking at it at another perspective, I find this location a very popular spot for locals especially students and kindergartens. No doubt the basic amenities such as toilets are well maintained, so they are clean and functional. Plenty of food stalls and restaurants spread out so one never runs out of options.  There are plenty of articles floating round on the tips so parents do read them, otherwise invest in Magic Pass Premium, download the Lotte World Adventure Magicpass app to enjoy a few rides with dedicated time slots. Of course, avoid peak season if you can!  Our children (7 and 1+) were enjoying themselves nevertheless, but the waiting time really did eat up most hours, not forgetting time for lunch/dinner and breaks. The number of rides/attractions are sufficient to keep the kids occupied enough that they can never finish all the rides.  The indoor theme park can be like a maze so parents need to read the map carefully while trying to match the ride timing so that one would not miss the parade.

Some experiences you have to pay extra for and you don't know this unless you go up to it like the VR experience on B3. They had a tour pamphlet all in Korean with the ice rink in it and we thought it was part of Lotte World. The park staff on B3, with very poor English, so I think she said, we'll be exiting the park and reentry is not permitted. So to sum up.

The park is clean and well presented and offers a Disney-eque feel complete with their own Snow White Castle.  The entry ticket (we got 20% off using MasterCard) is generally all inclusive (a small handful of rides require extra payment). There is a range of food from local to western. Prices are generally higher than outside.

Not intending to wait too Long for rides, we each paid 40000 won for the 5 rides express pass. The counter for express pass is located behind the famous Carousel ride. A paper band will be tied around your wrist. Just show the band to the personnel at the express ride queue and they will mark on the wrist band. Choose to use the wrist band wisely. Some rides have queues that move quite fast. Eg the pirate ship ride which allows 60 riders or more per rid, so one should not use the wrist band here.

Lotte World has a rather dated feel and look - it was probably the bees knees twenty or thirty years ago, but doesn't seem to have moved with the times. The staff during my stay were impeccable - polite and efficient, if rather lacking in warmth. My double room was comfortable, functional, and equipped with the sort of items that one needs and expects in a hotel of this level, but faded. The wallpaper and carpet looked as though they should have been changed years ago, and the shower over the bath tub was a Heath-Robinson arrangement. The corridor carpets were equally in need of changing, and the space was pervaded by a musty smell, that may be a legacy of the days when smoking was common in the corridors and rooms. I didn't think much of the dining options: a Chinese place on a high floor (which I didn't try) and a buffet place on the second floor (which I did). The hotel lacks a simple coffee shop type restaurant where one can order a simple dish from a menu. There are plenty of better hotel options in Seoul.","Written September 4, 2018"

Queue was 40 min or so but if you buy the magic pass from klook you can breeze straight to the front and beat the queue. If you wish, you can use all your magic passes here (prob the best cos the other queues are not as long as this)  We bought 5 magic passes. We went on every single ride, French Revolution 3x, Atlantis 3 or 4x, gyro spin, swing, drop a couple of times, Conquistador 4x.  If you download the app you can get some free magic passes (these are timed and released every hour) and you could use these for the less popular rides.

249,Grace O,4.0,"There are the indoor and outdoor park. I suggest you buy the ticket online (e.g. Klook) before your visit as you can get cheaper price and some package promo (theme park + aquarium + magic pass, etc).  Magic passes are very useful to avoid long queue at famous attractions. Grab a map from the information counter to make the most out of your visit. This place took a long time to explore especially if you plan out on trying out rides.  Visited here to try the most adrenaline pumping rides (INDOOR: The Conquistador, French Revolution - with VR option, OUTDOOR: Gyro Spin, Gyro Swing, Gyro Drop, the Atlantis). If you have little kids, they will also enjoy merry go round, shows and parades, and other kids-friendly attractions. The 4D Wild Series (indoor) is also very fun and can be enjoyed by all.  For cultural buff, they also have the Folk Museum that is not crowded at all (as people prefer the rides) where you can see miniatures and artefacts from the many eras of the Korean peninsula.  Places to eat are mostly restaurants and some snack stalls.  Aquarium is located on separate building.","Written July 2, 2018"

It looks very safe and well maintained.  Negative: When I pay an entrance fee of 50 USD I don't understand why some of the very simple attractions require an extra payment. I found this very disappointing and a little fraudulent.  If your staff is sad and depressed as they look, please don't let them wave always their hands.

253,Sisca,3.0,"Before I went there, I've read not so good review about this park. Some attraction you have to pay, some are only for toddlers, some are under maintenance. Because it's indoor, I think they have to do the landscape in certain way. This makes the route pretty confusing and lots of stairs (even though there are escalators in main area). The employee looks not so enthusiastic (though not impolite / rude), and not efficient in managing the crowd, which is surprising because Korean are normally quite fast in working. Me and my 2 children normally loves theme park, but this one I give Rating 3 simply because it's indoor, so it's the weather is not hot. There are attraction outside and it's very hot.

Magic pass i contemplated purchasing the tickets that comes with magic pass but decided not too and didn't regret my choice. - as we arrived fairly early on a monday morning - crowds were thin - didn't have to wait more than 15 mins in the morning. - we downloaded the Lotte World App - the app gives u 3 free magic passes per ticketholder! - we managed to redeem 2 of the 3 magic passes  Crowd - after 2pm - the crowds started to stream in - and that's when the queue starts to form especially for popular rides like the FLUME ride. - so for the popular rides, u may wish to redeem your magic pass early. we didn't know that and when we tried to redeem our 3rd magic pass in the afternoon for the popular ride -- the reservation has closed. so please note!  overall - my child enjoyed the rides - especially the VR rides and had a fun time - for the price we paid - i thought it was worth it!","Written June 24, 2018"

It's confusing place as they do not provide the map at the outdoor entrance. We had to figured out on our own at the end of the day we found the entrance from the mall and the map was there, plus no information to inform the tourist if they were busy with a big tour group.

We bought our tickets from the internet and managed to cut the ticket queue, however we still need to exchange for real tickets at the South Gate, and only there. Signage was quite bad and it took us about 15-20 mins to locate it.  Within the theme park, again signage can be improved as we find ourselves circling around look for the specific rides.

If you rarely go to large theme parks, then you'll like lotte world. I really didnt like lotte world because it was so tiny that I could cover the entire amusement park in under 4 hours. I don't know about other countries, but in America, disneyland is so huge that it takes a whole day just to cover one section of the park. Compared to the disneyland in LA, lotte world is like 1/10 the size. It's just so tiny and the rides were not really ""thrilling"" at all. The horror house was literally a 10 minute 3D video for 5 year olds. If you have young kids, then lotte world wouldn't be a bad choice, but if you're over 15 years old, I suggest everland over lotte world.","Written June 13, 2018"
267,Veron C,4.0,"This amusement is vertically huge, ranges from b3 to 4th floor. It can be very confusing when you first reach there. Be sure to get a copy of the map at the info counter after you enter located at 1st floor.  I entered by the south gate and arrived at the 1st floor playground for young children. They cater rides to kids below the height of 100cm and there were variety.  If you walk further towards the centre of the theme park on 1st floor, you reached the place where the carousel and viking is. There are other rides on 1st floor for older kids and adults. Most rides height requirement is about 110cm. The more thrilling ones probably above 130cm.  2nd floor leads to the outdoor theme park where most of the thrill rides are. There are also lots of cafes and restaurants on the 2nd floor indoors as well as 2 other adventure rides.  3rd floor houses another 3 more adventure rides and 4th floor is where the hot air ballon ride is.  Well it‚Äôs really crazily big and we didn‚Äôt have the time to complete all the rides as we were rushing off to the aquarium. Spent a total of 6 hrs there. Study the map, plan your time wisely and you will be able to get on most rides. Magic pass that helps skip queues save time. But sometimes the queue for magic pass can also be quite long for popular rides.  Comparatively, I prefer everland as it is an outdoor theme park and there is a zoo within the park itself. Also it is easier to locate the rides in everland.","Written June 13, 2018"

There is limited space in the fishes in the Jumping Fish ride, so parents who want to accompany their kids, beware of your knees. There are three bumper cars, one for kids, the other for children taller than 140cm. Both only seat one person, and for the kid one , parents are not allowed. The average wait there is 25 mins, while a ride is approximately anywhere between 6 - 20mins.

There are not enough space for visitors to hide from sun ray on the 'magic island'. 4. Don't go there on the weekend. 5. Foods are expensive and crappy in Lotte world. 6.

We spent around 5 hours here during a weekday and we managed to visit all the main rides (although one or two rides were out of service). The only problem we had was that we enjoyed trying to cram in as many rides as possible, that by the time we finished up, we realised the park was closing and all food and snack shops were closing up. You wont need more than 5 hours here in this park and its very easy to reach by MRT.

We proceeded to utilize the magic pass mobile app in hopes to snag a magic pass however the app was loading the whole time and could not even get us to the landing page.  We went on to walk around the premises to see if there were attractions with shorter queue. As we walked on, the app finally loaded and we checked on waiting time to see a few attractions 0-15min wait. Upon rushing it, were we told that the ride was under maintenance which was why the app reflected such a short waiting time.  The park had similar naming rides that we rushed in order to make it in time for the magic pass only to know that we were at the wrong location. After an hour or so, we so frustrated by what's happening that we went to the customer service counter to see what else Lotte World could offer. We were shocked to know that at the point of our query, only a total of 8 rides (and they were all kiddie attractions) or lesser were available as all the others were under maintenance!  I can't imagine heading into a theme park and wanting out so badly due to what is happening. We were there for 3hours, 1 hour was spent on lunch and the remaining 2 was spent finding and getting rejected from rides.

Some of the ride had light upgrade, a few new ride, but majority of rides are stayed exact same and need some touch up in my opinion.  I visit there on Monday expecting little less people than the weekend, but there was so many people üòû, so each ride takes long waiting (of course). My kids had enjoyed I am sure, but for the price I paid, it was so so in my opinion. Not the best place for toddler for sure.","Written April 7, 2018"

For a first timer with young family, we did not realize that we need to literally ‚Äústalk‚Äù the app every 15 mins to secure those precious slots.

Since the slots are gone literally 3 seconds after each time period opens, it‚Äôs a race of fast fingers.  Of our couple of hours there, we couldn‚Äôt get on that many.

304,mercurio_venice,2.0,"I had heard that Lotte World is one of the busiest amusement parks in the world (apart from Disney and Universal Studios parks). So we decided to visit it. Honestly, it's not a good amusement park. I would advise people to not go. I have not been to Everland, but surely it can't be worse. The only reason I can think that Lotte World is busy is that it is in the city centre area beside 3 or 4 big shopping malls, so I guess people who are around find it convenient to visit. But I can't imagine anyone going for more than 1 visit. And I don't recommend that anyone visit it even once.  The indoor part of Lotte World feels like a bunch of mediocre amusement park rides have been shoved into a shopping mall on 3-4 floors. Making matters worse, there is a bit of a bad smell around the space. We went on a few rides in the indoor part (a dinosaur shooting one and a flight simulator one) - they were somewhat copies of Disneyland rides, but not even 1/4 as good.  The outside area of Lotte World was not very big, connected via a bridge over the highway. There is a castle in the middle (copy of disneyland), and the main ""thrill"" rides seemed to be the rides that either go from side to side (like a ricking ship ride) or that spin. We didn't go in tot the haunted house as I read a review to avoid it. We went on a Monday and the wait for those average-looking ""thrill"" rides was 40 minutes. Those rides remind me of old-stlye travelling amusement parks that go to various cities with basic rides. Really there is not much more than that, from what we could see, at Lotte World.  It was a real letdown. We left very early.","Written April 1, 2018"

310,Julia L,5.0,"Visited Lotte world with my 11 year old pre teen. Booked tickets on KLOOK - got the one with 5 premium magic passes each. Did not regret it one bit. These magic passes are used like the Disneyland fast passes, simply present the passes (indicated on the ticket and struck off once used for a ride) , enter a separate queue for magic pass and board the ride! It was challenging trying to obtain magic passes using the app - the entrance ticket itself includes 3 magic passes - but these are subject to availability. We did not bother obtaining any after failing in the first hour.  To avoid the crowd, we purposely visited on a Monday. Got in at 930 once the park opened. Finished the thrill rides by 1130 with merely 5-10 min queues each. By noon the lines were snaking around. But it didn't look too bad - wait time was 15-30 min max. We opted to use our premium magic passes for repeat rides which my daughter really enjoyed! The park was most crowded from mid afternoon onwards. Our favorites were the Atlantis and gyro swing. (We are adrenaline junkies) Unfortunately the gyro drop and French Revolution were closed for maintenance.  For the price paid, it was a fun day out! Very value for money. Do not forget to explore the underland - these were the bulk of the VR rides- so avoid if prone to get motion sickness or giddy.  Food was decently priced, not exorbitant for a theme park. A large drink and popcorn chicken went for 6000won. Please do yourself a favor and rent a locker - 1000won only - per use - can't open repeatedly.","Written March 16, 2018"

Before we went here, we already put in our mind this theme park was not Disneyland so we didn't expect it to be like Disneyland. We bought out tickets from Klook. When we bought, Klook offered the cheapest price (around 27,000 krw) than any other online ticket. We redeemed our tickets in south gate (entered the room for group ticketing to redeem the voucher).  When we were there, it was very cold and all of outdoor rides didn't operated. It made indoor rides had a long queued. But for kiddies rides, the queue was not long enough. As for food, we preferred to eat at Lotty's Garden, because of its varieties and price.  Rather than the rides, we loved the parades most.

Going on Lunar New Year Eve, it was particularly crowded and most of our time was spent in queues. There was even a hot air balloon ride inside (much like a Ferris wheel, really) which had a queue of 100 mins!!!

Do take note that if you have purchased your tickets through 3rd party vendors like Klook, you will need to change to a physical ticket at South Gate.  The indoor amusement park has a few floors. It has a roller coaster which is quite thrilling. There are lots of rides for all ages but I felt indoors are mostly catered to the younger children.

There are a variety of different roller coasters, crazy spin you upside down rides, just cruising ""slow paced"" rides, 3D attractions, A HAUNTED HOUSE (really liked this one), and lots of fun rides for the kids. They also had a parade at night which was pretty interesting. This place is pretty big so I would suggest making good use of the map and pick the places you would like to try and check out. I would also recommend checking different sites for tickets on sale. I went with my sisters & friends and what made this place fun was being able to hang out with friends enjoy different attractions together.

Yes, the attendant measured the kids but the parents clearly held their children up on their tippy toes or in the air and attendants acted as if they were unaware of what happened or they chose to not remeasure the kids although it was evident that kids were the same height as they stood next to each other. What‚Äôs more insulting is that while IÔ∏è was directed that IÔ∏è can file a complaint at guest services, once in their office they did not understand what a complaint was and resulted to not being able to understand any English. Issue never was resolved. Disappointed my children did not get to ride the rides that they should of been able to enjoy. Although it‚Äôs an outside amusement park, Everland was by far better.

We were there 11.30am - 9pm and honestly, only manage to cover the whole indoor adventure park but for outdoor, barely cover 20%. Will highly recommend families to stay whole day. If you wish to visit the Lotte Aquarium or Pororo Park, please arrange separately as the 1 Day pass for your to enter Lotte World theme park, when you exit, cannot re-enter.  I had gone to Pororo Park on 2 other days; 2 hours (this is the limit for the ticket entry price) on each day. The small playground with slide, rooms with Lego blocks and building blocks, Pororo & Friends performance, the big bouncing castle, carousel (only open for small intervals on weekday), ferries Wheel and bumper car are all really fun for both my kids. Although it is more crowded on weekend, the rides are all more frequent, hence don‚Äôt really need to queue much. Personally, think my kids had more fun on weekend as they manage to catch more rides during the 2 hours compared to a weekday.

The place looks old but certainly was great in the 70's. (Wanna ice skate - pay extra...). To make the place a little more contemporary - we are in high tech Korea, right ? - a VR room and a Wild Jungle VR ride was added. The VR ride was not really state of the art, but well done and certainly one of the rides to do. The Sindbad boat Ride was OK, but not recommended for kids. Looking for food, don't be confused.

The park is good, but perhaps a little pricey for what it is. The rides are on the same scale as say Legoland. Don't expect anything that will leave you wanting to ride again. There are some food outlets which vary in quality. The high points are the water log ride, the Zombie VR area and the Korean Heritage area. There is a huge shopping mall attached which should suit every need. Annoyingly you would need a more expensive day pass to be able to enter the park, then leave to go shopping, then re-enter later on, even though it's all the same Lotte complex.

406,Greg B,4.0,"So here's the facts you need to consider:  Best to go during the week whereby you can purchase tickets at a lower cost. Next. Arrive as close to opening time as you can to ensure short lines. If not happy about long lines, purchase a Magic Pass (a fair bit more expensive) that takes you to the front of the queue. Note that once queue's build up substantially - which they do - many of the rides close the expensive Magic Pass. In other words, get there the earlier the better. Weekends are terribly busy meaning long lines.  Lotte World truly caters for all ages (not necessarily those over 65 who Lotte World believe are too old to go on some of the rides!) with a myriad of toddler, child and adult rides.  Now to what really upsets me: You'd think that the entry fee would cover everything (aside from food etc of course). Well, it doesn't. Indeed, there are many areas requiring you to spend extra! Take the Ice Rink for example; it is completely autonomous to the adventure park, even though it is right in the middle of it.  You can have a great day at Lotte.

There was a parade when we arrived and I was surprised at the outfits. I felt like I should have had dollar bills in my hand - making it rain. The dads and guys seemed to like it!  The Sinbad ride was exciting and the hot air balloon ride was worth the wait.  Everything was worth seeing the kids' faces. They ran from ride to ride in sheer bliss.  Arcade, ice skating, rides, food, beer - rides for toddlers and babies and some rides parents can join, which makes great for photos.  Might get wet outside in the summer.  Get a discount or don't go.  Friendly staff and very safe atmosphere.  You could spend the whole day here, tire the kids out, and then get a bite to eat and do some shopping.

445,Ryann,4.0,"I went here as part of my college university in Seoul, so I can't tell you much about ticketing since it was free for me, HOWEVER I can tell you what to expect inside. After handing your ticket to the people in the front they will return it, MAKE SURE YOU KEEP IT ON YOU BECAUSE SOME RIDES WILL ASK FOR PROOF OF PURCHASE! If you go in the morning I highly suggest hitting the outside rides first, just because it's still cool outside and the lines will be relatively short. For those that have a waist line bigger than 32 inches, some rides might not be good for you just based on the fact that in Asia, many things, including roller coasters are built for smaller people. I am a larger woman, and i was able to ride the bumper cars, the spin guro, the hot air balloons, the carasole, and there were a few others that I opted out of that would be accommodating to larger people. Bring your own food. While there is food in the amusement park, and it is relatively cheap in comparison to parks in the U.S. it is still just amusement food. I ate at ""school food"" which has some good kimbap and ddeokbokki. If you have younger ones, or if you're not good with big crowds then definitely avoid the weekends where it gets pretty packed and the lines get lengthy (it was an hour for the hot air balloons).

I like that rides are of varying thrill levels, making it suitable for kids as well as thrill-seekers. I would definitely recommend it for families even with young children as they have a huge kiddy play section.

Even for the hot air balloon, we had to queue for 60 minutes which I feel that it is not worth the wait. Most of the time was spent waiting, hence it was rather annoying for us.  I understand that there is an app which allows us to book the timing in advance but it is not working that well. Though it mentioned that the next booking timing but whenever, the booking is opened, the app will hang and by the time it recovers, the booking is closed again.  However, 1 plus point is that it is air conditioned hence not as hot as other theme parks.

For those who want to escape from the summer heat will enjoy the fact that there are also many attractions in the indoor area. The rides are okay but some of the 3D shorting games was a tad disappointing. Avoid weekends and public holidays. We went on a weekday morning so it was relatively sane.

Check the weather really carefully because most of the awesome rides are outside The lines are super long if you go on the weekends. About 3 hours to the max. If you do not speak Korean and have a question just ask a staff. NOT a student. There are a lot of student who come for a school trip and they tend to get worried if you talk to them not because they think you're weird or anything. Most Korean people get all flustered if you speak with them. Try the snacks if you're willing to splurge. Try the VR French Revolution or the Haesung Tuk Gup. Its really fast and worth waiting for. You can also reserve you ride with an app. You can reserve up to three rides I believe. Also check the official site for special event discounts. For example if it were Halloween if you have three of the same letter in your name as Halloween you get a discount. Check the official site and bring your ID with you. If you are spending the whole day go as early as possible. People in Korea wait about two hours before opening. Don't do that unless you want the full experience.,"Written May 31, 2017"

491,tumbleweedchris,4.0,"Lotte World is a park that is different than any other you've been to before. Most of the park is located in a huge mall with rides stuck in the walls of several different floors. There is also a small outdoor section that maximizes its space by going underground. Lotte World is not short on attractions, but there is no single wow attraction there --- a lot of good ones, but no marquee. That's the one complaint I have about the park. Many of the rides are out of the box purchases from ride manufacturers. The rides are in no way modified and just plopped down here or there. With all of the rides though, how do you make it through everything in a day? Use the Lotte World app to book Fastpass times throughout the day. You get 3 free ones a day. Depending on what you like, you should make your choices some combination of Atlantis, French Revolution, Comet Express, Flume, and Pharaoh's Fury. These rides get the longest queues. Furthermore, you'll likely have to cut some rides out because of the volume of stuff there is to do. To me, the must do attractions are: Atlantis, Comet Express, Pharaoh's Fury, Adventures of Sinbad, and Aeronauts Balloon Ride. The rides that get a lot of attention, but you can skip are: French Revolution, Flume, and the Conquistador. The rides that don't get a lot of attention, but you shouldn't miss are: Castle Magic Show, Fantasy Dream, Jungle Adventure, and Fly Venture.","Written April 29, 2017"

493,AFSC Volunteer C,5.0,"Lotte World really IS the Korean version of Disneyland, and it has a lot of options to minimize the waiting. You can download the smart phone app (Lotte World Adventure), scan your tickets with your phone's camera, and reserve three Magic Passes (per ticket). It is mostly in English (just agree to the usual legalese in Korean to open). When you choose your ride, it will show you the next time available for the Magic Pass. Maps are available in many languages, so English-speakers can manage just fine.  There is an extensive selection of indoor attractions with additional rides outside. The castle and most of the thrill rides are outside. There was a nice balance between virtual rides that offer safe thrills (Fly Venture, Wild Valley, Wild Wing, etc.) and traditional rides like the log flume, several roller coaters, etc. Some hybrid rides like French Revolution were too much for me. We did this when it was cold and rainy, so the indoor location was perfect.  You can eat cheaply at the Lotteria (fast food burgers, chicken nuggets, etc,) or eat at a nice local-style restaurant. There is a variety to choose from with a broad range of prices. The shows are cute and popular, but be sure to check the times. Some only run twice a day, while other shows and parades run more frequently. Pick up the Times Guide.  If you still can't decide if it is a good fit for your family, review the rides and shows online (or in the free app) and see for yourself. We thought it was a bargain for all the fun we had. However, I would double-check to avoid Korean holidays if you don't like crowds.","Written April 26, 2017"

We had to search for forever to find the one ice cream shop that was more reasonably priced because it was EXTREMELY hot seeing that it was summer. It's half inside and half outside so that part was super cool. It was my first time seeing an amusement park inside. We ended up finding the ice cream shop. Since it's half inside you could go on a rainy day, but I would suggest going when you can enjoy both parts of the park. There are many rides that are copies of Disneyland so I would compare it to that. Not very thrilling, but everything was very cute. Couples everywhere. Must-go-to if you love amusement parks.

Although it's nice to go to the area around Lotte World because of the newly opened Lotte Sky Seoul Tower and it is also nice to take a walk along the Songpa district especially during spring when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. If you are staying at a Lotte Hotel branch, there is a free shuttle bus to and from Lotte World theme park. Can also easily be reached by subway (Jamsil station if I'm not mistaken). You can go around the park in just an hour or two.","Written April 12, 2017"
508,shouldisayit,4.0,"If you have been to Disneyland and are expecting something similar then you will be disappointed. However, if you want to spend a day hanging out with your little ones, especially if the weather is bad, then Lotte World has plenty to offer you.  If you do decide to go then make sure you get a discount voucher (available from most hotel lobbies/concierge) - you will find that a 20 percent discount will be offered.  Getting to Lotte World is easy on the MRT. Take the green line and get off at Jamsil station. The MRT signs point you towards Exit 3 (if you go out this way the head towards Charlotte Theatre and you will see one of the entrances/ticket office). Another option will be to head towards Exit 4, but you don't have to leave the underground pedestrian footpath to get to the entrance/ticket office.  It's not obvious, as it doesn't stipulate in English, but a Day Pass ticket entitles you to 3 Fast Passes for rides (although I'm not sure if this applies for Half Day Passes?). There are a few kiosks scattered inside that allows you to chose which rides Fast Passes are available on (normally within 45 minutes and not beyond). Alternatively download the Lotte World app and register your entrance ticket details to access Fast Passes via your phone. I believe that if you can buy Fast Passes if you go beyond the complimentary 3 that come with your day pass ticket.  Once inside it the multi-level and indoor and outside areas require a certain amount of orienteering. Rule of thumb is that the outside area has the majority of the fast/big rides; whilst the inside has about 3 big rides, but mainly caters to the young audience. We went as a family of 4 (two little ones under 7 yrs old), went on most of the rides that the children could ride on (they are quite strict on height), arrived at 1130am and left at 8.30pm. Exhausted.  Lotte World tries hard to imitate Disneyland. There are parade shows and a fairytale castle, but ultimately the lack of recognisable characters (no Mickey and Minnie et al) make them unmemorable. So forget the unmemorable merchandising and just go for the rides.  Lotte World does not check your backpack/handbags so you are free to bring outside food and drink with you.  PS The cherry blossom has just come into season and there are a number of trees surrounding the outside area that make it more memorable than it would be otherwise.","Written April 7, 2017"

My niece was forbidden to go to a couple of rides, since they have a height requirement, it was so sad after we waited for a long queue. The outdoor rides in magic island, were mostly for adults, In one of the rides we saw that there was a short queue in line so we asked one of the staff if we can go inside, the staff doesn't speak English well, so it was so hard to communicate, when we were about to turn our back because we do not understand what she was saying, she pulled us in the corner, and with few English words, she told us that she will help us go inside but we should be quiet about it and keep it as a secret. (I think that was what she meant ;) Then she gently pushed us inside When we got inside, there was still a queue in line but shorter, only to find out that the ride we got into (The Comet express) was not the ride we want to go to. It was like the roller coaster plus the seats rotates 360 degrees, we were sooo dizzy. We were hoping for a lighter ride but we were thankful to the staff( forgot her name), she did her best for us to experience the thrill..

My 11 year old was forbidden to ride many of the ""kid"" rides because of her height, but as a parent (taller than my daughter) I was allowed to accompany my younger children. We love Korea, but this is a typical example of the rigid, nonsensical (to the American mind) rule-following that is commonplace here. The kids were begging to leave by late afternoon, and we gladly obliged them. Overall, a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. I would recommend Everland over this place -- avoid Lotte World like the plague.","Written January 22, 2017"

551,stepstephaniestep,3.0,"Good Attraction, but you need to rethink about your trip plan!!  This is my 2nd time visiting Lotte World, bought the discount ticket (30% off) from Trip Maker through my guesthouse, and I went there on Saturday and omg that was a disaster!!!! Arrived there at 11am and left at 8pm (7 hours), I have spent almost 4 - 5 hours ONLY lining up and looked at my phone :(  No doubt the rides and everythings are cool and entertaining in the Lotte World, both indoor and outdoor, but there are sooooo many people; For the most famous rides like Gyro Spin and Atlantis, I have spent 45 mins queuing for each lel.  I don't think I need to describe how fun it is in the theme park since they are more or less the same seriously... yeah Lotte World makes you feel joyful and excited when you step in the indoor park, but for real, when you get closer to the ride and once you spot the end of the queue, and start lining up, and wait for 15 mins, and wait for 30 mins, still a long way to go, I am sure you will get mad. (I was with my boyfriend and we were getting more tired and even stopped talking...)  I strongly suggest my fellow travellers, try to avoid visit Lotte World on Friday/Saturday/Sunday!!!!!  My first visit to Lotte World back in 2014, I paid full-price and only spent 4 hours there becasue I was so fed up with the queuing.

Its a MUST visit for anyone with children, wanting to have fun on a business trip or just wanting to have something different to do. The Main rollercoaster is a BLAST, and would rival most coasters in any major park. The size of the park and all the things to see and do are amazing and well worth the coast of apprx. $65 per person to go in and ride the rides. you can purchase a $30 ticket but that won't allow you access to the rides.

581,Daniel B,4.0,"We went to Lotte World, on a beautiful October day in Seoul. Our guesthouse (Mmmio house, highly recommended) was close to a subway station and from there it took us about half an hour to get to Lotte World, on the other side of the river, which splits Seoul in two parts. Upon arrival at the Jamsil station (green line, 2, by subway), the signs direct you immediately to the Lotte Department Store and other Lotte ""things to do/see"", including Lotte Adventure World. As we prefer not to wait in line, we were excited to see ticket machines, which also displayed information in English. After having tried all of them we asked staff why the English version on the machines did not work and were told that the machines are not for foreigners. Staff very nicely directed us to the counter to buy tickets. Second in line, suddenly the counter closed and we were directed to another line. This was not nice but ok, since only about 6 people were waiting in front of us now. After half an hour (!!) waiting we could finally buy our ticket, but were asked for our passports. Not being made aware by anybody that we needed passports, I luckily realized that I had a residence card from another country with me. A few discussions later with different staff, we were allowed to buy four tickets. The cost, USD 150, seemed high. It was a fairly quiet day in the park, so the waiting for most attractions was not bad. The park has three or four levels and from each level you can see the levels below. There is also an outside area with more attractions. The park is in the middle of the city and it is quite amazing how they have used the limited space to build so many attractions. Although we had tickets which allowed us to access all attractions, we did have to pay for one attraction, the Tomb of horror (or something like that). It is approx USD 2.5 per person. Everland is a more recently opened amusement park and bigger than Lotte Adventure World, but further away. Early 2016, a brand new amusement park will be opened.","Written October 6, 2015"

I went from 11am to 6pm and I managed to ride almost all the rides.  Heads up first, for those who love crazy scary rides, this probably will not satisfy you 100%. However, for those like me, who enjoy a moderate level of fear rides, this will be an enjoyable trip! They do have one roller coaster that was said to be the scariest, but I didn't try it so I can't comment. However judging by the speed, loops I saw and the screams I heard, it should be satisfying for any fear-seekers.  The coolest part about this park was that it was indoors and outdoors. I loved the outdoors more cause it had more fun rides there! There was a ride I loved so much I went on it for at least 3 times.

We went on a Tuesday, got there at 11 (place opened at 9:30), went to the Comet, located in the outdoor section of the park (Magic) which we thought would be like Space Mountain from what I saw online. Wait time said 80 minutes. I would estimate we waited for 2 hours before we got on the actual ride, which was vaguely Space-Mountain-ish and mildly entertaining, but certainly not worth the wait. It was hot, so we went back inside to try to find another ride. All the ""thrill"" (coaster-type) rides listed a 120 minutes wait, which probably meant 2.5 hours. We wandered around inside a bit more (it is pretty cool to look at - they cram so much inside, including people!) until we decided to bail. A complete waste of money. Tried to be Disney but failed in every way. Disinterested employees, rides with too little capacity, signs ineffective (no lie, it took us 25 minutes to find the way back out to the street!). If you must go, don't pay the all-inclusive ticket (48,000 won for adults, barely cheaper for kids), pay the cheaper ticket price, wander around and pay for rides as you go (supposedly you have this option), if you can actually get on any.","Written August 4, 2015"

Do you want to feel more like a dollar sign and less like a human?  If you answered yes to these then Lotte World is for you!  The whole place is terribly busy and designed poorly, you feel crampt even not waiting in a line. When your waiting in a line prepare for camping a couple of hours with most main rides taking at least 120min wait. The rides that didn't, are poor or average at best.  The eating areas were open right next to rides so prepare for a noisy experience when you want to relax for lunch. Like dining in a club.  Many attractions inside actually cost money, so when you see a big queue and head for the short queue, you find it costs ‚Ç©3000.  The staff were very rude and not fun. They didn't care about their customers and didn't have that fun land happy attitude I would expect from such a place.  All in all the place was dull... With crampt almost unfinished rendered corridors at parts with dull lighting it almost seemed like each area had its own budget and refused to fund the walkways between.  Honestly everything that fails at this place is a win at Everland. Some people say they hate the happy music and smiles of Everland, but a place like this should be that way and trust me happy cheerful smiles go a long way to make the scene.  A final note  Please, just accept these things and you will have a good time.

599,Karyn W,4.0,"When we were in Seoul we wanted to do an amusement park. We were told there were two good ones and this one was better for younger kids. Since we had an 8 year old that enjoys roller coasters we thought it'd be better to do this one and if we came back in the future to do the other park. We had a great time here.  We took the subway and it was very easy to walk there from the station. This park is about 2/3 inside and 1/3 outside. We did most of the inside and only a few of the outside, as it was raining and when it's wet they close the outdoor coasters. They did open them in the afternoon but not all and we didn't get to do everything.  Inside there are 4 floors. On the top is an Egyptian ride we liked probably best of all with lots of cool replicas and stuff, and a hot air balloon ride which went around the entire inside part. It was a cool view and there was a special tunnel part but the wait was crazy long!  On the 3rd floor was the monorail but it was closed because of the rain. And another ride called Jungle Adventure. The 2nd floor has a fast roller coaster and bumper cars.  The 1st floor had most of the rides from a swinging boat, a water ride with a big splash, carousel, and a ride with a 360 on it. There was a ride called Drunken Basket which was like the mad hatter tea cups at Disneyland.  Below the 1st floor you could see a big ice skating rink, but we did not go down there. I cost extra.  Outside was one of those ride where you site in a big ring around a tower that goes all the way to the top and then drops you (I hate those) in your seat and goes partially back up and does it again a few times. There were two coasters that were closed, a walk through ghost house, a ferris wheel, magic show and more. One part of the haunted house scared/upset my son a little bit with a cat becoming a ghost. There was also a big castle you could walk through outside.  There were several shows/performances with people in costumes. They seemed geared toward little (under 6 crowd) on the first floor. There was a tram that came through and there were ladies hanging off the side like Vegas show girls, very sparkly with exotic outfits. The park has two main mascots, Lotty and Lorry and their faces and likeness were on lots of things throughout the park. There were some animatronics.  They park did have a fast pass type thing called Magic Pass to get a ticket to go to the front of the line at a later time. You constantly had to show your admission ticket to ride things since they have an all day unlimited and a like 10 ride pass. I lost mine but they didn't make a big deal about replacing it, though they said I only get one replacement.  There were a lot of food options with a good amount of variety actually. You could get Korean food, hotdogs, pizza, burgers, Chinese, kebabs, and more. The food we got wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad either.  There were lots of shops to buy things at and we bought some cat ear headbands that my son loved so much he wore the rest of our trip in Korea.  Our visit was such a very fun day.

In true Korean form, I received a 50% off discount on the entrance price ""because of my birthday;"" which is Korean for ""we give Americans free stuff!""

602,LoungeLizardLLC,4.0,This is a Korean take on the Theme park. It has 4 good coaster/rides which we rode multiple times. It is quite compact but really well laid out.  I really liked the indoor section as this is not something usual for most theme parks.  Beware when it rains that outside rides may not run.  Although nothing like the big US parks it has a strangely quirky and characterful feel to it which we found endearing.,"Written May 7, 2015"

Upon entering, they have no maps or explanations of how big its gonna be. Then we learn that it has an inside park of about 5 floors High and an outside park.  True, it was a Disney knockoff- but they did a very good job doing it. It also had a very different happy place vibe to it. Amazing! It had something similar to pirates of the carribean, temple of doom/raiders of the lost arc jungle ride; a toy story shooting game like 3Dmovie. Plus an atlantis roller coaster of seaworld. A magic kingdom photo-op too!  Photos cannot capture it. You have to go see it for yourself. It was fun!","Written May 3, 2015"
604,biba_7,4.0,"My two preteens consider themselves amusement park aficionados and have been to the big Florida parks as well as several smaller European parks. They ranked their experience at Lotte World as among the best because of its size (not too gigantic), the variety of rides and activities (from mellow to heart pounding) and atmosphere (easy-going). We do not speak or read Korean yet found our way around the indoor/outdoor park easily. We visited on a weekday and did not have to contend with crowds. There were two rides temporarily closed for inspection, but one did reopen during our visit. Lots of dining options within the park as well as souvenir stands (but also easy to avoid if you would prefer). It is easy to spend an entire day here. Indeed they are open to 11PM, 365 days a year! And if you are looking for a quiet alternative from the colorful fun park, your ticket will also allow you admission the excellent Lotte World Folk Museum. (On the third level, past the balloon rides inside.)The miniature village dioramas were utterly charming. On the other end of the spectrum, the sports level with an ice rink, water slides and pool was also a big hit. We saw people of all ages enjoying the park amenities.","Written April 28, 2015"

The rides were of high standard and offered some great excitement and are made of modern and quality materials. Restaurants, cafes and snack stalls/stores are widely available and you don't have to walk far until you come across the next one.  While everything is huge, impressive and contemporary, it seemed quite dull and lifeless to me. There were some nice things to see but the overall experience was just... boring to be honest. I'm sure it's different for kids, but there are theme parks that can excite even the dullest of adults.  We also found the price to be quite steep, the day pass was close to USD 50.00. Should you decide not to take any rides, their entry fee was still pretty hefty at USD 31.00 for a day.

We took advantage of the 50% off with military ID (or dependent) - thankfully had the kids IDs too since it's only good for 4 tickets. We spent 5 hours there and no one did everything but we filled every minute with fun. The teenagers and tweens took off and did their own thing at the park, even managed to get their ticket replaced on their own when one of them lost theirs. Reminder, you need to show your ticket at every ride so keep it handy and on each person if possible. They did the indoor roller coasters and outdoor ones as well. The moms took the younger set to do all that was available and didn't get through all of it! Fair food is very good, especially the soda/fried cheese balls combo, always a hit with my guys. 9 year olds went on the log flume solo which was about a 15 minute wait at 12 noon and loved it. Too bad our favorite ride, the Dinosaur 3D target practice was closed for inspection. And the kids really enjoyed the trick eye exhibit on 4F.

Lotte World isn't as pristine as Disney parks, but it is cheaper, and less crowded. All of the rides had fairly long waits later in the day. It seemed like when school got out, all of Seoul's youngsters came here. We had fun, but I don't think we would go back.

630,kimahrikku,3.0,"Lotte World is advertised as the World's Largest Indoor Amusement Park. It surely feels like it. The huge dome with its central skating ring and surrounding rides are an impressive sight. Having such a large park in the heart of a 25 million metropolis is amazing. However, Lotte World might not be your best option for entertainment in or around Seoul. Lotte World is straight up inferior to Everland ride-wise, with fewer rides, especially thrill rides such as roller coasters, which also means that each ride will be packed with quite a long line that can top an hour for the best rides. So if you're a roller coaster enthusiast, I recommend checking out Everland instead. In addition, the park is 25 years old and feels like it. It doesn't feel quite new, especially for outside attractions. The park's attractions and stores all have this ""slightly off"" color and design that didn't age all too well. Also, the Lotte World now fails in comparison to the building next door, the new 2nd Lotte World complex, which features numerous dining and shopping options, as well as what will soon become the tallest tower in the OCDE. Overall, I do recommend checking out the park and its surroundings, but would advise against staying there an entire day. The good thing is that for people who come in rather late in the afternoon, the park offers discounted price, and that's a great value proposition to just come in and enjoy the park for 3 or 4 hours rather than the entire day.","Written December 18, 2014"

But it's a gas and great to immerse in the Korean candy world of a theme park. Off the shelf prices are pretty high but there seems to be many ways to get a discount.","Written July 17, 2014"

As it was December winter, I supposed the locals escape the freezing temperature and went to Lotte to keep their warm. Lotte was extremely crowded and all the rides were in a long Q. We managed to grab some interesting rides but the rest of day was spent roaming indoor. It was good that it had their ""Trick Eyes"" section. We had some guns taking wonderful photos as it saved our time having to travel to the actual ""Trick Eyes"" in Hondae.","Written July 2, 2014"

To start, I was quite dissapointed that I could not use my own skates because they where hockey skates. That was the first time i had ever experienced that, but its a business... The ice was crowded, your not allowed to skate backwards and for the price of admission(about 10,000won) the sheet was poorly maintained. If you are going here to skate, Seoul has WAY BETTER places than this. Check out Mock-dong, Korea University, and I'Park(winter only).","Written June 28, 2014"

After, we head straight to the Hot Air Balloons.. love how they float them and travel in the Lotte World for one round. After this, we went opposite Lotte World where the rides are. The rides are more for big kids, not mine. We took a kiddy train ride and head back to the main building. The weather was hot and sunny. The food sold at kiosks do not taste as good as it looks.

You pay $60-70 for Disneyland HK and Tokyo, but I paid only $20; there were plenty of deals to cut the ticket price cut to the half. It's not definitely like dreamland (Disneyland or Universal Studios) or extreme ultimatim (Six-Flags), but I made sure to visit off peak hours, so that I didn't need to queue for a while. The portfolio or rides and equipments were very well balanced, from family to epic-high stuff, and the mixture of indoor and outdoor. Food inside is quite good but pricey as any other amusement parks. There are gourmet restaurants outside the park, so make sure to come out and enjoy the food and shopping. The parade & circus show are something kids love about. I'd visit again. Make sure to avoid weekend or summer time, when youngsters come any time and cause a long queue.","Written May 28, 2014"

It takes forever for you to be able to ride an attraction. They say that patience is a virtue but I'd rather visit other attractions in Seoul than to wait there for atleast an hour or 2 to be able to enjoy. The only atrraction that won't take too long are the kiddie rides but I tell you, they are boring.

Nearby are great restaurants, hotels, and a small lake (Seokchon Lake) which is a nice walk just outside of the park. There are nice coffee shops towards the backside entrance of the park and plenty of parking. It's been 23 years since I've been here but still great!  On the lower side, there's a place called ""Pororo Park"" which is great for younger kids. Pororo is a popular TV animation which comes to life at the Pororo Park.

However, the longer queue took only 30 minutes. Our kids loved the theme park, especially the Camelot Carousel, World monorail, kids bumper cars and train rides. However, we were disappointed that the balloon rides for small kids were under maintenance. We suggested family with small kids should do some homework prior visiting.

675,Fanazmi,3.0,"Chose Lotte World over Everland due to cold weather and that rides in Everland was not running 100% as the day temperatures were below 0¬∫C. Distance was also a deciding factor and the fact that Lotte World boast to be the largest indoor theme park in the world attracted us to it.  Fairly easy to get to the park via the Seoul Subway. Ticketing and entry was relatively smooth. Unknown to us, the period when we were visiting coincided with the high school holidays, thus resulting in very large numbers of teenagers. Both the indoor and outdoor rides have an average waiting time of about 90 minutes with some going as long as 120 minutes. Now here is the bad thing about Lotte World or any other theme parks in Korea. Queue cutting/jumping is an accepted practice here. I read about it on some theme parks forums but couldn't believe the extent or severity of it until I was there to witness it myself. Example, the person in front of you will, at some point of time, either by texting on their handphone or shouting at their friends, will ""invite"" his or her friends to join him in the queue. It could be as little as just one person to as much as 10 people. This happens at all the rides and is rampant, even with the theme park officials helping the queue jumpers get to their friend that was already in the queue. It was simply unacceptable and appalling for non-Koreans visitors.  On the way out, meet a theme park official and gave them feedback on the problem of queue cutting/jumping. The theme park was apologetic and understood my frustrations and offered another day of free entry as a form of goodwill gesture. We took up the offer and faced the same problems the next day......... :-(  Connected to the Lotte World is a shopping mall that offers quite an extensive selections of shops and eateries. An alternative for those who wish to take a break from the theme park. Take note though, Lotte World entry passes does not allow for re-entry after leaving the theme park area.","Written December 24, 2013"

Food options in outdoor park is mainly finger food. More restaurant options are available in the indoor park. Big bugbear for me is that your entrance ticket does not allow you to step out of the park at all. Perhaps this is deliberate to get you to patronise from their eateries since there will be much more cheaper and better food options nearby just outside the park.

So, no, Lotte World is not Disney World and it's never going to be Disney World, but it also doesn't charge what Disney World charges. If you are trying to decide whether or not to take your kids to Lotte World, then just go. For the price you simply can't beat it. We took our daughter for her 9th birthday, and she is a thrill ride junky. Lucky for us the outside area opened up (it was raining early that morning), and the rides on Magic Island were open and running. There are several rides inside that she enjoyed, but most of the indoor rides and for little kids. As a family, we had a blast. There is a great variety of rides for our 9 year old AND our 3 year old. Here are some key things you need to know prior to going; 1. They are very strict about the height requirement for every single ride. In fact, they will probably measure your kids and then slap a wrist band on them (similar to the type you get at the hospital), indicating the height of your child. There is no smooth talking any of the attendants, if your kid misses the height by an inch, that's it, they don't make it on the ride. 2. If you do not favor Korean food, they have hotdogs, corn dogs, a hamburger joint, and a pizza place. The pizza looked off, and we attempted to order 4 beef hamburgers for approx. 5 solid minutes, and we got everything from shrimp burgers to chicken patties on the tray. We ended up just taking the chicken patties, which were a little off. They came with mayo and teriyaki sauce on them. We didn't like them at all. The parking is easy to get to, but since Lotte World is in a busy part of the city, I would recommend the subway system. 3. You have to be 6 years or older to skate on the ice rink. We brought socks for everyone but decided not to go when we found out our 3 year old couldn't skate. 4. Once you leave Lotte World there is no reentry. We were looking smack dab at a TGIFs but couldn't get to it because we wouldn't be allowed back in. Bottom Line - GO FOR IT. It's definitely worth it.

Both me and the person I was travelling with suffer some medical problems which mean its better to go back to the hotel for a rest and to take medication, also wanted to look around the shops there and get something to eat. We asked when buying a day pass that we needed to do this and the person at the counter said it was fine. When we attempted to leave the staff refused to let us leave and said if we leave we wont be allowed back in unless we pay for another day pass. They were unprofessional and rude, and I was thinking it could be a language mistake. so after multiple questions we demanded to see someone who could speak English fluently, they confirmed this was the rule but this staff member was very friendly and arranged for us to be let in after we left, it was a ridiculous rule as ive been to theme parks all over the world and never not been let out before! Please keep in mind that this is an even more stupid rule because the indoor theme park is a part of a huge shopping complex, and outside the gates are multiple food courts and restaurants, inside the park is a very limited range of food or shops and is also more expensive. The whole complex is owned by Lotte aswell, so I dont know what the problem is in letting people out. It seemed most of the locals had yearly passes so were allowed to come and go as they pleased.  We first noticed on arrival that the staff were very unfriendly, and rude, some even look like life is so painful they would gladly be euthanized if given the option, this was quite disappointing as we came here to have a happy day out at the end of a long trip but ended up being quite downbeat due to their attitude and poor organisation. I was told that this was the Korean way though! Disneyland is the happiest place on earth for a reason and this place doesn't come close!  The park is very hard to find things, you can see a ride that looks interesting but walk around for hours looking for the entrance to it! Staff had no English skills mostly so wasn't any use to ask them. Signage was really bad, Especially bad that very little was in English as-well.  Most of the more exciting rides were closed for maintenance or had extremely long lines so we were forced to go on the less popular ones. The park is clearly a poor copy of a Disney park but it could be so much better with a little work. We were adults but also noticed there werent many rides for younger children, but the Sinbad ride was very good for all ages for people who dont like thrill rides but still want a little adventure with the drops and everything.  The Parades were disorganised but interesting to watch. I would recommend going to Lotteworld if its a less busy day and if you like theme parks, definitely wouldn't attempt going here on the weekend or a public holiday.  The guidebooks say to get off at a certain train station, but again theres no signage to LOTTEWorld, or any map or guide to say where it was or even where the entrance was, was very confusing and we got there later than expected due to this.  Unfortunately poor communication and organisation lets this park down in what could be a really amazing experience. Part of what I liked about it was that it was a theme park in a new country so a new experience.","Written January 28, 2013"

There was also some odd whymiscal rides that felt wierd, but generally it was a day well spent.  Not too crowded, and although we had to wait 10 minutes to get on the French Revolution (roller coaster) it was the longest wait the whole day...  Even though the crowds were queuing at the Gyro Drop, the large number of seats and the quick turnaround meant that it was only a five minute wait (try to find that at most other World-class theme parks in Asia)  The choice of food was somewhat limiting as we couldn't find a good dining place that satisfied the tastebuds of both adults and kids at the same time... but in the end we tried something simple and it worked out ok.

It was quite chilly when we visited so we spent more time indoors than outdoors.

Wish there was better variety of food apart from burgers, hot dogs and candy floss. Seems to be a lot of junk food on sale.  We purchased one day passes which allowed us unlimited number of rides.

726,WanderingGI,4.0,"The Lotte brand is everywhere in Korea from supermarkets to fast food to sky scraper apartment complexes covering several city blocks. Lotte also made several cartoon characters to advertise their brands. These Korean cuddly characters cover the walls and wander around in costume in the huge, indoor-outdoor Lotte World amusement park. The sheer size of the indoor portion of the park is amazing. It is eight stories from the ice skating rink at the bottom to the balloon ride on the ceiling, all indoors with carnival style mini rides to fair sized roller coasters. None of the rides compare to a Six Flags experience, but it is INDOORS! This is a huge feat of engineering, but more importantly, it makes it a comfortable experience in the monsoon season, the hot and humid summer or the unbearably cold winters. There are more rides outdoors. My 12 year old son loved the two towers. One is a tower drop, the other is a tower shot. They also have another roller coaster and a few other rides outside. When the weather is good, the outdoor rides make it worth the trip for older kids or ride junkies like me. Overall, it is a great destination for families with little kids or older ones looking for something to do in Seoul. Being in the Army, we get US holidays off that allow us to visit tourist destinations on Mondays while the rest of Seoul is in school or at work. I've heard the lines are longer than an hour for most rides on the weekends. We waited 45 minutes for the indoor roller coaster. The weather was perfect, but the lines were much shorter outdoors. I almost forgot to mention one of the funniest parts of the visit: the translations on the dual language signs! I'm surprised that such a big-name corporation like Lotte must have used an auto translation for their signs.

My first experience (2009), a group of foreign friends went very early on a Saturday morning (Korean students were in session that day for a half day). We got a 'foreigner discount' (I think this is very unfair) and as we were some of the first people in the park, we went up the escalator and found the entire mascot crew and marching band at the top preparing for their work day.

Best to arrive first thing when the crowds are small and queues are short - go to the most popular rides first - Atlantis, French Revolution, Pharaoh‚Äôs Rage etc. otherwise be prepared to queue for up to 2 hours when the crowd builds up especially in the holiday season.  The park is clean and well presented and offers a Disney-eque feel complete with their own Snow White Castle.  The entry ticket (we got 20% off using MasterCard) is generally all inclusive (a small handful of rides require extra payment). There is a range of food from local to western. Prices are generally higher than outside.

779,Angela L,4.0,"Went on a Wednesday morning but it was so packed with Korean teenagers, many in school uniform. It makes me wonder if that was a school excursion or it is a trend to visit theme Parks in school uniforms.  We reached there exactly at 9.30am and when the doors were opened, teenagers starting sprinting towards the rides and queues began to form.  Not intending to wait too Long for rides, we each paid 40000 won for the 5 rides express pass. The counter for express pass is located behind the famous Carousel ride. A paper band will be tied around your wrist. Just show the band to the personnel at the express ride queue and they will mark on the wrist band. Choose to use the wrist band wisely. Some rides have queues that move quite fast. Eg the pirate ship ride which allows 60 riders or more per rid, so one should not use the wrist band here. The express pass is really useful for rides that have queues up to 1h Long. Atlantis and French Revolution have Super Long queues and these are reall high intensity fun rides! Use your express pass here! Gyro Swing is another ride which has ridiculously Long queue.

The employee looks not so enthusiastic (though not impolite / rude), and not efficient in managing the crowd, which is surprising because Korean are normally quite fast in working.

Compared to the disneyland in LA, lotte world is like 1/10 the size. It's just so tiny and the rides were not really ""thrilling"" at all.

The problem we found was that it didn't include the three Magic Passes which enables you to skip the queue using either an app or the vending machine outside the ride. Going on Lunar New Year Eve, it was particularly crowded and most of our time was spent in queues. There was even a hot air balloon ride inside (much like a Ferris wheel, really) which had a queue of 100 mins!!! In sum, it was interesting, cute, had some cool VR rides (did the three 'Wild' ones), but it was an exhausting day. PS. Skip the haunted mansion...

Yes, the attendant measured the kids but the parents clearly held their children up on their tippy toes or in the air and attendants acted as if they were unaware of what happened or they chose to not remeasure the kids although it was evident that kids were the same height as they stood next to each other. What‚Äôs more insulting is that while IÔ∏è was directed that IÔ∏è can file a complaint at guest services, once in their office they did not understand what a complaint was and resulted to not being able to understand any English.

Even for the hot air balloon, we had to queue for 60 minutes which I feel that it is not worth the wait. Most of the time was spent waiting, hence it was rather annoying for us.  I understand that there is an app which allows us to book the timing in advance but it is not working that well. Though it mentioned that the next booking timing but whenever, the booking is opened, the app will hang and by the time it recovers, the booking is closed again.  However, 1 plus point is that it is air conditioned hence not as hot as other theme parks. (We did not have enough time to explore the portion outside though we understand there are 2 portions to it)  For the younger kids, I think they enjoyed the magic show.","Written June 14, 2017"

928,JacquelineMa,3.0,If you have children and are at a loss of ideas on where to go Lotte World would provide your kids with hours of fun. From Myeongdong it takes less than an hour to travel to Jamsil station which is directly connected to the park. It's a huge place with indoor and outdoor area. For those who want to escape from the summer heat will enjoy the fact that there are also many attractions in the indoor area. The rides are okay but some of the 3D shorting games was a tad disappointing. Avoid weekends and public holidays. We went on a weekday morning so it was relatively sane. We didn't need to wait long for the rides. By afternoon we se hordes of school kids there for their school trip. Time to leave. It was a fun experience but not so impressive enough for me to want to visit again. Then again I'm not really into amusement Parks.,"Written June 8, 2017"

930,Kaylee K,5.0,I personally love Lotte World and expect to go there everytime I go to Seoul. I would recommend to spend the whole day here or you can go in after 4pm and have a discount. Check the weather really carefully because most of the awesome rides are outside The lines are super long if you go on the weekends. About 3 hours to the max. If you do not speak Korean and have a question just ask a staff. NOT a student. There are a lot of student who come for a school trip and they tend to get worried if you talk to them not because they think you're weird or anything. Most Korean people get all flustered if you speak with them. Try the snacks if you're willing to splurge. Try the VR French Revolution or the Haesung Tuk Gup. Its really fast and worth waiting for. You can also reserve you ride with an app. You can reserve up to three rides I believe. Also check the official site for special event discounts. For example if it were Halloween if you have three of the same letter in your name as Halloween you get a discount. Check the official site and bring your ID with you. If you are spending the whole day go as early as possible. People in Korea wait about two hours before opening. Don't do that unless you want the full experience.,"Written May 31, 2017"

The locals didn't seem to mind and perhaps that's a cultural thing but lining up for an hour then having a five minute ride, only to line up for another hour wore thin very quickly. I could only imagine it with a couple of kids (although again, no local kids seemed to mind from what I could tell!). Steep entry fee but it probably is worth a look just to actually view the place.","Written December 30, 2016"

There are attractions that you have to pay extra even if you get an all day pass. My 9 year old son was able to get in 5 attractions because of the long queue.

This park is almost exact copy of Disneyland down to the parades. But still is a good park in Seoul if you prefer not to travel to Tokyo which is the nearest for the real one. The indoor rides are more for the children and the outdoor rides are actually cater for the teenagers and adult alike.

1002,DrMichCHANG,5.0,The hotel has great facilities and easily accessible to public transportations and shopping malls. The room is spacious. We were staying on high floors and we had a nice city and scenic View. The staffs are friendly and helpful. My son has lost his bag in a cab when we were on our way to the hotel for check in. We only realized this at 10pm after our trip from the theme park. The staffs assisted us and contacted the driver. Their shuttle bus driver helped us to ferry the bag from Myeongdong to the hotel. The bag was sent to our room the next morning. We are thankful and appreciated their excellent services and efforts. They have the currency exchange services at the front desk. The KAL limousine bus stop is just in front of the hotel lobby. This helps us to save on our airport transfer. The cost to Incheon airport quoted by cab drivers to us was around 120 000 Korean won but the KAL bus ride is only 16 000 won per adult and 10 000 won per child from Lotte World hotel. Their female porter even assisted us with our luggages to the bus stop. We have a great time here and would surely return for our next trip to Seoul.,"Written December 23, 2016"

1004,729fair,4.0,"Lotte World is located in Chamsil within the city of Seoul at a subway stop for added convienience. Proximity wise it is along the Han river beyond ApkuJongDong (on the same side as Gangnam) and near the Olympic park area. I wouldn't necessary stay at the Lotte hotel attached as per my memory rooms were small and beds tiny. Better to stay near Coex at Park Hyatt if not then Intercontinental or further out at Grand Hyatt.  Lotte World has been around for many years and this review is mainly for the indoor adventure park which is attached to a huge shopping mall. Across the street (intersection) is the Lotte new world mall; the tallest building.  We were able to get discounted tickets for free use of the park for just about 20,000 won each (around 20 US) by using certain promotional related approved credit cards that relied mostly on LG or other card. You can check with the staff there but basically my Korean host paid for it and I chipped in.  On the lowest level is an ice skating rink. On the above levels around it is the adventure park and also folk village (separate entry). Once we paid for our tickets into the park we ate at one of restaurants around the upper level of the rink; found a small buffet called Seven springs which was decent. We then entered the park and spent a nice afternoon watching live performances (there were many and Xmas themed). It made us feel very cheerful for the holiday and the performances were impressive and festive. Especially rock n roll santa Elvis! There was a small gallery within the park that was enjoyable for photos. We did not ride many rides and the monorail we did ride seemed dated. There is an outdoor portion the park but it was too cold to go outside. The mirror maze was fun but a few extra Won just for that attraction. All other attractions were free per our entrance fee. This can be a low-key enjoyable family event and can't comment on if I would just go for the rides there because that's just not my cup of tea. There does seem to be a VR roller coaster (coaster updated with VR googles), various on top of water rides like indoor jungle boat and flume. There's an indoor kids play area which was too packed to stand in line for. The 'balloon' ride circling the park seemed like a very scenic and slow ride more so than monorail. The park has two main characters Lotte and Lorry and they are cute and the concessions cheap enough to wear and have fun with.  The folk village is nice to have nearby for folks who want a taste of Korea and history. For a real taste of Korean history go to Geongbokgung to walk the palace grounds and museum and nearby Insadong to buy souvenirs and tea.  Lotte mall lower level has a food court option I think Hyundai dept stores have more impressive food courts. The mall itself is affordable to expensive depending on what you are looking for.  Lotte new world mall (tall building) has newer stores to shop and a decent aquarium on the basement. A modern place to eat there on street level is Bills.  This entire block of Lotte malls and attractions would like fill a few afternoons of fun and variety needed for everyone.","Written December 23, 2016"

I think the park carter to younger kids, most rides are familiar and expected to be in a theme park, nonetheless, the kids still had a great time.

It was because that although we woke up early, got to Lotte World, it still many people were waiting to go inside. Moreover, the rapid function was not enough to let we to play all game and rides.

The food hall was my favourite place to go when I needed something a little more western, and it's well connected by subway so it's also a great place to go during the winter months. And when you get bored of shopping, there's the amusement park. I had heard a lot about Lotte World Amusement Park and I was interested in seeing how they'd make it work being indoors. I've got to say they've done it pretty well. Spread over a few floors, the themeing is beautifully done and you tend to forget that outside there's a mall full of busy shoppers. It is geared towards younger children, but the rides are still super fun, and there are a few thrill rides to keep the adults happy. There's the usual korean food brands, and a loads of confectionary stands. You can even buy facial products! I'd definitely recommend checking it out if you have a spare day.","Written July 6, 2016"

The coupon said we had to have our passports to show we were foreigners, but they never checked for them. We took 3 kids, 11, 12, 13 with us, and they really enjoyed themselves. There were rides and activities for everyone to enjoy. We went mid-week to avoid longer lines, and I think that was a good call. Our longest wait was 45 minutes for the big roller coaster. We were annoyed that outside several of the big rides were closed. This was not advertised and was disappointing. Unlike parks in North America, our bags were not searched for food, so we were able to carry in some healthy snacks. We bought lunch and ice cream inside at pretty reasonable prices. Bathrooms are nice, water in taps and fountains is potable. The park has a lot to offer, but is pretty compact which is nice as were weren't totally exhausted from long walks between rides.

1085,dixiepAZ,3.0,"You know how a Samsung phone is fine if that's all you have, but the design and interface pales in comparison to an iPhone? Lotte World is like that compared to a Disneyland experience. It's modeled after Disneyland, but is an obvious fake, but entertaining to see nonetheless.  We managed to visit with an online 50% off deal for foreign passport holders for 24,000 Won each (about $20 USD). So for that price, it was a fine thing to do. The wait for rides was 60-90 minutes in the heat with nothing to look at, not like at Disneyland where the lines are even an immersive part of the ride.  Atlantis was a great ride that we did twice. French Revolution was so jarring that it gave us all mild concussions. The wait for the hot air balloons and the Comet Express were 70+ minutes, so we skipped those. We knew we were visiting Tokyo Disneysea a few days later, so we felt we had all gotten our $20 worth and called it a day after 3 rides that took about 5 hours to complete.  So if this is the only amusement park you can get to, it's fine. But if you have other experiences, Lotte World is fine only if you can get a big discount and have teenagers you need to appease for a day.","Written June 10, 2016"

I will say that it is good for kids as there is a large indoor theme park for kids however its not as good as Universal Studios to begin with since I overheard some locals saying that LotteWorld is the same as Universal Studios. Haunted house needs to be improved! It was super dissapointing that many people were afraid to get into the haunted house but all we just did was to be seated down and watch a 'scary' animation movie which is not even scary to begin with. The department store is not even something I will recommend to go too. If you are coming from places like Singapore, Malaysia, US, Europe, its basically the same store as every other shopping mall. Muslim travellers, there is no halal food at all but there is side stalls that sells waffles and stuffs that you can eat. Overall LotteWorld is dissapointing.

But don't let this discourage you as the rides are worth the wait. An option to reduce your waiting time is download the lotte world app and after you buy your entry tickets, book your ride from the app. These people will get first preference to go for the rides. We came to know about this too late, so we couldn't avail this option.  Don't miss the gyro drop ride. It feels like you are having a free fall while sitting in a chair from 75 metres height.

1127,Daniel C,4.0,"Firstly pop on Google play store and download the app. This is essential as when u get your tickets you can scan them in and it gives you booking slots to reserve places using a sort of que jump system to get on some busy rides quicker. You get a limited number of these but that could save you an hour of queing when it gets busy.  If you're not Korean suggest take passports with you as we found a half price offer for foreigners so we got in 2 4 1 :-) You can buy day tickets easily at the ticket desks.  There's a mix of rides varying from rollercoasters to the very impressive Gyro Swing. Some of the rides you'd expect to be a bit worse aren't (the aladdin one, log flume, jungle ride, bungee) and some of the roller coasters are actually more severe (possibly being designed for smaller average height people they don't always have the best neck support for taller people?). Overall though nothing to complain about. We enjoyed ourselves throughly.  Didn't check re the ice skating if you have to book in advance (assuming so). Massive rink in the centre of the bottom floor.  Earlier in the day is much quieter than midday to evening. Use fast passes sparingly or later on when it gets busy.  Loads of little street food type stalls around that compares favourably to the uk on price for our theme park food plus lots of small restaurants on site.

1128,Bora M,5.0,"Lotte world is one of my favorite attractions in Korea. I would highly recommend this place if you want to make some great memories. It's a place for both children and adults. Try to reach lotte world as early as possible in the morning around its opening time. It would be less crowded then. Keep the information guide map handy all the time. It will help you a lot covering attractions more efficiently. As soon as we reached lotte world, we rushed to the roller coaster French Revolution which is on the 2nd floor. In the morning time the waiting queue is small. So, if you want to avoid long queues I would suggest you to grab the opportunity asap. I simply loved this indoor roller coaster ride. It was thrilling as well as super fun. Next, we made a clever strategy and decided to cover the attractions in top to down fashion starting from the 4th floor all the way down to the underland B1 floor. I think that helped a bit avoiding long queues and we could cover our desired attractions quickly. Don't forget to visit the Wild 4D shows wind, valley and jungle in underland B1 floor. It's a super amazing experience. The best among the all was wild wind. And you can skip the other two. After covering all the floors, we next moved on to the Magic land which is outdoor. It also has many thrilling outdoor rides. My favorite of all is Atlantis roller coaster. DO NOT miss this ride if you want to experience a real thrill. Waiting queue is too long but it's worth the wait. My next favorite in the magic land was comet express with rolling chairs. I came out laughing and it was pretty amazing. I truly dont feel that one day is enough to cover all the attractions in lotte world. As per the meals are concerned, we carried our own homemade food for lunch. There are also many and a great variety of restaurants out there. For vegetarians like me, there is a restaurant named ""Lake Pizza"" in the magic land which serves New York style pizza and its super yummy. Do plan a full day tour and avoid rainy days and weekends if possible. Also, avoid going in winter season as many outdoor rides are closed. Don't waste too much time clicking photographs as you might miss some super fun rides out there. Trust me, one day is just not enough. Good luck and have fun!!! :)","Written March 28, 2016"

The usual guidelines: go EARLY! and There's always a discount coupon available (that is, don't pay full price). Although it got quite crowded in the afternoon, the queues in the morning were reasonable when we went. We often got a bit lost, but eventually we found helpful directional signs. The stage shows had surprisingly well-trained (Russian?) dancers in absurd costumes and kiddie narration in Korean. The food and souvenirs were reasonably priced; and there were plenty of places to sit or stand and get your bearings. The ice rink at the bottom served as an orienting and comforting center to the place. In all, it is stunning to have such a space in the middle of a huge metropolis!

Love the ice skating ring, hot air balloon ride, parade, 4D ride, the charles chaplin performer, the pork cutlet cold buckwheat noodle at Mr Pork restaurant and carousel ride that have appeared in many Korean dramas.  I thought there maybe some areas that the theme park can improve. First, I think most tourists would agree with me the theme park needs a revamp. The rides are fun but they look old and they have served a decade of fun loving kids. Second, it's hard to find stairs and escalators that can lead us to the next floor. The map and direction weren't that useful. Third, rides narration and staff that gave safety instructions speak Korean, so we may have missed certain instructions or stories. It maybe good if they can add more English staff on ground or rides narration in English.

Yes, the waiting can get too long but it's no different than in any other popular amusement parks. It is expensive too but the variety of the rides and other games, the pretty views, the shows and the overall magical mood of the place totally makes up for it. There are many cheap restaurants and some souvenir shops inside. Also, if you go to their website, they usually have discounts, especially around holidays (Christmas, Halloween) and for foreigners, also, you can just buy the afternoon ticket.

Thought the chance to walk around for 17,000 won would make it worthwhile for my first visit, but this is a poor date location. Lotte World was mobbed with middle-school students in their school uniforms taking selfie pictures with every attraction in site. Lines were long even late in the evening, and the indoor section of the park closed down completely from 8:25-9:10 for a ""parade"", which was pretty lame.  Lotte World is pretty old and not that large, though conveniently located in the middle of Gangnam, so considering the value of the land it sits on the park is a reasonable size. The few rides we took (without the long lines) were quite basic... shooting some dragons, a 3D haunted-house movie, and a balloon IMAX movie that my girlfriend found entirely disappointing ... not the balloon simulation that she was expecting. Anything worth riding had a 20-30 minute queue, and just about every line was closed by around 9:30pm, so you just don't get to try anything with the late admission ticket.  For 2 adult visitors, Lotte World was very underwhelming. Avoid.","Written May 4, 2015"

Lotte World has an outdoor part which is sort of like a much smaller version of Disneyland, in California, and two indoor parts which has rides for younger kids. There is even a skating rink on the bottom floor. I rode the big kids rides in the outdoor part which has a castle modeled on the Sleeping Beauty Castle in Disneyland. If you have had enough of palace tours and want to eat cotton candy while looking for some fun, this is the place for some roller coaster type rides.

A major drawback is that the place only uses Korean in all of its rides and attractions.

1287,Leonine949,3.0,"Although the theme park is an old friend, and one I like to visit, this time I went next door to the newly completed mall (the tower is still under construction). This shopping mall has been plagued by many problems about construction and dealines, but is finally open to the public as of the middle of November 2014. Could some of the things I mention here be a part of the teething problems? Probably, and I hope they will be fixed before my next visit. First of all, I have to say that the architecture is splendid, along the lines of making all customers believe they have entered a treasure cave. Marble floors and pillars, gilded bannisters and trims, fairy lights - it all combines to turn the space into the inside of a glaring white disco ball. I longed for some muted colors and corners, someplace less white and gleaming and glaring, but maybe that's just my personal taste. What I can commend them on is adequate signage - everywhere you look are signs directing you to the subway lines, the movie theatres, the aquarium, the shops, the food courts etc. There are also plenty of automated info screens that you can use to search for a place - and in plenty of languages. Very tourist-friendly. But - no indications as to how far you'll have to walk, and believe me, you will have to walk quite a way. Also no indications about restrooms except one. Most of the shops were still unpacking and setting up, and those that were up and running had an eager air about them. I'm not sure what they are paying to rent space, but I'm sure it will be reflected in their prices. As for spaces where a person can just sire down for a moment and rest before tackling the rest, not in evidence! Unless you enter a restaurant you are not going to catch your breath unless you sit on the floor. If you have such a large space, you need to provide such an amenity. Is it worth a visit? Yes, possibly to visit the aquarium and the movie theatre. Will it have stuff you can't find anywhere else? Maybe, but it doesn't look like it at this stage.","Written November 22, 2014"

I went to Lotte World Adventure and it consist of four levels of indoor adventures and linked to an outdoor theme park called Magic Island. No doubt some of the rides were the main attractions there but the day went I visited was peak, and it was a Monday. They have two types of tickets, Daily Passport Ticket (full day and after 4pm admission) and Admission Only Ticket (full day, after 4pm and after 7pm admission). It gets cheaper for later passes, I advise you to purchase onsite to prevent any mistakes because it includes admission to some other parts like the museum, where I don't know where it that plus you might be give tourists discounts.  During March to April, they feature the Mask Festival where it's a world of fantastic masks along with the vibrant spirit of spring, plus a Masquerade parade at selected timings. The worse part of the trip was most of the rides had to stop at 8pm for fireworks for 30mins. That also means you'll be in the queue before 8pm and queue for 30mins + 1hour or whichever the waiting time for the ride. What frustrates me even more was the staff stopped me from entering and explained to me that there's fireworks but yet allowed Koreans to enter the queue, though there's communication barrier but actions spoke louder than words. That staff even screamed at me as he have to repeat multiple times that I have to wait after 830pm. Bad service!

Partly because he wanted to go because he loves amusement parks, but partly because he also wanted to show us the madness that is Lotte World. As I said, I wasn't sure what to expect, so the closest thing I can describe it to is Camp Snoopy/Nickelodeon World at the Mall of America in Bloomington, MN--except that Lotte World has both indoor and outdoor attractions, whereas CS/NW is purely indoors. The place was PACKED--I think we were there during a school break week--and the line for every ride was at least 3 hours long, so I didn't ride anything but instead just walked around (my dad and brother went on one ride while I sat and read a book, drank a soda, etc.). I can see how this would be entertaining for families/children who live in Seoul and this is as close to Disney as they can get. All of the rides and characters were blatant ripoffs of Disney characters/attractions, but that just added to the kitsch factor, so I was entertained by it all.  It was easy to find, easy to buy tickets, plenty of beverage/food options in the park. Just don't expect to be blown away if you have been to Disney Land/World already...it's not the same.

We didn't get to go on too many rides as waits were were up to 2 hours on some of them. The ones we did visit were great!

The quality of the ice rink is okay. The outer ring is heavily used and even after resurfacing, it still retains that bumpiness. The secondary ring, is smoother and nicer to skate on but all has a few bumps in it. We were not in the inner section so cannot tell its surface quality. The surface is quite a disappointment for skilled skaters. The ice is soft and wet after resurfacing. I think having a zamboni to resurface the ice would be remove the bumpiness but not the wetness.  The rink has many restrictive rules that are not clear on their website. Here are some examples.  - Children under the age of 6 are not permitted on the rink, not necessary true. What they really mean is children 120cm (3'11"") are not permitted on the ice at anytime. - Children ages 7 must be accompanied by an adult. They really mean a child age 7 must have an adult with them whether s/he is a beginner or skilled skater. The one child per adult is permitted, but 2 or more children with one adult is not permitted. - Hockey skates are not permitted at anytime. What they mean is they won't allow any hockey skates on the ice to keep the skating speed lower. So you can bring your own figure skates or speed skates to use along with gloves or mitts. If you don't have skates you can rent them there. The gloves and mitts is to ensure less bumps on the ice from beginners falling down and touching the ice. Children all have to wear a helmet which is free to use and are in two large bins in the changing area. If you forget to bring gloves or mitts, you can purchase some from the skate sharpening shop.  We will be searching for better rinks to try out next time.","Written November 10, 2013"

They also had tickets for general admission which are cheaper but doesn't allow you to ride the rides inside the theme park. We bought the ticket that allowed us to ride rides as we thought that it would grant us admission to all rides in the amusement park. But apparently that wasn't the case. We still had to pay extra 3000 won for quite a number of the attractions we wanted to visit. One example was their horror show. We ended up not going inside because we refused to pay the extra fee. Also, as a major tourist attraction in Seoul, I would have expected the place to be a little more tourist friendly. When my friend and I went to ride their 4D motion master, all the instructions given were in Korean and we had to follow what the others were doing before we know what we supposed to do.

Like nothing I have seen before. Worth every cent of the entry fee. My husband loved the museum. It was very interesting, and great for the adults to kill some time while the kids play. Although it is great for the kids too. I just loved seeing the kids having a ball. The ice rink in the centre of the ground floor was awesome, we watched loads of little kids getting their skating lessons. We got a suprise at night when the laser show started. We had no idea it was coming and there were pyrotechnics, a huge screen telling a story and massive flames around the centre, and of course we had no idea we were standing right next to one and got the fright of our lives. The outdoor part was fantastic. We went outside at night time, so some things were closed but still great. Live bands; the list just goes on and on. This place is fantastic and I highly recommend it. The variety of activities to do is endless. Let your inner child out and have a ball. We never made it to all the shops but they looked great. You can easily spend a whole day here.

Food wise, there were tons of places to buy churros, hot dogs, corn dogs, and other carnival style food. You also could get western, Korean, and Chinese food. Relative to the other places in Seoul, they were surprisingly inexpensive for being at an attraction. I paid about 7,000 KW for a pizza.

There are several rides that are geared towards the older crowed, but there are MANY rides and activities geared towards the little ones. Singing and dancing, walking characters etc.  This can easily be done in about 2-3 hours.  A place that few people visit is the folk museum in the back of the attraction, but it is really quite interesting and a fun way to work your way through Korean history in an abreviated version (plan for 45-90 minutes here depending on your interest in history).

1366,mcthfg,3.0,"Lotte World is a place where dreams go to die, and are reborn in mediocre rides and junk food. The lines are long, but the people-watching is fantastic. I kept expecting the indoor part of the park to start falling apart at any minute.  My wife and I were there for an entire day. Our first ride was Sinbad - a subtle and horrific hat-tip to Disney's ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" ride. It was fantastically awful, and when I was finally splashed by the water, I expected it to burn through my clothes. Our second attraction was an insect/rain forest mashup that featured lots of empty insect viewing cages and many children that perhaps should have been in some of those cages. Then we ventured outdoors, for the real fun...  ...Of waiting in line for 2 hours for ""Atlantis."" Actually a pretty good roller coaster - the ride consists of going in and out of a man-made mountain, and has two main runs. Again, not bad. However, the other rides (all 8 or so of them) all had very long lines, and we were getting cold, so we ventured back inside.  Our finale consisted of a tea-cup inspired ride that had a large cobra in the middle, and revolved just quick enough to entice the junk food our of your stomach. Not bad, but perhaps a ride to be taken earlier in the day, before food consumption.  Many of the indoor attractions and rides cost a little extra.  This is a genuine piece of Korea, and while many foreigners might scoff at the rides and general condition of the place, the people-watching is superb.","Written February 21, 2013"

Most rides which we wanted to go for like 4D theater and Bumper Car were all closed for maintenance. We queued 30 minutes for the monorail only to realise that it circles the indoor area only, not the indoor and outdoor area as we expected. The hotair balloon ride queue was so long that it says 60 minutes wait so we did not attempt to queue for it.  We wanted fast food fried chicken for dinner and were told that we had to wait for 30 minutes for the chicken to be ready.  Maybe because it was a Sunday night, it was way too crowded, long queues for minimal attractions that were open indoor and long queues for food.

Food are easily available around, though I hope that there are a greater variety for fast food. This is very important because of the terrible queues that plague every theme park.

That's why even if you go in after 4pm or 7pm, you will still have plenty of time to enjoy the amusement rides and attractions.  Lotte World amusement park has many fun rides, even for the young ones. We went on a Friday and did not have to queue long to go on the kiddy rides {esp in Level 1}. The popular adult rides, however, were packed with youngsters and I saw some waiting time as long as 2hrs!! o.O There are some very exciting rides like Atlantic Adventure {roller coaster}, Gyro Drop {high tower drop ride}, Flume Ride {water plunge ride} and Waikiki Wave {twisting, swinging-in-the-air ride}.  Throughout the year, Lotte World celebrates different festival and when we went they were celebrating Halloween so there were many decorations, picture booths, performances and characters dressed in Halloween costumes. By the way, I think 2 rides you shouldn't miss out on are the World Monorail, which goes around the entire amusement park {indoors and outdoors}, and the Aeronauts Balloon Ride {indoors}. Both rides give you the most beautiful scenic sky view of Lotte World.  More posts on our Korean trip here: http://www.sakuraharuka.com/search/label/korea","Written April 3, 2012"
1396,minah86,4.0,"Try the Hot air balloon ride for full view of the park. The indoor and outdoor games were soooo scary! (the 360 degree roller-coaster,giant drop etc.) ;-). The entrance fee will be much cheaper after 4 pm and you'll get discount if you show your travel passport/visa.","Written April 2, 2012"
1397,outlaw1865,4.0,"The potential for a great day is definetly there as long as you wisely choose when to go, Korea is a small country with a huge population so land is not abundant and also at a very large premium compaired to other countrys so places are just smaller and more compact then westerners are used to.  As a result this place can get seriously crowded making a 1-2 hr wait for the rides more the norm rather than the exception. To greatly enhance your experience go during the week and go early in the day before the crowds build up and the lines get long (Tip*** A common trait among Korean people is that they DO NOT like to get up early when not working so use this to your advantage***)  The park is in two parts, they have an outside section and an inside section, Although the park is open year round, Seoul can get bitterly cold during the winter months so it is of course much more enjoyable during mild weather as some of the best rides are located outside.  Admission is relatively inexpencive at 24,000 Won for adults (Aprox $22 USD) and you can often cut that price in half as many half price coupons are available on the various forigen travel sites, as well as area hotels, and local english magazines and newspaper publications you just have to look....","Written March 29, 2012"
1398,lanesend332,4.0,"Had a spare afternoon on a chilly Seoul afternoon, so my girlfriend and I checked out Lotte World and had a ball. I didn't know what to expect from the place (thought it would be a cheap Disneyland knock off), but had a great time on the indoor roller coaster and other indoor rides (flume ride, adventure rides) as well as the big rides out on the island.  So if you do have a spare 5 hours and are in the mood for some good old fashioned amusement park fun, Lotte world is worth a look.","Written March 14, 2012"
1399,TravelbugsPPt,5.0,"Despite the odd over-greetings from the staffs, the place is fun and the indoor area is huge. The end of the day light show is awesome. You must try The Atlantis Adventure, Comet Express and French Revolution. We had so much fun we went on to them 3 times! Be prepare to stay the full day to enjoy it, we were exhausted at the end of the day (almost 11pm when we walk out) but it was fun fun fun!","Written March 12, 2012"

1401,Anne_Eisenberg,5.0,"OK, this may sound a bit childish, but this is actually one of favorite places in Seoul. This place is hilarious. It makes you feel as if you've gone back to your childhood. Here are the tips and what I think about this place in general:  1. Make sure you visit during the parade time. Beautiful people in fancy costumes will parade in the tune of cheerful music and that is quite something to see.  2. If you enjoy skating, there is a ice skating rink in the middle.  3. The foods and beverages sold inside are of OK quality, and are reasonably priced. If you opt for better food, you would have to go out (but still inside the building and right outside the indoor entrance) and look for ""Spaghettia"" -- my favorite past franchise.  4. Lotte World is connected to Sukchon Lake where you can take a walk, Lotte Dept Store, Lotte Hotel, Lotte Mart and Lotte Cinema. There are also a big Apple Computer Shop and ToysAreUs, which add fun.  Enjoy!","Written February 22, 2012"

1403,spaice.exploration,4.0,"Lots of fun in a compact venue with some great rides. In winter you are limited to the inside which is a shame because all the fun is outside. There are some great rides that are all very close together, and queues are manageable! You can also get reservations to come back at a set time and save yourself from a long wait in exchange for a short one (still maybe 10/15 minutes). Lots of fun for all ages!","Written February 6, 2012"
1404,Starr L,3.0,It went over the weekend and it was fun. The rides are fun but don't go in with big expectations because you will be disappointment. I was able to be entertained the whole day but one visit is definitely enough. Cool ice-skating rink inside.,"Written January 9, 2012"
1405,veggiejeonju,4.0,Lotte World gets very crowded in the afternoon after school gets out and on the weekend. It's best to go early in the morning. It isn't that impressive compared to amusement parks in the other countries but it is ok for a few hours. If you have more time go to Everland which about an hour outside of Seoul but even that can't compare to amusement parks in other countries.,"Written January 6, 2012"
1406,violetcraze,4.0,"The folk village was closed when we got there (around 7pm), so my advice is to visit the folk village first before going to other attractions. The rides were fun, but not extremely special. Our favorite one was the Atlantis, which was a pretty special roller coaster. It was winter and VERY cold, so be prepared. Overall the rides were pretty good, but not special enough to make a trip there if you don't have too much time in Seoul.","Written January 4, 2012"
1407,Kallang,5.0,Glad that part of amusement park was indoors as it was minus 5 outside. Many rides for young kids. The indoor playground with the air guns was a highlight.

I have one kid who refused to take any thrilling rides n another who r dying for all the thrilling rides. So we have to split into 2 gps n we thoroughly enjoyed the park. I like the monotrail which lead you from the indoor to th eoutdoor themepark. this offers u a gd overall view when u do not want to step out in the cold. additional, the staff at the entrance was very helpful to tourist. Our hotel rm was only reday at 1pm and we enter the park at abt 11am. They made some arrangement for us so that we could re enter the park with ease. It was so fun that we only leave the park at 4pm and chk in our hotel rm then. we came back in the evening again to continue teh rides. additionally, u can get discounted ticket if u stay at lotte world hotel.","Written November 22, 2011"
