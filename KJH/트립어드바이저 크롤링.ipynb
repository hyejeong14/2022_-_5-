We visited because we needed something to do during a rainy day. So we went to the aquarium and walked around the mall. Lots of great places to eat that are very affordable.  We did not go to the tower since it was rainy and the view was not great. On a sunny day though, I'm sure it would be a great place to see.\", 'Don’t bother going.  The view? Spectacular.  The elevator ride? Quite fun.  The rest? AWFUL.  It’s 90 degrees and they can’t even bother to turn on the AC properly? At more than $20 (27,000 won) per ticket, you’d think they’d at least provide that basic level of a service. Even though we went in the evening, it was so crowded without proper ventilation I felt dizzy.  The local 7-11 has better AC than this.  If you’re traveling with children or the elderly, seriously reconsider. Go to N Tower instead. This place is way overrated.', 'Magnificent views across Seoul. Currently, still being influenced by Covid, there were no waiting times at all. Elevators bring you in lightning speed to the 119th(?) floor. From there a video show starts and ends after ~1 minute with a breathtaking view over Seoul. Afterwards you can stroll around freely on all 5 levels above, including a small cafe with reasonably priced coffee and other drinks. Even a small shop with gifts / souvenirs is available, if you are into those kind of things.', 'seoul Lote Tower its amazing Tower. its smart tower. theres meny restaurants and caffe shops. really its amazing place for visit. i hope everyone will visit that place.', 'Favorite part of the experience was to go up to the 122nd floor and look around and also to have a cup of (normally priced) coffee. The view is beyond spectacular.', \"Huge mall like you normally expect in Asia and the Middle East with loads going on. Very clean and well kept. So tall! Go to Seoul Sky observation deck located in here. Views are stunning. The mall has mainly designer clothing on the upper levels. These floors were quite quiet. Lower down is busier with more affordable shops and various eateries. Wifi is painfully slow. There is a cinema and other forms of entertainment. Walk to the really 'cute' eating area (there are loads). I managed to find this one on the entrance level coming out of the Subway (at the back). Air conditioning is thankfully not too cold. If you want a break in between sightseeing and to get out of the heat, then this is worth a stop.\", 'Amazing shopping mall with great value buys, make sure to collect your GST claims before leaving the mall. I got 5 packs of sock, Superdry T-shirts, a wonderful looking umbrella woven with korean silk and a nice japanese restaurant at the basement.', \"We went here last Saturday. There are lots of people because it's Saturday. Everything goes well. The view is spectacular.  Highly recommended.\", 'You can spend a lot of time at this location, shopping, eating and taking in the view from the top of the tower.', 'The Mall itself is huge and impressive, therefore i´d give 4 stars. Together with the tower actually only 2 stars. Even you buy the ticket in advance there are long waiting cues (over 1,5 hours). Then on top there are just some small cafes (nothing special) and souvenir shops. The view is nice but really not outstanding. Only good thing there is the short elevator drive and enjoying a cocktail on top.', 'Its the highest building in Korea and has a very big shopping mall. Near to it there is a park with a lake in it, you can visit both and its not bad.', 'You can get everything. It is of course very crowded. Interesting. Some stores are really nice and cute. The metro station is at the basement. The building is actually gorgeous from outside. It is one of the tallest buildings in the world and the tallest in Korea. The Signiel hotel is in the top floors. We stayed at the hotel. The hotel is phenomenal.', \"I wasn't overly impressed with this building. I went to a function there. There was nothing special about anything here. The view is nice. I wouldn't avoid it, but don't go out of your way to visit.\", 'the highest tower in Korea, you can see Seoul from the top. it really deserve a visit.  however, consider the queue on the elevator to the top floor. I suggest that you just go after opening time in the early morning so you can avoid the waiting time.  I really liked the gift shop on the top floor.', \"The mall is connected to the metro station so it's quite convenient to reach. We went on the new year eve for the countdown fireworks but it was smaller scale and not as amazing as compared to the one in 2019. Seems to have a great mix of shopping and food options would consider to come back explore again.\", 'This 7 story shopping mall has great restaurants and activities including a large movie theater with a 4D screen.', 'I went into this shopping mall and its nice and expensive, there are some nice restaurants below. I went to the very top and the views are very nice although for me somehow it was a little confusing to get done and the staff kept pointing me in the wrong level, so I am writing this and not from the top of the tower so obviously made it done.', 'We visited the Lotte Tower as it was not far from The Westin where we were staying. There was a constant stream of people going in and out so we were intrigued. The entire place is full of designer shops, as well as the surrounding area. We compared prices and they were similar to what you would pay in Australia. Overall it was a bit of a letdown but interesting to see. Not a great selection for Men.', 'for not being the tallest in the world & still having infrastructural issues during its construction; not even guaranteeing the view that would compensate for most of the price, i\\'d say this thing is overrated; even when you get to the top, some of the things are extra.. . \"buyer-beware\"..', 'The night view was average. There were probably too many people.  It was like queuing for an amusement ride. Went through two rooms before getting on the elevator. Bring a paper fan with you.  There were two small balconies for viewing outdoor. The logistics needs improvement - people going in and put were mixed together in a small glass room.', 'What an amazing experience and we had so much fun! The food, the stalls and the view, all perfect! You will find almost anything and everything there', 'I enjoyed this park even though I went on a day when a tropical storm was passing through. The entertainment was good, the food reasonable. Some rides had some really long lines like The French Revolution (3 hours cue). Some rides I could not ride because of the restraints being to small for my large frame. but most I could ride.', 'I enjoyed the view of Seoul, but given the sometimes foggy/smoggy local air you need to pick a good day to visit.  I was struck by how similar the observation decks of really tall buildings are. If you have been to the Empire State Building or Sears tower then your experience will be very similar here, but it will be a different view.', 'Incredible views, no doubt. However, zero information about the building. A 2 hour wait in a boiling, non air conditioned room will suck the excitement out of the activity. Nothing to do upstairs and the terrace is totally closed off so it’s not any more interesting than looking from the window.', 'Very disappointing. More like a children’s amusement park than a serious attraction. No interesting information about the buildings construction or engineering just toys, sweet shops and cartoon photos for the kids who were far too young to appreciate the wonders of such a magnificent building. The management should go to Taipei 101 or Petronas Towers to see how it should be done.', 'The Lotte World Tower is an astounding architectural achievement! Standing on a glass floor at 119 stories above the ground is scary as heck! It was incredible looking down on 30 story buildings that looked like toys. We were there on a clear day and the views stretched off forever. The elevator ride from ground to 119 in just under 60 seconds was pretty incredible. The tickets are not cheap but worth the price in my opinion!', 'Took the world’s first 60secs to level 118! The feeling was well, nothing much. Just abit if ears stuck. The technology in the lift is also awesome. Super high up the tower, could see the overall of Seoul. It’s beautiful', 'This mall is worth visiting. The stores and restaurants are great. Go up the escalator to the theatre and go out to the deck outside. You look over the city and there are fun things up there!', 'The Mall is typical with boutique and restaurants with reasonable prices.  Had visited the Lotte World Adventure with our DISCOVER Seoul Pass. Rode the Bungee which was so nerve wrecking! Their”Across the Dark” is not as hi-tech and thrilling as Macau’s Batman Dark Flight. They should improve their VR.  Kiddy ride were a lot.', 'We were very excited to visit Lotte World and Lotte Mall, we got Lotte world tickets before they open to void the long lines and it worked, we were able to go to different rides without waiting for long time, definitely it is a great place to visit with kids. Lotte Mall, was the most beautiful place I ever visit!!', 'Lotte Tower provides a great view of the city. The flashing lights all around the city and bridge makes it a must see at night!', 'Excellent views of the old Seoul and the new Seoul. Seeing the many bridges from the 123rd floor was great. The glass floor looking down on the street below was mind blowing.', \"easy to arrive with local public transportation. plan your visit, eve if you olny want to see the view, try to visit the play area and walk arround ' worth the time\", 'I am puzzled by the review I just read. I thought this was a great observation deck, and they spoke English very well. They answered all of my questions. And most observation decks I have been to have very few elevators. And some sort of wait. It took all of 10 minutes to get to the top for us, and it started out with a bang. The digital wall reveal is amazing. The outside deck was scary fun. All of the electronic assists, in letting you know what you are looking at was great tech  A bit on the pricier side, but still cheaper than The Empire State Building or 30 Rock.', '1. the mall is like any big mall in Korea, nothing special I think  2. my review is about the tower: positive: - outstanding View from the 117th to 121th floor, about 500m -> for that 1 point  negative: - expensive, adult 26000 Won per person - it took more than 70 min to get upstairs, all the procedures like security scan, taking photos to sell them later, just endless waiting in several rooms without a window, the air condition was turned on in stand by modus, there was just simply not enough refreshing cool air coming out of the aircon, nobody of the staff cared, you just were pushed through all the rooms like a herd of sheep There were no information about the waiting time. If i had knew that then i would have paid the fast check in ticket which costs 50000 Won.This is outrageous expensive but in retrospect worth it. Of course first of all you must afford this price. Everyone who is able to do it should do it because when you stand in the queue for about 50 min and you see the fast tracker who paid more because they „knew“ and they are passing through the middle line to the elevator then the damn legs are hurting even more and you are still not in the elevator. Because they skip the queue, the waiting people have to wait longer, maybe your spot in the elevator was taken by one of the high payers. - show room was closed - the outside terrace was closed - the service and the staff processes have to optimize a lot I think - started at the end of the queue at 16.30, to see the Sunset. We arrived round about 17.45 in the 118th floor. Then it was dark night. The windows are reflecting the inside light so the pictures you make are always with co-displayed with people around you - downstairs same procedure: another QUEUE, the second one. A little bit faster downstairs, round about 45min, but still too much time lost. The sightviewing floors are big enough, there was no hustle, so the main problem was the ONE and ONLY elevator (of obviously 2) which was opened for the mass of visitors. - the 2 walk with bottom glas view are not that impressive because you know you are standing on glas, all the floor glasses are full of scratches - in the queue: NO SITTING  Conclusion: Lack of process optimization. Great view but just go there when you have enough time and air in your lungs or enough money in your pocket to buy you a fast lane ticket! Go there early enough to see the city by daylight and take some pictures without reflecting of the night indoor lights. Prepare it to the Eiffel Tower in Paris it isnt that irritating like in Lotte Tower or the Empire State Building in N.Y., there are timeslots there and you can buy the tickets simply online, in english! My opinion!  To the operators: this stay (2019) in Seoul we decided to stay at Park Hyatt Hotel but we had also considered the Signiel Hotel. The best view was the most important factor in this years hotel choice. Next year, i do travel to Korea once a year because of my family, it won’t be the Signiel again. For sure!', 'Standing on a glass floor on one of the tallest buildings in the WORLD was a tad scary but so worth it. Views of the city and surrounding hills were grand while the sun was setting.', \"I can rave on all I like about being 123 stories and 480 odd metres in the air but unless you go up you won't ever appreciate just how cool the vies of the nightlights and the view of the Han River are.\", 'If you visit with your Discover Seoul Pass you will get a small discount going up the tower, but price is not unusual for any other attraction such as this in other parts of the world. We paid EUR 19 per person and it was far more entertaining with the laser light show and the LCD display screens. Once you get up to the top via the elevator you can go higher up using the escalators as there are 3 more viewing floors. Coffee shop and sweet shop available. Sadly the air quality was not good when we went so visibility was not optimal, very hazy. The mall itself was fun with lots to see and play with. Fancy shops and I did not feel bored.', 'I went there at night - seeing Seoul late at night was a nice experience. The glass floor in the two spots give you some thrills but its a nice sensation! Definitely go!', 'Accessed from inside the train station this is a really great Tower experience. Out of the 4 we experienced in South Korea this was easily the best. A couple of staged photo shots then up in the super fast elevator. Once at the viewing level you soon realise there are escalators taking you higher and to various shops and cafes etc. Glass floor part is cool and all in all it was really good.', 'You need at least one day to leisurely walk around each of the buildings and look at the shops and the amusement park. Gangnam is an impressive area ..WOW!', 'The entrance ticket was a bit expensive but overall the experience of the visit was really pleasant. We went during the nighttime which was nice to see the overview of Seoul with the street lights, but I think for a better experience it would be best to go during the daytime.', 'Probably one of the best 360 degree view of a city you can find anywhere in the globe. Incredible scenes. You are on the top of the 6th tallest building on Earth, as well as the worlds fastest double decker lift to get that high. Incredibly can also see the vastness of Seoul and planes landing nearby, well worth it. Can also access open air sections to view from, and a glass floor section. You just love to see it.', 'One of the best tours I’ve been on. The views are spectacular from every angle. Our tour guide allotted 2 hours for pictures plus he planned the trip at sunset. Amazing place, a must see.', 'One of the best tallest buildings I have visited. Very, very modern (opened in 2017), beautiful architecture, very high observation deck (478m), including a nice glass floor section, great views to all Seoul.', 'Nice, large complex containing a hotel, mall and amusement park. There are many things to see and do and you can spend a whole day going inside it without going out.', 'This is a very beautiful building from the outside. You can then take the ride up to the top for about $25 each. Give yourself at least an hour and preferably two hours. It was not very busy when we visited but there are multiple queues that take at least 30 - 40 minutes to get to the elevators even on a slow period. You can book ahead online to insure faster entrance. The views are awesome and there is a glass floor. This is a must do.', \"The Lotte Tower is an amazing place to visit and must be on your list of things to do in Seoul. It's a little pricey for admission but well worth it. A quick trip up an elevator with a 3D show to the observation deck at 500m reveals great views of Seoul. Best on a clear day.  There are several areas with glass floors with a view straight down the side of the tower. Not for the fainthearted with heights! Be prepared for the usual push and shove of people getting pictures of themselves standing on the viewing platform.\", \"The Lotte World Tower is home to the Super Plex G, the world's largest movie theater screen according to Guinness Book of World Records. A friend and I saw Infinity War in it and it was worth. Just make sure to arrive early for good seating among the nearly 700 seats.\", 'You will see amazing views from the tower, the elevator is very quick and theirs a museum that you can walk around before you head up to the top. Wow is all I can say', 'Never se so many people trying to by so meny things in the last floorrs of this big building, you need your pasport, and by the way is cheaper in the states', \"Despite the price tag, the views from the tower are impressive and it's worth going up. Especially on a clear day you can see a lot.\", 'I usually find towers touristy and a bit tedious but this was really something! The height is incredible, we were actually higher than planes flying in. There are small cafes inside the tower and a shop to send a postcard that gets posted one year later.  Recommend eating at the Lotte mall first as you get a decent discount with receipts from purchases on the day of the visit.', \"Visiting this building is a mind-blowing experience. It's ~500 metres tall in the other side of the city. It's really tall! Once you enter the lift (elevator), it takes just 20-30 sec to reach the top. Then the view is simply breath-taking!! It's difficult to capture the whole of Seoul in the camera but one will leave with the memory that is hard to forget. Enthralling view! must visit. The entrance fee is slightly pricey but worth it.\", 'We bought our tickets on the app Klook and it was about $50 a person for the amazing combo deal for Lotte World, Lotte Tower and Lotte Aquarium! We noticed that for Lotte World and Lotte Tower alone the tickets for those single attractions were close to $45. We filled an entire day with these Lotte attractions and had so much fun! The Lotte World Tower was a highlight of our trip! We ate at the 123 Lounge on the 123rd floor, it was a little pricey but what you would expect for a high end bar/restaurant with a view like that! Lotte World was almost like a smaller disney with the restaurants, rides, indoor ice rink and gift shops. I can imagine this would be a great place for kids, but even as two adults we had a blast! We went on a Saturday so it was very crowded, I would suggest going on a school day because we saw one of the lines for a ride reached a 2 hour wait with a line that wrapped around the Magic Island zone. Other than that it was a pretty great experience!', 'Amazing place, very fast lifts.. half a KM in the sky, what views. The restaurant was amazing too. Definitely the best site to see in Seoul.', \"While on a mixed business / family trip to Seoul earlier this year, we went to the Lotte World Tower because it seemed to be the area in Seoul with the earliest cherry blossoms. Sorry, this review is obviously a little late because this annual event obviously takes place in April but better late than never. So if you happen to be in Seoul and the cherry blossom season is just starting (usually early April) this would be the place to go to, in particular the 2 small lakes just to the South of the Lotte WT&M. It's lovely and full with people taking pictures and I would imagine it will be quite nice during the rest of year also. The shopping mall itself is amazingly large, there's everything but like with lots of these big malls, it's full of branded shops which tend to be more expensive. So this is probably not the place to come for local, cheap goodies. But worthwhile if you like shopping. There are plenty of restaurants and a lot of them look very tempting. Lots of different foods but the one that caught our eye was a very small local Korean restaurant which seemed to be only frequented by staff working in the World Tower and Mall. It was very cheap with very tasty food, the surroundings matched the price, very simple and very few decorations but if you want to fill up your stomach without spending an awful lot of time in a restaurant, then go to MyeongDong Halmoni Kalguksu (명동할머니국수), which you can find in the Seoul Seoul 3080 restaurant area on the 6F. I tried to find this restaurant for review separately but it's not yet listed on TripAdvisor, hence I'll mention it here. I'd go definitely go there again for the quality of the food at rock bottom prices. The Tower itself is massively tall and quite pretty. We didn't go to the top, mainly because we had no time and it's also quite expensive, compared to going up Seoul Tower in the city centre (separate review). Certainly an area of Seoul which you should put on your list when visiting.\", 'We were very surprised with our visit to Lotte Tower. It felt like a Disney Ride rather than an observation point. It was very well done with the modern technology available. We actually elevated faster than falling to thee earth without feeling anything but your ears popping. Also, who can resist having a cocktail at the highest bar in the world.', 'Shopping heavens. Just about anything you want. Best of all, instant refund with your purchase. All you need is your passport. There are also many restaurants cater to your taste. We spent at least couple of hours here. Fantastic.', 'If you are into shopping, it is a place where you must not miss .. take your passport with you to get the tax refund instantly or some of the shop will have your goods ready for collection at the airport on your departure date. This is all on the 11th floor “The Duty Free” floor. Very convenience and you have many options. Next to it, you just walk across to the Lotte Department Store, another amazing place.', 'We love malls with easy transport access, range of shops which suit different pockets, large variety of restaurants/cafes for refuel and supermarket. Lotte World Mall hits all the right buttons. We spent half a day here and the supermarket was very well-stocked. There is also a floor of specially curated local restaurants which are famous in their regions for specific food. It was a great day for our group.', 'It’s a nice shopping mall. I didn’t go up the tower because in my opinion it was too expensive, I think it was like $27.', 'Just for the experience of stepping on a glass floor 120 floors above ground, wow! The views all around are amazing!', 'Very large modern mall that is compromised by the towers above it. Has all the big brands but has a bit of an odd layout', 'Great place for those who love shopping. Lots of shops and lovely cafes. Prices are different, a lot of sales. Losing track of time!', 'I was in Seoul for business and we were invited by Lotte to tour the tower complex. We went through a compelling video on the building of the tower and models of the site. Then we took an exciting elevator ride to Level 117 and viewed the gronud from the glass bottomed viewing platform. Finally, we went through all the floors ending on the restaurant on Level 123. There are cafes and other amenities for families and the view is spectacular and well worth a visit', \"There are SO many things you can do here: 1. Shopping until your wallet runs dry. Its a perfect place to escape from the run or cold weather. 2. Eat your heart out. Can't remember which floor it was but there is a food section within this mall where they had brought all the famous restaurants into one area. There are many selection of food ranging from snacks, full meal to desserts. Anything you want to eat they will have it. 3. Enjoy Seoul's city view from the tower. It's now the tallest building in Seoul. 4. Amusement Park. Lotte World is just right around the corner for those who wants to experience Korean theme park.  And of course many more\", 'The mall was really large and they offered things in a good price. The tower had a great view and I personally think it was better than the Petronas or Taipei.', 'A fantastic complex if you like high end shops. The cost of going up the tower was in our opinion over priced.', 'Excellent place to visit if you want to spend the day shopping and sightseeing. Don’t miss the Library inside, perfect for Instagram pics. We didn’t go up to the Tower but heard the view is amazing.', 'This is one of the biggest malls I’ve been into. Maybe even a 2 day or all day event. There is an aquarium, stores (divided by male/female/children).  A food court area, there are designated seating areas depending on where you purchased food from. But definitely not enough seats. We stood with our two small children staring until someone got up.  There is a huge tech store. Similar to a Best Buy.  We initially went here to see the Studio Ghibli store. Which was pretty small, but still super cute. And we will return to buy some more Ghibli souvenirs.  This malls also has an individual Vans store. Which is nice. Because you can usually only buy those shoes at ABC mart here.', 'Great view around the lake nearby lotte tower. The nearest toilets can be found on nearby restaurants. Best view at the park on left side of lotte world facing lotte world from this picture. Use naver to navigate when commuting. There are mopeds, scooters and bikes thru applications too if you want to go biking, it is located near bus stations, 500₩ / hr use. You must install app first e.g.mobike', \"A very cool 555m tall skyscraper in Gangnam right next to Lotte World amusement park. The admission ticket was about 22.000 Won. Not too bad as we a free photo for every 4 ticket purchased. It's still a relatively new building. The superfast lift is lined with LCD screens that light up as we go up. Very cool and took less than a minute to the 118th floor. Once there go to the glass floor area and look down. What a great experience. Go to the 120 Floor to check out the outdoor area. You can see the whole of Seoul from up here. A great experience for the family.\", 'Very crowded. You got to go thru a long line for any rides. All day pass is pricey but can’t ride enough due to long lines everywhere. You might want to pay more to get an express ticket to avoid lining.', \"Room (88th floor) was well appointed with the expected amenities and very quiet with a great view of the city. Even the clouds couldn't dampen the mood. The staff were very kind and always super polite. There were no hiccups with the reservation, parking, or dining. The aquarium was nice for kids and the nearby shopping had all the top brands and the latest K-Pop paraphernalia. I had high expectations and they were met.\", 'Huge Mall. Shopping, Food, Entertainment, Lotte World Adventure. Many restrooms/toilets. There is Park outside with a small lake (man-made?) where we stayed for an hour to relax. Accessible by subway train.', \"It's a luxury mall. Not the best mall. Personally, Singapore has better malls. It's just super hyped. You can skip it if you are a budget traveler\", 'You’re probably here for the tower, it’s the 8th tallest in the world and offers some incredible views of what I consider to be a beautiful city. We didn’t spend much time in the mall, only making our way to and from the tower, but it seemed a shoppers paradise! The tower itself is incredible! Well designed and a good experience for patrons, we had a seat at the bar over looking the 1988 Olympic site. Drinks were expensive, but we were on top of the city so we didn’t mind. Coming down from the tower we managed to get lost going to the duty free area. It was somewhat difficult to get back to the regular mall as the lifts didn’t indicate which building you were in!', \"We went to find a specific store, Beanpole, and we bought some outfits there. It's very expensive. Customer service is unbeatable. So many people just waiting to help you can be a bit overwhelming sometimes but it was very nice.\", 'The Lotte Tower is the 8th tallest building in the world at 486m and 125 stories. (For comparison the Burj Khalifa is 228 stories--almost twice as tall!) The elevator to the top rises 118 floors in one minute. The views are great! I would shoot for off-season and I like the views best at night. This is one of those places that easily gets jammed with tourists at the wrong time. The observation deck has a glass floor and just a net over the top to catch things falling from above. (What can fall from above at this height?) It would also be tremendous to see a fireworks display from up here. New Years Eve must be wild!', 'Being the 5th tallest building in the world this is well worth a visit. At the top of the Tower there is a glass floor allowing you to see all the way down. Bit pricey but worth it.', 'I intended to visit just the tower but there was so much to do I came back for a second day. The Tower has great views and you can eat on one of the levels as well. Just don’t skip anything on a level as I couldn’t figure out how to go back down just a level only all the way down to the 1st floor Little world amusement park was wonderful had the best roller coasters on the outside and plenty of smaller rides all around The Lotte Museum was great too spent half a day inside there and they let you take pictures and have other interactive items They have a KPOP experience as well it was nice just not to big they could make that much better Then the mall has tons of high end brands to everyday items You can easily spend 2 whole days here to see everything', 'Next and connected to Siegniel and the Siegniel Hotel, the highest building and the highest hotel in Seoul. A huge shopping mall that also near to the theme park, suitable for families with kids. Very crowded on weekends.', \"Great shopping mall overall! Lotte is one of the hallmark shopping malls/supermarkets in Korea. They have some of the most interesting shops and supermarkets there! I liked the video game shop a lot. But they don't have all those video games that you might think in North America. But the world tower is beautiful and bright! Will return there one day. It's pretty close to the Seoul Railway Station in which you will meet beggars around the underground.\", 'I was in Lotte World Tower for a movie premier. The place is conveniently located next to the train station, so had no problem to reach. It is huge and hosts many stores.', 'A stunning building, really worth visiting it! The 5th highest building in the world till now! Keep in mind that great view will be experienced only during good visibility!', 'It was really beautiful inside. Lots of duty free shops for cosmetics (worth a visit) and cheaper than the regular market. went on top to the sky deck as well, beautiful city views', 'Lotte World mall has an awesome creative design, how i wonder is the design per zone ...beautiful...elegant ...perfect! The upper class product is available here such as hermes, burberry, etc.', 'more than 100 stories tall building ideal for seoul night scenery hunting individual and families to catch a chill drink on top', 'Go during the day there is less people..we waited in no line. Went to the very top--where there is a bar. Go out onto balcony...great visit--went to mall for dinner', \"We took our grandkids to Lotte World and couldn't believe how special this was...it is literally a mini-Disneyland within the mall. Terrific (some scary) rides and plenty of options for many age groups. Everything is run efficiently and there are plenty of food options for all.\", 'From my point of view this was one the most amazing views I’ve ever seen in my life, it’s an amazing experience descending more than 500mts into the fastest elevator over the earth.', 'On a clear day you can see everything, because it is the only high building near and far. Finished 2 years ago it is the ultimate land mark. A modern elevator brings you up quickly, then you have various viewing platforms, also glass floor to look all the way down. You better love hights!', 'This wonderful place to shop or spend your evening strolling around at the lake just outside the mall. Blessed with good weather and cherry blossom last week. To get here was easy with the subway.', \"At $27 per person it was a pretty costly trip atop the world's 5th tallest structure but worth it for the night view. Went up just before it turned dark so got a view of the city in the daylight but it's the night time when the city really shines. Photos are tricky during the day because the external water stains are awful and at night there's the light reflecting off the glass in some places but with 360 viewing you're bound to capture a few great shots. Note there is an airport type security check before heading into the elevators. I didn't have anything of note but not sure what you'd do if you have something not allowed up. Inside the elevator the ceiling and walls light up with an amazing show as if you're flying into space. On the ride down there is a fireworks show on the ceiling and walls. Unbelievably fast ride considering the trip up 120+ floors. Don t go if you're claustrophobic, people are crammed in, but very short trip - felt like 30 seconds - so not too bad.\", 'try to enter lotte world tower and go up to 117th floor and up to 121st floor great amazing views all around seoul can see gangman area and olympic park from here', 'To travel with the speed of light in an elevator to the 124th floor of the tower was an amazing experience. World class!!', 'Lotte tower, The 5th tallest building in the world. Amazing feeling when you get on top with scenic view of Seoul. there is also a big shopping mall in the building with a lot of shops and food choices.', 'Amazing view and scenery from the top of the tower where you can enjoy spectacular view of seoul.similarly you can enjoy the shopping in mall where you can buy alot of branded items.and yes dont forget to take pictures', 'This time my kids stuck me in a wheelchair, dicky knees from arthritis. It was a free wheelchair hire. Everything was easily accessible. It was incredibly busy though, The average wait time for a ride was 180 mins!!!! It was a special day though, if you dressed in a school uniform then you got in half price. So, uniforms everywhere. Staff were great though and I went on a few rides. Sometimes even managed to cut a line with my helper. There were still steps to climb though, which the staff were happy to help me with. Beautiful at night due to the lights. A nice way to spend an afternoon evening.', \"We visited the Lotte World Tower in February, only visiting the Mall as a means of accessing the Tower.  Quite a pricey visit, although we were pleasantly surprised to receive a discount for using a Mastercard to pay for our tickets, which then worked out at 48000 KrWon for two of us. There are a number of corridors to walk through, with images screened on the walls, before you arrive at the elevator - a double decker and very fast. You also have the opportunity to have a photo taken with a chosen image on a green screen behind you, a similar opportunity is in place at the top of the tower, but there is no pressure to take part.  It was all relatively quiet at this time of year but the length of corridors and screens indicate that they are there to keep visitors engaged during the busy season and that queues could get extremely long.  The lift ride up to the 117th floor was rapid, ears popping en route, and more images being screened on the walls of the lift as we travelled.  The public floors at the top of the tower are more compact than one would imagine, well organised with plenty of seating around the central section. We felt it was far less commercialised than Taipei 101, with plenty of staff available but a pretty much hands off approach.  There is a glass floor section for the brave, where you can look out or down over 100 floors. Not for the faint-hearted but a good photo opportunity. There are also two 'observation decks', which have a double door arrangement to maintain temperature within the tower. A member of staff regulates entry and exit to these decks. It was dark by the time we accessed these, the buildings were all lit up and car lights blended in along the roads out of the city and it was spectacular.  Views are wonderful. I don't think Seoul is a particularly attractive city, but this was a good way to see it and the height added something. The skies had been clear blue when we entered the Mall but, unfortunately, by the time we emerged at the top, everything was rather misty and cloudy, hence our best photos came after the sun set. Any visit is at the mercy of the weather and, particularly in February, you do take a calculated risk if you are hoping for good photos.  There are a number of retail outlets at the top of the tower with, as one would expect, Tower themed souvenirs, ranging from postcards to much more ambitious items. Prices not as hyped up as one might imagine. Bizarrely a 'pick n mix' sweet counter and a cafe, an ice cream counter and a bar lounge.  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would recommend it.\", \"It's huge , super cool. Many VR games/ rides. BUT... for almost all the main rides and popular rides, the waiting long is super long. It takes about 1.5 hours to 2 hours waiting in the queue per ride.... I didn't get to do much... only a couple. I waited for a roller coaster for 2 hours... and realized... all other rides are like that too. And, i arrive at 9:30AM early... still need to wait .\", \"The tower was a well organized interesting place to visit. We got some discount as 2 of us had birthdays the week of our visit.Going up in the lift was quite an experience because it was so fast it made your ears pop! We went up as the sun set so had daylight views as well as night time. Standing on the glass floor was quite an experience! That was just in one area though so you didn't have to do it. We couldn't go outside as it was too windy that day. The mall is just like any modern mall anywhere in the world for me. I didn't shop so can't offer an opinion about value for money.\", 'I had already been up the Namsan Seoul Tower when I went here, so thought it would be about the same. But in my opinion the view from the lotte world tower is even better. And the fact that you can stand on the glass floor on the 118th floor and look down just adds to the experience. There was also a terrance at another floor, which was unfortunatly closed when we were there.  The mall is great, with lots of stores. But there are alot of malls like that. The tower is what is truly special.', 'This mall is near to Lotte Hotel , this mall is bit expensive and if you look around properly you can find cheaper items as well , having many branded shops , good place for the shopaholics.', 'It was great to see and take photos of the actual view of the cross road beneath our feet on the glass floor at the Lotte World Tower.  TIP: Use the token given and take as many photos at every photo station. You can choose to pay only for the best shots (or none if all shots turn out bad) as souvenir.', 'So Lotte World is an indoor amusement park. I was a little burnt out on the malls in Seoul, but I did see a guitar shop which was neat. The amusement park was pretty cool, lots of English everywhere, and the rides were fun, but the highlight for me was the folk museum.  Maybe it was just because it was quieter than many of my experiences in Seoul, but it was a welcome break from the cutting edge tourism experience. The folk museum presented Korean history in engaging dioramas and excellent placards explaining the different historical periods of Korea. The highlight of the highlight though, were the huge handmade dioramas of traditional Korean life. The care and thought that went into them is enough reason to visit the museum. One of my trip highlights!', 'I had fun here with my friends. We went to most of the rides, and saw the famous Merry-Go-Round that was filmed in the drama, Stairway to Heaven kdrama. It is a nice place to come and have fun with your family and friends for sure!', 'Our American family of five, kids ages 10, 13 and 16, visited the Lotte Tower with a native South Korean. It was very nice to have our friend there, but his interpretation skills were really not necessary. We were not there to go shopping, but rather to have the Sky Tower experience. The cue area was empty for our morning visit, but if you had to stand in line, there are interesting things to look at while you wind yourself through the maze. The elevator is filled with tv screens and the ride up is amazing and beautiful. It stops near the very top and then visitors can take their time in visiting each of the floors, until they reach the very top, the 123rd floor, which consists of an expensive restaurant/lounge. Be sure to go on a relatively clear day, because you will be able to see for kilometers. Regardless of the weather, throughout much of the year the \"very fine dust that blows over from Eastern China\" obscures the view. We all liked the clear floor, so we could see straight down to the ground below. As an American from the suburbs it is impressive to see the hundreds and hundreds of apartment buildings that house the majority of South Korea\\'s population. This was a very different experience from the Seoul Tower, which honestly I preferred. However, had we visited the Lotte Tower before the Seoul Tower, we would have been unimpressed because it has fewer stories, so the view wasn\\'t quite as impressive.', 'This rather large collection of figurines showing scenes of the ancient life in Korea is very beautiful and worth spending one hour.', 'You can spend hours here, there are tourist attractions, restaurants, supermarkets, mall stores, underground shopping and dining, an adventure park, tall sightseeing tower, and connections to two major subway lines and scores of bus lines. Just go here!', \"The tower was like hundreds of floors! The view was breathtaking. You can freely take photos even on the see through glass panel on the floor. Though it's so high, the queue for the lift was amazingly fast. There's a shop selling candies, souvenirs and even a cafe. Can say that it's kinda hot and stuffy inside. Maybe bcoz we're all wearing our down jackets... hahaha....\", 'Very impressive skyscraper, which is among the tallest in the world. Beautiful surroundings, and attached is a very nice shopping mall. Everything is very clean and well organized.', 'the game here is more intended for children not teenagers or adults. the shortcomings of this amusement park are areas that are not too wide and too large for the price paid', 'My wife and I have travelling through Asia for last 3 months and I needed shaving supplies. We stopped at Lottie’s for some supplies. When the clerk helping understood I wanted travel size products she suddenly could not speak English. I made my way down to the grocery store where the staff bent over backwards to help. Perhaps boutique staff could learn a thing or 2 from them.', 'Awesome place with lotsa fund things to do and shop. Good food at level 31 & observation deck at level 118.', 'The Lotte World Tower and Mall is a must when in Seoul. The Lotte World Tower is one of the tallest building in the world and offers a day and night breathtaking view with several floors open to the public to visit from the 117th to the 121st floor. Also, you can enjoy and relax by having a dessert and a coffee while you enjoy the view or seat and get an artist to draw you a caricature plus an area to buy some nice souvenirs. You can take pictures to the inside and the outside and wait to see the beautiful sunset in one of the best cities in the world Seoul ! Finally, you can take a walk on the Mall and make sure to go outside and take walk in the park around the lake.', 'This is a must visit for anyone who would like to experience high-rise building. We took a lift to 117 floors and from there you can take pictures lying on the glass looking down. For people who afraid of heights, perhaps you can take pictures leaning on the glass windows instead. A good place to visit.', 'We were there for 6 hours. Not even a single attraction can be visited. everywhere queue. wait 2 hours at each ride.. pathetic. Poor safety management. No restriction on crowd allowing', 'Mil Feuille and Creme Brulee is awesome.  Macaron is terrific.  Capuccino is also good.  Located on the 1st floor at the Lotte World Mall.  Easily accessible buy subway.', \"The experience of riding the tower felt sort of like a ride at Disney, there are a lot of distractions to help pass the time while waiting in line. The views at the top are impressive, and the glass floor gives some great photo opportunities. Basically, though, it you have been to a tower at any other city, this is similar. One can easily come away thinking that you might have overpaid for an attraction. You can tell that the S Korean people (full disclosure: I'm Korean), are very proud of this architectural achievement, so that is where I put my mainframe when visiting this place.\", 'It was an average visit. Due to long que for each ride. We end up just got into a few. The que was quite insane. It was so cold and a lot of the outdoor rides were closed. We were compensated with the Christmas parade at the end of the visit. It was something nice to end with.', 'Visited when I did a trip around Korea, there is many things to see in Korea and this was worth a visit', 'Lotte World Tower is the tallest building in Korea and fifth tallest in the world. The view from the top floor observatory is amazing where you can see the entire Seoul in a clear day. There is a world class shopping center at the bottom where you can find all kinda of food in the world — this is a must visit when in Seoul Korea!!!!', 'Great place to hang out with friends. They have everything you can imagine. Shopping, theatre, places for kids, hotel, office space, residence, you name it. This is the tallest building in Korea and you can spot it anywhere you go in Seoul.', 'Having read some reviews and recommendations, decided to come here for the sunset. We booked the tickets for the time slot of 1630-1700 hours of entry. There is no limit in terms of duration of stay at the top of the tower. This gave us the opportunity to view the city before the sunset, and during the sunset at about 17:18, and then to take in the views of the city covered with lights when it is dark.  There is a family discounted price for 2 adults and 2 children, the tickets totalled 87,000 won, as compared to buying them individually at 27,000 won for each adult.  If you have visited the Lotte Aquarium, the ticket stub will also provide you with some discount on individual tickets (discount does not apply to the already discounted family package).  There is also some discounts for senior citizen, do ask the counter staff at ticketing booth before paying.  This is well worth the visit as you get to see the city of Seoul for 360 degrees and this is the sixth tallest tower in the world with a height of 500 metres.', \"Everything you'd expect from an upmarket shopping, hotel and office complex here - lots of stores, a cineplex, dining and the Lotte Art Museum. Very crowded on weekends, of course.\", 'beeing in Seoul, you should try to catch a view from top. Would recommend, to go there for sunset. This is something, you would miss...', \"The mall is big and spacious. You can find many branded store and restaurant here. There's a lotte mart inside the mall as well. Where you can stock up your snack while visiting to Lotte World Theme Park.\", \"We went up at sunset which was the perfect time as you have to book a slot which is available each half hour. Once you are up you can stay as long as you want though, so we went up before the sun set to see the city in the daylight and then we watched the sunset and saw the city lights. There are multiple floors when you get up: one with a glass floor and another with an outdoor area, so there is lots to see and from different viewpoints. It was extremely well organized and staff very professional and polite. The view was incredible, you can see for very far over the city and the river. Just make sure to go on a clear day. They have a sign in the ticket area about the day's viewing conditions to pick a good time for seeing the best. Would highly recommend.\", 'Great place for shopping with lots of brand. Coming during sale season for many great deals and products', \"It's 121 floors, about USD25 to enter but worth the view. Seoul is often foggy/smoggy, so if you can choose a time to go would recommend, but worth the trip.\", 'Lotte World Tower with its Seoul Sky should be on the list when visiting the city.  It gives you a nice view over the city and is reasonably priced compared to other similar viewing platforms in other cities around the world.  It was also surprisingly empty when we visited and the fact that it is stretched over 3 floors further gives you more space to roam around.  They also have a small restaurant with a few selected dishes on the fourth floor.', 'You MUST checkout this giant Tower and see the observatory deck and the seoul city from the top there it ismAWESOME', 'Don’t you know that Lotte World Tower is the fifth highest tower in the world!! We went till 122nd floor~ Such an amazing opportunity for me. I saw how beautiful Seoul City from the sky. Fyi, this tower is the highest tower in Korea. You have to pay 27000won to enjoy this facilities.  Pertamanya itu kita naik lift dari lantai 1 ke lantai 117 dalam watu tempuh hanya 1 menit! Sebagian orang didalam lift itu ada yg merasa telinganya sakit. Tapi untungnya aku ga ngerasa apa apa hehe. Boleh deh dicob', 'As everyone is know one of the best places to visit in Seoul is Seoul Tower for those who like adventure & SM Town for the K-pop lovers, n today I visited those places I really recommend for everybody bez it’s really beautiful n u can feel Korea.😂 Oh by the way Seoul Tower ticket price is 27,000 won, n SM Town 18,000 ##seoulgyeonggitour#seoultower#smtown#feelfreetovisitkorea#travel#southkorea', 'This shopping mall has a wonderful array of up-market stores and boutiques. The food court has a great array of outlets catering to many different tastes.', \"This mall is like 7 + floors. It's a shopper's dream. I stayed at the Signeil so I just took the elevator down to the mall to shop and eat every day! It's also connected to other duty free malls as well as the subway is conveniently located.\", 'An awesome experience by all. The whole area adjoining this huge megaplex is fantastic and classy. Top floor was great and worth it.', 'Lotte world is a large mall - hundreds of shops and lots of restaurants. we used it to get out of the heat for half a day.', 'I really love this place. The building is amazing and not too crowded. Price is reasonable, especially because I got the family discount. Anybody who visit Seoul should visit this place.', 'Very typical shopping mall with all international brands as well as many small stores. Big surprise: they even had a Swiss Music Box store \"Reuge\".... felt like home..', \"I found myself inadvertently exploring this huge mall as I tried to find the cinema complex which was on various floors in the main building of the mall. I was under a bit of time pressure so I didn't fully explore the full extent of the shops in the mall. But there certainly seemed to be a plethora of high end branded shops and stores as well as more than enough places to eat and drink. No doubt a compulsive shopper would have a field day here. There was even a duty free shop but I didn't go in this time.\", \"I think this mall can be a must to visit if you will stay in Seoul. huge mall with a lot of shops and restaurants. also don't miss to visit the tower. the view and the experience to see Seoul from the top is something you would try.\", 'Mall was a disappointment. Especially Avenue and duty free. Aquarium was average. Not much to see inside.', 'Lotte is a conglomerate that basically does everything. So why not a shopping mall? Enormous shopping mall with from aquarium to restaurants. If you have only one day to go shopping, visit here. They have a supermarket too.', 'I went up hot the 120th floor of the lotte world tower and is was amazing. The view from the top was amazing. You had a 360 degree view of the city. Well worth the visit.', 'I love to visit sight seeing towers whenever I go to a new city. It gives you a wonderful view of the city and this one was great. Being able to see a lot of the Olympic facilities was really awesome.', 'Coming from the malls of Bangkok this mall feels about normal. Nice and clean and busy. We wandered for and hour and it was fine.', 'A large mall with lots of American and Korean labeled retail stores. There was a Mac store, North Face store, Apple store, and etc. The high end stores are there as well such as LV, Chanel, Burberry, Gucci and so forth. There were several restaurants to choose from, including a P.F. Chang’s and other local favorites. The Hard Rock restaurant just closed.', 'the stunning elevator ride to the top was superb. We were lucky it was a clear day and needless to say the views were stunning! The outdoor viewing was another plus - the glass floors were great! Well worth the visit.', 'We went to the top ! Great views and nice places to eat in the mall near the entrance. We arrived by train to jamsil station very easy and had a walk around the lake after.', 'Spent a few hours there with the kids. They thoroughly enjoy it except for kids under 4 years old. I think this suit kids above 5 yrs old or older. Nothing much for elderly or parents looking after toddlers. I would think you can spent a whole day there. A plus point is there are shopping and you can walk to the aquarium on the other end.', 'well the mall was excellent but the prize were crazy for me lol. to enter lotte tower you need to enter inside mall, believe me you would have great times at this lotte tower', 'Look at Seoul in a very special way. 120 floors above the ground give you a stunning view of the whole city. But the price is a rather expensive and there’s quite a bit of waiting time around 30 minutes or so on weekends and holidays.', \"The Lotte World Tower and Mall is worth a detour. Not because of the mall, very nice but also very much like any high end mall. No; go up the tower. It's not cheap, but definately an experience. They e.g. have a glass floor were you have a somewhat unnerving view straigth down. But also a truly spectacular view over Seoul.\", 'The Lotte World Tower & Mall is the perfect spot for tourists who are in Seoul for the first time. With 28.000 KRW per adult it’s a bit expensive but in my opinion it‘s worth it. You can easily get there by metro since there‘s a station right beneath it. The view up there is amazing and you‘ll get a hint about the massive size of the city. Definetly a recommendation.', 'This is one of the tallest buildings in the world where you can have a panoramic view of Seoul and the famous Han River. On 118/F, it\\'s time to show your courage! The glass floor is there waiting for courageous men to step on it! Looking down through the glass can make you shake and worried if the glass breaks at any second you are staying on it! I was just so amazed how kids fear nothing - they lay on it and they even jumped up and down! \"STOP PLEASE!!!\" I screamed in my heart!  Tip: Check the sunset time and plan your trip. It admits limited people in each time slot so reserve your ticket early. Sunset view on the glass is the definite thing you want to try!', \"Upon entering this building your taught all about the building with some cool effects and oleds screens the size of the room. Stunning. Then you finally get into a double decker elevator that rockets you to the top, fastest in the world. The effects inside the elevator also cool. Then your brought to the observatory floors and you start to act like a kid. 360 views of the city and also below your feet. Both sides have glass floors, so there really isn't a line to wait to walk on glass. Theres a cafe, wifi, and some cool museum pieces. I got to to look at Napoleans hat and some hand written letters by him.. who would have thought while touring in Korea I would get some french history under my belt. Great for all types of tourists! And theres a theme park in this mega mall too, and a hotel so i suggest booking a few days here.\", 'The shopping mall is quiet expensive but food in the basement was affordable and good. The tower provides a nice view over Seoul. When we went there the sky was clear so you were able to see far.', 'This is so huge that its is impossible to completely traverse the whole place. One can get almost anything here. The lotte mart below is also very nice and reasonable price wise.on the top is the lotte tower which gives the entire city view from the 123rd floor. Good places to eat as well.', 'One of the biggest shopping malls I’ve even been too. You will be able to find almost anything you need on your shopping list here. The mall / tower / Amusement Park is all interconnected by the underground passage.', 'Go here for some good shopping and certainly has great AC as it was very hot there in August. THe Signiel Hotel in the Tower is the best hotel in Korea', 'To go to the top of the Lotte World Tower is an unique experience. From the lift till the view is fear the price that cost.', \"I thought the view was better than N Seoul Tower. You can not stand outside of N Seoul Tower. It is surrounded by glass that glares, so you can not take adequate pictures. It's also very crowded. These flaws are not shared at Lotte World Tower. You also have more stuff to do there- shopping, eating, or just walking around.\", 'We went early, and they have an early bird special so before noon it was a few thousand won cheaper. Since the building is on the east side of the city, if you go in the morning the sun will be behind you and you\\'ll have a nice view to the rest of the city of the west. It turned out to be a really good view. I would also assume sunset is the other best time to go.  Most of the floors are the same and it\\'s your standard \"going up a tall building\" experience with a fancy elevator ride and an expensive gift shop up on the top. Seoul isn\\'t really gorgeous from this eastern part of the city and the view consists mostly of endless rows of apartment blocks, Lotte World, hills, and the admittedly impressive Han River. There is no Hong Kong-or-NYC-style standout skyline feature of Seoul to see from here because you\\'re standing in it.', 'This place is really cool. You have to try the food market. I have never seen anything like it before. I also bought cosmetics. Everything you need at your finger tips.', \"Lotte World tower provides amazing views, especially at night that are worth the visit alone and it's very well connected to the Metro. Little bit expensive but a great experience.\", \"Located in the southern region of Seoul below the Han river, Lotte World Tower is one of the city's must-see attractions. At almost a half a kilometre tall (over 1,600 feet), on a sunny day it can cast a shadow in the sky and provides stunning 360 degree views of the vast metropolis. Taking only around sixty seconds to reach the multi-level viewing deck, you can step onto caged outside balconies, stand on a glass floor looking down onto busy traffic, take photos with ubiquitous kawaii mascots and marvel at the flawless overall undertaking and accompanying production (LED screens, computer graphics). Unlike other sky-high decks visited, the attraction doesn't have add-on charges for other experiences once you're up there - a welcome change to the usual tourist up-sell. Visited on a weekday, the number of visitors was relatively low and allowed ample opportunities to take the perfect photo. Entry is via the basement, which is part of the larger Lotte World mall.  The mall itself offers plenty of local and international fashion brands in addition to a vast variety of retail, loads of food and beverage options and can be travelled to and from via the complex's underground railway station. The mall is spread over two buildings, one of which is the glamorous home to upscale couture boutiques. While unvisited, adjacent to the mall is the Lotte World theme park.\", 'Bit out of Seoul city. Good amuzement park for little ones. Must visit place is the tower. You can get a good view.', 'Up to 123 floors, the view is awesome with many guid! Lift is super fast plus video showing!  *We been to see Kaws holiday from tower which is a really great option.  到頂樓觀看全首爾市景真的是一件觀光必做的選擇， 比較起目前去過的其他國家這裏的規劃很完善，可以一目暸然各個景點外， 環境也很乾淨，搭乘的電梯甚至有播放市景影片！ 部分區域還有透明地面可以直視一樓非常有趣！！！（雖然會有點暈）', 'Lotte World Tower or \"Seoul Sky\" is much like other observation deck experiences. As you buy your tickets you can check what the weather and visibility is like. Prices were reasonable. Got a 9000kw discount as it was my birthday month (need to prove with passport). There is security screens, a bit of queuing and photos to be taken before you get to the elevator. But having been to other Observation Towers, this is not unusual. The fancy super video screens were though. The price of the photos was very good!! Up the top there\\'s a few levels. One allows you to go outside, and another has the glass floor to test your brain (I struggle to step out into the glass floor). One level had a video to show what old Korea looked like compared to now which was interesting. We checked out the top most observation deck, where you had to purchase food or drink to attend, but it was 27000kw for a chicken sandwich so we passed. It was the first time we had seen really inflated prices so we were shocked. But overall it was a good experience. Only a must see if you like seeing the sprawling city. Back on the ground floor in the mall was s really nice restaurant that had Italian food - pizza, pasta and a lamb salad that was to die for!! But I know, you don\\'t go to Korea for Italian food but when you\\'re with a bunch of ex-pats they are hanging for a taste of what they miss from home!! and pizza and salad are hard to find!!', 'We accidentally came across this mall. A mall is a mall, so nothing special about the shops. However, the basement where the supermarket is located, there were heaps of food stalls. It was food galore for us. Koreans delights and great food for lunch!', 'One gets a wonderful view of the whole Seoul from the top of this tower; it is a worthwhile experience, although very expensive. After paying the entrance fee, the visitors are taken through a long path before reaching the elevator to the top of the tower and have to waste their time while the staff takes compulsory photos of them; if one wants a copy of any photo, one has to pay extra money.', \"Awesome vista point. You can see for miles. The elevators are incredibly fast, and you reach the top in no time. Your ears my pop because it's so high. Once up top, you have an awesome view of everything. They have a glass floor on the edges that you can see through allllll the way to the bottom.  Super scary if you're scared of heights. Cool place to visit.\", 'I visited with my 25 year old and 16 year old son a couple days after visiting N Tower. I think Lotte World Tower was a nicer (maybe because it is newer) visit. I have recommended this to my friends who travel in Korea.', 'Idea is great and the whole entrance procedure like entering space shuttle. You will experience the extreme feelings to enter the glass floor ;) There is also the balcony which is great to visit. View on Seoul is amazing. It worth to be in Lotte Tower.', 'We wandered into this place quite accidentally. After going to the Lotte mall, my 11 year old son suggested we go to the top of the tower and see the whole city. We went and asked the security man and were introduced to Seoul Sky. A very interesting lift ride with distraction videos on its walls took us to 117th floor. From here there are escalators to the higher floors. On 118th floor, there is a glass floor observatory where the brave can stand and the timid can take photos anyway. Can be quite scary but I lay on my back instead of standing and took some selfies showing the streets below. On every level you can take photos of Seoul. For example the Han river and Olympic Park. There is a place for photos which you buy or you can take your own. There are also souvenir shops and I think there was a small cafe. Then back to the lift and down to the mall. It was an awesome experience despite some cloudiness.', \"You might be curious about visiting the Lotte World Tower, and rightfully so. It's the 5th-tallest building in the world, but many don't realize it has the third-highest observation deck on the planet! This is a rare structure in which your head will surpass 500m above the ground, something that wasn't even possible until the past decade.  One level features a glass floor, for those who are daring enough to walk out, and two small outdoor decks with protective netting if you want to smell the air up there. They offer plenty of souvenirs and even a tiny bit of food. But don't bank on having dinner up there. Much like the World Trade Center in New York, you're treated to a visual montage on the elevator ride up so you can appreciate the evolution of the surrounding city.  And while you're here, you might as well go below ground to the insanely massive mall with endless stores and excellent dining options. Eventually, you find yourself at an aquarium and an ice rink. I mean this tower and mall literally have everything you could ever imagine!\", \"It's pretty cool being up the Lotte World Tower! I believe I spent 27,000Won and I caught the last trip up around 8pm (they close around 10pm I believe). The elevator going up/down has some really cool videos of the Tower. Very entertaining! It also shows you what floor you're in and how many meters you're up above the ground!! OMG! I love the views, the gift shops, and the restaurants up the Tower. The restaurants are a little pricey though lol! Go during the day or night, you will definitely have plenty of picturesque view of the city underneath you! There's also a place where you can go outside and experience a nice breeze! It was really nice! Go and check it out for yourself! Also, parking is plenty around the Mall and the surrounding area if you are driving to get there.\", \"For one thing, it was so quick to get inside and to the top of the tower. At the top, views are 360 and you can stay as long as you like. Couple of coffee shops but we came down to enjoy the Mall afterwards. Both fantastic with the choice you'd expect in Seoul.\", \"great view of seoul and neighboring cities. If you lack time and would like to see the whole seoul bird's eye view, this is the best spot. it has also a very good options for food at the food court.\", \"This absolutely surpassed my expectations. The mall is just like all the other 10,000 malls in Seoul. The tower is just amazing. It has a glass floor that hangs over the side of the building. It is a very cool experience. There are two sides where you can step out over the glass ledge, and there is an outdoor observation area too. That was pretty cool.  The views are just amazing. It is hard to even describe how amazing the views are. Very impressive.  There are several coffee shops, candy stores and a gift shop. Those are fine.  If you don't do this, I promise you are missing out!\", 'Good place and very affordable entrances with ride all you can, but you need to go there morning so that you can enjoy everything.', 'A Great once and done park. Always crowded. It is a great attraction that you want to check off your Seoul list, but if you miss it, you will live.', 'This was an experience. The glass floor view is really exciting and made for some great picture taking. The Elevator ride was fast, but could not even feel it. There is plenty of space to walk around and see the views of the city.', 'There is an expression, “You’ll know it when you see it”. It could also be said, “You’ll know it when you feel it”. From the second we entered the Lotte World Tower, a sensation came over me as I looked up at the endless high ceiling. Before I go any further let me state, for you to truly experience this magnificent hotel you should have the option to experience the elements of surprise. Therefore, I will present only basic facts enough to peak your interest without giving away all the unique features you will experience. If you were to google a map of Seoul the most obvious feature you will notice is a building towering above all other structures. The Lotte World Tower is the tallest building in South Korea, reaching 123 floors at a height of 1,819 feet. It is the fifth tallest building in the world. Just for the record, our room number was 9882! That is correct the 98th Floor! The view was breathtaking and certainly the highest floor we have had the pleasure of staying for the night. The hotel is connected to the Lotte World Mall. The Mall is exceptionally large, modern and beautiful offering a host of famous brand names with numerous places to eat with a variety of delicacies from around the world. In the basement of the hotel is an outstanding Aquarium truly worth visiting. Their specious lounge, is a place we frequently visited to relax and enjoy the panoramic view of the city located on the 79th floor. There is an outstanding observation deck located on the 123-floor overlooking the city. From our room we could see the river that was incredible especially when watching the city lights at night. The hotel of course offers all the amenities found only in the top luxury hotels. Wait until you see your uniquely designed room especially the bathroom! I highly recommend you take advantage of their outstanding breakfast. Everything is fresh and with a variety of choices that are professionally served. My suggestion is order their smoothie, the combinations of taste is exceptionally delicious. Of all the highlights offered by any hotel it always comes down to the quality of service by the staff. Having travelled around the world the personnel at the Signiel hotel we would rate above outstanding. Their kindness and efficiency is second to none and they make you feel right at home. We consider the whole complex a “City within a city”. Seoul has hundreds of top end hotels to choose from but, if you want to truly experience something from a fancy world, the choice is obvious. It certainly captured our hearts the moment the doors were open. On a personal note, when visiting a new hotel, I always make a concretive effort to try and find flaws. Paying particularly attention to the smallest details to challenge their efforts to put their best foot forward. I can honestly say without hesitation; this hotel is truly a Perfect 10!', 'On my last evening in Seoul , I saw this amazing building from my hotel room ! Nobody had told me about it , so I arranged to go by taxi and was invited by a Korean friend to visit The Signiel hotel . This building is stunning . I was staggered by the scale of it and from a distance it has a kind of timeless futurist design . As we approached it by taxi , it was dusk and the dynamic lighting of the complex at the foot of this mountain of a building was very state of the art ... we went up to the top floors of the viewing tower . And the video installations in the corridors were breathtaking . The elevator has 360 video art which distracts from the fact that we rise 101 floors in 60 seconds .. the views from the top at night are the pride of modern South Korean life !! Seoul looks like a perfect Eutopia from this viewpoint . The Signiel Hotel is also like stepping into a SF movie .. mega expensive, but worth it !!', 'This is definitely a must see location. You have to get down, in the basement that is, to go up, up up! From the amazing plasma displays, the architectural history, to the phenomenal views this place is worth the trip. We spent about 2 hours peering out of Seoul Sky and then a few more in the mall. In Seoul Sky there are a few cafes, a gift shop and a restaurant. The views are spectacular. It is worth the 27000 won for adults. Lotte Tower does not allow you to make online reservations with foreign credit cards. So get there early.  Cheers!', 'Absolutely my favourite place in Seoul. Very nice area and the Mall beside is amazing. I miss this place!  View Sublime!', 'As a Lotte Hotel Guest I got a discount and quickly ascended to the top. The Tower opened April 2017 and is very impressive.', 'The Lotto tower is a must to visit. You feel as a little thump when you are near the tower The area around the tower will also surprise you, so you will find the van Gogh bar, you will see the wealth in the special shops. People will arive bij car and chauffeur to do their shopping Oh yes you can also to the top of the tower to enjoy the view over the town', 'supper mall if you are in Seoul this is something you need to do and go to the top the rest you will figure out', 'Comparing to other towers, the full experience is incredible! Since you start walking thru the elevator, you will be able to admire how the building was made and a comparison between old and new Seoul.  Eventouhth its expensive, you must visit it!', 'I went to lotte tower whilst visiting korea during the olympics an the view from the top is amazeing. It was was a vit overcast when i went but on a clear day i can imagine it to be brilliant. Theres plenty to do here aswell, shopping, eating food an theres even an aqaurium in there. Defo worth a visit if your in Seoul.', \"We traveled over to this side of town strictly to go up the tower and see the city. We went up in the afternoon and there was no wait at all. The elevators were really cool! View at the top was nice and the windows were clean (a pet peeve of mine when taking pictures). There is an area that you can stand over a glass floor, which doesn't have any additional cost. We walked around the mall afterward, which had some cool stores and places to get a snack.\", 'I have visited the place a few times and this time the tower is fully completed and in business. It is a majestic landmark. Seokchon Lake in front of it is very beautiful in early April, with flourishing cherry blossoms. The lake is romantic at night with lakeside lights. The lake is sort of divided into two sections, separated by a bridge, but one could walk around the whole lake along the walkway. It is somewhat confusion trying to get to the lake, but I usually choose to either get out from Exit 2 of Jamsil metro station or from Exit 14 of Lotte World Tower.', 'The Lotte World Tower has a wonderful observation deck st the top of what is the 5th tallest building in the world. Avoid weekends to avoid long lines. Try to go on a weekday afternoon when the sky is clear. Very fast elevator to the top and incredible views of Seoul', \"Quite a distance from mid town, and the entrance fee was $28 for an adult. We saw the sunset and the night view, very nice. The final stop was the restaurant which we didn't know until we got up there. You wont be able to see anything unless you order. So we left. I wish we didn't have to go up to that floor. The floors below had marvelous view already.\", 'This is amazing. It is a place for all.Centre for shopping and dining . Also best place for kids and there is full division of game zone. Aquarium is worth going.', 'I love skyscrapers, so this one was a must. Very impressive when you first lay eyes on it. Plenty of shops in the mall, and plenty to do around it too. Go to the Seoul Sky (117th floor I think) or have a drink at the hotel (81st floor bar of Signiel hotel), amazing!', \"Although it may be a bit hot in the elevator and on the top floor during February, but in general I think it's a pretty cool experience. A must see as there is a bunch of shops on the ground floor and a nice park nearby (plus world famous Lotte World). If you have 5-6 days in Seoul it's definitely a place to see.\", 'We went here expecting to spend a few hours or so here, but with the smoking and dirt every where we did not stay long. Things were also not good quality or cheaper than at home in Australia.', \"This is one of the tallest towers in the world, so we decided to pay the exorbitant entrance fee to see it for ourselves. You can pay by cash or by credit. After you pay your entrance fee you are taken to the lifts which take you to the observation platforms. The lift in itself is a bit of an experience – there are screens on all the walls and the ceiling which display a short show about the tower while you are riding up.  The towers are impressively tall, and from that distance you lose perspective of how high up you actually are. There are several observation deck levels, and each deck has something different on offer. There is a level that has a couple of glass floor areas where you can look down to the street below (that's a bit freaky at first!), there's a level where you can go to a balcony area, there is a cafe and when we were there there were displays commemorating the winter Olympics and some statues of the Olympic mascots that you could have photos with.  We got there at sunset, which was really nice. We stayed for long enough to see the sun go down and the lights of the city come on. We were there for about an hour all up.\", 'If you want high-end good, this is the place. Otherwise, skip it as this mall is nothing special and is devoid of any character. Limited dining options too. Coex is a better choice.', 'Go there. This is the best Mall ever. I do not think we have one as nice in the United States. There is food, Designer Shops, Shoes, everything a person would want in the mall. There is an Aquarium and an Art Museum. I enjoyed it so much I went back a second time. The train station has underground shopping also and you can access the mall from the train station.', '5the tallest building in the world. Just opened earlier this year. If you are in the Jamsil area on a clear date, make a trip to the top. We paid about $26 for adults and $23 for 15 and younger. It claims to have he fastest elevator in the world. It’s also a double decker elevator. Views up top are truly spectacular.', 'Lotte Tower is the most iconic shopping mall in Korea. It is pretty standard as far as malls go, with a large variety of stores and restaurants, but also it has some unique places and features. If you want to shop, I would recommend here. It is a pretty standard mall, but the sheer size is the most amazing part. Also, if you are interested you can also visit the top of the tower. Being the tallest tower in the OECD means that it has some amazing views. Not only that, but Seoul is also one of the biggest metropolitan areas in the world sitting at around 25million people. What does this mean? An amazing view!', 'I went on a Monday so it wasn’t that busy. I paid the standard price (no fast pass needed when I went). You go through security screening. The employees are very efficient and nice in directing you where to go. The views are breathtaking and peaceful. There is a small outside deck on the floor where you exit, very cool experience. I can’t say enough.', \"The Lotte Tower Seoul Sky observatory should certainly be listed as one of the highlights of a visit to Seoul. The views, especially of the Han River, at sunset, and just after sunset are breathtaking. You can also see the Olympic Park very well. Admission at 27,000 won is reasonable compared to other World Class towers. There was no wait when we visited on at 6 pm Monday evening. The surrounding area is also of interest, for example Lotte World. There was a haze but it wasn't too bad. Seoul is a fascinating mix of its ancient civilization, the devastation and its unflinching remembrance of its bitter first half of the 20th Century, and the current relentless vitality, affluence and modernity of today. Along with the frenetic shopping districts, the Lotte Tower is an iconic symbol of the latter. Don't miss it !\", 'One of the best places in seoul The tower is the fifth tallest building in the world The mall is good and containing some international restaurants  Variety of shops international and Korean Luxury shopping ( LV , Dior ext.) International shops ( guess , Nike . . Ext)  The metro station ( jamsil ) is in the B1 store , which takes you directly to the mall  There is also Lotte mart , which is a supermarket if you would like to grab some fresh food ( fruits , veges )', 'Great building, very tall and the panoramic level is the highest in the word. In september, it wasn’t very busy and the climbing process went pretty fast. It is worth visiting. I have been in panoramic buildings, but this is the far most impressive.', 'The mall is located in a upscale area so with that comes upscale prices. Modern designed and clean mall with many artistic displays. Luxury designer brands line the first 2 to 3 floors.Dining options are located on the basement level with some play areas and shops for kids. This place is a shoppers paradise but if shopping is not really your thing it can been browsed quickly or even skipped without feeling like you missed much.', 'Normal if you visit at the day time. Around the tower have shopping mall, duty free and supermarket', 'The fees for the Seoul Sky was quite expensive but at least the scenery is worth it. Glass floor panel was interesting.', 'As one of the tallest buildings in the world, this was a must-see for me being a real estate enthusiast. The views and experience are worth it. Nice shopping, dining, and sightseeing experience all around. Try visiting just before sunset so you can get both daylight and nighttime photos. Once you ride the elevator up, you can spend as long as you want on the top floors so you can relax, take photos, and just soak it all in.', 'You can only buy the replica of Seoul tower from the tower, the best thing is to have coffee on the 123rd floor.', \"Like most places in fashion district, the shopping in over-rated. Don't expect to find fashion cheap like in Taipei or Hong Kong, the prices are close to what you will get in the USA or online order directly from Seoul. If you are not tiny and thin, you probably won't find clothes fit you.\", 'We had a great afternoon here. The views from the top are fantastic and superior to those from the Namsan Tower on the other side of Seoul. The glass floors were fun albeit scary for the wife which added to the entertainment. Well worth adding to your itinerary if visiting Seoul for more than a few days.', 'The tower was not open when we were there but it looks nice. Lots of shopping, with almost every store available. Prices were higher than in the US, so I would know your pricing before shopping.', 'This place is huge, it includes shops, the tower and an indoor theme park. It was perfect for us on a rainy day.', 'Pricey but is gret to go once to see the skyline and to step on the clear glass and look down. The mall has a good variety too. If you have a mastercard you get a discount 10% At night is best because there is no wait', \"We were accidentally visiting this mall on our way to Lotte World. Lotte World Mall is a high end mall. This mall has so many expensive brands. It's a nice place to do window shopping. Its location is in front of Lotte Department Store Jamsil (Lotte World is inside this Lotte Dept Store.  The unique thing in this mall is all the escalators operate after 10.30.\", \"Big shopping centre but with the added attraction of Lotte Tower and and acquarium. Once you've seen one shopping centre, you've seen them all\", 'Seoul Sky is located on the 117th ~ 123rd floors of Lotte World Tower - Sky Terrace - and is the 5th tallest building in the world. Great', 'This mall was quite far from the Seoul city, but you can reach here by using the subway train. We went to this mall because we want to go to the Hard Rock Cafe.', 'I originally came to this to photograph the building but soon was taken in by the department store, then the mall, the the amusement park...and more. I managed to find a wonderful group of locks on a fence to proclaim their love in the park next too the building.', \"Mostly high end shops so it's a good place if you like window shopping or have ALOT of money. We did find Krispy Kreme donuts!\", 'Really enjoyed a visit to the top decks of this tower. Went up at night and the view is definitely spectacular! One floor has a corner with glass floor panels where one can look down and see the ground a couple hundred meters below... A great place to take pictures.  The mall has a luxurious feeling and there are plenty of shops from well known brands and restaurants to buy whatever one desires.', \"It was a really great trip to the top of Lotte Tower! It was a bit overcast that day but the views were still spectacular. There are several floors you can go to and there are glass floors you can look through. I would have loved to go to the outside observation areas but it was apparently too cold so they were blocked off. Overall, it was well worth the price. Barely any lines and it wasn't too crowded. Would love to see the views on a clear, sunny day!\", 'This is a really tall tower that you can see in a clear day from Yeoido. Have areally incredibl view of the city i will say the best view of the city. If you go to Seoul this is a must go tower and mall. Lotte did and incredible job with this tower at night have beutiful lights.', \"Great selection of high end brands. Chanel and Van Cleef sales staff were wonderful. Hermes not so much. Maybe they couldn't speak English. just stood there and stared at you hahaha..so strange.\", 'The elevator ride itself is worth the price of admission. There are five floors for your viewing pleasure. I think the third observation floor (120th floor) has a clear floor that sticks out over the city street below.There is a cafe, professional photographers and a gift shop among other things. It is real easy to burn through several hours up there even with an overcast day!', \"Busy but interesting food court with many varieties of Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese foods. The prices are amazing, with basic sneakers going for around $250 and above. OK for browsing, but don't buy!\", \"We visited the Lotte Tower on an overcast day, but it was still enjoyable. There is a lot to look at on the way up and plenty of space to view once you get to the observation areas. There is even a glass floor section to enjoy! There is a cafe or two, a restaurant, and gift shops. If you are a military family, they offer a military discount.  The mall is divided into several sections! One section has many restaurants with cuisines from around the world.There are high and low-end stores, novelty shops, dessert shops. The other section of the mall has many restaurants that are familiar to Americans: On the Border, Hard Rock Cafe, P.F. Changs, Califonia Pizza, Krispy Cream. There are several other restaurants that offer a variety of choices! There is a beauty section, plenty of sweets, children's clothing, a caricature booth, and an amazing movie theater! It is huge! They offer 4DX movies there and you can select your seat before going in. They also have some interesting snacks to select from at the concession stands. Military discount is available!  Jamsil station connects the subway directly to the mall! it is so convenient!\", 'Enjoy it very much. Too large to cover all areas, It is advisable to buy the Magic Pass, because eventhough we went there on weekdays but there were so many people and some attractions, we had to queue for 1 hour', \"Frankly, i don't really think it is that wonderful. Observatory deck - Been to a few other observatory decks in Japan and Dubai, Lotte World observatory deck is on the average side. The only memorable thing i remember is the glass panel on the floor. Lotte World Mall - the first 4 levels are all the branded stuff and only B1 house more affordable brands. Nothing much. Although i must say, they have tons of eatery places here so surely you can find something that suits your taste.\", \"Don't let the tower's price tag deter you. There are several spots to relax on the 6+ floors (I know, right?) of viewing pleasure up at the top of the LOTR looking tower that apparently blocks Korean jets from blowing DPRK nukes out of the sky.  Anyways, I'd recommend coming up before sunset and staying for the city lighting up. It's lovely and the glass floor is a mind-altering experience. The wifi is free and strong so you can make a nice snap or insta story whilst on top of the world.\", 'You could easily spend a full day in the mall itself. The tower is amazing and definitely worth a visit. Even if you have an hour or so free time, I’d recommend a visit just to see it.', '仕事でロッテホテルワールドに滞在中に立ち寄りました。地下道でつながっているため、便利です。地下一階にチケットカウンターがあります。地上123階、555メートルの高さに、約１分で移動します。世界で５番目に高いビルです。エレベーターに乗車する前の通路が美しかったです。エレベーター内では、花火の映像が楽しめます。外観は、ロッテホテルワールドから撮影したものです。I had to go to for a while business trip to South Korea.This was my first time to go there.And I went to LOTTE WORLD TOWER SEOUL SKY.This Tower is a 123-floor, 554.5metre(1,819 ft) supertallskyscraper located in Seoul, South Korea. It opened to the public on April 3, 2017 and is currently the tallest building in the OECD, and is the 5th tallest building in the world.', 'right in Jamsil, beautiful shopping mall with gold on everything. Noticed that the reception ladies are all gorgeous!', 'I liked this new tower very much. It is fifth tallest in the world. There are several levels for viewing and with snack shops with a restaurant on the very top level. It is over the Lotte mall which is fabulous. Nice souvenir items inclduing photos. Did not experience a long line in the winter. No outdoor viewing permitted in January.', \"Lotte Tower is the tallest building in Seoul and the 5th tallest building in the world. There is a 123 floor, located songpa-gu district. It is just near jamsil station. You can reach using green line ( line number 2) and use exit 1 or 2. The elevator is like a high speed train,it takes a couple of seconds to reach top of the tower. You can take a good profil photos and also you can catch beautiful city view. It gives you a 360 degree city view. I went up the tower in the evening. I was unlucky that the weather was so foggy. So be sure that the weather is clear. You can go daytime and also evening. Two of these situations give you a different beauty of the city. Han river, Namsan Tower, Gangnmam etc... To go up the tower gives you a valuable opportunity to see all of city districts. The cost wast a little bit expensive but it worth. It was 27000 Won as you see in the photo that I uploaded. . The appropriate time to spend there is approximately between 1 and 1.5 hour. You can stay more because there is no limitation to stay there. There is also cafe and restaurant that you can grab some snacks.  Also you can have chance to take some incredible attraction photo when you are in the first floor. They take your photo and when you go up the tower you can buy your photo or photos from reception which is located floor 120 or 121. You can print out it there or they give you a scan code and using scan code you can download your smart phone or tablet in that time. The cost was around 10 000 Won as I remember. I think you should try with your friends or family. You will not regret.  You can bring your baby, children etc. Don't worry it so safe :)\", 'Visitors only can access to a few floors for free. If you want to go to the top floor, you need to buy an expensive ticket.', \"The tower is located near Jamsil station, and you don't need to actually exit the station precinct to enter the tower. It should take you around 40 minutes from the Myeong-Dong area.  Once you buy the ticket and go through the turnstiles, it will take you around twenty minutes to reach the top floor. The entire process is orderly, but takes time, and that can be a bit boring.  On the top floor, the views are stunning. Having visited Tōkyō Sky Tree, Sydney Tower, Gold Coast Q1, Auckland Tower, and Tsūtenkaku in Osaka, this place offers good value. The tickets are reasonable and the place looks brand new.\", 'The Tower was finished 2016 and has a beautiful architecture inside and outside. If you want to get an Impression of Seoul and the development of the city after the civil war go there. With 555 m it is as far as height is concerned building number 5 in the world. You can go up to 486 m with the elevator. From this floor you have a perfect view of the Olympic area right below you, the skyline and the river. For us it was the number one sight in Seoul.', \"This tower is 122 stories high and has remarkable views of Seoul. It is the tallest building in Seoul and the 5th tallest building in the world. Part of the floor is made of clear Plexiglas so the brave can take pictures of them appearing to be hovering over the city. Not this lady though. I have a terrible fear of heights. As long as I wasn't anywhere near the Plexiglas, I was fine. They have a souvenir shop and some restaurants in the tower. It costs 27000 won to enter but you can stay as long as you like. The ride up in the elevator takes only 40 seconds. I'm glad we took the time to visit here.-+\", 'The mall houses the Lotte World theme park but our sole purpose of visit was to the Ghibli store and Lego store.  After navigating the labyrinthine subway malls (we arrived by metro) we were told there were two sections of Lotte; Tower wing and Mall wing. From our quick visit, there were plenty of eateries and obviously shops. The Lotte world theme park entrance at the basement was packed with students and kids.  Great place with lots to see if craving for some retail therapy.', 'This is the tallest in Korea and 5th in the world. It was a sunny day and the view was great.  You have to pay 27,000 won as entrance fee and it’s worth it. They have a cafe and a souvenir shop at the 121st flr.  Still worth a visit.', 'was staying in Lotte Hotel Seoul which offers free shuttle to its new and shiny sister hotel in Jamsil.  The exterior is very impressive and we even went to the top of the tower with its most interesting elevator ride.  However the entry fee to the top is pretty steep and the view is nothing to write home about.  The mall itself is like any other shopping mall in Seoul.', \"I went there to go up in the tower. I was very desapointed because it was close and no one could give me exact information about when it would open. The Mall it's incredible like so many in Seoul.\", \"It is a great place to go with details since you enter. Don't miss the short film at the beginning of your experience. Sit down and enjoy all the monuments the film shows. It also has a tree that shows the different seasons in Korea. It is a very visual experience since the start. Fully recommended.\", 'One of the tallest buildings in the world. Was interesting to look around the shopping centre and then go up the tower. There is also a theme park and numerous restaurants. Worth a visit.', 'We spent 3 hours plus at the observatory deck to appreciate the beautiful sun-set view. The elevator ride to the observatory deck was interesting similar to taking a chilling ride. It took only less than a minute to reach the top (level 115). The city view of Seoul was not fantastic but can view a nice sun-set on a great sunny day.', 'It is complex malls. Amusement park, indoors and outdoors. Department store, observatory, duty free shop, cinema, book store, lots of restaurants, etc. If you stay nearby, it is a must to visit', \"It's expensive ($25) to ride up to the top for city views but still worth seeing all of Seoul from its observation decks. You can buy a photo of yourself taken as you enter with various backdrops.\", \"We took the trip to the top of the tower on a reasonably clear day, and could see for about 15 kms max., but enough to experience the panorama that is Seoul. The elevator in itself is a memorable experience, and on a whole is well managed and arranged. Definitely worth doing. Book online in advance if it's a busy time of the year, and with the Seoul Visitors map there is a discount for the ticket pricer (see ad on the map available from Tourist Info)\", 'Quite expensive but up 500m you have like six different floors to explore. You will have your view over Seoul from its best view. Make sure it’s a clear day or night.', '...but the view is always depending on the weather. We have been there and took the VIP Tour. Really great guided tour with interesting information. The ride with the (at least they said) fastest elevator in the world is quite short but impressive how fast you are on upper level. From there you have to enjoy the amazing view. We did with a beer :-)', \"It's -by far- the highest building in Seoul and one of the highest in the world. For a sky-scrapers lover, it really worth a visit. There is a hotel on the top of the building, so, the best way to enjoy the view is, while drinking your drink at the bar of the hotel.\", \"the review is for only the tower. we stayed at Lotte hotel and best part of it was, we got tix from the hotel. We didn't have to wait in line and went straight up b/c we got the tix from the hotel. That was GREAT !!! It takes a min to get to 110 floor. You can go to the cafe or to the restaurant. Otherwise, it's just looking at the view. I enjoyed it and would say, set aside 30-45min. There's a line to get down but it went fast around late afternoon. They don't let you take a stroller, they keep it downstairs for you.\", \"I didn't want to go to this place. Our friends went, so I went. So glad I went. What an experience. Please go onto the plexiglass floor.You'll get that special feeling between thrill and wanting to use the bathroom.\", 'Basically similar with other high end malls in other cities. The tower will give you the sight of Seoul City.  As a muslim traveller, the muslim praying room is one the best I’ve been to in a non muslim country... halal food is tricky as a lot of retail use pork and seafood restaurants are very expensive options. Thankfully we found Poke Bowl in the food court near the theme park entrance.', 'Already the architechture of this tower is breathtaking. Looking at the city of the deck on a hight of 500m is unforgettable.pricing of KRW24000 is okay.', \"If the elevator ride wasn't impressive enough, the views will thrill you even more. Unfortunately, the outdoor terrace portion wasn't open when I was there, but the see-thru floors were vertigo inducing on their own.\", 'Seuol largest shopping centre full of every brand you ever heard of and endless restaurants. Great travel links, and a pleasant park and landscaping outside to relax', \"Korea's tallest building had multiple safety issues before construction was completed including cracks in the floor of the movie theater and in the glass of tanks in the aquarium. They took care of these issues and reopened these areas. That being said, there's nothing really special here. It's a shopping mall with a movie theater and aquarium at the base of a tall building. Don't drive here, parking in the underground garage is outrageous.\", 'Impressive observation deck with beautiful views from the tallest building in Seoul. The elevator ride is fully immersive and very impressive with LED screens on all walls. The observation deck offers views facing multiple directions and also features a glass floor for those looking for a little thrill. There is a small café and a candy stand on the observation deck floors. The building itself also houses multiple malls meeting a range of price points, and a large food court as well as offices.', 'If you visit Seoul and you have some Korean wons left you must visit this place; Lotte is the biggest shopping mall in the city ( with also some duty free shops at Incheon airport ) Beware not to get lost, this mall is huge and easy to find on one of the most known avenues in the city.', 'Fantastic views over the city and beyond. Go at sunset and have a beer on the 123rd floor. Wonderful.', \"The Lotte World Tower and the adjacent Mall are the latest touristic highlights of Seoul. During my last visit I missed coming out here, but this time I went there 3 times to see kit 'all'. You can take the Metro Lines 2 & 8 to get there.\", 'Lotte world tower and mall is a huge mall.  Conveniently located at Jamsil station (line 2 and 8) - exit 1/2.  Main attraction is Seoul sky which is a must visit place - though a bit expensive. I have written a separate review for the same.  This mall is no different from Other high end malls of the city. Multiple shops to buy from, many of them offer instant tax refund on shopping above 30000 won. Many places to eat as well.', 'We enjoyed the place, it offers information regarding the tower and some historical information. Nice show in the elevator. At the top there are a great view, great souvenirs shops, coffee shop and restaurant. And glass floor view for the braves. The mall is huge with great shopping experience.', \"If you've been to Dubai, it will somewhat remind you of Dubai Mall. I don't think it's as big but the feel of the mall is huge & fancy, also connected to a metro stop as well as there's an aquarium!\", 'We visited the tower on a weekday evening and there was no crowd at all. I guess it was the absence of tourists that made the entire visit so pleasant. The view at sunset seems to be one of the better time to visit too, as the sun set the building and street lamps came on. Simply spectacular.', \"Opening in 2017 the Lotte World Tower is one of the world's tallest buildings, I only made it to the 76th floor for a private dinner (with another 50 floors or so to go to the summit), but even from there the panoramic views of Seoul are impressive. I would definitely come back to go to the top when I have more time !\", \"This is the 5th in the world and 4th in Asia. I've seen the others and this compares favourably. The architecture us classical yet beautiful. Connected to an amazing huge futuristic mall.  Located at Jamsil area. The observation deck from floors 117 upward costs about $50 but the queue is extreme.  Plenty of food choices in the mall. But be prepared to wait\", 'This shopping mall is new, in connection of the Lotte skyscraper in Jamsil. The most surprising finding was the DIY juice place on the second floor worthwhile to test.', \"Yes, I would rate this as my first choice of favorite super towers, and I've seen a lot of them around the world. Mainly I am impressed with the design and technology along with the great variety of things to do in this tower.  It just opened a few months ago and at 123 floors above ground and 6 floors below ground (parking), it contains practically everything you would ever want. Plan on going VERY EARLY at opening and spend all day. We were there for 2 days. The observation decks are on the top 5 floors (117-123), a hotel from about the 75th to about the 100th floor, residences around the 42nd to 70th floor, and private offices higher up. At 1,800 feet tall, you better not have a fear of heights to visit. Also, this place is very crowded. Furthermore, there is an aquarium, movie theatre, more shops than you can visit in a day, and places to eat although later in the afternoon and evening, it is practically impossible to get anything to eat without waiting a VERY LONG TIME. I this there is approximately 3 million square feet in this mega structure. It can be seen from anywhere in Seoul and one of the top 5 tallest in the world as they claimed. As expected, there is security to get into the building, but not a big deal.  The roughly $50 US dollar cost to express up to the observation decks is much too expensive in our opinion, yet worth it for a one time experience. The transparent floors (some people say glass floors) on the observation deck is incredible. Some people were to scared to stand on them. The elevator to get up there is large, fast, and unique with video displays and high tech. It's the most unusual elevator I've ever seen. Going back done after being up on the observation decks for almost an hour, the staff couldn't manage getting the large number of people in the elevator. Lots of people packed in there with people touching us on all sides. Fortunately it is about only a minute up and down. Ears popping due to the fast speed, yet smooth ride so you don't sense how fast it is moving.  If you come later in the day you will regret being lazy as the lines for mostly anything are long; tickets, elevators, restaurants, etc.  If you are going for the tower and the view, choose a good clear day. One couple told me they were there the prior day and disappointed that they were in the clouds and saw nothing after paying 50,000 Korean Won. I mentioned did they consider standing on the ground and looking up to see if the top of the tower is visible before buying the ticket? If you can't see it when looking up, then you won't see anything when you get up there. No common sense with those folks.  If you are not interested in the tower, you can spend a whole day just shopping or looking around at all the unique sculptures, art, and shops (some affordable and some are high end expensive items).  My rating does not include the fact that in my opinion, this place is not really for elderly people or folks with strollers and wheel chairs as it is much too crowded and no place to sit or rest.  If you go to Seoul and don't visit, then you will miss out on a great experience.\", 'I must say this has got to be one of the best towers that I have visited. Its not the typical tower that you see when you visit a city which is usually one floor. Here they have 3 floors with the 20thF being the best because of the glass bottom floor and the open balcony. Aside from having a fantastic view of the city you can instantly post your pics as there wifi is really strong considering how high we were. Really worth the visit', 'I went with my family in weekday...fantastic because it was not crowded The price is ₩27.000 about US$ 24 The best views in Seoul, we choose a clear day. Ideal to go in the afternoon to wait for the sunset and to take good photos. You can go up to a floor and then you have several floors to see and even 2 outdoor terraces Its a cafeteria and a nice shop where we bought a magnet!! Then when you go down I recommend to eat at the Mall, you have several options and for example \"On tge Border\", \"Pizza and Pasta\" or \"Hard Rock\"', 'I visited the Lotte Tower in early September and had a great view of the city on a beautifully clear day. The multiple observation decks and glass floors in certain areas make for an unforgettable experience. I got there shortly after the tower opened for the morning (10:00 AM) on a weekday and was able to purchase my tickets and go right up to the observation deck without any waiting.', 'I went to the top in the beginning of the evening. The view was clear and the city looks very impressive. Also stood on the glass plate at the 123st floor. There is also a sky lounge/restaurant where you can enjoy the view with a drink or diner. Romantic if you are with your partner, but not alone...', \"The tower was interesting to visit. We had coffee on the 123rd floor (rather expensive but basically lying for the view). The glass floor was cool. Overall I'd say the 5th tallest building in the world is definitely worth a visit.\", \"It offers good view of Seoul when it's good weather. Fastest elevator in the world. The pride of Seoul. Definitely it was good experience.\", 'I loved this mall! We spent an entire day there. There were two different sections. One had more high-end shops like Chanel while the other part had more affordable stores like Uniqlo. There were also lots of great food options. The only downside is that there are long lines for all of the restaurants. We had to wait 45 minute to be seated for dinner.', \"I took the Sky Shuttle to the top of the tower. It was not a very busy day for it, but they still packed you into the elevator like sardines. It would have been a much more enjoyable ride if they had 2 or 3 less people on the elevator. You literally have people pressing up against you on every side. Once we got to the observation deck I was disappointed to look out the glass and discover we were in the clouds, you couldn't see anything. It would have been nice if they had warned you before you bought your tickets that you wouldn't be able to see much. There were a couple small breaks in the clouds and you could see a little bit of the ground, but then all the rain running down the windows made good pictures nearly impossible. When it was time to line back up for the elevator to go back down, there seemed to be no order to the line, people were cutting the line, pushing & shoving. It would be a great experience on a nice day if the staff did a better job of managing the crowd.\", \"I went just to see the tallest building in Asia. I was gasping with joy as i experienced several floors, especially the see through glass floor. They did a wonderful job of creating different experience by integrating tech media. I didn't get to try yet but i heard their food somewhere in the middle of the tower is very good too. I will definitely try the restaurant when i go back.\", \"Super nice mall but seems all the doors are not wheelchair and stroller friendly. We have baby stroller and needed two of us to enter and leave to hold doors. Heard rumors from rich folks that this mall doesn't want handicap people to come! Go check out starfield Mall at goyang they have wide auto doors and western style mall.\", \"To be clear, the mall itself is not crowded, but the restaurants are overwhelmed with people. I was there around 7pm for dinner. There're so many exciting restaurants but they're all full. Queues looked like they're 40+ minutes. So I ended up with fried chicken and french fries, which I wasn't impressed.  I'd still give 5 stars and recommend everyone for a visit, but avoid peak hour if you want to dine here.\", 'It is worth to go there From the tower there is a magnificent view of Seoul and its surroundings. Unusual elevator to the top of the tower I would recommend to anyone no matter what age', 'There are too many people in this area. The mall is divided into luxury brand section and non-luxury brand section and basement restaurants are connected for hundreds of yards.  This place has Lotte theme park, subway station, Lotte Hotel, mall, and business district all connected into one place. It is a megs shopping district. On the 6th floor there is a movie theater.', 'This is a very beautiful modern building. There is a shopping complex under the tower, close to Lotte World. However the observation tower fees is just ridiculously expensive for the 5th tallest building in the world. I would save the money to visit the Burj. They have even a more expensive express ticket (approx 50 USD) which is crazy, but I guess they have done their statistics on this. It is however the tallest building in Korea and indeed you can see it from anywhere especially when coming into Seoul by land transportation.', \"My friends and I met at Lotte World Mall and spent our day walking around and dining. The mall is huge, right next to the tower and Lotte Department Store. There are many escalators and I especially like the express escalators which skip stores. 1000's of various stores, you can find anything and everthing. Lots of great restaurants and cafes. We ate at Spsin Club and had a lovely dessert at Guylian Chocolate Cafe. We didn't have time to visit the tower but will do so in September when we go bsck to the mall for out seafood dinner.\", 'I have spent some time photographing this building from different sides. It helps make a very good cityscape pics of Seoul. Best pics are made if you get to the hills south east of Seoul. I went with metro line number 5 to Macheon and then climbed the hills.', 'This mall houses a lot of things including Lotte World Adventure and the Seoul Sky, the newest skyscraper in Seoul which offers 360deg view of Seoul and the vertigo inducing transparent floor. Though more expensive than N-Seoul Tower, Seoul Sky is more superior and boasts of new interiors and less crowds. The entrance is designed with fantastic LED screens and the elevator is simply wow!', 'Located close to lotte world park. this area is full of LOTTE building and malls. big mall mostly expensive products. beautiful mall. good restaurant. you can visit this place after lotte world park.', 'We bought timed tix to see the sunset on the observation deck. Then we were able to walk around the Mall and mart and have dinner before. The way to the elevator is very cool and the elevator itself too. The observation deck is fun and the view is really great. It was not too crowded when we went since there are actually several floors to take in the view.', \"Came here (to Big Guy's Lobster) on Monday and had the grilled lobster and I have to say that it is easily some of the best lobster I've ever had; it's so good that it's comparable to high-end East coast Canadian lobster. I was greeted by Mike the manager and had a great conversation with him. He is fluent in both Korean and English so locals & international travelers wont have any trouble communicating with him if they have any modifications they wish to make or concerns about allergies and such. Lobsters are live and cooked in front of you. This is a must try if you're in Seoul & a seafood lover like myself. Don't miss this gem in the Lotte World Mall!  PS. Rest of the mall is also really great and is with checking out. There's something for everyone here.\", \"At the time of review, this is South Korea's tallest building and the world's 5th tallest building at 555m and 123 floors. Naturally, one would not want to miss out on an opportunity to stand at its observation deck on one of the top floors, and it is with this determination that I have to part with a fairly hefty KRW 27,000 entrance fees. The top draw in the observation deck is undisputedly the glass bottom which truly tests your fear for heights and is not for the faint-hearted. The 360 degrees view from the top is spectacular but only if the weather is permitting. The Lotte World Tower is attached to a modern shopping mall and an aquarium which will easily occupy your 1-day itinerary. Make no mistake, this towering skyscraper is the epitome of Seoul's push towards modernity!\", 'Lotte Tower can be found outside the Jamil Station that is also close to Lotte World amusement park. After buying the tickets, there is a short walk through a security check then into rooms and corridors that have great video and pictures on the walls and sometimes on the ceilings. The elevator/lift is rapid and also has a video display on the upper walls and ceilings. The view from the tower is spectacular even on a misty day like the day we went, There are more levels to go up and a small cafe that sells mostly ice creams. A great place to visit, if you have the time for some spectacular sights of Seoul and would be good around twilight.', \"Recently opened, with easy access from ticketing through to security! Didn't feel overly watched like I would in London, which made it a nicer experience. The views were absolutely incredible.\", 'The views are spectacular and with over four floors of observation area, there are plenty of different ways to overlook Seoul, including a glass walk and outdoor terrace. They offer a professional service which is reasonably priced and includes digital access (via download on computer or smartphone) with the purchase of any print. We went with our son who was two years old (children under 3 are free); he enjoyed looking out and walking around the observation area. We would highly recommend this attraction to anyone visiting Seoul.', \"Average views. Go there only if you are out of attractions to visit and if you are close by. It's kind of far from most other attractions.\", 'downstairs is the aquarium. great shopping in the mall with lots of places to eat. make sure you go to the observatory at the very top for spectacular views of Seoul !!', \"Good mall but the tower is the best part. Must do and take your time going to every floor. Cafe there to eat but we were there to watch a movie so didn't have time. The glass floor part is the best part.\", '4 floors 360 degrees of viewing space, cafe on 2 levels, 1 floor has 2 sections with glass floors, the floor above that you can go out side but the windows on the outside of the building are dirty but you still get a good views', 'Incredible building very nice surrounding area!  The building itself is spacious/state of the art in every way.  It is however expesnive and seems to be catering mostly towards those who are richer. Nothing wrong with that but for me I just walk around there.', 'Visited the recently opened mall. They have all your shopping needs inside. Also you can take magnificent photograph outside the building. There is a garden with a modern sculptor. Definitely will visit again as the building is massive and not enough time to walk around.', 'It opened not long ago and yet the windows were very dirty, so dirty that it shows on all the pictures. No restaurants up there yet, just some counter where you can buy some food and eat it while standing there with nowhere to sit. You go up, you look at the view, nothing else to do than go back down. The only cool thing is the glass floor in 2 place where you can stand on and see 1860 ft down.', 'Went there on a sunny Sunday afternoon. There were quite a lot of people in line at the ticket counters as expected, but since they were very efficient, we just waited for about 10 minutes until we got our tickets. Waiting time for the elevator was then another 15 minutes, which was faster then assumed too.  Adult ticket is 27.000 WON (~25 EUR/26 USD). Kids are about half price. There is also an Express-Ticket for 50.000 WON to pass the lines at the elevator etc.  Going up by the high speed elevator is nice and just takes a minute.  The multi-floor observation deck has a coffee lounge, photo stand, souvenir shop and two glass bottom areas. Also there are two outside terraces.  Plan to spend about 45 minutes there on the top of the tower, which is enough for sure to see everything.  The modern, elegant and big Lotte Mall itself is surely also nice to walk through, however we just went for the Tower.', 'This is a must to do, I highly recommend it. I visited around 10.30 in the morning and there where no lines at all. Also nice to sit at the bar and have a champagne. Employees very friendly.', \"This is one of the cleanest, largest, most varied shopping malls I have ever been to. Though I am not much of a shopper, I can appreciate the large variety of shops, entertainment and restaurants available here. The 5+ story mall is organized by type of shop, which is convenient. For example, there is a children's section with 15+ shops, luxury goods take up an entire floor, etc. There are also many electronic directory kiosks available on each floor to help you find things. The bottom floor has an excellent aquarium that would appeal to visitors of all ages. There are also many options for dining, both casual and fine restaurants. This is a great place to spend a rainy day exploring, shopping and eating. It is easily accessible through the Jamsil subway station.\", 'The experience in the elevator to 118 floor at high speed was exhilarating The glass bottom of the observatory tower is an interesting experience one should try standing on. The views were breathtaking; definitely a place worth a visit.', \"Very nice place it's a wonderful city full of all. Condition vivamente di visitors Seoul is beautiful city full of surprises.\", 'I visit this mall for shopping as we do not have time to joined it with the lotte world, there are lots of different products international and Korean brands each level specialized in certain things like most of Department store. The shopping there are tax free and that was plus. We enjoyed our dinner in Agra Indian restaurant and it was good.', 'We visited the new tower. The view of Seoul was amazing. The glass bottom observation deck was cool, but my girlfriend was too afraid to join me for a picture. :)', 'This was a decent tourist attraction, taking you to 5 stories of observation decks in the 5th tallest building in the world! Unfortunatately, Seoul is a bit hazy so even on te clearest day the view is not as impressive as it should be.', 'The Lotte World Mall is easy to reach via the Jamsil station of the Seoul metro. And the subway station is connected to the mall making the connection even easier. There are all kinds of stores and restaurants to spend your money including the nearby amusement park and the new Seoul Sky observatory.', 'Seoul Sky ( 123 levels ) which let us have a splendid view of the city right from level 120. Lucky us to enjoy 50% discount for the tickets on their first day of opening on 3rd of April. Else, adult tickets are priced @ 27,000 won for normal days. Only managed to get tickets to enter between 7 pm - 7.30 pm slot, so we saw the city night view in awe! The Sky shuttle that transported us to level 117 was intriguing, showing us how Seoul city landscape have changed over time. There\\'s outdoor access @ level 120 where we experienced strong gust of cold winds.  Photo taking provided by Seoul Sky @ ground level before we get to enter, which we can buy the hard copy later on. Maybe it was their 1st day of opening with the massive controlled crowds, it would have been better if they let us know we don\\'t look good in the photo and re-take another shot. Still we got the hard copies, 1st one for 12,000 won and the 2nd photo for an additional of 5,000 won. (Total of 17,000 won ). As at point of ordering photos, we could not see clearly from the computer screen if it was good either.  Explained from the fridge magnet which I had bought. - Lotte world Tower\\'s main motif is Korean traditional porcelain and brush. The tower\\'s appearance expresses \"the beauty of curve\" architecturally, with the design of becoming narrow as it goes high. Also the state of the art technique called \"diagrid structure\" is applied. Diagrid is a compound word of \"diagonal\" and \"grid\", the structure enhances the ability to endure typhoon and earthquake.  We saw the 11 mins of fireworks displayed on the night before grand opening which was memorable and a bonus point for our trip.', \"Seoul sky which is in the Lotte world tower opened on April 3rd 2017 and is the 6th tallest building on the world, and the tallest in Seoul. It's worth every penny of approx £19, $25 to go to,the observation deck 500 meters high. There are a couple of cafes and the upmarket 123 Lounge where a chicken sandwich costs 22000 won or approx £15 sterling and similar price for a Caesar salad. Both were presented beautifully and where else can you eat your lunch 500 metres above ground with fabulous views. The service was excellent, as was the experience. As this becomes more popular expect to queue to get your tickets. The mall at the basement goes to the 9th floor, has the usual range of very expensive shop, Chanel, Hermes etc There is also an aquarium, cinema and concert hall. There are also plenty of restaurants and cafes but don't expect them to be cheap.\", 'Just visited it 2017-04-08. I am usually not info writing any kind of reviews, but this time I had to. The place iš MUST visit for anyone who is visiting Seoul. The view, staff, everything is just perfect. Trip to observation deck cost ~25$ and if you are not sure if its worth it, or you are just poor student, skip your dinner but visit this place!! :-) Thank you Lotte for this experiance, this was amazing, good job :-)', \"I saw this building under Construction last Januaru 2015. And its finally finished. The Lotte World Tower is a 123-floor, 554.5-metre (1,819 ft) supertall skyscraper that finished external construction on March 17, 2016. The building's final 123rd floor was topped out on December 22, 2015. It is currently the tallest building in the OECD, and is the 5th tallest building in the world. A must visit when your in Korea\", 'C1 ( 2017.03.21 ) Though this shopping mall had trouble while building, but it was certain that there was very good landmark in this area after its completion. There had many stores, restaurant and things to do. I think there was the best place to shopping in Seoul.', 'Spent a couple hours here in October 2016. Came for dinner, then did some browsing. Very large mall with lots of stores including a high end department store. Many restaurants to dine at. Part of a conglomeration of many malls in this area. Easily accessible by metro. Has a theme park too called lotte world. Very bright, clean, and modern interior. Column fountains reaching from floor to ceiling of one of the mall floors that illuminated in a rainbow of colours. There are movie theatres as well. PF Changs is here and we had dinner there.', 'This is a very large mall with cinema on the 7 floor. It has two sections. One high end foreign brand and another mid and local foreign Brand’s.  There are the usual Zara and H& M which offer tax rebate to tourist. If you spent at the higher end Lotte world tower, the tax rebate counter closed at 8:30 pm- please note.  Do need to allocate at least 2 hours or more to Walk and browse at the items and shops.  We were here for a K pop < D O. From EXO > meet and greet after the movie- My annoying Brother. It was quite an experience following my teenager who was so firm and determined to see her pop star.', \"What I discovered was the Lotte World Tower over 550 meters or 1,800 feet! The architecture in the area was modern and unique. Just behind the world tower you can find Seokchon lake which has a walking track and you can appreciate the area from many angles. Had I known about this place I would have grabbed some food and a drink as there are many areas to sit. Lotte World Tower Hotel is in its final stages of construction and will eventually be linked to this Mall as well. The Lotte World Tower Mall is easily accessible by metro; it is right on top of the Jamsil Station which is a subway interchange between the green and pink lines. The pink line's Jamsil subway exits are linked to the basements of Lotte World Tower Mall itself which has a duplex hypermarket Lotte Mart and a duplex aquarium. The Lotte World Tower Mall main wing also hosts a department store, countless standalone shops and restaurants, a big cineplex (on its upper floors) and Hard Rock Cafe Seoul. The green subway line at Jamsil, and the Lotte World Theme Park across the road are connected to the high end wing Lotte Avenuel Mall. There is a several restaurants on the uppermost floors of Lotte Avenuel Mall that have an excellent view of Seokchon Lake and its surrounding park. An avid shopper will probably find it inadequate to spend an entire day exploring this sprawling 2-in-1 mega mall. The main wing of the Lotte World Mall has all the popular chain stores like H&M, Uniqlo, Zara, etc as well as branches of Korean cosmetic shops such as Etude House, Face Shop, Innisfree, Laneige, etc. I reckon the Lotte World Tower Mall will be a good place to escape from the scorching summer heat or freezing winter weather.\", 'Went here to catch lunch at the food court. The mall has lots of high end shops but the B1 floor houses affordable to mid range brands as well. They also have helpful directories near the escalators for tourists and those unfamiliar with the mall.  There are lots of choices for food and shopping. The restrooms are spacious and nicely equipped. The malls is fairly close to the subway station and has a taxi lane near the LV entrance/exit.', 'I hopped on the train for the day and randomly discovered this place as I missed my stop to see Olympic stadium at the sports complex stop. I entered an enormous mall and continued to walk until I was outside. What I discovered was the Lotte World Tower over 550 meters or 1,800 feet! The architecture in the area was modern and unique.

Couple of days are required if you want to shop and look around the place, Coex was like that before its renovation but now, I feel that Lotte world mall tower area replaced it. Even if the department store basement food court close around 20:00 or 20:30, other supermarkets are still open till midnight, If you go before closing, you can get very good quality food with discounted priace at the department basement.

Lots of high-end stores, brand-stores and international shops. There are not that many quaint or special shops. Would go elsewhere if your time in Seoul as a tourist is scarce. What we found terrible and rather disturbing (as Scandinavians) was the treatment of the animals in a pet shop. Small dogs in very small transparent boxes looked sad out of their cages. This is not a way to treat dogs - and we were amazed that this was possible at an international mall. Have never seen anything like it.\", \"Visited this mall with my boyfriend. It sells a lot of branded goods as well as other recognized (but more affordable) brands' goods. There are also a lot of restaurants and cafes in the mall. The goods sold range from clothings, bags, electronic devices, and many more. Visit this mall once, walk and look around it. You might find something you need.\"]\n"
