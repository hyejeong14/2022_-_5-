Seoul Tower is a famous landmark in Seoul, South Korea, from which you can overlook the cityscape of Seoul. If you want to go up, you can choose to take the cable car or walk. The cable car costs a fee, but it saves a lot of time and physical strength. There are many installation art around Seoul Tower, the most famous is the concentric locks for couples. Visitors can take pictures while looking at the city of Seoul, but the air quality in Seoul has been poor in recent years. I suggest checking the air quality before going up, otherwise there may be smog, and it will be uncomfortable to breathe and not be able to get a good view.  (Original) N Seoul Tower is a remarkable landmark where people can overlook Seoul City in Korea. Visitors can get there by tram or walking. Taking trams needs to pay the tickets, but it also saves lots of time and physical strength.  There are lots of installation arts around the tower plaza. The most famous arts is \"Locks of Love\". Couples will hang locks for symbolizing eternal love. Visitors can take pictures with arts and then see the whole of Seoul City. However, the air pollution in Korea has risen for years. I recommend people check the air pollution index before going to the tower or they might see the SMOG for taking poor pictures and uncomfortable respiration.  首爾塔是韓國首爾著名地標，可以在塔上俯瞰首爾都市景色。如果要上去的話可以選擇搭纜車或者是步行，搭纜車需要費用，但可省下不少時間跟體力。 首爾塔週邊有很多裝置藝術，最有名的是提供給情侶的同心鎖。訪客可以邊拍照邊看首爾市，但近年來首爾的空氣品質較差，我建議要上去之前可以看一下空氣品質情況，不然可能會有霧霾現象，呼吸不舒服也照不到好景色。', '', '', '(Translated by Google) Night view  (Original) 야경 좋죠', 'This is truly the heart of Seoul.
