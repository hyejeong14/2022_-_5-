0,Traveller of the world,4.0,"Not a must but worth stopping by if in the area.  I was doing the Seoullo 7017 walk.  Free.  This is one of the main gates of the Fortress Wall of Seoul.  After you have seen one, they all start to look the same.  What I did like though was the information boards (mainly photographs) showing how the gate had changed over the years.  In the early days, there was one photograph with a mode of transport (can't remember what it was) going under the gate and what appeared to be market stalls surrounding it.  Very different to now.  Looking at the gate you could imagine what it was like then, almost being transported to another era.  You don't need long, ten minutes at the most.  As I said, not worth a special trip unless your really into history and architecture.  If you come by subway from Seoul station, take exit 5 or you will walk all around.  Seoul station is one of the main stations and it's huge with multiple exits","Written May 31, 2022"

There was very good point to start Seoul tour, and Namdaemun traditional market was located beside this architecture.","Written December 20, 2020"
2,Janet1016,5.0,"One evening while walking around the Namdaemun Market looking for a place to eat dinner, we walked out a back alley and found the Sungnyemun Gate in all it's glory right across the street. It was surreal really, and a stunning piece of architecture.  Sungnyemun Gate (literally meaning 'the gate of exalted ceremonies') was built between 1396 and 1398 and has been repaired and restored on numerous occasions over the centuries. There used to be four main gates to the city (which used to be called Hanyang, and is now present day Seoul) We learned that if we came back the next morning that there was a 'Changing of the Guard Ceremony' performed for the Public. There is signage close by to tell you of the hours.  Sungnyemun Gate has a base of stonework with a half-round arch in the center and a gorgeous big door facing south. On top of that, there was a two-story wooden pavilion; the first floor of the pavilion was equipped with small doors on the east and west sides, and the second floor had wood-paneled windows on every side.  There are photos of the Gate taken after the Korean War when it had been damaged which are fascinating.  We showed up the next morning just in the nick of time. It was the end of January and there were only two other people there. The Guards are dressed in period uniforms from the Joseon Dynasty and it's really breath taking to get a sneak peek in to the past. A very nice security guard told us when we could approach and when we needed to stand back. They let us get up super close and I got some great photos. We were in Seoul during the Corona-virus scare so all the guards and staff were wearing masks.  We were in Seoul for a week and visiting this Gate and watching the Guard ceremony was definitely one of the highlights of our visit. (And it's free!!!!)  I love Changing of the Guard Ceremonies. I live in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada and have been to see the Changing of the Guard Ceremonies on Parliament Hill tons of times so it was really fun to get to compare with the Ceremony in Seoul. They too had a marching band!!!!","Written February 27, 2020"

4,ileannkneel,4.0,"The gate is right beside a 5 street intersection; the entrance to the gate is on the opposite side from the intersection. I wandered for a bit before finding it. Once in (which was quick as there is no admission and no one was around), it was quite impressive both to its sheer size and the fact that there is nothing preventing anyone form actually touching it. I would have thought that a national treasure such as this and being as old as it is, there would be heavy security and boundaries set so as to keep curious hands at bay. Not so. Feel free to touch away. And look up when passing through the gate. The murals in the ceiling are Sistine Chapel-like... ok, not really but still pretty cool.","Written December 6, 2019"

6,Nicholas D,4.0,"Just down the main strip from Gyeongbokgung Palace is a junction that spilts in several locations and in the middle of this junction is an ancient gate called ""Sungnyemun Gate"". It is part of the ancient city wall that surrounded the capital of Seoul in the Josean dynasty and is one of the oldest remaining features of the wall in Seoul today. It is a great place to visit on the way to Namdaemun Market and there are daily activities at the gate including Changing of the Guard ceremonies which occur daily every 2-3 times in the day. You can get some photos with the guards at the end of the ceremony which makes for some great holiday photos.","Written September 26, 2019"
7,Rumples,4.0,"Sungnyemum Gate, one of the four main gates in Seoul’s former fortress wall, dates back to 1398. But this South gate has been rebuilt many times with the latest completion occurring in 2013. I was exiting the Nandaemun Market at Gate 1 when I first saw the structure and wondered why it looked so new. Designated National Treasure No. 1, it stands across the street from the market on a big traffic island in a modern section of the city, known for its tall buildings. When I went to investigate, I was delighted to find free pamphlets in English that give the gate’s history from the Joseon Period until the present.  The gate features a stonework base, a two-tiered pagoda-shaped tile roof and a large archway in the center. A few guards in colorful traditional garb stood nearby and I soon heard distant drumming that came closer. It signaled the impending arrival of many men dressed traditionally in colors ranging from royal blue to bright yellow, complete with big hats and boots and carrying large flags. I had arrived in time for the free changing-of-the-guard performance at 11:40 a.m. Only a few others joined me, which was a welcome change from the huge crowds I encountered at similar productions held at Seoul’s palaces. After the short, less-than-10-minutes show, visitors could pose with the men for photos.  As a history buff, I really enjoyed my stop here and the lack of tourists. The gate stands between Seoul Station and Seoul Plaza. It can be accessed by Subway Line 1, Seoul Station, Exit 4 and Line 4, Hoehyeon Station, Exit 5. Closed on Mondays.","Written September 22, 2019"

There is a changing of the guard to add some colour (I missed it, but had previously seen the change at Deoksugung - its only a 10 min walk from Deoksugung to Sungnyemun). It's a good place to start a visit to the Namdeamun Market (there is an underpass from Sungnyemun gate to the top of the markets. Worth a quick stop and photo opportunity.

The gate can be reached from it's south side from near Namdaemun market and down a small road beside a mini-mart. The original gate was destroyed in a fire and this is the rebuilt one which is still very impressive. It is the Southern gate to the city of Seoul.  During my second visit, by luck actually, I was able to watch the changing of the guards which made the place a lot more special and allowed me to take fairly close up photos of the guards themselves. The guards do not mind photo taking although they will not allow you to get up in their faces the way the guards do outside Buckingham Palace.  At the entrance to the gate there is a small booth with an elderly gentleman and brochures freely available in several different languages. There are also public toilets here.","Written July 22, 2018"

But, the symbolic value is higher than any other landmarks. - Also known as Namdaemun literally meaning southern big gate.

The one remaining now is a modern work built after studying proofs. - Better to stay away when there's an event or a gathering. It will have a huge traffic around this area.","Written June 25, 2018"

70,Andrew M,4.0,"The south gate (Namdaemun) is probably the most impressive of all the Seoul Fortress gates. I had visited two years ago, and viewed the gate at night. It is much more impressive in the daytime. It was originally built in 1398. The gate was extensively damaged during the Korean War, and was repaired in 1961. The gate was damaged by arson in 2008, and reopened in 2013.  It may be easily accessed by subway line 4, Hoehyeon Station, exit # 5 or a 10 minute walk from Seoul Station, exit # 4. If using the Hoehyeon Station, the walk will take you through Namdaemun market which has great shopping. This route will take you to the rear of the gate, and it will be necessary to cross the road and walk around to the entrance of the gate. There is a changing of the guard ceremony sometimes that we were lucky enough to see and take photos with the guards.  This was our last stop on our day trip of visiting all the remaining gates of Seoul Fortress, and was probably the best way to end. Admission is free, and the gate is accessible from the front. There is a beautiful mural under the arch.","Written August 24, 2016"

There's a stamp challenge you can do if you visit all four former city gates (for the cardinal directions). Pick up a sheet at the visitor center and get your first stamp right outside (ask if you can't find it). Great idea!

I absolutely love how they restored it by mixing in neat modern white-ish materials on the edge with the antique actual door at the middle. What's fascinating about this neighborhood (besides the door) is that it is so diverse. You're a couple of minutes away from Seoul Station, the ultramodern City Hall, the old Deoksogung palace, the traditional Namdaemun market, decrepited smaller houses on the South Side, and sky-reaching glass buildings on the North End. This place is really central to Seoul and Korea, and the fact that cars swirl around the door only reinforces the sentiment that Sungnyemun is really the heart of the city of Seoul.","Written May 22, 2015"
