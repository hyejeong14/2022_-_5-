166,5.0,Excelente experiencia
167,3.0, Too many people but pretty A good place to take a night view 
168,3.0,"It's a nice clean stream in the middle of a bustling city. Relaxing place to take a stroll but IMO, not work going out of your way to see it."
169,5.0,"We walked part of the stream on our way from Changdeokgung Palace to City Hall. As a tourist, not something you’d make a special trip to see but worth walking through if you’re in the area."
170,5.0,"Renovated stream through downtown Seoul with walkways, sitting areas, nice lighting. Popular with tourists and locals, couples on dates and office workers wanting a ""nature break."" Easy access from several downtown subway stops and worth and hour stroll."
171,5.0,"This was just stunning.  I went at dusk.  Even though it was slightly chilly with light rain, the atmosphere and setting were just magical.  The lights and skyscrapers, the couples sitting by the stream or families and friends catching up, whatever the occasion it was the atmosphere, vibe and setting that just captured my heart.  Loved it.  I took a slow stroll from one end to the other and back.  There are some information boards which are really interesting to read giving you some facts about the stream and the surrounding area.  This is a must for any trip to Seoul.  I was lucky the evening I was there, the sky turned this stunning colour with the dark grey clouds and purple sunset. Suggest going in the early evening. There are a few places nearby to grab a drink or bite to eat after.  "
172,5.0,Quiet and easy to navigate during our morning run along the stream. It’s a morning stroll location for locals as well. Good route for city runs for first time visitors.
173,5.0,"Cheonggyeacheon is the first of the stream beds to be restored and is a pleasant walk through downtown Seoul. Birds have returned as well as some small fish. it is about five miles long wandering through downtown. It is a prototype of all the other successful stream bed parks across Korea,"
174,5.0,"Clean, calm streams for walk. Love this place again. Evening is better to walk after dinner. Recommend."
175,5.0,Unfortunately this year no Christmas lights which last year were stunning but still a nice walk in the evening along the river.
176,5.0,"This area is picturesque and pretty for a stroll. At night, lights are switched on and very colourful."
177,4.0,"Visiting Cheonggyecheon is a must if you go to Korea. It's an 11 km long modern stream that runs through downtown Seoul. The stream starts from Cheonggye Plaza, a popular cultural arts venue, and passes under more than 20 bridges before flowing into the Hangang (River), with many attractions along its length."
178,5.0,its great a small river in the middle of the city. You can sit and put you food in the water and drink something and relax during your trip.
179,5.0,"From a walking distance of Jonggak station you will found Cheonggycheon stream. It’s a 10 km long modern public space in downtown Seoul. It’s a great place to chill and get away from the city's fast paced life. Depending on the time of the year, there’s different exhibitions. It’s definitely good place for pictures."
180,5.0,"Best time to go there at night. When we went there, it was around the Christmas season and the stream is adorned with colorful lanterns. Very festive!"
181,4.0,"Beautiful little stream with people walking and jogging around. However if you go there during the night, it can be a bit scary as the street light is not much in terms of quantity and brightness. But don't worry as local people here are very nice and friendly. It is also peaceful to walk during the night."
182,5.0,for decades it was a huge hideous overpass but is now a nice modern park thanks to president lee myung bak. i guess that's an improvement
183,5.0,"Peaceful little stream in the middle of the busy city! There's something that happens when you walk down those steps and get next to the stream. All of a sudden, you're not in a busy city. You're strolling along a peaceful stream. Beautiful spot"
184,5.0,"Very fun detour from the middle of a crowed city. We were there on New Years Eve so it was quite crowded, however I have been before and it is a nice place for a break."
185,4.0,"We stumbled onto this stream by chance when we were touring the Myeongdong shopping area. This is a delightful stream that runs about 10 kilometers through pretty much downtown Seoul. I understand that prior to 2005, the stream was polluted. So now this area has been cleaned up and converted into an art and nature walkway. It is a wonderful area to walk along the stream. It is a relaxing stroll, has nice greenery and art work along the way. You can even cross over onto the other side where there are stepping stones. I would say it is a nice area for city workers to have lunch in, great for families and romantic couples alike."
186,5.0,It is quite nice man made attraction at the middle of the city. People just walk along the stream enjoying scenery.
187,5.0,This stream is beautiful and offers a nice reprieve from the hustle of the city. Go at night to see it lit up.
188,5.0,"You won’t miss this if you’re walking from kwangjang market. Pop by for a quick photo, beautiful reflection of the sky in the stream."
189,5.0,"in the midst of tall buildings, and city noise, this is a true peaceful oasis, with ti s cute colorful umbrellas and art display installations,and peaceful water sounds. very sweet and beautiful spot."
190,3.0,"We stayed in the Myeongdong shopping area, and walking to the stream was only 5-mins away... north of the Line 2 (green) subway station. We went there at night after dinner, and it was very tranquil. There were sections along the stream where you can cross over to the other side via big stones/boulders. If you come in November, there will be the lantern festival going with nice lanterns to see. We didn't get to see this, but it was still a nice walk along this stream, with some artwork along the walls (when you walk under bridges)."
191,5.0,"Felt very safe here walking at night. It's a nice date activity. The lights are pretty, and it's a comfortable walk."
192,4.0,"During Christmas time (and New Year time), this area was changed as a new city/world within the city. It's was like enjoying a special moment/time within the real time. Time stopped for a while, the time for appreciating all surrounding and glancing things. Really nice and still sounds like a small dream in my mind."
193,5.0,Went at evening to see the lanterns on the stream. It was breath taking.We took many photos and marvelled at the beauty of the lanterns. It is a lovely walk also in the day time. Great to stop along the walk and find a place for food.
194,4.0,"We took a quick stroll with the kids before sunset, when it gets cold.  The lanterns were not lit up but it was a refreshing quick stroll. I bet it's even lovelier during summer.  One of the more relaxing area in this busy city."
195,5.0,Clean and well main-maintained stream in the bustling city. A lovely and beautiful place to relax and unwind.
196,4.0,We visited in the evening of Christmas Day. There is a lot of people as expected. The stream is being decorated with beautiful lights. People are taking photos along the way and above at street level. Unfortunately some rude Korean speaking ladies ruined the evening as they kept pushing and squeezing towards the railings for their photos while our girls were taking theirs. Could have been a five-star experience.
197,3.0,"Second time visiting, but first time with my teen so wanted to show her, it was interesting to walk in this stream but we went there at about 6pm and it was pret dark and there was no activity nor christmas nor year end lighting so we didnt stay long and left."
198,5.0,"Really great place, superbly lit for Xmas. Very popular and thus quite busy. You can walk a good 5km or so and there are a numbee of displays along the way."
199,4.0,"I like to come here at night as it is always lit up with pretty lanterns and with the water gently flowing it provides a nice distraction and break from the hustle and bustle of the city.  On the roads either side there are a number of coffee shops, restaurants and other points of interest."
200,3.0,"I walked almost the complete length and back of the stream. It was winter and during the morning hours so there were few people, no night lighting or street food stalls and alas the plants were not looking their best in the cold. It’s a nice walk, but nothing exceptional. Maybe during spring/summer and at night the place would be more spectacular."
201,5.0,"It was a nice stroll after food at Kwangjang market, walk all the way to dongdaemun. The kids enjoyed the stroll."
202,5.0,"It was having christmas theme, so the stream is decorated accordingly. A good stroll to take after having lunch."
203,5.0,A very beautiful place to visit for mind refreshments. Nice place to hang out at the evening. Superb place for photo shoot.
204,3.0,Just another stream to me. Maybe i did not spend enough time there. Ok to have a look but nothing to wow about in my opinion.
205,5.0,"I was lucky enough to walk half length of the stream walk of about 16 points/6km. The waterfall at the start of the adventure led to multiple stepping stone crossings from side to side, abundant fish and bird life as well as beautiful trees. Bridge architecture varies at each station, some of which provide cultural stops to admire under-bridge art galleries, ceramic tile displays of historical events and unobscured views of modern buildings reaching the skies all around. The 13th station led to Gwangjang market, the biggest and oldest example still operating. The night excursion following the stream changes aspect with the addition of myriad illuminations and light displays. Locals and tourists alike enjoy this experience on a daily basis."
206,4.0,"It's a cute and artistic way of making an inevitable water course into a nice attraction. Maybe not so much in winter when I was there but probably a nice cooling respite from the high-rise buildings all over Myeongdong especially in summer. I used it as a marker to guide me through that part of the city, it is prominent on any map and helped me find my way."
207,4.0,"I understand this stream is a recent transformation and what a great idea it was. As it is below street level, the noise and din of the great city is greatly diminished and while walking a portion we saw a heron fishing, catching, and eating a meal of fish. Way cool. Very few major world cities have this feature as part of the downtown core. Seoul stands out and gets major points with the addition of this small but natural respite from the craziness all around. 4 stars."
208,3.0,pretty average attraction with a proper sidewalk at both banks of the stream for visitors to stroll along
209,5.0,Do find some time to stroll the length of this cool stream that cuts the city. You will feel as though you have detached from the hustle and bustle of the city. Several subway stops will lead you here. Check it out if feel that the city is getting to be too much!
210,4.0,"Very often, after long air-travel, one needs an outdoors option for a fast walk, and this nice stream, well hidden from noise of traffic, is an ideal place."
211,5.0,It was a great/beautiful walk down the stream i usually dont walk around but i appreciated this beautiful scene i embraced it and will do it again.
212,4.0,"Magificant light festival along the river, whenever you go to Seoul it’s akways worth checking what’s happening on the river. Lots of bars and restraints nearby"
213,4.0,Great river walk. Went after dinner and everything was lit up. Every block had different art pieces. My favorite was the lantern section. Got a bit overcrowded in some areas and not as many stairs back up as I would of thought
214,4.0,"I went to this place a few times in the past. At night the waterfall was lit up beautifully. On the weekends there were many hawker stalls selling food, etc. This year there was a lantern show and the place was unusually crowded."
215,5.0,This was a very great use of space to add something natural but man made. It gives back to nature in a concrete world.
216,5.0,"Was brought by relatives to visit this beautiful place. Caught by great surprise with the amazing landscape along the stream. We happened to chance upon 2019 Seoul Lantern Festival in Nov. There were so many featured lanterns, each lantern has a story behind it which are very interesting for visitors to enjoy reading them while walking along the river. Took us about 20 to 30 mins as we were enjoying & strolling slowly with a toddler.  And there’s also water laser show around 9pm which drawn a lot of tourists and local visitors too. During one part of the stream, you can opt to place a floating lantern with light costing krw 5000, saw many young couples and families doing this for fun as well as for goodwill blessings.  I think this place is very romantic too as we can take many lovely pics in the evening with all lighted lanterns as backdrop. What’s more fun is you can step on the rocks in the river to cross over the other side. This is something really quite interesting. We walked from Jongno-5-ga all the way Euljiro-1-ga station back to our hotel. Definitely recommended for those first timers and returned visitors. Will be back again next time I visit Seoul again. Thumbs up!!"
217,3.0,I thought we would use the stream a lot to get from A to B and avoid the busy streets and traffic but turned out it is just that bot too far south of the main areas to be that useful. Looks pretty though.
218,4.0,"We enjoyed walking along the paths by the stream, both in the day and at night. There are lots of interesting features (stepping stones, fountains, artworks, benches with sunshades, etc) that make it a lovely way to get between places or just stroll. It felt very safe at night, and at the western end especially there were lit up fountains & waterfalls, etc. The musical fountain light show was a surprise at 7.30pm & very good."
219,3.0,"The stream is a good way to travel across the city, away from the heavy traffic and need to wait at pedestrian crossings. At places it is quite colourful and pretty at others it's a bit more neglected. It is a safe way to get around and features labels and access steps to the various roads it passes beneath."
220,5.0,"Located in the Centre of the metropolis, the walkway gives a sense of calmness from the fast paced city. No festivities while I was here but I’m sure events would be well decorated."
221,4.0,Such an interesting stream and atmosphere running through the city. Although the stream is in the heart of the city it is such a pleasant place to rest. You will see business people and tourist alike relaxing and enjoying the sounds and sights of nature...taking a break from their day. Love the green umbrella installation and also the spot where you throw the coins in. my kids loves running up and down and crossing over the water on the large rocks.
222,5.0,"Nice, cool, clear, and clean stream. Families would come with their children or dates. The place is very clean, well-maintained, a lot of small fish, to be enjoyed by all ages.  There was a safety traffic event at the end by the waterfall / filter that we were able to join and enjoy. They say sunsets are nice here; I think so too.  Tents were set-up by the time we left; around 3PM but given a choice, I would have stayed much longer."
223,5.0,We walked here early evening and it was great. A few people but quiet. Art displays in some sections and a laser show as well. Up top were stalls selling street food. Walked about 3km.
224,3.0,"Was totally blown away with this ""new"" attraction when i chanced upon it 5 years ago. Its still nice, but i suspect the landscaping & other exhibits seems to have suffered from maintenance budget constraints.  I did manage to visit the Cheongyecheon museum. Great place to spend an hour or two. A bit difficult to get to since there's no metro station nearby, but easy enough by taxi or bus. (Get your ""free"" costume picture taken at the photo machine near the entrance door on ground floor. They can even email the picture to you, though for some reason, it does not work for gmail. My friend got his photo on yahoo mail.)"
225,5.0,I walked a number of miles by the side of the stream and it really is a delight. As one is sunk below the road it's very quiet and allows one to take a breath and relax in a city that is constantly loud and moving. Even after dark I wandered here as there are groups sitting and chatting or couples wandering hand-in-hand. Worth a trot along even if briefly just to restore equilibrium
226,4.0,"Nice place for an early evening walk. Set beneath street level, so on hot days it remains cool. Well laid out walking paths make it easy to navigate. If you staying in central Seoul worth taking a walk in the evening before or after diner."
227,5.0,"Great view for refreshing , weather is good, water is cold, there is a fish .Some street singer is playing some korean songs."
228,5.0,Lightings and umbrella decorations are very unique about this place. You can scroll along the stream while enjoying the night view and try some street food stalls. Must visit place in Seoul.
229,5.0,"My recommendation is to devote a good few hours to walk through it from the starting point (The big blue & red shell statue. IDK the name, it was all in Korean 😅)"
230,5.0,It is a canal walkway below road level with running water in the middle. Pedestrians are evacuated when the water level upstream is too high and needs to be released into the canal thus flooding the canal and the pedestrian path on both sides of the canal. There are plenty of greenery as well as benches and nice theme sections at different sections of the canal. A good relaxation and exercise stretch when in the dongdaemun shopping area. Worth a visit.
231,4.0,"Took a walking tour along the Chonggyecheon Stream. A nice peaceful walk starting from Gwanghwamun and ended at Dondaemun. Near Dondaemun you can have some lunch at the traditional Gwangjang market. If you want to have some peace from the busy CBD, you can find it walking along the Chonggyecheon stream."
232,5.0,"This stream is a nice place to relax and take a walk in Seoul. Can sometimes get crowded on the weekends, but it's a nice natural space in the middle of the city."
233,3.0,Nice way to get from point A to B without the noise or stress of street traffic. I applaud the city for the effort undertaken to make this a nice place to walk but the landscaping/brush is now getting out of control. The out-of-control plants are distracting.
234,3.0,"The stream is nice but may not worth the effort to go to visit it. If you happen to be near it, go there and you will find you can take some nice photo there. We went to the part of it which is near the Dongdaemen Design Plaza. Not a bad idea to go if you have the time."
235,5.0,Must see! In middle of crazy shopping there is a great restored stream. Beautiful access and tranquil area. Worth stopping and seeing fish with a coffee!
236,5.0,"This stream in the middle of the city is just wonderful. With walking paths on both sides, and stepping stones to cross the water, it is perfect for a walk or run. We are staying at a hotel nearby, so we have taken several walks here, both during the day and in the evening. Highly recommended!"
237,5.0,"A stream right in the middle of the city , make the city so relaxing and beautiful, we spend about an hour just sitting by the river stream listening to the flow of water and taking photo"
238,4.0,This is a lovely part of town to get some atmosphere and have a short walk. Nice fountains and stepping stones along the way.
239,5.0,"A 10 km stream in the city of Soul offers relax for everybody - healing stress, cooling area, reading, nature lovers - simply enjoy it."
240,5.0,"In the middle of the city is the Chenggyecheon stream which is a river pathway that starts from the centre of Seoul and can take you beyond Dongdaemun Market and further east of the city. It is a pathway full of interesting natural and man-made features including many bridges, trees, hedgerows and more. The stream is also full of Art installations which catch the eye and at night time parts of the stream contain light shows that help keep the river area active during the night with revellers, tourists and even locals just looking for an area to relax or exercise. If you have a few hours to spare on your journey I recommend walking this riverpath to a location in the city like Dongdaemun Market or Insadong Shopping area."
241,5.0,Great to final see this restoration in person. Great rewinding. Herons in the middle of a mega city!
242,5.0,"A fascinating place. I'm impressed by the effort and resources Seoul invests on city beautification, cultural and historic preservation projects. Who would have thought that this stream was once paved over and was a major road. Its actually really nice and I know it reaches all the way to Dongdaemun. If I had time, I'd walk further and enjoy the diversity and culture. Its a great place yo go at night. Great for social gatherings, dates and running."
243,5.0,"The stream walk was conveniently located near our hotel. We loved walking it, it truly helped with our jet-lag.  The walk way is peaceful, there were people of all ages. Couples, lingering off to the side spending quality time together, walkers of all different levels.  Cool and crisp in the evening (end of September)...just below the streets, you are not interrupted by cars/street lights."
244,5.0,Seoul created an oasis with their construction of this river walk.The section we visited was lovely and being enjoyed by many on a very warm day.
245,3.0,"We walked past Cheonggyecheon stream to get to Gwangjang market and it seemed to be quite unkempt. Heard from my Korean friends that during winter there are lighting decorations, guess it’s the wrong season to visit."
246,5.0,"Great idea in the middle of a big city. A shallow stream where you can sit, soak your feet and socialize with friends and family."
247,5.0,"A must see place in Korea, it is located in the middle of tall buildings but it’s amazing how they preserve the place. It is indeed so rich in culture. A huge place to visit. You need at least half a day to visit all the sites in the palace. When you wear the hanbok costume, the entrance is free."
248,4.0,"If you are searching for a place to chill in Seoul. this is the right place. Here you can relax, get your feet wet and enjoy the calm of this area. Have a walk through Seoul along the banks of this stream is a must-do activity. The stream is pretty long (about 11 km): we walk until the Dongdaemun Design Plaza. Perfect time, in my opinion, is late afternoon, before the sunset!"
249,5.0,"A narrow water stream, nice to walk next to it or chill for a bit. Its nice in the morning and night too."
250,5.0,"In the high rising buildings , you can find these kind of natures. Good to go and stay in downtown and walk by the river."
251,5.0,"Cheonggyecheon Stream runs through the heart of the old city of Seoul, running almost East-West between a bit past the East Gate (Dongdaemun) to the West Gate (Soedaemun)...Its western end starts just a short way from the Gyeongbok Palace, while it's eastern end is very near and accessible to the Dongdaemun fashion district with its newest attraction, the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, by the late Architect, Zaha Hadid.  The stream itself runs below the level of adjacent streets, so the experience focuses more on the nice landscape and waterscape treatment of the stream itself, which has evolved from being an underground sewer/canal roofed by a highway in the 1960s, until its current reincarnation as an interesting urban design element to modern day Seoul circa 2005...or sometime around then.  A series of pedestrian and vehicular bridges cross over the stream. It's nicely lit at night so even an evening stroll is pleasant. However, during storms or periods of monsoon rains, the stream also functions as flood control infrastructure, so best to check first for warnings or alarms before descending.  The stream is bounded by a variety of facilities, including hotels, restos and bars, as it traverses the Myeongdong, Jongno and Dongdaemun districts, so if your walk makes you hungry or thirsty, just get back up to street level for that snack, meal or drink."
252,5.0,"This river is beautiful, at night and daytime. There are a lot of diffrent events around here which makes a visit more fun."
253,4.0,Seoul does not have many green spaces in its center - so it is pleasant to descend from busy streets to the river promendade.
254,5.0,It's a beautiful stream right in the middle of downtown Seoul. I've been there several times. Both day and night. During the day it's a great place to take a relaxing break while sightseeing in the downtown area. It's below street level which keeps down the street noise. You almost forget you're in the city. I especially like it after dark. It's a great place to sit and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere. It's lit with colored lights and images projected on the walls. There are many bars and restaurants in the nearby neighborhood so you can eat then take a relaxing walk along the stream or just sit and listen to the burbling water.
255,4.0,This stream was once clean or concrete however trees and shrubs have been allowed to grow with a noticeable change since I first came to Seoul in 2009.  The stream has a walking path close to the stream with stairs coming down to stream level.  I’ve been here before during the evening and it does attract a lot of locals walking along its course.  Nice to see.
256,4.0,"The stream is a place where you can relax, especially on a warm day.  Grab some drinks and food and then just chill. We were there on a Sunday when there were musicians and market stalls close by. The stream starts next to a very cool sculpture and rainbow coloured building - a good landmark to look for."
257,3.0,"The famous stream was next to our hotel and of course having seen it in so many korean drama, we had to take a look. It was just a stream and on a hot summer day, many tourists were seen soaking their feet in the water. Nothing much to do here."
258,3.0,Go in the evening as we went in the afternoon in summer and it is too hot  Would he a great place at night and cooler time
259,5.0,"Cheonggyecheon Stream is an excellent example of urban restoration. The stream was underground, but now all the covers have been removed and the stream uncovered. Riverside paths have been built and a riverside park established, alongside engineered meanders and stepping stones. When we were there the riverside paths were closed due to potential flooding, but the stream is still visible from the roads above. There is a sculpture marking the spring at the start of the stream."
260,5.0,".a cool lovely place to stop, rest, relax and take some pictures . pretty cute basically, not a must if you're in a hurry"
261,5.0,"The Cheonggyecheon Stream eventually finds its way to the Hahn River a major waterway that divides Seoul into north and south sectors. The stream is the back drop for many a festival. I've been there several times. The first time during the Christmas season and was there for a lantern festival that set up along the stream. Well worth the visit to enjoy the charm and ingenuity of the Korean people. I lived in Korea for seven years and love the Korean people and the Korean friends I made there, I hated to leave. Korea doesn't have a shortage for festivals. There is always a festival you can find. The Cheonggyecheon Stream is a short walk from the subway and again there are plenty of restaurants to eat and drink at nearby."
262,4.0,"A peaceful place to rest after a long walk in Seoul or shopping. Quiet, cool. Moving east, you can walk to Dongdaemun shopping districts, a traditional market."
263,5.0,"It was so funny but memorable finding this place. We were at a shrine and we somehow can't direct where this stream is. An old Korean Lady guided us to this stream. It was just a 10 minute walk all along. When I saw the clear water with some fishes in it, you could tell that the water is clean. It sure love to dip your feet in it....I love this place. I would be glad to visit this again because it is an 11 km stream."
264,5.0,This is a fascinating walk which allows you to see a very busy and built-up city through the eyes of the past and gives you time to reflect. A wonderful afternoon's walk which also makes sure you reach the 10000 steps needed per day and then some.
265,5.0,"Strolling along the stream in the evening was our favorite experience in Seoul! What a pleasant setting filled with people enjoying the city. It seems to go on for miles, so you can walk as long or as short as you would like. Until you take the steps down to the stream, you won't get a sense of the place, which is a refuge from the busy city surrounding it."
266,4.0,Good place to take a rest after walking around the city. You can see some fishes and creative graffiti. Also there are so many bugs and mosquitoes.
267,5.0,"My Korean friends have told me that Cheonggyechon Strean is exclusively for couples, but is not the case, of course, you will see couples walking around and having a romantic moment but you can go check out the stream with friends and family too. The best thing is you can take off your shoes and dip your feet in the stream. Since is summer, many people go there and they bring their snacks and beer to have a relaxing moment. Here is where the lantern festival takes place in November, if you are in Korea around that time I highly recommend you to check it out. You won't get disappointed."
268,5.0,"Such a relaxing walk in the midde of the city, very peaceful with fish and storks, can walk from Gwanghwamun square to at least Dongdaemun."
269,5.0,"Cheonggyecheon stream is an excellent experience. We dip our feet there and it was very relaxing. The water flow was pretty hard, so no one dared to cross the stream, even though it wasn't deep and was not a long way to cross. We threw some coin inside the well. My daughter successfully threw one inside. We stayed there for 30 minutes. It was the best foot therapy ever."
270,5.0,Nice place and weather. Lots of people enjoying summer time. feeding the fish and cycling along the river. will come back again during autumn
271,3.0,"A quaint and quiet walkway in city center, especially near Eulgi-ro and Dongdaemun. My husband, daughter and I were relieved to stroll along this tiny stream after a hectic meal in the Gwangjang Market, where we ate the famous Bindaetuk and Kalguksu. Actually we bought some Yut, or korean taffy, at the market and ate them while walking. There was a street concert going on, but kind of 60s style."
272,5.0,Great example of incorporating nature in the city buildings. Great place to chill out and relax. Many local soak their feet in the crystal clear river water to cool themselves. Crane was spotted in the river fishing for food. River is not deep probably just ankle or knee deep water level. Very calming place to get away from the city buzz and just pass your evening away.
273,4.0,"This is a 10 km long modern stream that runs through downtown Seoul. I walked a portion of the stream, from Gwangjang Market to Dongdaemun during a weekday afternoon. It was rather quiet, with a few locals sitting along the bank to relax and chill. I suppose it is livelier in the evening."
274,3.0,I didn't know what was the big deal when everyone told me I have to visit the steam. It's a very long walk until the end of the stream - you don't have to walk all the way. The view is better in the evening. Apparently it used to be road. And the government decide to make it a stream. I think that's a fantastic idea! I appreciate the stream even more
275,5.0,Very nice to walk or have early morning jogging. Nicely and thoughtfully decorated. Highly recommend to have walk through.
276,5.0,"This is one of the best walks in Seoul. You can follow yhe stream, make stops below or above ground to do a variety of things. Or you can find a spot relax, and get away from the city while being in the center of it."
277,5.0,"Loved taking a leisurely stroll along this urban creek. Its highly developed and right in the middle of the city, plenty of performers and couples dot the shore well into the evening. Though access down to the shore could be easier, as there are specific points you can use, because it's below street level."
278,4.0,"When shopping in Myeongdong, take 5 minutes to walk down the stream for a mindfulness moment (and great photo ops). I wouldn’t say it’s a must do when in Seoul but it is lovely."
279,4.0,"When Seoul is hot and the traffic and confusion on the streets is too much to bear, just find the steps (or occasional elevator) which lead to the cool, quiet Cheonggyecheon Stream. You can wander from City Hall all the way to Dongdaemun Square and along the way enjoy the ceramics depicting ""King Jeongjo's Procession to the Royal Tomb."" And if you find yourself missing the noise and confusion, just take the next flight of steps back up to ground level."
280,4.0,Was walking around Dongdaemun at night and almost missed this place cos you will think it is just a simple canal. Get closer and it is more than that. I know the history of this place and that it was once very polluted and unsightly. Amazed at its renewal. Wish I could see this place in the daytime but it was still well lighted with various water features at late evening.
281,4.0,"Started from the start and walked about 4 kms. The first few hundred meters are excellent, after that there was the prominent smell of sewer gas. Nevertheless, better than walking on the street."
282,4.0,This is an amazing urban renewal project turning an otherwise unsightly drain into a beautiful stream and park. The water looked shallow and clean. Both sides of the pedestrian walkway were well paved and landscaped.  We approached Cheonggyecheon after exiting Dongdaemun metro station. It was close to midnight on a week night: there were some people sitting by the stream and a few joggers. Absolutely peaceful and such serenity compared to the noisy traffic above.  A fantastic place for a leisurely stroll in the evening.
283,5.0,"I went there around 6.30 pm so that I had an hour walking along, and then saw the sky changed its colour"
284,5.0,Love the atmosphere. There are plenty of things to see. Would like to go back again if I have chance
285,4.0,So a concrete overhead highway was removed and the stream below restored to create this urban oasis in the heart of a busy city. What a tranquil respite to go for a walk along this water. It runs for several miles going under bridges and there's some neat artwork along the way. Good for a day or nighttime stroll.
286,5.0,"The most beautiful spot in Seoul. Took the metro from Myeongdong to Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station, exited at Exit #1; walked past the futuristic Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) designed by Zaha Hadid; and crossed the street to the stream entrance. Immediately we were entranced by the greenery and quiet. There were only a few tourists, walkers, and locals starting their day. It was a refreshing contrast to the hustle and bustle of Myeongdong and all the other touristy areas we visited (e.g., N Seoul Tower). Total distance back to Namdaemun-ro and Myeongdong was less than 2.5 miles; under an hour."
287,3.0,I was really looking forward to seeing this stream but when we got there was a bit disappointed. No art to be seen - just a few traffic cones! Glad we saw it though and still cool to have a stream in the middle of the city that is peaceful.
288,5.0,"Man made, below street level stream. After a long, hot day of walking, it was nice to dip our feet in the cold stream to cool off. It could be better maintained in terms of trash and weed removal. It was cool to see a heron stalk and pluck a small fish out of the water and eat it whole."
289,4.0,Our family visited this stream and enjoyed the photo moments. We enjoyed our stroll along the stream. It was a short and easy stroll for us. A worthy experience for my family.  This stream is walking distance from the Lotte Department Store. It is easily accessible by public transport. There is also a mega Muji Shopping Mall near it.
290,5.0,It's pretty picturesque during the day then at night with the lighting it gives it another just as picturesque side. Cool to just wander along with plenty to look at along the way. Also worth joining the Spooky Side of Seoul tour which takes in part of the stream and gives some interesting history if you're a lover of the macabre.
291,5.0,Love how they converted this stream into a nice park and place to rest and relax for the people and visitors to Seoul. I hope they maintain it as just a park and not be invaded by commerce. Its a much nicer stroll at night .
292,4.0,It is indeed a place worth visiting. We strolled along the stream and stopped to sit at the side to enjoy the breezy wind and get some sunlight during the spring season. Don't forget to bring some titbits and a bottle of hot tea with you at your next visit.
293,5.0,"We came here on an evening and the scenery was quite beautiful. The wind was blowing it was a bit cold, but nevertheless we had a pleasant time relaxing at the stream enjoying the murals and the flow of water across the stream. The kids enjoyed this stream so much as well. Truly recommend this spot to those who loves peace and tranquility."
294,5.0,"People like to strolling around the stream, especially on summer. You have to be careful on rainy days because the stream will be closed to prevent the floods."
295,5.0,"Its a very long stream stretch few KM. Along the stream you can find nicely placed stepping stone, nice and calm small water stream, underneath water fixture, and most importantly, its clean.. Lot of Koreans can be spotted having good and romantic time.. There are lot of entries to this place, may google for the suitable exit from metro station from your hotel. It is very impressive how korean people built this and make a small water stream as one of tourist spot just to have relaxing night. The idea very smart"
296,5.0,"We were here first at night, and everything was decorated with lanterns because of Buddha's birthday, so it looked really awesome. But also during the day, it's a nice place to take a walk."
297,4.0,What a great illustration of the talent and commitment of the korean people. Turning an old piece of infrastructure into this amazing public space. Could not believe how clean it was and how big the fish we saw in there were ~ 1 to 2 feet
298,4.0,It was a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the surrounding markets. There was a water fountain.
299,4.0,"My hotel, the VenueG, fronted onto this restored stream. It was a convenient riverwalk type park that ran right into the heart of Seoul and within sight if the main square and the Palace. There were fish in the stream and it was quite a little oasis of quiet in an otherwise chaotic area. I found it very useful navigating in reference to it as it was conspicuous on the maps and easy to find by street. There was a very cool ornament at the downtown end and there was a large tourist centre as well."
300,4.0,This is a relief in the bustle of the town. A nice walk along a stream with waterfalls and many plants and trees.
301,3.0,If you’re out of things to do this a nice break from the commotion. It’s a peaceful area to walk in. With flowers and a stream. They turned an old canal in to a lovely walking park.
302,5.0,"Nice to escape to this perfect place and stroll the full length at whatever pace takes your fancy. Take in the atmosphere, people watch or track your pace and do it as a workout. There is something for everyone and I loved it."
303,5.0,"Seoul is an absolutely fabulous city full of fun, excitement, beauty, culture, but it is hectic. This stream in the middle of it all is an amazing escape and peaceful oasis where you can walk, sit and people watch and just recharge."
304,5.0,"This is one amazing work by the govt which converted and change this stream to clear water stream and odorless...with walkways and stage at certain part for performance. To see this in an ultra modern city which can provide calmness, relaxation for its citizen is really great... People were walking, jogging, cycling, pet walk without a worries as I saw there is security patrolling the area"
305,5.0,Lovely having this very pretty space right in the city - it's cool and quiet down there - very relaxing !
306,5.0,These days it is hard to imagine how this space was before the previous road was demolished. It was worthwhile overcoming the various objections raised to thwart this project that has now clearly much improved the urban environment
307,4.0,"Nice view for photo and nice place to visit. Good to learn about the historical and community environment. In the past, this area was a railway. But in the present, this is a nice park in the central of Seoul."
308,4.0,We stayed a bus ride away from the stream so we appreciated the nature amongst the bustling city when we arrived. The Stream is set lower than the streets surrounding it which separates the area a little better and as we walked down on a Saturday morning we were able to take a nice break before we headed out to busier parts of Seoul. It was a peaceful area and was nice to relax in.
309,5.0,This is special - very relaxing to walk along this little stream that flows through the heart of Seoul
310,4.0,"A nice way to spend some time, walking along the stream. Very quiet and relaxing - with the busy city above"
311,5.0,"We got lost while looking for this place but every step we took was worth it. The place was quiet and beautiful. It was serene and you can just sit there and relax. The place was a little smelly though, I think it was from the water. But the place was clean and I see a lot of people just taking the scenery in. If you are in Korea, you must visit this place."
312,5.0,Such a pleasant way to spend an evening strolling along the river. There are murals and buskers along the way as well as a digital light show. Highly recommended for your visit to Seoul.
313,5.0,"When to the section near Centermark Hotel. Although the weather was very chilly, and the path a bit slippery, it was greater and relaxing just hearing the flow of water. Different Scenery in different sections of the stream."
314,5.0,We walked from Gyeongbukgung palace and found ourselves resting by the stream. It was a soothing experience. We admired the fountain and had a look around the stalls set up near the shell statue called The Spring.
315,5.0,We decided to walk from Gwangjang Market to Dongdaemun Market (about 20 minutes) and it was such a peaceful walk. It felt like we stepped out of the city into another place.
316,2.0,Located in the center but not really clean stream. There is a bad smell from the water of this stream. Not worthy to visit
317,5.0,We talked the stream just after lunchtime on a sunny day in April. It was lovely. Exciting and relaxing at the same time. Everyone - from families having a picnic to the ubiquitious office workers on their cell phones - was out enjoying this lovely location. I see from the reviews that people who walked with stream in the winter were disappointed. So the season may make a big difference in visiting this lovely site.
318,5.0,Each season is different decorations. Very relaxing here a good place for couples to walk together get some breeze alongside the canal.
319,4.0,"For art lovers , then you could stay here. We had our own photo taking . Nice place to stroll around. Watch out for announcement of festivals , it would a much better environment."
320,4.0,"I’d suggest going early in the morning, and walking along this stream. No traffic lights here! Also in the evening, along some sections, there a small laser show. Actually quiet peaceful by this stream. Only negative, needs more signage, so you know where to exit from, or which street your at."
321,4.0,"As an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city I’d really recommend taking a walk along this river. There’s plenty of notices to read regarding how the area was recovered and regenerated and the different styles along the walk are impressive. It’s nice that over the weekend it wasn’t too busy, and it’s kept really clean in keeping with the rest of the city. If only to admire the work behind the regeneration, but also to see another side of the city, I’d walk down here again."
322,5.0,The stream right in the city was a welcome spot to relax and enjoy the environment. Across the street from my hotel was very easy to find.
323,5.0,We were probably there at the wrong time. But we still enjoyed the walk and the environment. We actually walked almost the entire length of the stream. It was very cold (end of March) and the water was icy but the pathway and rock paths were lovely.
324,2.0,We visited this in the day and it was just ok. At night time with the lights it would be a lot prettier a so I suggest you go then.
325,5.0,"The stream was clear and clean. There’s nothing much to do there apart from taking photos of the scenery and yourself, as well as taking a walk by the pavement beside it. Although there’s not much to do, it’s still a must visit in Seoul."

330,3.0,Nice place to walk through but nothing more than that its a romantic place for couples ( not my type )
331,3.0,"Walked along this stream during our recent visit to Seoul. It was winter, so not much going on. It was just an interesting break to a busy city. We understand in spring/summer, there are lights and various activities along the stream, so definitely worth a look then."
332,3.0,"It's beneath the streets, beautiful and relaxing. If you want to avoid the busy roads and traffic, take this peaceful side walk."

337,4.0,"I like to take a stroll here and watch the fish. There are some fishes in the water that you can just watch to kill time if you want. Also, you can book a free tour here too, very awesome. My tour guide told us that there are some koi fish in the water, and they go back to Han's river to lay eggs, and then they come back to the stream to visit. It was interesting how fish knows how to do that!! Well, this is a lovely place to come and see, read a book, take pictures, and have a bite."

Clean and uncluttered, the tagline then was ""I Seoul U""....."
340,4.0,Interesting visit in the middle of the city with loads of skyscrapers around. Must be a lovely place to visit in summer
341,4.0,"If you can spare a couple of hours, this stream is very accessible. However, experiences may vary as this stream is very long and not all portions are picturesque and scenic. It is unique as the stream traverses the city - some parts are so scenic that the hustle and bustle of the busy city can be overlooked. Best to look up the recommended train stations to alight at - there are several - and the walk from the train stations will be less that 10 to 15 minutes. Also, to enhance your experience, please take your strolls during the early morning or late afternoon/evening. Walking at noon NOT recommended especially in the blistering summer sun. We saw children/families having fun and even people trying to catch little fish, just enjoying little pockets of nature"
342,3.0,Neglected for many years this stream was restored and opened to public during 2005.This stream passes thru many Seoul’s many important landmarks. More than twenty bridges cross this stream which is about 8 km long flowing through the Seou’s downtown connecting northern and southern areas before joining the Han River.
343,2.0,"On Seoul official Instagram, I saw a gorgeous photo of the Cheonggyecheon Stream with beautiful lights decoration at night. So I decided to visit the stream. However, I couldn't find the beautiful lights decoration even though I walked for quite a distance. I searched for the lights at many parts of the stream - from Jongno to Dongdaemun. Couldn't find the lights so I gave up. Disappointed."
344,5.0,"Went to the stream in the evening so as to see the beautiful Christmas and New Year's lights. Was not disappointed! The lights were beautiful! However, it can get a little crowded so taking pictures was a little difficult."
345,1.0,"it was advertised that the schedule for autumn lantern display was until november 18, my mom and i went there on our last night on november 10 bearing with the chilly night weather, not a single lantern in sight, we also bumped into a few foreigners who are wondering saying aloud ""where are the lanterns?"""
346,5.0,"This is a great oasis in a very busy city, and is perfect for a contemplative walk, a jog, or just to sit and soak up the atmosphere."
347,4.0,"There's a nicely paved sidewalk on both sides of the stream here. The stream is pretty cute and clean. You can cross over to the other bank by walking across stones that have been placed in the stream. There are some nice plants, small waterfalls, etc."
348,1.0,"South Koreans don't like to pick up their litter. In an advanced country like this, everyone just throws their garbage everywhere. It's sad."
349,4.0,We visit this time in vor chritsmas time was very beautiful with many christmas deco a light a very crowded on weekend
350,5.0,Walking along the drain is usually nonsense....but here in Korea...you will fall in love with the drain that the Korean have done up perfectly for the tourist to see...The lights and design on the wall makes it so beautiful...There is no bad smell as you walk along the stream...worth the visit...
351,4.0,"This place is transformed to be a very beautiful area during christmas season.. all the lighting and christmas tree make it amazing at night. If u go to seoul on December, its a must see.."
352,5.0,Visited the real thing you see in KDramas. Exactly what I expected. Nice and pleasant walk along the stream. Easily accessible. Close to hotels and subway plus within walking distance of Myeong-dong and Insadong.
353,4.0,"I'd read a lot about the river in Seoul that had been rejuvenated. On a long business visit to Seoul, I decided to see it for myself.  I took a couple of trains that brought me to the stream. The stream is quite long and has a fair number of visitors but it never feels crowded and you can always find a spot to dip your feet and watch the world go by.  The water is crystal clear and there are areas with fountains that make for a nice view. Towards evening, LED lights come up and make it an enchanting place.  I would highly recommend visiting this venue. It's a lovely way to spend an evening in Seoul and an oasis of calm in a hustling metropolis. I wish more cities took the effort to create public places of this nature."
354,3.0,"The stream is decorated and lite for Christmas lantern around the week of Christmas. The stream was strung with overhead lanterns and yule-time lighted figures was setup throughout a length of stream. There was also some folk dancing and a setup where people could light lanterns and float them down the stream. Of course, there was the usual food booths. Fairly busy with lots of local people attending."
355,5.0,"Despite the freezing cold, the beautiful and colorful display of Christmas lights made our day. 2 thumbs up!"
356,5.0,What an enjoyable stroll we had with lights and decorations! Our walk was delightful and we were able to stop and take pictures along the stream.
357,5.0,We were so lucky to see the Lantern Festival! This is a man made walkway with a stream of water that is under the traffic and is 5 miles long. It is a well planned space for a busy city.
358,4.0,"Yes, I've been here before in 2009. Still, I'm amazed at how the people have kept this stream clean. Hats off to you! See attached pictures and notice the clear water and wildlife. There are CCTV cameras along the stream, too."
359,5.0,"I really love how the city have transformed a once eye-sore into a beautiful and clean place for both locals and foreigners. Our visit on this place was made even special because of the Lantern Festival. Though we are a day late for the festival we are still greeted with meaningful and wonderful works of art. The displays showcased the things that make Korea - Korea, from the old day to the modern day. I love how peaceful the place is despite the busyness that's surrounding it. The place is landscaped beautifully. It's also a walking distance to Gyeongbukgong, Gwanghwamun Square, to King Sejong and Admiral Shin's monument."
360,5.0,"It's hard to believe your in the city. I really recommend not just walking along the stream but getting a nice pastry a great cup of coffee and enjoying a moment or 3.  Check out the safety features as well, to be honest I have never seen such good emergency preparedness."
361,5.0,This place was renovated during president Lee and it’s beautifully done. I enjoyed walking down the stream.
362,3.0,"There is no way to miss it, although I would not go out of my way to see it. A path walkway along both sides of a small stream of water in the middle of a noisy city is where you can spend a few peaceful minutes. Some areas are wider and have granite like floor whereas; as you walk away form downtown you get a more bucolic feel."
363,5.0,"We walked for about 1 mile along this stream, which features a narrow park-like setting on both sides, and found this space to provide a lovely respite from the city’s noise and high-rises. Part of a program to provide green areas in Seoul, the area opened in 2005 after the removal of an elevated highway and roads that hid what was left of a stream below. To keep it running now, water is pumped from elsewhere to maintain a steady flow.  Cheonggye Plaza near Gwanghwamun Square in north-central Seoul marks the starting point, A tall modern sculpture by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggeu signals the plaza. Titled “Spring,” the work displays alternate red and blue spirals and resembles a thin Christmas tree.  We descended steps that lead to a walkway, where the immediate view is a wide waterfall to the right, which plunges into the stream. No vegetation appears in this section, but greenery, including trees, soon comes into view. Footbridges and stepping stones sometimes gave access to the opposite side of the stream. Flowers arranged in boxes and pots on walls brightened the area. Nature kept our attention, and we hardly noticed the tall buildings in adjoining neighborhoods. Only a few people wandered here on this Saturday morning, and we much appreciated the serenity."
364,4.0,"this was an unusual find, a gentle stream running through modern skyscrapers on both banks. Good for a quick escape."
365,5.0,We went to the Lantern festival and stayed along the stream. It is a very nice beautiful location. There were places to eat and shop as well.
366,5.0,This is a great little walk and at the moment it’s hosting the lantern festival and a good place to grab a drink or some food and sit in The Sun
367,5.0,"Cheonggyecheon Stream is a quiet peaceful path along a small river in the center of Seoul. As you are below street level car noise is much less. Crowded during the Seoul Lantern festival, but beautiful to see all the unique designs. I great way to walk away from traffic"
368,4.0,"What a peaceful, yet lively place! If you're ever in Seoul, take a stroll along the stream and enjoy your time. If I loved closeby, I think I would want to walk there every morning.  What I really liked was the mix of nature and art at the stream. As you walk down the path, you’ll come across murals, paintings, and even plaques that write about the history of the stream."
369,5.0,"We came here late in the afternoon. We were able to walk along the stream and see how clean the water was before the sun went down. In the evening, the lanterns were lit and it was beautiful!  It is easily accessible from the street and there were elevators in some parts."
370,4.0,Lost stream / river that sadly extinct but got revived by the technology. Beautiful at night with the light display
371,5.0,"From my hotel, it was a short walk to the Cheonggyecheon Stream. I went late in the afternoon and before I left, the lights were on in the lantern decorations in the stream. It is a peaceful place. The sound of the running water is soothing. The Festival of Lights was beautiful."
372,3.0,Displays of lanterns along the stream. Nice place to chill out and enjoy the lovely lights after a day of shopping!
373,5.0,"If you want to escape the hustle of Seoul without even leaving it, his stream is the right place. You can walk for a long time in peace, watching fish swim along the stream. It is absolutely gorgeous on a sunny day and easily accessed via metro"
374,3.0,Good chilly walk during the autumn. Happy to see the stream is well maintained and the water is clean in such hectic city.
375,4.0,Nice place to stroll and take pictures. Pretty at night as the lights gives the area a nice atmosphere.
376,4.0,"This is a good example of a worthy attempt to turn what was a stream that was extremely polluted and choked with sewerage and rubbish; cleaned out, exposed to air and light, restored and redesigned to turn it into city asset. It still smells a bit but it's worth seeing."
377,4.0,"The views are nice with large fish in the river, the scene is very peaceful, with the city sounds easily muffled by the rushing water Rather than visit the stream for itself, the best way is to visit the many indoor and outside shopping malls along its 6 mile course and then walk a little of the stream's path to get from one market to another."
378,3.0,Unless u are a couple which is food as it's dark. If not go in the morning between 9 to 12 PM as you will be able to see the change of guards. As night time unless there are some events if not . There are not much lights to see much of the beautiful history or this stream which survived wars
379,2.0,Perhaps it would be better to come here at night with the lights on. I came here in the afternoon & there was so many small flies flying around!
380,4.0,Lovely way to get away from the streets and still get where you need to go. The sound of the water and traditional music was a nice change from the cars when walking the busy streets. There was still a lot of greenery in October.
381,4.0,"Yes, try to stroll a stretch along this stream. Really gives you a break from the city traffic and noises..."
382,4.0,We visited at night as everything started to light up. if you're after a pleasant and peaceful stroll along the river it's nice.
383,5.0,"I love this stream. It’s very clean. Very serene, especially if you get to go there when it’s not busy with a lot of other tourists. Great place to relax and enjoy nature after walking to see palaces/museums/sights the whole day. Such a peaceful place to be especially in busy Seoul City."
384,4.0,We arrived ard 8pm . Not really pack in a cold nite. A few couples dating n few foreigners... A good cold walk with kids... And beautiful light out there.. Stream connecting City Hall to Myeongdong with a 10-15mins walk. Enjoy
385,4.0,"Having arrived from Europe after two long flights the day before I was in dire need of stretching my legs. I was pleasantly surprised that the Cheonggyecheon Stream starts quite close to the City Hall and my hotel. I threw my little rucksack onto my back and proceeded to walk downstream.  I didn’t track how far I walked. It was just nice to relax in the sun, taking it nice and easy and stopping from time to time to take the odd photograph and ogle at the large carp swimming in the water. I liked the stepping stones placed strategically across the stream at numerous places. And underneath the bridges you could sit in the shade, read posters and signs and even enjoy a small art exhibition under one of them.  At one point, way down stream, I climbed the stairs up to normal street level and discovered a large textile market. On the way back I walked at street level just to get the feel of the normal weekday hubbub.  It was certainly an unusual experience to see such a peaceful stream running through the Centre of such a busy city with the normal traffic and hectic life continuing unabated at street level.  Certainly a nice way to spend some down time. And I clocked up many more than my usual daily 10.000 steps making up for sitting around in planes the day before."
386,4.0,"This is the 2nd time we've walked down the stream from City Hall. No regrets. Do spend about 30mins, especially if one is heading to Insadong and some areas along the stream are nicely done up"
387,4.0,"I saw this recommended in a travel guide and as it was not far from our hotel we spent an hour or so wandering along a section of the stream. What a pleasant surprise to discover this in the middle of the commercial district, a real oasis of peace and calm surrounded by trees and occasional artwork. Sadly we didn’t have the chance to return in the evening but it must be lovely when all the lanterns are lit up."
388,5.0,"Not much to do around here, just walking and taking pictures.. but it indeed is a beautiful place, even more beautiful at night!"
389,4.0,Very relaxing walk.....It is possible to walk up to the Han river and there are some paintings along the walk You can always interrupt it as there are stairs or elevators in certain areas..
390,4.0,"nice place to walk in the evening, when the lantarns are in the water arround the festival periods it is just perfect"
391,4.0,"During the day, the stream is just there amongst the hustle as it is close to the markets.  At night, it comes alive with lights that give it a unique feel. There is a water fall with lights at one end and then you follow it down where there is displays of light here and there.  There are stone steps across the steam if you want to cross over. I enjoyed walking below the street level with the stream next to me while you are surrounded by office towers."
392,5.0,"A great place to visit if you want to escape the hustle and bustle of Seoul for a bit. I was able to relax and revive here. The path is well constructed and very pleasant to wander as much as you desire. The sound of the stream trickling past is relaxing. Some flowers adorn some of the side parts of the stream. Lit up at night, the stream has a different ambience again. Stepping stones along some parts of the stream create lots of fun for kids and adults alike to jump from one stone to another. The depth of the stream is not too deep, but keep a watch and hold your kid's hands to prevent an unwanted fall in the water. No cafes so bring your own water to drink. Many steps at various points to access the river, and occasional ramps provide good access. I loved it here!"
393,5.0,"Wow. What a great place to go for a stroll in this noisy, big city. I lived in Korea many years ago and it’s hard to believe this river was under my feet.  It’s a lovely place to walk and take a break."
394,5.0,Cheonggyecheon Stream is a great spot to relax at as there are large stones under the bridge to sit on to get out of the sun or rain. There is a section lined with decorated tiles with drawings and writing on them which is a nice touch and it seems like the community got involved when cleaning up this beautiful walking route.
395,3.0,I decided to visit Cheonggyecheon Stream during a run in Seoul. It was perfect for just this - was not too busy and the terrain was faily OK and flat. When I visited they were just setting up the lanterns for the festival so they had not yet been switched on. I imagine the stream would be quite impressive when lit.
396,5.0,Really just an outdoor park space to hang with. Maybe eat or drink while you are there. Interesting from a revitalization perspective but it really is just a quick walk.
397,4.0,"I planned to find this stream but I couldn’t work out the route on foot from where I was staying, then I went out for a wander and ended up here anyway! It was night so I didn’t get good pictures but I could see it and there were some lights too, it was a nice little bit of nature in the middle of a load of skyscraper buildings, worth a look if you’re in the area, and some cool stuff nearby too."
398,5.0,This is such a lovely place to visit in the hub of a busy city. We strolled along the stream in the evening and it was just lovely and peaceful.
399,5.0,"Perfect for a walk around, having a snack there, chilling. It is amazing how there is a river just in between the city."
400,5.0,I visit Seoul often on business and I always walk the length of Cheongyecheon Stream. It's a lovely walk and takes you right through the heart of the city. I usually take a metro to the end and then walk all the way to City Hall.
401,5.0,My son and I did enjoy our walk. It was great to be able to relax in this little sanctuary far away from the noise and the traffic. It's worth the walk.
402,5.0,I usually go to S.Korea in the winter time so there are always light installations at the stream. It's very nicely designed and perfect for photo ops! If you're in S.Korea I totally recommend this as a place to check out.
403,4.0,"Walked this a couple of times, and the bubbling waters provide a nice break from the surrounding city. Believe this used to be an actual road which has been converted. Plenty of fish in the water........but not one single duck to be seen."
404,5.0,"Buy some street food and bring it here with a loved one or someone you're trying to woo. It will make them fall for you just like in K-dramas. Even better, if it's raining, make them share an umbrella with you."
405,5.0,"We were fortunate enough during pur visit because there was a Lantern Festival so this place looked so nice with all the lights and parades. A must watch festival, I should say also."
406,5.0,"I am shocked by the fact this stream is so clear that you can see fishes. The water is so cold. Try putting your legs there. It's refreshing! And, don't forget to cross the river. After a long day, spending my time at this stream heals me a lot."
407,5.0,"Our hotel was right next to the steam (New Kukje, stay there!), so we spent some time walking up and down to various places. Lovely place where many locals go to escape and relax. Beautiful at night."
408,5.0,Lovely for a walk day or night the area is very well lit. They also hold a lantern festival here around november time so definitely check it out well worth it and best part it's FREEEEEEE
409,5.0,"This is a lovely place to take a quiet stroll, and makes for a nice alternative to the sidewalks above. It's well lit at night as well."
410,3.0,"It is a stream in the city where some locals sit by, have a picnic and chat with friends. I didn’t find anything particularly special about it."
411,4.0,"Lovely little stream, the history behind it as well is also fascinating. Nice and cool with lots of shade on hot days, and not too busy either."
412,5.0,Just amazing walking during nighttime when light ambiance are perfect. Calming to stroll alongside the stream and look at some of the light show displayed on the wall side.
413,4.0,"a nice respite away from the hustle and bustle. very peaceful. and since its underground, you dont need to worry about traffic."
414,3.0,"The stream is a very pleasant alternative to walking along the normal path.  The stream had been covered over but was discovered and brought back to its present condition- search the history.  I walked along it a couple of times, the second had a heron in the middle. The plants are kept and replanted so it is very pretty too.  Can be a bit noisy if events going on above, but generally a lovely bit of calm in the middle of the city."
415,4.0,This was a great location to get a small respite from the bustling city life. It was clean and beautiful. If you are looking for more than a walk along a stream you will be disappointed though. There were nice cool places to sit and take a break and I even put my feet in the water (although I am not sure this is permitted).
416,4.0,When I was there this was a small oasis....nice cool running water to dip your toes in and chat with other overheated tourists :-)
417,4.0,"Great way to stroll the city without traffic. Lighting at night makes you forget you are in a busy city. We used the canal to get from one area to another. Lots of people during the day enjoying lunch, too. We even saw a heron chasing a fish!"
418,5.0,"We started at the Cheonggye Plaza end to admire the fountains. When at the plaza facing the stream, there is a ramp to your right that leads down to stream-level. It was nice and cool in the evening, and there were a lot of people just relaxing on the steps, some with their feet in the stream. There were musicians playing, and it seemed that every tunnel or wall had its own theme. Would love to go the entire length of this stream someday."
419,5.0,I enjoy this peaceful river on my walk from Koreana Hotel to the office. In the morning it is quiet and peaceful. Sometimes in the day there are peaceful events for gathering. Traffic is not so busy as the main streets. I start at the spiral as the river begins and grows.
420,4.0,Grab a coffee from The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf then take youself for a relaxing stroll - nice escape from the hustle and bustle above
421,5.0,This was a nice stroll and a break from the square. There is a before and after photo of this area. I found the historical image from Seoul Sky
422,5.0,"The famous Cheonggyecheon stream which pass through the Seoul city centre is beautifully cool, clear and clean. It really helps in the hot summer season. We can sit on the rock and relaxing our feet in the stream while watching some fishes swim around out feet."
423,3.0,"I had high expectation of this place, after reading all the reviews. I do find it strange that no one seem to mention the foul smell along the river bank.  I went there a few days ago, at last morning. Few people were walking along the riverbank and even though I totally agree that the area is so nicely done up, I didn't enjoy the stroll as there was a light stench, which I assume, was coming from the stream.  I started the walk from Jongno 2-ga station. It was just about 5 min. from the stream. I left after a brief 10 min. walk."
424,4.0,"Offers light show, a good walk or place to dip your feet during summer. This park caters to all. A good walking distance from Myeongdong Shopping Street."
425,5.0,It is near the city hall station and is very nice place to visit. There is not only the stream but also a nice fall.
426,4.0,"This is about the most peaceful place in Seoul that I could possibly think of. Spring and fall are great times to visit, and the stream also plays host to the Lantern Festival in November. Usually a lot of space to relax, unwind, and contemplate."
427,5.0,"Amazed by the size and amount of fish in this stream, great place to cool your feet off in the heat, and Bang right in the middle of the city!"
428,5.0,"Good for jogging, walking or just yo sit and enjoy the sound of water. Try dipping your feet in the water and relax."
429,3.0,good place to chill out. Can put your legs in the water. sourrounded by good eateries. across the road you can see few iconic places.
430,4.0,We st err polled along the water on our way to eat out. The sides are nicely maintained for enjoying the water and wildlife. Very relaxing and unexpected for a city of this size.
431,5.0,"Such a lovely and peaceful spot to rest during your busy sight seeing day. After spending quite a bit of time shopping and eating in Insadong and visiting the temple across the street, I continued walking to the subway and came upon this stream. I decided to hang out here a bit. There were lots of people sitting by the stream. People were reading or eating, taking photos. There were couples on dates here, kids playing around. There were some protestors walking around - one group anti abortion and another for it. There was a band performing. Basically there is a lot going on! But it's still possible to find a quiet section along the stream as it's long. Would definitely recommend this place."
432,4.0,"A lovely way to get through the city, walking by the stream. There are little rocks that you can use to cross the stream and you can take shelter from the sun under the bridges, just like the locals. At the end is a waterfall with a wishing well. Along the wall is a mural depicting South Korea's history."
433,5.0,this stream is very coozy for couple to take date.when spring they have this kind of festival that you can enjoy for free.
434,4.0,I love this place but too bad I always went there in the afternoon. Hope i could visit there at night later
435,5.0,"Good way to relax in evening, very close to Gwanghwamun square. in evening with color full lighting it enhanced its beauty."
436,4.0,"The stream has delightful walking paths alongside. Whilst we walked we noticed little rapids, places to cross the stream as well as many fish. A nice place to forget you are in the middle of a big city."
437,4.0,"We were staying at a nearby hotel and just outside was Cheonggyecheon Stream beside the Dongdaemun Shopping Center. My wife had reminded me that this is a favourite place for so many Korean soap opera shoots. The stream is really long, but we only descended to the strwam beside the Ogansugyo Bridge and then walked along side the stream just past the Beodeuldari Bridge. The great thing about this place is that there are many people walking and talking photos or just sitting and talking and relaxing.  One side of the stream had lush vegetation while the other side was more of a wall and wide lane. There are large stepping stones every so often so that you can cross the stream safely, we saw an elderly couple manage it without problem, and the stream is actually full of fish, some quite large, which was really great for the kids to see.  There are both steps and ramps (for wheelchairs) up to the street level so that anyone can walk beside the stream."
438,5.0,"Some years ago the city decided to tear up a road as there was a stream underneath it, and now it has been developed into a beautiful place to walk. There are fish in the stream, plants by the banks and a few sculptures. Walking along the paths, either side of the stream, a few meters below the surrounding area it is quite peaceful and many of the noises of the city cannot be heard. What a wonderful development."
439,5.0,"It is well worth seeking out a walk along the Cheonggyecheon Stream, we were fortunate to be staying one block away from the stream and had time for two walks, one in the morning and the other in the afternoon, both times it was wonderful to escape the busy Seoul streets.  The stream is well used by locals getting out and about for a little fresh air and exercise, it was relatively peaceful even though up above are roads. Along the wall of the pathway are signs letting you know were you are in relation to the streets above, distances and some interesting art installations. We also loved to see large fish in the stream, hopefully a good sign of water quality, as it looked clear."
440,5.0,"The stream is located in the center of Seoul City, near the Line 1 Subway Station from Dongdaemun Station to City Hall. It is really a nice place for walking or jogging through the autumn or spring. It is really freezing on winter so it is not recommended to go here but you can come here on summer to enjoy the fresh air. I’m not recommending you to go on jogging summer because Korean’s summer is really humid."
441,5.0,"This stream is honestly so peaceful and relaxing, that i would go back every time I had the opportunity to. The water is full of fishes, the side with chirping birds (and pigeons). We even saw an egret hunting for fish."
442,5.0,This stream was once buried under and restored with help some of SK's big company. A nice place to a leisure stroll around and free of charge...yay. The KTO ofiice located near the Cheonggyecheon Stream.
443,3.0,"Cheonggyecheon stream is almost 11km long. Was there in winter and it was freezing cold during the day. In the evening, it was worse. So go prepared with warm clothing with gloves and all as it is a lot of walking, unless u decided to abandon the walk midway. The stream is well decorated during festive seasons and attract lots of tourist and locals alike. You can get to Cheonggyecheon stream by Seoul Subway; Take Subway Line 5 to Gwanghwamun Station and Exit 5. Alternatively, take Seoul Subway Line 1 or 2 to City Hall Station and Exit 4."
444,3.0,"The stream itself is nothing special to be honest, but it's a nice place to relax. There are lots of people around towards sunset and it had a great vibe. Bring some food and drinks - think that would be ideal."
445,5.0,"Having a walk beside the stream in a hot summer afternoon, you feel cool, quite and relax. It is really a marvelous water work, turning a dirty sewage into a clear stream."
446,5.0,"Its refreshing, in the middle of the road you cant believe that you can find a clean water and solemn park."
447,5.0,"This place comes alive at night. Night bazaars lighting up the place, and busking groups spread across the area. The area used to be a place of waste, but then it was rebuilt as public place with a stream flowing in the middle. Stairs are provided for people to sit down and spend times with loved ones. You can even dip your feet in the stream as it is very shallow. You can find friends, lovers, and sometimes family just sit beside the stream, chatting, eat, and drink beers. The place is near Gwanghwamun area, so you can also enjoy buildings and night lights."
448,2.0,"Just landscaped, remodeled stream. It was a canal.  Only visit if you happen to be in the area. There is an interesting secondhand market nearby."
449,4.0,Cheonggyecheon Stream is in the middle of big city - Seoul. In summer it look like a small forest. It’s really good to walk there in the morning or evening. But you should be careful because there are lots of tine tiny mosquitoes. And you should be ready to make photo because you can see Asian bird. It’s nice place for walking.
450,5.0,I'm a nature lover that's why i love this stream. Its sound and the cold water is sooo refreshing. A must go place after a tiring all day seoul touring. :)
451,5.0,"The sight of Cheonggycheon Strem changes very frequently throughout the year, as all kinds of events are organized along it. My favourites were the lantern launching (sometime in November) and the Christmas decorations exhibited along the stream during winter time. It is worth walking along it and realizing how much this place has changed since the time it was just .....a stinky flow of water."
452,5.0,"I came here in the middle of summer and I must say I had a good time by just sitting on the bank, watching the water flow. It was therapeutic in a way. I even played on big stones on the stream to get across the other side. It's also fun to see locals who would dip their feet on the stream to refresh them. Plus points for the location, upon exit from the subway station, I easily spotted the ""unicorn"" or the entrance of the stream. The subway exit is barely a minute away from the entrance of the stream.  Will I come back? Definitely. And I will recommend this to anyone going to Seoul."
453,4.0,"The stream is a quiet respite from the busy streets above, popular with local couples and those desiring a peaceful moment. The stream is accented with lights and stepping stones, and we found it to be clean and pleasant."
454,4.0,the stream is a great place to rest after a whole day of walking went there around 5 pm rested before heading to dinner... you can see a lot of locals there as well and the place is clean. the stream is long so if you plan to visit better check with tourist information... we almost went to seoul station just to see the stream while we were in insadong but it crosses insadong as well so after asking tourist info we were directed to the stream
455,5.0,"Enjoyed walking along the bank of the stream. Delightfully ‘landscaped ‘ to create a charming place to walk away from the road. Pretty development, can even sit and dangle feet in the water. Enjoyed watching local people taking a stroll at the weekend."
456,4.0,This stream area is nice to walk and lively. At times they had tents set up with items for sale. Definitely worth checking out.
457,5.0,"Very cool manmade underground stream. Often there are concerts , markets or other events held at the beginning of the stream"
458,5.0,"Seoul has more than its fair share of linear parks, but this one takes the cake in terms of being useful and beautiful. There's stepping stones across the stream, there's sitting areas, there's painted ceramic tiles, waterfalls, trees and shade. There's directional signage to the nearest metro stop at each exit stair from the Stream. Not many garbage cans, not for bikes, more for walkers, no vending machines if you are thirsty. Occasionally, there were swarms of gnats. Water is so clean you can see variety of fishy inhabitants."
459,4.0,"Good time to visit are at spring, summer, and early fall, since the weather may get colder as time goes. best time to visit is at afternoon to evening, especially when there is lantern festival. there will be a lantern statue along the river."
460,4.0,"Its a narrow sream yet relaxing and very silent. When i first put my feet in the stream ,i never thought many big fish live here,take some bread with you and try feeding fish and after a moment you will be surprised!"
461,5.0,Beautiful man made stream and love the rainbow lights. Landscaping along the stream are beautifully done. Must see
462,5.0,"Its so refreshing and calming, listening to the flowing water.  Nice place to take a rest when you get tired walking."
463,5.0,"Have a stroll down the stream with your loved ones, family, alone or a best friend.  Super relaxing and the whole vibe is sure to get you in the mood to want to lay your mat and picnic somewhere cosy.  If you’re lucky you might spot cute ducks waddling in the stream.  Recommended, highly. If you love quiet places to spend quality time with your loved ones or alone."
464,5.0,"Ever since I watched the Korean drama, this place has always been flagged out as one of the filming site. I am intrigued to see a place right in the city, with stream and rock, you just feel that that is the perfect getaway after a long day of hard work. See it in the daytime and night time, the feel is different."
465,5.0,The first time I have been here with my boyfriend. The place so beautiful and romantic. In here many many couples. I was happy there with my boyfriend. We were also eat something around ( street food) very delicious ☺️️
466,5.0,Understand that this is the original river which flows through the city. It was slabbed over by the previous city inhabitants and was uncovered in modern times.  This is an open river which is set below the road level and can be accessed at various staircases along its length. The water is clean and locals seem to like to sit along the river and enjoy its beauty. There are also some buskers when we were there.  Worth visiting.
467,4.0,"We weren't sure which area exactly to walk by the stream. We were at DDP and decided to check out the Cheonggyecheon Stream. We walked down and crossed over the stone tiles. My kids were particularly happy and crossed over it many times. I was expecting more people to be hanging out by the stream, so I wasn't sure whether we were at the right spot or if there are better areas of the stream to explore. Overall, it was a nice leisurely relaxing walk by the stream and we enjoyed."
468,4.0,"Walked along a short stretch of the stream one evening. Interesting and lovely place, mostly for couples to stroll and spend time together below the city streets. The entire stream is quite long so we just had a short visit on the side nearer to Myeongdong."
469,3.0,The stream is a little green oases in the city which makes it pleasant to stroll along at night but unfortunately it also smells like sewer at certain places.
470,4.0,"I went there at night and it´s very interesting. It has different figures during the stream, some historic, some modern, artistic and so on. It is very long, so you can decide where you end it."
471,4.0,It was a good walk along the water from JW till the Gwanghwamun Square to go to the palace. Instead of walking on the streets with the pollution and the walking light stops - prefer walking along the water. The end of the stream near the Gwanghwamun square is the highlight of this place!
472,3.0,"I was here walking along the river years ago. At that time, it was very beautiful. At this time around, in year 2018, it was not well maintained. It does need refurbishment as there is still a potential."
473,4.0,A nice walkway cutting east to west through the city. Peaceful. A nice walk away from the traffic. A lot of people just strolling and sitting
474,5.0,"Even if it is surrounded by markets, buildings and roads, it is actually a nice place to take a break from the bustling of the city."
475,4.0,"I went there on an afternoon before the spring lantern festival started. It is very peaceful, you can take off your shoes and go down to the water, or just stroll, sit down, and relax. And take good photos. There were a bazaar happened as well, but the bazaar started at 6, and I think it was only temporary. Depending on when you visit, check out if festival or bazaar are happening, it'll be worth to visit."
476,2.0,If you at dongdaemun area just stroll the alley. Jangan kan tidak je. Dongdaemun gate - cheongyecheon stream - DDP + Dongdaemun History & Culture Park(LED white rose) All walking distance in same area.
477,5.0,"Clearly a popular hangout. It is a beautiful spot, especially right now with the lanterns. Looks amazing all lite up at night."
478,4.0,"Every now and then some events are organised here. We went here many times: new year celebration, lantern festival etc."
479,4.0,It’s great that Seoul was able to clean up this stream. Some fish up to about 2’ swimming as well as some other little ones. Pretty green area below street level thru the city with stepping stones at intervals to cross from one side to the other. We walked from near Jongmyo to the JW Marriott.
480,5.0,"it is a very serene and beautiful place at night. it is a place of rich history and also a popilar dating spot for couples. It is also very near Insadong so do check it out if you want a to go to a place that is less crowded, yet insta-worthy."
481,5.0,"Go for a night time walk, do a few kilometres and look at the light show, fountains, art displays and people. Lovely place for a stroll, safe like all of Korea, great innovative art installations which change constantly."
482,3.0,"The stream is supposed to be very lovely with loads of greenery and flowers in spring. But the weather was rather freaky when I was there in early April and even the locals I chatted with said it was too cold at -1 and 0 on some days. The stream was a good way to get back to Myeongdong with the help of google maps. However l, there wasn’t much to See when I was there."
483,4.0,"One way to get here is Subway line 5 - Exit 5 Gwanghwamun Station. Alternatively, if you have time, get off at City Hall Line 1 exit 1 and if you head down towards Sejong-daero you'll pass Deoksugung Doldam-gil (arguably, voted the best street in Seoul), and Deoksugung Palace. On the right, before you get to Gwanghwamun Square, is Cheonggye Plaza and the famous stream, landmarked by what looks like a purple, spiral Xmas tree. I went at dusk, and it was very pretty with the lights. Buskers (very good) were singing, and food stalls, which smelled delicious, were opening. There was also trinket stalls (different from the usual tourist stuff) - it was bustling with locals (couples on a romantic walk) so the atmosphere was lovely. A very nice way to spend an early evening. If you continue on to Gwanghwamun Square you'll see Gyeongbokgung Palaces main gates."
484,4.0,"It's close to Fraser place central Seoul about 15 to 20 minutes walk basically it's a stream and on the sides you can walk or sit to chat or eat, I read that at night there are activities, but unfortunately I didn't have the time to check it at night"
485,3.0,"Nice area to walk through. We went at sunset in the beginning of spring and it was pretty chilly when we went so we didn't stay for long. There are murals on the walls with plaques about the history of the area. There are also stepping stones across the stream, which is quite nice."
486,4.0,"Little fountains. waterfalls, lots of places to sit but it's all concrete. If you are walking by the area, you would enjoy it for 10 minutes"
487,5.0,"As can be seen in some K-dramas, this stream is famous for couples to sit around with some food and drinks in hand.  If you are lucky, there will be lots of street food van selling along the road sides. I’m not sure the frequency of the food stalls open and I guess it might be on Fridays and Saturdays night only."
488,5.0,"Had to visit this stream in our tour, but before that you will pass Kyobo, which I think the biggest bookstore I've seen in my entire existence yet. And after there you'd see this stream which is a very nice place, but yeah nothing much to do here."
489,3.0,"It was a very nice park, a good backdrop to the surrounding urban area, very clean and filled with people. It's a good place to take a walk or sit and people watch but not really much else. Restaurants and shops line the edges so that helps too if you want to take a nice walk after dinner, but that's about it. Stop by if you're close or have the time in your itinerary."
490,3.0,"When reaching Seoul, we've been told this place is a must seen. All i can say, its a nice place, but over hyped. Recommend going there but without a lot of expectations."
491,4.0,"This canal has undergone refurbishing and beautifying works from what it once was to a place where people gather for a stroll and to just unwind. It's very clean and there is no foul smell. During festival seasons, this place will be decorated accordingly and will be much more impressive than on normal days."
492,3.0,"Maybe there isn't any festival going on, thus nothing special or no special lighting or whatsoever when I visited. Just a another canal that allows people to walk beside it and enjoy the serenity within a busy centralized city."
493,4.0,"If you want to walk through the city, without having to cross roads and deal with traffic then this is a perfect place to walk along. The stream and plants make it very pretty. It’s quiet in the morning but it’s a popular place for city workers to spend lunchtime, so gets much busier later in the day."
494,3.0,"I was in Seoul in February (a side trip while visiting the Olympics). I walked by this stream a few times, but it did not appear to be anything special. Maybe it would be worth it if you needed to waste time and there was some sort of event happening (e.g. lantern festival), or maybe it would be nicer in warmer weather. But I would say it's not necessary for your trip to Seoul."
495,3.0,The place was a bit boring when I went there at around 10am... Just the stream... Altho there were only a few people if you want to take good photos of the stream. It would be good to come here if there is any festival or if there are lights at night.
496,5.0,A small canal about 10 km in the center of Seoul. The canal has been rotten in the past. Now it is the public park and it has waterfalls in the big city center between many tall buildings. It make us relax.
497,4.0,Beautifully done & environmentally friendly way of showcasing the stream that runs though Seoul CBD. Incorporated into everyday life an option for locals & tourists alike to take a break from the hustle & bustle to watch & listen to the sound of flowing water.
498,5.0,"When you have done a whole day of walking in the Dongdaemun area, this spot is idyllic for rest and people-watching.  As with most of Seoul, this park is well-kept. There is ample room for people to sit and enjoy the scenery. We went here in different parts of the day and observed that it never gets too crowded."
499,5.0,"despite going at night and not being able to see the fish, my 3YO still loved it - especially crossing the stream using the stepping stones. loved the stony paths, trees and pockets of flowers along the stream which made me feel like walking in the country side. wonderful place for picnics."
500,3.0,We have reached the place by chance And enjoyed it It is a river like place were u can enjoy the moment  The only disadvantage is that you can not get down with a stroller you have to carry it along with your toddler/ baby
501,5.0,"So relaxing walk along the stream. Enjoy the scene of Clear water, bird flying, fish swimming in the stream."
502,4.0,Beautiful small stream in Downtown. The stream will more beautiful then usual one special event such as Christmas.
503,4.0,We started our walk from gwanghwamun.... It was a very nice stroll and relaxing. In between the walk you can choose to exit to street level attractions or night market or bars..... Really a nice walk and place to be after a heavy Korean dinner
504,5.0,"After many activities of shopping and eating in Seoul, this river offers freshness and tranquility. You can just take a walk or run (if you want) along the river. It is FREE and refreshing! There is also a coin spot for you to make a wish in this river. Such a lovely place 💙"
505,5.0,"A nice way to move through the city, quiet and pretty. There are a few places you can scan with your phone and get translated information on the plaques/exhibits."
506,3.0,Imagined this place would be somewhat more special. Just a rather boring canal/stream. Decent if you want to go for a walk before heading to insadong
507,4.0,"If u plan to shop in dongdeamum , i suggest u leave a few time to stay here, this re-new stream is a nice place to stay as a little break during ur shopping day . U can sit beside the stream n drink some coffee eat some donut or korean snacksn enjoy the sunlight in spring. U will love it."
508,5.0,Great place to stroll and jog in the morning. You will see many older couples or groups walking along this stream. It becomes quite dark once the evening sets in. This reclaimed stream is long with many access points to the surface streets via stairs and cuts across a few neighborhoods. Certain areas of the streams sometimes have stages set up for concerts/performances. A lantern festival is held here every year towards mid-November.
509,4.0,"We decided to take a walk down to the Cheonggyecheon Stream whilst in Seoul, there was a festival of light on at the time with many different themes. Was very nice and also makes a nice walk especially after a dinner !! Its quite amazing not so long ago this was a very polluted stream, now all cleaned up and tourist attraction. Word of caution, if your there during winter and you walk the stream walk, make sure you have warm clothing on as it gets very cold next to the water."
510,4.0,"Walked along side this stream and enjoyed the walk. Also many restaurants and shops near by. towards the one end you will also find a food market, cloth market etc..."
511,5.0,"Even though there aren't many attractions nearby, only fast food restaurants and the street with the statues of the most important people in Korean history (king Yi Do and general Yi Sun Shin), I highly recommend you to go see it. I was there at noon and I wasn't disappointed even though it wasn't night time when the lights are turned on and it's probably even more breathtaking. I will surely come back here if I'll be back in Seoul. P.s: it's a common place for dates in SK so I think it says a lot about this place greatness and popularity ;)"
512,4.0,This is a very cool waterway that runs along the city with a pedestrian path and great photo opportunities. Was lucky enough to make it out on my last morning in Seoul to go for a run and came along this stream which was great and also had a few benches along the way.
513,5.0,The City of Seoul did a exceptional work to beautify this stream. It utilizes the stream as relax area for the busy city dweller. The decoration changes often. My visit was during X'mas time. There are plenty of special features along the stream. One should visit this place all the time........To relax and to see what new features they added.
514,4.0,It's a great place to go when it's not too hot outside. A mall & plenty of places to eat are nearby.
515,5.0,"We really enjoyed the lovely river walk. It was winter, so probably not as pretty as it must be in the summer, but the sound of running water was very relaxing. Great lit up at night, and loved the mural of the royal processional with the music and sound of the horses."
516,4.0,"We had been there in December, was decorated by a lot of light. We passed by during day time and it is not beautiful as night time."
517,4.0,"The stream forms the centerpiece of the urban park, with pathways and plants all along the stream. The stream stretches from Gwanghwamun all the way to Yongdap area. We passed by the stream few times throughout our trip. There was one evening where we took a stroll along the stream from the starting point, Gwanghwamun. That cold winter walk was peaceful. We felt safe to walk along the stream even though not many people were there at that time. We walked all the way to Gwangjang Market to have some local snacks before continuing our walk to Dongdaemun Shopping area.  It was impressive to see how the Koreans managed to rehabilitated the stream. A stream that was once being buried under the Koreans very own process of Industrialisation. It was the success of that same Industrialisation that help the stream resurfaced to see the light of day. Koreans Industrialisation success brought them to have better standard of living, thus rehabilitating more nature to be part of its urban landscape.  Recommend to visit to enjoy a great urban green space."
