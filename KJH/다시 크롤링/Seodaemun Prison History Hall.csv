6,4.0,Recommend to visit The venue is huge and there are many buildings to visit The sun is shining the buildings are grand and Japanese architecture has a sense of beauty If we talk about the shortcomings the wooden prison on the second floor is not open and the other is that there is too much light in the building which makes the interior of the building very bright without the dark and gloomy feeling of the prison under Japanese rule haha
7,5.0,This is not a comfortable museum to visit The experience is sometimes disgusting sometimes horrifying Its the perfect reality check for people who have forgotten what cruelties humans are capable of

13,4.0,One time you can go to get acquainted with the history
14,5.0,Very important place
15,5.0,It is a good idea to take the opportunity of this tour to study the history of Japan and South Korea I myself had the opportunity to find out if Koreas history education for Japan is true The one I put out as a reference photo was taken by me from what was on display around 2006 It shows the state of torture by the police I think its because it turns out that the fact that its changed to something else now isnt true or is too exaggerated It seems that Ryu Gwansun will also be awarded the Order of Merit for National Foundation Republic of Korea as an independent martyr but there are various theories about her and it is said that it is based on the facts from each one It can be said that it is in a difficult state  I hope that the hindrance to friendship between Japan and South Korea will create an atmosphere that will be examined again
16,5.0,What I like about Korea is the way they tell the history in interesting way I do recommend you to watch some movie reference before coming here so you can take the time machine through the tour  I also bought souvenir here it is kinda expensive but I think it is worth it
17,5.0,Memorial place
18,5.0,There was designed and built by Japan while the Japanese colonial period 
19,5.0,I know the historical fact about this place I went there with my daughter and she was surprised by its realistic narratives constructed based on historical evidence Since history requires our awareness to sustain its meaning in our consciousness I think this place deserves our visit
20,3.0,Currently there are restrictions on admission due to the problem of corona infection You cannot enter without prior reservation You can make a reservation from the HP group admission application The tour route is neat and some explanations are in Japanese so even Japanese people can tour At the entrance it is confirmed that you have a reservation or body temperature then you can pay the entrance fee 3000 won and enter by confirming your name and number of people

26,5.0,Sad part of Korea s history
27,5.0,One of my favourite museums in Korea
28,5.0,"This was a very sombering, unique learning experience. Everything was well marked and easy to understand and follow."
29,5.0,"As a Westerner who has lived in Korea for a while, I've been interested in learning more about the Japanese colonial period of the country. This museum provides a lot of interesting information on that period as well as the prison itself. I feel as if this place is a little underrated and should draw more international visitors than it does (granted it's Covid time)."
30,5.0,"Last week, I was able to participate in a night tour of the Prison Hall, complete with poetry reading and song performance based on the poems of the Korean patriots during the Japanese rule. Some of the torture equipment is still present, and you can also experience being caged in a small box barely enough for someone to stand, let alone eat or do anything else. I felt suffocated after a few minutes--I can't imagine being there for hours or days. But perhaps the highlight of the event is the re-enactment of how the Korean prisoners were mentally and physically tortured by the Japanese soldiers. Because of this performance, I was able to get a glimpse of the horrors and bravery of the Korean Independence Fighters. It was a mind-opening tour.  I went here alone last November 2019, before Covid closed most museums, and then came again on a tour with Funday Korea Networks this October 2020. It was nice to visit both day and night. It will probably take around an hour or so to do a tour. Most buildings have English translations but some do not. Both are very nice experience, but I recommend you book a tour guide (when it is available)."
31,5.0,Coming to Korea I was completely ignorant to the history of the country. This trip gives excellent context to the impact the Japanese Occupation had on this country. I’d recommend anyone new to Korea come here.
32,4.0,"We were lucky that we visited a few days before all museums were closed in Seoul. This museum is good to visit on a sunny day as there is quite a bit of outdoor walking required to get from building to building. Overall an interesting and historic place that gives good insights especially about the Japanese occupation. The museum is spread out in several buildings, from main building, guard building and the building with jail cells. In a lot of the cells people who led and fought in the resistance are introduced which gives everything a personal touch. Nearby the museum is a nice pork which is worth a stroll when the weather allows. To get to the museum is fairly easy, a subway station is right there plus many bus stops."
33,4.0,"Last week I went to visit Seodaemun Prison - a former prison that first opened in 1908. It was used during the Japanese colonial era where Korean Freedom Activists were imprisoned and tortured. After the colonial era ended in 1945, the prison was used by Korean government until 1987. In 1992 it became the Seodaemun Prison History Hall where you can learn about those whom were imprisoned during the Japanese Colonial Period. Watching some of the testimonies at the Memorial Hall today of the survivors, and seeing the preserved buildings and historical monuments made me really sad...The stories of the survivors were so touching. If you are in Korea or come to Korea, pay respect to the fallen by visiting this place."
34,5.0,"Historic and informative, took around 1 hour and a half to see everything around the prison. Ticket is 3000 won."
35,4.0,"Prison was in use until the late 1980s. Good discussion of Japanese imperial prisoner treatment, less discussion of post Japanese political prisoners. Some translation available"
36,4.0,"Although not touted as one of the more popular tourist attractions when visiting Seoul, this is worth a visit. Easily accessible via subway (Dongnimum stop) - very short walk from subway exit with signs well marked from subway exit to entrance of site. While there are some english translations, there are portions which are in korean only. There is an app you can download that will give you audio descriptions of certain exhibits but we had a hard time accessing it. Tours in english and other languages can be arranged but when I spoke with the ticket person (my korean, tho not fluent is sufficient so I was able to communicate with people on site to learn this) you need to book a guide at least a month in advance.  There is a main exhibit hall but you will be walking outside to access other buildings within the complex. Some of the buildings are (somewhat heated) but be prepared for cold temps even inside some of the other buildings. (Note we went in winter, but my guess is that in summer, there's no a/c in those buildings so be prepared to deal with heat and humidity in July/Aug) The day we went was particularly cold with temps about 30F/-1C - which gave us a insight into the horrible conditions the prisoners endured.  The exhibit itself provides basic timeline info and good detail into how the prison came to be, to the day to day conditions there. Particularly gruesome is the ""torture"" sections which show the awful physical and mental acts of brutality that was inflicted upon the prisoners.  The other buildings have been preserved and in some of the areas there are tributes and info on some of the political dissidents and leaders that endured (or died) there. But again, some of those sections are only in korean."
37,4.0,This museum is strikingly different from every other historical site that we visted in Korea. It's quite raw in its preservation of the buildings and in its descriptions of the crimes committed here by the Japanese and the Korean miltary government. The photographs in the women's block strike home.
38,4.0,"Well thought out museum that gives an insight into Korea’s history and their relationship to Japan. As others have mentioned, if you are unfortunate enough to coincide your visit with a school tour then this really detracts from the experience. It is difficult to be affected by the torture cell displays when you are surrounded by screaming kids whose teachers do not control them. The museum staff also do not intervene. I also liberated a young man who had been locked in a cell by his ‘friends’."
39,4.0,Very interesting history with a clear anti Japan sentiment coming across through the historical story being told.
40,5.0,"an easy subway stop  spent 2 hours (go later in the morning after the school kids take their tours)  download the app, wifi is free in the buildings  watch the touching videos of former prisoners. there's enough in English about the Japanese occupation"
41,5.0,"It's very easy to get there, by using the Orange subway line, hence I would absolutely recommend going. If gives you an amazing insight, of the status of Korea, during the Japanese occupation. Even if you're not to interested in history, it's worth to pay a visit to get a general view."
42,4.0,"Easy to get to this interesting museum from the City Tour Bus or subway - line 3 (Orange line) to Dongnimmun station, Exit 5 and a very short walk to the entrance. Open from 0930-1800 in the summer months and 0930-1700 in the winter Tuesday - Sunday. Entrance is only 3000 won per adult and, if you are really into history of this time period, it is possible to arrange for a docent guided tour in English, Japanese, or Chinese a week in advance. Recommend reasonable walking shoes and weather appropriate gear as the museum has several buildings to walk between and rain or excessive cold could make it a little uncomfortable. Time spent here varies on your interest in the subject -- there are exhibits enough to spend almost a whole day here however, a good overview could be completed in 1.5 - 3 hours.  The Seodaemun Prison History Hall/museum is separated into several sections that cover 80 years of history (1908 to 1987) of the Seodaemun Prison. The different exhibitions offer information regarding the Korean peoples struggle for independence during the Japanese colonization and the life of those imprisoned by the Japanese in these halls due to their roles in the independence movement. It is a striking presentation of this relatively recent bit of history. Most of the exhibitions have English translations. It does get a little crowded and school groups do come through. Not the first museum I would recommend visiting when in Seoul however, worth it if you have the time."
43,5.0,"This is formally used as a prison during Japanese Colonial Age. Now, it's a history museum for locals and foreign visitors. - The area is huge and there's not enough air conditioning. Try to avoid visiting in hot summer. - Things are well-maintained. Torture cells locating B1F are hideous. - A large Tageukgi(Korean national flag) on the wall of the building is a popular photo spot. Local visitors take photos saying 'manse(hurrah)' as mourning sacrifices in the past - The entrance fee was 3,000 won and it's a bit surprising because many museums or memorial halls in Seoul are free."
44,5.0,"there is so much to learn about what happened during the japanese occupation. this is a prison where koreans supporting the resistance movement were imprisoned and tortured. you can walk through the prison halls where artists, poets, clergy were housed with artifacts from those times. there are recordings (almost couldn't bear listening to the cries that i cried myself) of those that survived the prison. the exhibits show recreations of interrogation rooms. there's lots to read and take in so i would allot at least 2 hours. powerful."
45,5.0,"I was not expecting it to wow me but the setup was actually very good. It was not just empty rooms but displays and explanations of what each room and each building represented during its active days. Huge place as well. It shows how it was before, and the struggle by Koreans just to gain independence. This is one attraction that helps explain why South Koreans are very nationalistic and very proud of their independence."
46,4.0,"We were at Seodaemun Independence Park which leads to the Seodaemun Prison History Hall. We didn’t get to visit the Prison as it was quite late in the afternoon and near the closing time.  The park is like a green oasis compared to the noisy traffic just blocks away.  There is a impressive archway, located at the entrance of the park, which was modelled after the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. This was where previously the envoys sent by the Chinese emperors to Korea were being received.  There are stairs which leads to Dongnimmun metro station. Very convenient."
47,5.0,I would certainly come here if you are in Seoul. Set in a peaceful park it is hard to imagine this was a big prison for Koreans fighting for independence who were kept here by the Japanese. You can going into the cells and learn about the torture endured. It is a huge place. Took us about 2 hours to get around. Most of it is in English but it does sort of give up in a few areas. The main messages were were translated and delivered. There’s a gift shop.
48,4.0,"I was very lucky to have a free tour guide for this. A very intelligent and well spoken kid ( he was only 14! ) was offering free guide for foreigners. Now everything became more meaningful as he went over the entire history of the prison and of Korea during those days. I do understand even better now why Japanese are not well-liked in Korea. Lots of kids with their teachers, which is great. Respect for all the martyrs. Do yourself a favor and visit this place."
49,5.0,Visit with a local or a guide to better understand the history behind the prison hall. We were fortunate to tour the place with Luke from Meteor Youth Voluntary Club. He was well versed with the history and walked us through the exhibits providing interesting information and anecdotes of the famous prisoners incarcerated there. A solemn place indeed makes one marvel again at human courage and self sacrifice of these individuals.
50,5.0,"Nowadays, Koreans can enjoy a modern, democratic and independent country. There are many factors in South Korea’s success. In order to understand why South Korea is the way it is now, we have to look back in the past to see how everything started and to understand a long, painful way Koreans have passed.  Empire of Japan had interests in seizing the Korean peninsula. In 1905, they made Korea their colony, finalizing in effective annexation in 1910. Korean emperor, Gojong, tried to seek for help from western powerful countries but nobody came to the rescue and Japanese could colonized, with violence, Korea. Few can imagine all the suffering and oppression that Koreans had to live during Japanese colonial rule. Japan ruled directly through the military and any Korean dissent was ruthlessly crushed. They build a colonial prison in 1908 that served as a major site of oppression during Japanese forced annexation. Seodaemun Prison, firstly named Gyeongseong Prison, was built to accommodate 500 inmates, considering that the entire capacity of all prisons around the country was of 300 inmates only, but as Japanese full-scale aggression initiated into Korea, many Koreans independence activist started rising. Therefore, these fighters got arrested and imprisoned there, raising the population of the prison reaching more than 3000 people around 1919 as many patriots were imprisoned during the March 1st Independence movement. Until independence was achieved in 1945, many independence fighters were executed or died from the brutal treatment received in the prison.  Metal bars, cold bricks and guards from the prison could not silenced loud voice seeking for restoration of sovereignty nor could break down their loyal spirit inherited from the Righteous Army in the Joseon dynasty. Within the prison’s corridors “Daehan Dongnip Manse!” (Long live the independence of Korea) could always be heard. And little by little, it started uniting all Koreans into one purpose, independence. Korean independence activists created organizations domestically and overseas were they planned resistance strikes. They used many strategies as a method to push forward the recovery of Korea’s national sovereignty, especially the ‘Heroic Struggle’, in my opinion is the smartest tactic that could be done considering the conditions they were living in, which targeted Japanese figures and pro-Japanese Koreans with violence trying to make heavy blows to the Japanese imperialists.  Nowadays, Seodaemun prison is a museum that shows all the pain and struggle that patriots suffer within its prison cells. You can see how their spirit was unbreakable and you can share all the oppression and humiliation caused by Japanese. Even though the prison is empty, the independence patriots’ spirit can still be felt.  100 years has passed since the March 1st Movement rallied the Korean people against oppressive Japanese colonialism. This epoch-making movement, their actions and their activist should never be forgotten because from it we can learn that freedom and peace are not given for free, you must fight for them. We should keep this legacy of our ancestors and treasure it because these are two biggest gifts we could inherit. In order to have a brighter and better future, it is important to learn from our past. As a final remark, we think, Yu Gwan-Sun words: “Even if my fingernails are torn out, my nose and ears are ripped apart, and my legs and arms are crushed, this physical pain does not compare to the pain of losing my nation” wraps the inherit spirit of every Korean."
51,2.0,"In the first building there was at least some general description in English in each display, although the description for the individual items were almost exclusively in Korean. In the second building there is no description at all in English, it’s all in Korean, and very detailed it seems like. I would love to know what they said. I asked the staff if there was a guided tour or an audio guide in English, but no such luck. A lot of the written information in English seems to have gone through Google translate, because sometimes it was tricky to decipher the actual meaning.  There is a lot of focus on the atrocities carried out by the Japanese colonial regime, and rightfully so. But it barely even mentions that it was used for more than 40 years by the South Korean dictatorship which was not known for treating dissidents kindly.  Moreover, there were a lot of schoolchildren running around shouting and laughing, which didn’t feel very respectful."
52,5.0,"It was on 5th May, which is Children Day in Korea, a beautiful day with blue sky, cool breeze and of course holiday break. I awarded myself a visit to Seodaemun prison to know more about Korean history and I was so curious to discover a different part of Seoul. This place seems like to be out of the beaten track for many tourists visiting Seoul, including myself. Before coming to Korea, I have not heard about Seodaemun prison. Seodaemun used to be a prison since 1910 by Japanese to torture and later execute Korean Independence Movement followers. The first thought pop into my mind was that this place would be scary, dark and horrible, and it was indeed horrible and terrifying once I entered the museum. I feel a bit guilty to say this but for someone having no idea about Seodaemun’s history; however, this place is a hidden gem of a hustle and bustle Seoul, stunning red-bricks halls, large playing ground with some green corners with a green grass field, trees and flowers… It was a bit crowded today, many school students and families visiting (probably because it was on Sunday and Children Day). I walked around the courtyard first, enjoying the nice weather and alive vibe at the courtyard. Walking around, I did not believe that these buildings used to be a horrific hell, where people were jailed, starved, tortured and killed. All the nicely elegant appearance outside of these red-brick wall buildings was completely deceitful. Inside the exhibition hall, there was a number of artefacts grouped into several displays, relating to the Independence Movement in Korea and the terrible mistreatment and torture of Japanese during their colony period. The basement under exhibition hall was not the place for the faint of a heart person, it was extremely unthinkable acting of violence. I have seen these terribly horribly unsympathetic torture methods for many times, but I still could not stand with it for any seconds. It was so dreadful that I just wanted to get out. I watched the video of an old man who was a Korean patriot. Seeing what he suffered after being ceiled here in Seodaemun, I just could not hold my tear and I do not think any of us can fully understand the hardship he and other people hold here suffered and their strong belief and determination to fight for the independence of their country and for freedom and happiness of their people. I still remember his saying “I am happy now because all Korean people are now happy”. Seodaemun prison was now served as the special museum in remembrance of the dark history of Korean and Korean patriots. This place could be a bit of propaganda against the Japanese to someone. Just leaving the anti-Japanese attitudes I so often hear, however, this place, filled with its dark history, is a historic place to teach people, especially youths, about the sacrifice that made up Korea today, the value of independence and freedom and the horror of the war. Personally, this visit was an emotional experience, knowing more about the history of Korean people and discovering another part of Seoul. As Winston Churchill said, “Those that fail to learn from history, are doomed to repeat it”. So, I do hope that there will be no more wars around the world and there will be no such horrific mistreatment that happened here in Seodaemun will be repeated any other places.  How to get there: [Subway] Dongnimmun Station (Seoul Subway Line 3), Exit 5. You can easily see the guidance to the entrance of prison right after leaving exit 5."
53,5.0,"Easy access-right off of Dongnimun subway stop. Brought my teenage son so he could get a sense of the Japanese occupation and the Korean resistance movement. We had visited the Seoul Museum of History the day before, but the Seodaemun Prison History Hall truly brought the content alive. There’s no comparison to walking the actual grounds where political prisoners were once held. As others have commented, I only wish more of the exhibits were translated to English. Also I noticed there were tributes to student/worker/pro democracy activists, but they were only in Korean, and I wish I could’ve understood what they said."
54,5.0,The place is starting to get crowded because they are celebrating their March 1 Independence movement. You can tour the whole facility for 45mins - 1.5hrs. Close to Seodaemun Independence park.
55,4.0,"A visit to the Seodaemun Prison will leave a lasting impression. We went on a calm Sunday morning. From the subway station (exit 5) you will walk straight to the former prison. The museum details the cruelties commited by the Japanese in the early 20th century, but gives little information about the time when the prison was in use during the second half when a lot of Koreans whom critiques the Korean government were imprisoned there."
56,4.0,"Take the subway to the Dongnimmun station on the orange line. Leave through exit 5 and when you come to street level you can see the wall of the prison and easily follow signs to the entrance. The exhibits were interesting and moving. Most of the placards are in several languages, including English, so it's easy to follow along. I was disappointed that one of the prison halls with stories of individual prisoners only had information in Korean but there was plenty to see otherwise. If you're unfamiliar with the Japanese occupation of Korea I recommend doing a little reading about it before your visit. I had just finished reading ""The Living Reed"" by Pearl S. Buck and it made my visit there so much more meaningful. I also recommend following the route in the pamphlet they give you to completion. Some of the most interesting and moving exhibits were at the end.  I had the same unfortunate experience with loud groups of school children (there were at least 3 large groups there) as another reviewer. Trying to experience a museum while large groups are moving through at the same time is not something I enjoy. However, I had started the museum around 1pm which is a common time for field trips to arrive. After the exhibits in the central building I took a break outside and sat in the shade for a bit. Walking around after 2pm was much easier. Some of the groups had left and the remaining ones had spread out. So if you find yourself bothered by large groups I suggest just waiting a bit."
57,5.0,"I can't believe how amazing this museum is, absolutely chilling and surreal. It's so important to intake in the history of the country you are visiting and I had an unforgettable experience. I also had a local with me as some parts are in Korean and he was able to read and explain it to me. However be warned this can be a very emotional experience."
58,5.0,"A place which reminds South Koreans of the brutal colonial rule of Japan. A nice place to see what Koreans suffered before earning their independence. A place to show respect. People are free to take photos, but it is important to remember that people died of torture here."
59,5.0,"This prison history hall wasn't on our radar for our first visit to Seoul but for our second trip I was looking for something a little different, to discover more of the history of Seoul, and we certainly got it here. Seodaemun Prison operated from 1908 to 1987, in 1988 it was designated National Historic Relic No.324, then in 1998 the History Hall was opened.  The Prison History Hall is located in Seodaemun-gu, easily to accessed by Subway Line 3, Dongnimmun Station, from here it is a short walk. Our self-guided tour prison history hall complex cost 3000 won each and lasted 1.25 hours using the brochure that we were given at the ticket office. There was plenty of the information to read (Korean and English text), the displays were excellent and conveyed the significance and at times were quite emotional. The torture chamber was the most alarming with descriptions of the variety of tortures conducted on prisoners, at times with sound effects. On the day of our visit the museum was well attended by nationals, young and old, and families. A very interesting morning."
60,4.0,"We have been to many prisons around the world, and this one had its own unique way to memorialize its prisoners. Instead of death masks or head molds we have seen elsewhere (of newly executed prisoners), here we saw many molds of prisoners’ feet. These were presented on individual prisoner plaques, with a three-dimensional view of the bottoms of their feet."
61,1.0,"I was really excited about seeing this. As we walked around, there were no less than 50 groups of children (likely on field trips from school). The children were running around, screaming, and in my opinion, being completely disrespectful in an area where many people died so that they could have freedom. Their teachers largely ignored the behavior, and used microphones with speakers to talk to the children creating such a loud a chaotic environment that we could not possibly concentrate on the tour. The reason why I give it one star is because even though there were signs all over asking for people to be quiet and there were staff members in every room, I didn't see single staff member as the children or teachers to abide by the signs and be quiet. We left with headaches, shame :("
62,5.0,This was another find by accident. We spent a full day here and had a day of sadness & amazement of the human spirit. The people were so badly treated but seem to still keep their spirit and pride.
63,5.0,"You may need to toughtlen up a little bit when you come here, but overall, it's a very good experience when you want to learn about Korea. However, there are some texts without English :( Despite that, I still enjoyed my time here. There are only few tourists around. Most people who were there when I came were students and those who are in their mandatory military training. So if you want to stay off the touristy track, do come to this place. Admission is only 3,000₩. :)"
64,5.0,"We originally decided to visit here to fill in time, and so glad we did. The whole site has been refurbished and takes at least an hour to complete the route they suggest. Very good displays and explanations in English for us. As you walk around you could imagine what it would have been like for the prisoners under Japanese rule. Usually places like this only keep 1 or 2 buildings as a museum and destroy the rest but here you get to view basically the full occupied site."
65,5.0,If u r interested in history of Korea u have to visit this place. The place is an old prison used during war agains activist. U may see torture and u ll feel how was hard for them to live there. And in addition if u r so sensitive u may be feel bad.
66,4.0,"This location does not really pop out when one searches for places to see in Seoul. This historical site is very touching and biographies of those who have suffered under Japanese Colonial rule is very sad. Tour of all the buildings and walking the ground should take about 1-2 hours.  3,000 won for Adults 1,500 won for Teenagers 1,000 won for Children 1,500 won for Soldiers"
67,3.0,"Visiting on a very cold winter day, it was a very sombre place that outlines the history of the Japanese rule over Korea. Womens underground prison was interesting and the details that keep the memory of the suffering alive are interesting. Not the best English translations, but you get the general idea in the selection of exhibits and information on display. The metal die casts of feet; photography images and small artifacts paint a sad picture of the unsettled time in Korean history. We visited while half the place was out of bounds due to a festival rehearsal, but the stunning voices of the opera singers throughout the dreary halls of prison cells seemed fitting somehow and made the experience better! Subway station directly at the main gate; basic toilet facilities and a small souvenir shop. Not the best museum in the city but definitely worth a visit."
68,3.0,"Prison was overall interesting and I could feel the solemn atmosphere of the different spots. However, they are not as inclusive in the sense that a lot of the signages are still untranslated and it makes me feel that I am missing out a little on the small details."
69,5.0,"Seodaemun Prison History Hall is a monument of Korean history which chronologically illustrates Korean history of last 110 years. That alone is a reason why visitors of Seoul must visit that place. By visiting it, each individual can understand that part of Korean history and incredible power of will of Korean people to stand for themselfs. So it is a must see attraction in Seoul😀"
70,4.0,"Very close to the station - worth a visit. Unfortunately not everything in English, only really the sections about the torture/horrendous acts undertaken there. If you like to read everything at museums you may be a little disappointed. If you only have time for one museum I would go to the war museum but if you have time then definitely come here."
71,4.0,"This should be a top attraction in Korea. The prison is actually a museum, that depicts not only the facilities of the prison and the atrocities perpetrated in it, with graphic pictures and, mostly, reconstruction of tortures with dummies, but also tells us the history of Korea's occupation by Japan (1910-1945). It is well organized and therefore easy to follow. Not everything is also in English but most of it is. The caveat is that I found it a little biased. It focuses strongly on the Japanese era and clearly is a strong criticism to that, which is OK. However, there is nothing about the period 1945-1987, during which the prison was run by Korea, after their freedom from Japanese occupation."
72,4.0,"The exhibits are well presented and many have English descriptions. Also, the route is well marked, so it is easy to follow.  Visited during a school vacation, so there were groups of children visiting. They were quite noisy despite many signs with 'be quiet' (in English and Korean), but the museum workers did not seem to care. Seemed a bit inappropriate in a place like this. To be fair, this becomes less of a problem once you get out of the main exhibit building.  Also, the presentation seems a bit one-sided, as it focuses strongly on the Japanese occupation and the crimes committed during this period.  For example, some (more 'neutral') exhibits have only Korean descriptions, but most about particularly bad torture or mistreatment of inmates also have descriptions in English, Chinese and (of course) Japanese.  No-one can deny that the occupation was terrible, but the facility was also used as a prison by Korean governments until 1987. Little information is given about the 40+ years after WW2.  Still, very educational and well worth a visit."
73,5.0,"The prison museum and the surrounding area is interesting and for photographers a good place to visit. I also entered the woods in the hills behind the prison and found some flowers and bugs to photograph. The bugs were quite easy to photograph. Patient and still while I was photographing them. A tip for photographers here, for close up photography I got better results with my smartphone at close distance than with my dedicated cameras.  The only drawback was lot of mosquito bites we had on this visit ;)"
74,4.0,"I have been to Korea so many times, we hit all the top tourist places...decided to check this out with my son. It was a bit chilling knowing all the suffering that took place...not only at the hands of the Japanese, which was absolutely atrocious...but also at the hands of the various Korean governments which was just as bad. It was sad thinking back to the suffering of the Korean people had to endure throughout history...recommended to understand Korean history better."
75,4.0,"Firstly make sure you don't come on a Monday like I did as I found it closed (I should had known to check) I did return the following day thou, well presented and once again minimal cost to the attraction gives a good overview of how the prison adapted to the required changes over time with Japan's occupation. If you are interested in these sort of attractions certainly worth a couple of hours spent here."
76,4.0,Travelled to the museum from myeongdong for under USD6. Museum is tourist friendly with descriptions in English. The tour route is nicely planned to so you wont have to wander around and just follow the arrows. We were lucky that there was an exibition on the student uprising which was very interesting. Per person cost about 2400 korean won
77,5.0,Really enjoyed the enjoyed the gardens which this building is situated. Some excellent picture taking. The emotional story is well described too.
78,4.0,"Lively educational facility that demonstrates and memorialize the efforts paid by the people who struggled for independence. The prison was designed by the Japanese. It showed the prison lives and the brutality of the Japanese. Detail descriptions in Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese."
79,5.0,"It was a worthwhile trip and educational for us as we learnt about the prisoners of war and how they were tortured. We were able to see the cells too, the gallows and many more. Good experience!!"
80,4.0,"This is one of the only Museums that you have to pay for, but even so I have been to this place three times now. The compound is a nice escape from the busy streets of Seoul and the information inside is very educational. They have pamphlets in English, Chinese, and Japanese. Most of the information panels are in English and Hangul. However, the prisoner stories tend to only be in Korean."
81,4.0,"It feels like going back and living in the past. It was -4 degrees Celsius when we visited, I can feel how cold or how hot it will be to be in one of the narrow prison cells. Passing through the torture room was spine chilling/hair raising. It was sad to know the human cruelty experienced during war. I admired Koreans for the bravery and for the love of their country.  We were amazed by how the prison building and other things during the war was well preserved.  Walking distance from subway station Dongnimmun St. Exit 5, A map guide to the prison history hall.  Before exiting the Prison History hall, there is a souvenir shop near the rest room and the exit gate.  Not all information are translated in English :("
82,4.0,"A very enjoyable experience that has both hangul and english lettering as tour the facilities. When I went there was no guided tour, but it was easy to find your way around in the intended path as a result of arrows/signage. Incredibly cheap when I went, only 3,000 KRW and right off the subway line! Great for an afternoon visit."
83,5.0,"This former prison and history hall shows what lead up to the Japanese occupation in Korea in 1910 and what happened after that. It's a very sad history but will make you thankful for the blessings that you have. You'll see where prisoners, who fought against the Japanese soldiers were tortured, put into prison, biographies of male and female prisoners, and pictures of the people that died there. It's a sad reminder of how evil war can be.  You can visit this place within an hour to an hour and a half. It's closed on Mondays (if a holiday falls on Monday then it's open on the holiday but closed on Tuesday). The hours are from 9:30-6:00pm from March to October and 9:30-5:00pm from November to February. The cost is ₩3,000 for adults, ₩1,500 for youth between 13-18, and ₩1,000 for children between 7-12. However I wouldn't recommend bringing young children here.  It's located at Dongnimmun Station (Line 3), Exit 5."
84,4.0,"Seodaemun Prison is well worth a visit to get a perspective of the Japanese treatment of Koreans during the occupation (1895-1945). Very interesting factual information and models give you a real life perspective of what it was like and how prisoners were treated. The wall of prisoner photographs brings you to the stark reality that young or old, you could find yourself imprisoned here - or worse...."
85,4.0,"Right by Dongnimmun St. Exit 5. Entrnace fee is 3,000 KRW. There is a small gift shop with good souvenirs from the place. Two floors. Good piece of history"
86,4.0,"Every country had a war , revolution or something like that. But when you see the real places understand life has a bitter taste for them. Dont miss the photo gallery at the end of museum."
87,4.0,"dont expect lots of artefact, this prison is standing to remind every Koreans that not so long ago Japanese came and tried to exterminate their freedom. If you are not Japanese, you should go and pay respect. visit the adjacent building where people were put to death (hanging) and realize how much different Korea has become today."
88,5.0,"Unlike other reviews I felt a little disappointed with the availability of English translations (about 2/3rd of all signs) or English subtitles on videos (only 1 out of 4/5) as without a guide I'd like to read everything to get a good understanding of what's on display. Nonetheless gives the museum a good impression of the horrible time during Japanese suppression. Spent about 2,5 hours. Entrance fee is comparable to other museums, couple of Euros per person."
89,4.0,"I found this a very educational visit as I knew little of the Japanese rule over Korea. Most of the information was in English - not everything, but definitely enough to make this place a worthwhile place to visit. The park next door is a nice place to wander through too."
90,5.0,The prison is in a little memorial parc that is definitely worth visiting. There are free guided tours done by students who want to learn english - so not a professional tour but quite good. The visit is well organised and everything is in both Korean and English. It's quite sad to see everything that happened in Korea and to all of those men and women who only wanted freedom. You won't leave that place unaffected and it'll make you realise that freedom should never be taken for granted. Amazing place. It'll take you a few hours to visit the whole prison.
91,4.0,"Came here upon recommendation by a friend, and it didn't disappoint. It was a wonderful learning visit, but a little heart wrenching at some point. Definitely a place for history lovers. Spent about 2hours here, after reading all the English descriptions that was available; some exhibits didn't.  The site was easy to find from Dongnimmun station. After paying 3000won for the entry, I was free to explore the grounds. The first block was a kind of a introductory exhibit where the history of the prison was introduced.  There were many blocks on the ground. However, there was a certain flow indicated to tell you which block to go to next everytime you exited one. It felt like I was moving through a story, and it helped me to not miss out any exhibits.  I happened to visit on the day when many schools trips were taking place. Groups and groups of students were all over. It got a tad annoying because they were noisy (didn't help when I was trying to have a moment of silence). But, their noise and chattering was appreciated I was walking through the eerie torture chamber and execution house. Those places sent chills down my spine, and good thing there was laughter around to lighten the mood a little."
92,5.0,"We quite like these sorts of things when travelling, and this one didn't disappoint! Although it was quite emotional to see what the Koreans went through under Japanese rule. But was definitely an eye opener."
93,5.0,This is a museum of Korean life under Japanese occupation. There are lots to see and well worth a visit. Use line 3 and short walk from the station.
94,4.0,"We went on a tour with an english speaking guide which made it much more interesting. Some of the signs are in english, but not all. This prison was used during the Japanese occupation and then after independence it was used as a regular prison until just before the Olympics (1987). You certainly hear a lot about the brutality of the Japanese during this time and they spirit of the Koreans who fought against it. It is certainly horrible to see how people were kept in tiny cramped cells and the torture they endured, just because they wanted their country to be free. We didn't hear so much about how the prison was operated after the Japanese left or what sort of people were kept there. Much of the prison has been rebuilt as a memorial for future generations. It is in a very nice park at the foot of a Mountain. It is easily accessible from/right next to, Dongnimmum metro station and costs about W3000 to get in. Only for those with a particular interest in such things."
95,4.0,"A very interesting museum that takes a visitor from the colonial period through the 1980s. The story of Korean nationalism plays out through the displays. While there is little regarding the prison's use during the period following liberation, I was pleased to at least see some acknowledgment of the abuses suffered at that time by reformers. While the preponderance of the displays are in Korean only (this is Korea, after all), there are still enough English languages boards to inform the English-speaking visitor. This is a well done museum and a recommended stop for a visitor to Seoul - especially one who wants to understand the still-strained relationship with Japan and the emergent Korean nationalism that was torn apart in the Korean War."
96,3.0,First reaction better than last. I wouldn't do this over other attractions. It's light on English details and very recreated v authentic. Good quick history lesson.
97,5.0,"Amazing complex not far from the city center that tells a lot of the hardship korea had to face while under japanese occupation.Shocking to see what humans are able to do to each other,but thru this hopefully we are able to learn.After all it is a prison,and it gives a feeling of sadness but also in a good sense."
98,5.0,"We visited this early in the morning with at least two school groups. The prison was well preserved and all the placards had very good English explanations. It took us about 2 hours to walk through. I found it a sad history and interesting insight into the way the Japanese attempted to suppress the spirit of the Korean people. The school groups were fun to watch as the engaged with the various exhibits. Go, it helps to tie the occupational history to the Korean War and see the beginnings of separate states."
99,4.0,Very nice place considering the genre. We were met by a volunteer tour guide who spoke excellent English and was very up on the history of the prison. It was a good place to spend the day learning a little history.
100,5.0,"This place most certainly reached my expectations.  The entrance to Seodaemun Prison Hall starts off with some background information. The entire area itself is large with several of buildings to visit.  After the entrance building is where all the creepiness begins. I felt myself shiver as I walked through the other buildings. I recall seeing an entire row of cells and the silence adds up to the creepiness. There's also a hospital, memorial hall, and work out area that was all part of the history. There were also hand prints and image of each of the deceased.  Along with feeling scared, was also a wave of sadness. You get to read personal notes written by those held captive which truly gives you an insight of the horrors. There are some small clips that briefly summarize the horrors.  I absolutely loved this place. It's like watching an incredible historical bloody movie. Scary but intriguing. Not recommended to those with the faintest heart."
101,3.0,"I guess it is a must for people that are into WWII stuff and history. It is well preserved, depicting specially the struggles of the more than 3,000 ""martyrs"" imprisioned there during the Japanese occupation of Korea, from 1910 to 1935. There is a whole section of the prison where the instruments of tortured are showed, plus testimonies, pictures, etc. Although you can follow in English, pretty much, there is a lot of stuff in Korean that it is not translated. Pretty shocking and graphic, make the actual American debate about ""water boarding"" a joke. It is not for everybody. I won't recommend it unless there is a specific interest."
102,3.0,"The prison and grounds are kept in good condition. The red brick buildings are somewhat unique here in Korea, so I enjoyed looking around them. The prison has been restored to the point that it's almost hard to imagine it as a place of torture and despair. They have recreations of various torture methods used. You can see the exercise grounds where prisoners were separated by walls while exercising, the execution room, and the secret tunnel used to carry bodies out.  I am not giving this a better review for two reasons: while many signs were in English and in Korean, there were enough signs that were only in Korean that I felt like I was missing out on some really interesting stories. The other, and more important reason, is that it is so one-sided that it feels like a nostalgic, naive look back on Korean patriots rather than an objective history museum. While that nostalgia doesn't need to be completely eliminated, it should have been much more balanced. I would have liked to have heard about the Japanese guards and their lives, during and after. I really think they should have talked more about the prison after the Japanese occupation more. Who were the prisoners under the newly formed Korean government and how were they treated then? Was it similar to how the Japanese treated prisoners? I know the new Korean government had a massive crackdown on dissidents, but they are barely mentioned.  If you are interested in prisons or the Japanese occupation, I would still recommend this because it is a unique look into an important part of Korean history."
103,5.0,Our visit to the prison was one of the most humbling experiences we had. The prison was used for political dissidents under Japanese rule and visiting the museum revealed the depths of human nature.  I maybe wouldn't recommend going with children that are really young as some things can be quite could be upsetting. But for anyone who is interested in Japanese/Korean history this is a must see.  The museum is one of the most interesting we have visited. It is rare that I find myself reading every display in a museum but I did at Seodaemun Prison.
104,5.0,"We really enjoyed our tour here, led by a young volunteer that spoke excellent english. A must see place in Seoul for those who are history minded."
105,5.0,"Trying to fill my time I came across this location in my guide book and it was worth the visit. For 3,000 won you get to walk around this huge prison museum and see the suffering Koreans endured during Japanese occupation. You may need 1.5 hours to tour this huge place. Great visuals with pictures and recreations of torturous methods used on prisoners."
106,5.0,"The halls, the cells, the buildings, the stories and the displays will open your eyes to a dark period of Korean history but rather than focusing on the gruesomeness of the events that took place here, take a moment to reflect and understand the struggle for Korean Independence, the pride Koreans have for their country. It's a solemn place so place be respectful. keep quiet and use this visit to learn more and understand Korea better."
107,4.0,"Very well maintained, a lot of nice artifacts and displays. Very friendly workers. A nice place to visit to learn more about a different somewhat tilted side of Korean history. Only drawback too much emphasis on how great and how hard the righteous Korean people fought off the yoke of Japanese occupation. Nothing mentioned about the United States defeating the Japanese for Korea to regain its independence, or how many Koreans were snitches and spies who worked for the Japanese Kempeitai. Nothing mentioned about how many teenagers President Park Chung Hee imprisoned there when he was president for tearing down a political poster and beaten to confess that it was his father’s idea (my father-in-law) to do that like what happened to my brother-in-law in 1971. Overall a very nice day trip in conjunction with a walk down to Independence Park."
108,4.0,I wandered to the prison one day when I had a few hours to spare. It was a hard to face reality of the Japanese occupation. But it is part of the history and I did see many young families there. There were wax figures in the torture section that may be scary to young children. (It can be bypassed since the walk is self guided). There is a replica of the prison exercise yard and several of the cell blocks. Not much in English - but really not needed.
109,4.0,To be done your last day in Seoul. Shows how corean prisoners were treated by the Japanese. Edifying.
110,4.0,"This is an interesting prison well layed out and easy to get to on the metro, Dongnimmun station. Located close to other major sights it is worth a visit if you like history and only takes a couple of hours. Not all the information is in English but most is. The museum covers the time of the Japanese occupation and includes a section on torture, so emotive but presented in a informative way."
111,4.0,"Old prison from the Japanese colonial era turned into a museum. There is a lot of information, signage also available in English. There is also a large portion of the outside grounds available to walk around and see. Even though I went on a weekend, it wasn't very crowded as it isn't a top tourist attraction, though I do suggest a visit here to see a different side of Seoul and it's history. The whole complex can easily be seen in little more than one hour. Photos are allowed."
112,3.0,"Interesting landmark in Seoul; I think it would clearer if they changed the name to the Korean Patriot History Hall because that is what the museum truly focuses on. If you are expecting an Alcatraz-type tour, you will be disappointed."
113,5.0,Sobering reminder of the struggle that this county endured for its independence. Amazing juxtaposition in looking at the grounds of the prison yard with the skyscrapers and apartment complexes nearby.
114,4.0,Glad we went to get to see the culture and history. The hall had a lot of different buildings to walk around and get different perspectives from different stories. Very informative and interactive.
115,4.0,"My trip to Korea doesn’t stop at garden, villages and good food. I took a detour to a prison in Seoul. This is Seodaemun prison, among the largest prison in Seoul in the past era, when South Korea is still under Japanese colonization. You can’t get too excited on the main gates. It has a watch tower, lovely red bricks wall and a metal. That is about it. Let’s go in, I am sure there are “nostalgic” stuff within. Visitors are immediately greeted with some of the tools used for locking up prisoners. The next section bring us to some interrogation chamber, torture chambers where we witness how Japanese forcing the prisoners or detainee to admit wrong-doing that they didn’t commit. I move on to visit the actual cell where prisoners kept. The classic scary element is there - long aisle, dim interior, and the metal clanking noise upon door swinging open. Many people died here. The atmosphere may be calm and peace, but we are constantly reminded of the remaining lingering soul and ghost."
116,4.0,Interesting place. Easy to walk around in a couple of hours. Tells a very interesting story of the effects of the Japanese rule. I would have liked to hear the eye witness accounts from the prisoners but they were only available in Korean. Interesting explanations of some of the things the Japanese did to ensure they maintained absolute control over the Korean prisoners.
117,3.0,"Seodaemun Prison is a unique attraction amongst all the towers, temples, museums or palaces you might have the opportunity to visit in Korea. It's definitely worth visiting. The surrounding Seodeamun Independence Park (with its statues, grass paths, pools) is also nice and the prison sits it very nicely. The prison is a great yet troubling and horrifying way to learn about Korea's complex history. However, keep in mind that visiting the prison doesn't take more than an hour. And while many museums in Korea are foreigner-friendly, with a lot of explanations in English, the prison overall lacks context. This is especially regrettable because for people who might not be well familiar with the Japanese occupation of Korea, they might miss on what this museum trully means and represents. Finally, while most major museums in Korea are free, the prison, while also public, costs 3000 KRW to visit. Not expensive, but still surprising that you have to pay more to visit this than the National Museum of Korea for example..."
118,4.0,"The Seodaemun Prison History Hall is an epic monument that clearly shows the evil nature of the Japanese captors because there are dozens of torture chambers and methods that were used against Koreans. Yes, the Japanese did much worse when they burned down Royal Palaces and tried to erase Korean History, but nothing remains from those atrocities. Here, for example, you can see or actually step into these horrific caskets used for psychological torture. There are many other examples of how Koreans were enslaved in this museum. It's so real, you'll feel it. One of the better remnants that tells the truth of history through meticulous preservation. Plz go if you have the time..."
119,4.0,A well-maintained and informative place to learn a bit about one aspect of Korea's history. Quite a large compound which took around 1-2 hours to explore and even had a free digital photo booth for you to use as a souvenir.
120,3.0,"I am glad that I took the time to visit this spot. It's not on my top 10 list of things to see in Seoul, but it did help me to gain some insight into the animosity between South Korea and Japan."
121,4.0,This place was used to be a prison when Korea was under the Japanese administration. It shows cruelty of Japanese and you can feel the spirit of the old Korean people who worked for the independence.
122,4.0,"Off the beaten path (and less busy) compared to some of the main attractions but it's a gem of a place. This place should be ranked higher on the list of attractions in Seoul. It's a very moving place with a lot of great information about Japan's occupation of Korea and there are bunch of buildings to look through.  Random Information: Cost was 3,000won for 1 adult. Plan to spend 1-2 hours here. There were vending machines with drinks available. Small gift shop at the end of your self-guided tour. One of the lesser busy places to visit on the weekend."
123,5.0,I found the whole museum to be a fascinating place to visit. The reminders of the Japanese occupation of Korea and the cruelty inflicted upon the Korean people were blatant and graphic. Also the era of Korean history where despotic military leaders imprisoned anyone who spoke out against the regime. The prison museum is in tact and provides a chilling reminder of life behind bars right up to 1987.
124,5.0,"This attraction is a must-do for anyone interested in history. There is not a lot of information provided in English in the museum, but the story of the torture and imprisonment which took place here is made clear. The basement of the museum building is where the actual torture took place - seeing the life-sized figures in the cells and hearing the soundtrack of someone screaming gave me goosebumps! The little hut where those found guilty were executed is also very poignant. The cell block and exercise yards are the other points of interest. The prison is a bit out of the way, but a really interesting and moving place to visit if you get a chance."
125,5.0,"A great museum, and a good lesson in the history between Japan and South Korea. It really touches your heart, and you can feel the despair in the walls."
126,4.0,Interesting way to spend an hour or so. Nice film and displays. But for most people not a primary attraction. Suggest combining it with a visit to a nearby Palace. Easy to get to by subway.
127,4.0,"I visited this attraction because I am a huge history buff. The prison was built in the early 20th century and it gives an idea of what life was like for prisoners during Korea's colonial period.  You can walk the grounds, and you can step foot inside the cells. There are mannequins depicting the horrible atrocities committed against the prisoners. There is even an opportunity to stand inside one of the Korean torture devices, which is a cubby hole (read: small closet) without any extra room. If you are over five feet, nine inches tall you are going to be extremely uncomfortable in this thing! And we read that some prisoners were left in there for days!  We hired a tour guide who spoke excellent English. He walked us through the various buildings and rooms. He explained what life was like for the prisoners back when the facilities were in operation.  Seoul is an exciting and bustling city. The streets along the main thoroughfares are clean and the infrastructure can handle the population's mobility. Visiting this ancient prison was like stepping into a time warp. You certainly got a feel for a time that has since passed.  I would recommend this attraction. You only need to spend two hours there, at the most. But be sure to get a guide. The memories will last forever."
