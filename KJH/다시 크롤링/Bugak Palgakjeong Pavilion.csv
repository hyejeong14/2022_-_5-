7,1.0,The worst service crew in Seoul She yells at customers and forces everyone orders at least one drink I had to order a extra coffee which no one needed in my group I asked for a Togo cup to take it out Then she told me to bring the cup from the pickup desk to inside of the kitchen to get the coffee poured in a Togo cup  I felt so uncomfortable walking inside of their dirty kitchen simply to get a paper cup

32,5.0,We went for a walk to check this place out. It turned out to be awesome day. We ended up hiking all around the area getting to look out points and received amazing photo's. The hiking paths were probably my favourite of the whole trip.
33,4.0,"This the pavilion area locating on top of Bugak Skyway(road passing on Bugaksan Mountain). It has a spectacular view of Seoul and there are some places to have fun or eat. Fine place in Seoul. - No access available by bus/metro. Arriving by a car is recommended. But, climbing from Sukjeongmun Gate is a good hiking of 30~40 min. Also, reaching along Bugaksan Skyway is available. - It has a really nice panoramic view of Seoul. - The pavilion itself has telescopes, cafe and restaurant. You can also grab a bite from a small supermarket in the area."
34,4.0,"This pavillon is located on the Bugak mountain. Very nice to enjoy northern part of Seoul. Night view is also good. This is very famous place as a observatory like Seoul tower, but not easy without a car. If you like hiking, you can walk along the road, enjoying Seoul old fortress from a distance. Or you take the taxi near Gyeongbokgung palace, direction to the Blue House. By taxi 20 min max, and US$10 approx. Then, come down on foot(doming down is easier). It takes apprx. 30-40 min from the pavillion to Blue house. Pavillion is famous for the moon watching for the moon festival or praying wishes for new year, etc. Since it is located near the Blue house, you might meet some police, simply you answer them, you are going to Palgakjung. North Korean spies came down through this mountain in 1968, to attack The Blue House. Among 31 guerilla spies, only one person survived. Anyway, Worth to visit at least once you are in Seoul. In the winter, you can encouter scenic view covered snows. There are several restaurants and convenient stores. Parking lot available. Pavillion itself, as far as I know 24 hours open to visit."
