47,5.0,Lottery Department was not what I used to go it was very very crowded at this time of year But they display beautiful fresh food and luxury items as ever Being there always make me feel happy
48,4.0,The mall is huge and you can buy almost anything you need. Parking is not difficult with payment deferred if you shop. The supermarket is also big and complete. Lines are not too long and there is a tax refund options if you bring your passport. You can spend the whole day here with a lot of food choices and variety of stores.
49,5.0,"This department store has basically everything you need. From mid range to luxury fashion items. Various range of restaurants in the food court. But for now , clothes are mostly geared for winter. At the same period , most bases are covered."
50,5.0,Very big department store for shopping. Many options of Korean brands & international brands. A lot of food selection and Korean deserts. Located at the heart of Myongdong area
51,4.0,See many Tourist buying Cosmetic in bulk. Many bring along the big luggage with wheel. Was at the cosmetic level and it's clouded. Can see some sitting on the floor near toilet for rest and transfer shopped items into the luggage ready for next round of shopping. Some branded sunglasses also giving good discount.
52,2.0,"If you’re looking for authentic Korean items, this is not the ideal place to shop. However, if your goal is to shop for high-end items that are available elsewhere for better prices, then you would enjoy shopping here. I was looking for Korean brands and unfortunately, not many were around the store. I ended up crossing the street and shopping at Myeongdong instead.  The Food Court, on the other hand, is a different story. Filled with so many choices from savory items, Korean coffee, pastries and confectionery, it’s a haven for foodies. There are also a few places to eat that offer delicious food."
53,1.0,I went at 12 F and looked for cosmetic product. The staff there dont even know english. And when i asked this one counter. Cannot remember what the shop name. But its near escalator. Maybe pop up store. She was playing with her phone. Then i asked few times and she refused to answer my questions. Keep on playing with her phone. Then after few times then she answered its a toner without looking at my face. And keep playing the phone. Really disappointed with what happen.
54,5.0,"Every floor in this store is eye candy for a shopper. Every brand I’ve ever heard of and many I haven’t can been found here. I bought an adorable purse from a Japanese women’s golf clothing designer. They have a huge makeup and skincare department, and even a Lush Bath and Body section. Then there’s the basement. It’s a grocery store, food hall, and confectionery. It’s huge and it’s a delight to the senses."
55,4.0,You can find everything in this mall Mall that is close to Seoul Station. Very easy to get and also very large to shopping in.
56,5.0,"We""ve spend 1.5 hours there. A bit expensive, but very posh. Nice clean and a lot of brands there. Not many people. Parking in front with parking service."
57,4.0,"The mall is huge and will take a few hours at least to walk though every level and every wing.  Lots of international brands and boutiques charging prices that are more or less the same anywhere else in Asia, even if you factor in the tax rebate.  There are some floors dedicated to local designers and brands and even those seemed very pricey to me. I looked at some casual weekend dresses and that ranged from about KRW 250k (USD 200) and upwards going to multiples of that amount.  The best part of this mall is the basement food level. Lots to see and choose and try. Similar to the foodhalls you would find in Malls in Tokyo or Harrods in London. I enjoyed browsing and choosing gifts for friends and family. I snacked on quite a few things as I went along.  Lovely few hours I spend in there but did actually buy much other than food and gifts."
58,4.0,"Of course the store sells all the items expected of any and all high-end retailers which one can find almost anywhere in the world -- but the basement food hall and grocery store is worth the trip. Yes, you can purchase ""street foods"" and sit in the dining hall to consumer, or peruse the limitless items in the grocery to take home to cook yourself. Either way, foodies will love this place -- though we have found prices of identical grocery items to be a bit less expensive at the Shinsegae Department Store a few blocks away."
59,5.0,"I really liked this mall, particularly the basement area where the grocery, food court and bakeshops are located. The food available here are all so interesting and varied, from cakes, breads, kimchi, Korean side dishes, to hot dishes that can either be eaten on site or brought home."
60,4.0,"Came here on Korea’s Memorial Day and there were many shoppers, mainly Mainland Chinese tourists. It is mainly the high end stuff, such as cosmetics and clothing they come for."
61,4.0,"This massive multi-floor department store stood across the street from my Seoul hotel, so I went over to check it out one day. It seemed to be a typical upscale store, similar to myriad others in the world, with many boutique shops and most prices on the high end. I noted many Korean-made items available. All floors looked well maintained and had nicely displayed merchandise. It was early November and the whole place was already beautifully decorated for the upcoming holiday season. I didn't interact with any employees so cannot comment on the staff and service.  The food court in the basement, however, brought me back to Lotte twice. I ate two very good dinners (Chinese and Korean) there and found the staff upbeat and pleasant. The cashier for the food court and at least one person at each order counter spoke good English. The area became crowded in the early evening, and I shared my table with a local resident on each visit. Both became lovely dinner companions as we discussed many topics, including what not to miss during my exploration of Seoul.  For those looking for good buys, I cannot recommend Lotte, based on what I saw. But there are plenty of other places nearby, such as Namdaemun Market with its estimated 10,172 stores. It offers bargains at many shops and provides a totally different experience from typical department stores"
62,3.0,It’s a nice upmarket store with some high end brands. It’s not so where to go looking for great shopping bargains. Quick visit to realize out of my price range
63,4.0,I stayed at the lotte hotel right next to this main store. I felt the prices are a bit higher than other places. It is very convenient if you don’t like leaving the hotel and things. Overall it is very nice mall.
64,2.0,I am not how to start. I needed some travelling supplies while on vacation and went to one of the boutiques in the store to buy some. When the clerk realized I only wanted travel size products her English skills suddenly evaporated. I made my way to the luggage department hoping to find something there. They didn’t but the staff led me to the department I could find it in. My thinking is the staff in the high end shop should be trained by the people who trained those in luggage.  I have shopped in other “high end” stores and my expectations are that the greater the value of the goods the more valuable the service is. I don’t expect attitude only good service. This experience has coloured my opinion of Lottie’s as a “high end “ store. My rating is based on Lottie’s being a high end store.
65,3.0,"Lotte Department Store.. THE MAIN STORE?? Yes it is big. Yes there are 3 /4 floors for duty- free( enroll first) But to me, I didn’t know the limitations till I had a look see ! Other than the duty- free section( absolutely packed with tourists) , I would not be bothered ( cf Hk’s malls,) Made in Korea is the theme... the best section is 5he ground floor FOOD.. yes, a world wide selection of imported/ local foods... impressive! For a resident Korean.. RATE... maybe. 8/10(what other choice is there?) It’s the biggest shop in the country.. the FLAGSHIP... I am a tourist, and can compare!!!"
66,5.0,"Everything that you would want to buy under one roof. Easy access to public transportation and very convenient and easy to get to. They also have supermarket with food court available, for you to have coffee after your long shopping trip. Nearby are Avenue L and Myeongdong Shopping area."
67,3.0,"The mall itself was no biggie, just like any other big brand mall in Asia. Was pleasantly surprised with their foodcourt in the basement. Reminded me of those high standard ones in Tokyo. Getting to an elevator took a lot of patience.."
68,4.0,"The place is composed OF The whole Building. IT has everything you want to buy. Above floors are for shopping whole The basement is The supermarket and Food court. After shopping, prices are reasonable, we ate at The Food court at Panda express. There are a lot OF choices for Food, desserts and confections. A good half a day to spend."
69,5.0,Staying at the Lotte Hotel Seoul gave us the easy excess to this department store as it's just a walking distance down the escalator from the hotel lobby. It is so huge and down below the department stores are the supermarket and dining area. We manage to grab our lunch here at the food section.
70,5.0,"Many things to buy. Lots of brand. Nearby Lotte Mart like a supermaeket for buying some food, snack and beverage. Also, price is cheaper than other supermarket."
71,4.0,"It was a weekday yet so very crowded! The mall is very big and has many floors. I recommend to check the directory for what each floor offers, so that you can better understand where to go. Otherwise you spend a lot of time navigating thru the crowds and floors. There are some floors dedicated for duty free shopping, which seemed the most crowded with shoppers pulling trolley bags to contain their things. Be prepared for the long queue to make payment for your shopping goods!"
72,3.0,"It is a huge shopping mall, be prepared by wearing a pair of comfortable shoe wears. We went during the weekend, despite the size it was still very crowded. I would advise do some reading and know at least a little of the mall map, or else you'll have to spend more of being lost."
73,5.0,"This one of the main department stores in Seoul. It is comprehensive in that it has a large food court, clothing, beauty, travel and many other features. It was an easy walk here from my hotel Prince hotel. Directly across the street is a large street market area in Myeongdong. A great store to shop in. It gives you a cultural understanding of Seoul."
74,5.0,It’s a very big shopping mall with also small booths around Many restaurants of different food types starting from fast food to fresh Korean food and also the stores have quiet good sales and reasonably good price and also cinema  Nice Manal Oman
75,3.0,not the top mall in Seoul but you can find everything in 1 place from food to clothes. the surrounding area is great.
76,4.0,"A large department store filled with tourists, we were here on a weekday And it is jam packed. Lots and lots of brand names and luxury goods items. We were a little disappointed that they didn't carry more Korean local designers . But there are a few floors dedicated to duty free shopping. So spend away !"
77,4.0,"A large department store along the lines of its Japanese counterparts with lots of eager Chinese tourists in the luxury goods ( particularly cosmetics dept- well actually in much smaller numbers already due to recent strained ties between the two countries). Lots of brand name goods, but if you are looking for more diverse fares there are lots of other options in Seoul"
78,4.0,"Every morning, there is a long line of Chinese tourists forming outside the building and they’re only let it when the department store opens. The tax free floors are between 9-12 while the rest of the building stays closed till their opening time of 1030am  There’s a LINE shop somewhere between floors 9&10 and though it’s not a full fledged shop. They sell most of the popular items like stationary or plushies. They sell in both USD and KRW. But even with the USD conversion rate to KRW, the items are still cheaper to be purchased here than the LINE friends shop! TAX FREE for the win!  Enjoy and don’t forget to check out the supermarket on B1. It’s not huge but some of their offer items are damn good! And value for money!"
79,3.0,"Just a feedback on the Food halls at Lotte Department Store at the basement. If you are looking to buy tidbits, snacks, seaweed, etc. To bring home, the choices here are rather limited and do compare prices if you are buying a lot. We bought our items here but was disappointed to find prices for the same snack elsewhere in independent marts cheaper by 10,000 won and others by a few thousand won. Sharing so you won't have the same experience. Check out before buying. Of course they may still have items cheaper just that we didn't buy those perhaps."
80,1.0,Items are highly priced. Shopkeepers are arrogant and not friendly. I feel that Koreans are arrogant in reel and real life.
81,5.0,"Amazing shopping center that seems to have anything that you wold need. It is really large so it can be quite hard to find specific items. We stopped by before heading off to get tteokbokki chips, among other things. They have empty boxes available at the checkout for carrying items. There is also tape and ribbon to pack the boxes. We essentially packed what we brought and left for the airport."
82,5.0,"We stayed at Crown Park Hotel which is across from this mall. It is huge dept store that sells duty free brand items. Global Blue tax free shopping onsite. It has many floors with clothes that are pricey. I love the food court!!! lots of choices, appealing display of cookies, pastries, cakes, street food items... etc. We eat here all the time before going back to our hotel."
83,4.0,"In Lotte Department Store you can find a lot of shops: Chanel, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Kakao friends, Line friends and more. Mostly I liked basement floor. There are many foods and drinks. You should go to Ops! and Tea Museum. W Lotte Department Store można znaleść wiele różnych sklepów np. Chanel, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Kakao Friends, Line Friends i wiele innych. Najbardziej polecam poziom -1, gdzie można znaleść jedzenie i picie. Polecam szczególnie: Ops! i Tea Museum."
84,3.0,Lotte Department store is a luxury mall with high end brands inside of it. There's some food court on the basement. We visited this place just for window shopping and seeing its nice interior.
85,3.0,"It's department store without any retailers' shop inside. I was looking for merrel shoes here, but it seems like in Korea shoes size 8 is too big for them. They said7.5 is the biggest, 8 is too difficult to sales, What!!!"
86,3.0,"First impression see the main floor with your standard beauty booths. When we arrived the top floor; we decided to leave immediately. The whole top floor was filled with Chinese tourist lined up to purchase their duty free expensive things. The rest of the floors are pretty standard with different items for each floor. Finally, we arrived the basement. There were so many different variety of foods, looking delicious and tasty - it was heaven."
87,4.0,"I bought a shirts in the Lotte Department Sore at the men's floor on Dec 31 17, i told one of the sales lady that she is the first lady i met in Seoul with smile, but she told me she is not the Korean, she is a Chinese that got the working visa after graduate from University in Seoul!  I also bought a down jacket at the DKNY counter, but there is no stock, i told the salesman that I'm leaving Seoul on the next day, the Manager Mi Kyung, Ahn told me that she will got the jacket from the warehouse and deliver the jacket to my hotel at around 21:30, and she did it as promised, good service!  To shop at Lotte World, split the voucher for each below Krw200,000.00 so that you can get the tax refund there."
88,4.0,"Nice, worth a visit. Many tourist especially from mainland China. Not all are cheap but not all are expensive. U have to know the price at other place before comparing."
89,4.0,Was in Seoul for Christmas and stayed just next door at the Lotte Hotel Seoul with direct access to Lotte department store. There are just so many varieties of food at the basement of this department store. The one that we liked most was the Korea restaurant somewhere at the end of the store. They served very good seafood SUNDUBU JJIGAE (KOREAN SPICY SOFT TOFU STEW). They have also so many good bakeries that are tempting and delicious.
90,4.0,"Large luxurious department store. Luxurious prices too!  Food halls in the basement are nice, elaborate and offer a wide selection of gourmet foods. If you're looking to have lunch, the choices are mainly Asian food. Not much in terms of diverse western cuisine. However, for Korean, Japanese, Chinese food you're well taken care of. Self service, but stalls offer a broad variety of choices.  Upstairs this is a typical department store. You can find many brands that are popular in Asia, but perhaps less so in the USA.  Restaurants on the 13th and 14th floors are Asian as well. Again mainly Korean, Chinese, Japanese."
91,5.0,Lotte department store is a hub for all of the world class brands and also the korean ones. The basement have a huge gourmet stores and a grocery store. Also it have a huge cinema theater next to it
92,5.0,"Without fail, we always make it a point to visit Lotte Department stores in every visit. Whether in Seoul or other cities ( if available). The Lotte ambience is cosy, a great place to shop here.  In particular we love their nice & huge supermarket; with its interesting, wide, excellent & beautiful range of products. And the food section here is great especially the bakeries, & eateries too.  Prices at Lotte are more affordable compared to the very upmarket Shinsegae or even Hyundai Department stores. We always buy alot nice of stuff from the supermarket here.  This store is within walking distance of Myeongdong shopping street where we stay. There is another branch just outside Seoul Main Station."
93,4.0,"Duty Free, check!Variety of food in its foodcourt, check!Grocery shopping, check! High end and millenial shopping departments, check! No wonder a lot of tourists flock to this mall for great food and shopping that caters to young and mature customers alike. There is a good Japanese resto in Avenue L that is a good discovery. Or if you just want to ease hunger pangs then it is the food court where a Japanese conveyor belt sushi can be found or traditional Korean food or Chinese and Asian delights as well, not to mention endless well loved street food snacks in the convenience of a Mall. Coffee-holics and dessert hounds? You’ll surely find the relaxing atmosphere at the basement your thing. It is a good respite from the shop-a-holics of Myeongdong."
94,3.0,"There is a food court with local food. Side dishes sold at the supermarket is quite reasonably priced but do note to be more firm with the sales assistant. They will attempt to purposely packed more for you and get you to commit to it. Loads of food varieties to choose from and it's a great place to get snacks back as gifts. When there's sale, prices here is cheaper than their market."
95,5.0,There are several Lotte department stores. This in the Myeongdong seems to be the most luxuruous one. In the same building there seem to show the global brands. Tax free Trade seems to be worthwhile because there are some floors dedicated to it.
96,4.0,Centrally located. Possible to find everything in many different shops. Especially food court in basement floor presents many tasty selections. Prices are above medium. Worth visiting.
97,4.0,"Lotte department store is one of the best shopping centre in Seoul.It Interesting and there are many products.Also,It next to Lotte hotel.There are Taxi free in (9,10,11 and firsr floor).There are many good shops .In my opinion if you have kids you should come wonderful design cloth and cool deal.Women products Paris and Milan are more cheaper for woman hand bags and shoes."
98,4.0,"Lotte department store, Lotte Young Plaza and Avenue are all interconnected so you can shop comfortably in air conditioned space. There are food halls and clean modern washrooms in all 3."
99,5.0,Really nice department store. Interesting product mix. Great visual merchandising and impressive standards.
100,2.0,"Spent few days in Seoul for Business purposes and as it was next to the hotel went there in order to check out any eventual bar gains...  Was a quite disappointing experience as it was overcrowded, people pretty aggressive and when checking out the prices couldn't find anything worthy  In my opinion spend your time somewhere else"
101,4.0,"This is definitely a good place to go if you can afford such brands: most of the brands there are more on the high end side e.g. MCM, Gucci etc. There is a bargain basement (where most people were there) and also a great food court (I hanged around there for most of the time). I am not sure if its a must go place because it is just a department store full of stores that are in fact on streets as well."
102,3.0,Just another mall in seoul. locatated in the central and close to local shopping area. free wifi is the best park. many branded products at cheap price. so worth a visit if you are in that area.
103,4.0,It's connected thru the subway underground shopping place and once you enter the door ...you will be surrounded by crowds of people and bakery booths and food booths plus some local specialty booths that range from anything you could think of to be as a gift or for self enjoyment. Too bad I was not hungry but it is a good place to have some decent food while shopping there.
104,4.0,A departmental store selling a wide range of items in the heart of Myeongdong. Clean and organised. Don't forget to bring your passport to claim tax refunds!
105,4.0,"The mall won't open until 10:30 so it's not something for those who wake up early.  The mall also have 2 floors full of duty free counters, though I think it's possible to find these products cheaper even with tax, if you have time to shop around.  Overall a nice, would come again when travel with my girlfriend."
106,5.0,"The mall has got everything from apparels to household to food and groceries. In short, this mall is for the whole family of all ages.  The highlight is the baby room on level 7, not only was it fully equipped with the necessary (changing stations, hot and cold water dispenser, etc), it provides all necessities such as wipes, diapers, creams, even a cot room for your child to catch a wink. The amenities offered were so comprehensive that any parent can just show up with a child, without bringing anything else."
107,4.0,There are many attractive shops here. I go to duty free shops whenever I come to Seoul. I saw some event in front of the store. It's so fun.
108,3.0,This place is good if you are looking for Made in Korea F&B items. Here you can find a whole battalion of China Chinese buying and grabbing everything in sight.
109,4.0,"I don't like to shop much but the Lotte department store is definitely a place to see if you are visiting Seoul. It is enormous with beautiful clean and organized facilities. There are all kinds of shopping options though it is pricey. It's also located within the complex of Lotte attractions so there are all kinds of things to do nearby (nature park on a large pond, amusement park, aquarium, etc) for those who don't wish to shop."
110,5.0,"最吸引是9/F,10/F 的duty free. 我選擇住在明洞都因為這個duty free! 拿著visa credit card 有9折, signature visa 有85折, 吸引到不得了!!!! 不過, 唯一就係早關門. 無法, 我們是瘋狂購物者, 一行就忘記時間. 放心, 我一定會再來, 等我!"
111,5.0,Similar to the Shinsegae. This store is pretty big with a lot of shopping options. Pretty good location too
112,4.0,This in my opinion one of the best department stores Asia has to offer! When you come to shop be sure to bring your passport because you can get a percentage back for duty free.
113,4.0,All items from head to toe and from all the age range can be found in this mall. And all designer things is here also. Its a one stop shop for everything.
114,4.0,What a mall! Lots here for anyone to choose from and it surely is expensive with all the high end brand name clothing. No outlet prices in this mall.
115,4.0,"I had never heard of Lotte World, Mall, Department Store, etc. before our recent visit to Korea. Upon walking inside, I was instantly reminded of Harrods in London. It is a luxury department store of that scale with a huge food court in the basement. We didn't buy anything, but it was fun to shop."
116,3.0,"Nothing much, just a department store and a supermarket within a big lotte complex. Had a good Korean meal on the top floor. Born-ga by some famous chef from Korea. Big building are seldom in Hanoi. This is way off the tourist area."
117,2.0,"It's nothing but a multi-story Department Store with many International Designer Brands and an incredible number of cosmetics counters, comparable to Saks Fifth Avenue or Henri Bendel in New York or Harvey Nichols in London. If I lived in Seoul or a tourist looking for tax-free Brand Name shopping, I would likely shop here. If you are a tourist not interested in buying brands that are not available in your home countries, save yourselves the headache and avoid fighting through the crowds. With the recent travel recommendations from one of the neighbouring countries, you may be able to enjoy walking through the Store without getting bodychecks these days.  The Poor Rating is not a reflection of the Department Store itself but simply the whole retail experience. It was extremely crowded and noisy when we visited."
118,5.0,"This is the Store of Seoul. This time, I have seen so many more pretty things from France than ever before, which more than a decade ago. The duty free shop on top floors were replaced by visitors from China rather than Japanese tourist as before. Not much of a shopper these days, in my tender age, I didn't get to see everything but food court was a necessary visit. I gave 5 star rating for it being the hub-bub of MyeongDong attraction. Things can be more pricy compared to other areas in Seoul. I am glad that the place maintained its popularity and evolved to cater the younger crowds & foreign visitors as even for choice of food in the lower floors. Somewhat crowded but this is the story of Seoul. I give credit to Koreans that tried their best to meet up to the standards of westerner or foreign visitors."
119,3.0,Lotte Department Store Main is in Namdaemun which is easy accessible on foot from Myeongdong. Mature clients are their main target.
120,4.0,"In terms of budget shopping, this isn't somewhere you would necessarily go to, but I wouldn't say the things are completely expensive. The food court + supermarket was definitely a highlight."
121,4.0,"C1 ( 2016.12.12 ) This Lotte department store brand was number 1. in Korea. I didn't like Lotte, but it was certain that there was very good department store. There was always crowded and many stores located. Especially, there was very good place to shop to foreigner , but too crowded to me."
122,3.0,"Almost everything can be found here, however its not cheap. Easily accessible, can take a look around if you have the time."
123,4.0,"Very well equipped department store but expensive. All European brands presented but at least double in prices. An exciting visit, nice Asian designs."
124,4.0,"This is a huge luxury shopping mall with a lot of high end brands - think Burberry, Coach, etc. There is a small supermarket and a food court, as well as some restaurants. Since this mall is higher end, there didn't seem to be too many sales worth going for, even on Black Friday. It's a nice place to walk around though. For younger and more trendy brands, there is the Lotte Young Plaza mall that is attached. You can browse this mall all the way to the top floor and take the walkway over to the Lotte Young Plaza from the cinema."
125,1.0,Crowded and overpriced is your first hit. Counterfeit and unhelpful staff are your next. I wouldn't recommend going.
126,4.0,"If you haven't been to large department stores in London and Tokyo, this is the one you can definitely go to experience the feeling of walking through a massive department store that not only sells clothes, but also groceries and food. This flagship department store is similar to other department stores in that it sells plenty of clothes, home kitchen supplies, and other items.  However, you really want to visit the basement of this store to see the groceries and food sections. It did seem to be a little smaller than the basement food sections of department stores you see in Tokyo (e.g. Ginza), but it is still worthwhile to visit. There are plenty of high end groceries (especially meats and seafood - and your expensive fruits and melons) at really high-end prices. There are also plenty of small restaurants and stalls selling take away food and snacks, so allow yourself some time to go through the basement...  The store is also conveniently located next to the subway line so it makes it quite easy to visit."
127,4.0,"Good ambience with all the christmas decorations. Plenty of stuffs to see. But supermarket is quite small. However, if you are looking for the top 10 snacks to buy, you can find it here"
128,4.0,"This is a big department store the way Bergdorf Goodman in New York, Harrod's in London, El Corte Ingles in Madrid, La Rinascente in Milan are. It has a lot of high street and high end luxury brands. Cosmetics on the first floor to draw customers in and clothes on the upper floors. One could spend hours in it..."
129,1.0,"So I bought a watch in this store and as I needed to obtain it in the airport, I handed my air ticket and passport for the shop assistant to arrange the pick-up time. The assistant wrongly inputted the date as 16/11 when it should have been 6/11. This mistake made me unable to obtain my item for which I had already paid, so I had to stop the transaction made via credit card immediately. What makes it even more frustrating is that the airport staff, after understanding my case, was unable to solve the problem for me. I left Korea without ever obtaining my item. Therefore, I truly found the staff irresponsible and unhelpful."
130,3.0,"This was our first family visit to Seoul with the in-laws, stayed at the Lotte Hotel World which is close to where family lives in Jamsil. As an American, I prefer my South Coast Plaza/Nordstrom/Macy's, but this was convenient to have close by. We were able to purchase a nice birthday gift duty-free for my mother-in-law's birthday celebration. However, most the items were high-end luxury items, not necessarily the brands I would shop at home. The food court and grocery store in the basement were convenient to have around, as were the Korean restaurants on the 11th floor. Don't eat at the other ethnic restaurants--the Indian, Italian, Vietnamese food taste weird and are not authentic. Stick with Korean, and the Japanese is OK.  The customer service is OK. I feel smothered because they tail you as soon as you enter an area or show interest in an area. I like having my independence and personal space.  If you are looking for more affordable shopping, go the the sections of the store bordering Lotte Mart -- there are some domestic low-cost brands there as well as a Zara. Or walk further into the new mall at the Lotte World Tower, there is a Gap, Banana Republic, etc. Or go to the basement into the subway area, there are tons of local stores and chains that sell items for $10-20."
131,4.0,"If you are looking to get some brandname goods, please visit here. Some staffs could not speak english but they are ready to help (i strongly suggest to get direction or location of particular shops from the interactive sign, as sometime they don't exactly know where it is and gives wrong info).  Lotte duty free is always busy and should visit before lunch time.  Supermarket on the basement is very busy in the evening and quite small."
132,4.0,"I have been here on all my visits to Seoul. Not only does it have Korean and luxury brands, they also have a wing called ""Young World"" where they have youth oriented fashion and designers. They even have a shop selling Line (Line Messenging app ) character goods. The only Muji store in the area is located inside Lotte as well. In the basement, they have the food emporium with restaurants and vendors selling various foodstuffs. While not the cheapest option, 1st time visitors who have never experienced a Japanese or Korean department store should check it out."
133,4.0,"Bring your passport to get duty-free benefit. The Lotte department store is usually busy with tourists. The staff were friendly and helpful despite being overrun by so many people. Overall a nice mall. The food court is busy and good eats. Prices are good too, especially with discounts and tax free if you have a foreign passport."
134,4.0,"There were a lot of fashion, watch, bags etc in the department store, prices were not cheap but lots with good quality. I managed to get some fashion that I liked, bought some stuff from the Lotte Mart, had yummy meals in a restaurant called Bowl in the department store, had a quick tax refund in the same building so I was happy.  Just remember every Lotte Department Stores has different operating hours and many close around 8pm. It's good to check if you are a late shopper."
135,3.0,"We only explored the lotte mart. If you want to buy korean supermarket things, this is the place. The market is crowded so it feels the market is small. You can also buy kimchi packs here."
136,5.0,This is a very nice shopping mall. It is huge and the selection here is outstanding.  The food court is amazing as well.
137,5.0,"The Lotte department store comprises of three different buildings with 4 slightly different styles. AvenueL, Lotte department store, Duty Free, and Young Plaza. We found Young Plaza to be the best for us. As, we consider ourselves younger. It is also a bit more affordable. Great service throughout the department store. It is quite large and lots of shopping to be done."
138,5.0,"The Lotte Department Store is a classic, great department store, the kind that is now difficult to find in the US. It is many floors of high-quality merchandise. If you miss the great department stores which were once so common in the US but are now scarce, you will be in heaven here. Prices are fairly steep, but they were having good sales when I was there. They have a small army of staff - everywhere you look there is a smiling sales clerk waiting to assist. I must say, they put the American department store to shame."
139,5.0,This is a huge store with most brands available. Often crowded on weekends. Ideal for those looking for branded and duty stuffs.
140,4.0,"This shopping mall is located at Myeongdong, very accessible by train and a popular shopping place for tourist. There are many floors in the building just like any other shopping mall and it's duty free too.  We went to the basement floor where they sell food, fresh ones and packaged ones... the whole section is big, you can really get anything you want here and the staff here are very helpful, some can even speak multiple languages. It's a good place to get food souvenirs since there are many choices and you can even sample some of them."
141,4.0,I went shopping with a collegue to buy clothes because her luggage did not arrive.  The store was huge with a wide variety of items. I was surprised at how expensive clothing was. For example a regular dress could be 300 or 400 US dollars.  The ground floor had a huge food market.
142,4.0,"It contains 3 blocks of building, linked with footbridges, suitable for different people from young shopper to luxury brands lovers.  You can find all you want here. Not too crowded except the top few floors of Duty Free Shops, with all the chinese crowded buying different cosmetic items.  Convenience location near subway station."
143,4.0,"U must visit when you go to south korea, lotte Department store selling a lot of thing, especially the lotte mart, the fruit and vegetables are fresh, the bread is attractive and delicious. It is worth to go"
144,4.0,"This huge shopping model is located in one of the shopping areas in Seoul, the Myongdong district.  It has a wide selection of stores, however it can be get quite crowded (at least in the weekends) hence if you need to use a fitting room you might have to expect to queue for a while.  Best option: get there early to do your shopping."
145,5.0,"There are more than 10 floors of shopping with the Lotte Hotel in one of the wings. The duty free shop is on the 10th Floor, Supermarket on the lower ground with food court. We took subway and exit at Euljiro 3 to get to this HUGE MALL after our visit to Nami Island"
146,5.0,"This place is awesome . Nice ,big, staff are friendly . Clean There three building there There cinema Prices reasonable Raining day still provide plastic holder for wet umbrella Love this place"
147,5.0,"My wife and I went to B1 to buy Korean seaweed, cabbage and radish kimchi and other assorted Korean groceries to bring it back to Singapore. We bought so much that we felt that we needed to put them all into a cardboard box. One lady staffing the seaweed section really went out of her way to get us not one but two boxes, sealed it up with masking tape and even made a handle so that we could carry it more easily! We tried to tip her W10,000 and she fought back!!! Lotte is clearly doing a great job with their customer service. Well done!!!"
148,5.0,"This is one of the most famous (or at least most advertised) department stores in Seoul, and hence, from the time it opens till the time it's closed, there are huge crowds all over the place. It is still possible to navigate through, but be prepared for a very busy area. Use the escalators, as the lifts are packed! There are 11 floors with top 3 of them dedicated to Duty Free shopping. That's where the ""madhouse"" begins :) - in a good way! You will be able to find any kind of cosmetics there, and the prices are good. Don't forget to bargain and ask for freebies!!! I know, it is a large department store, but you still allowed to ask for discount, gifts, and freebies - and get them! All assistants are helpful and speak ok-ish English. Have your passport (or the photo of it) and your return flight details, and have your VAT removed from your total.  If you pay by Visa you can get 5-15% of the total bill. Negotiate it - with gold visa you can get 10%, with platinum -15%.  In the main store you could find great fashion - local and international. The interns one isn't a bargain, but go for the local designers and objects - you will be pleasantly surprised both by look and by price.  There are restaurants and cafes all over the place, so if you need to rest your feet and boost your energy - there are plenty of opportunities to do so!"
149,1.0,"I bought a ELLE 양산 from Lotte department store Bucheon branch last year, and used it for several times last summer . Because of its quality problem(a screw was off), I brought back to Lotte Bucheon store to repair it. However, there is no more ELLE . The ELLE counter left Lotte Bucheon. So my purchased product became a homeless without after-service. Lotte Bucheon 's second floor cashier/customer center lady asked me to pay 15,000won to repair the parasol. I told her it was caused by its poor quality, I didn't break it. But she said that there was no free after-service for every brand's parasols & umbrellas. Very shocking. Can someone from Lotte Department Store explain it to me, or follow up with it?"
150,4.0,"Is good shopping mall with five floor for family clothes, accessories,shoos  The price its far with quality products and design"
151,5.0,"Bought some local snacks, Happy Call cooking pan cause its wayyyy cheaper than backhome! No plastic bags for free, but boxes are provided! fun shopping experience!"
152,3.0,"Massive mall with ten levels of shopping but way too crowded even during off peak hours on weekdays. There were big groups crowding around the more popular cosmetic counters like Sulwhasoo. The food court was really packed and the prices were on the high side as well. It really felt like a war zone with people just pushing around and I didn't enjoy shopping there, I'll go to other malls which are not as crowded."
153,2.0,"The place is crowded with China tourist. No toys section for children. The food section was very crowded. Could not enjoy. We went to MCM store, the shop assistants were rude. Wont be come here for 2nd time"
154,4.0,"Right next to our hotel (Lotte Hotel)- next to Euljiro(1)-Ga station. This is a huge 10 storyed mall with the top 3 floors dedicated to duty free goods. Other floors have everything that you want to buy when in Seoul, but the food and bakery section in the basement is to die for!"
155,4.0,"10th floor on ward is Duty Free! Bring your passport if you want to shop here!  At here, only need to show your passport and they will do everything in order for you to shop for duty free product.  Must visit the concierge first in advance to know all sort of promotion for all sorts of credit.  I gotten my Silver VIP Privilege Card for free due to credit card promotion. (Forgotten which bank promotion). But not all shop giving extra discount for VIP Privilege Card though. Better than nothing."
156,4.0,"Always is a ""MUST"" for me visiting the Lotte Duty free products for foreigners while visiting Korea . Is easy to walk from Dongdaemun or Myeongdong . That's few floors for foreigners to shop for branded goods , foodies and skincare that we may pay but collect at airport , we can enjoy buying as much and won't affected our baggage weight because goods will be collecting after check in baggage and security check . Some months may have super special deal for different credit cards holder. Nice."
157,2.0,Very crowded with tourist you can't even get basket to shop. It was luxurious compared to lotte mart and lotte outlet but the price were also more expensive that it was ridiculous. We went there to buy snack for gift and compared the price to lotte mart in seoul station. Our heart break each time we found how we lost so much money for the same brand of lotte snack
158,5.0,It is so convenient to buy all those famous brand over there and all the items are tax- free already. You can't leave until your pocket become empty!
159,5.0,They Have many lotte malls and shops where I live in Jakarta. It was refreshing to see them in south Korea too where they are booming. They also have lotte world here and lotte hotels! The world is going lotte mad! Pay a visit just to say you've been and experienced it!
160,3.0,"We last visited here around two years ago and this is still a typical mega mall with branded apparel, bags, cosmetics and a duty free on the upper floor. Do note that some items in the duty free are much higher than what you can get for them in other stores like Shisegae, so shop around.  We loved the food court and supermarket in the basement though, and it had almost everything imaginable from vegetables to cakes and sauces and fruits, We bought a couple of punnets of strawberries for 8000 won each and they were sweet and ripe."
161,4.0,"This review is only about the food court level at Lotte Main. It's an excellent place for eating and shopping for food items to take out, with the exception of wine and liquor (very limited selection, especially of liquor). There are several casual restaurant style places where you can order mainly noodle/rice bowls and sit down at a table to eat. And of course there are dozens of counters selling everything from sushi to pastries. There's also a more traditional grocery store area with produce, meat/poultry/fish and other items. If you go during the day it is quieter and easier to navigate, but one advantage of going within an hour or so of closing is that many of the more perishable items such as fresh-baked goods and prepared meal items with meat or fish are marked down for quick sale. We were able to get dinner for two for about 10,000 won (less than $10) and a bag full of excellent pastries all marked down by 20%. It's very crowded and bustling at that time but you can get some great bargains if you're willing to fight through the crowds."
162,4.0,"If you willing to buy a lot of stuff, you should go to the lotte duty free. Most of the brands are high end and still expensive (for the luxury bags), but if you want to get korean beauty products in low price, it's the best place even if they don't have all of the brand in it (such as odbo or clio)"
163,2.0,"Yeah, this place is super super crowded, particular at the Duty Free shops at 9th and 10th floor. It feels like you are at a fish market or something, except that you are shopping for luxury brands and cosmetics. And don't be surprised, most people there are Chinese and even the staffs speak Chinese. They seem to have special promotion for foreigners from China."
164,2.0,"THE GOOD  This mall have the american brand and branded ones. If you want to buy the expensive brand this is the right place for you. YOu can have your Tax refund here.  THE TO IMPROVE  This mall is very complicated when you are transferring to another, you can get lost. It close very early. it close 8pm. hoping they extend it."
165,4.0,"Lots of expensive brands names here and some duty free shopping. The B1 food hall and supermarket was the standout, has one of the best sushi trains I have eaten at in a long time."
166,5.0,I would recommend start the visit at main building from Bottom food court and super market for best experience.
167,4.0,"Really a paradise, especially the duty free with special amazing prices. I wish they have more brands and clothes at duty free. But it is too crowded and payment is separated at each store so it takes a lot of time in queue waiting to check out at each store."
168,5.0,"Despite being pre-warned by my friend to either go early or before closing time, I was totally shocked with the people flow in the duty free section of the department store located at 10-11 floor. This is particularly true to the cosmetic and/or skin care section, Here, they needed to register your passports or foreign ID for tax free price. You can take the purchased items right away under Korean brands, otherwise, you need to pick up the goods at the airport for foreign brands. This duty free section will be opened for business 1 hour earlier than regular business hour - there is a special entrance at the back (near car park) to go up."
169,5.0,"I've been to Lotte dep store last year and this November when visiting Seoul. The dep store has everything, if you're looking for one place to do your shopping- this is the place.  When visiting in the end of November the department store had beautiful christmas decorations- it's worth seeing.  Positives  #great selection of brands and mercendies, helpfull and serviceminded staff. #lottemart on basement level where youbcan buy all kinds of korean tea, snacks, cakes to bring home #dutyfree on floor 9-11 with great selection, if you're from Skandinavia or countries with heavy import taxes, you can save on your purshases #excellent foodhall with very reasonable prices and amazing selection of high quality food, #subway connetion to the nr.2 line  Negatives # if you're impationt in crowds, you might want to avoid afternoon and weekends. #this is not the place to go for cheap shopping #may not be abel to save that much on US brands in the dutyfree if you're living in the US"
170,4.0,"In the heart of the Myeongdong district, shoppers will find the Lotte Department Store. This is the flagship for the Korean based chain and it is huge, providing many hours worth of retail shopping opportunities for those who haven't had enough from shopping the streets of Myeongdong.  Lotte reminds me of the SOGO (Japanese) Department store that we have in Hong Kong. There is a bit of everything that department store shoppers might need; jewellery, clothing, handbags, shoes, accessories, make-up, electronics and a wide range of other goods.  There is also a good lower level food court and supermarket at Lotte Department Store. The supermarket is enjoyable to browse even as a tourist. It is nice seeing the quality of foods available here.  Overall, not sure if this is the best department store available in Seoul but you can certainly do a lot worse. Lotte Department Store is directly accessible from the Euljiro Station for those interested."
171,4.0,"If you come here for the regular dept store vs duty free (on floors 9-11), be prepared for large crowds and line ups at check out All the mandarin speaking customers flock here and go crazy buying. It's enough to drive yourself crazy. I hate crowds and don't recommend coming here if you are claustrophobic. The day I went, you got 5-10 percent off for using your Visa card. That was a bonus. Much better discount than the Dongwha duty free Some things are cheaper here, and some are not"
172,5.0,"Incredibly large store with every designer offered. LOVED the food court for a quick bite, as I stayed at the Lotte Hotel."
173,4.0,Just following my wife around the mall for hours. Lots of nice wares. Lots of good restaurants and excellent food court. But a mall is a mall for me. I did get fed and watered so - all in all - no complaints.
174,4.0,This is not for the faint of heart. The size is amazing and you'll find lots of HIGH END merchandise here. It's in the heart of Seoul in Myongong. 7 levels of shopping in the main store and multiple side areas. But the prices are very high end. TIP: you can get here very easily by subway.
175,5.0,"My first visit to lotte mall is at the olympic park area including lotte theme park, and the second one is lotte mall at Myongdong Area. The Mall is huge really huge with a lot of visitor. They area in the main location of Myongdong shopping area, including lotte hotel and korea star walk at the lower lever near hotel lobby. The mall is completely with many shop and restaurant, since we eat at myongdong area so we don't eat inside the mall. But I think you must try. Interesting."
176,2.0,"I didnt like it and i didnt waste my time in that place not because it was not good, but because the prices in my country are cheaper than the prices here. It is well organized and has lots of choices"
177,3.0,"The Lotte Department Store main branch is prominently located in the hotspot and busy shopping district of Myeongdong. It is the largest department store in Korea offering high-end shopping to Koreans as well as visitors. It is directly connected to Lotte Hotel Seoul and is 5 minutes by foot from my Hotel, The Westin Chosen Seoul.  You will find in the building a a wide variety of goods from reasonably priced Korean labels to world-famous luxury brands and also a duty-free shop. The food court located on lower level is huge. Lot of restaurants and food brands.  The store is opened every day from 10.30am to 8pm."
178,4.0,"We only stayed in the capital for 4 days, and this was the nicest mall we were able to visit. Not big enough for me, but maybe I am just used to the large malls we have in Manila. Was able to eat a salad at the food court. Supermarket was disappointing though. Not enough seaweed in my opinion."
179,4.0,"We were a bit let down by shopping opportunities in Seoul, we thought it would be more like Tokyo and it isn't, so when we found Myengdong area and it's shopping opportunities we were happier :) Lotte department store was mostly out of our budget as it sells mainly higher end cosmetics and clothes, bags and other goods but if you are looking for higher end goods this is your place to go. The Shu Uemura section here is quite large as well and the staff was very helpful in getting us what we were looking for plus gave us a large pile of samples for free as well. Otherwise I'd suggest the neighbourhood around the department store- good quality, but cheaper cosmetic and clothing stores (even the western ones) and lots of cafes, restaurants and food stalls. The department store has a nice toilet though hahah :)"
180,2.0,We were disappointed with the selection of stores. We got the impression that Seoul would emphasise it's fashion outlets but there was little in the way of decent clothing. The entire mall contained sportswear shops and restaurants. Though there is an aquarium and cinema.
181,4.0,"The Lotte Duty free is great for me because many of the luxury items that I love are not popular with Chinese tourists or Koreans. This means that luxury items that might be full price in New York are being offered at a discount in Korea.  I've purchased designer frames, bags, watches, skincare, etc. All great deals and so convenient to retrieve before your flight. You can take the Korean brands home with you on the day of purchase.  It's worth the trip...Don't go on the weekends unless you are wearing mental armor."
182,4.0,"All major cosmetic, luxury goods and electronics are sold here at the Duty Free Mall. You can even shop online and have the goods delivery to airport for pick up, skipping the hassle of queuing! On the basement lvl is the grocery mart and food court. Worth your time to explore and try the food, kimchi and desserts. You will not regret this!"
183,3.0,"This department store is for the SERIOUS shoppers, especially the duty free floors with all the branded goods! Very overwhelming in some areas but if you're keen to shop, then head straight here. Also the Lotte Young Plaza is really cool too for people aged from Tweens to mid 20's"
184,4.0,"The mall is crowded with tourist from China, especially the duty free floors. I love the brands. A power house of all brands. Korean brands are expensive but with great quality. Toilets are clean and very accessible. The food court is overwhelming with choices and my teens are very happy to find Rocky Mountain apple candies. I only have problems with some sales assistant because they don't speak good English but they are very friendly."
185,4.0,There is certainly a lot on offer here. the best part for me was the food court in the basement. Worth a look.
186,4.0,"I'm American, and I frequent places like 5th Ave in NYC, Michigan Ave in Chicago, and Rodeo Drive - luxury, right?  No.  Lotte mall is ridiculous. How you have all the luxury brands all on top of each other in one building is insane. Who buys all this stuff? Apparently, lots of people do, bc the place is packed with buyers, not just shoppers!  If you are a foreigner, go upstairs to the duty free floors, where the best deals are. The supermarket downstairs is cool to check out, and it's also the best place to get something to eat, like at the noodle bars. Don't eat on the higher floors - it's overpriced and underwhelming.  There are also 2 related malls next door with more designer goods, and the other one caters to the younger set.  If you're American, realize that English isn't a standard out there, so you'll have some difficulty."
187,5.0,"I will put it very simple. Go to the duty free floors, bring your passport and flight details and start to shop masks and cosmetic at excellent a prices. You will find any brand with unbeatable offers and sales. Be careful with the Chinese crowds cause they buy buy and buy more than anyone else :)"
188,2.0,"Make no mistake, the Lotte Dept. Store in Central Seoul near Euljiro 1-ga offers world-class merchandise. You will be completely overwhelmed by the breadth and quality of what you can buy at Lotte, whether it may be high fashion, food, or practically anything else.  That said, the shopping experience leaves a lot to be desired. For example, half of the B1 level is an amazing food store, with Korean groceries, international delicacies, prepared food to take home or to eat on premise. But the floor itself is not optimally laid out, there are too many people and the ceilings are extremely low. I am also not a fan of the faux Baroque architecture typically found in Lotte stores.  Once you experience B1, try to get to the Duty Free floors (9th-11th), which is likely the main reason to visit Lotte. First of all, I challenge you to find an elevator, let alone one you will be able to fit into. Once you get to the floors you will be completely overwhelmed by tourists! Times Square at Christmas is a cakewalk compared to this. My wife, who loves to shop and grew up in Seoul, swears she will never visit the Lotte Duty Free area again.  The other issue with Lotte is the relative lack of subway access. You can directly access the subway #2 line at Euljiro 1-ga but this is the loop line. You will likely need to transfer or walk to a better Metro station. Even if you are staying north of the Han River (Kang-buk) you are better off visiting the Shinsegae branch at the Express Bus Terminal south of the river in Kangnam. It's less crowded and the overall experience is better. There is no Duty Free floor but that's a plus in my book. I recommend staying away especially if you have kids with you."
189,1.0,"Great and stylish and huge department store! However when trying to pay with MasterCard , my understanding was (told by a salesgirl with lousy English skills) that MasterCard is not accepted in Lotte. Then another girl on interpreter desk ( yes that was really the name...) told that MasterCard is not accepted in while Korea. That i already knew to be rubbish and told her that i had been uusina the sane card several times in stores much smaller and less fancy. Because of the poor English skills of the personnel they lost a customer and trust in their expertise- and I still dont know why my card wasnt accepted. Would like to send them feedback but apparently their customer care does not have any email address or another channel either - loading an apps should not be the only option..."
190,3.0,This place offers a great variety of luxury goods. All clothing brands can be found here. They have a great food court and you can spend a whole day shopping here.
191,4.0,"This is a great place to shop but it's not cheap. My favorite place was their basement which had different types of food. If you're looking for quality name brand clothes, they have a large selection."
192,4.0,"Cosmetic on top floor - some how the price is lower than shops in Myendong street. Sometimes, can get additional 10% off during sales or credit card promotion like using Visa card. Love the supermarket on the Basement floor. All the instant noodles, pork meat in can and Korean products can be found here."
193,4.0,"If you think whatever to buy, in this department store there is it! Fantastic to find everything you want! Absoluted recommended! Sometimes the prices are not very cheap."
194,4.0,"Lotte department store has many brands for men, women, kids, sports, casual, house needs, cosmetics, and many others, it took over 2 hours of walking just to explore the place and do very little shopping, it is very busy and crowded. Once you are there I would recommend that you take a nice break for coffee or tea in the middle of your shopping time."
195,3.0,"I have to say that the entire Lotte World is not well designed. Maybe because I am a foreigner, I am used to things being designed for the masses, where everything that can go wrong, will go wrong, so you try to make things idiot proof for the first time visitor. Like, this whole complex, the department store, the amusement park, etc, are all integrated into downtown Seoul. Not the city center, but a side city, Songpa-gu. In other words, Lotte World is the majority of Songpa-gu. That being said, it is hard to figure out where Lotte World begins, and where it ends. There is no guidance on where to go. It is just there. Park somewhere, figure it out. No shuttles, no monorails, no people to tell you where to go. Just start walking and figure it out. But this is true of all of South Korea. All of the signs inside, like where to find the bathroom or this or that, only get you half way there. Seriously, you will follow a sign, and then there is no sign, and the thing you are looking for is nowhere to be found. It is the most frustrating thing I have encountered. It is almost like they said, we'll do you a favor, but not really. And that could not be worse in a city where the temperature and the humidity both hover around 90. You will need a shower before you find a drink of water.  Sticking to topic, the department store: So, the front entrance is kind of there where the hotel entrance is, and I see people getting off of buses, I guess for the amusement park. But where do I go? I just want to buy this damn toy helicopter that my girlfriend's kid who keeps asking for it over and over and over. So, inside, am I near the department store? Hell if I know. Finally, after wandering around, I find a long hallway that leads to some stores, and hey, there is a toys r us. I found the helicopter, but only after my friends bus had left. Different cultures, I guess."
196,3.0,"For duty free items, just proceed to level 9 , 10, 11. Be prepared to have your passport, flight details with you as items are send to the airport to be collected after you cleared customs. for the rest of the levels, shopping is as usual."
197,4.0,"Overall is good. Nice decoration and staff are also helpful. Only one thing that 'nightmare' for me is duty free because of too many Chinese tourists. I didn't mean to be racist but it's too chaos to be on a ""high-end"" department store."
198,1.0,"i bought a pair of ray ban sunglasses from the lotte department store in myeongdong. i assumed it was in perfect condition since it was a brand new pair and was KRW 240000 (and you'd assume for it to be of a certain quality). i started using it only a few days after it was purchased. that was when i noticed a manufacturing defect on the frame. there was a bubble under the frame coating which can only be attributed to a fault in the manufacturing process.  i brought it back for an exchange but it was stoically refused because any returns have to be done within a 2 hour time frame, even for products with manufacturing defects. needless to say i was pissed out of my mind and will never be purchasing anything from lotte department store again.  when i enquired about the warranty, they said i had to take it to the local dealership myself. no further information was given except it would take 20 days for the local dealership to decide on whether any rectification will be made. by which time i would've long left korea.  there is no customer service centre at lotte department store and when you have an after purchase problem with what you bought, all the previously eager beaver sales persons will shun you like the plague.  apart from the 2 hour storewide return policy, the salesperson also examined then pointed out very tiny, superficial marks on the frame (which i'd made accidentally) to further justify the need to adhere to the 2 hour return policy. seriously?! how would it matter unless the lotte staff were going to take the defective pair and resell it to the next unsuspecting tourist.  all the time during our conversation, she frequently asked for the sunglasses after which she'd try to scratch out the defect with her fingernails although i repeatedly asked her to stop it. she even tried to make off with it to somewhere else in the building to file the uneven frame coating down. like it's even possible and won't further damage the frame?!  almost everywhere in lotte, you will have the same lousy customer service. before you congratulate yourself on the marginal savings (if any) you've made by purchasing it there, think of all the unpleasantness you'll have to deal with if you find out a few days later that the product is defective. while tourist dollars are welcomed, all else (e.g. feedback, exchanges and returns) are not, even where the product was originally defective.  most purchases over KRW 30,000 are eligible for a tax refund but for all the saccharine sweetness of lotte salespersons (e.g. accompanying you to the cashier for their commission), not a single one will offer to print the tax refund form out for you even though you're obviously a tourist unless you specifically request for it with much difficulty in english. (the tax refund form has to be provided by the store in which you've made your purchases.)  try it if you don't believe me! for all it's worth, i'll rather pay a few dollars more and get it anywhere but in lotte! 1st world department store run by scam artists.  p.s.: my sunglasses are a lot worse for wear after the sales person's scrubbing and recounting my experience makes my blood boil."
199,5.0,"Lotte department full of varies food , I relly like there cookies , example: lotte chocolate pie and mints."
200,4.0,I have been to Myeongdong when I saw this department store It is very cheap than TAIWAN SHOOPING there is very happy
201,4.0,.....but I had to be impressed with this shopping centre. Something like 10 floors of everything from designer label to basement bargain sellout tables. From duty free to great food. Even has a fresh food market in the basement that has some of the most delicious delicacies around. Still hate shopping but enjoyed the experience
202,3.0,"Yes, it is huge. Yes, it is in the middle of the city centre. And yes, there's lots of choice. But no, Lotte Department Store is not unique. Even in Seoul itself larger department stores can be found. For example, ""i-Park"" at Yongsan Station is much bigger and has a more diverse assortment.  If you're in the neighbourhood do visit the Lotte Department store by any means. Choice is vast and the base floor with a food court is highly recommendable. But this store isn't worth traveling for."
203,3.0,"This departmental store is located in the same complex as Lotte Hotel, and has everything that you would expect of a mega store, from branded clothes to electronics, and also includes the Lotte duty free shop as well. There are multiple restaurant options on the higher floors. But we prefer the Premium foodcourt that is located in the basement, which is clean, brightly lit and has choices ranging from Japanese food to bulgogi etc. There is also a well stocked supermarket, where the fruits especially are very fresh. You should also check out the small bakery near the foodcourt that sells very delicious fried mungbean fritters filled with red bean."
204,4.0,"It's truly a shoppers paradise. 14 floors of shopping. All the best brands in cosmetics, jewellery, clothes and some electronics, all under one roof. Basement two floors has food court and groceries. It has a excellent duty free shop in the 9th to 11th floor. It's flooded with Chinese and other foreigners. Shop and order things, you can collect at the Lotte window at the Incheon airport, while flying back. Also on the 12th floor, have lot of restaurants serving Thai, Chinese and Italian food. It also has a cultural center in the 14th floor. Duty free shopping is worth visiting, get good deals, especially on cosmetics and watches. Need at least 4-5 hours of shopping time to browse and choose. Worth visiting."
205,4.0,"Lotte Departmental Store at Myeongdong is a must visit for any shoppers to Seoul. It sells everything and caters to foreign visitors with large selection of duty-free merchandises. Not surprisingly, the store is filled with tourist shoppers. Interestingly, if you purchase any duty-free goods at Lotte Departmental Store, the goods can only be collected at Incheon International Airport when you leave South Korea. If you are looking to buy something, Lotte Departmental Store Myeongdong is your best bet."
206,4.0,The Duty Free Shops from 9F to 11F. So many people（mainly Chinese Travel Groups) in 9F(Cosmetic products). 10F & 11F for luxury brands. Most of staff can speak some Chinese. Customer place the orders there and pick up the products via the windows of LOTTE at the airports (Incheon & Gimpo) before they depart. They don't need to carry the shopping bags to next place. This is a very smart sales model in Asia and accepted by most of people. Also there is a supermarket/food mart on basement besides food court area.
207,4.0,Spent hours just in the basement and looking at the foods. Definitely need to allocate more hours if you plan to look around till you are content.
208,4.0,"Its just beside my hotel- Lotte Hotel Seoul. All branded brands of clothing, jewelries, watches, bags, make up and perfumes are all in the store... It's really a heaven place for girls."
209,4.0,"well, beside floor 9-11th on free tax store, which I dont really interested in . Beside, too many tourist crowded floor and the customer services are not that polite compare to other stores / floor. You should however, pay a visit to their basement on the food court area. Very interesting place to look at."
210,5.0,"Go to the Duty Free Store if you are a foreigner. Prices are much cheaper there. You do not need to worry if you are buying international brands since the collection area is at the airport. However, if you are buying Korean brand stuffs, you can carry your items on the spot. There are 11 or 12 levels altogether. Enjoy your shopping there."
211,4.0,"all things mostly very expensive, more expensive if you compared from my city (Jakarta), but i fall in love with the food court down on the bottom floor. lots of food vierity there, asian and western all are availble. price might be costly but if you feel the taste and quantity its worth, i been eating here for 2 times, and always i need to share my food, you can say, 1 portion sufficent for 2. taste also amazing, so fit with my taste. love the food court heaps :)"
212,4.0,"I don't usually rate department stores because I'm not a big shopper. I did enjoy walking around this one though and having a meal on the bottom floor. Like other reviews mentioned, it's a lot of the same brands you'd find in a large western mall. Nice to look at, but not so nice to buy... well at least not on my budget.  I do agree that the food court was nice. It's a little more expensive than some other meals, but really not that expensive for the quality. It's not all Korea food, but rather just various Asian cuisines. I sat down and had some soba noodles which reminded me of my previous stays in Japan.  The 1st floor is mostly named brand makeup that doesn't have much to do with Korea and the following floors up until the 8th floor follow suit with other brand name products. Things change once you hit the 9th floor though. That floor is special in that it's duty free shopping. I guess it's the same kind of discount you'd get at the airport duty free, but I didn't check. You'll need a passport, flight ticket or at least to know your flight number to make a purchase.  The duty free area of this shopping mall has turned into a must for Chinese tourists. Mostly because it's part of just about, if not every, Chinese guided tour group. During peak hours it'll be crammed pack and basically shoulder to shoulder. Given the target audience most of the employees on this floor can also speak Chinese fluently, but their English might be just a few phrases.  It's right across the street from the Myeongdong outside shopping area, so it's a place you can stroll through quickly without going out of the way. Then you can cross it off your list, maybe pick up a few small duty free items and have a quick bite to eat in the food court."
213,5.0,"If you ever been to Harrods, or KDW in Berlin, etc. Lotte is a great example of one stop shopping with top notch luxury to boot. What makes Lotte even more incredible is the food hall in the basement level. I recommend coming here first, before you go and book any restaurants in Seoul. It's amazing and a foodie dream"
214,5.0,"I have noticed that the food court at Lotte department store in Myeongdong has had a few mentions here. Well, you do have to experience it to know why. Almost the entire basement of this high class department store has been dedicated to food. There is a grocery section, stall after stall of kimchi sellers, a branch of Fauchon from Paris, and then there is the hot food section. Heaven...! For those of you, including, myself, who salivates over street food but can't quite work up the guts to indulge, the Lotte food court will satisfy your cravings. Our favourite were the deep fried fish cake sausages (I am sure the Korean name for these are much more romantic...), with variations including a sesame leaf or seaweed wrap. These were simply delicious. Table real estate is scarce for the number of people wanting to eat, but we always ended up with a table, and we aren't very aggressive about this. There are also non-street food options, such as sushi, fish, noodle, and rice bars. You will eventually want to explore other food options, but if you are in the area this is a definite must see (and eat!!!)."
215,4.0,"This is your regular department store with all the American brands. What we liked most was the Food Court. A must go for at least one meal. You can buy your food from anyone of the take out shops and eat in their lounge. That means, if you are traveling with people that have different tastes, everyone will be happy. During the weekday, we found they open at 10:00 a.m., the I went on a Saturday and they didn't open until 10:30 a.m. You can take the Line 2 Blue to Euljiro1, exit 8."
216,5.0,"I like to visit food courts,all over the world in department stores.I think that they offer great opportunities to discover food cultures.Lotte Food departmant was amazing.We took tasty foods from food section.There was a comfortable sitting area inside.I mostly like baked korean sweet patatoes.It is worth a visit for a lunch."
217,2.0,"I purchased a purse from the lotte duty free store had to wait till I got to the airport to pick up my purchase. Let's just say the boxed item they showed me at the store, the purse was in great form! The tissue was wrapped around the zipper pull, the protective bag was in the box. By the time I picked up the purchase at the airport, it was not the same exact purse the lady showed me. I remember details. The protective bag was missing and the purse didn't look as new as the one I was presented with at the store. So somewhere between the time I purchased the purse someone swapped out my purchase and taken out the simple protective bag? I will never buy from them again as I do think trust them. I emailed the specialty stores to make my complaint. A purse is not complete with missing parts!"
218,4.0,"Big and multileveled shopping mall with top designer brands such as rolex, louis vutton, prada and many more.  Be sure to grab a map when entering as this complex is not only big but also crowded with mainly china tourist.  Staff customer service is sometimes bad depending who serves you as well as how busy they are. Most of the staff can communicate in mandarins. Their English however is weak.  Do bring passport for prove entitlement of duty free. Platinum visa card holders are automatically given 15% discount on certain item."
219,3.0,good place to buy cosmetics or skincare without going onto the streets of myeongdong and escape the cold...but there are limited products that you can buy from each brand so i would still recommend you to take a stroll down myeongdong streets (Opposite Lotte young plaza)
220,4.0,"Anything you want, from the budget items to the highest level (they even had a section of Gucci for Kids), with a large variety of everything...  It was especially crowded on the sale floor, so best avoid that unless you really want something from there.  Good variety of gadgets and sunglasses despite this being a non-speciality store."
221,5.0,"This is a luxury department store in the center of Seoul downtown, but what we found to be most impressive and very special is the food court in the basement of the department store. You do not want to miss this experience! It was one of our best dining experiences in Seoul."
222,4.0,"sometimes, i prefer to go out to myeongdong and see the stuff they have to offer. I bought Sulwhasoo, moisturizer, that is only available in the big malls. My korean friend recommended it and i found very good reviews online."
223,4.0,"As it was just opposite our hotel, we were very lucky. We were delighted as there were many levels of international and korean designers. We find the korean design very nice.  As they were selling Winter wear rather than summer outfit, we do not find them suitable for our weather.  We chance upon a Oilily Store which was our favorite a sit is the most colourful store. It si on the third level if I recall. or you could check out at teh information. We bought 2 bags. there were clothings, bags, etc. Certain items were 30% to 40% off so it was a great buy.  We wish we had more time so we can shop more here.  Prices for some items like international brands may be steeper. As wejust ahd our Singapore Sale, we find the prices better in Singapore.  Also, better to get brands that we cannot find in Singapore.  We love this department store."
224,2.0,Was there on my last day to buy some side dishes back to Singapore .Alot of small counter sell the same things but all price are written in korean.We askhow much is the side dishes and ALL the aunties point to the most expensive price tag stated above the food .They let you try them but if you do not buy from them they will scold you in korean.You can even bargain for the price you wanted and those aunties claim they are giving you a discount. I will nver go there again...feel that I have been rip-off.
225,5.0,"Lotte dept store, lotte young store, and the surrounding neighborhood felt like Seoul does Tokyo. Best place for shopping in the city, and great people watching at night time."
226,2.0,"We were quite surprised with the range of goods on offer, everything is overpriced, and it was overcrowded not a nice shopping experience at all. It was a nice looking department store, but if you have the opportunity to shop elsewhere on holidays like Europe, UK, Australia, then wait till then for better shopping choices and prices."
227,4.0,"Lotte is a household name in Korea, like Hyundai and Samsung, etc. This is a huge departmental store with nearly everything under the sun, intergrated cinema, entertainment centre, restaurants, etc.  Good: Clean and modern. If you love malls then this is for you. Convenient to get to, directly underground connection to subway. All the major brands can be found here. Translators (for English/Mandarin/Jap) may be found on each floor (they wear a sash stating their language ability).  Hmmm: Many staff do not speak English (hence the translators). There are a few other interesting themed malls nearby. Or cross the road to the main Myeongdong shopping streets (I prefer these!)."
228,4.0,"The basement food hall is reminiscent of the ones found in Japanese department stores. Amazing variety, beautifully displayed. And there's a food court with great affordable food."
229,5.0,"My husband and I always like to see how does the departmental store in other countries. Not much different from Malaysia, lively supermarket during the weekend, and the best part is, you MUST get the Korean instant noodles to bring back as some of the brands were not found in Malaysia. ;)"
