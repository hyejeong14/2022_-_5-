27,5.0,"Gyeongdong Market is famous for its fruit sellers and low prices. The fruit zone is really huge and lively. You can find various kinds of Korean fruits and imported fruits. However, be careful. There are dishonest sellers giving lower quality fruits than samples. So, you should check before paying especially purchasing as a box. Also, there are many others like ginsengs, vegetables, grains, seafoods, etc."
28,4.0,"This was a great place to drop by at - and my friends and I could search through piles of ginseng etc,.. and amuse ourselves constantly with our serendipitous finds!"
29,4.0,"We wandered down this street not knowing in advance what it was. Absolutely fascinating! Not until later were we informed this is the largest herbal medicine market in Korea. Had no idea of most of what we were looking at, but it really didn't matter. It is a traditional Korean market, and that's what mattered. We also found fruits here as well as medicinal herbs. And volcanic rock from Jeju Island."
30,5.0,"Very huge ginseng market where you can smell the ginseng odor once you come out from metro. Some owners speak chinese but mostly cannot understand english. I bought many ginseng, cheap and expensive ones and when cook you can notice the flavour straight away. Further down, fruits section where you can find many kinds of local fruits."
31,4.0,"We went to Gyeongdong Yaknyeong Market looking for ginseng, and ginseng is what we found and much more. Ginseng came in different varieties from fresh sitting in baskets on the ground to dried in vacuum packed and boxed or the more expensive varieties in tins. It was considerably cheaper than in stores.  But the market also offers so much more including dried fish, squid, seaweed, as well as vegetables and fruit, all at very reasonable prices. The market itself was extremely clean and well organised, well worth a visit."
32,4.0,"This is a huge traditional market for truly local people's sake. It'll be a good time to experience a Korea's market.  - The location is a walkable distance from Cheongnyangni or Jegidong.  - I recommend buying fruits here. Fruits are comparatively expensive Korea. But, here is cheaper than many other places.  - There are also other fine products. Take a look first and pick the best one after."
33,3.0,"Went for the novelty of it, realized every store was selling more or less the same stuff. And every shop we walked past, the owner will come and badger us into making purchases.  We ignored most of them until we came to one where the owner didn't harrass us. Bought ginseng and ginseng tea for quite reasonable prices  However, as we left the other store owners were like staring and judging us so we decided to make a quick getaway."
34,5.0,"I came here via the subway to Jegi-dong station. As you walk tap out of the gantry area, you will be mesmerized by all the different herbal medicine displayed in the station as you access Korea's traditional herbal market. It was a truly local experience there, with very affordable herbs and groceries you can find. Most of the people you see there are ahjummas (aunties), and I could barely see any young people my age. There weren't a lot of tourists around that area, and certainly the cultural experience is very much enriching. There was a really kind ahjumma I met along the way, she was actually selling some grains such as barley and buckwheat, her stall was located near to the exit of Jeji-dong station. I was conversing with her in Korean, I actually wanted to buy some grains from her but she refused to accept my money since I was a student (that feeling of 'paiseh' is real). I managed to buy some very cheap fresh ginseng there for about 12,000 krw for 300g. The place do sell groceries as well, with berries like aronia, blackberries, and blueberries in very huge boxes. At the same time, you could enjoy lunch there as well with food like cold buckwheat noodles and sikhye rice drink for a true local experience."
35,5.0,"Overall it was a 5-star shopping experience for my family. The market was not too far from Jegi-dong subway station and selling variety kinds of herbs, from dried ones to fresh ones. We loved the ginseng zone especially. We also bought fresh strawberry, chestnut and dried persimmon which was delicious and cheap! Another good thing about it: we could bargained to get some better price, and there was not too many tourists there! Awesome!"
36,5.0,This was amazing place to visit so much to see. One of my favorites was the mushrooms there were so many varities.
37,5.0,We went of course for the fresh ginseng but this place has so much more on offer. We spent a very enjoyable couple of hours trying to guess what some things are as well as picking up other things we did not know we wanted.
38,4.0,"to me well worth a look but definitely not the normal Lonely Planet type World Heritage attraction. it's probably one of the best places to buy fresh ginseng on the planet, and perfect for any number of other herbs. the problem for the average person might be knowing what any of it is. it's also not so clearly identified, so hard to be sure when you are actually in the market and when you aren't, more an area, although there is a covered part that seems central. if there was some way you could visit with a Korean who is an expert on use of medicinal herbs you could probably get started on a life-changing supplement phase, but for many people it could just be interesting and confusing. I loved it though. local markets usually smell terrible (dead fish and such on tables will do that) but this was like being inside a bag of potpurri, just better, because it's all real herbs, not chemicals."
39,5.0,"Was staying just across the road at the K City hotel and thought I'd go for a morning stroll, which ended up being a 2 hour adventure when I discovered this market.  I loved it here- lots of fruit ginseng, meats, locals and plenty of photo opportunities.  Well worth a trip."
40,4.0,"The market is long about 1km. Many stores selling ginseng and foods. You can see people selling strawberries, promengrates, blueberries, oranges, apples, chestnuts. You have to see which stores offer good value food. Prices might varies along the way.  Ginseng price varies too. We purchased from the store which is deep inside the market. The young guy seems honest, he explained to us which was suitable to make chicken soup. He also told us to choose the short and pump ones, with lots of roots to make good chicken soup. Because more roots meaning that the ginseng has absorbed lots of nutritients.  He put those good ones inside the store. Hence, we have purchased them thinking it was the best. The price was 300g for 20,000 krw. We brought 1.5kg of 20,000 krw. The weight was 620 and 915. Hence, he gave us extra for the weight. If the taste was good, we would buy again. The ginseng smell was super strong and good. More mud at the ginseng means that they have just taken it out from the ground."
41,2.0,"We took a stroll at the market and there certainly a lot of ginseng. The fruits and vegetables look wonderful. Unfortunately we took a wrong turn and ended up on a street that had live animals a few of the cages had Dogs, which made me want to vomit. It ruined my day."
42,4.0,"I came here with my mum to purchase some fresh ginseng, there is plenty of choice. Remember to walk in deeper into the market for better bargains! We purchased 300g for 15,000KRW. It made a delicious ginseng chicken soup when we took it home! The vendors mostly do not speak any English but we found some that could speak chinese! We were told that the shorter stouter ginseng is good for soup and the taller thinner ones are best for making tea or drinks."
43,5.0,"Take Subway Line 1 to Jegi Station Exit 2. The arch for Traditional Medicine Market (药令市场） is on the left, do not turn left here as it will lead you to some stores selling dried Ginseng and other medicine. Walk straight, cross the street and turn left followed by right turn. You will reach a local market selling lots of raw Ginseng and other produce. During our visit in Oct 12, 300 grams of 6 years old raw Ginseng is selling around 10K to 13K won. Average about S$3.50 to $4.00 per piece. We visited here on our last day in Seoul so that we can bring it back as fresh as possible."
44,3.0,"Thank you for this tripadvisor guide, we managed to come here. We came here by metro line 1. We found out lots of herbs to buy. Worth to go, but really need to go deeper so can bargain with good price. At first we didnt know that, the more we get inner part, the cheaper price we get."
