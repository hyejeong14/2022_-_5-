115,5.0, Gyeongbokgung Palace is pretty but The look of her lover in a hanbok is so pretty I felt that I did a good job of making a custom copy 
116,5.0,Should be on the top of your list for tourist attractions in Seoul Lots of pretty grounds and historical buildings Well maintained and easy to navigate
117,5.0,This is a must see if your in Seoul 10 and 12 has the changing of guard ceremony which was very neat to see
118,5.0,A must visited place when you are a kdrama lover You can take so many instagrammable photo there Youll see the royal changing guard ceremony in every 15 minutes You can take a pict with the guards as well 
119,5.0,"I was in Seoul for only 5 days on a business trip and got 1 free morning and afternoon to enjoy the city before an evening flight and I was so glad I visited this palace! I stayed at the Plaza Hotel and it was about a 20 minute walk to the impressive front gates. There were guards dressed in period costumes you could take pictures next to and in the front you could purchase guided tours or get a free map to walk around. There are kiosks where you can buy tickets in any language which was helpful for me as an English speaker. They also rent period dress outfits you can wear and they waive the entrance cost (which was very cheap) and that was popular with the kids. I spent the better part of 2 hours walking the property and seeing the sites of this almost 700 year old complex. The pictures were beautiful, especially the gazebos on the water. There was also a small cafe and gift shop on the grounds to get out of the sweltering heat. If you only have a day to visit the city I recommend not missing the palace!"
120,5.0,"This place is huge. Be prepared to walk a lot and bring water as you will be in the sun. They offer English tours so best to check ahead and time your visit with the tours, otherwise you will be walking around looking at old buildings which can be pretty boring w/o hearing the back story."
121,5.0,"This is an interesting place to spend a major part of a day. Don’t forget to watch the changing of the guards, a highlight that occurs several times a day. Also make reservations online for a time to visit the Gyeonghoeru pavilion."
122,4.0,"Impressive and interesting palace though we preferred nearby Changdeokgung Palace, which has a more scenic setting. Gyeongbokgung is more out in the open. In addition to the palace buildings, the main things we liked about Gyeongbokgung were the changing of the guard ceremony and nearby location to the Blue House and Bukchon Hanok Village, which were both worth visiting."
123,5.0,"In going to Gyeongbokgung palace, you have an option to rent a hanbok from the nearby rental shops. They usually costs around 10,000-25,000 ₩, depending on design and gender style (men's are more costly). You don't need to buy tickets to enter the palace grounds if you're wearing a hanbok so remember that before you book online."
124,5.0,"It wasn't very busy when I visited (a Monday in June), and I loved wandering around for hours just enjoying the lovely architecture and nature. There were (free!) English- speaking tours, but I found exploring myself and reading the plentiful information signs to be more than enough to get a feel for this historic place. As other reviewers note, a must in Seoul!"
125,5.0,"This is must stop place. We rented hanboks for the day, so admission was free. The ground were lovely and expansive. Rent an audio tour or just peacefully enjoy the palace."
126,5.0,"Of Seoul's 5 Palaces, this is THE Palace to see. Built 1395, destroyed 1590's, rebuilt 1800's, destroyed again in the 1940's, restored once more in the 1990's, it's not just a wonderful escape from the hubbub of Seoul, it's a walk through Korea's history. Especially when you wonder through the gate to Korea's Folk Museum. Well worth the visit."
127,5.0,"Of all the palaces in Seoul, this is the main one and a must.  If your limited on time, definitely do this one.  As you can imagine, busy but with Korea having just reopened after C-19, not as bad as pre-pandemic times.  Go early.  I got there at 09:00 as it opened and I was done by noon.  It was packed by then.  Grounds are huge, when it starts to get hot you will struggle in the heat.  Entrance is cheap.  I timed my visit so I walked around for an hour, watched the Royal Guard Changing Ceremony at 10:00 (around fifteen minutes), walked around some more and then joined the free English guided tour at 11:00 for one hour. Check online the night before as they change timings and closure days. Perfect.  My free time allowed me to explore and the guided tour was good providing an overview to some of the main buildings as well as details I didn't notice walking alone.  Guided tours are not in many languages.  English was the only European language but this may be due to the limited tourists at present.  Take water with.  I may be wrong but there only appeared to be one cafe inside.  If you don't do the free guided tour, there are information booklets but staff are not that friendly and don't volunteer this information.  After you have purchased a ticket, go through the main entrance and on the right are the booklets in a few languages.  There are also information boards at some of the palace buildings with a few facts.  At the time of writing June, 2022 adult entry for a foreigner is 3,000 Korean Won.  If you wear the traditional Korean hanbok outfit (assume you can hire this nearby), then you can go in for free.  A lot of people were doing this but check the price first.  Unless you want to dress up and take photographs then do it.  If your doing it to go in free, the entrance is cheap and I think hiring the outfit may cost more!  Plus it is really hot (depending when you go).  The National Folk Museum of Korea is located at the back, free to enter.  Highly recommend going.  Although I was tired I did this after the palace (spent about an hour at the museum) and it was really good.  In total I was there for four hours to cover both.  Grounds are clean and well laid out.  If you do the museum, you cannot go back into the palace so do it after you have finished at the palace.  The museum exits into a main road where you can easily get public transport or a taxi."
128,5.0,"Mostly reconstructed complex from the Joseon era (Japanese damage and fires, etc.). They have obviously taken pains to rebuild the major structures using period techniques and we watched some craftmen working on one building with only hand tools. One pavilion needed two large trees of a variety that were no longer available in Korea so they were located and shipped from Canada!"
129,5.0,This was a beautiful area to walk around and learn some Korean history. The ticket price was very reasonable. Very nice gift shop/cafe.
130,4.0,"Part of a beautiful park, this building is one of the most attractive of them. Nothing seems to remain from the 14th century buildings and a lot from later needed to be repaired or even rebuild in the last decades. Still more than worth the visit!"
131,5.0,"Beautiful park in Spring. Good for leisurely walks and reading the introduction on plaques around the attraction. The guard changing ceremony takes place at 10am and 2pm, Recommend for photo taking."
132,3.0,Nice. Very traditional ceremony. Was there in December. Extremely cold. Good crowd. Make sure you have a guide to explain to you what is going on. Overall was nice
133,5.0,We visited last May 2019. This is a beautifully restored palace which draws you back to the rich history of Seoul. Got great photos of the place. If you love to walk around this place is good for you. It is also accessible through public transportation.
134,5.0,"Korea is not as famous as China or Japan, but many people don’t know that it’s culture started developing before the ones of the two more famous countries I previously mentioned. Gueongbokgung, in my opinion, has nothing to envy to the Forbidden City of Beijing. While walking, you can imagine to be in ancient Korea, with all the people wearing hanbok (for those who are unfamiliar, it’s the traditional Korean outfit)"
135,4.0,It is good place to visit if you walk lovers and would like to knownsome history. I went with kids . We enjoyed but avoid to visit in hot day.
136,5.0,Visit the palace with Korean traditional costume (you could book it at shops nearby) allows you to enter the palace free of charged. Most authentic ancient feel in Korea! So beautiful with a mountain view behind the palace.
137,5.0,Well I've been here last 2015 and it was a great experience travelling in this palace. I've learned so much about the culture and history in Joseon Dynasty. Also this palace is definitely a must see over all other palaces in Seoul. It’s enormous with many areas to spread out and explore. Highly recommended to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace!!!
138,5.0,"It's so fun to see the Koreans dressed up in traditional garb all LARPing and cosplaying. Seriously. Idyllic scenery and world-class museum. There's even a smaller museum that gives an awesome intro to the Jeoson dynasty for kids. The larger, official museum is a perfect intro for adults to this fascinating period in Korean history."
139,4.0,Great palace beautifully restored and a great walk on the beautiful ground. The price of the visit is really cheap compared to some historical monuments in Europe. The only down point with covid was no guided tour. Some part of the grounds are still under work
140,5.0,"I went back to this palace even during the Covid, just don't forget to follow the social distancing rule and a;ways wear your mask. I think this palace is still worth visiting. A good place to start if you want to know about Korean history, culture and amazing architecture."
141,5.0,"C ( 20.12.24 ) This palace was the best among Seoul's palace, and had various architecture in Choseon's period. The palace had Gwanghwamun and some architecture. There was good to walk with various view, and enjoy about Korea's history. Must visit on Seoul trip."
142,5.0,"Great palace, don't miss the changing of the guard, all in historical uniforms. Even in the Covid era it's still worth a visit."
143,4.0,Go by night. the colours and the lighting is incredible. The colour of the fall makes it even more special. absolutely worthed watching this and going for a nice stroll
144,4.0,"This palace is definitely a must see over all other palaces in Seoul. It’s enormous with many areas to spread out and explore. A small fee of ₩3000 is required to enter the grounds, but for the most famous/popular pictures you can take those for free without entering.  Warning...a lot of construction and renovation so you won’t get to see any of the water features in previous pictures.  Bring your walking shoes, lockers are provided for free on site. This is a great place to let the kids run around.  Located in the “heart” of Seoul, there are many places close by to explore further.  Only really need 1 hour, but can take up to 2 hours if you read all the signs and go in every building."
145,4.0,Well I wasn’t able to get inside the Palace as they were closed during the days I was in Seoul. But I still rented their traditional clothes and took picture outside. Pictures came out fine. I’ll definitely go and check this place out when I’m back in Seoul.
146,5.0,You can buy a 5 in 1 ticket that allows you to visit four palaces and one shrine that you can use over three days at your convenience.
147,4.0,"Visited Gyeongbokgung Palace as part of the free entrance ticket from Discover Seoul Pass.  Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised to stumble upon the guard changing ceremony, I later found out this takes place twice a day in front of Gwanghwamun, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung at 10 am and 2 pm (except on Tuesdays). There are also photo opportunities with the guards.  Entering the palace grounds, it kind of reminds me of Joseon drama. Quite a number of visitors were spotted to be donned in Hambok, which is a recommended activity to take you back in time.  There is also a small cafe and restrooms within the vicinity.  Overall, a must-visit if it is your first time to Seoul."
148,5.0,Great palace. I really enjoyed walking around. The Gyeonghoeru (pavilion overlooking the pond) was stunning. Some portions were under renovation during my visit (Dec. 2019) but it was still awesome.
149,5.0,"The palace is pretty big and nice, you can buy your ticket at the counter specially for foreigners. Also if you wear a hanbok you can enter for free"
150,5.0,i love this palace especially the change of guards in the morning.  though its cold and raining snow but the ceremony is still on going. lots of tourists even in winter season. Palace is too big to explore so you need to give your whole day for this palace alone.
151,5.0,"This is the largest palace complex in Seoul. Its history is very interesting! The palace is in reality a reconstruction; the original palace was burned and demolished by the Japanese during their occupation of Korea last century. The restoration of the palace is quite good. Unfortunately, most rooms are empty as their contents disappeared. Only the library in the back of the palace is original and its content is well-preserved. It still works as a public library. The floors, colors, roofs, and windows are original.  Some tips:  1. If you plan to stay in Seoul for at least four or five days and want to learn on the rich past of Korea, you should start you visit here.  2. You may spent the whole day visiting the palace grounds. It is quite relaxing, very well-kept, large, magical. There is a traditional, small tea shop within the palace where you can refresh drinking a delicious Korean tea in a Korean atmosphere.  3. Bathrooms are located in different places. They are impeccable.  4. Buy the ticket that covers all palaces. It is cheap. It last for several days. It will give you access to three other palaces (Two are close by), the secret garden (beautiful place), and the Jongmyo sanctuary. All are UNESCO sites. The sanctuary is far away and you need to take the metro. The palaces and the gardens are walking distance. This is why you need at least 2, (ideally 3 days) to visit all these sites.  5. If your interest is in in the rich past of Seoul ( Joseon period), the ticket is perfect. Look for a hotel in this area. Seoul is very big and crowded. Traffic is hectic and distances are enormous.  6. If you rent a Hanbok (Traditional Korean clothing) you will have free access to the palace. This is nice as it will make you feel more local and the pictures could be lovely. However, keep in mind that clothing is heavy and hot. We were there in September of 2019. It was a warm and humid day. It was not too hot. However, people wearing Hanboks shortened their visit because of how hot and wet they felt.  7. See the change of guards. We saw it at noon. It is a colorful symbolic, short ceremony. No many tourists; people behaved really well.  8. After finishing your visit, go to Insa Dong for dinner and shopping. It is really nice and relaxing. It takes 10-15 minutes to get to Insa Dong (walking distance). You may have ice cream midway."
152,5.0,"Its like stepping into a movie and reliving South Korean Joseon Dynasty again. This was so sensational. It is spectacular how this is divided from the modern world. If I were to go back to South Korea, I would visit more of the ''tradional'' places and visit this one again.  Not only can you relive this, but the art performances were also magnifying. I felt like a South Korean royal, watching the entertainers. I am looking for a song one of the Pansori singers sang but still am not able to find it after so many years"
153,5.0,"A visit to the palace is not complete without wearing the colorful Hanbok, Korea's national costume. There are tons of Hanbok shops around the palace where you can either buy or wear them for a fee. Upon entering the palace grounds, it feels like you travelled back in time with practically almost all visitors wearing the Hanbok. It will definitely make you appreciate the palace and the country more."
154,5.0,The palace is a vast complex and is a major tourist destination when visiting South Korea. Usually tourists visit this place while renting traditional Korean clothing to take pictures in the palace area. The palace is nice and very beautiful. Detailed architectural buildings with a variety of colors make the building in this palace a must visit.
155,5.0,"Highly recommended to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace at 9am as it’s quite empty, not many tourists yet. The Palace is very interesting with long history. There is a security guards gate change performance at 10am and it’s free. Anyway, the palace is closed on Tuesday. It's very convenient to visit as it's located in the heart of Seoul."
156,4.0,"I wasn't expecting much, but the history and details of this place impressed me. It is a large complex with many buildings. Each building has a unique and interesting purpose. Go with a guide."
157,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is a must visit, it has rich history where it was the main Royal palace. visitors can wear traditional dress if they like but myself I preferred to stick to my personal clothes so I can be more comfortable while exploring every corner in the palace.  The Palace had many sections & it takes few hours to explore it, so bare in mind to spend at least 3 hours."
158,5.0,"ユネスコ世界文化遺産で、大都会ソウルのど真ん中に600年前の王宮や広い王様専用の秘密庭園があってとても不思議な感じがしました。解説付きのツアーをお勧めしたい。色々説明を聞けるので一人で見回るより楽しかった。夜のツアーもとても雰囲気があって優雅な韓服を着て朝鮮時代の音楽やお茶会が体験できて超〜〜楽しかった。何回でも行きたい。It is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and in the heart of the big city of Seoul, there is a palace of 600 years ago and a secret garden dedicated to the king, which made me feel very strange.I would recommend a tour with explanation.I had more fun than going around alone because I could hear a lot of explanations.""The night tour was very atmospheric, and I had a really fun time to experience the music and tea ceremony of the Chosun Dynasty wearing elegant hanbok.""I want to go as many times as I want."
159,5.0,Very accessible from my hotel. Nice to see the week end families enjoying activities. Good atmosphere and plenty of space to rest. Perfect place for fresh air and walk around small lake. Enjoy
160,4.0,The palace is one of the most iconic heritage site in korea. Usually quite crowded but you can surely find some corner to take your perfect photo of the magnificent architecture and charming landscape. There are a lot of people in the traditional korean hanbok and it's a great place to take a stroll to immerse yourself in the korean culture.
161,5.0,"I had the chance to visit the site after a business meeting nearby, this is very impressive and gives an idea about history of Korea"
162,4.0,"Rent a hanbok and soak in the ancient Joseon vibes of the palace. Plus, entrance is free if you wear their traditional costume. Place was crowded though so no way you can grab any photos without a photo-bomber. Grounds can be covered in 2 to 3 hours depending on how interested you are in the place. Don't miss the changing of the guards ceremony at 10 am or 2 pm, but if you do, there's an hourly mini version of it"
163,4.0,Walking around the palace is a unique experience. It’s quite an experience to see how the Korean dynasties lived their lives. Great picture taking here.
164,5.0,We had a layover in South Korea and decided to take a tour for 5hours and not a moment we regret it. It was a blast. Tour guide was amazing. Food and scenery was lovely.
165,5.0,you can see the blue house in this area and there is a small museum you can see the history and presidents details
166,5.0,"This is one of the many palaces located in Seoul. It is located by the presidential palace, the blue house and has many ceremonial activities in front."
167,4.0,Infrastructure takes us to experience ancient times. A lot of diversified people & travelers you can see over there
168,4.0,The place is full of historical story and well maintenance. There are a lot of photo shooting area take you can spend a day of. You can also rent the traditional cholth here but better don't do it on winter season. Here also provide free tour guild but due to covid 19 this service is cancelled.
169,5.0,"Just incredible, how this Palace is built and preserve. The wide ancient gate even so beautiful from the first glance. Walking around there in Hanbok traditional Korean dress feels like traveling hundreds of years back to the Joseon dynasty. We didn't catch the palace changing guard ceremony but the palace itself already stunned us."
170,5.0,You must get a ticket to get in the palace. Its totally worth to visit. Try to spend 1 to 2 hours here to discover this beautiful palace.
171,5.0,"First Seoul and Korea were not our visit destination. We visited during a layover at the Incheon Airport. If you ever have a long lay-off and land before 8:00, do this tour. I could not stand the airport for 8 hours.  I researched about how this was the principle palace of the last dynasty Joseon to rule Korea in 1395 and how it was rebuilt in the 19th century after 300 of non use. In addtion, this is the site of the Japanese seat of government with its capital building on site that also served as the first seat of government for the Korean Republic.  While historically those all are true, the reason to visit is an amazing building that is incredibly painted with a series of gates and buildings that truly speak to the soul of Korea. The setting between mountains and the city is amazing and the juxtaposition of the palace to modern Seoul is stunning. The gates and the palace are the stars but the dining hall on the pond is an incredible building in a beautiful setting. The day we visited though it was cold, as there was ice on the pond.  We really only got to see one thing in Korea but I have to believe we saw the best thing with the most historical impact. Go and take the tour."
172,5.0,"Great for those who want to know more about the history and culture, and no you don’t really need a tour guide if you just want to take pretty photos and they had traditional wear for rental as well"
173,5.0,Beautiful architecture and mesmerizing to see and visit. Parking is comfortable. Easily reachable via subway. Food market very near the palace. Can rent Hanbuk for small amount and take beautiful pictures inside the palace. The palace is a marvel of Korean history. Must visit if you are in Seoul. You may need 30~40 minutes to skim but I recommend longer stay and see the beauty in the marvel.
174,5.0,"Highly recommend getting a guide, as the information brings the Palace to life! We got there by 10 am to seeing the changing of the guard. We learned about the gates, the Palace, how the king and queen lived, and so much more. Great palce to get pictures."
175,5.0,"My wife and did Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Presidential Office the same day. Gyeongbokgung Palace was built in 1395, so it is good historical site. The day we went you saw so many people from so many different nations. The Presidential Office was a great tour. I caution you to reserve a ticket before you go to South Korea. They have a mandatory 14 day advance on reservation. You will also need your passport during the tour. This is where the President of South Korea works and lives. After both tours, we enjoyed lunch in the area."
176,4.0,"We rented those traditional Korean clothes, Hanbok, and took many picturesque photos. Worth doing. There is a cafe in the palace and so you can relax there in between taking photos."
177,4.0,Mostly loved the changing of the guard at 10 am and 2 pm . However if you miss the big ceremony they have a small change every hour at the front gate . If you rent traditional Koren national dress you get in for free so lots of locals do this and there are lots of photo opportunities
178,5.0,"Took a tour of the palace. Got some great photos, saw the changing of the guard ceremony and learned some history. It's definitely a must see if you visit Seoul"
179,4.0,Saw many people in hanboks which I thought added to our overall experience. Thank you to all these people!  The palace was big enough that it never felt too claustrophobic even though there were many visitors. I also liked how reasonable the admission fees were and how accessible it is.
180,3.0,They also have free guided tours at few intervals of day. Local wear traditional attire while visiting this place.
181,5.0,"In my opinion this is the best palace in Seoul. I would reccomend renting a hanbok from across the road if you can since they are beautiful, and entry to the palace is free if you are wearing one. The changing of the guard ceremony is cool to watch. The vibe of this palace is very touristy with many girls taking pictures in their dresses however this is a must if you want to take breathtaking pictures of Seoul. This was one of the highlights of my trip!"
182,4.0,Super awesome place! I really love everything from here . Would like to go back again here! Super worth it
183,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace, the ""Palace Greatly Blessed by Heaven"" was the first palace built by the Joseon founder in 1395.  As far as we understood based on our tour guide; the site of Gyeongbokgung Palace was at the heart of Seoul and deemed auspicious according to the traditional practice of geomancy. Gyeongbokgung Palace provides a glimpse into Joseon's royal culture, palace life and architecture.  This palace happens to be the largest of all five grand palaces built in the Joseon Dynasty, remaining in Seoul. The palace is beautiful for visits in all four distinct seasons in Korea.  Visitors can enter Gyeongbokgung Palace through all four sides of Gyeongbokgung Palace. Gwanghwamun Gate (main gate) on the south, Yongchumun Gate on the west (newly opened on 6 Dec 2018), Sinmumun Gate on the north and National Folk Museum of Korea entrance on the east.  Another relevant info is that the Gyeongbokgung Palace was destroyed by fire during the Imjin War (Japanese Invasions, 1592-1598), and the site remained vacant for the next 273 years. It was later restored during the reign of King Gojong.  We were there around 12:00 noon therefore you must see the change of guard as it is a must. You can see my pictures here as I place some for this particular matter. I’ll try to upload a video although a bit long, very interesting indeed. Enjoy it as we did, although I have a feeling if we went in Spring the trees and flowers would have bring a more dramatic and pleasant look to the premises.  But I don’t complaint as thank God the day was sunny and the temperature bearable. Definitely a must go place during your stay in Seoul."
184,4.0,"We went in January so it was too cold for us to go around in the traditional Korean outfits. A lot of people were braver than we are (if you are wearing the outfit, you get to go in for free), so we saw a lot of people walking around in traditional Korean wear and it was cute to see. The grounds are pretty so it is nice to walk around and enjoy the view."
185,4.0,"I’ve read that access to the entire grounds isn’t free.. but that wasn’t the case when we went. Maybe the entire grounds were open for the Lunar New Year?  The architecture was magnificent and seeing the old palace with the new urban city in the background was something else!  We also stumbled upon the changing of the guard, a very interesting ceremony."
186,3.0,It was rather small and the inside of most buildings could not be viewed. The highlight of the site was currently under maintenance.
187,5.0,"This palace is from the Joseon dynasty, located in the Jogno district. They have the royal changing of the guards ceremony at the main gate (check timings). Once inside one can just stroll through the different courtyards, view the various buildings or take a guided tour. Just outside the palace gates you have many Hanbok (traditional Korean dress) rentals. You can dress up and have pictures taken inside the walls of the palace. Hanok Buckchon village is also within walking distance. There is also a cultural street lined with traditional Korean restaurants."
188,5.0,The palace is relatively small compared to most Chinese or western palaces.. Tour guide told us that’s because it was Confucius influenced but we got to see changing of the guards and our guide was so detailed that made the visit so much more interesting
189,5.0,Beautiful gardens! The gardens was my highlight of Seoul! The tour guide was knowledgeable and communicated the history in a fun and interesting way! Well Done.
190,5.0,A true historical treasure in the heart of downtown Seoul. This amazing palace draws you back to the rich history of Seoul and Korea. Easily accessible through public transportation. Close to many other cultural attractions.
191,4.0,Rent a hanbok and you can enter the palace free of charge. Hanbook rental can be found nearby the palace (to the right of the palace entrance).
192,4.0,Easy to reach Gyeongbokgung palace with public transportation and many small restaurants not too far from the palace.
193,4.0,"I've seen so many palaces already, that this is the only one I decided to visit during my trip here. The complex is huge. It's nice to walk around. I was a bit dissapointed that the teahouse all the way in the back was under construction. Lots of girls and a few men were dressed in traditional clothing. You can rent those nearby and I read with them, the entrance to palaces is free (this palace is 3000won). Lots of good photo opportunities and especially away from the main palace it was nicer to walk around, less people. Try to see the changing of the guards! It's outside the palace so free. I think 10, 11, 13 and 14."
194,5.0,The Palace is a piece of history in the quiet setting in downtown Seoul. I dressed as a Palace guard in traditional garb.
195,4.0,"a beautiful historic place, wonderful to see the interiors of palaces how they were originally, with the decor and all. lots to see, need quite a bit of time!"
196,5.0,"Do take the English tours for better understanding and insight on this place, it is a huge Palace with lots of beautiful picture spots. Visit the Folks Museum and Palace Museum so you get a holistic view of Korean past."
197,5.0,"Winter in Seoul is very cold, but still great to go around the beautiful grounds of the palace. Also, try to witness the changing of the guards ceremony. It was awesome and very colorful. Wondering how the guards kept warm during wintertime? Highly recommend to visit"
198,3.0,"A rich in cultural and historical value place to visit.Lots of visitor tourists during the winter holidays. A must visit to their HISTORICAL AND Cultural Museum located directly within the Palace vacinity. The museum inside is clean, quiet and warmy-heated during the winter .Has free locker service to accommodate our outer winter wears etc. Another tourist attraction free for viewing."
199,5.0,Maybe it would be more crowded in non winter time. I was surprised to be the only few souls wandering in the largest palace in Seoul in December.  There are many different buildings aside from the main hall. Do get the brochure to understand what each of them signify.
200,5.0,Really beautiful palace and gardens. Not to be missed. I took so many good photos here. You will learn a lot about architecture and the royalty during the visit.
201,5.0,"It is one of the largest palaces in Seoul. There is a lot done in regards to restoration which in some parts is maybe to shiny, shiny. The new and more remote areas feel almost like a fake movie set. However the main areas are amazing but after a while it feels the same due to the same colour scheme and structures. You do get a good feel of the history. Having visited the Forbidden City not much will ever compare. In Autumn the trees have beautiful colours so spending half day wandering was great."
202,5.0,The palace is well visited by tourist and locals. Do not miss the 2pm change of palace guards ceremony. The ceremony takes place outside the gated zone but getting a ticket to visit the palace is totally worth it. The place is huge and we spent at least 1.5h walking around because we wanted to fully explore the gardens and rooms.  It might be a good idea to rent hanbok costumes for the visit.
203,5.0,Want to go back in time and enjoy Korean History -- always a top site on my visit list each time in Korea.
204,4.0,"This isn’t the most beautiful palace in Seoul, but it is impressively large and strolling the grounds is very relaxing. It’s also in a fun neighbourhood and near several other attractions."
205,5.0,"This palace is so much more than it appears to be from the street! It is massive! While many of the building are similar, guided tour helps sort out what buildings were used for what. The changing of the guards was colorful and worth working into the schedule. Great day of walking and learning!"
206,4.0,"It is a good place to visit during your free time but not to a great place to explore. I have lots of more beautiful places like that when I was in Mongolia, so it wasn’t really woow."
207,4.0,Went to the palace on a Saturday braving the public protest. Witnessed the guard change which was quite impressive. The palace grounds were large and massive but as unguided found it difficult to appreciate
208,3.0,"Nice stroll around but in terms of palaces, it is nothing to wow your senses after you have seen forbidden city in Beijing. They have lovely pine trees there though."
209,5.0,Expansive palace with regular change of the guards at the entrance. This traditional palace right in the centre of the city is amazing. Tourists and locals alike rent the traditional Korean costumes when roaming around takes you to an atmosphere of several centuries in the past. A traditional village nearby is also a must to visit. Unfortunately my visit was cut short by heavy rain on the day. Need to go back again in summer when it should be very enjoyable.
210,4.0,such an amazing place to visit. we got a chance to wear a hanbok and moved around the palace..like we transfered back to Joseon Dynasty..love the feeling so much.
211,5.0,Beautiful and historic spot in central Seoul. A must visit if you visit South Korea. Make sure to catch the guard change too!
212,4.0,"This historical place is every tourist's destination!  Albeit all the tourists coming in, my fiance and I found the place amazing. It will take you about 2-3 hours to tour the entire palace! Our only regret is we didn't bring a selfie stick so we had little pictures of the place with us in it.  The entire palace is an interesting sight. We did not regret coming here. :)"
213,5.0,"As really beautiful palace but full of tourists wearing Hanbok in the afternoons. For a quiet time, arrive early (e.g. when it opens). There's a museum towards the left of the Gwanghwamun gate and it's free admission. King Sejong and Admiral Yi bronze statues are a must visit too."
214,4.0,Beautiful grounds. Historical and informative. We especially enjoyed seeing all the folks wearing the traditional folk dress.
215,5.0,"Make sure you take in the changing of the guard, we did the 1030hrs. Also do not miss visiting the museums, both are well worth it; best to set aside most of the day to do the museums justice."
216,5.0,My husband and I walked here from Insa-Dong area. The Insa-Dong visitors center was very helpful and provided us a map to the palace. This place was very cool. Cost $6 usd which is very reasonable. There were lots of visitors but it wasn’t so crowded that it made the visit unenjoyable. The museum on the premises is very helpful with providing more information about the palace that isn’t explained on the grounds.
217,5.0,"Very beautiful and historic. Take the time to understand some of the history and try to put yourself in that time. It was so cold the day we visited so we wondered how they kept warm, from the servants all the way up. The artwork on the buildings is beautiful. People dressed in traditional clothing made the experience all the better."
218,5.0,"This place is huge, elegant and historical. There are a few guards changing event, but the main event happen @ 11am."
219,5.0,"easy walking, visit king n his work place, his family living room etc. also praying place, dining area n servant living area."
220,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace was the first and largest of the royal palaces built during the Joseon Dynasty. Built in 1395, Gyeongbokgung Palace was located at the heart of newly appointed capital of Seoul (then known as Hanyang) and represented the sovereignty of the Joseon Dynasty.  Beautiful architecture and they restore the building quiet well after the first palace was invaded by the Japanese back in 1945 - 1948 where Korea was attack, much of the building in the palace was run down and destroyed, they were moved to the second palace in Cheongdeokgung Palace.  There were beautiful matching presentation to shows how the army and General March during the dynasty and how they serve the king during Joseon Dynasty. Lovely wonderful place ☺️☺️☺️"
221,5.0,This is a must see place if visiting Seoul. Could have spent a whole day there were it not for limited time. Would love to return.
222,5.0,"This is one of the main sights in Seoul. It looked like most was modern reconstruction, but it was still very impressive. The place was clean and quite large too. There are so many museums and galleries close by too."
223,5.0,"Very beautiful grounds and buildings. Most fun was visitors dressing up period costume (guess they are available for rent) and taking photos, etc."
224,5.0,It was a beautiful place to spend your day walking around this palace. It is clean but no food available. Entrance fee was reasonably cheap. It is near hanbok village. Great experience for my family.
225,5.0,Easy to locate the rental hanbok stall and short 3 mins walk to the palace. Saw the guard changing ceremony. Guards look so cool and good looking! Ha!
226,5.0,"An essential part of any visit to Seoul. Unsurprisingly, the palace is a smaller version of the Forbidden City in Beijing. If you are wearing traditional Korean costume (hanbok) you get in for free, so when we were there about a third of the visitors were wearing traditional Korean garb, which gave the whole experience the feel of being at a masquerade. Do not miss the changing of the guard at 10:00 AM. There is an adequate English tour at 11:00, at no extra change."
227,5.0,"If you're visiting Seoul just for a day, do not miss Gyeongbukgung Palace. Also wearing a hanbok allows you free entrance on most attractions in Seoul."
228,4.0,"Such a beauty palace and plenty of nice places to take pictures(especially if you have rented a hanbok)! Protip: it cost 3K won to enter the palace but if you wear a hanbok, you get to enter for free!"
229,5.0,Very inexpensive and gorgeous grounds to explore. Don't miss seeing the changing off the guards. My teenagers loved it!
230,5.0,"Beautiful architecture, it is somehow like a scaled down version of the Forbidden Palace in Beijing. Missed the change-of-guards though. If you are one to look at details, you can spend a whole day here. Entrance to palaces in Seoul are considered cheap. This palace entrance fee is KRW3,000 but I opted to purchase the package that include few more palaces as well for only KRW10,000. Weather was pleasantly cool in November, and the autumn leaves are stunning"
231,5.0,The Palace was huge. My family and I went there pretty early to take photos. A must watch is the changing of guards.
232,4.0,"It has some semblance to the Forbidden City but on a smaller scale. Dont miss changing of the guards that takes place at intervals.  Two types of tickets: palace only at W3k and a 4-Palaces combi ticket at W10k. We went for the cheaper one.  The main throne hall sits majestically in the centre with other buildings behind, linked by covered walkway. Behind the complex is a garden (I imagine it would be beautiful in summer) and a stream. There is a souvenir shop and toilet. There dont seem to be a place where we are allowed inside so we only take a peep through the window.  An experience to immerse yourself in the imperial Korean times."
233,5.0,The place is quite big but not as big as Forbidden city. But the place is spacious for foto shoots. Better wear themed Hanbok for contrast on the building color. Use the Discover Seoul Pass for your hanbook it’s a wise choice.
234,5.0,"We eventually found this place - got mixed up with other Palaces. We watched the Change of Guard and got some pictures before they moved off then did the English tour (free). Our guide was easy enough to understand but we felt her english was very parrot - struggled to answer non scripted questions. Having said, that the tour was informative and took us to lots of different areas of the Palace. We spent just under 4 hours in total exploring."
235,4.0,"Meticulously reconstructed in the heart of Seoul, this visually impressive site is worth a visit for the crowds of Koreans (and some Chinese) walking around in Korean traditional costumes and for the contrast with the skyscrapers in the background. OK, most of the woodwork is modern, but the actors and the costumes make it quite an experience. Great for western kids."
236,5.0,"It was a great feeling to visit such a well maintained historical place like ""Gyeongbokgung Palace"". Recalling the history by visiting the entire place, palace after palace was eunique."
237,5.0,"Visited this place 2x last month since i didn't know you can't go deeper inside into the palace. In case, if anyone wants to see their guard changing time, 10AM and 2PM"
238,3.0,"We were lucky to visit this place on a sunny winter day. Surprisingly, the place is crowded with tourists and it was a challenge to take pictures in the Korean traditional costume. If one wears the traditional costume, then one can enter the palace for free and there are a lot of lovely spots for photo sessions."
239,5.0,"Amidst the hustle and bustle of the city outside, the palace remained serene and one felt like being transported back in time as it has retained its beauty of long ago. What was most interesting is people walking around wearing the traditional Hanbok added to its charm. It's a must see when in South Korea."
240,4.0,"An excellent day was spent on a days escorted tour of Seoul with a lovely guide whose English was very good. The day started with a visit to a store where we were all dressed in Hanbok , beautiful traditional Korean costume for our visit to the palace. Make sure you are there by 10 am for the colourful changing of the guard ceremony.The Palace itself is lovely and reminiscent of the Forbidden Coty in Beijing , just on a smaller scale. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes as there is lots of walking involved"
241,4.0,Nice Place but I just could not get excited about it cos it is not the real thing cos its was rebuilt. A must visit when you ate in Seoul. Try to spend the day around that area. A lot of restaurants and beautiful cafes around the area.
242,5.0,What a wonderful place and so full of history. We took the free guided English tour and she was fantastic. Funny too. I learned so much that day. Such a pretty place.
243,4.0,"This is a very large open area. The buildings can only be viewed from the outside. I find it amazing that the colors seem so fresh while being exposed to the weather. It was interesting to see so many tourists dressed in traditional hanbok costumes, especially when they are taking photos of each other. Didn't know that was a ""thing"" until later. The changing of the guard is an interesting ceremony to watch."
244,5.0,"It is a magnificent building in the middle of a modern buildings. It is easy to locate and nearby got great ginseng chicken soup. If you are not shy, you can rent a hanbok to walk around in the palace. A lot of tourists did that!!!  The place is clean and easy to walk around, there is guides if you need one. Free entrance if you wearing hanbok. Overall is a great place for sightseeing"
245,4.0,"This is a large expansive complex that really requires at least three hours to experience. And with the ridiculously cheap admission rates, you will definitely get your money's worth. A lot of people (locals and tourists alike) enjoy renting traditional Korean clothes (hanbuk) and often mill around throughout. Photos are accepted; just politely ask first. It really is a 5 star attraction; I am just not into this type of thing and would rather spend my time in a local neighbourhood hanging out which is why I gave it 4 stars."
246,5.0,"Highly recommended to take the free guided tours available. We took the English one and the guide brought us deep into the palace grounds where there were hardly anybody. She also gave a very good background to tje history of the palace and gave us some insight.  There is a pre-parade at 945am at the right gate (if u are facing the palace) towards the open air carpark & public toilet. That is worth watching and not many people know about it. After the pre-parade is over, u have sufficient time to walk over to the main parade square to watch the changing of the guard. Best spot is on the left of the kids only area and facing out towards the main gate and main road. Here u can watch the guards marching in from the left and moving towards the main gate."
247,5.0,Let 's go to Soul. The amazing place that many travellors love to visit. Many youngers with beautiful costume walk around there for taking beautful costumes.
248,4.0,Pretty crowded on weekends but an interesting place to visit for the history and culture aficionados. Palace grounds are huge so expect a fair bit of walking from one attraction to another
249,5.0,"At the heart of Seoul lies this ancient yet historically significant center of the Joseon dynasty - the Eternal, Grand, Beautiful and Enchanting Gyeongbokgung Palace, the largest and grandest of the 5 palaces built during the Joseon dynasty in 1395 by King Taejo, the first King of Joseon.. It is the seat of the King, His household and the government. To date it is one of the most famous attractions in Seoul and South Korea. Millions of tourist visit this Palace and it is a must visit. You could take the Seoul metro and could alight at Gyeongbokgung station which is connected via Heungnyemun Gate or outside via Gwanghwamun station and you need to walk via North direction passing by the statue of King Sejong the Great. The National Palace Museum of Korea is located via Heungnyemun gate. The entrance fee to this palace is around 3K Won for adults. As you enter the main gate of Gwanghwamun in the south you will be greeted by several other gates as you walk north into the Geunjeongjeon (Throne hall). The cobbled stones floor indicates that you are entering history. Other significant buildings include the beautiful Gyeonghoeru Pavilion (Banquet hall) with a lake surrounding it, Gangnyeongjeon (King's residential quarter), Gyotaejeon (Queen's quarter), Hyangwonjeong (2 story Hexagonal shape pavillion on lake connected by Chwihyanggyo bridge), and many more. We went here during Fall season and it's magical we were surrounded by trees of red, yellow and orange. The wind blowing adds to the beauty of the falling leaves. Despite the plenty of tourists we have space to take beautiful photos and videos. There are even Korean cultural dance shows with photo opts afterwards. Behind this massive complex stands the mighty Mt. Baegaksan (a 342 m high granite mountain) a perfect background for your beautiful photos and videos. Some tourists rent traditional Hanbok dress, a traditional Korean clothes. Rental prices vary depending on the time starting at around 13K to 15K Won for about 4 hrs. It adds to the total experience you could get while walking around this historical palace not to mention it adds beauty to your photos and videos. Between 10 to 3 PM the traditional changing of the guards occur every hour which is a spectacle of Korean culture and tradition. We left at 5 PM which is also the closing time at this Eternal Grand Palace. It is my 2nd time to visit this but it still amazes me every time."
250,5.0,"The Palace is definitely worth visiting! To see everything and take photos, you need around 3 hours. We did this around The Changing of the Guards. The changeover is impressive and lasts about 20 minutes. Get into the palace about 140pm for a 2pm changeover, this means you get front row viewing! The clothes they wear are amazing. While there you can see lots of people dressed in traditional hanbok clothing which adds to the experience. You can actually hire the clothes yourself before visiting the Palace."
251,3.0,Not much to see in buildings. There are free english guidances but the english speaking is not very undertandable.
252,5.0,"You must take the free tour but do look at the timing from their website. The tour is about 50min that bring you around the palace and explain history behind each architecture.  Give yourself about 2-3 hours there including the change of guard ceremony (check the timing on their website) should be sufficient. After this, we walked to Bukchon Hanok Village which is about 20-30min walk."
253,5.0,"The palace with its vast grounds is more than 600 years old and reflects Korean traditional architecture. Don't miss the changing of the guards ceremony at the Gwanghwamun gate at 10 am and 2 pm. It is quite elaborate and different. You get to pose with the guards for photos, after the cermony. Entry fee is 3000 won per person. But if you are wearing a hanbok (which you can rent from shops nearby), entry to the palace is free. If you are planning to visit multiple palaces, consider buying an integrated pass for 10,000 won with which you can visit four palaces and the Jongmyo temple."
254,3.0,"It’s alright. Not much to see. There isn’t a lot of activities, it’s mostly just different areas of the palace"
255,4.0,Huge palace consisting of various buildings and a large garden. Take the guided tours or the self-guided audio tour which is really well done. The place is usually crowded with people dressed in traditional Korean costumes (which you can rent across from the palace) which makes for good people watching. If you wear the costume entrance is free.
256,4.0,"The area around the palace is quite interesting so. The likelihood is that you will spend around this palace many times. While I prefer the Changdeokgung Palace, it is a large and rich site with a good garden too."
257,4.0,"The entire area is huge! We kinda in rush on our trip as we want to see the guard changing order which was scheduled at 10am and we have book a tour at another palace at 1130am so we didnt have much time to explore the area. When we were there, it was raining the night before and the water turns ice in the morning!"
258,5.0,"Went there with guide, made all the difference. It brought the palace to life, with its rich history of past life. Much more rewarding with a guide."
259,3.0,I went to the palace on a whim and it was totally worth it. It’s an awesome experience especially if one visits during the change of guard ceremony. There’s a lot to see at the palace and it offers magnificent photo opportunities. I recommend a visit here for anyone going to Seoul.
260,4.0,"Definitely a place to go specially if you don't have much time to visit Seoul. It will give you an idea of Korean culture. The site is beautiful and you can walk around the parks. Close to the subway, free guides in different languages at set times."
261,5.0,It was fantastic to see in person this palace that I always see in the dramas. I felt like I was living in the Joseon Dynasty. Great architecture of the buildings.
262,5.0,"When we arrived at the gates of the palace we were ushered inside the palace walls for a ceremony. Such good timing especially as the ceremony took less than ten minutes. Every 4th Wednesday is a special day and it is free to go in. There were lots of people in National dress looking very fine all glittering hooped skirts for the ladies and over large tall hats for the men. If you wear National Dress on any day it is also free to go in. The ground was very uneven and may be tricky for elderly to walk on. The grounds are massive, there was so much to see. It was originally built in 1395 and served as the home of Kings of the Joseon dynasty, and been extensively restored after various conflicts all but destroyed it. Well worth a visit. Take plenty of water and good walking shoes."
263,5.0,"The park is beautiful specially with all The tourists (mainly Chinese) wearing the hanbok for a traditional look and photos. Don’t miss the changing of the royal guards at the main gate at 10am and 2pm everyday when not raining, except Tuesdays"
264,4.0,"it gave you glimpse of Korean history good place to visit, clean and very informative when you walk through"
265,5.0,Free entrance to the palace if you wear Hanbok. You can rent Hanbok dress from nearby shop outside the palace. Take as many pictures as you can. It is really fascinating to see other visitors wearing Hanbok as well. It's like in the Dynasty era. The palace is so huge. You can get free English tour guide at the main entrance. Just check the time schedule.
266,5.0,"It happened to be chuseok when I visited so my Daughter and I gained free entrance. It was pretty impressive seeing lots of people, locals and tourist alike wearing the traditional, hanbok outfit. We also managed to watched the elaborate changing of the guard ceremony and then roamed around to admire the palace amazing structures."
267,5.0,"I was not much interested about this place before going to this palace.Once we reached there,I rented an Hanbok for ₩9000/2hrs and hair braid ₩5000.Then that's it,you are ready to capture shots. It was raining heavily when we were there but still it was good.You could hire a guide there so that you will understand the history and culture of that palace.You will find museum which is free entry in the same compound.You can spend around 2hrs in that museum.Overall it was good."
268,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace although had been rebuild is worth visiting and one can definitely marvel at its architecture. Added bonus will be to see the changing of the guards in front of Gwanghwamun, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung at 10:00 am."
269,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace has been likened to the Forbidden City in Beijing but at a more subdued state. I think however that this is a wonderful experience in itself! So come to the palace for its own sake!  A magnificent piece of work, although a replication since the original build if NS have been burnt down by the Japanese except for the chimney and some salvaged beams (in a well-catalogued display) shown in a little hut towards the back of the Palace grounds just before the second palace. Unfortunately the explanation is all in Korean (so the newest Google translate app with the camera function is your best friend here!)  There are complimentary language guides at designated times through the day if you are interested but the information can be found online and at the website rather than the brochure. QR code’s and audio guides should help with the visit.  Oh, do note that if you wear a hanbok, you enter the palace for free!"
270,5.0,"Historical site, Gyeongbokgung Palace built more than 3400 years ago. Great to see this ancient and majestic architecture! Complimentary entry for elderly above 65 years old. (Need to produce passports) and those who wear hanbok."
271,5.0,"Majestic place, November is the best time to visit of you want to experience cold weather. Cable car and hiking to experience best shot at the top of the mountain."
272,5.0,A beautiful and great place to go and take photos. The place is full of history and it is a big area to walk around so you must wear comfortable shoes there.
273,4.0,"Seemingly simple, compared to palaces elsewhere, the tour guide was exceptional in providing a history of Korea."
274,5.0,"After watching so many traditional Korea dramas, finally we can tour around the palace in traditional costume to experience the Korean culture. The Palace is incredibly crowded as expected but it does not spoil the mood of back to the past. There is guard change ceremony 2 pm every afternoon and children area is available. Fantastic experience!"
275,5.0,A beautiful palace that takes several hours to see properly. If you plan to visit any other palace or Jongymo Shrine buy the Combined Ticket as more cost effective. The Pavilions are especially lovely. There is no set way to go around and most buildings are empty (the Throne Room is partially furnished). If you hire a Hanbok (costume) entrance is free (depends on weather if you do this as they are not rain friendly).
276,5.0,"The change of guards ceremony was interesting and fun to watch. There was quite a lot of people, but not too crowded. A must see attraction in Seoul."
277,5.0,you will be surprised by the size of the palace and the few visitors; i visited at visiting hours and in some part of the palace I was the only one...it is like you have a private tour; take some guide to explain what you see to enjoy even better; very well preserved;
278,5.0,"Great place to spend the day alone, or with friends an family. The architecture is ancient yet stunning and you get a glimpse into the Royal lifestyle from the past. Would definitely recommend."
279,5.0,"Learnt so much about the beautiful country, its traditions, culture and its rich dynasties. Absolute must see"
280,5.0,"Best scenery and relaxing. The areas of the palace was so big, and there are museum too, I would suggest whole day trip, they closed around 5pm, and entrance fee is just 3000won/adult (Affordable)."
281,5.0,"one of the best place to enjoy autumn if you are around Seoul. You can make haft day trip by visit Gyeongbokgung, Samcheong-ro and Anguk , all closed to each others and walkable"
282,5.0,"This is a good place to visit if you love to watch period Korean dramas and if you love historical buildings. There are many areas you can explore in Gyeong-bok-gung. (Gung means palace in Korean.)  The palace is very big so if you want to cover exploring the whole palace, give yourself the whole noon till evening, to visit this place.  There are some description of each building and areas to read but not a lot to read. If you want to learn more about each area and building, it would be good to have a guided tour in your own language. The little description placed there are not very detailed and do not explain much about the whole place.  I went this palace about three times on three different tours and each time was different. With a tour guide, you would learn why the floor is sand and stone (so that the guards could hear if someone is around to prevent assassination.). Without a guide, the floor would seem like it is just bare from tourists stepping all over.  You could enter the Palace for free if you are wearing a Korean traditional costume!  You could rent a traditional Korean costume from nearby shops just outside the palace. Try to rent them online in advance and go there early to collect them. The rental packages usually comes in 2 hours, 4 hours, 6hours or one day rental. And they are considered very cheap and affordable to rent! I had a 4 hour rental with additional 2 free hour package for only 24 SGD.  And because the shop was very near, I changed into the costume and entered the Palace in just a 5 minutes walk. And after visiting the palace and taking photos in the costume, we went back to the shop to return it and changed back. The whole process was very convenient."
283,5.0,"I visited this palace at least once a year, sometimes several times in a year. They have extended the night visits (from 7 pm), from the normal late-Oct. to Nov. 6 this year. Foreigners with a passport can get the night visit ticket by queuing up at about 6:30 pm, on the left-most lane of the ticket office. The pagoda in the centre seemed to be still under renovation (for a long time now)."
284,5.0,"Get off at Gyeongbokgung subway station on the red line, take exit 5 and the entrance is steps away. Be sure to be at the Palace's first courtyard by 9:30 am as the changing of the guards takes place at 10am. The procession involves around 100 people in period dress. You'll get a better view of everything if you're at the front of the crowds. This event takes about 30min. While the changing of the guards are the highlight of this attraction, there are lots of photo ops from rest of the palace grounds."
285,5.0,"Another reviewer recommended watching a Korean drama to put this place into context and I couldn't agree more. Check out ""My Country"", currently on Netflix. I would recommend going a little later in the day. We were over run by a swarm of pushy school kids. I also recommend taking a tour. Our English language guide was a wealth of information and energy! Her drool sense of humor was unexpected and hilarious! Lastly, the Folk Art museum (free with paid ticket) was awesome and sells unique items if you're looking for upscale but affordable souvenirs."
286,5.0,Korean palaces are simple but elegant and this is one of the best. Before you go try and watch a Korean historical drama to put it all in a little context. What makes it special is hundreds of people are dressed up in traditional Korean dress. You get in for free if you do and it certainly livens up the photos
287,5.0,Very beautiful place. When in traditional dress for free otherwise entrance 6 EUR. Good places for pictures.
288,4.0,"Wonderfully restored historical jewel, in a fashion reminiscent of chinese and Japanese palaces - here you can see the life of ancient rulers of Korea."
289,4.0,"One of a few royal palaces in Seoul, I think this is the largest. Very interesting architecture. A lot of different sections/parts to see. Can spend a few hours here. They have walking tours in different languages. It's quite a contrast to the modern buildings around it. You can get free entry if you dress up in the Korean national/traditional dress hanbok."
290,4.0,"Walking distance from where you can rent Hanboks is this palace.  It is well preserved and provides the best background for your Joseon inspired photoshoot.  Since there are many visitors, in regular clothes and in costume, it takes patience and good timing to get that perfect travelling in time, kdrama scene, hanbok shot. But oh so worth the effort!"
291,5.0,"I visited gyeonbokgung evening tour with my friends wearing hanbok.. we were able to tour the palace and see it in daylight and night time.. it was so beautiful! We were lucky as there was a traditional korean music performance on the palace grounds as well, so we got to experience that😊"
292,4.0,"It’s worth noting it is closed on Mondays. Don’t make the mistake I made. I can back when it was open and was here to the changing of the guards, it was a little over rated"
293,5.0,"Around Gyeongbokgung, there’s a lot of Korean national costume rental shops . For you to create your own imagination how you look like when you are in Joseon Dynasty. Lots of fun with taking many pictures with your friends. ❤️❤️"
294,4.0,Guessed this is a place for people who like to take photos. Not suitable for people who does not like to take photos.
295,5.0,I loved the old place with change of leaves. Taking leisurely couple hours of walk with a friend on a weekend was a perfect way to relax & catch up.
296,5.0,Huge space with lots of historic buildings in a nice garden area. You can walk around and discover things for several hours. If you rent traditional cloths you can get in for free. Normal fee is 3.000 for adults an 1.500 for kids above. Don't miss the guard changing ceremony at 10am. Be there 10 minuits before to get a good spot for watching. Dont miss the national folk museum right next to the palace garden.
297,5.0,"As other palaces in Seoul, Gyeongbokgung Palace is not very large. But it has more interesting buildings, more varieties. I like smaller court yards in particular. If offers many good photo spots."
298,5.0,"This is probably the most popular attraction in Seoul for both tourists and locals. It was very busy and everywhere there were people wearing national dress (hired from shops in the area). We timed our arrival for the changing of the guard which happens twice per day, it was colourful but not too serious. The palace covers a vast area and comprises a complex set of impressive buildings which are loosely interconnected. Most of the rooftops are highly decorated following the style of most historic buildings in Seoul but they have obviously been restored recently. The price of entry was very cheap although the secret garden is an additional cost (we didn't have time to go there). Just next door is another royal palace, Changgyeonggung, which was much quieter and is on a smaller scale but has lovely gardens."
299,5.0,Everyone is wearing Hanbok and no entrance fees if you wear Hanbok there. Good place to take photo and the palace is still well maintained.
300,4.0,Must visit if you are first time arrive In Korea.You can learn and observe history of Korea from this palace.Free entrance if you wear hanbok .Nice for sight-seeing and you can captured all nice picture.
301,4.0,"Other reviewers may say that it is not as fantastic as other palaces in other countries but you cannot compare. It is pretty spectacular and nice to see that a cultural treasure is continuously being restored. The experience was really interesting and a worthwhile experience. At first I thought it amusing that so many people dress up in traditional dress to do the tour but once I got to walking around the extensive area, I realized they were having real fun! The changing of the guard is worth getting there for a 10am start."
302,5.0,rented the hanbok to capture photos with the palace as the background. beautiful and well kept palace with many great spots to take photos. the palace and its compound was huge.
303,5.0,Arrived here just in time for the changing of the guard and were glad we caught it as the spectacle of the different costumes is not to be missed. If you plan to see the other palaces too get the Royal Palace pass - it doesn't save you much money but it does mean you don't have to queue up for tickets again so saves a lot of time. Lots of beautiful buildings to wander around.
304,3.0,"In Korea, you must go and see some of their palaces. From a cultural point of view it’s interesting to learn the history and court life. But it’s nothing compared to palaces in other countries."
305,5.0,"Visited this palace while I was in Seoul for business. It’s absolutely beautiful and the changing of the guard ceremony is so interesting to watch. If you’re in Seoul, definitely check this out!"
306,4.0,"I visited Gyeongbokgung Palace with my wife some time in October 2019. Both of us had a great time exploring the palace and taking a lot of pictures. It must be especially fun for visitors who come visiting, wearing traditional Korean attire (which are readily available from any of the many rental shops in the vicinity). Lots of photo opportunities for your family/ travel albums and social media.  We were lucky to be there when the changing of guards took place. Pretty cool. Would recommend to anybody visiting Seoul really."
307,5.0,I only had a day for sight-seeing and this was an excellent site for a sunny day. I took advantage of a free walking tour which I would highly recommend and there is not much in terms of explanations at the various buildings. Allow for 2 hours to walk around if you have a tour.
308,5.0,"Go there, take some pictures and escape the noisier parts of Seoul. You‘ll find lots of people in traditional dresses, which is nice to look at"
309,4.0,This palace is middle of city. Big and we can hire the Korean traditional clothing here and around here. Enter fee was W3000-W5000. When you are in Seoul see this place. One thing this palace is so busy..so many peoples are here!!!
310,4.0,We enjoyed looking and wandering around this historic sight. It covers quite a large area and there were many tourists dressed in traditional Korean clothing which was also fun to see. Worth a visit.
311,5.0,"The breathtaking views and amazingly well kept palaces and grounds made it seem like I was back in ancient times.  You can spend an entire day sitting in front of the clear lake watching the large golden fish swim by as you drink your coffee, or walk the paths along the green lush background as you enter different parts of the palace.  A great way to thoroughly enjoy this palace is to emerge yourself into the culture! If you rent a traditional Hanbok (tradition korean dress) admission into the palace is free. I’m sure the rental of the outfit is more than the palace admission but let’s face it, we travel for the experience!  A definite must see!"
312,5.0,"It's a huge area and in the middle of the city. I had rented a traditional Korean dress from near by store...hence, the entrance fee was waived because of that. It has a long history. Wear comfortable shoes as you have to go around wide area. It's a fun place to take pictures with the palace and Korean dress."
313,5.0,After five visits to Seoul I feel this is a must see if you’re interested in the history and culture of the area.
314,5.0,"For me a must visit when in Seoul. You need to wear comfortable shoes in exploring the place as it is big area. When a visitor is wearing the Korean traditional costume “Hanbok”, there’s no need to pay for entrance. One can rent for the costumes in many different rental stalls nearby."
315,5.0,"It was very interesting to visit Palace, on the enter they offer me to dress up like ancient warrior, we also visited museum."
316,5.0,"The buildings are beautiful and well maintained, lots to explore for 2-3 hours. Many Koreans in national dress add to the spectacle. Don't miss the changing of the guards parade, the costumes, flags and ancient weapons are very impressive. The entry fee is very reasonable."
317,4.0,Probably a must see for every first time visitor to Seoul The free tour was great 1330 and 3 or so other departured from the main gate
318,5.0,"We visited this gorgeous palace early on a Saturday afternoon and encountered a massive crowd of tourists in the big courtyard behind the Gwanghwamun Gate. These visitors likely lingered after watching the colorful changing of the guard ceremony, which takes place Wednesday through Monday at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Though we missed that afternoon’s performance, we had watched it here on one of our previous visits to Seoul. I consider these palace ceremonies, which are free for the public to watch, to be one of the great values for tourists in the city.  Many of the people we saw here had rented traditional Korean attire from a courtyard shop to wear into the vast royal complex beyond, which requires an admission fee. On the palace grounds, they posed for selfies and for others, who wanted to capture them in front of the various well-maintained buildings, such as the throne hall or the crown prince quarters. These separate structures throughout the grounds give good insight into the living conditions for royalty during the Joseon Dynasty.  Gyeongbokgung Palace, in use from 1395-1592, burned during the Japanese invasion and was not rebuilt until 1865. We found the well-shaded grounds to be immaculate and a pleasurable place to stroll. Water features include a lovely ornamental pond. This is the largest palace from the Joseon Dynasty that still exists and would be my recommendation for the one palace to see for those with time constraints.  Located in Seoul’s Northern area, the palace can be reached by subway, line 3 to Gyeongbokgung stop, exit 5.  ,"
319,5.0,"Just got a very good experiences in Gyeongbokgung Palace. I have good trip to this peace place when stayed in Seoul last week. The design is so amazing. And the atmosphere is also good.Many beautiful trees, Recommend this place for any people who come Seoul."
320,5.0,The palace design is amazing. The craftsmanship needed to to design and build it just blows my mind. We wore the Hombaks (traditional dress) to get free admission. It was a beautiful experience and a walk back in time.
321,5.0,I visited this palace as a part of incheon transit tour. It was a beautiful palace with peaceful surrounding. The place was clean and well maintained.
322,5.0,Local feels Beautiful structures Beautiful hanboks you see everywhere Turn back the time in ancient Korea
323,5.0,we did not go inside to visit the palace. we were interested in the changing of the guard. the ceremony was great.
324,5.0,"This palace is beautiful. On a nice day it is an incredible place to walk around. The juxtaposition of the old vs the new city is amazing. There is plenty of shade if it is hot, and even a little teahouse. You can spend hours here just wandering around."
325,4.0,"If you're interested in history & culture, visiting the palace is a must. So many places to see from the King & Queen's quarters, throne room, banquet hall, etc. Try to catch the changing of the guards which has a great ceremony, brings you back in time with their costumes, music & performance. At certain times, there are free guide tours in english"
326,4.0,It’s an impressive place so I recommend at least walking through it. It’s 3000 per person so go there if you are doing the gardens at Changdeokgung palace or are walking in Bukchon Hanok Village. It is a nice place but I found it a bit weird that tourists were wearing traditional dresses while walking around the palace.
327,4.0,"Great preservation of the grand palace. We were so lucky also to witness the changing of the guards, apart from taking selfies with so willing pretty korean ladies in hanbok costume!"
328,4.0,"A traditional space that is evidence of its past, very vast. If you get your timings right there are also reenactments using actors in traditional attire. The site is very busy until you get far from the paid entry section."
329,4.0,"Anyone will be awed by the grandeur of this palace. I love that people are encouraged to wear the traditional hanbok. Gives the place a more regal atmosphere while adding a nice splash of colors! We did not bother paying the entrance fee, it was enough to be amongst the crowd in the middle of the field. I love the guards and their towering height, would have been more meorable too if we experienced the changing of guards. There are 2 shows per day, best you check the site because we somehow missed the afternoon show due to wrong information.  TIPS: If you are planning your itinerary, this palace is located at the end of Gwanghwamun Square with the mountains at the backdrop  If you will ride the bus going here, alight at the STOP right BEFORE the Gyeongbokgung station - it'll save you 5 minutes to walk back to the place  If you intend to rent a Hanbok, alight at the Gyeongbokgung Station where all the rental shops and hairdo experts are before reaching the palace grounds  Check the schedule for changing of guards  DO NOT FORGET to eat at the Tosokchon Samgyetang for some stuffed chicken soup that will revive your soul!"
330,4.0,"The palace is packed with tourists. We instead went to the farthest area north of the front gate where it was too far for tourists to go to. The view of the mountain was stunning. You can also imagine yourself walking as a resident of the palace hundreds of years ago. Oriental magpies and Brown-eared bulbuls make the palace come alive, not to mention the autumn foliage blazing in the background. You're going to have a great experience of the attraction where there are less people, in my opinion."
331,4.0,"Went here as our first sightseeing excursion Seoul. Great cultural experience as they were performing a reenactment of a ceremony. The grounds are huge and you could easily spend a half day exploring the property. They give free tours in several different languages at different times, which is well worth it. Our guide was knowledgeable and super friendly, and eager to answer any questions our group had. The palace is easily accessible from the subway with a short walk from the nearest station."
332,5.0,"Arrive on the hour so you can see the changing of the guard. Arrival it looked relatively small, but it’s deceptive and gradually reveals other buildings and depth to the complex. A great few hours to learn more about the history of Seoul/Korea. This amazing complex is surrounded by the modern city."
333,4.0,"Still my favorite palace to visit Seoul after having done Changdeokgung, changyeunggung & deoksokgung.  Dont forget to also watch the guard-changing ceremony, Royal palace museum & national folk museum (including the outdoor exhibits), which are ""outside"" the palace perimeter but just outside the gates. And free to visit."
334,4.0,"While this palace complex is similar in layout to the Forbidden City in Beijing, it is much smaller and less grand. If you visit on the hour you can see the changing of the guard ceremony. The costumes reflect the period when this was the Korean capital. This ceremony was worth the visit alone."
335,5.0,This is the largest of the five palaces located in Seoul. It is closed on Tuesdays. It has changes of the guard that is a very colorful and ceremonial event.
336,5.0,"It’s really easy to find the Palace, there are signs from the subway station all the way to the place.  We went during Chuseok, a national holiday, so entry was free. It’s a really huge palace with plenty to see.  Make sure to bring your selfie stick or camera, there are so many gorgeous views, buildings and gardens so you’ll definitely get some fantastic pictures.  It’s also beautiful to see people dressed in traditional Korean hanbok. As mentioned, we were there on a holiday but I think you can usually rent a hanbok for some photos.  It started to rain a little bit the day we went, but it was still really pretty."
337,5.0,"The tour of the Palace took us 4 hours! Unless you're running through it, you cannot do it faster (OK maybe 3-3,5h is possible too). We went there for the 11 o'clock gate guard change (a shorter ceremony) and finished it with the 2 p.m. General guard change ceremony. Both are for free and can be enjoyed even if you don't go to see the Palace. The entrance fee is ridiculously low, so you will definitely get more than you're paying for. We also got the audio guide as it provides detailed information about different buildings and the history. It's available in English, Korean and Chinese. It's not a must as you can read the signs to get some information but we felt like having an audio guide is easier as you can listen it while exploring. What we absolutely loved and recommend is the hidden café- Saenggwabang, the Dessert Department! It's located in the Palace kitchen buildings, so you need to look for it as otherwise you will probably not just stumble on it. We went there around joon, which is the perfect timing as later most of cakes were already sold out. You can purchase the traditional cakes as well as herbal tea and enjoy it in their lovely little café, on the floor. We absolutely loved the experience! I believe we paid like 9000won,which is ~7€, for a pot of tea and 4 cakes. We really wanted to buy some to go but that's unfortunately not possible, which is actually understandable as they want to keep it a unique experience."
338,4.0,Palace that has interesting history. Most of the original palace buildings have been destroyed. Few have been preserved and some rebuilt. Guard changing ceremony is the interesting part and the guards try to stay still but you could see their eyes wandering and enjoy the giggles from visiting tourists
339,5.0,The place where you can view the traditional palace and pavilion including its beatiful park and background of mountain.
340,5.0,"Really enjoyed our time here, especially the palace garden where the glass house is (not the Secret Garden, we didn't have time for that one). It is so peaceful and interesting, and not full of crowds. Take a picnic with you and make the most of the lovely gardens and quietudr. If you are seniors, do take ID as entry is free for over 65."
341,5.0,"Amazing palace It's very old palace and amazing please You can see every thing from past You can spend more 4 , 5 hours"
342,5.0,"I would say this is the largest and most grand palace in Seoul. The grounds are enormous with much to see. We went in the morning to see the changing of the guards, which my kids found fascinating. They even had a roped off section for children to sit so they could see better. If you could only see one palace this is the one."
343,4.0,"This is a huge complex, made up of several sections. If you are going to visit don't make any other plans for the morning. Get there early, before the tour groups and school classes on field trips. The folk museum in particular gets over run by crowds after 11:00. The architecture is beautiful and the location in the heart of the city makes it easy to access. A definite must see in Seoul. The sites are mostly exterior; meaning, you do not go into most of the buildings, but it is still worth the visit."
344,5.0,"Of all five palaces available for visiting in Seoul, this one is the largest and grandest, the one in my opinion most worth visiting. Be prepared for a LOT of walking, a lot of steps as the palace occupies quite a bit of ground and there are steps required to go up and down peering into all the different palace buildings.  Get the audioguide - it is well worth it. The quality of the guide itself is superb in terms of the technical design; the English voiceover is also excellent.  Notes: - If you do get tired, I would say the outer reaches of the palace are ones that you can probably miss. E.g., the section where they held the deceased king/queen, the pagoda (which you can't climb up to) - Entry to the pagoda section is strange, or the signage was unclear. The ticket booth there is not for you to purchase entry to see the pagoda; apparently that's a separate entry point into the palace grounds instead. You can walk straight out and get back in, if you are coming from the palace grounds already"
345,3.0,"The entire complex is vast. Definitely worth a visit. If you have interest for the history then we highly recommend a tour. Because of the scale of the site it’s easy to miss some interesting parts.  They did not provide a map where you purchase the entrance tickets, it would be useful, we asked and the shoed us along.  It’s a popular attraction especially on Sunday. 3000 Korean won per person. Allocate at least one hour for this attraction. The washrooms are large and very clean."
346,5.0,One of the most beautiful parts of Seoul. Among the restored buildings you can see what life was like in the old days. I recommend you go early because after 12 noon there are plenty of photo tourists.
347,5.0,"We did what many tourists did, which is to rent the hanbok or traditional Korean costume for a few hours and walk around the palace. Note that if you are dressed in hanbok, you can enter the palace for free although it will still cost you more to rent the hanbok than the entrance fee.  The palace is large and it took us at least a couple of hours to walk around, taking photos and watching the change of guard ceremony.  Note that the change of guard ceremony takes place once in the morning and another time to in the afternoon. Try to catch it if you can as it is quite elaborate and there is an English explanation of the ceremony over the PA system."
348,4.0,"Tool subway and easy to get there. Entrance fee is cheap and full of tourists. Many ppl wear traditional Korea clothing entering the palace. Ticketing queue at the main entrance is always long in the morning. From the staff, there are 2 more ticketing entrance which has far less ppl at the side and back. The palace is huge and you could spend more than half day walking and taking photos. It is worth visiting for first time."
349,5.0,"It is no comparison with palaces in Europe, India and China but it still offers many good scenes to take photo. It is easy to go. the change of guards ceremony is as attractive as many other places. You can spend a couple of hours there exploring leisurely and take good photo. If you have more time, spend 30 minutes to enjoy the tea ritual. One amazing thing is that many people wear hanbok around producing a special ambience. The president resident is nearby and the ancient Hanok Village are nearby. Hanok Village is also worth going and there are many good local restaurants around."
350,5.0,You will enjoy beautiful Korean-style buildings with their so specific wavering roofs with the mountains in the background. Another thing can be highlighted: the reflection on the water; with the sunshine it is amazing. The place Is worth visiting
351,4.0,"Had a very good time in the Gyeongbokung place, the place you must visit if you are travel to South Korea, you can get more information from the museum, Morning time is good. you can dress handbok and spend time on the premises with that outfit."
352,5.0,"I had a nice, peaceful visit to this place. It is vast and has many palaces to see. I walked around and saw many trees, flowers, and places to sit. The signs are in Korean and English and give history on each of the buildings. This is a fabulous place to take a stroll through. I enjoyed it immensely."
353,5.0,"Had a really enjoyable day here, looking around the place and all it’s surrounding, must see all the places when in Seoul."
354,5.0,We took our group of 3 adults and 8 children here for the day. The littlest ones had a great time as they could wander easily and play in the dirt. Beautiful photo ops. Many choices for Hanbok rental to make some amazing photo memories. (Renting a hanbok gets your free entrance- no need to wait for the ticket booth!)
355,5.0,We strolled for hours in the vast palace compound and enjoyed every bit of it. It's beautiful and maintained in good condition.  We would recommend to come in the morning so you can enter also the museum (closes at around 17:00~18:00).
356,5.0,"Built in 1395 Gyeongbokgung Palace was abandoned and rebuilt in the 19th century and again destroyed by Japan in 1911.Two pavilions and the throne room survived. It is famous for the changing of the royal guard twice a day in front of Gwanghwamun, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. (except on Tuesdays). It is very colourful and special.While you are waiting try the Dunkin Donuts opposite!t"
357,5.0,We ended up renting hanbok (Korean old-style fancy clothing) before going into the palace which meant that we got free entry. The palace grounds are stunning with lots of good places for taking photos especially if you are wearing hanbok. There is a beautiful pond on the right side of the grounds if you enter through the main gate. You can also see a large mountain looming over the palace grounds. Unfortunately we couldn’t see the whole grounds because we had to leave after two hours to return the hanboks. There is also the Korean folk museum and modern art museum nearby though we didn’t have a chance to go. You can’t walk into the buildings but other than that the palace is definitely worth going to.
358,5.0,"The changing of the royal guard takes you back in history to a tradition from the Joseon Dynasty, being a must for all fans of Korean culture.  It is held at 10:00 and 14:00 (except Tuesdays) and lasts less than 30 minutes. We arrived at the earliest one and the weather was ok (not too hot for early September). Since a large crowd gathers, I would recommend arriving at least 15 to 20 minutes prior to the event.  The best way to stand is with your back to the National Palace museum of Korea as guards enter from 2 different entrances; facing this way prevents missing part of the action (as some of the people did)."
359,5.0,"I visit with a study abroad group from Chonnam Univeristy and it was amazing. Beautiful architecture, beautiful ponds, and foliage. Would 100% recommend"
360,4.0,"My wife and I went to check this spot out and it was great.  There is a subway station attached to the place so it's super easy to get there.  The museum is free and quite interesting, some cool old restored royal cars and other stuff.  The palace is impressive and well maintained. Tons of photo opportunities, if you are in to that.  Recommend renting the costumes, it's fun and they let you in for free if you wear it."
361,5.0,We have visited several palaces in Korea and this is the best so far. Two unique features include a little library and lake where the royalty had events.
362,4.0,"I've been coming to Seoul for business for many years now but rarely have had a free day so today I decided to walk from my hotel up to the palace and it was well worth it! The palace grounds are immense and most have been restored to their original splendor. The entrance fee is very cheap (3000 won) and free if you are wearing traditional Korean dress (as I saw many people doing).  I decided to rent the audio guide (which was also 3000 won) and that helped a lot to help me learn about what I was seeing. Having been to major palaces and historical sites in other Asian countries, I felt kind of bad that I had not taken the time to learn more about Korean history but I am very glad that I went. Highly recommended!"
363,5.0,Surprising and a magnificent view at the lake in the winter. I usually come to this palace in the spring and fall time. But this time I had some friends visiting from overseas so I embraced the cold to show them the palace. Not a hint of disappointment.  Pretty cold to wear Hanbok but the picture well worth it.
364,4.0,"Very large grounds to explore. 80% of the visitors wear (rent) traditional korean dress. On the plus side, it's good photo opportunities and there is a lot to see. I recommend audio guides as there are very few signs telling you what you are looking at. Down side, a lot of open space with nothing but tourists to look at No grass for the most part just dirt and the walking paths are uneven granite stones."
365,4.0,"A must go if you're in Seoul. We got there just in time for a reenactment of a royal ceremony. Quite fascinating place. And very large compound. Lots of good places for pictures. If you have a chance to rent a full Koren traditional outfit, I'd recommend it. Makes the experience better (and photos) better."
366,4.0,"The biggest palace in Seoul, there is guided tour in English and in Chinese or you can just walk around at your pleasure. Has a breath-taking pavilion, beautiful architecture for photography at the surroundings. One of the pavilions is under repair work and will take many years more to complete, such a pity. You can rent hanbok from shops outside the palace, and then your entrance will be free."
367,5.0,"It is one of the places where you can see traditional Korean palaces. There is Gwanghwamun, and the scenery of night and day is beautiful."
368,4.0,"The oldest and biggest palace in Seoul. It is very near to Gyeongbokgung Station. It tells the history of Joseon kings and their life and rule. It is a must-see when visiting Seoul. Admission is 3000 won per pax. However, it is free entry for visitors wearing hanbok, senior citizens aged 65 and above and every last Wednesday of the month, it is free entry for all. Daily changing of guards is at 11am and 2pm. However, it could be cancelled due to special events. In addition , the National Palace Museum of Korea has a great collection of art and archival materials over 500 years of history from the Joseon Dynasty to the Korean Empire. It is in the vicinity of the palace and admission is free too. While visiting this palace, many visitors would find their way to eat the famous ginseng chicken soup at Tosokchon Restaurant or eat at Tongin Market which uses traditional coins for food purchase. The overall experience is one stone hit many birds."
369,3.0,"This is a very big palace area and the museum also very good.good architecture,photography and surrounding buildings good."
370,4.0,"We hired traditional hanbok dress so we’re allowed in to the palace for free. The grounds are huge and the decoration is amazing. The one thing to note is that whenever you go, there is very little shade so if it’s a hot day, make sure you have water. There is a small shop in the grounds, but as a result is very busy. Overall the palace and its surroundings are really interesting and worth a visit."
371,5.0,"Enjoy the autumn colours and the beauty of the grand palace. Best to visit first thing in the morning, there will be lots of tourists and Korean wearing Hanbok (traditional Korean costume). You can rent the Hanbok for the day and walk around the palace and apparently, if you are in Hanbok, you get to go in for free."
372,5.0,"This place is magical. Its exquisite, so well kept and historical. Definitely worth stepping out of the airport for on that 12 hour transit. So well worth it."
373,5.0,"Before visiting the palace I went into the free museum which is situated inside the walls of the palace, beautiful inside. You pay for tickets at a small booth very reasonable price, once inside all I can say is stunning"
374,4.0,"If you want to take photos and wear hanbok- this is the place to be! If you want a deeper understanding of the history, get a guide. The grounds are expansive and you can spend hours wandering especially if you visit the museum there. However, note that it is not pram/wheelchair friendly. Also, lines to get tickets can get really long."
375,5.0,Especially worth to see a ceremony. Great to see everyone with the traditional costume and if you dare to rent one your entry is FREE!  Have tea at the tea house when available
376,5.0,The palace is really nice. Has a museum in there too. Lots of lovely Korean kids dressed up in traditional wear.
377,5.0,"First time here after rent hanbok at one of the store for 4 hours. Free entrance to Gyeongbokgung Palace if you’re wearing hanbok. Luckily no rain as the palace not all sheltered and it was hot day. Enjoy taking photos all around the palace and great experience to watch the Changing Guard. I spend the time here for 3 hours include my coffee break at one of the cafe, should put more indoor seats as all customer feeling hot and need aircon! Overall its a huge palace, nice to walk around and get many nice spot to take pics wearing hanbok."
378,3.0,"If you would like just to have a look at the neighbourhood, the grand palace and people strolling with their traditional hanbok, you can just stay outside and take wonderful pictures without having to soend your money getting inside as there were not so much to see."
379,3.0,We went there thinking this is a real historic palace to only learn from the tour guide that it was rebuilt after WWII (the Japanese had demolished the original palace and built a modern government building on the same site!)
380,4.0,"Nice big complex, with múltiple buildings, historical place , i take with tour compañía, But cheaper by subway, a must if you go to seoul"
381,4.0,"Everything about this Palace resonates history and the rich culture of the Koreans. Entry is free for vistors in the traditional outfit (Hanbok) and at a low cost for visitors without the outfit.  There are several shops near the near Palace where you can rent a Hanbok for 1 to 2hours. The cost of renting my outfit was ₩10,000 for 2hours. The palace also has a park where you can have lunch after some sightseeing. This is worth your last penny. Enjoy"
382,5.0,"I visited Gyeongbokgung Palace on March 10th 2019, for me was a cold day since I live in the carribean, and thought I'd love to wear a hanbok, i could bear to be in thos very thin fabric dresses, so I skip that and pay the fee to access the palace.  The place is HUGE I walked and walked and walked is seem endless. I visited the museum of South Korean history,was very interesting and very big too.  The building I love to watch the most was the main building where the throne of the King was, and to watch the show of the change of guard at the main entrance of the palace.  Was a great experience and I highly recommend it. Z"
383,5.0,"Unforgettable visit, will definitely return for another visit next time in Seoul! Very traditional architecture!"
384,5.0,"A visit to Gyeongbokgung should be on everyone’s list when visiting Seoul. It was the main palace for the Joseon Dynasty, the last dynasty before the Japanese colonization in 1910. It is significant historically, but also worth visiting because of its beauty. Be sure to rent some traditional clothing before going in to get some unique pictures that will be truly memorable!"
385,5.0,"We had the fortunate timing of watching the palace guard change ceremony, and it was an event to watch. For those who are multi-lingual, the broadcast is in 4 languages: Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and English.  The palace itself is grand, even though it's not the same scale as the Forbidden City in Beijing. Still, it is worthy of a visit."
386,5.0,We really enjoyed walking about the palace and learning some of the history. The dynasty and royalty is fascinating and the structures are beautiful.
387,4.0,"If you ignore the whole place was rebuilt not long ago and hence isn't particularly original (although, of course, rebuilt in its impressive, historical, form) it is definitely worth seeing. Sprawling, busy and imposing it is a must when visiting Seoul."
388,4.0,"Very nice place to visit while in Seoul. Historical site, not to crowded. Spend nice time there. Recomend it for everyone visiting even if they have little time. However is not worth to wait for the change of guards."
389,5.0,Tried on a hanbok and had fun being silly photo taking and walking around the palace. Saw a cordoned off throne seating area. Walked the grounds in the summer heat but still enjoyed myself.
390,5.0,"This palace (mostly restored) is the oldest of the Joseon dynasty. Free for those over 65 and note that 64 in US counts as 65 in Korea (bring your passport for proof of age). Otherwise, just 3,000 won.  Very large and many photo ops. Be sure to spend time in the free Palace Museum just outside the paying area."
391,4.0,"Take metroline 3 (orange) and get out at Gyeongbokgung station. This is a must see/do when in Seoul. It´s one of the most well maintained historical sites I have ever visited. Like many ´main tourist attractions´ it´s full of tourists, but because many locals like to rent traditional clothing and walk around all dressed up it gives you a very authentic feeling (until you all see people taking selfies and you are reminded they are from 2019 and not from the past). For me it was a great way to get to know Seoul/ South Korea on my first day. I went on my own for a quick visit, but if you have a chance to do a guided tour and learn about it´s history I think that would be very interesting. The place itself is huge and you can easily hang around for two hours. Later I found out there was a huge chunk of the park I missed (the water part) because I crossed over to the National folk museum, which is also well worth a visit by the way.  If you have more time and feel like walking a bit more, you can also visit the Bukchon Hanok village at about 500 meters distance."
392,3.0,"Nice enough, but big open space and after you’ve stared at it for 5-10 mins...wondering what to do with one’s self."
393,4.0,"On the dates posted on their official website (in Korean; not in English), foreigners can purchase up to 4 tickets at the ticket booth with a valid ID/passport. When I visited in September 2019, nighttime ticket sales started at 6:30 pm. Visitors were able to enter the palace at 6:40 pm, and were guided to go out at 9:00 pm. Hanboks (Korean traditional dresses) look gorgeous with the palace's night view!"
394,4.0,"The buildings, the grounds and the history are incredible. Everything you see is historic. To start, we took the #3 train and got off at the Jongno station, exit 1 takes you straight to the palace and museum. We got there right when the changing of the guards had finished so be there by 10 am or 2 pm if you want to see it. But we were able to go on the 11 am guided tour in English, it is free and it is the only way to know what you are seeing because most buildings look the same. The tour takes an hour and then you can walk around by yourself. It is very inexpensive, around $2.50 US unless you dress in traditional Korean clothes, then it is free. At the end exit towards the Seoul Library and walk to the Bukchon Hanok Village ."
395,4.0,"Very nice place, great to come over the weekend and see the local Koreans dressed on their traditional clothing"
396,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace was the royal palace of Joseon dynasty. Our tour guide, Erica, gave a detailed history of this dynasty and the sons fought with each other to occupy the throne and that lead to the construction of the other main palace. She explained about the summer and winter offices and rooms considering how hot and cold the temperature reaches during theses season in South Korea. Also, the change of guards is one of the major attractions of this palace. Don't miss it. Must visit."
397,5.0,"An amazing, sprawling site you have to visit in Seoul. Get there by 10am on a weekday and you'll have a perfect view for the changing of the guard. it's an awesome show. Rent a traditional hanbok at a shop nearby, get in free and supercharge your instagram, yo."
398,5.0,"Since we booked a nearby hostel, it was just a good walk from our place. The palaces are quite interesting which gives you an idea of how they used to lived during the old times. It was a good thing that it was not crowded when we visited so we really enjoyed the beauty of the place."
399,4.0,"This Palace has some beautiful architecture & bugger structures than Seoul other palaces, but this makes it a lot busier. The buildings are set in a classic structure - as you pass through the biggest & most regal first, then lots of structures of lesser quality follow after with buildings & Court yards to either side. This Palace is easy to wander on your own without a guide. The route follows through to the National Folk Museum & also the is the National Museum of Korea at the side."
400,5.0,"Love this Palace in every season. The Main Royal Palace of the Joseon Dynasty - if you are going to visit just one cultural site on your visit to Seoul I would recommend the Gyeongbokgung Palace. You can tour on your own, help a student volunteer offering a tour, or join a free guided tour offered by the management office in English, Japanese, Chinese, or Korean. Entry is a reasonable 3000 for adults, 1,500 for juniors and free for under 6y or over 65y. Changing of the guard takes place at 1000 and 1400 inside the Gwanghwamun gate and Gate Guard duty performance outside the gate is at 1100 and 1300 daily. Even without seeing these performances wandering through is worthwhile, you can see the blue house from the far corner of the grounds, and the National Folk museum entrance is connected to the eastern side. Highly recommend to all - accessible and enough room for the little ones to get some energy out."
401,5.0,Gyeongbokgung Palace itself was easy to find! (Stop at gyeongbokgung station). Rent a hanbok and you are able to enter for free !! I must say the palace is big and beautiful😍 As for me i really want to visit the palace as i always seen it on tv so seeing it in real life is amazing! Its big that you need 2 hours to explore the whole area and there’s alot of pretty spots where you can take photos with your hanbok!! Definitely recommend to visit with your hanbok because you’ll feel like you are a princess/prince!! But of course there will be alot of tourist so come early so there not much people!
402,5.0,A wonderful slice of history brought to life. Probably most easily navigated for tourists as part of a city tour. Note that there's free entrance to the palace for people in tradition Hanbok dress.
403,5.0,This palace is a must-see if you are in Seoul for the first time. We visited on a national cultural day so many visitors had rented traditional clothing which made the visit even more colorful and entry was free this day. This palace is immense with many internal sections so plan on spending a few hours walking around the grounds. It is possible to rent headphones with a device where you point to a spot on the map and it gives you a detailed history (available in multiple languages). We witnessed the changing of the guard (at 10 am) which was a colorful event. The gardens and ponds in the back are serene and beautiful. There is also a museum full of national treasures from the Joseon Dynasty. Definitely worth a visit!
404,5.0,"If you're coming to Seoul, this place is a must see. The grounds are huge so be prepared to do a lot of walking. The view of the mountains is very majestic. You can rent a hanbok in nearby shops so you can enter for free which i highly recommend if you really want that Korean feel during your tour and take nice pictures in centuries old architecture."
405,5.0,"The palace is sooo big... and many photo spots in here. Bring your camera. And dont forget to watch guard ceremony @ 11.00 AM, and 14.00 PM ..."
406,4.0,This castle was completed in 1395 shortly after the founding of the Joseon Dynasty. It was destroyed during the Japanese invasion of 1592 and was reconstructed in 1867.During the Japanese Occupation between 1910 and 1945 most of the buildings were torn down and work continues to fully restore the place since 1990. It is large and impressive and provides an interesting perspective of Korean history. It can get crowded but the grounds are extensive so it is not an issue.Access is via the Orange Line at Anguk or Gyeongokgung Stations.
407,5.0,"After a while the palaces start to look alike, but they each are beautiful in their own way. Best viewed in the winter or after a storm because the skies are usually cleared of smog and yellow dust. Take your time while walking around, take ur all in."
408,3.0,"If you are just looking to do what everyone ‘should do’ coming to Seoul, go there, rent a ‘traditional’ costume and take lots of selfies for your instagram posts. Otherwise stay away. Most of what you will see is less then 20 years old and there are so many dressed up tourists, it feels like carnival. There are much better places to get an impression of historical palaces. On the other hand, the two musea on site are worth it. One is focused on daily lives of Korean people through time and the other one boast a solid collection of the interiors of the palaces."
409,4.0,We came here on a cloudy day and didn’t choose to go deep into the palace compounds by paying an entrance fee. Tourists were soaking in the atmosphere with their rented hanboks.
410,4.0,"Great place to visit if you are in Seoul, gives you a good feel of life back in the emperors time. Only knock is there are no real signs or plaques explaining what your looking at, but for the couple of dollars changed to get in, it was well worth it."
411,5.0,Nice and worthwhile visit to the best palace complex of the city.. Try to have a sunset visit that will give you a unique and less crowded experience
412,5.0,We recommend to visit this magnificent palace during weekends so that you can engage a volunteer tour guide to show you around the palace and giving you more insights into the Korean dynasty era. A nice place for history lovers!
413,5.0,The interesting thing about the visit was we had to dress the traditional hanbok or Chosŏn-ot and visit the palace. We were lucky to arrive during the changing of the guards at 4 p.m. The changing of the guards are done twice a day in the mornings and evenings.
414,5.0,"Very beautiful palace that is super huge with lots to explore! Very photogenic palace. My friend and I got our hanbok rental + photography services on Klook Travel. It was a great experience and we went home with a lot of lovely shots to remember the day. Do check out the weather forecast before going! It happened to be drizzling when we went, which made the hanbok skirts wet and difficult to walk in, but the air was really nice and cooling! I personally think I enjoyed it better with the drizzles than if it was a really hot sunny day. Just avoid pouring rain and bring an umbrella in case. Here's a lil more about the place :  > Largest & most beautiful of the 5 Grand Palaces > Built in 1395 > represented the sovereignty of Joseon Dynasty  Entrance Fee is 3k won FREE for seniors over 65yo, visitors in hanbok (you can rent nearby) and on Culture Day (last Wed of the month)  > Free guided tours in 4 languages between 10am - 4pm > 2 types of Guard changing ceremonies between 10am - 2pm (Changing of palace guard ceremony inside Gwanghwamun gate & Gate Guard duty performance outside Gwanghwamun gate)  > FOOD TIP : There is a Tosokchon Samgyetang nearby which is very well known for their Korean Ginseng Chicken. It is on the left side of Gyeongbokgung Palace.  If you liked my review, do me a favor and give me a thumbs up please? :) I hope to share more as I travel! Thank you! Happy traveling!"
415,5.0,"A must-visit location in Seoul, portraying Korean architecture and culture. Try wearing hanbok (Korean traditional dress) while visiting the palace."
416,5.0,This is a fabulous place for anyone and everyone to explore Korea history. From the palace walls to the museum inside you definitely get a sense of what the old days were like and beauty that Korea has Architect wise. The price to enter is such a small amount $3 USD or free if you rent a hanbok- which I highly recommended for memorable pictures.
417,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is an amazing experience and worth the visit when in Seoul! Step back into time more than 600 years to walk these grounds and take in all the history that makes this palace a “MUST VISIT”.! The grounds are vast with countless buildings, gates and walls to wonder around and take in all the aspects of Korean history and culture! Make sure you give yourself at least a couple hours for this one; it is spread out with lots to take in.  Highly recommend.!!"
418,5.0,"Its a nice places to learn about the culture. You can try to use hanbok and the clothes are very pretty. Many foreigners as well as local use that during the visit.  They have guard shift ceremony every 10 am and 2 pm, make sure not to miss this ceremony. The palace environment felt once you arrive the gyeongbokgung subway."
419,5.0,"Wow. Visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace was the highlight on this one day tour. We felt as if we were transported back in time, by just walking through the Palace gate. It felt surreal for me. Seeing the size of the property and the designs certainly added to the mystique of the surroundings. The changing of the guards reminds me of British Palace tours, only more colorful and artsy. Added to the attraction were the visitors of all ages wearing rented traditional garbs. Amazingly awesome place to visit. We spent an hour here including visit to the National Folk museum situated on the same grounds. A must see when you go."
420,5.0,"We went in the morning with an organized tour group and we loved it. Admittedly, it always helps to have good weather and a clear, blue sky but the Palace grounds are very large and beautiful with plenty of different things to see. We also attended the Changing of the Guard ceremony which I would really recommend. I'd also recommend going with a tour guide because otherwise you'll be walking through the grounds not knowing what you see and you could get lost in this ""labyrinth"" and hence maybe miss some important buildings and stories. From the limited things I've seen in Seoul (it was a joint business/family 2-day trip), this was the highlight."
421,4.0,"Very good morning touring around the Palace and surrounding buildings. Extensive grounds to walk around with many buildings. Most enjoyable was the changing of the guard at 10am and 2pm, also watching all the people dressed up in traditional clothing taking pictures."
422,3.0,"This Palace also houses the Korean National Palace Museum and the National Folk Museum. Because it was the biggest remaining Korean palace , the whole complex was systematically destroyed during the Japanese Occupation at the beginning of the 20th Century, and is slowly being rebuilt , including demolition of former Japanese government buildings to recreate the majestic Palace gateways! So everything you see today is very recent."
423,4.0,"It was built prior to Forbidden City of China, but a bit smaller and maybe a bit simpler?  Overall, enjoyed the changes of guard, even though they were all actors.  As the biggest of the 5 palaces in Seoul, it is still a must to do list, but may not need to visit the other palaces after this one."
424,5.0,"Free English and Korean tours available, usually 1.5 hour long. Three times a day, last is at 330pm or so. This was on a Sunday for us. I recommend the tour guides bc it makes seeing the building and at different aspects more enjoyable and knowing their history is a plus.  Admission is 3000 won/ adult. Credit card accepted. You can rent traditional clothing and get free admission, rental rates is cheaper as you get further from the palace. Usually 10000 won nearby the palace. Folk museum is right next door and free admission."
425,5.0,This place is a must visit to all visitors! You must rent Hanbok and take picture in the palace. Great view and great picture.
426,4.0,"Less opulent than the Forbidden City in Beijing, but more trees, flowers, and greenery. Lovely to walk around and see people in hanbok (beautifully crafted traditional clothing)."
427,5.0,"Beautiful place, definitely a place to visit with family, we got to know and understood a lot of the wonderful Korean culture."
428,4.0,"Simply a must see in Korea. Even if most of it has been rebuilt as it was mostly destroyed by Japs and Korean War after that, it is now in good condition. Large park, beautiful architecture, what are you waiting for?!"
429,4.0,Getting into the Gyeongbokgung Palace brings you back to the ancient scenes of Korea and makes you understand more their culture and history.
430,4.0,"It was an interesting place. The palace is a large area with different buildings and gardens. By the entrance gate it was very crowded but the more you walk inside, the less people there is. Alot of people are dressed in the traditional clothes, so it was very interesting. It felt like a movie set or a scene from the past. The buildings were simple with colored wood decorations."
431,5.0,"I went by myself via the subway, which was very safe and interesting. The palace a short walk from the stop. I timed my arrival with the changing of the guard. I spent 2-3 hours here, wandering about and taking photos. The numerous costumed guests afforded me great shots as they posed, ran, or peaked out. The entry fee was reasonable. I'm happy tourists are allowed to view the grounds.  Afterwards, I walked around the area and saw a huge protest at Gwanghwamun Square, which is a gathering place in front of the palace. I was told there something going on there almost daily. A further bit down the road and I ran into a Starbucks and then on to the tourist information center, where they were very helpful. I need an SD card for my phone and they called the nearby bookstore and inquired if they did indeed sell the cards as I had been told. I then walked across the street, to the bookstore, and discovered that it is nothing like I would know in the USA. They sell all manner of things inside that store. It was very interesting there too. This area is a must-see!"
432,5.0,"Amazing place to visit. We did this as part eof our Seoul full day tour, so our guide explained alot. We arrived right as the changing of the guard ceremony was beginning. Plenty to see and learn."
433,4.0,Interesting visit to the palace. Lots of other tourists in rented Hanboks to make the place more fun to visit.  It would have been better with more signage to share more about the different areas of the palace and its history.  Else it’s a nice stroll that takes about 2-3 hours. Nice shopping and food surrounding the palace too.
434,5.0,This historical place gives wonderful Korean experience. Lot of people wear Korean dress ( that gives free entry) and walk around. Many of photo sports. One can take free guided tours on specific times. A must see place if you visit Seoul.
435,5.0,"We joined the free English tour, which was really excellent, informative and entertaining. If you come in traditional costume, the entrance fee is waived, but it was summer, so our hosts opted for the cooler choice of paying for the tickets. We were thankful!! Plenty of photo opps, beautiful grounds and buildings, fascinating history."
436,5.0,If you are visiting seoul this is one of the places that it must be in your list to visit.  Recommend to rent a hanok to wear which is the triditional korean custom and if you dress it you get a free entrace to the palace.  The entrace for an adult cost 3000 KRW. Hanok custom rental for 2 hrs cost around 14000- 18000 KRW. Could be cheaper as a just visited on shop so cant compare prices with other.
437,4.0,Royal Guard Changing Ceremony at Gyeongbokgung Palace was very interesting. Royal guard ware traditional cloth. Please check schedule for this ceremony!!
438,5.0,"lovely palace with beautiful agrdens and ponds. great photo opprtunities. Dress up in traditional clothes (Hambok) for that special pic and feel, also for free entry in to the palace grounds."
439,4.0,One of the landmarks for Seoul and suitable to visit on a weekend. The place is colourful. Many people are dressed in traditional costumes. The trip can be completed by a visit to the nearby village. I recommend it for anyone interested to immerse himself in the past era of Korea.
440,5.0,"One of the biggest palaces in terms of walking and things to see. Bit of a health and safety hazard, so watch young children as falls are signposted but there are few barriers. Pro of this, is better pictures without black and yellow health and safety tape on all edges. It's a little maze, and there's many complexes to see.  Grab a free map from the entrance and tick off places as you visit, Look out for Korean's wearing traditional clothes and having photo shoots in the grounds.  Easily could spend a full day here.  Get it as part of the Royal Palace pass to get a discount - pass is valid for 3 months from purchase date."
441,4.0,"This is a huge palace compound. A clear fine product of the Korean Dynasty. There are a few gates and halls with distinctive architects for perfect photo. Even so when one dress in the traditional Hanbok. While the inner compound is stone paved and very bare, there is an outer area of greenery. This is the part we enjoyed most. Old trees, green grass, big pond with the willow trees which contrasted the inner court. Really enjoy the stroll and relax atmosphere. Another perfect spots for photos."
442,4.0,"Unfortunately we forgot to visit at the back side of the palace. 😭😭 Wear hanbok for free entrance. Hanbok rental is from 12,00/hour 18,00/4hour The shop just across the road from side gate of gyeongbukgung. There are many hanbok rental shop around there."
443,5.0,Cheap entrance ticket or free when you enter wearing with traditional Korean “Hanbok” which can be rented in many shops in Bukchon village.  Nice well preserved palaces and beautiful lake.
444,5.0,"Into every lengthy vacation this side of the Gobi, some rain must fall. My luck finally ran out on my last day in Seoul, with a thunderstorm intense enough to put Noah’s 40 days to shame. Nevertheless, I was determined to see one specific ghost-ridden spot within Gyeongbokgung, of world-wide historical importance, rain or no.  Pelting rain at the vast complex in August does keep you cool. Distant rain-shrouded mountains turn grey and misty, like an ink painting come to life (see Heungnyemun and Geunjeongleon photos). Gyeonghoeru Pavilion’s roof blends with its rain-swept lake, and its red eaves and balconies take on an (appropriately for me) sombre tone (see Gyeonghoeru Pavilion and Gyeonghoeru Eaves photos). And the colourful interiors of the Geunjeongleon Throne Room and Sajeongjeon’s Hall of Worthies are bright by comparison (see Throne Hall and Hall of Worthies photos). At Gyeongbokgung, these are a thunderstorm’s sole virtues.  I worried that the rain would scare away all the Hanbok Belles, one of the aesthetic joys of visiting any Korean palace. But the downpour didn’t deter the Belles from strutting their stuff in the national dress. Their attitude seemed to be “Rain, fiddlesticks! We’ve never met the rainstorm yet that could whip our hoop skirts!” (See Hanbok 1, Hanbok 2 and Hanbok 3 photos).  And tears from Heaven were appropriate given my reason for being there. I was headed to the back of Gyeongbokgung, as far from the entrance and the crowds as you can go, to see Geoncheonggung Palace. A barbaric event occurred there: the sadistic butchering of Queen Min: usually called an “assassination” though that word doesn’t begin to capture the horror of the actual event. That crime on October 8th, 1895 started a half-century reign of terror, with consequences still hanging over us.  Following the Meiji Restoration, Japanese nationalism generated militarism and a policy of foreign expansion. Expansion generally means war, but does not necessarily mean systematic and sadistic barbarity. For all World War I’s horrors, the French, British and Germans on the Western Front neither tortured prisoners of war nor systematically gang-raped their enemies’ young women. For years the Austro-Hungarian and Italian armies on the Isonzo Front scrupulously abided by the Hague Conventions. Even the first chess-move in Japan’s drive to expand, against China in 1894, was a relatively gentlemanly naval affair, though one-sided. Japan got Formosa, but the Western powers blocked them from getting the mainland Chinese territory they’d demanded. So Japan turned back to another target they’d long been eyeing: Korea.  Korea’s timorous emperor could easily be coerced. Japan’s problem was that Empress Myeongseong, “Queen Min”, could not be. To counter Japanese instructors of Korean militia, Queen Min brought in military instructors from the USA. Queen Min strengthened relations with Tsarist Russia, Korea’s northern neighbour, as a counter to Japan. Queen Min even got the Chinese Customs Service extended into Korea. That internationally-run service honestly collected customs revenues and delivered those revenues to Peking, and now to Seoul as well, thus strengthening foreign relations, and funding military improvements.  Tokyo had been within an ace of making Korea a Japanese puppet. Now Korea was fast slipping out of their fingers, all due to Queen Min, particularly when she ordered the disbanding of that Japanese-trained militia. Viscount Miura, one of Japan’s most senior statesmen, was dispatched to Korea to remedy this. Miura decided to make Korea’s emperor “an offer he couldn’t refuse.”  In the middle of the night, on October 8th, 1895, Japan staged a military-style assault on the Geoncheonggung Palace. The attackers included some pro-Japan Korean traitors, but the hard core of the assault were 60 or so Japanese. The palace guards were overwhelmed and massacred. Miura’s Japanese agents caught up with Queen Min and her maids of honour as they were trying to escape through a patio. First Queen Min was repeatedly raped; then she was hacked with swords, and finally she was burned along with her maids of honour, possibly while some of them were still alive.  The king fled in terror to the Russian legation, where he was given sanctuary. It was obvious that Miura had ordered the barbarism, and the whole world was outraged, including Japan’s powerful ally, Great Britain. Due to that, the Japanese government was compelled to put Miura on trial for the crime. Perhaps if they’d hung him, the hard-line faction in Tokyo would have been cowed. We’ll never know, because the trial was as outrageous as the crime. Miura freely admitted that he had ordered the crime. His defence attorney argued that Miura should be acquitted on the grounds that no act done in the national interest of Japan, no matter how grisly, could ever be criminal. The Japanese court then found Miura innocent on grounds of insufficient evidence! Miura was hailed and honoured as a national hero. What more encouragement could Japan’s most ruthless factions have gotten?  The Japanese are NOT a nation of sadistic thugs; just as Germans, Spaniards and Turks aren’t, despite Auschwitz, the Inquisition, and the Armenian massacres. But in all these countries, for a while, the worst elements were in control. During the half-century after Queen Min’s assassination, there was always an opposition to the direction that Japan was headed. What Queen Min’s assassination and Miura’s acquittal did, was to terrifically boost the power and arrogance of the extremists. Over those next 50 years, even respected senior Japanese statesmen would be assassinated with impunity by them.  A dark path was taken; it started here. It led to the the 300,000 victims of the Rape of Nanking, to the slaughter at Singapore’s Alexandria Hospital, the Bataan Death March, the horrors committed in Intramuros, the victims—perhaps hundreds of thousands of them—of Unit 731’s biological warfare testing; and the hundreds of thousands of sex slaves whose lives were destroyed: 80% of these “comfort women” were Korean. Jaoan’s path led to a 50-year road, then highway, then super-highway of ever-increasing horror, which was only stopped by the counter-horror of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Over the 50 years that Japan ruled Korea, the Japanese diligently demolished places that might evoke Korean nationalism. Most of Gyeongbokgung Palace wound up being knocked down, and needless to say, Queen Min’s palace was one of the first to go. Korea has worked slowly and steadily at rebuilding exact replicas of the heritage that its enemies demolished, including Geoncheonggung Palace. If you go there, I was assured that what you see is identical with what stood there on that night. And you really are standing on hallowed ground.  You can go to lots of other assassination sites: Ghandi Smriti, the Church of the Savior on Blood, Dealey Plaza, even the spot in the Theatre of Pompey where Julius Caesar was done in by Brutus. But if I am correct that the assassination of Queen Min lit a fuse igniting 50 years of horrors in Asia, and leading ultimately to the Damocles sword of intercontinental nuclear war that now hangs over all of us, then I can think of only one other assassination spot on Earth that matches this one for historic significance: the memorial plaque just off the Latin Bridge in Sarajevo, where Franz Ferdinand and Sophie were killed."
445,5.0,"I really fell in love with Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's a big palace that shows the greatness of old Korean Kingdom. It's very easy see locals dressing in national costume: that's make the atmosphere even more magical. We also saw the changing of guard ceremony. Entrance ticket is cheap, only 3.000 won each."
446,5.0,It's really interesting for visit the palace of the country we visit. This palace is the main one with beautiful views.
447,5.0,The palace grounds are very big and although there are lots of ppl around you can find a spot to take pics.
448,5.0,Top attraction in Seoul. Get there by 10:00am to see the changing of the guard. Stand in front of the ticket booth for the best views so you see them coming in the gate.
449,5.0,"Even though this is all reconstruction, it's a pleasant view into the past. As most of Korea was devastated by war, we were thrilled that this complex has been recreated. On the day of our visit, a Sunday, we were treated to scores of folks in traditional Korea dress which only added greatly to the charm. We spent approximately two hours strolling through the grounds and enjoyed it immensely. It was well worth the visit!"
450,3.0,"The palace is spread out over a large area and be prepared to do alot of walking. The map in English may not be accurate in identifying the different structures. For those who are conversant with Chinese characters, it's probably good to have the map with Chinese too as most of the structures have Chinese character names. The change of guard ceremony is interesting but not a must watch if you're short of time. Not allowed to enter most of the structures, can only view from outside. After a few of them, they all looked similar."
451,4.0,"The palace is quite lovely. I took the train to Gyeongbokgung station and walked to the exit marked with ‘palace’, super easy to get too, two trains from Seoul Station. I walked around the palace grounds visiting the large number of buildings. The grounds were beautiful, I highly recommend this palace."
452,5.0,This is one of the sites within Seoul that you actually get a sense what the early Korean architecture and culture would have been like in the 1400s and later. Much of the country was later destroyed in various wars. It is very photogenic as many locals rent historical costumes to wear while they visit the palace. The palace covers a large area and you should count on at least an hour to walk and explore the grounds.
453,5.0,- A must visit palace - entrance fee for foreigners is 3000 won - seniors more than 65 years old enter free - Free guided tours in 4 languages between 1000-1600 hours - 2 types of Guard Changing Ceremonies  a. Changing of palace guard ceremony - held in square inside Gwanghwamun gate - 10am and 2pm - free to enter this area without palace ticket  B. Gate Guard duty performance - outside Gwanghwamun gate on road side - 11am and 1pm
454,5.0,"Feel the greatness when Korea was a great kingdom a long time ago. There are many sites in here to walk and a very wide area. The ticket is 3,000 KRW (2019) for one person or you can visit several palaces (not only Gyeongbokgung) with another type of tickets. Don't forget to go to Tosokchon to taste the original Samgyetang (Ginseng Chicken Soup) in the left side of this palace, or Bukchon Hanok Village in the right side."
455,5.0,"We were fortunate that the palace was free to enter on the day we went, however, even if you have to pay, it's the best palace in the city.  It's also charming to see locals, especially youngsters dressing in national costume to get the best pictures for their Instagram account.  There are a couple of cafes in the grounds and also at the museum towards the back if you need a break."
456,5.0,They provide a guide and transportation. Very enjoyable tour. Guide spoke excellent English and ver knowledgeable.
457,3.0,"It was good to know the history of the biggest palace of Korean history. Pack of people taking pictures with hanbok in the front area, but if you walk more inside the complex area, there are less crowded place."
458,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is a lovely place to visit and take photos, especially if you rent Hanbok (traditional Korean outfits). It doesn't cost much to visit, maybe 3000 won, but if you rent Hanbok you can get in for free and take awesome photos."
459,5.0,"It is the biggest palace as I know in Seoul. It is better to enjoy during the spring or fall, but it has it’s own beauty every season. So don’t hesitate to visit this palace! :)"
460,5.0,A really great day out with English speaking tours! There was so much to see and learn about and we were lucky enough to visit whilst a guard ceremony was taking place.
461,4.0,"Easily accessible in Seoul, gorgeous Palace, cheap to get in, look for traditional events on evening."
462,5.0,It was a bit rainy when we came but don't let that put you off if you're prepared. There's a lot of buildings to walk around and see. There's also a Cafe and gift shop if you want to stop and rest a bit
463,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is the grandest of Seoul's 5 royal palaces. It has had several uses through time but is now a major tourist attraction. The Royal Palace pass works here, the entrance fee is 3000KW. The Gyeonghoeru Pavilion is only visitable by pre-booking online, this is free. The guided tour is in Korean only."
464,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is somewhat like the Forbidden City - smaller, but laid out as a series of inner squares with temples. (Also, less built up, less crowded and generally more accessible.) Watching the changing of the guard is an especially nice time/way to visit!"
465,3.0,Free as it is Korea National Day this week. Nice corridors to take photos but bad for a hot day. You will see lots of tourists dressed in traditional clothing  However today It is scorching no shelter or shade to cool.  Plan well before entering on hot day.
466,5.0,"Dreaded going to this place as Im not a fan of historical sites but this was so different and a lot of fun! It was a pleasant surprise. Firstly, we rented hanboks from one of the many hanbok rental shops (10,000 won for 2 hours) really near the palace, it was fun choosing and coordinating the colours. And then we got to enter the palace for free because of our hanbok attire. It was a great experience to see this historical landmark and wear traditional korean clothes! Totally brought us back in time and felt so in character. P.s: It was in summer and wearing the hanboks made us feel warmer than ideal. Haha."
467,5.0,This palace is the largest of all five palaces famous in Seoul. The beauty is mesmerizing. There is a small restaurant also that serves basic food along with some souvenirs. It will take around two hours to visit the place. The entry is not free here so ready to pay an amount that you won't regret later. A must visit place.
468,5.0,"A fascinating palace complex which was the main palace of the longstanding Joseon Dynasty. It is preferable to visit with a tour guide who can provide background both on the history of the dynasty and the significance of the buildings. Its grounds also house the National PalaceMuseum and the National Folk Museum, both of which are worth visiting."
469,5.0,"The entire palace grounds is huge as it houses 2 museums and numerous restored buildings within. The complimentary guided tour was quite informative and interesting. There are still many buildings yet to be restored and the government has been making good effort into the restoration of this palace back to its glory. It would be interesting to go again when there are more buildings. The two museums within its grounds are free to enter. The Royal Palace Museum is definitely a must if you would like to catch a glimpse into the past and the lives of those who used to live in Gyeongbukgung. This palace along with Changdeokgung, Changyeonggung, Deoksugung, the Secret Garden and Jongmyo Shrine are included in the Royal Palace Pass at 10,000 won. Really good deal."
470,5.0,"Located in the center of Seoul, conveniently accessible by subway. A lot of people, local girls in national costumes. On the territory there is a museum of royal life. If you go to the end of the complex, you can go to the presidential palace. Also, there is an art crafts museum nearby, very interesting!"
471,4.0,"Most iconic symbol of all of Korea. The largest and most scenic of all the Palace with Mount Bugaksan in the background. Changing of the Guard Ceremony is a must: 1000 and 1300. Entry Fee is 3,000 won. Close every Tuesday. You can reach Gyeongbokgung Palace by taking Subway Line 3 to Gyeongbokgung Station Exit 3."
472,5.0,If you love history and going back in time this is a place you must see. You can even dress up in the clothes they did.
473,4.0,"This is a very interesting place, but if you don't like walking a lot, it is a place to avoid! The stones you mostly walk on are uneven and it can be very tiring and hard on the legs and feet."
474,5.0,"if you wear a hanbok, you get in free! there were many, many people wearing gorgous hanboks with their sig others graciously taking pics of them. great photo op with you in the traditional dress of korea. it's a very large area to walk around so never felt crowded even though there was quite a crowd there on a warm summer afternoon. exiting is difficult however we did find another one toward the history museum/hanok areas."
475,3.0,"We went and it was pretty cool to see, but seemed to be missing something. One thing we noticed pretty quick was most places were closed and you could only see the outside of the buildings.  If you have been to The Forbidden City, this can be a disappointment."
476,5.0,"No exaggeration, you could easily spend 4-5 hours roaming the palace grounds. It's absolutely massive and full of things to explore. Great photo ops all over as well. Normally there's an entrance fee, but I went last week and didn't have to pay anything. One thing to note, when they say it closes at 6, they mean your butt better be out by 6. Those guards do not play at all, lol."
477,5.0,"This was the very first place we wanted to visit when coming to Seoul. We took the opportunity to rent traditional hanboks in one of the numerous shops longing the palace, so the entrance was free (if you don't rent one, then you must pay the entrance ticket). A walk in the palace took us a good two hours, it is even bigger than we thought when looking at it from outside. It feels quite magical when you're interested in Korean culture, even more when lots of visitors are wearing hanboks themselves. There are a lot of spots to take pictures, sometimes you might meet Korean people asking to take a picture with you!  You cannot go inside the palace though, you can check what's inside from the windows. But it was overall a really good visit and we felt really involved thanks to the outfits. I recommend renting a hanbok to visit, it doesn't feel the same than when you wear your own clothes!"
478,5.0,"Must see in Seoul. Picturesque architecture, interesting history, It's worth seeing a change of guard. I recommend to come early, right after opening - this way you can avoid long queues that appear later."
479,3.0,It was very pretty but the vibe I got was very touristy so I could not really enjoy it. There wasn't much more than eggshell buildings you could take pictures in.
480,3.0,Beautiful place and big complex. I visited the place with my parents and it is difficult to find toilets around
481,5.0,A beautiful palace to visit - not as busy in the morning so I recommend going as early as you can when there are no ticket queues. We got there by about 10:30-10:45am and left by 12 and it was heaving - long queues. Lovely to see people walking around dressed in traditional outfits that they had rented. The areas surrounded by water are the most beautiful to see.
482,4.0,Loved visiting this palace and it’s extensive grounds! Would be lovely to visit when weather is a little cooler as it is all outdoors. So historic and loved seeing people dressed in traditional clothing (hanbok).
483,4.0,If you dress traditional you don’t need to pay the entry. You can rent a dress in houses next to the palace. And have a photo shoot. Really great! 50% is dressed like that. With makes it like you are in history....flash back.
484,5.0,"I love history and it was amazing to visit the grand and amazing Gyeongbokgung Palace. Experience the changing of the guard ceremonies at the main entrance Gwanghwamun, the museums, ornamental gardens and some of Seoul's grandest architectural sights. Rent a Hanbook and besides getting free admission into the grounds with it, look good in your pics with the traditional Korean costume. Lots of culture and beauty in store here, like Gyotaejeon Hall and Amisan Garden, Gyeonghoeru Pavilion, Hyangwonjeong Pavilion, Sinmumun Gate, etc. Wear comfortable shoes for walking ....."
485,4.0,"This historical palace is not to be missed when you are in Korea. We enjoyed walking in the grounds of the palace in our hanbok. You can sense the grandeur of the place during its time. Also, we were lucky enough to witness the changing of the guards ceremony."
486,5.0,This is a very important place for Korean History. It was an honor to review the palace and see where the Old School Kings lived.
487,4.0,"This place is huge. Many temples to see and the museums are included with the price. A lot of walking. Also got to see the changing of the guard, it is done twice a day. First one was at 10:00 am."
488,4.0,To me it was more of a giant park than a historical palace visit. It is very large and so if you are wanting more than a beautiful peaceful walk I recommend going during one of the times with a tour guide.
489,4.0,"Beautiful gardens. Tour guides are very helpful and speak perfect English. It would have been a little easier to not wander in circles if the buildings and roads were better labeled. The grounds itself are really big, so make sure to wear walking shoes! If it's not too hot, go hire the hanbok costumes and experience the palace the way Korean royals would have in the Joseon era."
490,5.0,This huge palace is a must see while in Seoul. Its got so much to see and is right in the middle of the city. Lots of people were dressed up in traditional korean attire. Great place for pictures and scenery or just for a nice long walk.
491,5.0,A history of Korean empire with. Beautiful architecture and surrounded by beautiful greenery.the cafeteria sitting place is very cute with wooden huts.
492,5.0,Worth a trip to see this attraction. Just check opening hours. We arrived at 6.30 and it was closed so had to waiting until it re opened at 7pm. Also the late opening did not allow entry to the two Koreans I was with. After 7pm is for foreign visitors and older Koreans so we found out on the day.
493,3.0,"A national treasure, but if you only visit one palace in Seoul, choose Changdeokgung Palace instead (I've left a review there, too). Gyeongokgung is gigantic, but in its current state feels empty. Actually, the museums inside were more interesting than the grounds themselves."
494,5.0,Traditional custume.can rent and wear it.. Creat special moment..it's royal and tradition of Korea. History of Korea
495,5.0,Instagramable view and different area to post even their trees are amazing like from the jungle also good for photo ops
496,4.0,"This palace is huge. The buildings are lovely. Not much to see inside them. Very cool though. Plan several hours if you want to see everything. The changing of the guards is something I only saw at this palace and was nice to see. Crowded toward the front, but far fewer people toward the back. Good view of the ""blue palace"" from the back gate. Gwanghwamun on the purple line is the subway stop I used."
497,5.0,An Amazing Palace. You must see the guard change ans the Big garden. If you want all things to see you need a lot of time
498,5.0,"Such a serene and beautiful palace set amongst the skyscrapers of Seoul. Must visit! Buy tickets online so you don’t ha e to wait in line. There are free tours in English but read the website to coordinate your visit during the times available. Very hot day, so we didn’t rent to wear any of the beautiful costumes. However I heard that if you do wear one, entrance is free. We truly appreciated those who braved the heat and donned costumes as it made our photos even more beautiful and colourful."
499,5.0,"Make sure you find an offline map at the gate.  It was a hot sunny day, and we travelled with a baby. The place was stroller friendly. Some of the areas were under constructions, including the famous small lake. But nonetheless, we managed to cover most of the areas and found many cheap and good quality souvenirs at the shop (make sure to try their drinks as well!). We got cute bookmarks, notes, even jewelries.  Overall, it was a good place where you can have a leisurely stroll (even better if it's not too hot)."
500,4.0,"A hug palace with historical architecture. If you want to explore this place, you should spend all day, its really big."
501,4.0,"Renting hanbok costumes - traditional Korean dress - gives one free entry.  Otherwise, the price is a most reasonable KRW3000 per person.\  We visited on a weekday. It rained for 15 minutes but thankfully stopped.\  The grounds are extensive and changing of the guard beautifully done. One can pose beside these individuals."
502,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung palace was an amazing experience!!! To be submerged in korea's rich history and its tradition, i got to see alot of colorful hanboks(traditional korean clothing) and the amazing architecture surrounding the palace, the palace is huge, with alot of greeny and seats available for it's visitors, there are also bathroom facilities around the palace, although refrain from smoking! The palace also holds a Musuem, and in it a café and some gifts shops,you can also find an area of a very old 80's-town almost as if it got frozen in time, there are so many Hotspots to take selfies and photos so sometimes it can be over crowded but nonetheless the scenery is absolutely beautiful and to be in the presence of the palace was magical!!!! I felt i was reliving history"
503,5.0,"Largest palace, entry free of 3000 won, free if wearing hanbok, must visit and have look at the grandeur, very beautifully maintained. Recommend joining a free tour for a very informative tour around the palace, can enter the palace museum and folk museum for free."
504,4.0,"The place was beautiful and historic. We saw a guard changing ceremony and it was amazing 👍🏻 . There was a hanbok renting, but we decided that it was a too hot weather to rent a hanbok, so we rent a hanbok in Bukchon Hanok Village (see review of Bukchon Hanok Village). We took some beautiful pictures. Overall it was beautiful and historic."
505,5.0,"Best place ever, it’s truly amazing. Some parts of it was under construcrion. Be aware that for the pavilon, you have to book tickets a day before. The entrance fee is unrealisticaly cheap. The avarage time what tourists spend there, is 3-3,5hour"
506,5.0,We joined one of the free English tour and the guide did a great job at summarizing the main points and explaining historical facts for people without knowledge of Korea history. The Palace itself is beautiful and the crowds of people/tourists dress in hanbok (traditional costumes) give it an additional charm.
507,5.0,This is a gorgeous Palace in downtown Seoul. Most of it has been rebuilt but it is historically accurate. Many people rent traditional clothes just outside the gate and then get in free to see the palace. We did not dress up as June in Korea is so hot. The palace itself is lovely to look at and you need about two hours to see it. Unfortunately you can't go inside any of the buildings; if you could it would really enhance the experience.
508,5.0,"I loved the place worth the visit, wearing the costume and taking photos it makes great memory pictures plus you can do the tour alone after doing some walk from the city"
509,4.0,Love that it’s in the middle of city. Outside the walls is modern Korea. We were able to witness the exchange guards which was on Monday morning. Entrance is free if you wear traditional clothing which you can rent nearby stores.
510,3.0,Good place to walk around. Interesting to see everyone in national dress. (Not sure about the foreigners doing it as well though). Can be crowded.
511,4.0,So we had to walk and walk and see where the women lived and where the king lived and where the conjugated. Sorry not my cup of tea.
512,5.0,This was built 500 years ago and some parts were burnt during Japan invade Chosun dynasty. It was restored and open to public. This palace is surrounded by mountain. Compare to Jaguemsung In China it seems small but this is more delicated. You can feel historic area among mordern Seoul. Nearby this palace you can reach many historic places around Jongro.
513,5.0,"Thoroughly enjoyed walking through this palace and grounds. Opted to get dressed up in hanboks with my Korean friend and we were allowed free entry to the palace, which felt like a nice touch for tourists already spending money renting hanboks. The colours inside the buildings are mesmerising and my friend told us they were part of the decor to ward off evil energy or spirits, as well as the mythical creatures and sculptures at the end of the roofs. Very beautiful. Be sure to catch the guard changing ceremony as well, narrated via speakerphone in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese."
514,5.0,"During our stay in Seoul we went to visit this palace twice. The changing of the guards is wonderful with the instruments, precision and clothes. We enjoyed learning about the history of the kings of South Korea."
515,5.0,"I don't know where to start on reviewing this astonishingly beautiful palace except to say it us utterly beguiling and unmissable. It's so big and there is so much to see, different parts deserve their own listings to be honest! The highlight for me was the Gyeongheru Pavilion, just beautiful as its surrounded by a gorgeous lake. Its lovely to sit there and relax. Close second, and most people's favourite I'd say, is the majestic Geunjeongjon Hall which is the throne hall. The intricacy and colours are just mesmeric The King and Queens living quarters are lovely too and there is just so many lovely colourful and intricately decorated buildings around, not to mention scenic grounds. The row of chimneys in the Amisan Gardens to the rear of the queens consorts residence are interesting as they were vents for the underfloor heating! Anyway, give several hours, most of a day over to explore this magnificent palace complex. 5 stars just doesn't seem enough to give."
516,4.0,As I was travelling for business I did not have much time to sight see. My colleague took me to the palace to breathe in some Korean heritage. It was a lovely experience and I learned a lot about Korean history in a short (1 hour) time. Glad I didn't miss out!
517,4.0,"We went on a Thursday morning in May and it was not too crowded. This is the largest of the Seoul palaces and there is much to see in this restored palace compound. The changing of the guard ceremony is in the area where the tickets are sold and happens at 10:00 and 2:00. It is quite colorful and is more than just a changing of the guard. Inside the grounds is the National Folk Museum and it is included with the palace admission. It also is a large space and we only got half way through. One could really spend a lot of time in this palace area. For us, a half day was enough but it was quite nice."
518,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is more like a Chinese ancient palace with beautiful scenary. If you go visit this place, you must go rent a Hanbok (Korean traditional costumes) first. With the Hanbok, you will have free admission to Gyeongbokgung Palace. There are many beautiful spots for taking nice photos at the Palace with Hanbok."
519,5.0,"If you are a first time visitor to Seoul, this place is a must. Rent a hanbok (traditional Korean outfit) from nearby venders around the palace and be a Korean for a day. I personally think everyone looks good in hanbok. There are free English tour of the palace and it is well worth your time if you want to get a glimpse of Korean history, politics and culture.  Don’t miss the changing of the guards ceremony and this place have very festive and positive vibe."
520,4.0,"Regardless of the crowd, I still can feel the traditional vibe of ghost of its past. I thank anyone who were wearing hanbok(s) [The traditional Korean attire]. The palace was just okay though but the pillars were still in good structure and gives me the chance to enjoy the scene where the girls in hanbok are just so suited with the palace's pillars, just like what I always see in the historical Korean drama. Apart from that, the change of guard is also a must watch and it is pretty colourful."
521,5.0,"this wasnt busy when we went,. Noon on a weekday. The palace is largr than life. So beautiful and people are dressed in their authentic korean wear (free entry if you have th dress code). But we paid some 3000 KRW to enter. spent about and 1 hr taking some pictures. amazing experience"
522,5.0,What else should be explained? All tourists must go to this place if they visit Seoul for the first time. Do not miss 'Changing of the Royal Guard' ceremony when you visit here.
523,5.0,"This is a very beautiful palace, easy to stroll around, with many people dressed in traditional clothes adding to the charm of our photos. The changing of the guard is very simply done but with great honor and punctuality. Sadly, the tourists are all over the place and hardly notice this important tradition, but I am very pleased to have witnessed it. My only wish is that each building have a sign, in English (and other languages) to describe it's purpose. That would be a very useful addition."
524,4.0,"Was amazing entrance to the palace, the change of guards took place just inside the gate. Inside the palace ground, are the National Palace Musuemof Korea and the National Folk Musuem. There many interesting and architectural parts of the palace for their different usage. Within walking distance to the other 3 palaces. Amazing mountain back drop frame the Gyeongbokgung .Palace. Was extremely busy on weekends, avoid it if possible."
525,4.0,"Built in 1395, Gyeongbokgung is the largest and most important royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. It was a good experience to take in all the history and architecture of the buildings that comprise the palace grounds. We rented traditional Hanbok at a nearby store for a more Korean historical experience. We were pleasantly surprised to learn that entrance to the palace is free if you wear Hanbok. Many spots within the palace grounds are Instagram worthy."
526,5.0,This place is beautiful with all iconic ancient Korean architecture. You can take tons of photos in every corner. You can enter free if you wear Hanbok
527,5.0,"A nice walk amongst the buildings of the main Seoul palace. The main problems that I faced while in Seoul are the following : A) if you have been in one palace, then they all look alike, B) they are not the actual buildings they have been restored or completely built from scratch. Still the amount of work and maintenance is astonishing. Also nice if you are there to watch the guards change which is also explained in English. Quite huge walk and might have helped taking the English tour which is available free thrice a day. But on the other hand, not sure if I could have stayed with the tour for the whole 20+ buildings. If you are going in the palace on a sunny summer day of Seoul, do make sure to have a fan (hand fan, battery fan, etc) and some shade provider (hat, umbrella, etc)."
528,5.0,"So serene and beautiful. Tons of foreigners wearing rented hanbok were fun made the dusty grounds very colorful and complimented the gorgeous buildings. Wonderful history lesson. The folk museum is right next door, too. Also well worth it."
529,4.0,"We went to the palace during a long layover in Korea. I was initially hesitant as I was hoping for some shopping instead but ultimately I really enjoyed the visit. For US tourist, I would not even think of going here without a local guide. We saw many tourist trying to listen to our guide as they had no idea what they were looking at. Worth the trip . . ."
530,5.0,"If you only have time to visit one palace, I recommend this one. It is the largest of the 5 palaces and most impressive. Expect this palace you be crowded. Many female visitors are wearing the traditional dresses, which are great for photo shoots. Palace compound is huge, with many halls, rooms, quarters, pavilions etc. I spent about 1.5 hours exploring this compound.  Time yourself to witness the changing of royal guards ceremony daily at 1000hr and 1400hr. Ceremony is held at the public square in front of the palace entrance. Hence, you can even watch this ceremony without purchasing the palace entrance ticket. If time permits, you can also visit the 2 nearby museums which are free admission, ie National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum."
531,4.0,"We went in for free because we were wearing hanbok. The palaces were well preserved. We did not find the main palace though, maybe because of the ongoing constructions. And the hanbok was a bit hot so we just left after we took some pictures. I am definitely going back there on colder days."
532,5.0,"It was close to 20 years since I visited the palace for the first time and the government has done a great job in continually restoring the structures and grounds that originally were part of the expansive palace. Knowing this would be the most popular palace to visit, we avoided some of the expected crowds by arriving at the opening. Adults were 3000Won while our teens were 1500Won.  The main buildings that were most interesting to us were:  Geunjeongjeon - Large, elevated hall where the king greeted his subjects or guests. Visible from the outside was his throne and ornately painted ceiling and beams. This was the first building seen and most popular with the visiting crowds.  Gyotaejeon - This was the queen's quarters but the garden in the back with chimneys was more interesting. While not currently landscaped, I could see how it would have been a scenic getaway for the queen from the rather plain palace grounds.  Gyeonghoeru - The royal banquet hall was a two story building supported on massive stone columns was but only visible from across the pond. This was a popular backdrop for many tourists photos that day.  More buildings that what I originally remember went on and on including one for the queen's mother, crown prince, and library.  Our last stop was to see the Hwangwonjeong which was built on an artificial island and supposed to be quite beautiful but unfortunately was under reconstruction so all we got to see were the workers and a larger wall.  We came back to the main courtyard to witness the colorful changing of the guards ceremony. Periodically, helpful announcements were broadcasted over the PA system to explain the activities or significance. This time, I viewed it from inside the courtyard where I witnessed more activities than previously from outside the gate (though having that backdrop was good for photo ops).  After the ceremony ended, we visited the National Palace Museum which was on the otherside of the courtyard wall from the ceremony. That was a good escape from the heat as the day warmed up."
533,5.0,It's like a picture comes alive... it is nice how the culture was preserve in vast metropolis.. Walking around coz there are different things that you can see and explore.
534,5.0,"A must visit! Don't miss the changing of guard show twice a day. Cross the street and visit the Gwanghwamun Square where you can see King Sejong statue and visit the little informative museum. Free, informative and a nice respite from the heat."
535,4.0,We made a short stop and just took pictures outside the palace. It is nice to take picture with the palace as the background. The palace is also easy to reach via train.
536,5.0,"During the Korean Civil War (1950-53), Hanseong (Seoul today) was changed hands four times and everything in the City was destroyed by Air Raids and Bombs including the Palace of Chosun Dynasty.. The Main Gate of the Gyeongbokgung Palace was also totally destroyed.  Now, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace was rebuilt according to historic look and an tourist attraction event was performed at the Square behind and before the Palace. It is the Gate Guard Rotation Ceremony Show. Everyday, except closed day, has two sections. Morning section at 10 am and afternoon section at 2 pm. No admission fee necessary. Be reminded that you shud come before commenced otherwise you can not enter the Gate during the show. For preview, you can check the >30 seconds videos at map sites of Gyeongbokgung Palace Korea and Gwanghwamun or 12 minutes video at my tube.  One very generous move here is free admission to the Palace for all elders of 65 and above, including foreighners."
537,5.0,It is a must visit place in Korea. Visitors can experience by getting wear traditional handbook. Folk museum and traditional village near by also attracted us lot. Thank you Seoul.
538,5.0,"Right place for a nice walk and to admire a lot of people wearing the traditional hanbok. It's the main Palace of the city so you should not miss it. If you are familiar with Asia and mostly with China, you will feel as you've been there already..."
539,5.0,"This is a beautiful palace on large grounds, housing other temples and museums. One of the central spots to visit. Korean youth often visit in traditional costumes. You will want to plan most of the day to visit here and its associated attractions."
540,5.0,"This is the largest and most spectacular of the ""Five Grand Palaces"", and we consider it a must stop in Seoul. If at all possible, visit this site when you can experience the Changing of the Guard (morning). This is a magnificent event--you will take more photos than you ever imagined. This was part of our tour, and it paid dividends to have a guide."
541,5.0,"The views are amazing !! Good exposure to local tradition and heritage. You must wear a HANBOK! go for the theme hanbok which you can get for approx 30$ You get free entrance to the palace of you do so, but it makes you feel like your in a movie or in a princess movie"
542,4.0,"If you want to see a Korean templethings, this would be Your place to visit. At the time of our visit, there was things under maintenance, but it did not bother too much."
543,4.0,Find guard changing period and go. Huge place so be prepared to walk.A lot of shops nearby for food.
544,5.0,Place to learn korean royal family Outdoor activity bring umbrella Good to see people wearing hanbok 3000 won for admission
545,5.0,Main tourist attraction in Seoul South Korea. Palaces history is so interesting and beautiful stroll around. Lots of historical sites. Must visit if in Seoul.  Love the tourists in their traditional dress.
546,5.0,This is a great Palace to visit. Palace's history and architecture are great. Visit early in the morning to avoid the heat and crowds.
547,4.0,"go with hanbok, then you don't have to pay for the entrance fee. yes, although the fee is cheaper than renting a hanbok, i think you'll feel more in place with hanbok - since many are also wearing them! the place is beautiful, although you might need more time to walk everything - but 2 hours is suffice for phototaking!"
548,5.0,"Of the Joseon Dynasty in Seoul, this is by far our favorite -- though the signnage is less than ideal. Some of the buildings were undergoing renovation and there was no mention until one arrived at the purported location and all that was visible was a wall. But the grounds extensive -- and there are a variety of buildings. If one is only going to a single palace, I would suggest this is the one to visit."
549,5.0,"If you want to know about history and see it first hand, this is the place to visit. It has very interesting story and you will be wowed with its historic sites, buildings and the surroundings. A must visit."
550,5.0,It is within walking distance from our hotel. Vast area and interesting place for a visit. Hop on hop off bus goes to this place.
551,5.0,My friend and I enjoyed our visit here. I would definitely recommend joining one of the free tours. We caught the end of the free English tour and it was helpful for understanding what we were seeing.
552,5.0,"The “military training” at 9.30 was cancelled because it was muddy. But the kids enjoyed seeing the procession. If u arrive at the area early enough like 8.30, u might hv time to explore the Hanbok rental shops that might be open and dress up before the procession.  Note that the ground is not very stroller friendly."
553,5.0,This place is well worth a visit—an important historical site. Grounds are well cared and buildings are really impressive—especially the main throne building.
554,5.0,"Take a whole day to explore this impressive place. There are so many different parts you can wander for ages. Kids can run free to their heart's content which is an extra if you are travelling with children. Make sure to see the change of the guards ( a few times a day). Gyeongbokgung palace is located in the center of Seoul and easy to acces. Bukchon Hanok Village, Insadong and Cheonggyecheon are in walking distance."
555,5.0,"A must see for anyone in Seoul. Walking through the palace gives an impression of what 14th century high society in Korea was like. If you are not coming with a guide, go on line and read about the history and locations within the palace for a forfilling experience."
556,3.0,The palace is at the end of a long boulevard and located in front of some nice hills. Good for photos and watching the changing of guards.
557,5.0,Beautiful old Palace with both striking buildings as well as gardens and ponds. Try to see changing of the guard (several times daily). There is a free English tour of about 60 minutes which is very worth while. Entrance also includes Folk Museum with lovely exhibits of daily life of the period.
558,5.0,"I went there early to avoid the crowds, but there were still too many tourists around the main palace. I recommend you keep walking inside, there would be more peaceful and you can enjoy your time there"
559,5.0,Located in the heart o Seoul and easily accessible by subway. You can spend the whole day wandering around the palace. Do catch the Palace Guard Changing Ceremony.
560,4.0,A very lovely and historic place. Full of wonderful images and architecture this is a must as are the other Palaces of Seoul
561,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung palace is located in the heart of Seoul. It is super easy to access and there are many things that you can enjoy around the palace. You will see many people wearing hanbok which is a traditional clothing of Korea and it is free to enter the place if you wore hanbok. There are many cafes and restaurant around area. you can walk to Cheonggyecheon, Myeongdong, Insadong or Bukchon Hanok village from the palace."
562,5.0,"Rather impressive and you can wander for ages. Would be a great place to let the kids run. Be warned, not much in washroom facilities. Could be improved be have period enactors."
563,5.0,"there's 2 different areas and both charge you 3k won each, though it is really worth it, or way better. especially garden and pond area was great, must see place in Seoul"
564,5.0,When you visit this palace make sure to be there in the morning to see the change of the guards at 10.00 - then take enoug htime to explore all the different bulidings it has to offer. Crowded place but worth it.
565,4.0,"The first time I visited the palace was in 2011 to see the residence of Prince Gian and Prince Troy of Princess Hours. NOw that I'm back with my son, we got to discover more about South Korea through the museum and writings about the palace. We toured on our own and it was a warm day so we spent only a few hours here. It was really wide and we got to cool down while we explored the museums in the area.  If in Korea, it's a must to see this beautiful structure and I'm glad they preserved the old buildings for us tourists to see,"
566,4.0,"If you’re into history then this place is a must see, if you’re not then you’re better off visiting somewhere else. Tour guides will be provided if you’re keen on knowing more about the history of the place on a timed basis. If you’re visiting on summer, prepare some shades or else you will be fried by the hot summer sun. There are some spots that will only open a few times a day, so if you want to visit a particular area, get your schedule right before visiting."
567,5.0,"Firstly, the entrance tickets are very affordable -- W3,000 for adults and W1,500 for children up to 18 years old. These low entrance prices make the visit worthwhile to learn about the place and take photos. And a tourist has to take photos, right? Secondly, anyone can gain free entrance by wearing a traditional Korean costume, which can be rented from stores across the main gate of the palace (free entrance in other palaces too, while wearing the traditional Korean costume). This makes your selfie photos inside the palace even better :). Thirdly, the place was lightly filled when we came in on a Saturday late morning. Stay about 2 hours minimum, about 3 hours maximum."
568,4.0,"This was the first, largest and the main royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. It was destroyed during the Japanese occupation and has taken much time and effort to be rebuilt and restored. The Changing of the Guard happened while I was there at about 9:30am. Free admission to even foreigner seniors. Many of the girls and some boys even wore the hanbok costumes for Instagram photos. From here one can go to the Folk Museum and then on to Bukchon Hanbok Village and then the Chandeokgong Palace which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Expect to spend many hours exploring this whole area as it is well worth it. Moving on from there take in lunch on Insadong Street and browse the shops. This will be such a day well spent in Seoul."
569,5.0,You cannot come to Seoul and not visit here. A must see. Gives you a great history of Seoul and you get to see how Royalty lived centuries ago.
570,4.0,We visited this palace. This is by far the biggest palace so be prepared to walk a reasonable distance to cover most of the area. A lot of the buildings are very similar in style and it is interesting from a historical view. There was a changing of the guard which was colorful. Take a bottle of water as there are only a couple of places in the palace compound to get drinks. Worth the visit.
571,4.0,This was built 6 centuries ago and is a really impressive palace in the centre of Seoul. The place is huge and can get quite sunny with little shade so don’t forget suncream and water. There are guards at the gate to look at and pose for photos with. We joined a free guided tour in English which started at 1:30 (they have some more but unsure on the times). This was really useful to tell us about each palace building and point out things you may have missed otherwise. It was hard to believe this is right in the middle of the city! Huge open space with big lavish palace buildings.
572,5.0,Nice and ancient grand palace of Joseon Dynasty of South Korea. There are more other palace that should be visited.
573,5.0,A MUST visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace. The grounds have been restored. The Changing of the Guard. Highly recommended.
574,5.0,A must go if you are a history addict! The museum offers free english guided tours at selected timings and the guide is very informative and lovely!  Try to go before 9 am to get the tickets and roam around before the first english guided tour at 1030 to avoid the scorching hot sun later in the day during summer. The palace gets rather crowded and becomes difficult to take a good photo without other tourists in it.  The palace is very well maintained and many areas worth exploring after the tour. One of the perks of wearing the Hanbok to the palace is that you get free entrance into all the palaces. Do note that this palace is close on Tuesdays.
575,5.0,My family visited this palace and had a good experience exploring it. The palace covered a big area. Be prepared to walk a bit if you intend to cover every bit of it. Palace is easily accessible as it is located near to a Seoul Metro Station (Gyeongbokgung). You will need to purchase tickets to enter the palace too.
576,4.0,This place was incredible. It was huge and incredibly maintained. We had gone during winter and there weren't too many people and so we were able to really walk around comfortably away from crowd. It was cold in the winter -- just as a precaution. There are nearby stores that rent out traditional Korean clothing for those who want to take pictures; this was very common.
577,5.0,"If u wear a hanbok to this place, your entrance fee is waived. Yes, I know the hanbok rental cost more than the entrance fee lol, but it’s the experience that counts. Overall a very beautiful place though some of the renovations were quite obviously of recent make. But it doesn’t detract from the beauty of the place."
578,5.0,"Feel very humble inside this place, but it’s crowded and sometime hard to move or take pictures at the same time"
579,5.0,"We really liked that the Palace provided free guided tours in English which helped us learn and understand the different structures within the complex, and the life of the Korean royals back in the day. This is especially interesting to those who watch K-Dramas."
580,5.0,"One of the key cultural attractions of Korea in my opinion! There are many shops around the palace that rent traditional clothing especially to go to the palace, so that's what I did (foreigners are wlecomed to do so!). I loved walking around the castle and taking pictures. There are many tourists inside the main court but of you venture into the gardens behind the castle it gets less crowded."
581,5.0,Feel the pulse of the bustling capital of South Korea. This picturesque palace is the first royal palace built in 1395 during the time of the Joseon dynasty.
582,4.0,Really beautiful palace. Worth visiting while in Seoul.beautiful buildings and gateways. Clothing hire available. Wonderful architecture.Had a lovely walk around the palace grounds
583,5.0,"We visited on Memorial Day. So everybody were out in their traditional hanboks, plus the Honour Guard really complemented the traditional pageantry. A must visit when in Seoul. Korean traditional architecture at it’s best, set in beautiful, extensive gardens."
584,4.0,"Still one of the places to visit when you are in Seoul. The palace is so intricately made and the mountain at the back is so amazing. However, it is so big but there is only 1 or 2 toilets nearby."
585,5.0,"The original palace dates back to the 1300s but various invasions by the Japanese in the 1500s, 1800s and 1910 has meant a lot fo the original palace has been destroyed. Much of the palace is reproductions of the original buildings but the architecture is still very impressive. Be equipped with walking shoes and headwear as the palace is quite expansive and exposed"
586,4.0,"We visited the palace on the last Wednesday of the month, so the admission was free. However, a fee is charged for the guided tour. The palace area was large. There were many tourists wearing Hanbok at the palace. We saw the changing of guard ceremony. There is also a cafe that sells snacks and souvenirs in the palace area."
587,4.0,"only issue was that wehn we there, they were preparing for some sort of conference, so missed the photo with the reflection!"
588,4.0,It’s a big place with long heritage and old construction building. But I have been to Beijing Forbidden Palace. The construction heritage and treasures of this palace just can’t compare to that
589,5.0,"We had a beautiful and enjoyable experience here. Rented a hanbok from nearby and took photos and videos in this Unesco heritage site. It was a really nice day. Come with a full stomach as food is not allowed inside. Or have snacks outside by the exit before or after. We enjoyed the dumpling shop and CU store, in our hanbok :-) Well kept and beautiful Palace.  Staff in Secret Garden was kind and helped us on our way, especially when we were last in the group. Thank you for the English conversation and encouraging words to us as we walked up and down and climbed the steps."
590,3.0,"Saw many local and tourists wearing the traditional costumes and indeed they brightened up the whole place, which was just ancient buildings. And it is amazing to see how the building was built with small caving like holes for firewood so that the whole building could be kept warm during winter time."
591,4.0,Love the architecture and colours on the palace . It wax good to see the guards in traditional dress. There are also a lot of ladies dressed in hanbok. 3000 Won entrance fee. Souvenir shop and cafe off to the side.
592,5.0,"this is a huge space with beautifully reconstructed gates, temples, and recreation areas. If one rents a native costume and wears it into the grounds, admission is free. Many tourists do this and it adds a flair to the grounds and they all seem to be enjoying their moment in native dress. It is a fairly large site and one can spend a great deal of time there or one can see the highlights in about an hour plus and move on. I highly recommend visiting."
593,2.0,Nice taking photographs but long walk from station. Many people wearing the Hanbok. Good for children to understand their culture.
594,4.0,"I arrived in time to watch the changing of the guard at the entrance. It's long, involved and colourful. It's a busy place but there's lots to see. I joined a guided tour and am glad I did as it is vital to understand the place. There were a lot of tourists wearing hired traditional costumes wandering around adding to the colour."
595,3.0,Very clean area and can get very crowded during weekends. Good for photo shoots.  Entrance is free. If you want to rent the Korean traditional costumes it is readily available near the palace before entry and very cheap as well.
596,4.0,If you are looking to see a bit of history in Seoul the palace is worth a visit. Make sure to be there for the changing of the guard at 2pm. The Palace museum next to the actual palace is also very interesting.
597,5.0,"I’ve watch many period dramas, I’ve read quite a few books on Korean History and always enjoyed documentaries in regards to the history of Joseon Dynasty. But to walk through it, to sit within the palace walls and have tea with dessert really made my knowledge come together."
598,5.0,To get the full appreciation of the site one needs to walk through the entire grounds and visit the museum. The Palace really shows a lot of Korean culture. We ran into a few groups of Korean students outside the Palace which put us in the right mood from the beginning.
599,4.0,"The entrance, main palace and the palace museum are a must see (KW3000 entrance fee). The changing of the guards is an added bonus if you happen to be on time for the event. Note that the palace is expansive which require a lot of walking on stone path and gravel. There are not much shaded tress and places to rest expect around buildings. So an early morning visit is recommended. I made a reservation for an English guided tour of the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion only be disappointed as the tour guide decided to conduct it in the local vernacular. I did inquire though as she stated that she can give me a 10 minute English guide after she is done with the group but left before she finished."
600,3.0,"Visited The Palace on our first day in Seoul. It is a beautiful place to visit, but I was saddened to read it’s history as we walked around. So often I learned about the demolition of Korean historical / sacred buildings being destroyed by enemies throughout the centuries. This Palace had been greatly recreated in recent years. Having said that the grounds are definitely worth a visit, tourists can hire Hangbok ( traditional costume) to wear and visit the palace in and many do and take hundreds of selfies. There is also a Changingof the Guards at certain times. Very colourful."
601,4.0,This palace was very large & a bit hard to finish the tour but it's very good. The palace was informative & interesting stories about the culture & history of Korean!
602,4.0,"Worth the visit, easily accessible from train station. Could spend the day here and nearby villages."
603,5.0,Beautiful ancestral place. Having a tour guide to fill you in about all the history is great. Would recommend this to anyone visiting the area.
604,5.0,"Must see buildings, water garden, and crowds all dressed in traditional Korean costumes. Enjoy the Folk Museum within."
605,5.0,We went through the palace fairly quickly because there were so many people when we were there. I think school field trip was happening and there were tons of kids everywhere. It would have been nicer if it wasn't so crowded.
606,5.0,"Free entry on Wednesday is a bonus but either way the grounds are extensive and beautiful with palace complex, craft shop and museum all in one spot. Great way to spend an afternoon. I shall return in order to see the changing of the guards."
607,4.0,"We arrived at about 10am and found out that there is a free english tour at 11am. So, after walking around a bit, enjoying the view, we waited for the tour. There was about 30pax waiting for the tour to start. A lady dressed in a lovely hanbok gave us a tour. We enjoyed the tour a lot because the information provided about the palace were very interesting. You will appreciate the palace structure, architecture and culture better. The walking tour took 1 hr and after that, we were free to roam around the palace. Very enjoyable tour, highly recommended!"
608,4.0,"My traveling to south korean finally completed by visit palace. A very great experience to enter the palace wearing hanbok, felt like a princess for a day. This palace has a huge areas, hence it might be exhausted to look around yet so fun. So guys if you have chance to come to korea, you must be come here."
609,3.0,"Beautiful traditional palace of the last ruling dynasty. The free guided tour was great with explanation on the architecture, history and culture. Recommend doing it at the beginning if your trip."
610,5.0,"This place is huge and it's a maze inside. But it's fun to walk around and especially the pavillion on the water looks great. It was really crowded, though."
611,5.0,"A wonderful and huge palace to visit, the place is very wide and i guess it will take almost few hours to complete the whole place to visit. This is one of must places to visit. There are Museum, park, lot of unique buildings (palaces), kids zone and many more. You will spend almost half day or even full day here...."
612,4.0,"Being one of the prominent sites for tourists, Gyeonbokgung can get very busy. Try to time your visit to see the changing of the guard - it's actually quite impressive. There is no charge to watch the changing of the guard, but if you want to go inside the palace there is a small (not unreasonable) fee. Make sure you find a spot in the crowds near to the roped off area so that you can see what's going on. The palace grounds are vast. After visiting the buildings closest to the entrance, keep walking to see all the buildings behind. You'll find you get right away from the bulk of the crowds and can better enjoy the ambience of the place."
613,5.0,A massive complex which was a great experience. Surrounded by lovely grounds and the wonderful guards display. The guards seemed to change on the hour.
614,4.0,wonderful experience seeing all the people in traditional hanboks everywhere at the palace grounds . A place one should not miss.
615,5.0,"Beautiful, peaceful!! So amazing to see everyone Dress up and take photos in traditional garb.Adorable, mothers and daughters, girls, boys and young families all done up.. so stunning. It’s a large enclosed palace grounds with loads of history and traditional Korean culture to take in.. cheap to get in and lots of ground to cover, perfect for a long stroll through time and a must if your visiting Seoul!!! Right downtown"
616,4.0,"Put on traditional costume to get free entry, and be photographed at your best ancient look! Spend at least 3 hours there as we did, and we also had a volunteer guide (a high school English student) showing us around."
617,3.0,"Although not the most attractive, Gyeongbokgung palace is the biggest and the main palace in Seoul. So, ot is a must visit tourist attraction. Very crowded all the time, free entrance for visitors wearing traditional korean dress (Hanbok), that can be rented near the palace. Quieter areas are the walls surrounding the palace, with the pillars making the colorful walls and ornate ceiling beams more attractive for photos (instagram). Changing of the guard around 11:00am is also an interesting attraction to watch."
618,5.0,"This place is just gorgeous. You have the option of taking a guided tour but I opted to just wander around on my own. Signage is in Korean and English and there are printed guides in several languages. If you want to stick to a set time frame take the guided tour, but note yours in your language are limited to specific times of the day and the tour will typically last an hour to an hour and a half. I personally had fun wandering at my own pace and ended up spending several hours walking, viewing, thanking photos and videos, sitting and people watching, etc. it’s just a beautiful setting and experience."
619,5.0,"This is the Forbidden City of Korea. From an architectural perspective, very fascinating! It is quite similar to Chinese royal architecture, but there are plenty of differences to make it distinctly its own. If you like architecture, you will love wondering around this palace, and the tiny doors everywhere are so cute.  Don't pay for a tour! All of the sites in Seoul have free English speaking tours, the trick is to find out the time, and to be on time for them. I found these tours to be fascinating, enjoyable, and full of information, so I highly recommend them.  In the back is a gorgeous garden, with the Bukhansan Mountain as a backdrop, especially during the autumn, breathtaking. Stop by the Blue House (Korean version of the White House). And you have to spend a good hour in the folk museum which had a bunch of traditional and cultural artifacts, an ancient Hanok home, and a ~1960s style shopping street."
620,5.0,"A place to learn about the history of Korea in the Joseon Dynasty on the different palaces where the King worked and lived. Scenic cultural place with many stories told by the official guided tour, a great learning experience about old Korea. You may also want to watch the guards changing ceremony at the entrance of the Palace at designated timeslots and engage with a tourguide or audio guide yourself to hear about the tales of the Kings."
621,4.0,I love how clean it is remained and how easy to come here. Just take a train and you'll get it here. Do explore outside gyeongbokgung palace for some street food
622,4.0,"For those wanted to explore and to know more the culture of Korea,I highly recommended this place. Everything here is picturesque especially during autumn season. Got to appreciate more the colorful history of Korea."
623,5.0,"Where is the best place to see the changing of the guards? It is outside the gate, where you get the closest to the guard. Do not go into the big yard inside the gate. They will pass through it and the actual changing of the guard is in front of the Gate."
624,3.0,"Accesible via mrt Gyeongbokgung Palace Station (Seoul Subway Line 3), Exit 5. Do catch-up the ""Changing Guards Ceremony"" at 10:00, 13:00 or 15:00. Avoid morning in the weekend as it was super crowded and it's hard to get good pictures with the only background of the palace."
625,5.0,Went here mid of May with my wife and friends. The place is so huge and very rich in history. We went early and were very fortunate to see the change of guards ceremony. You will see men in Korean traditional soldier uniforms including their weapons. Inside are structures but for most of them you can only glance from outside. Tips: - Wear appropriate footwear. The place is huge you'll do a lot of walking. - The ceremony starts around 10am. Be there early and go to a good spot to watch. - You can try the soldier uniforms. Area is near the first gate if I'm not mistaken. - May is cold but very sunny so bring umbrella. - Bukchon Hanok Village is like 20-30min walk from here. You may want to consider walking as the streets outside were also nice. The palace wall are great from outside.
626,4.0,A tourist destination for everyone. Large complex and very interesting. The entrance is very colourful with the well dressed guards. Don't miss the change of guards at midday. A bit dusty path on a dry hot day. Ensure to have a hat or umbrella.
627,4.0,Good for travellers who would like to learn much about the Korean traditional matters. The free guides were polite and helpful.
628,4.0,This quite large and well kept palace consists of large wooden ornate buildings in a park like setting. You don't need to go on a tour to visit any of these sort of places. Taxis in Seoul are really inexpensive and will get you to where you want to go for short distances. For longer distances the Metro is fantastic. But I advise you to make good use of Google Maps to get you around the system. But be aware that Maps quotes the stations names in Hangul characters. I ended up with my own special way of recognising parts of the characters!!!  The palace is a hot and dry place so ensure that you have water with you. There are some relatively steep sections in parts so if this presents a problem be careful to allow plenty of time.
629,4.0,I visited Gyeongbokgung Palace few time. As I go free & easy without a guide in Korea. I have realised that it was so easy to move around in Seoul with the metro. I did some research before I arrive Korea. They have all the difference time for changing guide at the main gate. It take about 30 minutes with all the parade in traditional costume. The Palace provide difference timing for free tour with English & Chinese Speaking guide daily. The tour will be guide you through the Palace and gave you the detail explanation of the Palace. Please make use of the free service and you save a lot of money.
630,5.0,"If you are looking to be temporarily immersed in Korea culture while in hustling-bustling downtown Seoul, this palace is a must-see destination. The palace grounds are hardly tucked away in some obscure corner of the sprawling metropolis of Seoul, for they extend over several hundred acres, and do offer some quietude compared to outside the gates.  You will find numerous buildings that are splendid in their grandeur, and also old, twisted pines that represent the long-time suffering of the Korean population under colonial rule. One of the most captivating scenes is the grand lake, which begs for photos during cherry blossom season, the colorful autumn, and also during the evening.  In closing, KNTO (Korean National Tourism Office) offers a pass to three palaces all within a few Kms of each other, which is a highly recommended to take in these incredible venues for a taste of tradition in the midst of one of the most modern cities in the world."
631,5.0,"Without doubt this was my favourite attraction in Seoul. We arrived just before 1400 meaning w could enjoy the whole change of the guard ceremony. Great fun.  After that we wondered into the palace and genuinely were in awe with how beautiful it was. Of course the clear blue sky and nice weather helped with the atmosphere.  Closed on Tuesday's so plan accordingly. To access use Subway line 3 exit 5, or just wonder through this beautiful city and arrive when you arrive :-)"
632,4.0,"It was the first royal palace built in the Joseon Dynasty and where the Joseon Dynasty 500 year history began. It is the largest of the 5 grand palaces remaining in Seoul. You should plan to visit it together with the 2 museums in the palace grounds, National Palace Museum and National Folk Museum of Korea. We bought a combined ticket to the palaces which also includes a guided tour of Jongmyo Shrine and the Secret Garden, Changdeokgung Palace as you save money. However be prepared to walk a lot as the different buildings are spread over a large area. Do also make time to see the changing of the guards ceremony on the hour from 10am to 4 pm at the grand main gate, Gwanghwamun. After you have reach the end of the palace grounds, you can catch a glimpse of The Blue Office of the President. The office is situated just across the road with Mt.Bugaksan in the background. The only setback is that there are very few tall trees to give shade, compared to the other three palaces."
633,4.0,If you are a fan of arts history and culture this is definitely the place for you. Very serene palace with a hall exhibiting tea ceremony live. Please find out when is the free guided tour as it is only available at certain time or you will end up not knowing any of the history accurately. Entrance is 3000won(I think) and to the museum is free :) enjoy!
634,4.0,"this palace was the biggest than other palace, seem like Forbidden city at Beijing but it's smaller. We visit at rainy days but lucky we are to seen they are beautiful on rain. the Palace including couple buildings for King, and you can buy the maps only for 500 Won at information. Entrance fee is 3.000 won and I think it's cheap.  inside the Palace you will found the King home and many buildings with Korean architecture and cultural. And it will finished at Folk Museum.  For me it's little bit boring since I not a historical person, but the garden ruins it."
635,5.0,- The guard changing ceremony is very fascinating and educational. - Try the guard changing costume. What an experience! - I just love how the staffs of the palace wear traditional clothes. - Easily accessible by subway. Just 10 minutes walk from there.
636,5.0,"Don't miss the change of the guards because here there is a commentary for explanation of what is going on. And the colours! I've never seen such splendidly clothed guards. Loved it! Entry is free when you wear a hanbok.  The palace area is huge and you will spend about 2 hours here. There is also the National Korean Folk Museum in which you can learn a lot about Korea, it's culture and historical development. Then, there is a little area to see how the houses on the palace grounds looked throughout the ages. It is right next to the Children's Museum. You see, you can visit a lot of places here and will definitely see a lot of old houses."
637,5.0,"We had a guided tour for the morning, if you can get there in time to see the change of guards is a awesome experience. This place is nothing short of amazing. It is VERY big! Take at least 2 hrs to get around it all. Great richness of Korean History. Great value for money."
638,5.0,"the palace is sooooo big. You'll need maybe 2 hours if you want to look carefully at the palace or taking picture in every corner of the palace. I think the palace is very photogenic and beautiful. If you come on Sunday, there's a flea market infront of the palace, it's worth to visit."
639,4.0,"We took the subway. Long walk coming and going.  Nice buildings. Did not catch the changeing of the guards- I dont know where to find it. Place was huge! We just enjoyed its beauty - I did not get an audio guide. Bring water, lots of sunblock, sunglasses, and wear comfortable shoes.  After, we tried to catch a taxi. Unfortunately no taxi stands that we knew of. So walked back thru subway."
640,5.0,"We (me and my husband) came here around 11am on a Monday, so we avoided too much crowd. There were still enough people to keep it exciting, kids too! The ticket is 3000 won per person, which is great value. We did not purchase any audio guide or English guide book, we felt like exploring it ourselves. It was actually quite fun this way, lots to explore and it was a very different palace architecture with lot of open bits inside the palace too. I liked the roofs and doors design. We spent about 3 hours there and we just took a stroll and wandered - not sure if we saw the whole thing. The weather was beautiful and very sunny, although my husband who is white got sun burnt as we were out in the open for most of the time :-) so make sure you apply plenty of sun screen if you don't want to be burnt.  There are boards with information in English too, which helps. Attached photos!"
641,4.0,"One of the few palaces you shouldn't miss-out during your holiday is Seoul. The buildings were quite magnificent. It opens from 9am till 6pm...but it's great there's free guides tours conducted on English @ 11am, 1:30pm & 3.30pm. The changing of guard was amazing...dress in their traditional regalia with sound of drums. Explore all the different buildings & grounds ...would take me a good few hours. This place captivates me... Ending ...by reaching to a main road right across is the Blue House."
642,4.0,"The palace is without doubt a fantastic spectacle. It's gloriously cheap (3000 won for an adult) and can easily fill a morning or afternoon. The main palace, rebuilt in the 19th century, after it was destroyed in previous centuries by the Japanese, is in excellent condition. Further to this the grounds are quite extensive and we were surprised to see more structures, ponds and walkways after every corner. A true highlight is of course the changing of the guard which happens 3 times a day. If you go earlier on each one you can see them practice outside the palace.  Being my first time this Far East, it was a hugely fabulous place to behold and is by far the best of the palaces in the city. Visit!"
643,5.0,"I've traveled all over Europe and visited my share of castles, but the grand scale of the grounds and buildings included in Gyeonbokgung cast a shadow on everything I've witnessed before. It is massive and a bit daunting. Make sure to wear comfortable walking shoes and grab a guidebook (offered in several languages) or hook up with a tour guide.  The main (most famous) gates of Gyeonbokgung are right off of Gwanghwamun Square, not far from the notable statue of King Sejong (which is another must-see when in Seoul). It's very easy to get here by subway, bus, or taxi; although, I suggest taking the subway - it's super inexpensive, and is possibly the BEST subway system I've ever experienced, EVER. (Very safe. Very clean. Very easy to navigate, even if you don't speak Korean or read Hangual.)  We exited the subway (sorry, can't remember which line or number), and it spit us out right by a museum/gift shop that had a side entrance to the palace. It worked out perfectly! We walked in the gates and were in the main, large open courtyard inside the main gates (that are on street level in Gwanghwamun Square).  The palace is always teeming with tourists from all over the world. It's bustling and dizzying and amazing all at once. Unlike European castles, there isn't just one, central building; but instead, multitudes of buildings with similar architecture scattered throughout the grounds. Some are open to be viewed (like the private rooms of the royal family members or the throne and state rooms) while others are boarded up and can only be viewed from the outside. There are beautiful flowers and water areas in different parts of the complex.  My favorite part was Hyangwonjeong Pavilion - an ""island"" in the northern grounds of the palace connected by a wooden bridge to the rest of the grounds. You're not allowed to enter the island, but it's magical to look at.  If you want to be extra thorough and make it to the back of the complex (where the servants and guards quarters are), you should probably allow yourself 3 hours or so to meander around. This is not the type of attraction where you are in and out in an hour! There is so much to see, you could easily spend most of a day here or split the grounds up and visit on two different days.  Although built in 1395, the palace was been rebuilt in the late 1800's due to fire (the buildings are nearly all made of wood); but the Koreans took great care to reconstruct the palace as it originally stood.  It's open most days from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. but is closed on Mondays or Tuesdays (can't remember which, but it was closed the first time we tried to visit) and holidays (check the website (http://www.royalpalace.go.kr/html/eng/main/main.jsp) to make sure it will be open when you intend to visit.  An absolute MUST-SEE. You will not regret visiting, and I suggest taking a walk through the nearby gift shop I mentioned. I'm sure the items are more expensive than elsewhere, but I never saw things they had for sale anywhere else but there. Worth it if you're looking for a unique memento of your visit to Seoul/Korea."
644,5.0,You would never believe that you are in the city when you are browsing round these temples. There are many more cute temples in the surround area which your ticket includes. It is a great place to visit.
645,4.0,"We went there to check out the palace but then we figure out something else. Every hour, they would have guard changing ceremony. about 10-15 people march out with drumroll. they replace the guard then goes in back. I could remember when is the last change but probably about 4pm. Anyway, if you are interested to try their guard's clothing, do stand infront of an isolated building on the compound 10 min after the guard changing start. they only accept few people but it was open every hour. If you missed once, you still have next hour. do go in 3 person or more. As the person in charge wont help you to take picture. If not, you only can depend on selfie~ I couldnt talk bout the palace as we ran out of it to watch the guard changibg ceceremony. Afterwrd we couldnt go in back. So if you wanted to check the palace, come early and watch the guard changing, then only you should go in. Sharp on time ok?"
646,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung was within walking distance of my BnB and a great place to walk around. You can complete a decent circuit on your own in about 30-45 minutes. Try to time things so that you can be at the Gwanghwamun gate on the hour between 10am and 4pm. The 10am, 1pm and 3pm times are the extended show while the other hours only show a shortened version. Since the whole reenactment is only about 15 mins long, I'm not sure there is much at all to see with a shortened version! You don't need an extra ticket to see the changing of the guard, you just need to be in the right place at the right time."
647,5.0,"We reached the place nearly 3PM local time. It is the right timing where the guard changing ceremony was about to begin. It was awesome!! After the 20min changing ceremony, we were quickly run to the booth where you can try on the guard outfit - for FREE!!! have fun!!"
648,3.0,"There are a lot of palaces in Seoul, but this one is the biggest and easiest to visit. Nice scenic walks around the grounds, changing of the guard ceremony, nice buildings... ticks all the boxes."
649,5.0,"It's cold in the courtyard as the winter wind just sweeps across the open from the mountains. Put on extra during winter time and go with a guide or something because it can get really, really boring looking at the same buildings again and again."
650,4.0,"I liked how well arranged this museums decorated. It has a very detail memorabilia about Korean culture. Despite its small building of museum (due to the main attraction is the Palace), you will still be amused. Inside the Palace, you can take a picture (for free) with girls wearing national costumes of South Korea. The toilets need some upgrade and somehow I do amazed to see a woman house cleaning staff simply enter male toilet and Korean male seemed not to be disturbed by that (ithough i felt a bit awkward). My tour guide said this Palace better visited during fall"
651,5.0,"wear comfortable shoes and maybe an umbrella if you are there during the summer. I have been here twice, on a fall and just this summer. I would say best time to see this place is during the summer when all the leaves are colorful. The area is situated in the middle of the city but it is pretty magical when you are inside. It's like you are transported to a different era. The place is very well kept. Don't forget to bring your camera!"
652,4.0,"If you're interested in old palace architectures, this is the place for you. The area is not as grand and big as the Forbidden City in Beijing; but still need a good half-day effort to cover the compound. We were there in early Dec 2014. Although the temperature was a bit chilly, there were still many visitors; including a lot of local students. I would image the place must be packed during summer time. The National folk museum of Korea is adjacent to Gyeongbokgung, so you may plan to spend a whole day in the same area to visit both locations. Gyeongbokgund subway (No. 3 line) has a station just outside the palace. Suggest to start the visit early in the day.  A near-by restaurant called Tosokchon that serves ginseng chicken soup is worth the visit for a meal as well; especially in winter. The hot soups will surely warm up your body in no time."
653,3.0,"We were there at around 11 in the morning in late autumn. Weather was good but the wind was quite strong.  We walked from the Bukchon Hanok Village, where we stayed for a night. Took us about 20 minutes or so.  If you are a foreigner travelling on own, best thing is to time your visit with the free guided tours. We thought we would go ahead without the tour and this is something we regretted, given the size of this place and lack of signboards to tell you any historical facts and your exact location as well. We found ourselves lost for an hour, ending up at some garden, smaller palaces and the National Folk Museum and had to go one big round to come out to the entrance.  If you are planning to visit more palaces, suggest you take the Combination ticket, which will cover Gyeongbokgung, Chandeukgung, Chanseukgung (if I'm not mistaken) Deoksugung, and Jongmyo shrine which costs KRW10k (I recall it would be cheaper by KRW2k if you bought the tickets separately).  Although we were in Seoul throughout the stay and decided we should visit most, we didn't and only managed to visit this, Chandeukgung and Jongmyo shrine so the Combination ticket was not worth it but could come in handy.  I would prefer Chandeukgung, which is about 20 minutes walk away as it is much more interesting."
654,4.0,"The visit there was amazing, and in the winter, it makes for great snow angel-making grounds. And oh! It overlooks the Blue House (the Korean equivalent of the White House)"
655,4.0,"Lovely grounds and charming with autumnal colours, the largest pond is a highlight. The buildings are beautiful to look at.  Attempted an English tour but this was a challenge to understand (we are English) so we wandered at our own leisure which was great.  The Folk museum is a bizarre addition but worth a look around, particularly the Jean exhibition which will amuse Westerners with it's stylised curation."
656,4.0,"Beautiful place. Nice place to take pictures. went in winter(mid november). One of the palace building is closed to public during winter- open from april to sept(i hope my memory is not failing on me)  Must go for the guided tour(available in English, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean). Last about 1 hour, which bring you through the palace and tell you the history of Korean royal family and the korean palace architecture.  The one of the interesting attractions was the guards that stood outside the palace( something like the guards in Windsor castle(london)), but with colorful uniforms and more guards and korean musical and flags.. they did the marching (went at ~130pm so get to observe the change of guard ceremony ~2pm)  Not necessary to buy the palace map if you go for the guided tour. the palace map cost 5000 won."
657,5.0,beautiful place. huge place. there's a coffee shop inside. the cashier is pretty. i took pictures but she told me not to take pictures. it would be great to visit there in autumn - for the trees. this place has an entrance fee.
658,5.0,"Being a korean series fanatic, visiting a palace is a must-place-to-visit for me. The palace groound is really really huge. Visiting in the peak of autumn is an added value to the beauty of the place. There are benches that you can sit upon. I like the one that faces the moat. Make sure that you get to see the changing of guards ceremony (http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_2_1.jsp?cid=292853)  Directions: Gyeongbokgung Palace Station (Seoul Subway Line 3), Exit 5 Fee: 3000 won for adults"
659,3.0,"This is the biggest palace in Seoul. However, it's overcrowded with tourists and tour groups. Highly recommended to visit during less busy period to soak in the atmosphere."
660,3.0,"Gyeongbokgung is the largest palace in Seoul, and I did appreciate all the structures and the grand scale of things. However, I think other palaces are much more interesting. Gyeongbokgung feels like a tourist trap and has too many visitors. The landscaping here isn't all that exciting compared to, say, Changdeokgung, which was built in harmony with nature. I would recommend visiting this palace to experience the grandeur and the guard changing ceremony, but also take a look at other palaces around Seoul."
661,4.0,"The palace is very accessible by train as a train station leads directly to the palace complex. A good time is visit is at 9 a.m. because you can watch the opening of the gates in the traditional way. We did not take the tour but was able to see the different parts of the palace, taking time to notice the cultural artifacts. We saw many Korean school children visit this palace, a testimony that the palace is important to Koreans."
662,4.0,"A very large compound in the middle of Seoul, the contrast between the old palace roofs and the surrounding skyscrapers is impressive. The compound is very large, so be sure to take comfortable shoes along. It's very beautiful, there is lots to see and everything is well-kept. I found it less crowded than I had imagined it to be, it's very easy to reach by metro and the entrance fee is very low, around 3 USD. They have guided tours, although we always prefer to go on our own. You can't go inside any of the rooms or buildings, but it's still impressive to see it from outside. We were able to take millions of lovely pictures, and greatly enjoyed our visit. There is a great little Samgyetong place called ""Tosokchon"" not far, which is prized with selling the best Ginseng Chicken in Seoul. That's how we rounded off our day there.  If you have time, if you like walking, and if you want to see the largest Palace in Seoul then this is the place to go."
663,4.0,"It is a good place to learn more Korean history!! It is very big, you can spend half day to visit there."
664,5.0,"Love the guards at the front gate. Free dress up in guard costumes, cheap entry fee. Beautiful sceneries with mountains views behind the palace buildings."
665,4.0,"All five palaces are basically identical...you may as well go to this one as it is the biggest.  Try and arrive or leave on the hour and you will get the changing of the guard show.  The palaces are good but they are all the same...same layout, same style, same interiors...just five of them..."
666,5.0,Gyeongbokgung Palace is the largest palace in Seoul. It is at the end of the main blvd. We watched the changing of the guard at the palace gate on the way in and on the way out a more elaborate changing of the guard ceremony was being held. The grounds are vast and there is also the Korean Folk Museum included with your admission price. It was a very hot day so going in the museum was very enjoyable. The museum was informative about Korean culture and was very interesting. we probably spent 2 1.5 hours at the palace complex.
667,4.0,"It is a sprawling compound which encompasses many halls and living quarters plus 2 museums. Avoid going on weekends as there are many tour groups present! You could spend up to 3 hours walking the palace grounds and museums, all for an affordable fee of 3000won each. Be sure to bring a bottle as there are hardly any shops selling drinks."
668,4.0,Beautiful once you walk through the grounds. Loved the National Folk Museum as it explained Korean life and why Koreans eat kimchi. It is large and it was very hot the day we visited so very tiring to walk around. Watched the guard ceremony. hotel bus too us here-subway home.
669,3.0,"This is a nice palace located in central Seoul. The buildings are old and beautiful. You can also watch the changing of guards. We were told that this was at 1pm and 3pm, but when we arrived at 3 pm the ceremony was already finished. I think it began at 2.30 so heads up for that. You can also visit the folk museum of Korea which is just outside the area. The cost is 3000 won pp"
670,4.0,"Pro : Located in the city area. Accessible via metro. Pretty cheap admissions. Free guided tour available. Large compound. Quite a number of attractions to see. Historical. Learn how royalty lives. Nice garden. Great ambiance. Lovely pavilions.  Con : Most of the buildings are re-built or replica as the original were destroyed/demolished. Huge compound. Lots of walking required. After a while, one building looks like another…"
671,5.0,"This is our the first attraction we visited in S. Korea. The place is awesome. Surrounded by high rise buildings is a huge and well preserved palace. For just 3000 KWon, you not only see this picturesque palace but you can also see the National Folk Museum. It is worth every KWon. This tourist spot is also accessible, there is a subway connecting the palace. Dont miss the changing of guards ceremony."
672,4.0,The palace is very pretty. Not spectacular at all but very pretty and a nice place to kill some time. Went there today with my mother. It is packed and just empty shells of buildings. The highlight is the free folk art museum.  Never the less enjoyed this palace with what could be a tranquil setting all for the price of $3
673,5.0,"This is the definitive sight to see if you are traveling to Seoul. If you have seen other palaces in your life, it might be somewhat underwhelming. If you have never been to anything like this before, you're in for a treat. The palace only costs $3 per person to enter, and it is extensive. Eat in advance, and enjoy the sights.  If you arrive at a certain time, you will be able to see the guard change at the gate ceremony. This is an added benefit but not really necessary. There are English, Chinese and Japanese translations for those interested in a summary of what is happening, though. You can also view the guard change ceremony at other palaces in the Seoul area if you do happen to miss the one at Gyeonbokgung but still are interested in seeing it. As an aside, you do not need to actually pay the palace entrance fee to view the guard change ceremony, which is nice if you're just passing by and want to watch.  About the palace itself: It is the largest of the five great palaces in Seoul, although I'm not sure about how it stands compared to other palaces in Korea. It is located near the northern end of the city, opposite of the N Seoul Tower. There are guided tours given of the palace, and I would definitely recommend coming during tour time, otherwise you will just be looking at buildings and have no idea what you are looking at! Like the gate guard change ceremony, the tours are given in Korean, Japanese, Chinese and English. They are given at different times, and each language tour is given at different frequencies (i.e. the English one is given about three times a day, while the Chinese one is only given once a day).  The tour takes an hour, and you will see the majority of the palace grounds and buildings. I have done the tour twice, and both tour guides were excellent, and they each gave me different information, which was nice. After the tour, you are obviously free to go back and see anything you might have missed or wanted to spend more time doing. During the tour, you will have time for pictures, as well.  After you have seen the palace, I recommend doing two things:  1. The Blue House (Korea's equivalent of the White House) can be seen by leaving through one of the exits (near the northwest, next to the pond). That exit is as close as you can get to the Blue House (unless you schedule a tour, which takes a month or two in advance to schedule), so it is a good place to take pictures and see something you may otherwise never be able to see. As an aside, if you leave the exit, you can re-enter through the same way you left after you have seen the Blue House.  2. There is a Korea folk museum near the back of the palace, towards the east. It is free with your palace entrance. You can spend anywhere between an hour or two (or more, if you so desire) looking at all of the stuff in there. It is extensive, and there are some pretty cool things in it. I recommend going there, taking a load off, grabbing a drink or snack and getting out of the heat (or cold!) for a little bit.  Overall, if you're going to Seoul, you have to see the Gyeongbokgung. It is large, interesting and inexpensive (like most things in Seoul). Come for the free guided tour for an additional bonus."
674,3.0,"This is a strange place. First of all it had been completely destroyed by the Japanese (and many times before) and they only started reconstructing it in the 1990s - so the entire thing is only about 20 years old (and they are still adding buildings) and completely empty. Secondly it looks like a small Korean copy of the forbidden city in Beijing. With this in mind it is still an interesting visit as it gives an idea how the original palace might have looked like, if you have only time for one place I would recommend Changdeokgung, which is more authentic and imho more beautiful."
675,3.0,"We wanted to tour Changdeokgung Palace on our last day in Seoul, but we learned too late that the only one of the five palaces open on Monday is Gyeongbokgung (which is closed on Tuesdays). So we set out in a steady rain to see what we could see.  We walked from our hotel near N Seoul Tower, maybe a 45 minute stroll. The walk would have been shorter had we known precisely where we were going.  We arrived just as the changing of the guard ceremony was ending, which was pretty cool. Their bright uniforms are impressive, and they replicate the original Josean guards' reds and blues and greens. Their somber countenances are unwavering. They'll permit you to stand close enough to take a photo, but they won't acknowledge you.  Admission is only 3000 won (about $3 US). Though Ggyeongbokgung is older than the other palaces (originally built in 1395), there isn't much left to see because the Japanese intentionally destroyed most of the buildings during the occupation. Restoration only began again in the 1990s. The exterior wall stands, as does the inner courtyard structure and the main palace building, and some smaller outlying buildings.  When it started downpouring rain, we spent some time sitting in the gift shop waiting for it to ease up. They have some really lovely artistic high quality souvenirs for sale, including pottery and inlay jewelry chests and ceramics. They're pretty pricey, but they're not trinkets. You can also buy coffee, hot cocoa, snacks.  Gyeongbokgung is lovely, but it's pretty low key if you've seen palace sites in Bangkok or Beijing. A highlight of our visit was when one of the staff insisted we ""come here"" to see what he was pointing at. You can only see the golden dragon on the ceiling from one vantage point, and he wanted to make sure we saw it and got a good photo. We'd have missed it otherwise.  We were hoping that most of the tour would be inside due to the rain. It wasn't. Because the rain wouldn't let up and our feet were already wet from traipsing across the muddy grounds, we didn't go to the water or explore the rest of the property.  Hopefully Seoul will continue restoration of this site and eventually return it to its original splendor. I'll come back and revisit it."
676,5.0,"The palace grounds are quite large, you could easily spend a half day or whole day exploring. We wandered around for 45 min on our own, but there are almost no signs indicating the history of the building or history. So we decided to take the free English tour. The tour is excellent, the guide takes about an hour and gave us a detailed and heartfelt description of the buildings, cultural significance. The tour is not just about the buildings but explains what was achieved in the buildings such as the creation of the korean language. We felt like we really learned a lot and had a better understanding of the Korean culture and it was Free!  English Tours: 11am, 1.30pm, 3.30pm"
677,3.0,"Directions: Gyeongbokgung station (exit 5) or Gwanghwamun (exit 2). I went from the Gyeongbokgundg station and once you get out of the exit, you will go in from the side door of the palace.  Admission fee: 3000 won (each person)  If you want to know more about the palace, there are free English Tours at the following timings: 11am, 1.30pm, 3.30pm. The duration of the tour is 1hour.  I did not take the tour and we just walked around the premises. The palace is really big. Thus, although there are loads of tour buses, you will not feel that it is very crowded. The instructions are far and few. Maybe it will be good to go for the guided tour or the audio guide.  Although this palace is bigger and more grand than other palaces, i love Changdeokgung better. It is more tranquil and prettier.  Anyway, the changing guard ceremony is held in front of the main gate every hour from 10:00 to 15:00 (i.e. 10am, 11am etc). You can see it as an experience. You can also take photos with the guards.  Overall, if you only have time to go 1 palace, choose Gyeongbokgung if you like big and more grand palace and also to see the changing guard ceremony. Else, I will recommend going Changdeokgung instead."
678,4.0,"Honestly, after seeing so many temples and palaces in Korea, they all start to look the same. The scale of this one sets it apart. The backdrop of mountains makes this one really special too."
679,5.0,"When we went to visit the Gyeongbojgung Palace, there was a fee tour. The tourist guide was very informative and it was a great way of understanding how Korea became great. I was amazed how intricate and grand the palaces were as one gate would unveil its beauty and grandiose majestic sights."
680,5.0,"This palace is in Seoul and very easy to get to, whether you are driving or taking public transportation. We drove and the parking was 3,500 won, about 500 yards from the entrance. Our family paid a total of 7,500 won for the four of us, and that totals 11,000 won for the trip (maybe $9). We spent a few hours walking, reading, taking pictures, and sightseeing throughout the palace grounds. I couldn't believe how many ""buildings"" there are throughout the palace, the highlight for me was the building surrounded by the fish pond, very, relaxing and a great place to sit and relax. There are bathrooms throughout the palace, and even a full blown reenactment ""outside"" (where you don't have to pay yet). We paid and followed the King in through the entrance, the kids loved it. BONUS - You can walk through the palace to the exit opposite of the entrance and see the Presidential Office of the President of Korea, this was pretty cool. Once you've seen enough, you can reenter the palace grounds with your ticket stub. After a few hours at the palace we enjoyed the market across the street. A great day had by the entire family!"
681,5.0,"This is the main palace and it is right in the middle of Seoul. Tickets are cheap. I think it was only $2 or something like that. Make sure to take the guided tour. Once you go past the place where you need to give your tickets, there is an office to the right. You wait outside for the tour guide. Tour times are posted outside the tour guide office as well as the ticket office. The tour lasts about an hour and takes you throughout the palace, explaining various locations and giving a lot of insight and history. The tour made our visit to the palace wonderful and we learned so much! I still can't believe that it was a free tour!  After leaving the palace we walked to Insadong and back to our hotel in Myeongdong. That's how close the palace is to everything."
682,5.0,"This is THE palace in Seoul. If you are there for the culture and history, you have to come here. Also, if you're planning to visit BOTH this palace and Changdeokgung down the street, come here FIRST!! You can get a 2 in 1 ticket deal, but only at the Gyeongbokgung ticket office. Unlike us who went to Changdeokgung first. (Dang it!) The main gate at the front (not where you get your tickets though strangely enough) is very impressive. Although we learned that it was just recently completed as the original was dismantled by the Japanese. The Japanese occupation really did a number on Korean cultural heritage and they're just getting around to finish resurrecting a lot of the structures in the palaces. So, a lot of it is not the original and so not very old at all. Unfortunately, if you go into these palaces without a tour guide it's difficult to get a sense of the history attached to the place even with a pamphlet. This palace is much grander than Changdeokgung. There are also a couple of museums attached to the grounds. Do not miss the Folk Museum!! Excellent!! We didn't have enough time to do a thorough tour of that. Also, found out way too late that we missed a whole section of the palace compound that was used as location for the K-drama ""Rooftop Prince"". (Dang it, again!!) Well, when it's so hot and you have 2 little children and severe jetlag on top of it all, you tend to run out of steam pretty quickly."
683,4.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Royal Palace complex on the north side of downtown Seoul is a marvelous and beautiful site. Meticulously re-built after being destroyed by the Japanese imperial occupation army, the on-going reconstruction is revealing stunning buildings and layers of Korean history. Archeology is on-going, and can be observed during your visit. The gardens and trees are treasures along with the buildings. The small palace at the north-west corner, originally meant to be for the preparation of the dead and a place of mourning, is the best presented of the complex. The restoration is perfect, and being out-of-the-way keeps most visitors far away. It is serene and made for sensitive photography. Even during tourist high season it is not overwhelmed by visitors. he entry fee is so low it is almost free. Be aware that the reason the buildings look so good is that they have largely been re-built since 1989 under a half century plan to restore the entire complex. Almost everything was destroyed by the Japanese imperialists who sought to eradicate Korean history and culture. The fact that most buildings are not original is all that keeps this from being a true five-star attraction. You can walk to the main gate from City Hall."
684,3.0,"The palace will give you an interesting insight into the history of Korea, but this isn't what it appears. Firstly, most of what you see is actually a recreation, built from 1990 onwards. Secondly, the thing it is a recreation of was a reconstruction built in 1867. The original palace was destroyed by the Japanese in 1592...  The English language tour we had was informative, but historically extremely naive. It would appear that the Korean Kings were all paragons of honesty and divine perfection. Forgive me for being suspicious, but I suspect (and history shows) that they were as complex and varied as any humans."
685,4.0,"This palace is actually a reconstruction of the one that used to stand here. The original dates to the Joseon Dynasty. It is only one of several in Seoul, but it was the only one that I had a chance to visit. The architecture and the decorative art inside the buildings were beautiful. As you enter, you can pick up a very thorough pamphlet which explains the purpose of each of the buildings. This was you can tour yourself around and make sure you know what you are looking for at each of the many courtyards. Pamphlets are available in many languages, including English, and are quite informative. Behind the museum is the National Folklore Museum which was well worth the visit alone. You can enter the museum only from the western palace gate. The museum is free of charge, though there is a fee for the palace. The museum gives an excellent overview of the history of people on the Korean peninsula, dating back to prehistoric times. The signs in Gallery 1 all have good English translations, so it is really easy to understand what you are looking at and make sense of the timeline of Korea's past. Gallery 2 consists mostly of artifacts, which are displayed nicely but do not have as much information in English, so I enjoyed this section of the museum less."
686,4.0,"This palace is large and has everything, including impressive buildings and enchanting pavilions. just let your imagination run. excellent with children, who can have breaks (with treats) by the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion pool and at the children museum. No need for a guided tour, and I would skip the unnecessary National Folk Museum of Korea (unless you're aiming for the children museum) and National Palace Museum of Korea. I used the exit through the National Folk Museum, and went up samcheong-ro towards the traditional houses of Hwa-Dong - it's a steep incline that's worth the effort."
687,4.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is truly the crown jewel. Impressive 14c history and site. The entire site is dedicated to the museum. The most impressive part is the views... to the North, beautiful mountain views and the tops of the palace, same as 600 years ago. To the south, the modern skyline.  Changing of the guards, on the hour, is impressive.  The only downside is that the Palace is all recently rebuilt, so the buildings are 'too good to be true'. The restorations are very well done and still definitely worth the visit.  Only 3 USD to enjoy, an extra 1 USD for electronic tour.  Visited June 2013"
688,4.0,"This place is beautiful. I would like to have done a tour, but we visited as a last minute decision. So glad we did. I would recommend a guided tour if you can as we saw groups being guided into areas that others were not allowed to go. And I'm sure there are many stories to be told. The changing of the guards was interesting, and their weapons were something else. Seeing the very modern and chaotic Seoul outside of the palace is such a contrast. We were approached by some very friendly Korean locals who were so charming. Lots of walking to be had, so if you are limited with your abilities, you may want to organise a wheelchair, or accept that you may be limited with what you may see. We went on a sunny day (take sunscreen as there is little shade whilst walking around) and it was just beautiful, but I imagine it would be just as pretty in the middle of winter. Great photo opportunities here.  As a side note... outside the palace a man sold me the best pineapple I have ever eaten in my life!!! It was a slice on a stick and was divine. You may need a napkin handy, as it is sooo juicy."
689,5.0,"Go there early. It can get very hot in the afternoon. The palaces are not lavish but artistic and beautiful. Wish they had more facilities like drinking water fountain, benches etc. Changing guard ceremony is OK. Try pumpkin candy outside. Try taking the college student guides with you."
690,4.0,"what a i love about this place is its location. located strategically in the middle of city, the hustle and bustle city.. so sad to listen their story.. they actually have a hundred building but during the war, it left only 10 building which 2 of the building are still original building. if you need tour guide, just wait in front of the tourist information at 11am for English tour guide. it takes one hour tour around the palace.. please prepare yourself with hat, sunblock, or anything could protect you from the sun.. you can see the changing guard in this palace starts at 10am, it takes 30min.."
691,3.0,"Five six footer tall Korean guard will greet you at the front gate, faces are straight tough looking and their hands holding five different weapons will make you to expect more, and the huge tall gate with dragon designs gave me an excitement to see what's inside but as the time goes by and gets inside the first palace all I saw is green and it's clean, for me it's like park not a palace, but it's good looking park though. My advice is just don't expect more, I'd rather like the look of the small hanok villages than the big palace with nothing inside."
692,5.0,the grandeur and size make it impressive. you may try traditional clothes for free but you must line up for your turn. well worth it.
693,5.0,"Guide books advised us that the gate opening took place at 9am. This is incorrect. The gate opening takes place at 10am. You can catch them warming up at 9.45. It's worth watching though and try to get to the palace early to avoid the crowds. We got there for 9am and we got some lovely photos, tour groups start pouring in from about 9.30am. 11.30am is the first English tour."
694,4.0,"The palace was not too big, 2 hour was enough to spend there. The things I like from this palace was, there were Hanbook rent for free, beside the cafeteria. But had to queue, since many local and tourist used this facility."
695,5.0,"Just use a jacket, long john, and sneakers, and ... you are ready to enjoy Gyeongbokgung Palace in winter. It may provide a slight different experience when we visited Gyeongbokgung Palace in the thickest snow in Seoul history in 2010. It was a little bit chilly, however, it was wonderful seeing the guards hand over ceremony. Do not forget to take pictures by wearing traditional guard costumes for free - a brilliant opportunity."
696,4.0,"Its a very interesting place to visit. Especially if you get there to see the changing of the guards. It shoows you the historical way of the past, and afterwards you are allow to take pictures with the guards once they are in position at their post. I wish I could have seen it in the summer time when the trees and flowers would be at full bloosom."
697,3.0,"It was raining heavily as we get out from the metro station. To make it worse the National Palace Museum is closed. As we enter the side entrance from the museum, we saw the ticket counter and information counter all closed. Quite a number of visitors or tourists seems to be upset coz not allowed by the guard to enter the palace. Maybe it's already closing time. So, advisable to visit this place in the morning."
698,4.0,"This is indeed a nice palace located at the middle of the busy city. It is accessible by Seoul Metro and the palace itself is big and cool enough! There's no need to purchase the ticket and enter the palace, just take some pictures outside the palace is good enough! Don't forget the be there at 10am then you would see the changing guards ceremony for free! After this palace, you can just walk to Samcheong-dong, Bukchon Village and Insadong by walking! Easy!"
699,4.0,"I like the decorations and the buildings, it's a very good palace. and the most amazing part is changing the guards which occurs every hour. No way to visit Seoul without visiting it."
700,4.0,"Wear your rubber shoes during the tour, take the afternoon english tour so it is not too hot. A bit boring after being to Beijing, Tokyo and Cambodia"
701,4.0,"A very good place to show Korea hundred years ago, the buildings are preserved well and impressive.  If you like to take photos definitely this is a good place to go."
702,4.0,There is free hanbok wearing at the souvenir shop which was such a memorable experience! Each person has only 10 minutes to wear the hanbok as the line gets pretty much long. I suggest you go and patiently wait in front of the souvenir shop at lunch time (like what we did) so you get to be first in line when they open up. Ask someone to take your photo standing in front of the nearest palace so you have a great background.
703,5.0,"Despite all the modern advancement of the towns near Gyeongbokgung Palace, this place will never shed its beautiful history. The palace, though standing for centuries, has retained its beauty - from the 5 colors that symbolized korean culture to the detailed structures it has - all perfect and amazing as of this moment."
704,4.0,"I grew up in Korea and was at the Palace about 15 years ago. I remember it to be one boring trip then, since I lived in Seoul.  Two days ago I visited the Palace with a friend from Japan. The Palace was nicely presented, although rather crowded with tourists.  Make sure to check out both new and old museums. Also make sure to visit in the morning around 10am to see traditional Korean music and guards!"
705,3.0,"The changing of the guards is worth seeing. It takes place in a massive empty square and the guards move around it, so you get good views of the whole thing. It's very colourful and makes for good pictures. Besides that, there is not much else to see besides the buildings, and the main gate."
706,5.0,"If I have to compare, I would prefer Deoksugung Palace than Gyeongbokgung palace to visit during holiday. Why? Gyeongbokgung is too crowded since it's the main center of the palace to be visited by the tourists. The main attraction would be the changing of the guards, the history of the palace, the national folk museum and the national museum.  However the last time I came here I can't enjoy it that much since it's very crowded with people. Even the pictures that I took were not as beautiful as ones I took at Deoksugung. Perhaps, one suggestion, come to Gyeongbokgung during weekdays, and not in a spring, winter, or summer break. People are coming not only from Seoul but also China and Japan. I really find it unattractive in a huge commotion like that.  Nevertheless, for 3000won, this area is really worth to visit. This palace area is so huge that even 3 hours will last like a flash. And make sure, you're not coming during holiday. It'll be an awful experience.You can't really enjoy the scenery since it's too noisy and crowded."
707,4.0,A must-visit for first time Seoul visitors. Provides tourists with a glimpse of historical Korea. Get the combined tickets for all the palaces (costs 10000 KRW)
708,5.0,One of the most beautiful palaces in Seoul (Go for this one if you had to visit only one).  The changing of the guards which occurs at 2:00 pm is worth watching.  Take some documentation / map about the palace to understand the history of the place.
709,5.0,"We were there around 2pm, and we were able to watch the changing of the guards. It took around 15 minutes, and guests can go up close to take photos or videos. There are no barriers so you can feel free to take photos.  The palace itself is big and beautiful. We feel this is the most beautiful one of the palaces."
710,4.0,Get the schedule for the ceremony from the Korean website and go watch! It is amazing to watch the guards continue to perform this tradition.
711,5.0,"Changing of the guards, the history and architecture, the gardens and the surrounding mountains all within the modern city of Seoul"
712,5.0,"Absolutely stunning and a must see. You can make your way around the palace and the surrounding neighborhood on foot an enjoy the splendor. Reasonably priced at 3,000 won Try the follk museum too it's free"
713,4.0,"Located in the heart of downtown Seoul, the Gyeonbokgung palace is a must. Not only are tickets dirt cheap, you can also gain access to multiple different sites including the neighboring palace, and the Folk Museum.  Beware though. The palace is closed on Tuesdays. Always check on the website to make sure they are open as they tend to close it down for various reasons."
714,4.0,"Join the free guided tour. Guide was very good, speak very good English and share not only about the palace history but also on other Korean tradition and culture. Tried to catch the change of guard. The museum next to the palace cannot be missed. Entrance to museum is included in the palace ticket."
715,4.0,"There are many palaces in Seoul,and for most you can't visit all of them. So if you have to visit one of these beautiful palaces, I would say it has to be Gyeongbokgung.  It has its beauty and it is HUGE! You can wonder aroundt the palace enjoy sceneries. I recommend to visit the palace during the changing guard ceremony. Which I find it very entertaining and exciting to watch. This is on 11.00, 14.00 and 15.30. You can visit this place at any day but Monday!  TIPS: I went there two times already. In July, it's very HOT! so you may need to bring umbrella along."
716,5.0,"This is one of the palace that you must not miss. Beautifully preserved with rich cultural site. On a sunny day, this place is excellent for taking pictures, very colorful, good view of the mountains. The palace a big place and need a few hours to really enjoy and relax walk to have glimpse of this location. Too bad we missed the changing of guards."
717,5.0,"The 1st royal changing ceremony start about 10.30am and the ceremony is about 10minutes only. Then you can take pictures with the guides..but dont be surprised that they will not smile at all. You still can take pictures with them and outside the palace even you dont but the ticket but to get inside, you have to buy ticket at only 3000won. They are more places to explore inside including korean national folk museum."
718,4.0,"Went here on a balmy, brisk Sunday afternoon in February. Temp was about 10C and the skies were clear and sunny with no wind. Beautiful day!  This was a great to decompress after a long, anxiety filled week.  I didn't know what to expect and a guide would have been nice but is certainly not necessary. It was relaxing to just stroll the ground, looking at all of the buildings and reading the plaques. The architecture is incredible and being there, you can imagine the 14th Century King holding court or strolling by the pond.  There are many benches and places to just sit and take it all in, which we did. We didn't have time to visit the Folk Museum or Palace Museum and will try to see them next time.  We saw the changing of the guards and snapped a few photos - in its own way, its as momentous and magnificent as Buckingham Palace.  Incredible to contrast this incredibly historic spot against what greets you right outside the gates."
719,5.0,"The cultural experience of korea in the heart of Seoul. Easy to get to, v.big, but i wouldnt recommend visiting it in Winter. It gets too cold there and the absence of trees takes away from its beauty."
720,4.0,"Be prepared for a good walk as the palace compound is huge. The former kings must have chosen the place due to its good fengshui as it overlooks a mountain. If you want to know more about Korean history, head onto the museum inside the place which is covered by the entrance fee. There is basically information on how Koreans evolved over the years (i.e costumes, food, handwriting, traditions, etc). Also a good place to enjoy the air-condition after the long walk under the hot sun.  Love the trees and intricate architecture.  Be there before 10 am if you want to witness the changing of guards. The palace is closed every Tuesdays to allow it to be used for filming (presumably Korean period dramas).  As you head out of the palace, cross the road and walk straight for about 50-80 metres and you can find the Museum of King Sejong. TYou won't missed it because there is a huge statue of the King in front of the museum. Though small-scale, it's loaded with information and best of all, it's free. Do watch the short 4-D show to learn how the Koreans fought and won against their enemy with only 1/3 of the battleships. It's so surreal.  On your left after you cross the road as you exit the museum, you will find one of the biggest Starbucks in Seoul which is 4-storey high. A nice way to chill and end your trip to the palace."
721,4.0,"I went to Gyeongbokgung Palace the day after my arrival as I was informed that the palace was a must see in Seoul. It was certainly that. The entrance is a large open area with the palace in front of a serene mountain backdrop. Although not the original construction (rebuilt in late 19th and early 20th century), the buildings attempt to recreate the original design and appear to have achieved that very well. As you walk into the palace grounds you start to see just how massive the location is and the many different buildings it has to offer. I enjoyed the Geunjeongjeon (throne hall) and Gyeonghoeru (pavilion on the water) the most. The Geunjeongjeon holds the most interesting interior and the Gyeonghoeru offers the best spot for pictures. The many other buildings are interesting to look at and you can enter some of them for additional close ups of what the palace may have looked like. I spent a few hours here and that was just about right, which included viewing the changing of the guards which was pretty interesting as they are in traditional dress. The Korean folk museum is worth the charge of admission (free) for a quick walk through, but only advise visiting if you are staying in Seoul for an extended period. The drawback to the palace is the lack of interior in many of the buildings to give a sense of each buildings purpose and also of the daily life of the palace inhabitants."
722,5.0,"I had to do a rush through due to time constraints, but I wish I had a whole afternoon to spend here. This place is HUGE!! When you enter the grounds, you think....this is it. But it just keeps going. Wear comfortable shoes! If you watch historical Korean dramas, you'll really appreciate this place. You'll get a understanding of the whole royal family, servant quarters. Great photo opportunities. Although the kids had no appreciations for it, they loved all the running around they could do."
723,4.0,"We did a three-hour morning tour which included this palace complex. We watched the colourful changing of the guard procession at 10.00am.  The complex contains beautiful ornate buildings set against the majestic mountain backdrop and with a serene man-made lake in the middle.  Unfortunately there wasn’t much to see inside the palace buildings as everything has been removed.  Nevertheless, something not to miss on your Seoul holiday.  Also in the complex is the National Folk Museum of Korea which we were only permitted to pay a fleeting visit to due to time constraints. It looks full of interesting exhibits and will definitely merit a longer visit when we next visit Seoul."
724,4.0,"Worth a visit if you have some extra time. There are many palces in Seoul, so pick one and go. This one is one of the biggest ones, another one to consider is the Changdeokgung Palace, also a big one and that one is a cultural heritage site. The Gyongbokgun Palace took us at least an hour to get around and we could have spent longer. Lots of walking here, be prepared and not in a rush.  This palace I believe closes at 6pm, and the last entry is at 5pm, so get there before then or take pictures from the outside only. It is worth going inside to see more.  The subway exit will be obvious once you get to the right one because the walkway sort of looks like a palace would look only a little more modern. Sorry do not remember which exit number, but all the travel maps will probably be able to tell you which one.  There are gift shops inside this one and the other ones.  Anyway worth a visit, lots of walking, need good walking shoes, refreshed camera battery, etc..."
725,5.0,"This is must stop place. We rented hanboks for the day, so admission was free. The ground were lovely and expansive. Rent an audio tour or just peacefully enjoy the palace."
726,3.0,Nice. Very traditional ceremony. Was there in December. Extremely cold. Good crowd. Make sure you have a guide to explain to you what is going on. Overall was nice
727,5.0,Great palace. I really enjoyed walking around. The Gyeonghoeru (pavilion overlooking the pond) was stunning. Some portions were under renovation during my visit (Dec. 2019) but it was still awesome.
728,5.0,We had a layover in South Korea and decided to take a tour for 5hours and not a moment we regret it. It was a blast. Tour guide was amazing. Food and scenery was lovely.
729,5.0,Beautiful gardens! The gardens was my highlight of Seoul! The tour guide was knowledgeable and communicated the history in a fun and interesting way! Well Done.
730,5.0,The Palace is a piece of history in the quiet setting in downtown Seoul. I dressed as a Palace guard in traditional garb.
731,5.0,Really beautiful palace and gardens. Not to be missed. I took so many good photos here. You will learn a lot about architecture and the royalty during the visit.
732,5.0,My husband and I walked here from Insa-Dong area. The Insa-Dong visitors center was very helpful and provided us a map to the palace. This place was very cool. Cost $6 usd which is very reasonable. There were lots of visitors but it wasn’t so crowded that it made the visit unenjoyable. The museum on the premises is very helpful with providing more information about the palace that isn’t explained on the grounds.
733,5.0,"Very beautiful and historic. Take the time to understand some of the history and try to put yourself in that time. It was so cold the day we visited so we wondered how they kept warm, from the servants all the way up. The artwork on the buildings is beautiful. People dressed in traditional clothing made the experience all the better."
734,5.0,"easy walking, visit king n his work place, his family living room etc. also praying place, dining area n servant living area."
735,5.0,This is a must see place if visiting Seoul. Could have spent a whole day there were it not for limited time. Would love to return.
736,5.0,It was a beautiful place to spend your day walking around this palace. It is clean but no food available. Entrance fee was reasonably cheap. It is near hanbok village. Great experience for my family.
737,5.0,Easy to locate the rental hanbok stall and short 3 mins walk to the palace. Saw the guard changing ceremony. Guards look so cool and good looking! Ha!
738,4.0,"Such a beauty palace and plenty of nice places to take pictures(especially if you have rented a hanbok)! Protip: it cost 3K won to enter the palace but if you wear a hanbok, you get to enter for free!"
739,5.0,The Palace was huge. My family and I went there pretty early to take photos. A must watch is the changing of guards.
740,4.0,"Meticulously reconstructed in the heart of Seoul, this visually impressive site is worth a visit for the crowds of Koreans (and some Chinese) walking around in Korean traditional costumes and for the contrast with the skyscrapers in the background. OK, most of the woodwork is modern, but the actors and the costumes make it quite an experience. Great for western kids."
741,5.0,"It was a great feeling to visit such a well maintained historical place like ""Gyeongbokgung Palace"". Recalling the history by visiting the entire place, palace after palace was eunique."
742,3.0,"We were lucky to visit this place on a sunny winter day. Surprisingly, the place is crowded with tourists and it was a challenge to take pictures in the Korean traditional costume. If one wears the traditional costume, then one can enter the palace for free and there are a lot of lovely spots for photo sessions."
743,5.0,"Amidst the hustle and bustle of the city outside, the palace remained serene and one felt like being transported back in time as it has retained its beauty of long ago. What was most interesting is people walking around wearing the traditional Hanbok added to its charm. It's a must see when in South Korea."
744,5.0,"It is a magnificent building in the middle of a modern buildings. It is easy to locate and nearby got great ginseng chicken soup. If you are not shy, you can rent a hanbok to walk around in the palace. A lot of tourists did that!!!  The place is clean and easy to walk around, there is guides if you need one. Free entrance if you wearing hanbok. Overall is a great place for sightseeing"
745,5.0,Let 's go to Soul. The amazing place that many travellors love to visit. Many youngers with beautiful costume walk around there for taking beautful costumes.
746,4.0,Pretty crowded on weekends but an interesting place to visit for the history and culture aficionados. Palace grounds are huge so expect a fair bit of walking from one attraction to another
747,5.0,"The Palace is definitely worth visiting! To see everything and take photos, you need around 3 hours. We did this around The Changing of the Guards. The changeover is impressive and lasts about 20 minutes. Get into the palace about 140pm for a 2pm changeover, this means you get front row viewing! The clothes they wear are amazing. While there you can see lots of people dressed in traditional hanbok clothing which adds to the experience. You can actually hire the clothes yourself before visiting the Palace."
748,3.0,Not much to see in buildings. There are free english guidances but the english speaking is not very undertandable.
749,5.0,"You must take the free tour but do look at the timing from their website. The tour is about 50min that bring you around the palace and explain history behind each architecture.  Give yourself about 2-3 hours there including the change of guard ceremony (check the timing on their website) should be sufficient. After this, we walked to Bukchon Hanok Village which is about 20-30min walk."
750,3.0,I went to the palace on a whim and it was totally worth it. It’s an awesome experience especially if one visits during the change of guard ceremony. There’s a lot to see at the palace and it offers magnificent photo opportunities. I recommend a visit here for anyone going to Seoul.
751,4.0,"Definitely a place to go specially if you don't have much time to visit Seoul. It will give you an idea of Korean culture. The site is beautiful and you can walk around the parks. Close to the subway, free guides in different languages at set times."
752,4.0,"it gave you glimpse of Korean history good place to visit, clean and very informative when you walk through"
753,5.0,Free entrance to the palace if you wear Hanbok. You can rent Hanbok dress from nearby shop outside the palace. Take as many pictures as you can. It is really fascinating to see other visitors wearing Hanbok as well. It's like in the Dynasty era. The palace is so huge. You can get free English tour guide at the main entrance. Just check the time schedule.
754,5.0,"It happened to be chuseok when I visited so my Daughter and I gained free entrance. It was pretty impressive seeing lots of people, locals and tourist alike wearing the traditional, hanbok outfit. We also managed to watched the elaborate changing of the guard ceremony and then roamed around to admire the palace amazing structures."
755,5.0,"I was not much interested about this place before going to this palace.Once we reached there,I rented an Hanbok for ₩9000/2hrs and hair braid ₩5000.Then that's it,you are ready to capture shots. It was raining heavily when we were there but still it was good.You could hire a guide there so that you will understand the history and culture of that palace.You will find museum which is free entry in the same compound.You can spend around 2hrs in that museum.Overall it was good."
756,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace although had been rebuild is worth visiting and one can definitely marvel at its architecture. Added bonus will be to see the changing of the guards in front of Gwanghwamun, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung at 10:00 am."
757,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace has been likened to the Forbidden City in Beijing but at a more subdued state. I think however that this is a wonderful experience in itself! So come to the palace for its own sake!  A magnificent piece of work, although a replication since the original build if NS have been burnt down by the Japanese except for the chimney and some salvaged beams (in a well-catalogued display) shown in a little hut towards the back of the Palace grounds just before the second palace. Unfortunately the explanation is all in Korean (so the newest Google translate app with the camera function is your best friend here!)  There are complimentary language guides at designated times through the day if you are interested but the information can be found online and at the website rather than the brochure. QR code’s and audio guides should help with the visit.  Oh, do note that if you wear a hanbok, you enter the palace for free!"
758,5.0,A beautiful and great place to go and take photos. The place is full of history and it is a big area to walk around so you must wear comfortable shoes there.
759,4.0,"Seemingly simple, compared to palaces elsewhere, the tour guide was exceptional in providing a history of Korea."
760,5.0,"The change of guards ceremony was interesting and fun to watch. There was quite a lot of people, but not too crowded. A must see attraction in Seoul."
761,5.0,Korean palaces are simple but elegant and this is one of the best. Before you go try and watch a Korean historical drama to put it all in a little context. What makes it special is hundreds of people are dressed up in traditional Korean dress. You get in for free if you do and it certainly livens up the photos
762,4.0,"One of a few royal palaces in Seoul, I think this is the largest. Very interesting architecture. A lot of different sections/parts to see. Can spend a few hours here. They have walking tours in different languages. It's quite a contrast to the modern buildings around it. You can get free entry if you dress up in the Korean national/traditional dress hanbok."
763,5.0,Huge space with lots of historic buildings in a nice garden area. You can walk around and discover things for several hours. If you rent traditional cloths you can get in for free. Normal fee is 3.000 for adults an 1.500 for kids above. Don't miss the guard changing ceremony at 10am. Be there 10 minuits before to get a good spot for watching. Dont miss the national folk museum right next to the palace garden.
764,5.0,rented the hanbok to capture photos with the palace as the background. beautiful and well kept palace with many great spots to take photos. the palace and its compound was huge.
765,4.0,This palace is middle of city. Big and we can hire the Korean traditional clothing here and around here. Enter fee was W3000-W5000. When you are in Seoul see this place. One thing this palace is so busy..so many peoples are here!!!
766,5.0,"The breathtaking views and amazingly well kept palaces and grounds made it seem like I was back in ancient times.  You can spend an entire day sitting in front of the clear lake watching the large golden fish swim by as you drink your coffee, or walk the paths along the green lush background as you enter different parts of the palace.  A great way to thoroughly enjoy this palace is to emerge yourself into the culture! If you rent a traditional Hanbok (tradition korean dress) admission into the palace is free. I’m sure the rental of the outfit is more than the palace admission but let’s face it, we travel for the experience!  A definite must see!"
767,5.0,"It's a huge area and in the middle of the city. I had rented a traditional Korean dress from near by store...hence, the entrance fee was waived because of that. It has a long history. Wear comfortable shoes as you have to go around wide area. It's a fun place to take pictures with the palace and Korean dress."
768,5.0,The palace design is amazing. The craftsmanship needed to to design and build it just blows my mind. We wore the Hombaks (traditional dress) to get free admission. It was a beautiful experience and a walk back in time.
769,4.0,"Still my favorite palace to visit Seoul after having done Changdeokgung, changyeunggung & deoksokgung.  Dont forget to also watch the guard-changing ceremony, Royal palace museum & national folk museum (including the outdoor exhibits), which are ""outside"" the palace perimeter but just outside the gates. And free to visit."
770,4.0,Palace that has interesting history. Most of the original palace buildings have been destroyed. Few have been preserved and some rebuilt. Guard changing ceremony is the interesting part and the guards try to stay still but you could see their eyes wandering and enjoy the giggles from visiting tourists
771,5.0,"I would say this is the largest and most grand palace in Seoul. The grounds are enormous with much to see. We went in the morning to see the changing of the guards, which my kids found fascinating. They even had a roped off section for children to sit so they could see better. If you could only see one palace this is the one."
772,5.0,One of the most beautiful parts of Seoul. Among the restored buildings you can see what life was like in the old days. I recommend you go early because after 12 noon there are plenty of photo tourists.
773,5.0,"We did what many tourists did, which is to rent the hanbok or traditional Korean costume for a few hours and walk around the palace. Note that if you are dressed in hanbok, you can enter the palace for free although it will still cost you more to rent the hanbok than the entrance fee.  The palace is large and it took us at least a couple of hours to walk around, taking photos and watching the change of guard ceremony.  Note that the change of guard ceremony takes place once in the morning and another time to in the afternoon. Try to catch it if you can as it is quite elaborate and there is an English explanation of the ceremony over the PA system."
774,4.0,"Had a very good time in the Gyeongbokung place, the place you must visit if you are travel to South Korea, you can get more information from the museum, Morning time is good. you can dress handbok and spend time on the premises with that outfit."
775,5.0,"I had a nice, peaceful visit to this place. It is vast and has many palaces to see. I walked around and saw many trees, flowers, and places to sit. The signs are in Korean and English and give history on each of the buildings. This is a fabulous place to take a stroll through. I enjoyed it immensely."
776,5.0,"Had a really enjoyable day here, looking around the place and all it’s surrounding, must see all the places when in Seoul."
777,5.0,Surprising and a magnificent view at the lake in the winter. I usually come to this palace in the spring and fall time. But this time I had some friends visiting from overseas so I embraced the cold to show them the palace. Not a hint of disappointment.  Pretty cold to wear Hanbok but the picture well worth it.
778,4.0,"The oldest and biggest palace in Seoul. It is very near to Gyeongbokgung Station. It tells the history of Joseon kings and their life and rule. It is a must-see when visiting Seoul. Admission is 3000 won per pax. However, it is free entry for visitors wearing hanbok, senior citizens aged 65 and above and every last Wednesday of the month, it is free entry for all. Daily changing of guards is at 11am and 2pm. However, it could be cancelled due to special events. In addition , the National Palace Museum of Korea has a great collection of art and archival materials over 500 years of history from the Joseon Dynasty to the Korean Empire. It is in the vicinity of the palace and admission is free too. While visiting this palace, many visitors would find their way to eat the famous ginseng chicken soup at Tosokchon Restaurant or eat at Tongin Market which uses traditional coins for food purchase. The overall experience is one stone hit many birds."
779,5.0,"Before visiting the palace I went into the free museum which is situated inside the walls of the palace, beautiful inside. You pay for tickets at a small booth very reasonable price, once inside all I can say is stunning"
780,5.0,We really enjoyed walking about the palace and learning some of the history. The dynasty and royalty is fascinating and the structures are beautiful.
781,4.0,"If you ignore the whole place was rebuilt not long ago and hence isn't particularly original (although, of course, rebuilt in its impressive, historical, form) it is definitely worth seeing. Sprawling, busy and imposing it is a must when visiting Seoul."
782,4.0,"Very nice place to visit while in Seoul. Historical site, not to crowded. Spend nice time there. Recomend it for everyone visiting even if they have little time. However is not worth to wait for the change of guards."
783,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace was the royal palace of Joseon dynasty. Our tour guide, Erica, gave a detailed history of this dynasty and the sons fought with each other to occupy the throne and that lead to the construction of the other main palace. She explained about the summer and winter offices and rooms considering how hot and cold the temperature reaches during theses season in South Korea. Also, the change of guards is one of the major attractions of this palace. Don't miss it. Must visit."
784,5.0,"An amazing, sprawling site you have to visit in Seoul. Get there by 10am on a weekday and you'll have a perfect view for the changing of the guard. it's an awesome show. Rent a traditional hanbok at a shop nearby, get in free and supercharge your instagram, yo."
785,5.0,"Since we booked a nearby hostel, it was just a good walk from our place. The palaces are quite interesting which gives you an idea of how they used to lived during the old times. It was a good thing that it was not crowded when we visited so we really enjoyed the beauty of the place."
786,5.0,Gyeongbokgung Palace itself was easy to find! (Stop at gyeongbokgung station). Rent a hanbok and you are able to enter for free !! I must say the palace is big and beautiful😍 As for me i really want to visit the palace as i always seen it on tv so seeing it in real life is amazing! Its big that you need 2 hours to explore the whole area and there’s alot of pretty spots where you can take photos with your hanbok!! Definitely recommend to visit with your hanbok because you’ll feel like you are a princess/prince!! But of course there will be alot of tourist so come early so there not much people!
787,5.0,"If you're coming to Seoul, this place is a must see. The grounds are huge so be prepared to do a lot of walking. The view of the mountains is very majestic. You can rent a hanbok in nearby shops so you can enter for free which i highly recommend if you really want that Korean feel during your tour and take nice pictures in centuries old architecture."
788,4.0,We came here on a cloudy day and didn’t choose to go deep into the palace compounds by paying an entrance fee. Tourists were soaking in the atmosphere with their rented hanboks.
789,5.0,Nice and worthwhile visit to the best palace complex of the city.. Try to have a sunset visit that will give you a unique and less crowded experience
790,5.0,The interesting thing about the visit was we had to dress the traditional hanbok or Chosŏn-ot and visit the palace. We were lucky to arrive during the changing of the guards at 4 p.m. The changing of the guards are done twice a day in the mornings and evenings.
791,5.0,"Free English and Korean tours available, usually 1.5 hour long. Three times a day, last is at 330pm or so. This was on a Sunday for us. I recommend the tour guides bc it makes seeing the building and at different aspects more enjoyable and knowing their history is a plus.  Admission is 3000 won/ adult. Credit card accepted. You can rent traditional clothing and get free admission, rental rates is cheaper as you get further from the palace. Usually 10000 won nearby the palace. Folk museum is right next door and free admission."
792,5.0,"Beautiful place, definitely a place to visit with family, we got to know and understood a lot of the wonderful Korean culture."
793,4.0,Getting into the Gyeongbokgung Palace brings you back to the ancient scenes of Korea and makes you understand more their culture and history.
794,5.0,"I went by myself via the subway, which was very safe and interesting. The palace a short walk from the stop. I timed my arrival with the changing of the guard. I spent 2-3 hours here, wandering about and taking photos. The numerous costumed guests afforded me great shots as they posed, ran, or peaked out. The entry fee was reasonable. I'm happy tourists are allowed to view the grounds.  Afterwards, I walked around the area and saw a huge protest at Gwanghwamun Square, which is a gathering place in front of the palace. I was told there something going on there almost daily. A further bit down the road and I ran into a Starbucks and then on to the tourist information center, where they were very helpful. I need an SD card for my phone and they called the nearby bookstore and inquired if they did indeed sell the cards as I had been told. I then walked across the street, to the bookstore, and discovered that it is nothing like I would know in the USA. They sell all manner of things inside that store. It was very interesting there too. This area is a must-see!"
795,4.0,Interesting visit to the palace. Lots of other tourists in rented Hanboks to make the place more fun to visit.  It would have been better with more signage to share more about the different areas of the palace and its history.  Else it’s a nice stroll that takes about 2-3 hours. Nice shopping and food surrounding the palace too.
796,5.0,This historical place gives wonderful Korean experience. Lot of people wear Korean dress ( that gives free entry) and walk around. Many of photo sports. One can take free guided tours on specific times. A must see place if you visit Seoul.
797,5.0,"We joined the free English tour, which was really excellent, informative and entertaining. If you come in traditional costume, the entrance fee is waived, but it was summer, so our hosts opted for the cooler choice of paying for the tickets. We were thankful!! Plenty of photo opps, beautiful grounds and buildings, fascinating history."
798,4.0,Royal Guard Changing Ceremony at Gyeongbokgung Palace was very interesting. Royal guard ware traditional cloth. Please check schedule for this ceremony!!
799,5.0,"Even though this is all reconstruction, it's a pleasant view into the past. As most of Korea was devastated by war, we were thrilled that this complex has been recreated. On the day of our visit, a Sunday, we were treated to scores of folks in traditional Korea dress which only added greatly to the charm. We spent approximately two hours strolling through the grounds and enjoyed it immensely. It was well worth the visit!"
800,5.0,This is one of the sites within Seoul that you actually get a sense what the early Korean architecture and culture would have been like in the 1400s and later. Much of the country was later destroyed in various wars. It is very photogenic as many locals rent historical costumes to wear while they visit the palace. The palace covers a large area and you should count on at least an hour to walk and explore the grounds.
801,5.0,"Feel the greatness when Korea was a great kingdom a long time ago. There are many sites in here to walk and a very wide area. The ticket is 3,000 KRW (2019) for one person or you can visit several palaces (not only Gyeongbokgung) with another type of tickets. Don't forget to go to Tosokchon to taste the original Samgyetang (Ginseng Chicken Soup) in the left side of this palace, or Bukchon Hanok Village in the right side."
802,5.0,A really great day out with English speaking tours! There was so much to see and learn about and we were lucky enough to visit whilst a guard ceremony was taking place.
803,4.0,"Easily accessible in Seoul, gorgeous Palace, cheap to get in, look for traditional events on evening."
804,5.0,"Dreaded going to this place as Im not a fan of historical sites but this was so different and a lot of fun! It was a pleasant surprise. Firstly, we rented hanboks from one of the many hanbok rental shops (10,000 won for 2 hours) really near the palace, it was fun choosing and coordinating the colours. And then we got to enter the palace for free because of our hanbok attire. It was a great experience to see this historical landmark and wear traditional korean clothes! Totally brought us back in time and felt so in character. P.s: It was in summer and wearing the hanboks made us feel warmer than ideal. Haha."
805,5.0,"The entire palace grounds is huge as it houses 2 museums and numerous restored buildings within. The complimentary guided tour was quite informative and interesting. There are still many buildings yet to be restored and the government has been making good effort into the restoration of this palace back to its glory. It would be interesting to go again when there are more buildings. The two museums within its grounds are free to enter. The Royal Palace Museum is definitely a must if you would like to catch a glimpse into the past and the lives of those who used to live in Gyeongbukgung. This palace along with Changdeokgung, Changyeonggung, Deoksugung, the Secret Garden and Jongmyo Shrine are included in the Royal Palace Pass at 10,000 won. Really good deal."
806,5.0,"Located in the center of Seoul, conveniently accessible by subway. A lot of people, local girls in national costumes. On the territory there is a museum of royal life. If you go to the end of the complex, you can go to the presidential palace. Also, there is an art crafts museum nearby, very interesting!"
807,4.0,"This is a very interesting place, but if you don't like walking a lot, it is a place to avoid! The stones you mostly walk on are uneven and it can be very tiring and hard on the legs and feet."
808,5.0,"if you wear a hanbok, you get in free! there were many, many people wearing gorgous hanboks with their sig others graciously taking pics of them. great photo op with you in the traditional dress of korea. it's a very large area to walk around so never felt crowded even though there was quite a crowd there on a warm summer afternoon. exiting is difficult however we did find another one toward the history museum/hanok areas."
809,5.0,"No exaggeration, you could easily spend 4-5 hours roaming the palace grounds. It's absolutely massive and full of things to explore. Great photo ops all over as well. Normally there's an entrance fee, but I went last week and didn't have to pay anything. One thing to note, when they say it closes at 6, they mean your butt better be out by 6. Those guards do not play at all, lol."
810,5.0,"This was the very first place we wanted to visit when coming to Seoul. We took the opportunity to rent traditional hanboks in one of the numerous shops longing the palace, so the entrance was free (if you don't rent one, then you must pay the entrance ticket). A walk in the palace took us a good two hours, it is even bigger than we thought when looking at it from outside. It feels quite magical when you're interested in Korean culture, even more when lots of visitors are wearing hanboks themselves. There are a lot of spots to take pictures, sometimes you might meet Korean people asking to take a picture with you!  You cannot go inside the palace though, you can check what's inside from the windows. But it was overall a really good visit and we felt really involved thanks to the outfits. I recommend renting a hanbok to visit, it doesn't feel the same than when you wear your own clothes!"
811,3.0,Beautiful place and big complex. I visited the place with my parents and it is difficult to find toilets around
812,5.0,A beautiful palace to visit - not as busy in the morning so I recommend going as early as you can when there are no ticket queues. We got there by about 10:30-10:45am and left by 12 and it was heaving - long queues. Lovely to see people walking around dressed in traditional outfits that they had rented. The areas surrounded by water are the most beautiful to see.
813,4.0,Loved visiting this palace and it’s extensive grounds! Would be lovely to visit when weather is a little cooler as it is all outdoors. So historic and loved seeing people dressed in traditional clothing (hanbok).
814,4.0,If you dress traditional you don’t need to pay the entry. You can rent a dress in houses next to the palace. And have a photo shoot. Really great! 50% is dressed like that. With makes it like you are in history....flash back.
815,5.0,"I love history and it was amazing to visit the grand and amazing Gyeongbokgung Palace. Experience the changing of the guard ceremonies at the main entrance Gwanghwamun, the museums, ornamental gardens and some of Seoul's grandest architectural sights. Rent a Hanbook and besides getting free admission into the grounds with it, look good in your pics with the traditional Korean costume. Lots of culture and beauty in store here, like Gyotaejeon Hall and Amisan Garden, Gyeonghoeru Pavilion, Hyangwonjeong Pavilion, Sinmumun Gate, etc. Wear comfortable shoes for walking ....."
816,4.0,"This historical palace is not to be missed when you are in Korea. We enjoyed walking in the grounds of the palace in our hanbok. You can sense the grandeur of the place during its time. Also, we were lucky enough to witness the changing of the guards ceremony."
817,5.0,A history of Korean empire with. Beautiful architecture and surrounded by beautiful greenery.the cafeteria sitting place is very cute with wooden huts.
818,5.0,An Amazing Palace. You must see the guard change ans the Big garden. If you want all things to see you need a lot of time
819,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung palace was an amazing experience!!! To be submerged in korea's rich history and its tradition, i got to see alot of colorful hanboks(traditional korean clothing) and the amazing architecture surrounding the palace, the palace is huge, with alot of greeny and seats available for it's visitors, there are also bathroom facilities around the palace, although refrain from smoking! The palace also holds a Musuem, and in it a café and some gifts shops,you can also find an area of a very old 80's-town almost as if it got frozen in time, there are so many Hotspots to take selfies and photos so sometimes it can be over crowded but nonetheless the scenery is absolutely beautiful and to be in the presence of the palace was magical!!!! I felt i was reliving history"
820,4.0,"The place was beautiful and historic. We saw a guard changing ceremony and it was amazing 👍🏻 . There was a hanbok renting, but we decided that it was a too hot weather to rent a hanbok, so we rent a hanbok in Bukchon Hanok Village (see review of Bukchon Hanok Village). We took some beautiful pictures. Overall it was beautiful and historic."
821,5.0,This is a gorgeous Palace in downtown Seoul. Most of it has been rebuilt but it is historically accurate. Many people rent traditional clothes just outside the gate and then get in free to see the palace. We did not dress up as June in Korea is so hot. The palace itself is lovely to look at and you need about two hours to see it. Unfortunately you can't go inside any of the buildings; if you could it would really enhance the experience.
822,4.0,Love that it’s in the middle of city. Outside the walls is modern Korea. We were able to witness the exchange guards which was on Monday morning. Entrance is free if you wear traditional clothing which you can rent nearby stores.
823,5.0,"During our stay in Seoul we went to visit this palace twice. The changing of the guards is wonderful with the instruments, precision and clothes. We enjoyed learning about the history of the kings of South Korea."
824,4.0,As I was travelling for business I did not have much time to sight see. My colleague took me to the palace to breathe in some Korean heritage. It was a lovely experience and I learned a lot about Korean history in a short (1 hour) time. Glad I didn't miss out!
825,4.0,"We went on a Thursday morning in May and it was not too crowded. This is the largest of the Seoul palaces and there is much to see in this restored palace compound. The changing of the guard ceremony is in the area where the tickets are sold and happens at 10:00 and 2:00. It is quite colorful and is more than just a changing of the guard. Inside the grounds is the National Folk Museum and it is included with the palace admission. It also is a large space and we only got half way through. One could really spend a lot of time in this palace area. For us, a half day was enough but it was quite nice."
826,5.0,"If you are a first time visitor to Seoul, this place is a must. Rent a hanbok (traditional Korean outfit) from nearby venders around the palace and be a Korean for a day. I personally think everyone looks good in hanbok. There are free English tour of the palace and it is well worth your time if you want to get a glimpse of Korean history, politics and culture.  Don’t miss the changing of the guards ceremony and this place have very festive and positive vibe."
827,5.0,What else should be explained? All tourists must go to this place if they visit Seoul for the first time. Do not miss 'Changing of the Royal Guard' ceremony when you visit here.
828,5.0,"This is a very beautiful palace, easy to stroll around, with many people dressed in traditional clothes adding to the charm of our photos. The changing of the guard is very simply done but with great honor and punctuality. Sadly, the tourists are all over the place and hardly notice this important tradition, but I am very pleased to have witnessed it. My only wish is that each building have a sign, in English (and other languages) to describe it's purpose. That would be a very useful addition."
829,5.0,"A nice walk amongst the buildings of the main Seoul palace. The main problems that I faced while in Seoul are the following : A) if you have been in one palace, then they all look alike, B) they are not the actual buildings they have been restored or completely built from scratch. Still the amount of work and maintenance is astonishing. Also nice if you are there to watch the guards change which is also explained in English. Quite huge walk and might have helped taking the English tour which is available free thrice a day. But on the other hand, not sure if I could have stayed with the tour for the whole 20+ buildings. If you are going in the palace on a sunny summer day of Seoul, do make sure to have a fan (hand fan, battery fan, etc) and some shade provider (hat, umbrella, etc)."
830,5.0,"So serene and beautiful. Tons of foreigners wearing rented hanbok were fun made the dusty grounds very colorful and complimented the gorgeous buildings. Wonderful history lesson. The folk museum is right next door, too. Also well worth it."
831,5.0,"The views are amazing !! Good exposure to local tradition and heritage. You must wear a HANBOK! go for the theme hanbok which you can get for approx 30$ You get free entrance to the palace of you do so, but it makes you feel like your in a movie or in a princess movie"
832,5.0,Place to learn korean royal family Outdoor activity bring umbrella Good to see people wearing hanbok 3000 won for admission
833,5.0,This is a great Palace to visit. Palace's history and architecture are great. Visit early in the morning to avoid the heat and crowds.
834,4.0,"go with hanbok, then you don't have to pay for the entrance fee. yes, although the fee is cheaper than renting a hanbok, i think you'll feel more in place with hanbok - since many are also wearing them! the place is beautiful, although you might need more time to walk everything - but 2 hours is suffice for phototaking!"
835,5.0,It is within walking distance from our hotel. Vast area and interesting place for a visit. Hop on hop off bus goes to this place.
836,5.0,"The “military training” at 9.30 was cancelled because it was muddy. But the kids enjoyed seeing the procession. If u arrive at the area early enough like 8.30, u might hv time to explore the Hanbok rental shops that might be open and dress up before the procession.  Note that the ground is not very stroller friendly."
837,5.0,"Take a whole day to explore this impressive place. There are so many different parts you can wander for ages. Kids can run free to their heart's content which is an extra if you are travelling with children. Make sure to see the change of the guards ( a few times a day). Gyeongbokgung palace is located in the center of Seoul and easy to acces. Bukchon Hanok Village, Insadong and Cheonggyecheon are in walking distance."
838,4.0,A very lovely and historic place. Full of wonderful images and architecture this is a must as are the other Palaces of Seoul
839,5.0,"Rather impressive and you can wander for ages. Would be a great place to let the kids run. Be warned, not much in washroom facilities. Could be improved be have period enactors."
840,5.0,"there's 2 different areas and both charge you 3k won each, though it is really worth it, or way better. especially garden and pond area was great, must see place in Seoul"
841,5.0,When you visit this palace make sure to be there in the morning to see the change of the guards at 10.00 - then take enoug htime to explore all the different bulidings it has to offer. Crowded place but worth it.
842,4.0,"If you’re into history then this place is a must see, if you’re not then you’re better off visiting somewhere else. Tour guides will be provided if you’re keen on knowing more about the history of the place on a timed basis. If you’re visiting on summer, prepare some shades or else you will be fried by the hot summer sun. There are some spots that will only open a few times a day, so if you want to visit a particular area, get your schedule right before visiting."
843,4.0,We visited this palace. This is by far the biggest palace so be prepared to walk a reasonable distance to cover most of the area. A lot of the buildings are very similar in style and it is interesting from a historical view. There was a changing of the guard which was colorful. Take a bottle of water as there are only a couple of places in the palace compound to get drinks. Worth the visit.
844,4.0,This was built 6 centuries ago and is a really impressive palace in the centre of Seoul. The place is huge and can get quite sunny with little shade so don’t forget suncream and water. There are guards at the gate to look at and pose for photos with. We joined a free guided tour in English which started at 1:30 (they have some more but unsure on the times). This was really useful to tell us about each palace building and point out things you may have missed otherwise. It was hard to believe this is right in the middle of the city! Huge open space with big lavish palace buildings.
845,5.0,Nice and ancient grand palace of Joseon Dynasty of South Korea. There are more other palace that should be visited.
846,5.0,A must go if you are a history addict! The museum offers free english guided tours at selected timings and the guide is very informative and lovely!  Try to go before 9 am to get the tickets and roam around before the first english guided tour at 1030 to avoid the scorching hot sun later in the day during summer. The palace gets rather crowded and becomes difficult to take a good photo without other tourists in it.  The palace is very well maintained and many areas worth exploring after the tour. One of the perks of wearing the Hanbok to the palace is that you get free entrance into all the palaces. Do note that this palace is close on Tuesdays.
847,4.0,"Still one of the places to visit when you are in Seoul. The palace is so intricately made and the mountain at the back is so amazing. However, it is so big but there is only 1 or 2 toilets nearby."
848,3.0,Very clean area and can get very crowded during weekends. Good for photo shoots.  Entrance is free. If you want to rent the Korean traditional costumes it is readily available near the palace before entry and very cheap as well.
849,4.0,If you are looking to see a bit of history in Seoul the palace is worth a visit. Make sure to be there for the changing of the guard at 2pm. The Palace museum next to the actual palace is also very interesting.
850,5.0,To get the full appreciation of the site one needs to walk through the entire grounds and visit the museum. The Palace really shows a lot of Korean culture. We ran into a few groups of Korean students outside the Palace which put us in the right mood from the beginning.
851,5.0,"Must see buildings, water garden, and crowds all dressed in traditional Korean costumes. Enjoy the Folk Museum within."
852,4.0,"We arrived at about 10am and found out that there is a free english tour at 11am. So, after walking around a bit, enjoying the view, we waited for the tour. There was about 30pax waiting for the tour to start. A lady dressed in a lovely hanbok gave us a tour. We enjoyed the tour a lot because the information provided about the palace were very interesting. You will appreciate the palace structure, architecture and culture better. The walking tour took 1 hr and after that, we were free to roam around the palace. Very enjoyable tour, highly recommended!"
853,4.0,"My traveling to south korean finally completed by visit palace. A very great experience to enter the palace wearing hanbok, felt like a princess for a day. This palace has a huge areas, hence it might be exhausted to look around yet so fun. So guys if you have chance to come to korea, you must be come here."
854,3.0,"Beautiful traditional palace of the last ruling dynasty. The free guided tour was great with explanation on the architecture, history and culture. Recommend doing it at the beginning if your trip."
855,5.0,"This place is huge and it's a maze inside. But it's fun to walk around and especially the pavillion on the water looks great. It was really crowded, though."
856,4.0,"Being one of the prominent sites for tourists, Gyeonbokgung can get very busy. Try to time your visit to see the changing of the guard - it's actually quite impressive. There is no charge to watch the changing of the guard, but if you want to go inside the palace there is a small (not unreasonable) fee. Make sure you find a spot in the crowds near to the roped off area so that you can see what's going on. The palace grounds are vast. After visiting the buildings closest to the entrance, keep walking to see all the buildings behind. You'll find you get right away from the bulk of the crowds and can better enjoy the ambience of the place."
857,5.0,"This palace is one of the best ""parks"" to walk on a spring daytime. Good architecture and nature combined."
858,5.0,"We visited the place around 1:45 pm just before the changing of the guard at 2pm. This is amazing old meets new experience. There are many ladies dressed up in their Hanbok and they make the place come alive.  The entry to the place is free. It’s great for children, couples and single travellers. It’s a total must see on your visit to Seoul.  Wear comfortable shoes, be prepared to walk on uneven ground, and make sure you are there before the changing of the guards at 2pm.  If you want a total Korean experience you can rent a hanbok and look like a total tourist! It’s a fun experience and I recommend it!"
859,4.0,Palace within palace which for this palace there is chinese character written around it and kinda confuse me but still a great place to spend time and taking memories down the road by wearing their costumes which can be rented
860,5.0,"This was a lovely (and cheap) way to spend a few hours. The palace and grounds are huge. Once you get away from the main palace and start to explore the grounds, the crowds of people almost disappear and it is beautiful. I liked this palace better than Changdeokgung, even though people rave about how great Changdeokgung is...I preferred Gyeongbokgung overall. One of the best things to do in Seoul in my opinion."
861,5.0,"This a beautiful ""must see"" place to visit located in the middle of the city. Very interesting to learn about Korean history in the museum and all the houses on the grounds. Also very nice to see people dressed up in the traditional Hanbok clothing that could be rented outside the palace to give you free entrance."
862,4.0,"Beautiful palace in the heart of downtown bustling Seoul. Very beautiful grounds but EXTREMELY CROWDED and offputting because of that. Changing of the guard is twice per day and ceremonial, rather staged and tacky in my opinion but attracts huge crowds as well. If you're in Seoul it's a must see tourist attraction...but keep in mind, emphasis on the word TOURIST! And plenty of them!"
863,4.0,A must visit attraction when in Seoul this attraction is busy with visitors everyday. One has to queue to buy tickets and this can be uncomfortably cold in March and April. Do note that seniors get free entrance - do show your passport to get your complimentary tickets into the palace ground. The foot ways are uneven and one must be sure footed to prevent any tripping. One can see many people in rented period Korean costumes around the palace ground. Do rent one if you fancy taking photos with the palace in the background (but then there may be many people in the background too).
864,3.0,"Lovely palace grounds. But they could benefit from more exhibits. The area appears big, but could be completed within a 30min walkthrough."
865,5.0,"I came here from Chunjeongno Stn, commuting a public bus. It took me only 20 minutes to arrive here. wonderful place. entrance fee just 3000 krw per person but If you rent their Hanbok , you will get a free entrance. Goodlucl"
866,5.0,"We got there by taxi and realized that because of its central location many other attractions were within walking distance. The queues were long for the entrance tickets and some people approached us offering Hanbok rentals since wearing one grants you free entrance to the cultural attractions. The rental wasn't worth it considering the starting price was 10,000 won while the entrance only cost 3,000 won. If you're going to +3 places that have entrance fees then it might be worth it there's also a penalty for late returns. Inside the Palace we saw tons of cherry blossoms in full bloom. We rushed to the front entrance when we heard the drums for the changing of the guards but we couldn't properly appreciate it since the crowd was huge and we could only watch from a distance."
867,4.0,"We went with a youth guide who we met while exiting the metro station. He gave us a nice tour of the place lasting almost 2 hrs. Crowds aplenty, many were dressed in traditional costumes from one of the many shops nearby. Do catch the changing of the guard."
868,4.0,"Arrived here at 2 pm and very crowded because many visitors from locals and foreigner. Cost me 3000 Won per person (free of charge for people using hanbok). There's a guardian changing ceremony at 10 am and 2 pm. But it's not a real guardian, only some actor (but they do it very very serious and nice to watch).  This palace is very large, but never empty of visitors since it's the main palace. Oh good thing is this object provide free locker where we can put our bag. It's located near from the entrance.  Many people come here using hanbok (traditional clothes from Korea). Surely can take beautiful photos here."
869,5.0,"We arrived here in time for the 11am English speaking guided tour of the palace and its grounds. Super impressive!! The tour goes for about an hour and covers a lot of the history of the sight and the buildings along with their uses. Our guide spoke good English, so you’ll have no trouble learning something from the tour. In addition to the tour, you’re free to walk the grounds for as long as you want, something totally worth doing!"
870,5.0,This day a lot of tourists love to wear Hanbok dress ( the Korean traditional dress) if you wear Hanbok no entrance fee to enter the palace. If you go there in the Autumn you will see some color change very pretty. One day out of the month is free to enter (Every last Wednesday of the month don't forget to bring your passport) Even citizen less than 24-year-old and people who are 65 years old and up are fee enter. Don't for get to check National folk museum of Korea.
871,5.0,Our second time to visit this palace and caught the Changing of the Guard which is a great ceremony to watch. The palace area is huge so you have to be ready to walk but on a nice spring day it was quite pleasant and breathtaking.
872,4.0,"Actually my 3rd visit . But this time , there is the norm to wear their traditional attire , and the entrance to the palace would be free. If you want the more good quality hanbok it is either you rent or just buy. In doing so , the government was able to highlight their culture . Many would love doing their photo ops for social media motives. Place is huge , so just causally move around . By the way , at the start of the tour is the changing of the guard . But being late in the rental leaves you with the least desired among the traditional clothes."
873,5.0,"With a group of people who rent hanbok, we entered this palace and it's free if you wear hanbok (Korean Traditional Dress). This is the 2nd time I have visited here. The palace is so big, and we didn't get to walk around much area. It's unique that you wear hanbok and take photos in here, seems like you are really living here. You have to experience it at least once."
874,2.0,"When I first visited the palace in 2002, I was really in awe of the beautiful structures and the history of the site. During my last visit with my family, I ended up completely annoyed and found myself hurrying through the palace. The palace is now overrun by tourists that rent hanboks and are only interested in taking their posed photos, without appreciating the beauty and history of Gyeongbokgung. Maybe this doesn't bother you, but the experience was ruined for us.  I would recommend going straight to the National Folk Museum first, and then making your way through the palace. I wish that we had done it that way."
875,4.0,"You must visit ALL the local palaces, they are very inexpensive (1,000 won) and you get to see some cool history. I especially loved seeing all the people in authentic dress, by the way you can rent an outfit and you get free entry to any palace."
876,5.0,It was an amazing view to visit this palace and to admire the historical story behind was really mesmerizing. The building was neatly maintained and clean. There is a museum inside which is very much interesting to see.
877,5.0,"If you are interested both history and scenery, this is the place to go. At 11am you will be able to witness the guard changing at the front of the palace. Besides that, you are also able to do traditional rental dress at the nearby village. At Spring time, there are lots of sakura flowers around the palace area. Walk further in at the nearby museum, if you are lucky there will be some performances"
878,4.0,It is amazing how they have rebuilt all Palaces and other buildings that were burned down along time ago. Must have cost a fortuna and they are still rebuilding . Use a guide to inform you.
879,5.0,"We were fortunate to visit here while the guards were being changed and the ceremony exceeds any other such ceremony that one typically can witness. Much grander of a scale, much more pageantry.  But even if you don't get to see that take place, the Palace grounds and buildings are impressive enough to warrant a visit here for sure."
880,4.0,"Great palace to see, clean and interesting. Great place to take photos & learn about Korean history! Must visit in Seoul. Only $3,000 Won per person"
881,4.0,"A beautiful palace, which unfortunately got caught in a fire in the 1800’s then was ruled by the Japanese for about 50 years. The Japanese tore it all down but fortunately stored a lot of the structures. They have spent the last 30 years, restoring and repair the palace, so not much of it looks very old but it is amazing when you read the history. The changing of the guard is a nice ceremony to watch. It is great to visit during cherry blossom as it all looks so pretty."
882,5.0,This palace is a great Korean historic site and a place that every tourist should visit. It is also the main palace in Seoul.
883,4.0,"Like many of sites in Seoul a lot of the place was destroyed by the Japanese, A lot has been rebuilt to the original architecture, Only down side 95% of the buildings are empty, so gets a bit boring just look at the outside walls which all have the same decor. On highlight is the changing of the place guard ceremony twice a day except Mondays, If you are over 65 take a copy of your passport or other proof of age as its free entry. We also found the last Wednesday of the Month was free. Expect to spend around 1.5 to 2 hours here"
884,5.0,"One of the five palaces in Seoul and is the largest one. Highly recommended: wear a hanbok, korea's traditional costume, while exploring the palace. Highlights: changing of the guards ceremony."
885,5.0,"The palace is nice. There is an entrance fee and they have translators there so you can speak with someone who knows English. But if you rent a hanbok just outside pf the gate there is a shop and they accept credit cards, entrance is free. Rental of hanbok is 7000won for 2 hours."
886,5.0,This is a must in Seoul. Built 25 years before the Forbidden City. It looked to somehow similar in structure. Beautiful buildings. Interesting heating systems in the ancient buildings. They have a change of guards ceremony. Amazing !!! I enjoyed the visit.
887,4.0,"This palace sits conveniently near the center of Seoul and is easily accessible by bus or train. You can easily spend half a day there. There are many Koreans and tourists wearing their hanbok costumes taking pictures everywhere.  The area is huge and you need to buy an entry ticket. Its KRW 3,000 for adults and KRW 1,500 for youngsters. There are 2 guard changing ceremonies(at 10am and 2pm), so time your visit so that you can watch the ceremony. There are also guides with different languages at scheduled timings."
888,4.0,"You can walk around all over the grounds by yourself and read the signs they have. But the your best bet is to take the guided tour in your language. They are offered several times a day. Check their website for the most up to date information. The changing of the guard is also a must see. Lots of people in traditional dress. Cheap to get in. Less than $3 US. Wear your walking shoes. The ground is uneven everywhere, and there are lots of steps, and a few ramps."
889,4.0,"We went on Seollal. It was crowded but because the grounds were huge, we were able to take photos and enjoy the palace grounds without fighting with people. As it was Seollal, entry is free as well! I think that arranging your visit to coincide with the changing of the guards parade will make your visit alot more interesting! Worth a visit!"
890,5.0,Gyeongbokgung station exit 3-1 .. there's alot of Hanbok boutiques for rental n walking distance to Gyeongbokgung very near .
891,3.0,"tried on the hanbok at a nearby rental shop and got complimentary entry passes to the Palace. It was very crowded and people were taking photos everywhere. The facilities were minimum and there seemed to be only one cafe for visitors to have a quite bite or hot drink.  in my opinion, if you are interested to just take photos of yourself in a hanbok this place is an ideal choice. if you are into history and culture, i don't think it would be good ."
892,4.0,... if you're into saegeuk.  Wear a hanbok to get into character Bring a friend who wouldn't mind being your unofficial photographer Walkaround the entire palace ground (huge) Go into the Museum to read more of their History
893,2.0,"We came to Seoul in Feb and were really looking forward to seeing this place. I was very glad that it only cost around 3000W/person otherwise I would just ask for my money back. Everything is fake. The different areas are rebuilt and are just new and reconstruction. You cant really get to the chambers. You will get more history and artifacts if you go to the Palace museum to the right of the main entrance and its FREE! The guard change is just laughable - the fakeness of it! The fake beards, the fake weapons... I guess it goes with the whole place."
894,5.0,It's one of the most beautiful places in the Kyubgbokgung Palace. Used to be the place for receiving foreign guest and have banquet here.
895,5.0,"I was told to choose this palace if I could make just one. I am glad I followed the advise. Very easy to get there, and the experience was more than expected. I got lucky and saw the change of guards, and saw a lot (hundreds) of local people in local customs taking pictures of themselves and visiting the palace. I asked them why they were dressed like that and the answer was a tradition- loved it."
896,5.0,"I have visited Gyeongbukgung twice, once in the summer and once in the winter time. I personally hate cold weather, but, Gyeongbukgung is so much better in the winter time. With less tourist and less heat, you can wear the Korean traditional clothes comfortably during the winter time."
897,4.0,"Definitely worth a visit if you are in Seoul. If you want a full experience, I would go rent a hanbok (the traditional Korean dress) at a nearby store before going into the palace. If you do rent a hanbok then admission is free! They have bag storage at the rental places so your outfit won't be ruined by a backpack or something. If you go during the winter, use base layers to keep warm."
898,4.0,"If you had enough time to visit just one palace in Seoul, this would be the one. Gyeongbokgung is the main royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. Most of the visit focuses on building exteriors, grounds and courtyard though there are some buildings where you can look in through the door and snap a few photos.  Do consider the free guided tour that occurs throughout the day (1-1.5 hours) as well as the Changing of the Palace Guard Ceremony at 10:00 and 14:00. There is also a Gate Guard Duty performance at 11:00 and 13:00. And of course, you can always rent the popular hanbok attire for photo ops at nearby shops."
899,5.0,This place needs no review as it is a must see place while visiting Seoul. It is stunning and surreal. The changing of the guard happens at 10 am everyday and if you can be there at 9:45 you will be glad you did.
900,4.0,"I visited on a public holiday so there were many visitors at the time. Lots of space, artefacts, old court documents, costumes."
901,4.0,"This is my second visit. Once in summer (no shade and very hot so I didn’t walk around much). This time in winter, I was able to walk around more. The changing of the guards is every hour, on the hour and is worth seeing. It’s free. The costumes are colourful and the drums are cool. The palace entrance is 3000 won. The grounds are expansive and besides the pavilions and buildings, it’s pretty sparse. There were plenty of people in traditional costumes taking photos. There is a folk museum too but I didn’t go in."
902,5.0,"This one is definitely one of my favorite place during my 5 year living in Seoul. The place can be crowded sometimes but if you choose the right time to visit, this place offers a lot. They have a lot of spot where you can take beautiful pictures, and they offer a different vibes every different season. And there's also this museum inside the palace where you can learn about Korea's past time. So yeah, it's good. =D  Oh~! and one more thing, if you come here wearing a Hanbok (Korean traditional costume) then you can get inside here for free."
903,4.0,"It was a cold day and the trees were all bare (as expected in winter) but the grandeur of the palace and the grounds around it was still impressive. Even better was the changing of the guards. If you’re going to the palace, make sure you get to see this."
904,4.0,"Despite not being as big as the palaces in China, I still think Gyeongbok Palace is one place not too be missed when you visit Korea.  We were there for only one hour as we arrived late in the day. So please check the hours of operation. They really chased you out when it was time to close."
905,5.0,"My wife and I love attending palaces, museums etc in the countries we visit. We attended the palace and partook in the free tour. It was extremely informative and we really enjoyed it. Further more there was no request for tips or any form of payment. As the tour ended our guide thanked us for our time, wished us all the best on our holiday and then walked off. She was extremely polite and informative the entire tour and I actually felt like I wanted to tip her given how brilliant she was.  I would highly recommend taking the free tour as you get so much more out of it that just walking around yourself"
906,3.0,"The palace and the palace ground were impressive, just as we see them on TV. Well preserved, clean and well loved."
907,5.0,"This was a great place to visit. At $3 for entrance fee with a free (and excellent) English tour, this is a must for all visitors to Seoul. Do take note of closing days (I think Tuesday). You can also combine the entrance fee to the other palaces for a bargain but I felt that I didn’t need to see the others after this one."
908,4.0,"We took the metro and went to Gyeongbokgung Palace. Unfortunately, I didn’t rent Hanbok because it was really cold that time. It was -16 degrees Celcius when we toured the grounds of the palace. There were student volunteers who would tour you around the Palace explaining the history and the areas in detail. They are English-speaking tour guides and it’s for free. The students are training to be a teacher in the future that’s why they volunteer to tourists who wants to know the Palace’s history. The whole ground will take you more than an hour to cover. The grounds were huge and if you watch Korean historical dramas, most of the scenes were shot here (I particularly like Hwarang and Love in the Moonlight).  Gyeongbokgung Palace Gyeongbokgung Station (Seoul Subway Line 3) and Exit 5. SUBWAY: 14mis: Euljiro 1 - - Euljiro 3 - - - - Gyeongbokgung"
909,4.0,"Definitely worth while to visit, staff very friendly to answer any question. Unfortunately lot of the pavilions are closed, so not much tonsee, other palace is better for this, bit nice grounds to walk around. Changing of the guards is not authentic and very touristic unfortunately."
910,4.0,A Majestic Palace!! A must place to visit!!! You will be amazed of what rich history it must had held by just looking at the place and the intricate design on the ceilings and in the walls.
911,5.0,I had a great time here it was informative and easy to get around even on a Sunday when many people visit. Be aware that the museum on the left as you enter is free (and also worth it) but there is one further in that has a cost of I believe 3000 won.  If you can go in the winter you may even be able to see the frozen lake which is a great photo opportunity!
912,3.0,We spent 2hrs there in the morning.the palace is very nice to take photos.you can get a free english speaking guide.which you have to to understand about everything.at 11am you can watch changing of the guards at the main gate except on tuesdays.it is not suitable for wheelchairs as there are many steps.
913,5.0,"Simply, you are not visiting Seoul if you do not visit Gyeongbukgung Palace together with Gwanghwamun Gate. This palace carries so much history that it is a must for all visitors to visit. Make sure you catch the guard changing ceremony."
914,4.0,"A must visit place if one really want to look and feel the true korean culture and heritage. All the buildings are well preserved. To get the best experience, try to go during the changing of royal guard ceremony (everyday, except on Tuesday, at 10 am and 2 pm), it really worth watching."
915,4.0,What a cool place to visit. There is a lot of history here to see. There is a museum next door too that is connected and I believe part of the exhibit that has history displays. There was a changing of the guard at the front entrance of the Palace that was cool too.
916,4.0,This is an amazing palace complex well worth a visit and try and include the changing of the guard. It’s large so lots of walking but flat terrain so comfortable and then a short walk to the presidential blue house.
917,5.0,"Seriously one of the most beautiful palaces i've ever been to. It's a MUST! And do not go if you are on a rush, you will need time."
918,5.0,"This is the most well-known palace in Korea. Representing Joseon Dynasty, visitors who are interested in Korean history and culture would have fun here.  - Visitors in Hanbok are free to enter.  - There are special programs like evening performances or entrance to Gyeonghoeru Pavilion. So, check them out on the website. You'll have more fun to join them.  - There are ceremonies at Gwanghwamun Gate(광화문). 10:00/11:00/13:00/14:00  - Hyangwonjeong Pavilion(향원정) is so amazing with lotus pond. It's still under repair unfortunately. Only watching through small windows is allowed.  - Gyeonghoeru(경회루) is a large pavilion with nice pond around. The access is only available during special period.  - National Palace Museum(국립고궁박물관) and National Folk Museum(국립민속박물관) locate inside Gyeongbokgung. They are also good to visit."
919,3.0,"Nothing much except that’s it’s really big. Went during winter, lots of space to walk around but nothing really fascinating"
920,4.0,Enjoyed our visit to the palace an was lovely to walk around (also close to other attractions such as Bukchon Hanock Village and Jogyesa temple. Admission cost was 3000 won.
921,4.0,We managed to walk to this location as our hotel is located within walking distances. We had wanted to watch the change of guard but unfortunately it was snowing and the change of guards procession had to be postponed. But we do welcome the snow as it turned the whole palace compound white and it lift the moods of tourists who visited it !  We took some spectacular photos at this location .  Highly recommended to visit !
922,4.0,We arrived Gyeongbokgung Palace around 11am and the ticket can be purchased easily when arrived. The ticket queue seems much longer in the afternoon when we're about to leave so start early if you can. Most of the visitors were dressed up in Hanbok costume (traditional Korean dress) where you can rent it. Do note that the guard changing ceremony is at 10am and 2pm. There's a free English Guided tour at 11am but I believe there're other timings in the afternoon as well.
923,5.0,As part of the tour of the Palace grounds you will encounter this austere yet beautiful building. The setting is perfect for group pictures and a quiet moment.
924,4.0,I love watching korean drama joseon era... do i love it. Its simple .... nothing special if u don't appreciate history. My friend and i rend an hanbok from the near rental shop which cost us 15000 won per person and we enjoyed taking nice pic with it.
925,5.0,We were there for just an hour. But our eyes drank in the beautiful view. The place has a rich history. Most ideal time to visit the place is autumn.
926,4.0,"Be there by 10.00 am to watch the changing of the royal guard ceremony; then take a leisurely stroll around the palace grounds and visit the various pavillions and palace buildings. You can cover the palace in about 2.5 hours. Entrance fee is KRW3,000."
927,5.0,"I would not miss this palace whenever I came to Seoul. It was just magnificent. Crowded most of the time especially on weekends. If you are lucky, you may be able to visit at night. This year, it closed on Nov. 3. New comers are usually fascinated by the imperial guard ceremonies in the front courtyard. Since I have visited the place many times previously, I rather look for interesting people and things around, for photography."
928,4.0,The palace ground is so big that 2 hours tour is not enough. The palace are well maintained. Free entrance if your wearing hanbok outfit. Palace guard perform traditional drum parade.
929,5.0,Rent the Hanbok and walk around the palace like royalty.  Be sure to time your visit for the changing of the guard.
930,4.0,"if you not a history or archi buff, all korean palaces look almost the same to the untrained eye. This is no different. But the changing of the guard ceremony at 10am or 2pm is worth catching. The ceremony is free but hte palace entry is payable.."
931,5.0,"If it’s your first time in Seoul, this is a must see. The palace is huge, you will need to allot 1 to 2 hours or more if you fancy taking pictures while wearing hanbok. The place can get very crowded. Check the schedule of changing of guards and be there to watch it."
932,5.0,"This palace is beautiful! You get a view of the mountains right behind the palace too. We came in hanboks so we didn't need to pay for entrance. It would have cost us 3000won (18 below is 1500won). You can find their national palace and folk museums inside. They also have a nice cafe where you can find good souvenirs. Lots of places to take photos at. It started drizzling and it added to the drama. They have a changing of the guard ceremony but we didn't get to see that. It happens evert 11am and 3pm. There are English, Japanese, and Chinese guides but you'd need to inquire in advance. Definitely a must go to place!"
933,5.0,We arrived in time for the changing of guards ceremony. After watching the ceremony and taking photos we proceeded to rent some Hanbok to wear. We easily found one near the gate. Rent the hanbok for 4 hours so we have an ample time to explore. The place is big enough that you have enough private space even though there were a lot of people during our visit. Lots of areas for photo ops with all the traditional Korean architecture all around. We came during autumn so the colors of the leaves enhances more the beauty of the palace. There were also lots of tourist that came in hanbok. Definitely had a great time with this experience.
934,5.0,"I went to Gyeongbokgung Palace last year with my friends. The transportation to get there is not complicated. I took the subway( Line 3 orange one) and got off at Gyeongbokgung Palace station. I was really excited to try Hanbok on which is Korean traditional clothes.  There are many shops where visitors can lend Hanbok. My friends and I also wore Hanbok. We walked around inside of Gyeongbokgung Palace, and the time was really good because it was super peaceful.  If you like peaceful place, I recommend you enjoy Gyeongbokgung Palace with Hanbok."
935,4.0,Do yourself and other tourists a favor and rent a hanbok from one of the nearby rental places across the road before going in. You save the price of admission (which admittedly isn't high) and have a whole lot more fun.
936,4.0,"I would suggest to go early. So that you can get your insta-worthy shots without too much background distractions. We reached the palace around 10am-11am and it is already packed. It might be due to that I visited the palace on Sunday. Such a shame that I didn't get to watch the guard changing ceremony. Good thing that our tour guide is well versed with the history of the palace, so we don't have to use the tour provided by the palace."
937,5.0,"other reviews have summarized the palace nicely so i'll just add a few extra points:  - changing of the guard happens twice daily. i saw the morning change and the route goes from the side door by the ticket booth to the front main entrance at gwanghwamun gate, with most of the action taking place in the middle aisle approaching the gate. situate yourself accordingly.  - attempted to use the discover seoul pass for palace entry and we were denied by two different ticketing agents. it's only 3000 krw though so paying the entrance fee wasn't an issue. just a heads up for others using the pass!  - didn't join a tour group because of time constraints but if you have the time to wander the grounds slowly, i'd suggest joining a free tour group! you'll get even more insight than just from the pamphlets.  - while there are some ramps available, the grounds as a whole aren't very wheelchair friendly. i saw a few elderly tour groups struggling to push people in wheelchairs over the stone pathways. i can see the terrain and general layout of many thresholds and stairs as being a hazard for people using canes, walkers, and other mobility aids."
938,4.0,nice and scenic. good for pictures taking. must rent the costume from the east side of the palace. free entrance if you are in costume. otherwise need to purchase ticket.
939,3.0,"Cheap enough to enter and as others have said, once you've seen one you've kinda seen them all. Would recommend."
940,5.0,No comment. This the best Palace in Seoul compare to other palace. The view is prefect even without autumn leave. Must visit.
941,3.0,This palace is definitely worth visiting. Be prepared to walk as it is big. Changing ceremony is good but do note that it is supremely busy so try and find a quiet time or go early.
942,5.0,"As an avid fan of main attractions when travelling, I find Gyeongbokgung a great experience because it is value for money and it is immersive. You get to walk around the palace almost unrestricted and the place is well maintained. Great for photos and a half day session. Be sure to catch the changing of guard ceremony that happens at midday.  Check out one of the traditional costume rentals around the vicinity of the palace and rent them around 15000-20000 won for two hours.It's great because you don't have to pay for palace entry when you're in costume!"
943,3.0,"Make sure you catch the English(or your language) free tour they offer twice a day. Without that and coming from more grandiose places( in India), this might not look like a big deal unless you learn the history."
944,4.0,"We enjoyed visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace very much. We were, unfortunately, there during a rainy patch. It would have been a lot more fun on a sunny day. Many visitors show up in traditional Korean dress and take photographs, which adds to the ambiance."
945,5.0,We spent a few hours living/wandering through the Josein Dynasty as we explored this palace. Easy access to the area by bus or Subway. We arrived in time to watch the guard change at the front gate and then wandered inside. Loved especially watching the gals in their period dresses taking each other’s pictures. It was a great day.
946,5.0,"After a nice lunch at nearby famous eatery, we walk to Gyeongbokgung, the weather is cool but the sun is torching above us. The surrounding atmospehere is great because you can see a huge percentage of people wearing hanbok, Korean traditional costume and alot of people are shooting photo like pro inside the place.  And so coincidence the day we visited is the beginning of chuseok, where the entrance is free to every one, the palace it self is quite a huge area, the setup and building is heavily Chinese influence.  My kids are having lot of fun inside, because they can run around the palace spacey area, they have a small cafeteria inside where you can have sip of coffee and some light korean delights. In it there is a small section of souvenir corner too where you can get some Gyeongbokgung Palace related items"
947,5.0,Korea has preserved this place of over 600+ years and it still looks spot on. The place is scenic and incredible. It is very rich in history and there's a free English tour.
948,5.0,This is a hitoric and intesting 600 year old palace. Great view of the old and new parts of Sepul from the terrace. The Banquet hall is elegant and peaceful. Free admission.
949,4.0,"The location of the palace is accessible by subway and there are lots of helpful signage to reach the area. Take note that the palace is HUGE - so pls wear proper walking shoes and be prepared for some exercise! If you rented a hanbok (traditional Korean clothing) then you would be waived for the entrance fee, but for those who wear the usual clothes, you need to join a long line to queue for entrance fee of KW6000.  We arrived just in time for the activity for training palace soldiers on attack and defense, it was quite a show by the soldiers complete with drumbeats and war-cries. After that was the activity for changing of the palace guards, which had a marching band and another set of cultural steps to show the audience. The costumes were lovely and really brought us back to feeling the age of that era!  The buildings are really something to admire the intricacy of designs and the entire palace grounds layout is amazing. The flooring is mostly made from uneven stones, so pls ensure you have proper shoes to walk steadily. It makes me wonder how do people from those days run on such ground!"
950,5.0,"At first I thought this would only take a half hour to get the gist of, but we ended up watching the changing of the guard, strolling around the pond, and also seeing the throne room, which was all nice. Then we moved through the historic village on the premises and really liked that. We didn’t go inside the cultural center or the gallery on the grounds. We ended up spending two hours, and could have stayed longer. Well worth the entry fee of around $3."
951,3.0,"We took the train and came out on the opposite end and hence we didnt know there was another exit where you will see rows of rentals of hanbok. We went into the palace expecting to rent hanbok for the children and realized they were outside (we saw many of them when we left). Would be nice if there is a notice board or something where they can inform us where to go for the rental. If you are coming out of the palace, turn to your left towards the station. when you hit the first traffic light, you will see lots of rental shops opposite. That's the place to rent your hanbok for photo taking. The palace itself was nice but probably I was expecting more. The palaces look pretty much alike and nothing much to see for us. Probably they do not have a richer and older history as China. We practically walk everywhere in the compound and our last stop was the library where you will have to take your shoes off and be real quiet! I don't think I enjoyed unless there was an event there. If not, I think its worth to skip it unless you really want to dress in your hanbok and walk under the hot sun (yes we went in June)!"
952,4.0,"this place was quiet comfy for me but it made me sleepy being here for 1 hours. i like the environment, very clean and nice."
953,5.0,"We loved this place. It is very big, its not only one palace but a series of royal palaces and gardens as well. You should allow about two hours at least to see it all. and it was so great that when we arrived we found out there was a free English tour every hour o half hour, which takes over one hour. The guide was a really nice Korean girl and she took us to the most important parts of the palace and gave us very very interesting explanations about the life there, the architecture, etc. After the tour is done she recommends you to go to the rest of the places in the palace complex - its huge, but we already learned some background about it. There are two museums very close to the palace, so it may take even half a day to see it all. Definetely worth visiting."
954,4.0,"Love it love it love it ... picture perfect, truely enjoyed. Its like going back in time, visiting the golden era."
955,4.0,"If you are in Seoul, this is a must-go place. Beautiful, beautiful palace. Big compound. Join the guided tour to understand its history better. You can easily spend 3 hours here."
956,3.0,You need to come here if you’re planning to visit Seoul  Just a ‘must visit’ area. Not more than that i think
957,4.0,"What we can admire currently is the result of the modern day government's great effort of rebuild / restoration because like too many other historical sites in Korea it was unfortunately heavily destroyed by Japan in various invasions throughout the centuries.  This main palace is quite large and nice, many interesting things to see - except the changing guards performance which we found ordinary and boring. Skip it during the performance times than you will have the palace to yourself quietly : )"
958,5.0,It is definitely worth stopping by and do try to see the changing of the guards around 10am any day other than Tuesday.
959,5.0,A must see when in South korea.  They have the exchange in guards ceremony that is entertaining. Great tour if you are into palaces.
960,5.0,"We visited on a Wednesday and the palace was quite busy. It is a very good experience to see this palace. There are many people dressed in the traditional Korean attire which is lovely to look at and get some photos of. The queue for the tickets wasn’t bad at all, only 5 minutes long. Tickets very reasonably priced! Equivalent of 5 Euro for a ticket. There are many areas to walk around and explore within the palace boundaries. All buildings have explanations in English and Korean which was nice to be able to understand. The changing of the guard happens at 2pm and is a must see! It is directly inside the gates and does get very busy for this so be sure to be there 10 minutes before to get the best view. A lovely day exploring traditional ancient Korea."
961,5.0,In my opinion this is the most remarkable place on your trip to Seoul. You get a feel for how korea used to be in past and it's very easy to get here using the subway. Check the closing times though as i believe it closes around 5pm most the time .
962,4.0,"I will wrote down my bad experience here, we went here without expecting the place would be that huge, we wore hanbok ( since you'll get free admission) and took pictures inside the area , half an hour later we left, we didn't explore the whole area ) and I just realized that I lost my phone, I ran back to find it but it's gone, I asked the securities and almost no one speaks english ! I found it's very irritating becuase it's one of the first tourist destination and nobody speaks english! the lady in the security guard told me to go back to the first gate which I already went to and they couldn't help me, and they didn't do anything to check if someone found my phone, at the end somebody told me that her nephew found my phone and HAND IT TO THE LOST AND FOUND COUNTER! it irritated me most because that means they didn't even checked the lost and found counter ( that is hiding behind the dessert counter ) . The attarction itself is nice, spare your time becuase it's huge, if you rent hanbok make it at least 2,5 hours so you can wear them around the cultural village as well. But if you need help , embrace yourself since nobody speaks english to help you."
963,4.0,"Very well-maintained palace.  This is one of the 5 major palaces available for tourists in South Korea and I think the one that’s most accessible.  There are 2 main entrances to this palace, we went through the entrance outside of the National Folk Museum of Korea, which was free, so you can also visit that place before going to the palace itself."
964,5.0,"The changing of the guard at Gyeonngbokgung palace is a lot of fun. It's easy to get a good viewing spot and take photos. The ceremony itself is colorful and lively. The best part is when it's over, you're allowed to take photos with the participants."
965,4.0,"be sure to visit this palace - the first and main of all palaces own by the chosen dynasty. lots of people walking in traditional Korean clothe, the place is really big and interesting to see some Asian traditions."
966,5.0,"One of the larger palaces to see. Lovely grounds, with ponds and greenery to stroll through. The changing of the guards is especially interesting. 2 Korean Museums are on the same grounds and we enjoyed them also."
967,4.0,"First some top tips  Closed on Tuesdays ( well it was when we went) We wanted to see the changing of the gaurd at 10.00 hrs - it starts very promptly. Stand on the right hand side to watch, as you are near the drum and effectively everything marches by twice as they leave the parade square. Best tip, last Wednesday of every month is Korean culture day..........its free!!!!!!!!!  Geat place with good history, we took a free English speaking tour. This met at 11.00 hrs inside the second gate on the right. There is a meeting post you can see as you go in. This was very beneficial.  Gaurds I am told are actors rather than military. Beards all look great........from a distance.  Nice clean toilets in the museum , housed in a modern building on the far left of the first main square where the changing of the gaurd takes place."
968,5.0,Please come here and you can pose around the palace. Just take note that they have few gates. If you're not coming from the front gate make sure to ask the guard how you can go to the front gate. I was quite lost at that time 🤣 don't forget to rent your hanbok!
969,5.0,"One of the great things about Seoul is that the old and new are within reach in the capital. You will pay a small fee to get into the palace but it is worth doing. Due to proximity, consider doing Changdeokgung Palace and Bukchon village at the same time."
970,4.0,The palace is pretty though a bit bare compared to Indian and European palaces. The walk around the gardens was a delight.
971,5.0,"I was visiting Gyeongbokgung to make the K-Drama scene I watch every single week comes true. The palace is so traditional and ethnical, and we could take pictures with traditional Hanbok (but remember that the Hanbok should be rented outside Gyeongbokgung Palace area)."
972,5.0,"Amazing great experience - you should see the changing of the guard. Bring an umbrell , fan and or hat as this is a sun soaked experience. I must have lost 2 lbs of water weight seeing this great ceremony. We were on a tour for this which is good as they could explain all the nuances of the site"
973,5.0,It’s mandotary to see. A ceremony is done in the enterance at 10:00. It’s a pleasure to watch. You have to spend at least two hours to visit.
974,4.0,Nice place to walk around and visit the different chambers... It is nice to have a guide to explain the history...
975,5.0,"If you like history you should visit gyeongbokgung palace, you can see royal guard performances and learn about korean history. You should allocate sufficient time to enjoy the palace."
976,5.0,"Should be on your bucket list when in Seoul, large premise so do allocate sufficient time to slowly enjoy what the place have to offer. Tend to get crowded during public holidays"
977,5.0,Great value of Korean Culture and Tradition dates back to thousand years.History lovers will definitely enjoy this gigantic palace with great views and excellent architecture
978,4.0,"This was actually the first major attraction I visited upon moving to Korea almost five years ago. I have been several times since; most recently in the spring of 2018. It is of great historical significance and also never seems to end. However, it is also overrun with tourists. Especially on weekends."
979,4.0,"Those who are exploring SEOUL this palace is a wonderful option, Half Day Trip will educate you about the history of Korea."
980,5.0,If you are in Korea you must visit Gyeongbokgung Palace for sure. The guard change attraction is very amusing as well as Korean girls wearing hanbok. You will get the feel of Joseon era in every corner of the Palace
981,5.0,I like the place because it is historic and well designed and have beautiful buildings and landscape
982,5.0,Great history here. If you get a chance take a tour and you will learn stuff that you would not know by just walking around.
983,5.0,"I've visited this before and went again with a friend. While it was hot when we went (mid-July) it was a nice trip. Various areas were being renovated while we were there. There are signs in several languages (to include English) which explain what each building or object is. There is a museum attached to the grounds which is nice to visit. If you go in the summer, bring a hat and water. There is underground parking but is limited in the number of spots. The cost to enter is reasonable but you will need Korean Won."
984,5.0,"Definitely worth visiting, very beautiful palace. Entrance is cheap, free if dressed in Hanbok. free English tour was great too. Informative but not too long."
985,5.0,"it's already my second time visiting, but still amazed by its design and construction. Strongly recommended to spend at least a couple of hours inside and around that neighborhood. Worthy of checking in."
986,5.0,Big Palace and Amazing Palace. And if we came at 10.00 or 14.00 we can looking change guardian. Near from Subway Station. If we came with hanbok they will give us free entry.
987,5.0,It's a must visit if you're new to Seoul. This amazing palace (the main palace in the latter part of the Choseon Dynasty) becomes even more beautiful in the clear blue sky days. Indeed a green haven in the heart of the city.
988,4.0,"This palace has a very large area which is divided into several parts. The front of the palace as in the palace there are generally guard guards where tourists can take photos and if we are lucky we can witness the procession of replacing the palace guards. The middle part is the king's palace which is not too big but magnificent. Then on the side of the palace there is a very large garden, very beautiful and very suitable for relaxation. Tourists can relax in this area. In general this palace has a high historical value for the population of South Korea. and as information if the diatric straight line, this palace has a straight line with Seoul Tower or Namshan Tower"
989,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung is a must-see for anyone who is traveling to Korea for its history and traditional culture. The palace grounds are wide and you can see various traditional buildings with traditional art that are perfect for artists and architect enthusiasts. Surrounding the palace are hanbok rental stores where you can rent beautiful hanboks for about 2 hours for about 10,000 won. Considering that a basic hanbok is a few hundred thousand won, it's a great deal for those who just want to wear it for a day. It also gets you free entry into the palace (normal admission is 3,000 won for adults)."
990,5.0,"Even in hot summer, there was lots people here. Some wore Korean traditional costume and took photos, with many of them were non-Korean. There is a subway station that can reach to it directly. There is a museum next to it and free of charges. A good place to hide from the strong sunshine for a while. With many big palace houses, a must go venue for costume photo taking. Better go earlier to avoid the crowds. But if you the guided tour in several languages, you need to go after lunch."
991,5.0,"This place is like Verseille in Paris, Schönbrunn in Vienna or the Empire State Building in NYC a must-see in Seoul. If you have time go inside and take a tour, it is a nice impression about the Korean culture."
992,5.0,Loved the palace! It played a fundamental part in the history of Seoul and South Korea. Beautiful place with over 7000 rooms. The place is extremely walking friendly and traditional with such neat architecture
993,5.0,One of several nice palaces in the north of Seoul. Close to Insadong but peaceful (apart from the occassional giant tour group)
994,5.0,"This is a huge castle that is situated next to the Folk museum and other museums and it takes a lot of time to see it, especially if you like sitting around gazing at the constructions. Obviously there is an evening ticket, that is possibility to visit it at night, around 7 pm. This information is not available on the webpage. I found it out by coincidence. Very easy to reach. Bus 272 stops at it as well as the subway - line 3. Not far away from Insadong."
995,4.0,"Visited on a really hot day in summer. Be aware that there is little shade on the paths and none at the Changing of the Guard so bring sunscreen and an umbrella or cover up. We used the audio tour which was 5,000kw (you need to leave a form of ID as collateral). It was a good one because it paused until you indicated you were in the right area rather than it continue and you're struggling to get to the next spot. I think I would have preferred a tour with a guide though. I didn't feel like I got enough of the history from the audio tour. Keep walking right to the back of the Palace gardens to get a view of the Blue House (Korea's version of the White House). The highlight was the re-enactment of the Changing of the Guard so be sure to look up when that's on. I wish I had dressed up in the Hanbok (I had even found one that catered for bigger western sizes) but it was just too hot. I already suffered in the sun. Try the teas at the kiosk!! Yum but very sweet. It was very easy to get to the Palace on the Subway, a side pathway takes you straight there."
996,5.0,Second time going here; this time with family. It's always a great place to go to appreciate the history of South Korea. Our family was lucky to enter without a fee when we went.
997,4.0,We enjoyed visiting the palace....honestly the place was out of this world....very quiet...green scenery a real flash from the past kind of an architectural building strongly recommend everyone to visit.
998,4.0,"Whether you are sensitive to history or not, this palace will please you. The guides are very attentive and will give you great anecdotes about the life of the royal Koreans at the height of this building. A must see!"
999,5.0,I went here due to the free transit tour during my long layover in Korea. The palace itself is amazing and good thing that this iconic place is maintained very well. The place is huge hence maps or probably signages will be helpful for foreign people like me.
1000,5.0,We spent a few hours walking around the palace grounds. It was much bigger than we expected but the architecture was beautiful and well kept. We had a 3 year old with us and he loved exploring the countless pathways until he got tired and opted to ride in the stroller. They had many ramps around the palace so the stroller was not a problem. Overall a very worthwhile place to tour in Seoul for a step back in to history.
1001,4.0,I really like the style and decoration of Korean palaces so enjoyed this highest one despite the heat of the day - - the complex of buildings covers many acres and there are huge courtyards open to the blazing sum in between buildings so may be best to avoid in the heat of the day. I visited on Sunday so as many as half of the visitors were wearing national dress adding to the experience. I understand that anyone can rent these as costumes at nearby shops for ~$20 and then receive free admission to the palace and plenty of photo ops. While I was there a quintet dressed in traditional clothes playing traditional music entertained for a while under a little grove of trees near the garden. Very nice!
1002,3.0,"Compared to most our palace visit, this was uninspiring. I thought it would be much bigger, but the King's palace is very small. I don't get the barrier around the pond with windows to peek through to see the Pagoda, looks abandon.  Aside from the entrance guards, there are nothing to interact with after the guards, just a few old buildings, you can walk through this in about an hour, will be bored after the palace.  The most interesting thing was seeing all the Chinese tourists dressed in traditional attire walking around, we took pictures with a few.  Need signage to describe what we are looking at, I rented the audio guide, without that, one would be clueless on what they are looking at."
1003,5.0,"Like other people have stated, the entrance is free if you're wearing a hanbok and it was definitely worth it in my opinion. Me and my boyfriend both rented them (rent for one was 20000w for 4 hours in our case) and they were so beautiful. A lot of people are wearing them also so you don't have to be shy.  The changing of the guard ceremony was imteresting to see. It was also explained in English, I am not sure if that's every time or if we were just lucky to be there at the right time though.  The palace itself is very beautiful and the palace grounds is a very large area that you can easily spend a lot of time exploring. It is also cool when you look to the city and see the modern cityline outside of the historical palace wall. A mix of old and new.  We also visited a traditional tea house inside the palace grounds and while it probably was more expensive than the tea places outside the grounds it was very nice. Their fruit tea was honestly one of the best I have ever tried."
1004,4.0,Watched the changing of the guards in the morning and then spent 90 minutes exploring the palace. It’s a must visit. Check the times for the changing of the guard.
1005,5.0,We attended a guided tour in English. The guide made the tour extra interesting and funny. One of our top excursions on our Seoul journey.
1006,5.0,"The Royal palace in Seoul is a great attraction to visit, much has been written about the palace on TA. This is a huge complex of buildings and outdoor areas to explore, that is why I highly recommend taking one of the free guided tours which are offered daily in four languages, English, Korean, Japanese and Chinese, then after the tour wander around on your own. The tour lasts between 1-1.5 hours depending on the size of the group and the guide. Our guide was most informative as she lead our group of about twenty five around the complex. We were told many interesting stories and facts about the life in the Royal Palace, about family members, details of the architecture and general life in the palace. The Palace is inexpensive to visit, 3000 won/adult, but I believe if you come dressed in traditional Korean costume you can get in for free."
1007,4.0,Like the palace from the outside...it is a pity visitors are not allowed to look inside rooms inside the palace. But in July the weather is really hot even for us from tropical country ! It is definitely better to visit in spring or autumn season. We look around the palace just after a quick tour inside the museum.
1008,5.0,The changing of the guard should not be missed. It was definitely a high light of our vacation. It was beautiful to see. The Palace was impressive and out tour guide was very informative in explaining the history and culture. So go with a guided tour!!!
1009,4.0,"Many of the historical sites in S. Korea are rebuilt or refurbished, but they are beautiful all the same. They have a strong cultural tradition, much like their food traditions -- that are interesting and rich."
1010,4.0,We went at night. The place was amazing I could spend lots of time just looking at the detail. This is a very easy walk.
1011,5.0,Beautiful and grand palace. Make sure you catch the Changing of the Guards ceremony and take lots of photos! Its culturally rich and very colourful ceremony.
1012,4.0,"At 13h there is a free English guided tour which passes by the main buildings of the palace. Make sure to take the tour, because otherwise it is just a collection of old buildings and you have no clue where to look for or what their purpose was."
1013,5.0,"The history and culture is rich! I highly recommend a visit here, pack a lunch and make it a picnic! This is a place to enjoy, and take in! I couldn’t spend enough time here if I tried! Also take advantage of the free speaking tours!"
1014,5.0,I’ve loved the experience of wearing a traditional Korean cloth (Hanbok) and walking in the palace. The admission to Gyeongbokgung Palace was free since we were wearing Hanbok. I do encourage people who wants to experience Korean culture to visit the palace. The rental shops are near by the Palace where they offer for men’s and Women’s Korean clothes. There are few coffee shops and gift shops inside. Beside you will be able to see presidential blue palace.
1015,5.0,"You are not ""visiting"" korea if haven't visit this palace! very unique and beautiful buildings! You even can rent hanbok, a korean traditional cloths and going around this huge palaces!"
1016,5.0,"We learned a lot of the history of Korea when we visited the palace. Despite the place being packed and the rain, we had a great time. This is definitely one of the must see places in Seoul."
1017,5.0,It's a nice place for a historic site visit. I was with my friends and they gave me a real good and well rounded tour along with a nice dinner place recommendation right next to the palace.
1018,3.0,Cater 4 hours for a stroll through the palace. I strongly suggest to engage a local guide to inform your group. There are local guides who volunteer without charge. The stories could have come from a K drama.
1019,5.0,"Most the group tour this is number one attraction to visit, we came on hop-on hop-off Seoul city tour bus A is Downtown and Palace course, we got on at Myeongdong, it took about 35 minutes to get here, along the way, we pass many attractions which we already visited, still fun the see all part of the city, this is a very big Palace with many buildings, many tourist young and old dress in the traditional costume, taking pictures with their cell phone, good memory photos to bring home to show friends, it's a huge area, easily take couple hour or more, you can see the change of guard on schedule 10 am and 2 pm."
1020,5.0,"This place is huge and a lot of walking. There was a ceremony for about 10 mins and it was nice. I don’t know how much would it cost for the entrance, since our tour guide got it for us. A lot of people, but since the place so big that people were at diff places. Overall, great place to visit if you’re in Seoul."
1021,5.0,"Lots of great photo ops, but lots of people even though we were there on a weekday. You should note that you can get in for free if you wear a traditional hanbok, which is very fun to do.  I believe that there is supposed to be a free English language tour, but we didn't find it. It might have been more interesting if we did"
1022,5.0,Well worth a visit. Think of the Forbidden City in Beijing. The Palace is just as amazing to see. It’s a large place with lovely grounds to walk and enjoy and impressive buildings.
1023,4.0,This palace is on a large piece of property with lovely old architecture and statues with the mountains behind on one side and the city on the other. Try to go at 10am or 2pm when they do the changing of the guard at the entry gates.
1024,5.0,"I loved this Palace. I enjoyed it a lot even tho it was raining hard when I went to visit in May.  Some of the pictures have some sun light and many have rain drops.  I’m a single 25 world traveler  The admission for the palace was very affordable 300 Won about 2.70 USD.  I went by myself and I enjoyed walking around and seeing history and Korean style of Agriculture.  I travel a lot and I enjoy seeing history and different styles.  I roamed around the palace for hours and hours lots to see and capture. I sometimes imagine myself in the times when the palace was created and how great there building methods were to be able to still be shown today.  If you are by yourself like me or in a huge group it will be perfect for EVERYONE  I also enjoyed visiting the store in the Gyeongbokgung Palace.  I love buying homemade Souvenirs, prices were reasonable.  If you want to get the beautiful jewelry or crafted big items they are expensive.  Make sure to ask for Tax Free if you are American or a Foreigner.  Hope you enjoyed my pictures and a MUST see if you are in Seoul, South Korea 🇰🇷"
1025,5.0,"When enter the palace you must buy a ticket except you wear a hanbok. There're single ticket ( ₩3000) or combination ticket for 4 palaces and Jongmyo Shrine (₩10.000). If you aren't sure, buy a single ticket. Gyeongbokgung itself very beautiful. Very clean."
1026,4.0,"Great place to know the history of Korea in a day !.  Took a metro train to Gyeongbokgung Station exit 5. After a short stroll, we were lucky to bump into a group of teenagers wearing the same orange coloured T shirts, apparently attached to certain organisation, lined up to be noticed and approached. We were asked whether of foreigners and one 14 yo girl, Veronica offered a guided tour for FREE. Yes, for free. Sure, we took it up right away.  We were recommended to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace for various reasons. She took us to every corner of the palace that lasted 2 hours with detailed Korean history in fluent English.  Inside you can attend and learn Korean palace tea technique and ceremony. Not far from tea site, a restaurant serving ancient palace meal as well.  At 3:30 pm, we were lucky to enjoy Korean classical music with fantastic backdrop as shown in pic.  Unfortunately we missed to rent/wear the Korean ancient costumes (only around the palace). Do remember the renting place is right inside the main gate. First come first serve basis.  Apart from the palace , there are a few great museums within a short walking distance to explore all about the history of Korea."
1027,4.0,It's a lovely place for selfie lovers. Especially when you dressed up in Hanbok and experience your time in the palace.
1028,4.0,"We took a free guided tour as it was offered at certain times, Interesting sights and very good with a guide that gives you information about the traditions and history of the place."
1029,5.0,This is a Wonderful experience that everyone should see when visiting Seoul. Many locals were dressed up in traditional Korean attire. The walk thru this place is very fascinating. The architecture is really a true work of art. The museum in the grounds was also a very memorable place to see.
1030,2.0,"Since the japanese destroyed all,it was rebuild.Notting much left inside but fancy woodwork.frankly i wasnt impressed much! If you skip it you wont miss much"
1031,4.0,"The view around the palace is so awesome, many tourists are wearing Hanbok, the place is a bit touristy, recommended to visit when you are in Seoul."
1032,5.0,The palace and the surrounding are well maintained and beautiful.  It’s free entry if you wear the traditional Korean dress or hanbok. There are many rental shops nearby. It is also a fun experience to wear the traditional dress walking around the palace.
1033,5.0,"the view is simply stunning. i went there in nov and there r red leaves. amazing. if u r lucky enough, visit the secret garden as well. we cant get the tix though as they r sold out - we wanted the guided tour, and that needs online registration which has quota. i guess the pics i took simply couldnt capture the beauty. go there yourself to find it out"
1034,5.0,Not expensive (almost 3 USD) and you will enjoy it a lot! Also you can join a free tour guide (English) and learn everything about the palace and the king.  After the tour you can stay there admiring all the palace and it is near of other sightseen sites.
1035,4.0,"Main palace of the Joseon Dynasty and built in the 14th Century. The palace grounds are vast and the national museum for palaces is situated in its grounds near Heungnyemun Gate (main gate). The entrance fee is quite cheap only 3000 won or free if you arrive wearing traditional Korean clothing such as a Hanbok. This activity is definitely something you should do when it is a dry day and it is near other sites like Samcheong park, Changgyeonggung palace and Deoksugung park. Plenty of other places, street food, restaurants in and around the area so you can make a big day of it. We made a big day of it visiting both palaces, once in traditional hanbok and once not and we got some great food including Gyeranbbang (egg bread) and chicken ginseng and looking around the local shops and markets."
1036,5.0,"Wonderfull Palace and a discovery of the Korean culture and traditions, it was really interesting and beautifull. Definitely you can spend some time here and enjoy the moment..."
1037,4.0,I guess everyone who goes to SoKor gets to see this place. Those who love k-drama will definitely enjoy the visit. The area is huge and having a tour guide makes going around more convenient.
1038,4.0,"If you only have time to view the famous changing of guards, you do not need to purchase the admission fees to the palace. For those who rented traditional Korean costume and wish to take more pictures within the huge grounds of the palace, you will need to purchase entrance tickets. The changing of guards is an impressive ceremony and worth the wait."
1039,5.0,"The changing of the Guard is very impressive!... With their traditional blue and red uniforms, colorful flags and traditional weapons, it kind of takes you momentarily back into the past. And the end you even get to take pictures with some of the guards, making the event more memorable and a part of the visit not to be missed. The architecture of Palace is beautiful. Within it's nice and well maintained garden, a there's an uncountable number of buildings, which in some places lead your eyes to a perfect fusion of pointy rooftops, and overhangs decorated in predominantly green colors, as well as interior ceilings decorated in perfect details. With many people visiting on a Saturday, it was sometimes a bit difficult to take pictures in the most popular spots, but Koreans are very nice and cooperative people, hence no problem. A lovely place to visit, an experience not to be missed!..."
1040,4.0,This is the only tour we did guided in Seoul. The rest of the attractions we went to unguided. Korea has such a great history 6ou have to get the guided tour to bring everything together. Must see. 1000 there is a changing of the guard ceremony which I highly recommend. Great tour.
1041,5.0,"If you only have time to visit one palace in Seoul, then go to the Gyeongbokgung Palace, which is found in the Seoul City center. We were very fortunate to arrive right before the changing of the guard, which was an experience in itself. The place is huge, so make sure you wear comfortable shoes. We went during this year's cherry blossom season (April 11, 2018) when cherry blossom trees were in full bloom, which made the palace grounds even more picturesque. Rent a traditional Korean outfit (Hanbok) and admission to the palace grounds is free. Children and students have discounted entrance fees as well.  For those who are Kdrama fans (especially of Goblin, which starred Gong Yoo), this is where the female lead Ji Eun-Tak came out of in Seoul when she first went through that famous red door (in Canada)."
1042,4.0,"We happened to chance upon the palace after finishing our meal at Tosokchon Samgyetang for our ginseng chicken. Definitely worth a visit, palace was beautiful and well maintained. Would recommend coming early in the morning to avoid crowds and if you want a picture with the palace guards. Try and catch the change of guards that happens around 10am."
1043,5.0,Amazing historic landmark. A must-see. Join one of the tours given by student volunteers. Really great to see the pride and knowledge the youth have for their history. Very friendly and welcoming staff. Be sure to visit the gift shop for unique palace replica mementos and refreshing teas in the cafe within the shop.
1044,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the places to visit in Seoul. It’s a must see place on your visit and gives you a real taste of history. It’s around 3,000 KRW to enter but if you turn up wearing a traditional Hanbok, which many do for great photographic opportunities, you can get in for free. Be sure you watch one of the two daily changing of the guard ceremonies. A great spectacle. Also, be sure to confirm opening times as it closes a couple of day per week. Enjoy."
1045,4.0,"Such a rich historical site in Seoul, a lot of travelers visited Gyeongbokgung Palace that day even it was a winter. I took many photos and memories. You can find hanbok (traditional dress) rental around and enter the palace for free. Very recommended."
1046,5.0,"One your trip to Seoul you have to visit one of the palaces. This one is the biggest. I’d describe it more like a compound . In that it has many buildings and courtyards within the outside walls. The cost is just a few dollars to enter the main gate. You will likely see folks dressed in traditional Korean attire waking around taking pictures etc. it’s popular to do, and encouraged in that they get in free if they are dressed accordingly. We saw at least two wedding parties taking photos there. There are English translations on most displays. I believe you can rent audio guides if you want. The palace grounds are large, with ponds and courtyards. It’s a very night stroll around to check it all out."
1047,5.0,"While mechanical problems in Seattle caused us to miss our connection to India, the 24 hour delay awaiting our next connection opportunity gave us an awesome chance to see some of Korea. The first stop on our free layover tour provided by Incheon Airport was Gyeongbokgung Palace. Steeped in history, and quite well preserved, the Palace grounds we found were quite large, and filled with palace structures and artifacts. The interiors of the palace were quite well preserved, awash in colored interior spaces, and the palace was teaming in costumed Korean soldiers of around 16th century Korea.  The changing of the guard ceremony happens in the afternoon, and it's quite a flamboyant spectacle with many costumed participants. The ceremony lasts around a half an hour, and is well worth a pic or two. To add to the historical flavor, many locals come in costume to the Palace, and parade around the grounds. I had heard many weddings also take place at the Palace, however, that was just traveler talk, nothing from anyone official.  Self guiding audio tours with earbuds are available in many languages at the entry, and there seemed to be an ample supply. As far as entry costing goes, I have no idea, as it was included in our airport layover tour.  We found it worth the effort, and would recommend it to anyone exploring Seoul."
1048,4.0,"We went to see the changing of the guard at 9:00 a.m. Very nice presentation, with dozens of elaborately, historically dressed soldiers.  The Palace complex is a grand, interesting sight, but that’s about it. As a foreign tourist who has a limited knowledge of Korea, I couldn’t quite appreciate the history by walking around looking at buildings. Most viewing was only from the outside, except occasionally being allowed to look inside a door or window. Nearby was the Korean National Folk Museum, which focused more on the Korean way of life, including the evolution of the clothing, cooking, farming and family upbringing."
1049,5.0,"Seoul has about 5 palaces to see but gyeongbokgung is the most interesting for me. It is situated in an area surrounded by a Mountain View with nearby places like museums, restaurants and the bukchon hanok village. Experience the changing of the guards at 11am and 2pm."
1050,5.0,"My friends and I were limited with time so we went to the most touristy of the touristy and it did not disappoint. Although it rained and stayed cloudy for the rest of the day (so there wasn’t a changing of the guards ceremony), it was breathtakingly beautiful. Every inch of the palace was photo-worthy. What I loved the most was that it was free to enter if you rented a hanbok!"
1051,4.0,"Visited 20 yrs ago. A v quite palace but now a bit crowded. Visitors wearing traditional Korea costume, taking fotos everywhere, esp under the cherry tree. A bit annoying"
1052,4.0,"Nice to see a palace from Joseon Dynasty, I watched Korean drama and Joseon Era is always shown. Nothing much to see inside, the fee was $3; some people dressed up in hanbok dresses and walked around the palace and take pictures. The change of guards was great to see, they do it every half hour."
1053,4.0,"The Palace is beautiful. Our tour guide, with quite a sense of humor, did a great job explaining the history and present-day status of the palace. There as a medium-sized crowd overall, and good thing we had our jackets! It was cold!! The palace is worth visiting! Truly iconic! If you have limited time, be sure to add this to your tour list! Lots of nearby restaurants too. The mountain scenery is breathtaking!"
1054,5.0,"This palace is very large and grand. It was nice catching the performance of the changing of guards. If you missed the performance here, you can catch another one at Deoksugong. Our Chinese guide for the free tour impressed us with her good language skills and extensive knowledge. We learnt a lot about the Korean history and culture. The visit will not be half as good without the guide, it would just be buildings of which we would know little about. To take the tour, wait at the appointed time at the black stand just after the entrance. Highlights were the building in which Korean language Hanggul was invented by King Sejong (although original is no longer there), pavilion with rows of cherry blossoms in front of lake, hidden dragons at the main shrine hall, the decorated main chimney chute for emissions from ten rooms. Other than that the rest are similar to the other palaces. Each palace has a different history and usage, we visited each one in the combined pass each time taking the guided tour and it was still interesting. Don’t miss out the Korean folk museum and the north village which have free admission and are connected to the palace."
1055,5.0,"Definitely a must visit place in Seoul. Such a beautiful and huge palace. I do recommend to get a tour guide to understand better, unless you want to freely wander around."
1056,4.0,"Out of four palaces, Gyeongbukgong is the main palace. What I love about this place, it was easy to find when you exit Gwanghwamun Station. It was so big and can be seen far away. The changing guard ceremony will be held at 10 am on the front lawn."
1057,5.0,"The place is really big, was there just as the guards switched and was very nice. Most Korean wore traditional clothing which was nice too. Would definitely recommend a visit when you’re in Seoul."
1058,5.0,"I had been to Seoul many times, but never able to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace. Glad I did this last trip. They have free guided tours in English which last and hour which was helpful in learning more about the palace and grounds. The changing of the guard ceremony happens at 10 and 2."
1059,5.0,"It was worth paying that 3000w we paid for each person. We had a long walk, good thing we went towards the end of winter so walking was not a problem since the weather was very good!!! Its nuce too that ladies wear the hanbok and the setting was perfect. Beautiful sceneries and architecture"
1060,5.0,A must visit place in Seoul and main attraction palace ... It is a good initiative that people who dressed in Korean hanboks received free entrance to the palaces during the day ...
1061,4.0,Buildings are awesome and is one of the top attractions in Seoul. It;s kind a similar to Changdeokgung Palace. It;s huge and is amazing.
1062,5.0,"Love the elevated man made lake as it is such a beautiful spot for a great picture! As it is ending of winter the time I visit, the trees are all bald out but it still looks pretty in the photos. Am sure when spring with all the beautiful leaves and flowers it would look magnificent."
1063,5.0,"If you have been to the Forbidden City in Beijing, you will be more tolerant of this rebuilt collection of buildings that is the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Some reviewers complain there isn't much to see here. But I guess it depends upon what your goals are.Yes, the buildings are mostly closed or empty. But the way the palace is built with exposure to weather with unheated buildings, it is understandable why they won't be full of ancient artifacts. You'll find those in museums nearby. I have been here probably five times going back over 30 years, and I never cease to find it a place to calmly reflect on Korea's ancient and interesting history as a keystone located in the heart of East Asia. Additionally, you will find two great museums within its boundary. A great place for leisurely walks and quiet thinking (except on Korean holidays!)."
1064,4.0,"Generally, all 4 main palaces in Seoul look the same. If you do not have enough time, Gyeongbokgung should be your first choice. Be there before 10am to watch guard ceremony, recommend to stay 2-3 hours."
1065,5.0,"Located in the center of the city, its beauty will attract everyone. I went there in the afternoon and it was great. We can feel the ancient times and we will be amazed with the structure and paintings in their details! You can get free ticket also if you go there in hanbok (Korean traditional clothes)!"
1066,4.0,"This is my 2nd visit to the palace , Gyeongbokgung palace was the biggest , 1st visit was with tour guide and he will explain section by section of the palaces , my 2nd visit was on our own , we didn't go inside the palace this time , instead strolling around outside the palace which was beautiful too and it's free . Admiring ladies wearing beautiful Hanbok . If you wear Hanbok korea traditional clothes admission is free for men & ladies ."
1067,2.0,I visited this palace today.  Wow - how boring can a palace be! This one takes the biscuit!! Lots of Koreans all garbed up in traditional Korean dress which they hire locally - even men so they get free admission. Selfies are the order of the day. We maybe just a bit of glamour.  Let's get down to hard facts. Lots of buildings - most closed with nothing to see. Those open / nothing inside - again empty rooms - nothing to see. Exceptions: the throne room has a throne in - basic and the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion is of national significance for its important part in architectural design and application.  This is not a place to visit even if it only costs 4000 won.  The National Palace Museum of Korea is in the same compound (admission free) is excellent. So head there when disillusionment overcomes you from your Palace experience.
1068,2.0,Visited this palace in end Feb and a huge part of the palace is under renovation. Will not recommend visiting until renovations are over
1069,5.0,Great place to spend and hour or so looking around. Very beautiful in every season even in the rain. Highly recommend spending a day looking at all the palaces in Seoul!
1070,4.0,"My sister and I visited Gyeongbokgung, once without a hanbok (entrance fee is 3000krw/person if I'm not mistaken) and again with hanbok (free entry) for the fun of it. Visitors are not allowed to enter any of the buildings which are empty, however are free to walk everywhere. Everything is outdoor... The weather was pretty cold when we were there. The cafe and gift shop was our temporary hideout for snacks and hot tea. There are free English tours available at certain times during the day. We did not join the tour due to the cold weather. The guards change ceremony is also interesting to watch. This was one of the busiest palace we visited during our trip. We spent about 2-3 hours here."
1071,5.0,"It was a very interesting experience We enjoyed watching the changing of the guard and hearing the history if the palace. We chose to rent Korean dress and walk around which wass fun. I would encourage this as many people chose to take their pictures with us. It is amazing how large this palace is. Unfortunately the weather was cold when we visited but it didn't dampen our experience.  If you do go, there are not many places to eat in the area, so eat before you go to it."
1072,5.0,Amazing built of palace! A lot of foot exercise but its worth every single step!  We walked from our Hotel Metro to the palace via Gwanghwamun. It was a FOC visit for us due to the Seollal (:  For early birds: - there is 2 different ceremonies.  0940 - there is a rehearsal of changing guards ceremony inside the palace.  1000 - Heungnyemun changing of guards ceremony.  1100 - Gwanghwamun changing of guards ceremony.
1073,3.0,It is worth the visit if you go early morning to catch the 1st changing guard ceremony. If not there is not much to see inside just many buildings and they are all the same.
1074,5.0,My favorite place in Seoul. It's so rich in culture that I could stay the whole day and still not see and learn enough. A MUST go!!! 😄
1075,4.0,"Look, if y’all want to came here it better be on fall- early winter.  The palace was huuuugee and so instagram-able. The guard swith show was one to watch!"
1076,4.0,Every time someone wanted me to play tour guide in Seoul I took them to the palace. It’s big and there’s a great museum inside it. It’s good for a walk or a rest during the summer. I’ve taken a nap there after reading a nice book. It’s peaceful and affordable. Definitely a lot to look at and a lot of history going on. Not a 5 because I’m comparing it to the forbidden city in my mind. This is wayyyyy smaller and not a full day activity. Still a great part of an itinerary. Don’t miss it
1077,4.0,"if you take the subway directly to gyeongbokgung palace stop, near the exit to the palace, we were fortunate to meet a group of middle school students who are part of a cultural society offering free tours in English to foreigners. We gladly accepted their offer and had an awesome tour with great explanation! On top of the reasonably priced entrance tickets, the tour was a cherry on top!"
1078,4.0,"Tickets were considerably cheap for adults as it only costs 3000 krw entry. We went pretty early, arriving at 9.50am. Luckily for us, we were just in time to spectate a guard changing ceremony at the front gate. My sister was wondering if the guards had real or drawn on mustache. Who knows? We had a lot of fun wandering through the castle grounds making lots of guesses to what each building was for. If you want, you could request for an english speaking tour guide at the front. Me and my sister managed to listen in to other's english speaking tour guides, but it was all more fun when we had to guess. A lovely place to wander in and spend a good 1-2 hours with lots of picturefriendly spots. I imagine it would've been more lovely in spring as a lot of the trees and flower shrubs were quite bare at the moment due to the not-forgiving weather. We would've hired a hanbok, however it was way too cold for us to bare."
1079,5.0,Super beautiful and huge. I would recommend visitors to wear a traditional hanbok (rental is available around this area!) to go to the palace as the entrance fee will be free and you'll be able to feel like one of the people living in the joseon dynasty! a really good place to visit especially if you're interested in Korea's history. :)
1080,5.0,Very near the President' s house. Beautiful landscaping and the changing of the guards is something to see
1081,5.0,"Our tour guide from Here Travel Korea brought us here to visit the palace and learn more about the Korean history. It was huge and indeed, an amazing sight during the winter. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and shared with us the history of the palace, the building structures, etc."
1082,4.0,The palace is huge and not at all stroller friendly.There are lots of stairs not suitable for strollers. Can get very crowded. We did the English guided tour which provided us some good insight. There were guards standing at the main gate and everyone was clicking photos with them. Very well connected to the subway.
1083,4.0,Great to visit if you do the guided tour. It is a large compound and you do not get as much out of it walking around on your own without the guide.
1084,4.0,"The day I visited the palace was -15 degree so I didn’t really taking my time to stroll around as I would do to other sightseeings, but I really love the blue sky on the cold days. It is a beautiful place and you can go to the National Folk Museum Korea without charge but when you re-enter the palace, remember to show the ticket you purchased from the main gate of the palace. There are free English tours offered at the sign on the right after you enter the ticketed gate. I didn’t join the tour since I was at the palace at 12:30pm and the next English tour is at 1:30pm."
1085,4.0,We arrived to the palace as the free tour was about to take place. The tour goes for around an hr to an hour and a half. The tour guide was very well knowledgeable and lead the tour in an interesting way. I was never once felt bored or disinterested.  The palace is a beautiful place with lots of photo opportunities if you decide to dress up. The tour take you to the main areas but there a plenty of other area to explore.
1086,4.0,"We visited the Palace on 16 Dec and it was freezing though the sun was shining brightly. Before we arrive at the Palace, we were greeted by 2 student volunteers who brought us to purchase our tickets and showed us around the palace and explained the history of the Palace to us. The free tour was awesome and educational!"
1087,4.0,"Enjoy the palace on snowy days, I think it is more beautiful that way. Atleast what my family & I did!  Only 4- because there is not much to see. When you are inside there may be a second museum which holds different event for different seasons. There you have to pay aswell, nothing is free in this world my sons."
1088,4.0,"Got to witness the “changing of the guard”. Although more theatrical than a Military Parade and Review I’ve seen in other countries, it looks more traditional."
1089,5.0,"Toured the palace on a very hot day. If travelling during July - August, Seoul gets very hot. Beautiful history, lovely palace."
1090,4.0,My daughter was awestruck on how a palace can be soo grand and soo big.. that was when she initially stepped foot on it after about 45 minutes of walking though. she said when will this end? ha! soo there you go.I as an adult was up for it but with teenagers you gotta whack the history of the place into thier heads.
1091,4.0,The palace is in Korea traditional architecture and is well maintained. There is a museum in the complex where you can get useful information about local life.
1092,5.0,A great place to visit and they offer free tours in English. It's beautiful and a great way to learn about Korean history. The changing of the guard is also very interesting. Although the tour was a bit too long for my 5 year old. If you go in winter dress warmly.
1093,5.0,"There is so much history in this palace. Take the audio tour and if you get the chance, watch the changing of the guards!"
1094,3.0,"It's an interesting place but although the site is ancient, the current remains are not so old. Going in the winter does not show it off as best as it could be."
1095,5.0,We decided to wear hanboks on the day that we visited Gyeongbukgung so we were able to enter without paying the entrance fee. It was beautiful inside and well-laid out. I was amazed by the architecture and the grandeur of the place.
1096,5.0,"Nice to visit for a first time but probably not someplace to revisit again since there are other palaces as well. Palace grounds were quite large, but a lot of them were recently rebuilt and after awhile things started to look the same. If you wear a Hanbok you get in for free, else you pay KRW3000 per person (buy tickets at the ticket counter to the side before the entrance gates so don't line up directly at the entrance gates like we did)!"
1097,5.0,"If you're looking for a huge Palace to explore, this has to be your first stop. It's so vast that it took us an hour or so to explore. This place has many areas, that if you're looking for photo opportunities, just go further in. People usually gather in the front, taking photos, not knowing that they have so many chances to get better photos where it's not crowded further in. I went here in late November where the wind was strong, making the cold bearable, but uncomfortable on the face. Wrap up and bring chapstick! Additionally, I really think the admission price is worth it. 3000 Korean won for a big place to appreciate its architecture, landscape amd history is a win for me."
1098,5.0,They have guards at front gate. The buildings have been beautifully restored to its former glory. You will see a lot of locals dressed in historic outfits walking around. Apparently you can enter for free if you are wearing this. It is a large area so reserve at least two to three hours for your visit.
1099,5.0,Easy to get here in the metro and a short walk from/to Insa-Dong. This is an amazing retreat from the busy bustling city just outside the walls. The palace grounds are peaceful to wander independently or a self guided tour reading placards and handouts. I’m sure a guide would make it an even more incredible experience if you have time and the preference. Renting the Hanbok nearby makes for a fun photo shoot for some (makes for interesting people watching for others). Definitely worth the trip and a great place to bring visitors if you are living in the area. Beautiful to see and accessible to other lovely areas to explore.
1100,5.0,"Very nice to visit. I visited during a long lay over. Would recommend to do same.  Extremely traditional and picture perfect.  Exactly what you expect when in Seoul. Also, as opposed to my normal dealings, I bought some very nice souvenirs in the souvenir shop."
1101,4.0,Gyeongbokgung Palace is huge. We couldn’t see everything even though we were in 2 hours. And I think if you wanna go the palace you should wear sneaker 👟. Gyeongbokgung Palace is worth seeing. You can feel you are in Korean historical drama🤣
1102,4.0,Very convenient to get there via the subway. Just alight at Gyeongbokgung station and follow the signages.  The outer court is free of charge. But you need to purchase tickets in order to visit the inner courts. The building architecture is amazing and absolutely a great place for photo-taking with family and friends. The place is huge so be prepared to do a bit more walking.
1103,4.0,1. Get the Hanbok for rental and get free entrance to the palace. 2. Enter the palace. 3. Find out the timing of change of guards and be there to witness the change.
1104,5.0,This is a must when you visit South Korea!! Be sure to catch the shows offered at 10 AM and 2 PM — gives great insight to the Korean culture. Traditional Korean attire is available for rental at nearby shops — feel free to rent one for the full experience.
1105,5.0,"This palace is really beautiful and really huge. Even though there was a lot of people, you can just turn a corner and found out you are alone in this place filled with history. Do take the guided tour although my tour guide was not really that good. After that, do take your own time exploring the palace. The gardens are especially gorgeous during the autumn season. Do not miss the guard changing ceremony."
1106,5.0,"This palace is a must-visit if you're in Seoul! I'm so glad my fiancé and decided to check it out, because it was definitely one of my favorite parts of our trip. The palace is massive and so beautiful! We were a little short on time when we visited, so I'd suggest giving yourself two hours to visit. There is also a metro stop right inside of the palace - Gyeongbokgung Station."
1107,3.0,Our guide was bad and the famous Hyangwonjeong Pavilion was closed for renovation. I wish my family would have gone in ourselves and read the signs and blocks patiently rather than joining the free tour. It was morning and it spoiled our day. Positive note : the Changing of Guards were nice
1108,5.0,"We visit the palace during autumn where the tree start to turn orange and yellow. Many people wear traditional korean costumes making the place more special. the palace is quite big and need 1-2 hours to walk around, or even spend more times when you like to see it in a more detail ways."
1109,4.0,"In every city that you visit, there is always that one place you have to go to otherwise you cant really say that you have been to that place. And I think for Seoul, its this place.  On our itenerary, originally we were to visit palaces during a Sunday but because the DMZ tour was fully booked on our scheduled day, we had to rearrange our schedule. So we decided Monday for palaces. Big mistake since all the palaces were closed on Mondays EXCEPT for this one. And we were exceptionally happy that we were lucky enough that this wasnt closed on a Monday because we would have been missign a lot.  Now, we went by ourselves to this palace. And I think this place would be visited best with a guide to explain what the buildings were and their importance. When we visited the Forbidden City in Beijing we did so and it was extremely insightful and I wish we did the same when we went to Gyeongbokgung.  Now if your here just for some photo ops wearing hanboks, then you wont really care for that tour but for someone who likes history do hire a guide.  For photo ops, autumn is a great time for that. The golden tres juxtaposed with the palaces would really lool great wearing your rented hanbok."
1110,4.0,"It is a crowded tourist place. Nice to see the guard changing ceremony. Visitor is allowed only to see the outside of the buildings inside the palace. not all of the buildings are accessible, the huge lands are only accessible for certain parts only. The most disappointing aspect is that this palace was destroyed so many times and the buildings seen today is recent. And not 1000 +++ old."
1111,4.0,With splendid palaces and pagodas donning this palace one is taken back in time as one strolls through this complex. The best part of the visit is the traditional guard changing ceremony! And one can get clicked with them once they have taken their place. Would be even better if one can get a hanbok to move around and have that authentic feel.
1112,5.0,"One of the biggest palace.  Rent a hanbok, stroll the palace and take pictures. Free entrance if wearing hanbok.  Come on weekdays."
1113,4.0,"The nearest metro station is Gyeongbukgung Station on Line 3.  This Palace is an impressive set of buildings. It was built three years after the founding of the Joseon Dynasty. It has an interesting history. It was destroyed during the Japanese invasion in the 16th century. It was rebuilt in 1867. It was again destroyed by Japanese occupation in 1915 and replaced with the headquarters of the Japanese government. The present Korean government has embarked on an ambitious restoration project started in 1990 to bring the palace to its former glory.  The backdrop to the palace is Mount Bugak.  The main entrance to the palace is through Gwanghwamun Gate. There is a colourful changing of the guard ceremony held every morning.  Within the grounds are the National Folk Museum of Korea and the National Palace Museum of Korea. Also, the offices of the King and the Korean state officials are located within the outer court of the palace walls. The inner court has the residences for the royal family. The Queen’s palace and the Crown Prince’s palaces are within the main Gyeongbokgung palace.  Admission for adults are 3,000 Won (equivalent to about GBP2.00 Aug 2017). In the summer months of June, July and August, the opening hours are 9am to 6.30pm – and the last admission is one hour before closing time. It is closed on Tuesdays  There are facilities for the disabled like free wheelchair rental, parking access, ramps and toilets."
1114,5.0,"This is a place for those who loves historical events. It is a Palace which was been restored under many challenges. Must congratulate the government and the people of South Korea whom had done a really good job. This Palace was built during the Jeoseon Dynasty and had been serving about 27 Kings during the old days. The tour will takes about an hour and a half, we will have the opportunity to explore every building originally occupied by the King, The Queen, and all of their day to day labour. Please come before 11am, as by then, the ceremonial Changing Of Guard will be diaplayed. You can enjoy the show, as it is being done with the most traditional way. Every details were being presented as if we are “back in time”. Enjoy guys!!"
1115,5.0,"This palace is the largest of the five palaces in Seoul, and definitely worth the visit. We toured it during a hanbok festival weekend, so it was very crowded, but the crowds were largely composed of Koreans in traditional dress, and it was a cool experience in itself to see that. I really enjoyed this palace and would recommend it.  The guards out front are a great photo op."
1116,4.0,Super love this place. Its beautiful and not so crowded compared to other palace in Seoul. Would come back again for sure.
1117,5.0,"This was a great place to walk about. We visited all of the palaces in about 5 hours time during a Saturday afternoon. So peaceful and a great break from the busy City. All of the building look very similar, but the grounds are worth a look. It was a great afternoon."
1118,4.0,"The Guards change ceremony was much better than the one at Deoksugung palace. We bought the royal pass (10,000 won for adult, 5000 won for kids) which includes admission tickets for Deoksugung palace, Gyeongbokgung palace, Changdeokgung palace (inclusive of secret garden admission), Changgyeonggung palace and Jongmyo Shrine. If you have time for only one palace, go to Gyeongbokgung palace if you would like to see the Guards exchange ceremony and experience a traditional Korean tea and snacks served the royal style."
1119,4.0,The palace is a vast place to cover. You have to walk a lot to see the sprawling palace and other places located. There is an entry fee. But it is worth the money. You can easily spend around 3 to 4 hours.
1120,5.0,"Honestly, the best tourist destination spot I’ve been in Korea. The view of the mountains is amazing. I was in awe throughout the entire time I was there. I highly recommend to rent out the Hanbok from nearby shops for around KRW 10,000-20,000 then go around the palace and take beautiful photos! Getting there is also easy! Google it and you can get the directions there"
1121,4.0,"If u are hanging around seoul u must visit this place, and if u rent an hanbok it will be even better :)"
1122,4.0,"Possibly the largest of the five main palaces in the centre of Seoul, Gyeongbokgung has a lot to see, but it's all rather 'samey'. The original palace is long gone and like the other four, this is a recreation that was redone in 2007. It's hard to imagine the original palaces were as drab and austere as the recreations, but I definitely don't believe they all had exactly the same brickwork, exactly the same woodwork and all had exactly the same paint jobs. The result is that as you wander around, you just see the same thing over and over. Like all the other palaces, you cannot enter any of the buildings. Two of the largest buildings have open doors so you can see inside, but that's as close as you get. The Hyangwonjeong Pavilion is completely closed for renovation as of October 2017 and you can only visit the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion if you have pre-booked (and presumably paid a separate fee). Make sure you buy the Palace Pass for W10,000 as that will give you a big discount on the five palaces and the shrine that it covers. If you turn up in traditional Korean clothing, you get in free (that's true of all the palaces). However, since you have to pay W10,000 for four hours to rent the costume, it's no saving at all."
1123,5.0,"It’s a must to visit this palace. The palace overview the mountain(not sure what’s the name) and it’s was breathtaking. We actually rented the Hanbuk, so we could feel how it’s like to be in a royal family 👸🏻👸🏻 we did a mini photoshoot in the palace itself. You will be mesmerised by it."
1124,4.0,"Although I think there are some other palaces in the world are bigger, but still I enjoyed the visit here. It was South Korea's national holiday when we visited so was super crowded though"
1125,4.0,"First to saw that you can spend one-two hours here if it is not a really hot day. Go EARLY in the morning because the summer heat and humidity will drain all your energy. You'll be mostly in the sun.  This is a free attraction and we enjoying it. We got there on as part of a bus tour. I suggest you go by yourself and NOT as part of a bus tour so you can see it at a more leisurely pace and not be rushed by trying to keep up with a tour guide.  It is very colorful and unique. They keep it clean and shinny. Lots of history here and you will do a lot of walking because it is a large area. Although there are MANY people on any given day, it isn't very crowded because the area is so large.  The guard changing ceremony reminds me of London, but I like this better. Definitely worth your time."
1126,5.0,Gyeongbukgung Palace is worth spending 1-2 hours at. It has beautiful buildings. We also watched the changing of the guards ceremony. After that we tried on the guards costume for free (you can wear for 5-10 minutes).
1127,4.0,"I especially love the change of guard, rich in tradition. Enjoyed looking at the display of traditional Korean outfits, worn by locals and tourists alike. Had a pleasant walk throughout the vast complex. The palace itself was impressive. It was en enriching experience."
1128,5.0,"Enjoyed walking around the various palace sites, although it was really crowded with many people (both locals and foreigners) wearing hanboks and taking photos around the palace. The area with the pond area was especially pretty!"
1129,5.0,"Here is one of the must-visit places in Seoul. It is well organized for visitors with resting places, guidance signs and free guided tours. Dedicate at least half day. Area is quite big including several palaces for royal dynasty of Korea."
1130,5.0,"beautiful place. took me a long time to actually get there but it was great. the grounds are so pretty. standard entry is 3,000₩ (free if you wear a hanbok so you'll likely see lots of ppl running around in them which is cool)  as you walk further into the palace you can see the mountains and if you look back you'll see the city which is like the most seoul thing ever.  they serve tea in the library and other drinks in the cafe/souvenir shop (most upwards of 5,000₩).  i finally got there at almost 11 -quite busy, the grounds are big though so getting shots without other people is possible. i put it into my itinerary as a quick morning activity and didn't end up leaving until just after noon so make the time if you're the type to want to explore every corner of a place, it really is huge."
1131,4.0,"This in some ways has some of the strengths of the forbidden city, without the traffic and air quality woes. Unfortunately they do not have the nice displays of palace furniture, art objects and treasures that the forbidden city has. Still impressive, but could be so much more. Perhaps these items are in other museums? If so they should be repatriated for the Korean people"
1132,5.0,"If you rent/wear hanbok (Korean traditional clothes) in Seoul. You can enter in any of their major Palaces for free.  It's not a bad idea. And the clothes are super comfortable and beautiful. My friends and I rented our hanbok in Myeongdong area (onedayhanbok.com), then took a cab (or take the trains) to Gyeongbokgung.  The palace is a huge compound of traditional Korean architecture. Take your time in walking around."
1133,3.0,Offers some interesting insight on Korean history and the nobles that use to live in this palace. They have free tour guides in English.
1134,5.0,"Be ready to walk a lot. The place is huge. Drinking water availabe in fountains. Went in september and weather was great. Bring cap/hat and sunscreen. The gardens are beautiful, the buildings are amazing specially the one with the lake around. Amazing photos. It will take you at least 4 hours."
1135,5.0,"Amazing scenery and ambience ! A must go when in Seoul and rich in history as well! Tickets for foreigners costs 3,000KRW per adult and for kids it's 2,500(I think). They are free guided tours in English , Chinese , Japanese and Korean and stipulated timings as well. Do note it closes on Tuesdays!"
1136,5.0,"It was a great experience - learning about the rich history and culture, and different dynasties in Korea's history such as Goryeo to Joseon periods, understanding the early Chinese & Japanese influence and development of the Korean alphabet and language. It all helps to someone like me who also appreciate Korean period dramas. The changing of guards performance was colorful and interesting.  It's a huge place so alot of walking is required. I was glad that the weather was perfect that morning - cool and slightly windy. I also made the right decision to join a guided tour and was rewarded with a pleasant and patient tour guide who not only speaks English well but has a great understanding of Korean history. All said, I had enjoyed the tour tremendously and would certainly recommend it !"
1137,4.0,"Huge palace! One of the bigger tourist-draws, so it's often more crowded than a lot of the other palaces. They give free tours in English (and some other languages) at set times throughout the day, which are fun but a bit slow. (My guide was really nice, there's just a lot of extra time given for people to take pictures at each building.)  If you're interested in the surrounding museums (which I've heard great things about) or specific on-site attractions, like the library or the gardens, call ahead as they have separate hours than the Palace."
1138,4.0,"Similar in style to other Seoul palaces, Gyeongbokgung differs in size and the extensive complex of palace buildings and compounds. There is much to see here so it is best to allow at least two hours to explore. I recommend entering through the main gate and exiting at the rear of the grounds to ensure you don't miss the beautiful book room and final home complex of the revered empress. The walk back from the rear of the grounds takes you past a number of small art galleries. Avoid the weekend if possible as there are many tour groups."
1139,5.0,be prepared to walk a lot. Its beautiful palace with rich history. I really enjoyed it. It could get hot so do carry umbrella
1140,5.0,"A visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of those things you do in a lifetime that stick in your memory for the rest of your life. What a stunning palace and what an amazing opportunity for anyone to learn so much about a country's history that no school would ever teach. Visiting this palace was one of the best things I have ever done for myself. This visit made me realize just how little we learn about Asian history in the West and I lamented this but welcomed and enjoyed the opportunity to remedy this sad reality at least a little by learning as much as I could.  I was so impressed by the meticulous care of this historical place. Authorities in Seoul ought to be applauded for their exceptional care of this historical jewel. This is not a place you can visit in just an hour or two. Take your time! See all the details, read everything, learn and enjoy! It'll transport you to ancient times long gone and to such a different culture and world you could never imagine unless you went there yourself. We spent an entire day here and loved everything, from the unique and delicate gardens, to the royal chambers of the king, the superb collections of antiques that show different times in Korean history. The pagodas are exquisite, the details of the architecture, even the small village of their servants provided a clear contrast that showed how differently their servants lived within the palace. We also marveled at the great contrast between this ancient structure next The the modern city surrounding it. Absolutely magnificent!"
1141,4.0,"This was our favorite palace to visit during the trip. It is the restored main royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. The architecture was awesome. Enjoyed walking through the various areas. Takes you back in history and people dressed in tradition dress added to the experience. There is also a museum. The palace museum and front area where the changing of the guards happens are free. However, to get into the main palace grounds there is an admission charge. Ticket was only 3,000 KRW when we were there."
1142,5.0,We visited the palace in April and had a great time. The palace is beautiful and huge! We didn't take a tour so we just wandered around at our own pace. It was awesome getting to watch the changing of the guard ceremony. It takes place several times throughout the day. Don't miss it!
1143,5.0,"I really enjoyed going to Gyeongbokgung. I actually met up with a friend there that I had met on a language exchange app but never met in real life, and we had so much fun! Because that friend insisted on paying for my ticket for me, I don't actually know how much it costs. But I found out from people there that if you go to one of the Hanbok (traditional Korean clothing) stores nearby and pay to rent Hanbok (which you can do, prices vary depending on the outfit you choose and how long you want to borrow it, I borrowed the ""cheap"" outfit for 2 hours and it was 20,000 Won (~$20)) you can enter the palace for free. So it was quite cool, as we walked around the palace, there were people everywhere wearing the traditional Korean palace clothing! Bless their hearts though, that day was HOT. If you come to the palace in the summer, be prepared for that... I was not... lol. Overall it's a gorgeous place to visit and a lovely walk during the day. There's a mini museum/cafe/information center/gift shop near the main building of the palace, so you can go there and enjoy some A/C if you're dying in the heat (like I was). There are also a lot of cute cafes and restaurants nearby that you can go to, with delicious food! Overall, I would recommend visiting this palace, but it's more fun if you go with a friend or a group for sure. :)"
1144,4.0,"Taken on a English language guided tour of the palace. The length of tour was about 60 minutes. The tour guide was knowledgeable and engaging. The guide whizzed us through the various parts of the palace and gave us a taste of the live of the King and Queen. After the tour, we retraced the path to truly enjoy the beauty of the palace. All in all, we spent 90 minutes to 2 hrs at Gyeongbokgung.  Oh, yes, the to guided tour is free and you can find out the tour schedule online.  Changing of the palace guard. The 15 minute ceremony was colourful, enjoyable and full of aplomb. A strategic location to site yourself is on the west side of the viewing area - the guards will march in from the East Gate and turn towards the South Gate."
1145,5.0,"I enjoyed learning about dynasties, intrigues in the palace and architecture. Secret Garden tour is beautiful and interesting as well."
1146,5.0,"Rented a handbook for 2 hrs for 10,000won. From a shop just across the road. Rented the cheapest so the design was much simpler than the more expensive ones at 30,000won. Both female and male handbook available.  Once you wear a handbook, entrance is free!!! Great time to photo shoot. Even locals wanted a picture with us may be because we were wearing our hijab with the Hanbok. The weather was hot and we were perspiring a lot in that thick and heavy hanbok. Bring your bottle of water along coz there isn't any shops inside the palace.  The palace is so huge, took us 2 hours to explore most of it. Taking into account our endless.phototaking hahaha.There's the exterior part, with a beautiful pond and am.overview of the mountain at the back."
1147,5.0,"The palace is very interesting, but also very crowded. The changing of the guard was pretty spectacular. Make sure you register for the free tour of the palace! Our guide was a young lady who spoke very good English and offered a lot of interesting information about the palace and about Korea. It was a very pleasant experience."
1148,5.0,We wandered round by ourselves and really enjoyed the tranquillity in this massive complex. A must do on your 1st trip to Seoul to appreciate the development of Korea as a nation
1149,5.0,"Gyeongbukgong Palace was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty, which already makes it worth a visit. The palace is quite big, and is a good cultural experience as you get to walk around palace grounds and learn more about Korean history."
1150,4.0,"We were in Seoul on a family vacation and wanted to see one palace rather than visiting multiple ones. We were told that this one is the biggest palace and it happened to be very close to our hotel (the wonderful Four Seasons Seoul). So we ended up walking (which was so convenient). We loved seeing the changing of the guard. The costumes, the drums, the ceremony - it was all wonderfully memorable, dramatic and enjoyable. We loved seeing various visitors dressed in traditional Korean attire. Afterwards, we walked around the vast palace. There's a roped off area that you need to purchase tickets in advance to enter (we didn't know that, which was kind of a bummer, as we would have liked to go into that part of the palace). Overall, we're glad that we went to this palace, since we only had time to visit one while in Seoul. Nearby there is a historic street that shows Korean streets as they looked in the past. Also nearby is the folk museum but unfortunately we didn't have time to go there."
1151,4.0,"Interesting place. Extensive walking, so be prepared. If it's hot, be sure to have water. Changing of the guard ceremony is interesting & colorful."
1152,4.0,"We spent a Sunday afternoon visiting the palace on an English guided tour. The tour lasted around an hour and towards the end we decided to break away from the Group as we had seen as much as we wanted to see. We found the Palace interesting in terms of its history and the tour, buildings, artwork, decorations made the visit worthwhile despite it being very hot, humid and wet."
1153,5.0,"It would take at least a couple of hours on a moderate pace to go around the complex. It also makes one think how patriotic the South Koreans are, looking at groups and families whiling away a beautiful afternoon in the rain."
1154,5.0,"Lots to see. People in native dress. Opportunities to rent native dress. Many buildings and beautiful grounds. Very highly recommend, it was an amazing place!"
1155,5.0,"The palace is one of the must visit sites for tourist coming to Seoul. To get the full traditional Korean experience, you can rent Hanbok (traditional Korean clothing) from many stores near the palace. During the summer, I recommend visiting the palace at night. You'll need to make reservation online, but the hassle is worth it. The views are much more scenic at night and the summer heat become more bearable (especially if you are wearing Hanbok)."
1156,4.0,"The imperial palace in Seoul down town is the last witness of the Korean story, in fact most of historical building were destroyed during Second World War. Well preserved, the building has more similarity with Forbidden city ad exception to color of the roof (bue in Korea and red in Cina) and the symbol of the Korean Imperator Family. Inside to the palace there is the national museum where is summarized the Korean story. At the end of the visit there is the Blue Roof Palace where the president of Republic of south of Korea live."
1157,5.0,I will say it being located right in the middle of the city threw me off a little bit but this was a must stop for anyone going to Seoul.
1158,1.0,Not worth your time if you don't have that much time in Seoul. It is a replica most of the palace stuff have been reproduced.
1159,5.0,"We lived in Seoul for two years but this was always the palace we took guests too! It's location, museums, buildings, and ease of use make it the best to see. You can walk from the main entrance all the way through to the back and view the president's house. They have wonderful exhibits, it looks awesome in any season, and twice a year they have it open in the evenings with special light exhibits. Make sure to buy the 500w guidebook at least once because it contains excellent information to read as you walk around! The pagoda at the back of the grounds is my favorite and looks so cool with the changing seasons!"
1160,5.0,The place is awesome! Try to discover when it will be the change of the guard. It happens once at the morning and once at the afternoon. Just in the main entrance of the palace. You must see to learn about some history of Korea. The public transportation in Seoul is cheap and you can visited any place in this city! There are other atractions near by.
1161,5.0,"I used to live in Seoul for almost 3 years, and have visited 경복궁 for more than 10 times I guess. But this is my first time to wear hanbok(한복) to get into 경복궁, then it'll be free for the fee, what a nice and a special experience over there!"
1162,4.0,Lots to see. You can stroll at your own pace. Changing of the guard is interesting and the price is outstanding.
1163,5.0,"This is the only palace i have visited during my short korea trip. Reached there at 10am to see the guard changing ceremony. After the short ceremony, we signed up for about 15min free trying of royal guard uniforms at the left side of the gate. Took some photos in the uniforms around the gwanghwamun gate. Palace is very beautiful and huge. We could connect with the various sections of the palace that appeared in korean drama. It's uniquely korean to see many visitors in hanbok walking in the palace despite hot summer. Definitely a must-see place."
1164,3.0,"It is my humble opinion that you only need to see one palace in Seoul, and this is not the one you should see. Perhaps I was underwhelmed as it was our second palace of the day, but I kind of felt like I was at exactly the same place I had visited earlier that day even though it was a different palace and a new entry fee (admittedly very affordable)."
1165,5.0,"Was there last Sunday. Spent about 3 hours there and only did see a part of the whole thing. Have to visit again. A perfect place for photographers, as many people enter the area in old costumes in return for free entry and to be photographed by other tourists. The whole area is very picturesque and with many people in the costumes this is perfect for photographers."
1166,5.0,Beautifully restored palaces in the Center of Seoul. Defiantly worth the trip and the about 3$ of entrance fee.
1167,5.0,"Check out the palace and grounds. Allow about 2 hours and make sure to catch the changing of the guard. Afterwards, it's an easy walk to see the traditional homes of Bukchon Hanok Village. Weave your way down the hill and grab lunch at one of the many cafes."
1168,5.0,"This wonderful and large complex at the heart of Seoul is a must go for Korean drama enthusiasts, especially donning their own traditional Hanbok costumes. It is a wonderful destination to visit with all the palaces, amenities (both modern and traditional) and structures flanked in lush greens."
1169,4.0,"A nicely restored/preserved palace of Korea, the location is also quite convenient with easy access from Ankok Metro station. If you wear traditional Hanbok, you will be granted free access to the Palace."
1170,5.0,Must stop on your short or long stay in Korea. Beautiful grounds. Colorful palace and building. Amazing photo opportunities. Lots of folks choose to rent local traditional clothing. Dress like a king and get free entry. Makes it very attractive and lots of participants
1171,5.0,Visited the palace and managed to get in free as it was the last Wednesday of the month. The guard changing ceremony takes place twice a day (10am and 2pm) in the courtyard. It wasn't crowded and we took a leisure walk through the palace. There's also a little tea place within the palace if you want to drink tea or taste some royal snacks.
1172,5.0,One of historic places in Seoul that must be visited...A place where you can learn about the history of South Korean kingdom in the past
1173,5.0,"I have been to this palace three times so far. Last time I wore Hanbok. (by the way if you wear Hanbok, you can enter the palace for free) It is a beautiful place with a lake and sometimes you can see traditional ceremonies."
1174,5.0,A well known historical site for tourists to see in Seoul. The palace located in the center of the city. Easy to find by car bus or subway
1175,5.0,"Beautiful and very pleasant and interesting, easily accessible and very well maintained. Strongly recommended!"
1176,5.0,"From the National Folk museum, you can walk through the vast land area full of architectural buildings in an old Joseon era set up. One can guess that this is where historical Korean dramas are shot. Free guided tours are available in English. The place is good for photo op's & during our stay, most locals came with their traditional hanbok costume. 💕"
1177,5.0,Free if you wear a hanbok to the palace. Do check out this place.. big place with peaceful environment.
1178,4.0,"I don’t want to miss Gyeongbokgung Palace because it is the oldest and largest Seoul’s palace. The entrance fee is only 3,000 won but if you want to experience wearing Hanbok or Traditional dress you can rent for 30,000won + you can get a free entry discount. One more thing, don’t miss to watch the Royal Guard Changing Ceremonies. It is a great opportunity to experience a rare traditional scene in Korea."
1179,5.0,Caught the changing of guards. It was very well executed. Fun taking photos with the 'guards'. The palace is big and impressive. There is also a folk museum. It is of high quality. The children folk museum is also fun. The exhibits are interactive and well designed. Really surprised that for such a nice place it is free to visit for all.
1180,4.0,"The Palace ground is big, There are Korean's who dress in their national costumes who look so beautiful. At the ticket area, you will find some people who want to be a free guide to you to speak english. They will explain to you the history of the Palace. Inside there is also a National Palace Musem of Korea.  Take note that the guard changing ceremony is at 10.00 am & 14.00pm. The guard duty performance is @ 11.00 & 13.00pm ."
1181,4.0,"The palace grounds is very huge, and it is a great place for photo taking. Many tourists and locals, as well as students, visit the palace daily. The palace guards changing ceremony was interesting. It took place at around noon time. A small entrance fee is required to visit the palace."
1182,4.0,"Suggest to go visit during the morning or later in the afternoon. We went just after lunch and it was a really hot day at 30 degree Celsius. We were so tired and thirsty and have to rest every now and then after 30mins walking or so. Bring a cap/hat, sunglasses and water if you do go during summer or hot day!  Palace is huge and will be even more pretty I believe during the Autumn period. One can spend at least 3 hours covering the whole palace so it will be good to go during a cooler day. We did not wait for the guided tour as we did expect to spend more than 2 hours in the palace which in the end we did due to much walking and resting!"
1183,5.0,"This is a large complex of restored palace buildings that also includes two stand-alone museums, each of which would be a worthwhile attraction in their own right. The combination could easily occupy half a day or more and provides a great combination of history, art, and architecture. The one sight to see even with only a short time in Seoul.  Be aware that there are restoration works going on regularly, so there will be some construction fencing and inaccessible areas.  The changing of the guard ""show"" takes place in the main courtyard and so does not require admission--handy if you ""miss"" it due to schedule or weather and want to do it separately.  It is possible to combine it with the two ""C"" palaces in the area, but that would be a lot of walking and maybe an overload on ""restored palace"" experience."
1184,5.0,"The attraction is very well maintained. There are many tourists going around here. You will see many people wearing hanbok. This is quite interesting, and do not forget to watch the ceremony on the changing of the guards."
1185,4.0,The palace is worth the visit for its unique oriental buildings and its change of guards which matches that at the Buckingham palace. The rooms are empty so don't expect to see fine interiors.
1186,4.0,"Must see place to visit allow a couple of hours here to take in the culture, history and wander around exploring. The guards at the front seem to be more a tourist attraction with their stick on beards and more a part time job than others I have seen in London etc. Don't let this put you off thou as once inside you get to see and learn about the history of Gyeongbokgung Palace. Do make sure you take the free tour lasting just over an hour will give you a good insight into its history and best of all it is free, if you dress traditionally thou it is free entry, great to see so many doing it certainly adds to the atmosphere.  Like most places in Seoul it was cheap admission and certainly worth the cost."
1187,5.0,It's worth to get up early to watch the live Royal Guard changing ceremony and the free guided tours. The Korean female guides are very professional and patient in their sharing. Worth visiting!
1188,5.0,"This place is really busy at times, that busy that it is hard to get a good photo, it is pretty big to so make sure you have good walking shoes on and take water, you can not miss the changing of the guards at 11am 1pm and 3pm it good to watch."
1189,5.0,"Go there in the morning and catch the ""Changing of the Royal Guards"" which starts at 10 a.m. before exploring the large palace buildings. They are no less than stunning."
1190,5.0,Rent a hanbok from any of the hanbok stores nearby and get a ticket for free at the booth from the side. Otherwise you would have to pay a fee. Take pretty pictures with the hanbok though it might be hot wearing it.
1191,5.0,"a must visit when travelling to Seoul. As Joseon dynasty's main palace, it is one of the most preserved palace, beside Changdeokgung. It is always packed with tourist. you can visit the palace for free if you wear hanbok. To learn more about its history, you are suggested to join the palace guided tour."
1192,4.0,"Sunny day to walk, lot of visitors with hanbok (Korean traditional clothes) which you can hire from 15000 won for 4 hours, you can find the shops closed by to hire the clothes, inside the palace have a lot of places for photoshoot, it's a nice day out."
1193,4.0,If you can try to time your arrival to see the changing of the guard by the main gate. Its easy ti forget yoh are in a busy mordern city as you spend a couple of hours exploring the buildings and gardens in the palace grounds. Its well worth getting a guide to walk you through. Lical residents dress up in traditional costume which adds colour and charm to the experience. my puctures tell a better story than what I can describe. Well worth the visit
1194,5.0,"I've seen other palaces in Seoul but this one has a different beauty and character. You will imagine how grandeous of this palace in the past. You can see how the rulers lived and how they were served by their attendants. Somehow interesting. The gardens and the view of the mountain made the scenery more beautiful. It is a relaxing place to stop and reflect for a moment. You will consider the garden view as romantic, too."
1195,5.0,"One of the more popular palaces in Seoul, and it is a short walking to another travellers place known as Bukchon Village. Enter via the main entrance and you can see 'guards' dressed up in ancient times standing still, 'welcoming' you to it."
1196,5.0,Wonderful palace to see. Take a guide as you will miss so much without one. Went into the King court and bumped my head on the curved rock for the doorway. Please watch out for the as my head still hurts.
1197,5.0,"In terms of ""Palace Grounds"", I think this is the most beautiful.  I have read reviews that this place is nothing special and that there are many people walking around. Simply not true, well, the ""not special"" part anyway.  There will be lots of people walking around, its a main attraction when visiting Seoul so I'm not sure what why you would not expect this.  This place is great for photography. So many different types of plants and flowers and lots of buildings to walk around and explore.  Yo will see many people walking around in ""Hanbok"" which is a traditional dress of Korea. Colourful and beautiful imo.  Grab a leaflet at the start which includes a map, its free and will ensure that you don't miss anything. There is also a way to see the ""Blue House"" which is where the president resides. I missed this first time round.  Entrance is cheap and you can buy a drink and some snacks inside. I recommend taking a packed lunch, find a nice spot in the grounds and relax.  The changing of the guard is a must see.  A great day out for all."
1198,4.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is quite impressive. The area behind the (restored) front gate is public and you're able to watch the very nice Royal Guard Changing Ceremony even for free.  If you wanna enter the actual Palace ground it'll cost you the small entrance fee of about 3$ only. Sure worth it.The palace ground is quite big and impressive. Nice buildings and architecture. Lots of green areas as well. Many visitors are roaming the area in (mostly rented) Hanboks. A nice sight.  Like I said, don't miss out on the guard changing ceremony. The Royal Guards change at least at 2pm and 5pm. Before the ceremony you can watch them train, just outside the walls (eastside). We went on a weekday and got some good spots to watch, not many visitors. It's enough if you show up about 15-20mins before (at least in spring). You also can take some nice pics together with the guards just outside the main gate.  All in all a nice place to visit. A few minutes away only from the Bukchon Hanok Village, don't miss out on that one if you're in the area.  Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
1199,5.0,We get to see the guard changing shift at 10 am. It was an interesting ceremony ! The palace was big and there were many nice places for taking pictures. A great experience to visit the Palace when in Korea !
1200,4.0,"The palace gave an idea of life several 100 years ago. The pavilion in the centre of a lake was most attactive and, on the day I was there, was the background for wedding photos. We saw the colourful changing of the guard."
1201,4.0,This is a must see if you are interested in some culture while you are in Seoul. I suggest having a tour guide that can give you insight into the history. The changing of the guards is a nice ceremony and the art behind the King's chair are things not to miss.
1202,5.0,Very interesting area of kings palace. I visited similar in Tokyo but this has different spirit. I would recommend to visit it.
1203,5.0,"TIP: Before going check the time of the FREE MULTILINGUAL tours! They provide interesting backstory and add some richness to the experience - highly recommend.  We visited this place on a rainy day but it was still worth it. My mom and I came together because of the overwhelming reviews we read online but when we got here we were totally blown away. The structures were beautiful and in pristine condition, the backstories all interesting."
1204,5.0,"One of the grand palaces of South Korea. Very good place to visit, especially if you're looking for cultural exposure.  Reminder to either bring umbrellas, or use sunscreen or both. :)  It's also a bit (or a lot) of a walk inside so make sure you're wearing comfortable clothes and shoes. :)  It has a connection to the National Folk Museum so you can come out that end and continue on to Bukchon Hanok village. And, if you're still not tired, you can go ahead and walk to Changdeokgung Palace (it -is- far, but doable). ;)"
1205,4.0,"On tour, interesting to know the history of the palace. Fun to see a lot of people dressed in Korean outfit."
1206,5.0,"It's an hour+ and brings you to the key areas with stories and explanations, more than what I expected for a free tour. The guides are humorous and very friendly. Visit the palace website for timings."
1207,5.0,"As the main and biggest palace in Seoul, Gyeongbukgong is a must visit attraction. You can get in free if you're wearing a hanbok.  Got to see the changing of the guards at 10 am. I think it can be skipped, but if you're there anyway, it's still good to catch.  With a map/short guide available, one can go around on their own, but would advise to take a guided tour since they offer it free anyway.  It's a very big complex so it's best to wear comfortable shoes. Inside the complex is the National Folk Museum and you can get it there for free as well.  So many beautiful historical sites in this palace - architecture, design and nature in one. Placed against a lovely mountain background, you will understand why this site was chosen as the main palace."
1208,5.0,"Today I have visited Gyeongbokghng Palace which is at walking distance from Gyeongbokghng metro station.  The palace is huge is size and you have to walk a lot to cover all the parts of palace.  The Korean architecture is full of colours & they use lot of wood for making building.  The live music show during the visit was treat for the eyes ( girls playing drums).  Also many local people were dressed in Korean colourful traditional dresses, everyone looking great.  A not to miss place .."
1209,4.0,"This palace is located in the middle of town, surrounded by Seoul city, very interesting. I got here with a tour guide but I did not pay attention to the explanation, just taking some pictures which are beautiful. Well, a historical side in the city, very clean, and beautiful sceneries. But, you have to be ready to take a long walk."
1210,4.0,"Haven't been to many palaces in my lifetime, but walking through this one certainly made for a nice, informative afternoon! Loads of people in Hanbok (admission is free is you are wearing one?) enjoying themselves. The buildings themselves are georgous inside and out. Heartbreakingly poignant were the residences for Empress Myeongseong. With the mountains looming on the one side and skyscrapers on the other, an overall interesting exploration of Korea's past. Maybe try to visit on off-peak hours, it got quite busy and crowded on our way out."
1211,5.0,"We took the Airport Express Train from Incheon to Seoul in 50 minutes. Purchased the Express Ticket at the airport, easily followed the orange signs, assigned seats, off in Seoul. Short subway and a short walk and were at the Palace at 10 am in time for changing of the guards ceremony. Not to be missed. Very colorful and ornate. The Palace is huge. A court yard within a court yard within a court yard. Beautiful. Make sure to find the gardens. Gives you an idea of the landscaping of the past. Serene."
1212,5.0,"This is a great place to learn the Joseon dynasty period of Korea. It is fascinating to see a huge palace complex in the middle of a city. The highlight of this place is the changing of guards ceremony, as if traveling back in time."
1213,5.0,Interesting part of history. Changing of the guards was worth a look. The gardens are lovely for a stroll.
1214,4.0,"Maybe because I've been to the forbidden city in Beijing. This palace seemed a little plain, but is a great location for Korean-themed photoshooting.  There's is an entrance fee of 3,000 Korean wons btw."
1215,5.0,"An absolute must. I was here for the afternoon and wish that I had allowed a full day. Acres and acres of space and lots to explore. The photographic opportunities are in abundance here. It was extremely busy and a hot sunny day with blossom everywhere. Many, many couples taking photographs in traditional dress which is so stunning. Even though it was busy, you can still lose yourself in the grounds and find some quiet spots to sit with a picnic lunch if you wish. The admission for myself was only 3000 won which is super super cheap and makes English Heritage Admission prices absolutely ludicrous. I came away having had a super day with stacks of wonderful memories and photographs."
1216,5.0,"I would like to recommend this place to foreigners who visit to Korea. You can learn Korea history and tradition! Also, can feel Korean life style. You can get to there by subway No.3 (Orange line)."
1217,5.0,"Korea Grand Palace ""Kyoung Bok Gung"" Great place to learn Korea history and tradition. You can get there by subway No.3 (Orange line). I've been to Old Palace in other countries, because, can know their history and tradition. Also, this place is same. Really different architecture and life style. I would like to recommend this place to foreigners who visit to Korea."
1218,5.0,If you're visiting Seoul this is a must see! We loved this Palace and we're in awe of its beauty. My mother in law had a broken toe so this was a hard day for her but we did get her a wheelchair. A lot of Walking and uneven ground with some stairs made for a painful day for her but she made it! Stay for the changing of the guard ceremony if possible.
1219,5.0,Absolutely a beautiful palace that reflects traditional local culture and history. You may want to visit at the time that free English speaking your guide provided near the entrance- you can get detailed info visitor centers- to get most of the palace.

1222,5.0,"I appreciate Korean Palaces so much because it shows how much they treasure their history. It was well preserved and strictly kept clean, and thus it has become a highly respected place. I wish the Philippines valued its history as much as Koreans did. :("
1223,3.0,Go there for a good morning walk.Nothing much to see. Very empty palace. Lucky the entrance fee is not expensive.
1224,4.0,"It's a very busy place during weekends, but I do consider it to be worth it. You have to pay a small fee for the entrance but can stay as long as you'd like to. You're able to rent some historical and traditional Korean clothes for enhance the experience."
1225,5.0,We visited this palace on a beautiful sunny day and it was great to see the change of guard ceremony. Try to schedule your visit during the change of guard ceremony which happens several times during the day. The staff even lets you wear the traditional outfit for free of cost and it's a great photo opportunity. Overall a great vibe and a must do when you are in Seoul. You will spot a lot of couples wearing traditional hanbok.
1226,5.0,"This palace has been preserved quite beautifully. Admission is a mere $4USD and quite worth it. We happened to be lucky enough to catch all the cherry blossoms and flowers blooming. Many people choose to rent the traditional Hanboks prior to entering, as it's quite inexpensive and makes a beautiful photograph."
1227,3.0,Free entry if you are wearing hanbok. The palace closed every Tuesday. It's a good place to take photo.
1228,5.0,What a great place to visit and see! Totally loved our tour of this site. A lot of cool history and a lot to see!
1229,4.0,"Beautiful palace surrounded by various blooms of the spring. Nice place for a stroll and learn about Korea's culture and history. Exit at Gwanghwamun station Exit 9 and you can see King Sejong and Jung Yu-shin general statue at the Gwanghwamun Square on the way to the palace. If you are interested to know about their history, do drop by the King Sejong and Jung Yu-shin general Museum located just behind King Sejongas statue. There is a secret stairway leading down to the museum right behind the statue."
1230,5.0,"It's an imense palace, surrounded by a peaceful neighborhood. You can walk around the palaces and trees, and enjoy the tranquility of the place. It's included a ticket to the Folklore Museum, an atraction that should not be missed."
1231,5.0,"Originally built in 14 century but later restored in 19 century because of fire, Gyeongbokgung Palace is the largest remaining palace in Seoul from the old Joseon Dynasty. It houses many old palace buildings that are still standing today, some are national treasures. However, Hyangwonjeong Pond is closed to visitors for unknown reason. The National Palace Museum of Korea is located south of Heungnyemun Gate but is currently being renovated, and the National Folk Museum is located on the eastern side which is highly recommended.  The best entrance is through Gwanghwamun gate. There are performances of guards changing ceremony taking place every day. Please find out their timing before you go. Please remember the palace is closed to visitors every Tuesday. Do not be caught unaware."
1232,5.0,Gyeongbokgung Palace is a wonderful place to visit and a must when in Seoul. Truly magnificent. The view is spectacular and one should try to put on the traditional garb and enjoy relieving Korea's glorious past.
1233,5.0,"When the KDramas were in bloom in 2000's, I was dreaming Korea as my home. I never expected that it became a reality. I love all the places especially where these historical destinations. I was really amazed when I got in the gate, there are 4 palaces to visit. This was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty. Best visited during Cherry Blossom seasons (in my opinion)."
1234,4.0,"As you can see from the title, yes, free entrance is possible if you rent a hanbok (Korean traditional clothes). There's shops near Gyeongbokgong that rent out the hanboks. You can do some research first before going. And if you're like me, you've been there and just want to walk around taking pictures as well as seeing the shift changing of the gate guards, arrive there around 1:00pm or 1:20pm. If not mistaken, the ceremony starts at 1:30pm. For me, I've been there like 4 times and I've already know how the palace looks like, so I just walk around Gwanghwamun without paying a cent to enter the palace. Besides, there's a museum near the subway exit near Gyeongbokgong which is FREE OF CHARGE."
1235,5.0,One of the tourists spot that you must not missed. A lot of foreigners wearing Korean costumes and have pictorial in the place. It's a vast place to walk so wear a comfortable shoes.

Search online for where to rent a hanbok.  2. Get a map.  Plan your route, evade the huge crowd of tourists and still cover all the spots of the palace. Maps are available before entering the gates.  3. Wear comfortable shoes.  You won’t want to be limping through your time travel or be distracted by a painful blister."
1238,5.0,My mom is not a fan of museums and she was totally blown away by the structures and the interesting backstory. It is beautiful there and if you arrive in time you can join one of the free multi lingual tours! Highly recommend it.
1239,5.0,"We went to this beautiful landmark early in the morning to avoid the crowd. We only have a little time left in Seoul so we did our tour inside quickly. Many tourist in groups often stop near the entrance taking pics etc blocking your way lol so to skip this, keep on walking inside as the palace is huge. Not much description written on each room in the palace, or maybe we just had to take the guide book or something at the entrance. We did the whole palace in 1 hour by keep on walking and taking pics quickly."
1240,5.0,"Originally built in 1395, this complex was the seat of the Joseon Dynasty until destroyed by the Japanese in the 1590’s. Instead of rebuilding, the royal family moved to another palace site. In 1867-68, the Prince Regent sponsored a reconstruction. Unfortunately, it again was almost totally destroyed during the second Japanese occupation prior to World War II, and the events of the Korean War. Restoration work began again in 1989, but according to our guide, only about 50% of the buildings have been completed. Nonetheless it is a fascinating place to visit and easily accessible. Inevitably, one will compare it to The Forbidden City because of similar design, but on a smaller scale. Make sure that you see Gyeonghoeru Pavilion (on the lake), one of the structures that dates from the 1867 restoration. It was used for entertainment when important foreign visitors visited the palace. Another point of interest is the video that deals with the assassination of Empress Myeongseong by Japanese agents in 1895 (and her quarters). One thing that added charm to our visit was the large number of young folks wearing traditional dress. Evidently, the clothes are available for rental and this has become a “thing to do” on a date, or just a lark."
1241,4.0,"There's a metro station just beside the palace so it's very easy to go to. On the front gate, you may take your pictures with the royal palace guards. And every hour, there's a performance where the guards change their duty shift. Apparently, there's a little ceremony for that!  Once the performance is done (roughly after ten minutes), the application for the use of guards costume opens. But you have to very quick because they only accommodate max of 10 pax per time slot. We were just lucky enough to be included!!! You may choose from the 4 costumes you want to try. Once you're on it, you can only wander along the ground but not too far! So it's just good for taking pictures. :)  Entrance to the palace is 3000 won for adults. Palace ground is huge and very picturesque so it's worth your while to roam around. :)"
1242,5.0,"The palace was very designed and harmonised with the beauty of the surrounding nature. You could appreciate the creativity of the designers of the palace. At the end of the tour, I was most touched by the sad story of the Queen who was assassinated by the Japanese soldiers. Visitors are allowed to watch a video of the story, visit her rooms and imagine the atrocities happened in the past. Highly recommended."
1243,4.0,"Lovely place to visit. Shame the original palace was destroyed. But great that koreans are rebuilding it (as best as possible) to preserve their history. I guess in the summer it's even more beautiful. We we lucky that a high school student, Mary, offered to guide us. We got lots of information about Korean traditions, old customs and history.. And lots of information about the palaces history.  We spend several hours there before heading to the Folk Museum in the area."
1244,4.0,"The Admission: 3,000 won.  The Palace: One of the biggest palace in Seoul. Beautiful architecture!! This palace was the first royal palace built in the Joseon Dynasty.  Sumunjang changing of the guard ceremony(twice a day) 10am & 2pm.  Gwanghwamum changing of the guard ceremony (twice a day) 11am & 1pm.  They also offer English, Japanes and Chinese guided tour.  The Location: Subway Line 3, Gyeongbokgung Station, Exit 5"
1245,4.0,"The place is beautiful, the mountains on one side and the modern buildings on the other makes this a unique sight! Combine a tour at the palace and it's surrounding buildings with a visit to the National Museum of Korean Contemporary History, just across the street."
1246,3.0,"Nice palace. Well maintained attraction. Very inexpensive to get in. The grounds are large, so on a nice day, this is a very nice walk. Would've been nice to see on of the buildings furnished as it would've looked during the period. So after looking at many buildings, we got kinda bored."
1247,5.0,i arrived around 10 am and at the same time with changing guard ceremony in the place. The view of nature was very beautiful with the snow was falling that day.
1248,4.0,"bring food 🥘 and hot drinks, other than that we like this historic place, to get free entrance wear a hanbuk, confirm free, rent it or buy it just outside the palace"
1249,5.0,"Gyeongbok Palace is the largest in Seoul, completed in1395. King Taejo also built Changdeok Palace completed in 1405. Yi Seonggye an army general that overthrew the government and took the name King Taejo. Yi started the Joseoy Dynasty which ruled from 1392 to 1910. ending with the defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War. He moved the Capital from Gaegyeong to Hanyang (later became Seoul). Gyeongbok Palace is not only beautiful, its history where all the social attitudes formed, powerful etiquette, and the cultural norms.."
1250,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is the biggest palace in Seoul. It shows a very important part of Korean history, reflecting how people used to live. The gardens are pretty large, with many buildings in the area. As the palace is in a very historical area, there are many ""hanbok"" renters around, and tourists may dress in Hanbok for authentic experience. As for me, watching people around in Hanbok was very interesting. A not-to-miss is ""the change of guards ceremony"" - takes place at 10:00 and 14:00. This is a reenactment of the original ceremony from 1400's, takes about 20 minutes and they announce the actions in Korean and English. Also, you can dress-up as guards for authentic photos. The Gyeonghoeru Pavilion on Hyangwonjeong Pond the biggest pavillon in Korea, and it is a beautiful view with the mountains at the back. Strolling in the gardens of this palace and viewing the mountains, trees and ponds, I felt like in a movie from the old times."
1251,4.0,"It's easy to access there. 1. Line no 3 - orange line - get off Kyong Bok Palace. gate no 5 to the palace. it consist of several palace building. the most beautiful and greatest palace. 2. you can also walk to there from Kwang Hua Moon or City hall. 3. in the palace, there is a museum. it's quite good place to go. 4. on it's right side, there is Sam Chung Dong. now it becomes a famous place Korean Traditional style houses(Han Oak) village. it's good place of walking."
1252,5.0,"Out of all the places I visited on my 6-day trip to Seoul, this is my favorite. Went there during winter and it was amazing. Wasn't able to cover the whole palace during my 2-hour visit. Would visit again if I come back to Seoul."
1253,4.0,Love the architecture and the fact that they make sure that the palace grounds are kept clean and restored! Popular place to see a glimpse of history.
1254,3.0,A good place to know about Korea Palace and the history by joining the tour provided by the palace. Do visit the muzium nearby. Should try their hanbok dress cheapest is ₩13k rent for 2hrs and free entrance to the palace. Lovely experienced.
1255,5.0,This palace i believe is the more popular one among the 5 nearby. It is huge and due to the hectic schedule we are unable to explore the place. Probably need like half a day to properly explore the area. There is a museum inside.
1256,5.0,"Be sure to join Gyeongbokgung Palace's free guided tour to better appreciate the place. It will only take one hour for you to learn more about Korea's rich history. If you plan to go to Bukchon Hanok Village, better ask information which gate you should exit. You might also want to check out the Blue House while you're in the Palace. They have an exit that will allow you to see the front of the Blue House. We weren't able to see the Changing of the Guards, but you might want to fix your schedule so you can see it."
1257,5.0,The palace is extremely picturesque. I took some amazing shots here in the Autumn. The old architecture combines beautifully with fall colors. I think it's a fantastic place to go if you're looking for amazing photographs.
1258,4.0,"This is my second visit and i really enjoyed being a princess in one day, where you can rent a hanbook (tradisional uniform) across the road.  Rented fees is 30,000 won for 2 hours and we entered the palace with free of charge because im wearing it.  Beside that, u can try the men traditional cloth for free at main gate.  If this is your first time, you can join with others tourist as they provide English tour guide.  I went there by subway,"
1259,5.0,"A must go place! You may find it is a good to place to go in different seasons, go with a big group or good to go alone! A place where you can sit to enjoy the scenery, take pictures and to find out more the Korean Royal life. Go connection with Metro!"
1260,5.0,"Don't miss this if you are visiting Seoul. The guard changing ceremonies are the highlight and performing daily in short and long sessions. Do at least stay for the short one if your schedule allowed. There are also free guided tours available in different languages. Head to the right from the main gate for the information center once you purchase the entrance ticket. The staff was very helpful!  The palace was indeed amazing in winter. Many girls - tourists and locals alike dressed up in hanbok. It was such a beautiful scene. I've been to Seoul countless times but this was the first to the palace. I would totally come back again the next time to learn more about its history, and hopefully the weather won't be too cold so I can dress up in hanbok to take a stroll in the palace."
1261,5.0,"We spent an hour to get to 'Jongro-3road' station, because we wanted to go to ""Gyeongbokgung"". Before we go inside of it, we could see a large door called ""Gwanghwamun"". We could see quite a lot of people wearing ""Hanbok"" when we get through the gate. The palace was absolutely astonishing. We couldn't see the end because it's vast compound. Also when we looked inside of the Hanok(Korean traditional house), we could see beautiful colored ceiling. We could feel that this palace is the history of the place. It was almost hard to take in. We felt overwhelming. Also there is a wonderful lake. This lake was surrounded by large trees. In the middle of the lake there is a small island. We were honestly, completely blown away by this. Because we saw this place, we become aware of the sheer wealth and power of the Joseon dynasty. Absolutely incredible place. I highly recommend to visit here. Visiting this place is just the same with seeing a little piece of a picture in the past. Tip : It spends more than 3 hours to look this palace. Also even if you are foreigner, you can go inside the palace for free if you wear a Korean traditional clothes. You can rent it $20. You can get a great picture with it."
1262,5.0,We went here during winter but it was still busy! We bought tickets on arrival then decided to hire some Hanbok (traditional Korean dresses) which were all located outside the palace on the main roads. We didn't know that if you are wearing traditional clothes you get to enter the palace for free! The ticket lady at the door told us to go get a refund for our tickets. It was simply amazing! All the intricate little details of the design was mesmerizing! Definitely a must see!
1263,4.0,"I love palaces and castles. I enjoy history so I like such palaces. But my brother thinks they are all the same and boring. So, to each his own. This is the biggest palace, so it's a must-see. But it's a nice place for photos, get a feel of Korean culture. Fun to see many people walking around in Korean hanbok clothes too. Feel like they came from another age into the modern world. There's guided tours provided in various languages. Be sure to check which one you want to join from the website timing before you go, so you can plan your day better. Wait at the front of the information office for the tour. I would suggest going for the tour so you can get more structured information about the palace. The national folk museum and palace museum are on the same grounds. Both are free but the palace is not. If you enjoy palaces, buy the combination ticket as its 4 palaces + 1 shrine (total ₩14000) but with the combi ticket it costs only ₩10000. Value for money if you will visit most of it. Good to spend a day wondering around the palace and museums. Recommended!"
1264,3.0,"It's not the best palace which I've bee and it's nothing compared to some other palaces. Yet, it's definitely worth a visit. Also great to take pictures with other visitors who dressed up as the emperors and empresses!"
1265,5.0,"The first attraction we visited upon arrival to Seoul. It was winter so it was not crowded at all (though, I've never been there during the other seasons) so you can take time in taking photos and just walk. Just as the other tourist attractions in South Korea, the palace is well maintained, toilets and surroundings are clean, tourist information areas are present, and English tourist maps and guides are provided.  Admission fee is KRW3000 but you can get a discount if you're visiting in group of at least 10. Good thing is, if you have enough time, there is an integrated ticket which you can purchase for KRW10,000 and entitles you to visit the other major palaces and temples in Seoul.  The best thing about the attractions in Seoul is the location. The attractions are pretty much close to each other, hence they are easy to find, especially if your using the subway. The National Folk Museum is located just next to Gyeongbokgung, and you can visit the place for free. You can visit other nearby Museums after, head to Bukchon Hanok Village and stroll at Insadong and Samcheongdong afterwards. Then you can take pictures at the Gwanghwamun gate as you head off to the subway on your way home (what we did, since we entered the Gwanghwamun Subway Station as we got back home).  **If you don't mind long walks, it's better to walk from one attraction to next. **Just make sure to wear your winter clothes to keep you warm as it gets really cold especially when it's windy. Bet you don't wanna spoil your tour when you're busy keeping yourself warm. :)  If you plan to visit Changdeokgung, I suggest you alot another day for that to appreciate, then you can go to Jongmyo Shrine after. You can also exchange Changdeokgung and Gyeongbokgung. Both are near Bukchon Hanok and Insadong-Samcheongdong"
1266,4.0,"Went there about 4 times in summer, winter and spring. winter visit isn't giving the palace any charm as it is cold and not colorful. When spring arrive, the palace take it's color and is much more welcoming"
1267,4.0,"Did a solo trip to the palace, which is conveniently located near a subway station.  There is a change of traditional palace guard parade that had explanations in English, Mandarin and Japanese; very interesting to watch and understand.  The palace itself is quite a big compound and well preserved and restored. I would have preferred that there were more directional signages and explanations of the various locations of the palace. I did not see any maps for visitors to take along (maybe I missed it), hence, some places that I walked had nothing much to view. The lack of explanation boards at the various locations made my visit a purely sightseeing trip, so for those who want some history, either get a guide book or a guided tour."
1268,4.0,"visited some palace around seoul, me personally is not a fan of history but went there to accompany my family. I bring them to some other palace and it look a like, I suggested to come to one of them is enough."
1269,4.0,The surrounding area of the palace is quite vast so you could just walk around anywhere and imagine what it was like for the past kings and queens. Entrance is ₩8000 but there's an integrated ticket (₩10000) if you want to get to all palaces. Check this place out and explore it! Witness the guard changing at 10AM and 2PM. Try the guard costumes for free (first come first serve basis!).
1270,4.0,A few of my korean friends went to Gyeongbokgung to show a few friends from overseas. None of us had been there but we just walked around by ourselves casually. It's mostly all seen from the outside so was a bit cold in winter but still a good stroll on a fine day. Allow around 2 hours to have a wander and appreciate the architecture and korean culture here (we didn't go to the museum). One end faces the president's blue house and the other end faces gwanghwamoon. There will be people walking around in the korean traditional attire as there are places to hire them around the palace and the entrance to the palace is free if you come dressed so. But the entrance fee is cheap anyway
1271,4.0,"There are free tours of the palace grounds at certain times of the day (in English, Mandarin, and other languages). Make sure you join one of these - it will say in the information pamphlet what time and where the guide will be waiting. We found the experience to be much more enriching with the tour."
1272,5.0,"This is a very typical Korean Traditional palace which is built in ancient Korea, and it is very impressive how well it is preserved. A perfect spot to experience Korean style architecture, a must go place if this is your first time to come to Korea."
1273,5.0,"Plan your visit to see the ""Change of Guards"" but even if you can't be there during the event you will not be disappointed. I spent about 3 hours exploring all that I could but one can be there for a whole day as there are so many rooms and details! A Must see!"
1274,4.0,"The palace itself is absolutely stunning even if it was a bit small. The changing of the guards is a must, as there is a little audio thing that plays during it to explain things. Overall a very interesting and lovely trip."
1275,3.0,"Once you've seen 1 palace, you've seen it all (in my opinion). The only difference here is that you get to watch the changing of the guards. Good thing it was winter time when I visited. The weather, though cold was bearable. I can't imagine walking around this place during summer. I might literally melt :)"
1276,4.0,"Highly recommended to join the free tour at the palace, you may check the timings of the tour on their website. There is no need to sign up for the tour in advance, you can just turn up near the main gate of the palace. The tour guide will explain to you the various living quarters of the palace.  I waited for the changing guards ceremony at 3pm but it did not happen, not sure if there was a change in their schedule?  There are many people wearing hanbok in the palace. I've checked with the information centre that they do not provide renting of hanbok. You will have to rent it at one of the shops outside the palace.  The palace is huge and requires a lot of walking. Hence, it is recommended to wear good walking shoes."
1277,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace has to be one of the most budget friendly tourist attractions I've ever been to - at 3000krw it is a bargain.  One piece of advice I have is to arrive about 15 mins to the hour - this way it will give you enough time to buy tickets and watch the guards changing (happens on the hour) which will then give you ample time to roam the very spacious palatial grounds. This way you don't have to rush to the entrance if you are somewhere else in the compound to watch the change of guards.  I very much enjoyed the palace - we went in the morning and would recommend you do this to avoid the crowds as this is a tourist hot spot. This way you can get lots of photos without people in the way. Having said that the Gyeongbokgung Palace is HUGE - we just avoided the crowds by walking around the outside first where you can admire all the foyer and ceiling art followed by walks next to the water gardens which are a lovely place to admire the wildlife among the water lilies.  If you can allocate at least two hours to walk around the grounds - it's very scenic and clean - if I lived in Seoul I would come here for the peace and quiet alone, not to mention it is a great workout if you visit every part of the compound.  A must-see and notable attraction if you have time on your trip - it's easily accessible by Subway and not far from other hot spots in the city."
1278,5.0,"Spend half a day at this lovely palace. So many things to explore, great park and scenic and tranquil. Don't miss it."
1279,4.0,"This was the first palace I visited, and was the one I enjoyed the most. It was beautiful. My recommendation is that you book a tour as it is more interesting to see the place and know the history. I would think it will be quite boring just to visit and take picture. You can book the free tour provided by VisitKorea, if you are in tight budget."
1280,3.0,Not a must visit tourist attraction. It was just a normal palace with a lot of tourists. Not as grand as I hope for. The guard changing was interesting. Seeing them wearing their traditional costume. You can get free trial of the costume. Just go straight to a small hut behind the main gate after the guard changing ceremony.
1281,4.0,A wonderful palace with lots of historical perspective. Great to walk the grounds for an hour or so to better understand how royalty lived during Korea's Chosun Dynasty.
1282,5.0,Took the City Tour bus and alighted at this palace. Nice place for photo taking and impressive buildings in thia palace. Like it alot
1283,5.0,The compound of the palace is very big so be prepared to do a lot of walking. Do not miss the changing of the guards ceremony.
1284,5.0,"A great place to learn on Korean culture and early imperial history. Very easy to go- take direct train to Gyeongbokgung palace and follow signage. Entry is 3000 won I think and you can rent an audio guide for 3000 won at the counter next to ticket office. 4 language choices- japanese, mandarin, english and Korean  We rented hanbok (Korean traditional costume) at a shop near by for 18000 won per set (males hat for additional 1000 won) and it allows free entry to the palace. The package is 4 hours for picture taking. The shop we went to is not the one opposite the ticketing office. In my opinion, the one opposite ticketing office doesn't really have costume."
1285,4.0,"Love the overall look and feel of the palace grounds. The buildings and parks inside truly provides for an immersive experience. You must make it for the changing of the guard, which is conducted daily. I feel as if that made the visit more special. The park inside the palace compound was gorgeous. I visited in Autumn, so the falling leaves/cool breeze may have played a role. I totally recommend visiting"
1286,5.0,"If you have a limited time, this is the biggest palace to go. Palace design is influenced by Ming and Qing dynasties. The palace ground is still being reconstructed as a lot of the buildings were destroyed or damaged during the two Japanese invasions. According to locals, the palace is about one third completed and is slated to be fully reconstructed by 2020 or 2030.  Best photo spots are during spring and autumn. In winter, no leaves. You must go for the Change of Guard Ceremony at 10 am and 2 pm."
1287,4.0,"I visited the palace both during the day and also for the night tours, the night tour was definitely my favourite. The pavilion was lit up and there were performances.They only do night tours during the autumn months."
1288,4.0,"If you have only short stay and want to see Korean palaces, this is it: located in central Seoul and you will be able to see beauty of Korean palace with beautiful landscapes surrounding the palace! Sometimes they open during the night hopefully this Christmas. Inside, Korean folks museum is another place to learn about Korean culture and custom. Winter time you need a heavy coat since most walking is outside to appreciate the palace!"
1289,4.0,"It was in 1395, 3years after the Joseon Gyeongbokgung palace was at the heart of seoul and front of Gwanghwamun Gate  Free Guided Tour 11:00 / 13:30 / 15:30  한 여름밤의 야간개장 경복궁 운치있고 아름다워요 마지막주 수요일 문화가 있는 날은 무료관람가능 혹은 한복입어도 무료관람~ 고궁 :)"
1290,5.0,This huge place was the bomb. When we arrived there was a guard changing ceremony in front and it was totally cool. Tickets are only KRW3000. The architecture was just so beautiful. One of the lake was frozen when we arrived but we can still see fishes inside. Simply beautiful.
1291,4.0,"We spend time in Seoul for 4 nights , first day we visited here with my family and my friend We purchased the tickets and walk around to the palace. It's like in the Korean series that I like very much. Felt like being shown on the series lol. Palace pretty much a source of this country. And I can even walk to the back of the palace as well.I really fall in love this county . The people are very help full"
1292,4.0,An area much larger than you imagine on walking towards it. In winter closes at 4pm. Lots of buildings and a pond to look at as you walk about. Some steps but it is an easy relaxing walk and central to the city so you can walk on Metro there easily. A popular attraction in the peak season so look at getting in early in the high season.
1293,5.0,"We enjoyed walking around the palace grounds and watching the changing of the guards. What we initially thought was a canon being shot off nearby was actually a massive drum being struck as part of the guard changing performance. Was also only 3,000 won to enter so very cheap. Highly recommended"
1294,4.0,"One of 5 palaces, biggest and most popular one. Guard changing ceremony a little theatrical but makes for nice pictures"
1295,5.0,This palace even though it's mostly been recreated due to destruction it's been completed Ina truly gorgeous manner. You can wander around the whole complex using just the provided map. There is lots of signage in English explaining what the various buildings originally used for. Talk a lunch and sit in the open spaces for a relaxing experience
1296,5.0,"Good tourist attractions... a huge amd spacious palace,before you enter the palace you need to watch the exhibition of the guards first at the main gate then you can now go inside and explore a lot of things.."
1297,5.0,"You're dazzled the moment you step into the main gates from the street. Locals dressed in the local dress add a priceless touch to the place. The blend of the old architecture with the modern cityscape in the background is something not to miss. It is quite a long walk to the palace itself, but well worth it. A lot of greenery and running waters add a peaceful touch to the place. Be ready to get a lot of photos and don't worry about the food or drink as there are small stalls with snacks and drinks spread throughout the place.  Usually, musical shows and concerts are held there at around 7 pm with separate tickets but the settings are usually bewildering. If you get the chance to go, don't think twice."
1298,4.0,A must visit for first time to Seoul. It's a place of history and reflection of the Imperial culture. Nice maintained buildings and garden.
1299,4.0,Love the peace and tranquility this palace offers. The vastness provided me enough space to just chill at a quiet corner and rest my mind without the crowd buzzing around.  The autumn Colours at some parts of the palace and garden areas were amazing and I have managed to captured some great moments.  Do spend some time at this palace when you are in Seoul. The shopping can wait.
1300,4.0,"Although there is no like the majestic palace of Beijing the imperial palace, also have no gorgeous color. But to South Korea will go to scenic spots, is one of the historical features of Seoul, the former imperial palace, a historic place, listening to the history to follow, will definitely have to deepen the understanding, and there are a lot of tourist information provided to the tourists from country to country. This is a great building, regardless of appearance or palace to a person very elegant feeling, with very distinctive features of the south Korean historical buildings. Maintenance, both inside and outside place clean and tidy. And has a performance, or there will be a change in noon soldier performance (martial arts), there are large in army demonstration, cooperate with diet language between China and Japan, to take care of the needs of different nationality. Garden scenery good, in a quiet place, worth a visit."
1301,5.0,"I went during Chuseok, which I recommend to everyone because of the broad array of events which were planned for the holiday. Gyeongbokgung Palace is just beautiful and a nice sunny day made the whole experience that much better."
1302,5.0,its realy big The complex really big. Worth a walk all of it. There is a lovely lake There are also guides in English Two hours trip
1303,4.0,Away from the busy street and embraced the ample space and astonishing ancient architecture. I would recommend my family and friends to visit when they visit Seoul.
1304,5.0,We enjoyed watching the changing of the guards and our tour of the palace was really good. The architecture and colors of the buildings were amazing.
1305,4.0,Gorgeous... wear the traditional hanbok costumes here and relive your korean dramas! Hahahaha! Beautiful..
1306,3.0,"We were disappointed with the Gyeongbokgung Palace. So many guide books put it as one of the top ten sites to visit in Seoul. The palace is not very well maintained, many rooms have no exhibits or furniture there. The only scenic spot is near the small ornamental lake."
1307,5.0,"It was a Saturday when we visited and the palace was a bit crowded. Many locals in their traditional hanbok allow tourists to pose with them for pictures. The palace ground is huge with several structures on it. It costs $3 to enter the main palace but free for seniors if you show your passport. Be prepared to do a lot of walking, but definitely a must see. The changing of the guards is an added attraction."
1308,5.0,"I did not visit the other palaces around Seoul but this is definitely worth a visit. The palace grounds are quite large and it would take at least 2 hours to cover the entire area. We had a surprise visit from the 'Emperor' himself, as he walked through the grounds with his ""Emperess' and 'guards'! Lots of local Koreans in their traditional costumes."
1309,5.0,The place with many surprises.. It a very big place and I was there for 3hours .Make sure you go with a tour or hire the audio guide at the entrance which is very helpful.
1310,5.0,"This is a must-see in Seoul. A huge place, very interesting buildings and lovely gardens. Great for people-watching too, especially on Sundays when lots of locals wear traditional Korean dress."
1311,5.0,"We booked a complimentary tour through Visit Korea's website and met at the ticket office at 10am on the day of visit. Our guide was a lovely lady who was a volunteer. It's impressive that locals would volunteer their time and energy to introduce their city to foreigners. She was very enthusiastic and spoke decent English. We started at the main entrance and walked our way through the whole palace. Extremely beautiful place with lots of history and unique architecture. Our wonderful guide explained the architectural aspects, history of the structures, and even some present day local affairs! We wouldn't have been able to understand so much without her. Time well spent and a must-visit in Seoul!"
1312,5.0,"Entering this palace is like we walk in the history.  Trying to imagine what the live in the year of 1300 looks like.  It's definitely a grand palace, huge complex with lot of green sceneery inside.  Love the roof architecture.  I personally like Hyangwon-Jeong pavilion, a royal residence of Emperor Gojong. Surrounded by lotus pond, makes this place so beautiful and serene.  Direction to this attraction : stop at Gyeongbokgung Palace Station (Seoul Subway Line 3), Exit 5.  Instagram : @adjimantoro"
1313,3.0,"I have been to Gyeongdong Palace a number of times.I also am from the US. This time I brought a visitor from the U.S.. We are both cabinet makers, so in visualizing the construction of the palace and other buildings on the grounds, we were impressed. That's not to say that there isn't an air of falsity about the restoration/renovations/reconstruction of the compound. The buildings are not that old. The grounds are not maintained as if they were still a living quarters. One is left wandering about without having a true grasp of the daily life of the palace grounds. There needs to be more visual and written placards  What is important is with an imagination a person can picture how people moved about and how the city was laid.  There is room for improvement. Drop your iPods, cell phone and other tech devices. Imagine 100 years ago. 200 years ago."
1314,4.0,"The palace is very easy to get to by Metro and the exit takes you right to the main courtyard of the palace. It gets quite busy although doesn't feel too crowded as the grounds are quite big. It seemed that a relatively popular activity was to dress up in local traditional attire which was available for rental. I didn't go for that personally but there were many families, school groups and also couples that did so and this somewhat added to the atmosphere of the palace.  A striking contrast was the backdrop to the palace grounds where on one side you had the mountains and on the other side you had the tall modern buildings of the city. Aside from the main preserved buildings the gardens themselves provide nice photo opportunities particularly around the pond areas. There are also replica buildings that have been constructed that you can wander in to.  The palace also has changing of the guards which I unfortunately missed so worthwhile checking the times and getting there to catch the ceremony.  Note that the vast majority of the visit is outdoors and walking around the grounds so do be prepared."
1315,5.0,"You can go there by train or bus and just a few walk to the palace. Entrance fee is 3,000 KRW and you should visit there since morning because it's very large. For women who would like to wear Hanbok (traditional dress), you can rent from shop near the palace before and go inside. If you buy ticket and go inside, it cannot re-entry to rent the dress later."
1316,3.0,"The Temple was very large but had nothing to do. It was however really pretty and there was a nice museum. The small giftshop was awfully expensive. The museum had a large variety of items but the signs with descriptiones were only simply and shortly translated into english, so I'd suggest that you get an audio guide."
1317,5.0,"It's a good day's fun, there are small streets with lots of small shops and places you can rent Hanbok (the traditional clothing) immediately to the East of the palace. We rented Hanbok and entered the palace as the admission is free if you're wearing Hanbok. It is also a trend among young people and couples nowadays to do it and take pictures while touring the palace, kinda like cosplaying in a way I guess? It was interesting seeing the changing of the guard, different architectures and other people walking around with Hanbok too."
1318,5.0,"Our visit was so interesting, no doubt because of an excellent English-speaking guide. She gave a good overview of Confucian traditions and the Joseun Dynasty. The grounds are quite lovely, plus there are two museums on the premises that are worth seeing."
1319,5.0,My second time to visit the palace and it's still amazing.  The changing of the guards is a must see. Try to schedule a visit during one.
1320,4.0,Very economical experience! The entry fee was very reasonable. Think it worked out to be about US$3. The grounds provide free tours in 3 languages at different times of the day. We took the English speaking one at 1:30 pm. A rich piece of Korean history and a lovely way to spend a couple of hours. Note the palace is closed on Tuesdays.
1321,5.0,"We visited this palace, the largest of the 5 palaces within Seoul, in the morning and it was already teeming with tourists. There is so much history to absorb both in visual and audible form. The details on the decor, roof structure & building design are awe inspiring. Each detail, whether it be the shape of the roof, the colour combination of the ceiling beams, the setting of rooms (with heating options), is so meaningful. Like the other palaces, this is meticulously restored. You can almost feel the presence of royals and the troops within the palace. The place however seems squeezed by the sprawling metropolis though once within its perimeter, one can enjoy the peaceful and serene atmosphere. One thing notable is that unlike Changdeokgung Palace, which is of Korean architecture (entrance walkway is crooked), this palace is of Chinese design (entrance walkway is straight)."
1322,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung is also one of the places to visit in Seoul. Not only is it beautiful to see, it is also easy to find and free of entrance! If you exit from City Hall (blue line) subway exit 2, walk down the road up until the end. It is aproximately a 15minute walk. On the way there you will find the statue of King Sejong (3rd king and supporter of Hangul) and Yi Sun-Sin (famous naval commander). You can also take the purple line to Gwanghwamun which is closer but does not go from Seoul station."
1323,4.0,"I like this place. Walking around, exploring. Take a rest when feeling tired. Entrance ticket is KRW 3K, free if you wear hanbok. They also have free guided tour on certain time. Be sure to check out their website."
1324,5.0,A place where it tells you the history of the Korean Dynasty and how the palace was burn down. Do join the free guided tour to fully appreciate the palace. Do not walk on your own. They in the process of rebuilding the entire palace which is schedule to complete in 2045. Beautiful place to walk around and with many Korean in Hanbok. It's worth coming.
1325,4.0,"The Palace is nice but your visit gets better when you see the gardens. I was so lucky I went during Fall/autumn, so I could see the different colour of the trees."
1326,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is a must-visit when you are in Seoul! Do note that the palace is closed on Tuesdays so avoid going on that day. It is extremely accessible via the metro (alight at Gyeongbokgung Palace station itself, Line 3, Exit 5). You can even walk to Bukchon Hanok Village from there. If you're in Hanbok, admission to the palace is FREE!"
1327,4.0,"The palace itself is not so much to see. On a sunny weekend, you can find citizens/tourists wearing Hanbok in it, as if it is a movie studio. It's great to get some Korean vibe. Also, do visit the palace at night! The palace is glowing with some lights on. There are some beautiful pine trees besides the park."
1328,3.0,"The palace is open for public visits. And as with most of the palace worldwide, there is guard changing ceremony. If i'm not mistaken, it is carried out twice a day. Its an interesting ceremony and tourist should grab the chance to watch it. The entrance fee is quite cheap and inside, you can take pictures and learn many Korean's history. There is also some place inside where you need to pay extra if you want to enter. Fir me, i just pay the initial entrance fee and spent around 2 hour visiting the palace. To go there, its quite easy using the subway."
1329,5.0,"This was a great temple to visit and you could easily spend a few hours wandering the grounds. It's especially nice to see lots of people in Korean traditional dress as it allows them free entry, but also adds to the atmosphere."
1330,5.0,"A must visit when in Seoul. Stunning and well-preserved architectures. Love the vast gardens, walkways and ponds. During my visit, there was a stage performance going on. It was interesting to see people in Hanboks walking around."
1331,4.0,"We are lucky to visit on a special festive day where entrance to the palace is free. We spent an hour or so walk around the palace and it was so chilly during autumn month. Beautiful gardens and clean environment, well maintained architecture & there are free tour around the garden (English speaking). Overall, this is a must-visit place if you are a first timer to Seoul, Korea."
1332,4.0,"Really interesting and huge palace compound. Try to see the small parade which is at 11 am and possibly 2 PM. There are so many building to walk around and see, and there is an English speaking tour twice a day at noon and possibly one later. Found it interesting but tour, at 1 hour, was too long for our Elem. age kids."
1333,5.0,Large estate where you can wander around or take a detailed audio tour Interesting to see the ancient dynasties. Lots of young girls in the traditional folk costumes also made for good people watching.  There's also a number of art galleries nearby so check out modern Seoul as well as heritage sites.
1334,5.0,The palace is huge and gives a good insight into Korean culture and dynastic lifestyle. don't miss the evening light and sound show encompassing several cultural events.( only foreigners allowed). make sure you carry your passports
1335,4.0,Definitely a must-visit when you travel to Seoul. This palace is very well-preserved and they are continuing with the restoration work.
1336,4.0,"Good attraction, large palace, different structures, Korean heritage. Went on a day when there was a cultural festival going on. Lot of youngsters wearing traditional and colourful dresses"
1337,3.0,"Nice place to explore. It's a huge complex so there are lots to see. The changing of the Palace Guards takes place at 11am.  What I didn't like was the large number of tourists during the peak hours. Some of them, especially those bus load of visitors from China tend to get really noisy and aggressive when taking selfies. I saw a bunch of them man handle the Palace Guard so that they can have that perfect selfies. So the best time to visit is early in the morning or at night."
1338,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is part of the itinerary of all the day tours in Seoul, which tells you that it is worth seeing, but as my husband and I discovered, it is an easy 20 minute walk from the City Hall neighbourhood where our hotel was located. In other words, it is possible to see come of the city's rich history even if you don't have much time to spare. The palace is an commanding structure and gives a real sense of the wealth and sophistication of Korea at the time when Europe was still emerging from the Middle Ages. But, the thing that we found most impressive was the pride and patriotism shown by the Korean people, many of whom were dressed in colourful, traditional costume. Gyeongbokgung Palace is the perfect solution if you are in Seoul on business and don't have much time but still want a taste of the country's history."
1339,4.0,"Since the culture is somehow similar, I'm not really interested in the palaces, but this one is nice, and if I must choose to go to 1 palace, it should be this one"
1340,5.0,They have this activity every day except Monday.The costumes of the guards are fantastic and then we took a tour of the palace
1341,4.0,The palaces all begin to look similar after a while. My advice would be to go to the museum first (especially if it's a hot day) and then try to figure out which palace you would like to see.
1342,4.0,"This place is really historical, will every single things you had seen on Korean Drama. The most impressive thing is when we worn hanbok we didn't have to buy entrance tickets. It's the way Korea brings their culture to the tourists."
1343,4.0,"Lovely palace to visit but not a lot of information in English. If you visit this palace, make sure you watch the guard ceremony. They explain it in Korean then translate to English. It was great to watch."
1344,4.0,"Definitely worth a visit. The terrain and architecture, buildings and gardens are all well maintained and beautiful. The admission is very inexpensive...great way to promote your city and draw in tourist."
1345,4.0,"This place is breathing with history, which contrasts so much with tall modern buildings in the background. Met lots of local girls in traditional costumes here. In hot weather you'll feel like being barbecued here;)"
1346,4.0,Strongly recommended from me - love the palace and the morning Guards changing. Take me back to the old days...
1347,5.0,Really bring you to the past. Changing guard ceremonial is always interesting. The guards wear the traditional costume where guests would love to take pictures with them.
1348,3.0,"It's a grand palace with huge open space. Well preserved architecture. It's now free admission in conjunction with Korea sale Festa. Good for sightsee and photo taking. To experience it fully, suit up in their traditional costumes first! After this palace, do go to Changdeokgung's secret garden for 5000won per entry. 10-15 mins walk east of Gyeongbokgung."
1349,5.0,Too beautiful place and all the place look like a picture too cause the tree and the lake 😍 If you are korean drama fans you will be crazy haha ;D cause you will see all the scenes in your eyes and you will know how big in gyeongbokgung palace It's very fun and beautiful place Full of Korea historical place and look :) Must do and come list in Korea!!!!
1350,5.0,"I had been to the palace in the day some years ago. Last week, I had the chance to go in for the night tour last week. Please go there at about 6:30 pm, to queue up for the foreigners' tickets, for entry at 7 pm (although they let the people in before then). The palace looked beautiful at night, because they lit it really well. It had a dance and a light show (every hour, I think). The reflections of the buildings and the trees in the lake were particularly impressive. Allow about an hour for the night tour and it was worth a visit. Pictures:"
1351,4.0,this is one place you should not miss when visiting seoul even for the first time. it has a lot to offer and don't forget to bring an umbrella or a hat to protect you from the scorching heat. too bad there was no personal tour guide to explain to us the different features of the palace.
1352,5.0,"Only seen palaces in kdramas but visiting and seeing first hand is awesome. i was literally in awe. the designs and architecture is definitely 👌🏼. Aside from the shopping, you need to set aside time to visit this"
1353,4.0,"This is typically a king palace during old time. When you experience Seoul in the first place, give a chance to come here and spend aprox. 2 hours to stroll around to the palace and national museum. If you happens to like history and place to photos then you might be spend more time there.  For me, it is good to go and take a look of changing guard ceremony at their official site or any blogger site available."
1354,5.0,This is a must see if you are visiting Seoul. It's beautiful and full of history. Very inexpensive stop and you can take endless photos. You will also see many people dressed in traditional outfits walking around. I loved it.
1355,4.0,"I give this 4 ratings because objectively, it is an amazing place though, honesty, it is not my favorite. Why? this place is crowded (like really crowded) and way too large (it takes hours to go round and check out the castle area). If you are really interested and eager to visit this place, plus you are a history geek, go ahead. But if you only want to take a beautiful picture in a typical Korean castle so you are able to post it on your social media, you'd better check other castle (e.g. Changdeokgung Palace). Other castle is just as beautiful and way less crowded. But, the thing is, this palace is like a must-visit-place when you are in Seoul, so it's all up to you. Once again, it's nice place but not my personal favorite."
1356,4.0,"Quite a cool place for pictures, palace is quite big so some substantial walking is needed. Has heritage and convenient mountains at the background while taking pictures. Good that there were no high rise buildings on that side of the city"
1357,4.0,"The area is very big and alot to see. But it's hard to take a good picture at the gate because it's always full of people. The sightseeing inside much more tranquil. I was in there at 11a.m and got a chance to see the guard changing. They only walked a few feet long so if you want to take picture, you have to be very quick"
1358,5.0,"This is my second time visiting. This palace is the biggest, oldest & main of the 5 palaces. This palace is huge so it takes a couple of hours at least that you need to wear comfortable shoes! It's located the center of seoul & surrounded by high buildings. You would enjoy relaxing & seeing the gorgeous palace!!"
1359,5.0,Just a beautiful historical i am amazed by the culture also keeping the palace well maintain i would love to come back !!!!
1360,4.0,First royal palace that you have to visit if you come to Seoul. Do not forget to take selfies with its guardians!
1361,4.0,"As the main palace complex, Gyeongbokgung stands as the biggest. There are a lot of things to see in this complex; thus, a guided tour is recommended if you have time to spare. As my friends and I were pressed for time, we just spent around an hour walking around the palace grounds while waiting for the Gate Guard Change Ceremony. Avoid visiting this place on sunny summer days, as the heat may be too unbearable. The complex also houses the National Palace Museum of Korea which has interesting exhibits and a quirky gift shop/cafe where you can stay in to cool down from the heat."
1362,4.0,Needs ability to walk and climb stairs huge property . Lovely grounds I went there during choseok and we were not charged a fee or else you have to pay a nominal amount to get in. Next to the palace is a Museum which is worth a visit. The Korean people are very gracious and helpful.
1363,5.0,Hanbok is Korean traditional costume and you can rent it around the palace and Insadong. I rent it at Insadong. The reason I mentioned it is I strongly recommend to visit THIS palace in Hanbok if you want to life long valuable picture in Korea! Also entrance fee is free when you are in Hanbok. Go to the ticket box and ask the tickets. Then you will get free tickets. It's very special experience walking in the historical site in tradtional costume. It was very exciting! The building was very great and felt that I was back in the days during Joseon Dynasty! Oh also this place is huge! Keep in mind !
1364,4.0,Gyeongbokgung Palace kept my attention for several hours when I visited. Its grounds are large and the palaces are beautiful! The entrance fee was $3 which enables a visit to their museum as well. It was well worth the time and $3.
1365,5.0,"I went there in the weekend it was busy and full of people. it was very large that you could enjoy taking pictures of different spots. three different performances are presented a day, attending one of them is enough they all seem the same and very simple. I would command the large changing ceremony. the palace is recommended for people who are interested in history and architect."
1366,5.0,"I was taken here as part of an organised business tour. The palace is well worth a visit, covering extensive grounds. We arrived in time to see the staged changing of the guard, which was a great spectacle. I most enjoyed the lake and gardens."
1367,5.0,Great for a visit during the day - take in the changing of the guard. Even better if you can visit in the evening - the Pavilion lit up with the sunset over the mountains was magical. We managed an evening visit when there was a musical evening. Very atmospheric with many visitors dressed in traditional costume.
1368,4.0,"The grounds here are beautiful and the structures are as well. The insides, the ceilings particularly are very intricate and colorful but nothing is original because 90% of it was torn down during Japanese occupation which is a shame. The restoration and rebuilding of the structures is very nice, so it is nice to imagine how it would have looked. There are also plaques all around that explain the buildings and it is worth looking up online before you go, but I wouldn't pay for a tour. I was teaching in Seoul and took my family (who was visiting) here in July of 2015 and they enjoyed it but once you have seen one palace in Korea you have seen them all. Doing the hop-on-hop-off bus tour is your best bet! Then you can spend as much time as you would like and move on."
1369,5.0,"Please join the free guided tour so that you know the history of the palace. The place is quite big, you can spend the whole day inside. You get free entry if you are in hanbok."
1370,4.0,"It's big, it's beautiful but if you shall get the most of the visit you should be there before 2pm and get a good spot to watch the change of the guards."
1371,5.0,"Eat. Sunblock. Comfy Shoes. The place is huge. Starts at 0900. You can try on the traditional dress and roam around the palace for free- just the dress. Entrance cost around 3500won. Afterwards, chill inside the national museum. If your lucky, you can watch the marching of guards. And so you know, tourist swarms all over the area."
1372,5.0,"This is definitely the must visit palace when you are in Seoul. This place is huge so be prepared to walk a lot. Entry is free if you are wearing Hanbok. If not, 6,000krw per pax. Hanbok can be rented from shops near the palace. We rented our Hanbok for 4 hours for 15,000krw per pax from a shop nearby.  Be sure to take lots of photo of the palace."
1373,5.0,I like this place very much. Learned about Korean history. It was very pretty and well kept. It was huge and exactly what we expected to see since I have watch lots of Korean movies and see the palace on screen before
1374,4.0,The Changing of the Guard was a great photo opportunity. The palace itself is interesting and a nice contrast with modern Seoul right outside the walls.
1375,5.0,"This is one of the Seoul ""Top 10"" attractions, but the reviews on Trip Advisor are not unanimously good - so I went wondering if it would be enjoyable, or a bit of a let-down. Well I'm pleased to be able to report that I thoroughly enjoyed it. I had a good walk around Gyeongbokgung Palace and also popped in to the Korean Museum of Folk Culture next door.  I found the Palace very interesting and rather impressive (I did not do a guided tour, I just walked round by myself). Entry is 3000 Won (around US$3, GBP£2) which is absolutely excellent value for money. There were quite a lot of locals there in traditional and very colorful dress, which really brightened the experience.  It took me 2 hours to have a really good look around and take my photos. The Folk Museum I mentioned earlier I do not recommend. I spent just 5-10 minutes in there and it will certainly be of much more interest to Koreans than to visitors. Nevertheless, entry was free so I'm not complaining... just advising!  I notice more than one review comparing Gyeongbokgung Palace with the Forbidden City in Beijing. Gyeongbokgung Palace is much smaller (although still occupying quite a large area) but quite similar in its layout and appearance. Please don't go to Gyeongbokgung Palace hoping or expecting to find an equal of the Forbidden City, but I think you will find something equally as interesting although rather less dramatic in scale.  The day I visited the weather was sunny. I would not advise going on a rainy day, I think that would totally spoil your visit.  Overall, very highly recommended."
1376,4.0,"A very nice place to visit, be with the historical atmosphere, go through Korean history with English translation device. outside there is a folklore singers with old tradition dresses."
1377,2.0,"Having seen the palace in China, the Gyeongbokgung Palace is really nothing in comparison. But it is still a history of Korea."
1378,3.0,It's quite a large place with lots of buildings but not a hell of a lot else. There's not a lot of information about the place historically or otherwise which is a real shame and some of the information is only in Korean. Definitely not a place to keep kids occupied.
1379,5.0,"Sept-2016) Great palace. It was a little too much walking for our my 8-yr old in addition to taking subway both ways...but he loved it.  We got the audio guide for 3,000 won.  The subway exit off line 5 (purple line) is gorgeous. You exit by Admiral Yi's statuei (?)...lots of photo ops."
1380,5.0,"Huge grounds, interesting history and stunning architecture. We did not take the guided tour, but wandered the grounds on our own, it is the oldest palace in Seoul. Expect to spend at least half a day here as this place cannot be properly seen in an hour. Insadong shopping neighborhood is about a 10 minute walk from the palace and is a must see in its own right as well."
1381,4.0,"I think the Royal Palace really is a must-see during your visit to Seoul, since this is a most spectacular building complex. I admire the wood-paintings, the structures of the roofs and the pavilions as such, since the inner decoration & the furniture has been destroyed wuring the war. The restoration of the building is done very well and it is nice to walk through the estate. The entrance ticket is not expensive - paying around 15 € for a family of 5. If you rent a hanbok you are entitled to free access. On a hot day it is quite tiresome to walk and make sure to bring some water."
1382,5.0,"This is really an incredible palace that is set right in the middle of the city. It's crazy how the palace just keeps going and going, much more than it appears from the outside. It's pretty cool to see the changing of the guard as well."
1383,5.0,"We visited this palace mainly to see the changing of the guard ceremony, but were pleasantly surprised by the beautiful architecture. It is the largest of the five (5) palaces and was built in 1395. It was destroyed by fire during the Japanese invasions in the 1500's, but rebuilt in 1867. In 1915 the Japanese returned to destroy most of the palace buildings, and built their colonial headquarters here. Many of the building and gates have been recently restored.  It was very peaceful at 9am and there were no crowds, so we were able to view the architecture at our own pace. The most impressive building was the Geunjeongjeon (Throne Hall) which had twelve pairs of stone markers outside and a huge throne to the rear of the building.  It will take approximately an hour to view the palace. The National Palace Museum is located outside the palace walls, but was closed (on Monday) when we visited. The Folk Museum is to the North East of the palace complex and admission here is free.  After viewing the palace grounds and visiting the folk museum, we got in position to view the changing of the guard ceremony which began at 10:30am. It was well choreographed, and we were able to take videos and photos of the entire ceremony. It is advised to get to the roped area as early as possible, as there was a huge crowd. The ceremony is done daily, except on Tuesday.  Admission was W3,000 for adults and W1,500 for children. It may be easily reached by taking subway line 3 to Gyeongbokgung Station, and using exit # 5."
1384,5.0,Huge grounds and lots of walking. Beautiful architecture and preserved or rebuilt buildings. We had the advantage of our own tour guide and that made the experience ever so better as there are very little explanations for self travellers.  We learned a good understanding of Korean architecture and engineering.  Also the garden at the back is beautiful with the lily pad filled Lake... Certainly worth a visit
1385,5.0,This is the biggest of the palaces in Seoul. Be prepared to spend 3 to 4 hours to see most of the area. They provide free tours for foreigners and locals on site so if you want to learn a bit about the history it's a great way to do so.
1386,4.0,One of the most iconic sights in all of Korea. Tips: 1. Reach Gyeongbokgung Palace before 10am 2. Do catch the Palace Gate Opening Ceremony & the Guards Changing 3. Try out the traditional costume experience! 4. Take a lot of beautiful pictures!
1387,5.0,"We followed a private tour around the palace, which was great! Oh, and rent a Hanbok and walk around the palace - the admission is free, and heaps of people will want to take photos with you - see what it's like to be a mini celebrity for a day!"
1388,4.0,It is very accessible from our hotel since it was a few blocks away. And we were able to have a quick tour of the palace in between our business meetings. At least plan half of your day when going here. Because the palace is very wide. You will appreciate the beauty of their structures and also their garden. You will be lucky to have a photograp with gilrs wearing their traditional dress costume without a cost. And also before going inside avoid touching the palace guards because it is prohibited.
1389,4.0,"Great Stuff, do not miss the Changing of Guard Ceremony 2 timer per day ( Selected ) Another great place visit and also another building located inside the palace ( National Folk Museum of Korea ), please go in and feel the history. Huge place that must be go ....."
1390,5.0,Fantastic spectacle. Watching the guards march to and from the courtyard took me bak in time. Ladies in local dress in evidence too.
1391,4.0,"Ok, so this is a nice place to visit and is really interesting to see such history in the middle of the city. There are very many people walking around, but I never felt too crowded as the ground are really large. The buildings are all very similar (as was the theme of the other palaces we visited), same architecture, colors, etc. there were so many little rooms which had no explanation. The grounds of the palace were mostly gravel, with the exception of the building in the middle of the water, but we could not figure out how to enter it. Nice experience, but I would not spend too much time there."
1392,5.0,One of the most beautiful palaces I have been to. The secret garden was worth the extra fee. I felt transported back into a time of princes and princesses. Vast courtyards and beautiful gardens where the royalty once escaped to find peace from the outside world. Cherry blossoms were in bloom to make this experience even more magical.
1393,5.0,"I have visited Gyeongbokgung four times in the last few years, the latest was this spring. The area is massive and I would highly recommend taking a tour if it is your first time to get the most out of the experience. The workers are very friendly and the changing of the guards is always fun to watch. Also make sure to check out the free National Folk Museum in the northeastern section of the complex."
1394,4.0,"This is a very nice palace, and I am glad I visited it, although you have to adjust your expectations if you visited similar ones in China. For example, there is no comparison with the Forbidden City! Having said so, I think you should visit it while in Seoul, and from there walk to the Bukchon Hanok Village to continue a day tour of the city."
1395,4.0,"Our hosts took us to this lovely palace when we first visited Seoul (in May 2012). We enjoyed the historic buildings, the beautiful gardens, and the changing of the guard ceremony. We also visited the National Folk Museum nearby and really enjoyed that as well. (Note: The folk museum has a good gift shop where we were able to buy some lovely gifts to take home to our family.)"
1396,5.0,"Vast area. Majestic main entrance. Beautiful compound. Very good for pictures.  You can see tourists / locals wearing traditional emperor era clothing when they visited this attraction. They actually make the whole experience even better because it gives you that ""feel"".  Be sure to walk all the way to the end and to also go into the museum. You get to learn a lot about the Korean culture and way of life from those days (way back). Enjoy!"
1397,4.0,"Three generations enjoyed the 2 hour tour of Gyeongbok Palace in sweltering heat. A group of English speaking enthusiastic teens met us as we emerged from the Metro with an offer to show us around for free, and we really appreciated their tour! Their historic stories helped us to see more than just just a collection of old beautiful buildings. At 2 PM plan to be in the big entry courtyard for the changing of the guard reenactment ceremony."
1398,4.0,Its a palace inside a city. You see buildings surrounding the palace. You have to pay to get further in the palace but outside is good enough to take nice photos. Location is very good with a train station just beside it!
1399,4.0,"We rented hanboks from OneDay Hanbok and it was pretty affordable. This grants you free entry and you get to take nice photos in the palace grounds. Many people will wear their hanboks there as well and you can take photos together in all your pretty outfits. Do note that if it's summer, youre probably going to sweat a whole lot."
1400,4.0,"Walkable from train station. Just before the stairs up from station you can get dressed in royal robes for free, was a fun activity. You can walk through the palace leisurely in your own pace. Good architecture in display, preserved well. You see lot of young couples walking around dressed in traditional costumes, lovely. Plenty of open park space inside. The food shop sells a cold rice sweet drink (non-alcoholic) that was tasty."
1401,4.0,"Must see when in Seoul! Unfortunately it was a sunny sunny day when we visited so husband got tired of walking in the sun and stayed hiding in café. I walked around and took many nice pictures. Amazing feeling to walk around in this peaceful getaway and imagine how it used to be. You have a lovely mountain view in background and other sides surrounded by modern buildings outside the walls.. Inside walls pure pleasure and there is a café inside, and near museum. Not adjusted to walk with stroller or wheelchair from what we could see. Easy to reach by sub and taxi. Recommend it!"
1402,4.0,Join the free tour if possible. Detailed explanation. Don't miss the changing guard ceremony! It's a nice watch. Enjoyed the walk overall
1403,5.0,"This is a very big place, we spent 3-4 hours there and it was a lovely long walk. If you're wearing hanbok (Korean outfits), you can just go to ticket office and get the tickets for free."
1404,5.0,"It's beautiful palace, nice garden, we have learned lots of history. It has been took by China before. They had build the dragon inside to believe that China never got the Korea before. It's beautiful garden, lake and surrounding. It's totally the center, it's not far away from the Mydeong distric by train 15 mins."
1405,5.0,Went to Korea for a Rotary International Convention in 2016. Took an extension tour after and this palace was included on the tour. Fascinating place. The water you see in the cover picture would freeze in the winter and the locals used to ice skate on it!
1406,4.0,"These grounds have over 50 buildings, but you only get detail of about 10-12 during this tour, which is more than enough. It took about 70min to see the buildings we did. Lots of detail and interesting history."
1407,5.0,"First of all, this place should be called 'Gyeongbokgung' not 'Gyeongbokgung Palace'. 'gung' means palace in Korea.  I think that Gyeongbokgung is must-see place if someone never had an experience to visit. It's a full package of Korean traditional culture. The palace is beautifully designed and technically built. If you can borrow audio service device, try one. You won't regret it. It's much more interesting when you know the background. Its admission fee is reasonable like KRW 3000(= USD $2), but it's free if you wear Korean traditional custom. There are many rental shop near the palace. Don't miss it. There are few shade to hide from sun outside. If it's hot outside, visit this place some other time."
1408,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is a must go in Seoul. It's one of the main palace. The grounds are beautifully kept and the buildings are characteristic. Try to join the guided tour and spend time appreciating the settings, history and culture of Korean."
1409,5.0,"I would recommend entering at the front gate during the changing of the guards. I can't remember exact time it happens. But was a great experience to see the whole ceremony. Once inside, there is so much to see. So be prepared to walk a lot and take lots of pictures. Really beautiful palace."
1410,5.0,"The palace complex is huge, with a myriad of buildings and acres of grounds to explore.  Firstly don't make the rookie mistake we did - visiting on a Tuesday, when the palace is closed! On returning on Wednesday we were pleasantly surprised to be told that entry on that day was free (not sure that this applies to every Wednesday). In fact, anyone wearing traditional dress gains free entry, but tickets are not expensive at 3000krwon per person over 18, with a small discount for children and teenagers.  This is a restoration / reconstruction project on a massive scale, which is being done sensitively and artistically. Photo opportunities abound, particularly changing the guard and the traditional tea ceremony and, of course, the people (mostly very pretty young ladies) wearing traditional Hanok dress, who are only too happy to pose.  There is a sparsity of shade, so do take this slowly in the heat. There are cafes and toilets around, but a few bottles of water per person is a must as the heat and humidity can become overwhelming.  Allow two to three hours and do try to make your way to the back of the complex, where there are ornamental lakes with pagoda."
1411,5.0,"OK, where to start. Allow min half day or more. Come bright and early for the changing of the guards ceremony. Bring plenty of food and water, don't forget to charge your camera and good shoes. Not much refreshments available on the premises so come prepared. If you want to wear a hanbok dress, there are plenty of shops where you can hire them for 1.5hrs - 2 hrs outside the palace. I believe the prices start on 15000 KWR for 1.5hrs. It's a great opportunity to take your pictures in this wonderful setting and ""IN style"" throughout the complex. Definitely worth a visit is also the Folklore Museum with its wonderful restorations of Korean past. The Korean Folklore village's reconstruction is very illustrative and worth a visit for every foreigner. The museum is within a complex and the entry is free. If you need to wind down, there is a small garden towards the north of the complext where you can e.g. let the kids to let some steam out. It's very tranquil there and with offers lovely views. Free 1hr long guided tours are offered on the hour at the entrance. We left the palace by one of the side entrances and enjoyed a well deserved meal in a small restaurant in Bukchon. Great day out."
1412,4.0,I had literally just been to the Forbidden City in Beijing so this did feel a bit small. It's beautiful and worth visiting along with the Folk Museum which is on the same sight. From here you can also walk to nearby Buk Chon village. If you combine all these activities then I'd rate this five star. If you're keen on trying traditional Korean cultural dress you can hire costumes near to the palace - then wear your costume and get free entry. You'll also get lots of tourists asking to have photos with you.
1413,5.0,"If you are a big fan of Korean dramas (especially if you've watched ""Rooftop Prince"") you might come and visit this gigantic palace! Come to the place earlier in the morning or around 2p.m. then you might be able to watch the soldiers changing their duty. If you are luck, you might get to see some performance through out the day! Remember, Tuesday is closed and the admission fee is $3000 won/person."
1414,4.0,We visited without a tour guide. I would recommend getting one to help explain what you are seeing. Get ready to do some walking. The grounds are mainly covered with course sand. The National Palace Museum is nearby withing the grounds and a good place to cool off on a hot humid day and get a drink. Beautifully restored structures are well worth the time.
1415,4.0,Th building is beautiful and has a lot of history - not very much liked by the Japanese because of the way they treated the koreans in the past.
1416,5.0,"Amazing place, the architecture, granduer, history. English is on each explanation board. Enjoyed myself, i am a History buff."
1417,4.0,"One of the major attraction in Seoul. Probably not as big as China's Gu Gong Palace but since you're in seoul, why not. Most impressive is probably at the front as you enter from the main Gate. As you walk further in, palace gets smaller and more smaller living quarters and they are all look similar. Entry fee is very reasonable ($3,000 WON) and it's pretty easy to get to via subway station. Overall it was a good experience to see the real thing compare to korean drama on TV. :)"
1418,3.0,"The site, the palace structures and the gardens were beautiful. However, I would say there wasn't much to see. Most of the palace housings were locked and those that were open had few or no exhibits within. Going free and easy without a guide will not give you much insight into the Korean traditions or palace life.  However, if you wear a hanbok to the palace, you will be granted free entry. There is a hanbok rental a few minutes walk from the train station. If the weather permits, wearing a hanbok would be a really good idea as you can be assured that your pictures will turn out fabulous. There is no need to feel embarassed as well as many visitors do that :)"
1419,5.0,"Nice palace, lots to walk around, very nice gardens, easy to reach, and very nice to see young Koreans there visiting on their weekend and wearing their beautiful traditional cloths. Recommended to visit."
1420,3.0,"A very nice place for people who are interested in the history of Koreas monarchy. The place offers beautiful temples and quite a bit of beautiful nature, in form of secret garden for example. All in all a place to visit when you want to learn a little bit of Koreas history"
1421,5.0,"They are not really set up for tourism just yet, but if you are visiting South Korea, make the effort to visit ALL the cultural sites; you will be gob-struck at the history. Just stunning!"
1422,5.0,Gyeongbokgung Palace is a beautiful palace with lots of history and is sure not a place to miss. It must be on top of your things to do while in Seoul. Be especially mindful of when the ceremony of the changing of the guard occurs as it is a sight to see. It is easy to find and take some walking shoes as there will be a lot of walking.
1423,4.0,Went to palace and viewed a lot the museums as not bad it's inside the palace there is a lot to see things to do the changing of the guards and people wearing traditional close people from all over come to See one of the many palaces In Korea it's a sight to see
1424,5.0,"a must see in seoul. walk thru the huge complex and imagine life as the emperor. the locals get in free if they wear the traditional korean wear so we, as tourists, get to see young men/women inside the palace, enhancing the authentic experience."
1425,4.0,"This is the bigger of the 2 imperial palaces. Personally, I like the other one. Go see this one just because that's what you do; just like one visits the Statue of Liberty in nyc because that's what you do when you are in nyc. Just a bunch of buildings that very much resemble Chinese palaces. One cannot go in the building, just stand outside and look in through the openings. They do try to make up for it by having re enactments and ""changing of the guard"" type ceremony."
1426,5.0,Booked a free Seoul walking tour for this palace. There were a lot of people over the weekend. However the palace is beautiful. The tour enhanced the palace experience adding much depth to the visual experience of this place. Although this palace was restored it doesn't diminish its importance to Korea and how crucial it has been to the existence of this nation.  The changing of guard ceremony is something not to be missed. It provides an experiential bridge to its glorious past and is one of the highlights of this palace visit.
1427,5.0,Gyeongbokgung Palace was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty. The architectural principles of ancient Korea were incorporated into the tradition and appearance of the Joseon royal court.
1428,4.0,We joined a free English guided tour of the Gyeonbokgung palace and enjoyed learning about the history of Korea as well as lovely views of the palace. At the end we also had access to the museum and we took the time to look at the exhibits as well.
1429,5.0,"I had visited the Palace when I lived in Seoul nearly 20 years ago and the opportunity to return was worth the wait. Numerous and ongoing restorations have been taking place since 1990, the latest having been completed in 2010. The serene beauty of the Palace is in start contrast to the surroundings of bustling Seoul. A breathtaking experience."
1430,4.0,"There are a few palaces, we decided to just see 1 and chose this one. Easy to walk to from myeongdong, 3000 entrance fee per person and you can join a free tour in English (as at the info office) it's also nice to see the changing of the guard. If you don;t want to take a tour pick up a map at the info office just after the entrance and follow it to visit all the main buildings, we were there for a couple of hours - take a break for coffee in the library (i think it was building number 9 on the map). I think it is worth a visit. We went on a Thursday at 12:00 and it was not at all crowded."
1431,5.0,"Lovely scenery. It is very well kept, entrance fee is low, free for elderly. I really enjoyed the walk, relaxing and beautiful. The museum was very interesting too."
1432,5.0,"Our visit to the palace was perfect. There was an event (Royal Culture Festival) being held that time and we were able to see and experience the re-enactment of the Royal Feast of 1892. Locals dressed up in traditional outfits complete with props. The event lasted for about an hour, it includes a Korean, English, and Chinese narrative of the event. A very colorful and lively place, it's a must-see!"
1433,3.0,"This is a great palace to visit for site seeing and photo taking. However, the day I went with family, was Korea Culture Day and it was overcrowded with locals and tourists. Also, without a guided english tour guide, we were quite lost in the palace. I prefer the Changdeokgung Palace over Gyeongbokgung Palace."
1434,4.0,Went there on a weekend and it was extremely crowded. A lot of your groups all around.  But it is still worth visiting to have a look and feel of KoreA's history. A few locals (I assume) wear their traditional clothing to walk around which made our visit a little more fun when we spot them.  Managed to catch the guard changing ceremony and they are really very professional considering that these people are doing it to 'showcase' the history and not the 'real guards' from the past.
1435,4.0,Second time to see the palace. Absolutely love it. I don't know much about Korean history but it is still well worth the visit. Admission is cheap. Very picturesque. Not grand and awe inspiring like Beijing's forbidden city but certainly more picturesque. Museum within the grounds worth a look as well.
1436,3.0,"We came to Seoul from Japan so have seen plenty of shrines/temples, especially around Kyoto.  I have to admit the palaces in Seoul aren't as wow in comparison. Additionally I thought Changdeokgung Palace was actually better to visit as it was considerably less crowded and looks remarkable the same as Gyeongbokgung except smaller."
1437,5.0,"We were approached by a free English speaking guide group at the train station who offered to take us through the palace and the grounds, we were hesitant at first but went ahead and found it very helpful and informative.  The palace and private buildings of the royal family and officials were amazing and the palace grounds are massive, definitely a must see if ever in Seoul. Make sure you go on a clear day so you can get the best view of the palace."
1438,5.0,"I wasn't expecting much because I had been there before on a tour package (too rushed). But this time I went free&easy with friends and had time to explore the palace grounds. There was such a beautiful calm as I took in the sights of the palace architecture, the trees, ponds, mountains...that my heart was moved. I will recommend a leisurely pace to explore the place, then walk to tosokchon for some good ginseng chicken soup."
1439,3.0,"After visiting Japan, we visited koreas main attraction. We were met by rude staff at the ticketing box as well as upon entry (not surprised after experience with the locals there). You payabout $3 usd to get in and you are unable to actually enter the palace, you can only see from the outside. The other surrounds are mainly restored buildings that were equally as unimpressive. The grounds are all rubble upon entry so expect your shoes to get dirty. Overrated!"
1440,5.0,Be sure to catch the changing of the guards. I was there during the weekend so lots of people and school children. Buildings are beautiful to look at and some parts are so tranquil. I was lucky to catch the tail end of the cherry blossoms.
1441,4.0,Loved this palace especially as we timed it for the very colourful changing of the guard at 10.am . If over 65 bring your passport for free entry
1442,5.0,Really nice architecture and color. It's interesting to see this ancient building with the backdrop of modern Seoul. Cool visit.
1443,5.0,"This is my first time visiting Seoul, and most of friends and relatives told me the Gyeongbokgung Palace is super tiny and simple, comparing to Chinese or Japanese ones, and not worth a visit. We visited it anyway, and it's totally worth it.  PROs: It's easy access from the subway station ""Gyeongbokgung,"" about 5-10 minutes walk. We joined a free English tour, and I highly recommended. (The English tour is offered at 11:00, 13:30, and 15:30.)Yes, the palace is small, comparing to even an ancient Chinese nobleman's house, but it is still a beautiful palace full of Korean history and culture for the visitors to learn. The tour guide spoke good English and was very informative about the traditions, architecture, and the history of the palace and the royal families. There is a beautiful garden at the back of the palace with a small pond.  CONS: It could get quite noisy and crowded with lots of tourists and students on field trips."
1444,5.0,"Was an enjoyable experience. Changing of the guard is a must see. Enjoyable gardens, water, palace, and great views. Close enough to everything like N Seoul Tower. Well worth it to go."
1445,4.0,"I went at the start of April where the Sakura flowers were in full bloom,it was absolutely beautiful in the palace filled with ancient architecture and plenty of flowers around,just that it is pretty packed with tourists,do search for the change of guard duties timings to go,that's when it gets abit more interesting,they have little tours to explain to you about the palace,if you are not interested,that's okay,just walk around ,feel like royalty and take in the pretty views.another side note,if you wear the traditional hanbok in,u get free entrance and great pictures,you can rent it at nearby stores,the last I have heard,it was 15k won for four hours rental,pretty much a good deal.have fun!"
1446,4.0,Its not too far to reach this place from N Seoul tower.. We can find a an ancient culture of korea right here. I recommend you to visit this place by local guide to tell you more about this place..
1447,5.0,beautiful architect.. beautiful location.. it has it all. make sure to get pictures clicked in their traditional attire
1448,4.0,"Also known as Palace of Shinning Happiness, the largest palace of the five grand palaces built by the Joseon Dynasty.  Please remember, palaces closed on every Tuesday. Not free admission.  A must stop: Heungnyemun Compound - witness the 15 minute long Changing of the Royal Guard ceremony  Gyeonghoeru pavilion - visitors can dress up in a traditional gatekeeper’s uniform or in royal court attire and take photographs in front of Gyeonghoeru (free but be there early to get your Q number)  Geunjeongjeon Hall - The throne hall, important state functions once held here  Hyangwonji Pond - looking over the Hyangwonjeong Pavilion  The National Folk Museum of Korea - admission free if you purchased Gyeongbokgung Palace ticket (keep the ticket to show the ticket officer)  Gwanghwamun - a short changing guard ceremony held here too."
1449,2.0,A national pride for the South Koreans. For me just a miniature version of the Chinese palaces. So in Seoul a must visit.
1450,5.0,"Beautiful palace grounds , lots of interesting spots. You need to allow yourself more time at this place as it is huge. There is a cafe and souvenir shop inside. Also check out the museum there. Definitely worth a visit."
1451,3.0,This is a great historical site. One can easily spend a whole day here. Things to notice. Make sure to pack food and drinks as there is no food stand available here. There is only a small snack bar that ONLY offers coffee and a few child drinks.
1452,4.0,Vast palace with many buildings. Just when you think you've seen it all you find more. The ceremonial changing of the guard is worth seeing too. It was about 10am.  Fantastic place to wander around and see some beautiful buildings and cherry blossom.  The national folk museum of Korea is next door and worth a visit.
1453,5.0,"If you are in Seoul, that's the Nr. 1 not to be missed part of the city. Fanastic experience, felt myself in the ancient time. Perfect if you are on business trip and just have a few hours till your transfer to the airport. Main entrance is recommended to use for entry - but for exit, it is much more better to use the side one which takes you to the Bukchon Hanok Village which has been a traditional residential area for 600 years. Full of traditional and modern small houses, cafes, shops, unforgettable epxerience walking on the small streets of it!"
1454,5.0,This is a large complex with many buildings and interesting history. It's centrally located and a definite must see site for Korean culture and history
1455,5.0,"I went there a week ago. It was a large palace complex, reachable by metro station, just follow the brown line and exit at gyeongbokgung station. there were 3 guards at the gate and you can take selfie with them, although they have stiff faces. the admission ticket is quite cheap about 3,000 won or US$ 0.23. The palace complex is not as large as Forbidden city but the architecture is superb. the throne room is quite impressive, but i notice that some of the walls and ceiling just recently painted. overall its a must do whne you visit seoul. the sejong statue at the sejonh square is located in front of the gyeongbokgung gate."
1456,5.0,3 bucks to walk around this amazing place for a couple hours. Had a great time. Highly recommended. Museum was nice.
1457,5.0,It is a gorgeous area to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. A small oasis in the middle of Seoul. Don't visit the city without stopping here.
1458,5.0,"On select days out of the year, the Gyeongbok Palace (Gyeongbokgung) in Seoul, South Korea opens its doors for night-time tours. Tickets are limited, but I was lucky to snag a ticket in March 2016, to experience the nocturnal event.  The ticket itself was cheap (just 3,000 Korean Won, or $2.50 USD), and the experience was really outstanding. I'd highly recommend it if you ever get a chance to go, especially if you can bring a loved one with you. The experience is really quite romantic."
1459,5.0,"I had lived in Korea for 6 months before I finally saw Gyeongbokgung Palace. I took my family - including my 4 year old sister - here and everyone loved it! Plenty of space for kids to run around, and there is even a children's museum and a small playground on the northern edge of the palace. The place just keeps going and going and it's all so beautiful. Time your visit so you can see the ceremony in front of the gate-it's very colorful and mesmerizing, something that even little kids will love."
1460,5.0,"Of the four major Palaces in Seoul, I think this was my favourite. To a certain extent, they are look the same - the architectural styles, roof lines, colours and materials are all pretty similar to the eyes of a westerner like me. They're pretty, but pretty similar. Two of them have spectacular changing of the guards ceremonies - not to be missed if you can time it - this Palace, Gyeongbokgung (""gung"" means palace anyway), and Deoksugung. So by visiting this Palace. you'll see Palace guards and maybe the changing thereof. It is big - with water bodies, lots of out buildings, and pretty vistas. There's clean free toilets, benches to sit on, and a café serving coffee (take -out as you walk around the grounds or sit down) and sweets. Young Koreans (mainly girls but some young men too), can get into Palaces for free if in traditional costume, and there are outlets which hire these costumes (but not shoes - they all seem to be wearing trainers!). So the Palace was full of them, on a fine sunny Sunday afternoon, all taking their selfies. And they are happy to have their pictures taking by or with foreign tourists. Sometimes the gaggle of girls in their pretty dresses couldn't get away from the queues of tourists lining up to have their photos taken with them in front of the Palace buildings. Gyeongbokgung had the most to offer in terms of beautiful views and the changing of the guards."
1461,5.0,Ancient Korean architecture representing the countries formal dynastic periods preserved to show off the wonderful Korean culture.
1462,5.0,"At only $3,000 Korean Won approximately $2.80 you can't beat the price. It also includes admission to the museum on premise. The restoration of the buildings is exquisite. You can feel the skill that many artisans used in creating such a lovely palace. It is large and can easily last all day, so come early."
1463,4.0,Firstly this isn't as huge as Beijing's Forbidden City which was my initial worry. Try your best to get a guided tour and listen to the history of this place and its past occupants. Also try to catch the changing of the guards show and take photos with the guys in traditional uniform and halberds. This palace is also a short walk to Bukchon village area and Insadong.
1464,5.0,I thought the palace won't be that big. But the truth is it tremendously big. Two hour won't be enough to look around read the information and take photos.
1465,5.0,If you don't have a tour simply Wikipedia this palace and you can find brief explanations on each part of the palace. The museum near the north side was very interesting and put together well.  This is definitely a must place to go if your visiting for the first time.  Only about $3000 Won per adult. No student discounts.
1466,4.0,As we only had one day off in Seoul it was not easy to choose the best attraction to visit. But this palace was a good choice. I learnt a lot about Korean history and enjoyed beautiful architecture.
1467,4.0,It was good to see the palace. We would recommend this if you are into architecture and history. We enjoyed it.
1468,4.0,"This place is looks like small version of China Forbidden City, Which is a lot of Chinese touch inside. If you want to walk all around the palace it will take around 1-2 hours. And I recomend you to visit around 10.00; 13.00 and 15.00 since they have guard changing ceremony. The ticket fare is KRW 3000 to enter only the Palace and they have offer bundle ticket with the museum."
1469,5.0,There are free English tours during the morning and afternoon which are very informative and very well explained. I highly recommend going on them.  It is a lovely day out. The palace in spring is noisy lovely due to the flowers but it is equally as interesting in winter.
1470,5.0,"I went there first thing in the morning and to my surprise, was a tour in Japanese. So, I joined them, although I had no clue what the guide was talking about. But a couple of Japanese tourists, after realizing I speak no Japanese, they were so nice and translated me lots of things the guide was telling them. Plus, I had a nice brochure with English text that was very useful. Lots of things to see there. From beautiful old buildings and amazing decorations to beautiful landscaped and spacious gardens. Highly recommended."
1471,4.0,"My husband and I braved the cold over the weekend to take an hour tour (in English!), and we are so glad we did! Our guide was knowledgeable, and it was exceedingly helpful to have the sites pointed out and the history and significance explained."
1472,3.0,"Seoul has 5 palaces. This is the biggest and most important one, so if you want to see a Palace then this is the one to visit. Its pretty large with lots of beautiful buildings. I don't know what more to say about this place..  We did pop into the adjacent Folk Museum which is included in the ticket price. This had some interesting things and worth an hour of your time.  We bought some street food outside on the road after leaving the folk Museum. One type was like a round bread that is hollow in the center and the others were small round cakes with a jam inside. Both really tasty and cheap. This may have been the highlight of the Palace visit."
1473,4.0,"Large territorial palace grounds with many gates to enter. I enjoyed walking around, though, I did not have enough time to see it all as it it huge. For that reason, I would recommend having around 3-4 hours designated for the palace and its ground. The palace consists of many courts, pavilions, bridges, gardens and walkways. It also houses the National Folk Museum and the National Palace Museum of Korea which I would recommend to visit as well.This Palace is very historical as it is main palace of the Joseon Dynasty. As the grounds are large, it requires a lot of walking; however there are benches and cafes around. It is wheelchair accessible."
1474,4.0,This palace is a must during any visit to Seoul. Friendly staff and very informative signboards help you navigate your way around the beautiful grounds.  Make sure you exit out the back gate and take a look at the presidential residence.
1475,5.0,"I have an opportunity to visit this place on my trip to south korea. This place is so amazing! As a fan of some korean dramas like Jang Geum and Ju Mong, I really enjoyed the place. Like ive been in some history book or something. Admission is free during lunar new year, so i expected it to be full of tourists."
1476,4.0,"While it is possible to roam through the grounds on your own, I would suggest joining one of their free tour if possible to get the most out of the visit.  Timing of the tours can be found at English website royalpalace.go.kr/html/eng/guide  Maybe because this palace is pretty accessible, it is crowded with tour groups and visitors even though it is not a UNESCO site. So between Changdeokgung & Gyeongbokgung, I actually prefer Changdeokgung though Gyeongbokgung is more majestic for those structures which are completed (our tour guide says that it is only about 30% restored after being damaged during war times)  You can get a combined ticket for 10,000won to visit 5 of Seoul's major cultural sites (Jongmyo, Changdeokgung, Gyeongbokgung, Gyeonghuigung, Deoksugung) which is more economical. Just remember to ask for it when you make your purchase at the ticket booth or the attendant will just dish out the single standard ticket. Alternatively, if you happen to be in Seoul during the last week of the month, you can gain entry to all cultural sites for free on Wed as the last Wed of each month is designated as their cultural day."
1477,4.0,"this palace located in the heart of Seoul,try to visit this Palace in the morning to avoid crowd. total time required to go around the complex will be around 45 minutes"
1478,5.0,Its worth a visit to see the well preserved historic palace and to hear about its history. great wall painting on the ceilings.
1479,4.0,The palace grounds were very expansive and maintained really well. You would need at least half a day to cover everything. We visited during winter so it wasn't too crowded.
1480,5.0,"This is the biggest palace in South Korea, if you really wanna explore everything and learn its history you could take up to half a day. I was lucky to be able to witness the guard changing process while also exploring the beauty of this palace. Going there in Winter also allowed me to slowly explore it without having to worry about the heat. If you're into history and culture, this place is for you"
1481,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung is a huge place, and has a ton of buildings across it. The ones that can be seen into have gorgeous floors and some have authentic furniture to show how the residents lived. I just wish you could go into more of them, because there's only a handful you can even look into, so for the most part, you're just walking around inside the huge maze of buildings. When the flowers bloom, it's absolutely beautiful though. We have been several times and it never gets old."
1482,3.0,"As my wife likes history and has been watching some Korean dramas relating to this period in time, we had to come and visit when we visited Korea. We watched the changing of the guards and spent an afternoon looking around. It was okay, pity you can't actually go inside the buildings (which are empty). It would be nice to visit here in the summer months."
1483,2.0,"First time to Seoul and first time to their Gyeongbokgung place to let me have a better understanding about their Korea culture. This palace was a huge place, how the lifestyle of being a royal family. If you have not been Seoul before, visiting the palace is quite a good experience besides shopping. You can spend at least 2 hours or more there. To see their engraved geomancy rooftops, warehouses to store their stuff, traditional dances and their culture."
1484,3.0,nice to spend 2hrs walking around. Do plan to time your visit along with the change of guards. it's on the hour. There's also free trying of guard costumes.
1485,5.0,"The palace is beautiful, try to see the guard change it is really impressive and beautiful, colors everywhere."
1486,5.0,There is a shop outside palace to rent Korean clothes for an hour to take pictures in palace which is worth and fun with great memories.
1487,5.0,"This was my second visit and it still takes my breath away,truly beautiful.There is a wonderful museum on the grounds and it is worth making sure to see the guard changing ceremony which occurs at 10am 1pm and 3pm. Closed on Tuesdays and entrance fee is only W3000 and museum is free,allow plenty of time as we were there most of the day as it's so big. Subway to Gyeongbok station Line 3 Exit 5 which takes you right outside.If you only visit one palace this should be the one."
1488,5.0,So glad we were able to see this amazing palace in the center of Seoul with its fascinating history and beauty. Free English guided tour provided at different times of the day that last about an hour (last one was at 1430 the day we went) and covers the important points/areas in the palace. Go prepared to do some walking - large palace grounds - and early to avoid the afternoon crowds too!!!
1489,5.0,We were visiting rainy day. It is beautiful and i really like palace's small lake and boat. Also palace ´s buildings are like a korean drama. It is so interesting. Myengdong street and king's (i don't remember king's name )square are very closer from here.
1490,5.0,"My second visit to Gyeongbokgung palace in Dec 2015. I was initially planning to visit Changdeokgung to see the secret garden but missed the guided tour for 2 days. Hence I took my friend to Gyeongbokgung - since it's the first palace built. Magnificient as ever and that again explains why I love korea. A mix of traditional within a modern city with lots of history and rich culture in it. This visit to Gyeongbokgung really got me so interested that I found myself reading up on the palaces, history till present day, traditions and culture about the charming city! ( It's the first time I got so interested in history)."
1491,5.0,"We got lucky and visited on a Saturday when there were volunteer tour guides available (and they spoke English). It was amazing! We learned so much while we were there and the palace itself, even though it had to be reconstructed (that is a very sad part of their history) is absolutely stunning! It is amazing they were able to build such a place."
1492,5.0,"This palace is the most famous in Seoul. One is really after not how the palaces look like but the fantastic ceremonies and shows which come with the palace. There are schedules for the changing of the guards and sword exhibitions in the morning and afternoon. Check their website for the exact time. We came in at 2pm and was just in time for the ceremony. Full costumes, parade of colors, and the use of rituals depict a lot of authenticity and appreciation for Korea's colorful culture. This is a really must-visit for history buffs, families, Korea drama afficionados, and those who are interested in Korea's interesting culture."
1493,4.0,"A nice palace, and also the change of guard duty are interesting. Also, you can try on to be the guard duty by trying their uniform! It's cool! But wearing the uniform in cold weather made me shivers so much. The palace is huge and has nice interior and exterior for photo taking."
1494,3.0,The Palace is big and takes some time to walk around. While it is popular the really isn't a great deal to look at. An audio guide is available to hire or you can pay to dress up in traditional clothing. Pictures are available for free with the Sentry's standing at the front gate
1495,4.0,"I've been spoilt. Having lived and travelled in China for a few years, I have been fortunate enough to see a range of magnificent and quirky palaces and temples. This one is interesting enough, but not to the same degree (sorry, S. Korea). It has all been nicely restored and there is some interesting architecture but it appears to be a collection of similar buildings in a big dirt courtyard. Perhaps it was the time of year or because we didn't take a guide, but most of the buildings were shut and the open ones had little inside. No nice lakes, gardens, peculiar buildings or shrines and we felt we'd seen enough after about thirty minutes. HOWEVER, we were then trapped inside by the changing of the guard. The front of the Palace is guarded and the costumes are amazing. If you are that way inclined, you can get selfies standing right next to them. The changing involves many more soldiers than just the seven out front, all led by a traditional band that includes someone blowing a conch shell. Explanations are in English too so you can follow what it going on. One of the highlights of my trip.  Note that it was free on the day I visited but I'm not sure why. Ticket booths were closed."
1496,5.0,Big and beautiful palace. Would be good to participate in the guided tours which would make your visit more meaningful
1497,4.0,"if you like traditional architecture and photography,this is the place for it. make sure you are wearing good walking shoes and bring some water with you and take your time. you can either follow a tour or go on your own."
1498,4.0,"Came there as it's a tourist attraction. Although it's quite small, it's possible to know more about Korean culture. Anyway, it's a good place to take some photos for your vacation. In addition, you can get free entrance if you wear the Han-bok when visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace."
1499,3.0,"Came to watch the Changing Of The Guards Ceremony but was quite disappointed at how boring it was, considering the hype and other reviews. Felt cheated that I queued and bought the entrance tickets when so many others simply walked in without showing theirs due to how crowded it was. Beautiful place rich in history but not that great an experience."
1500,5.0,"Don't miss the guard changing ceremony at 11am, 2pm and 4pm.  Take pictures with the guards at the main gate.  It is also easily accessed via mrt line 3 to Gyeongbokgung Exit 5.  And enjoy the palace."
1501,4.0,"This was a great place to visit but I was expecting just a bit more. Maybe more luxury or Artistry than other places I've been. Don't get me wrong, this place is great to admire. I was banking is spending at least 3 hours and I was done by 1 1/2 and that's included the change of guards. Bring your comfortable shoes and don't worry about the collection of dirt and dust"
1502,5.0,A beautiful serene and tranquil place to get away from the city though surrounded by buildings. The place is decorated with a beautiful past of the Joseon Era and superb place for phototaking. Don't forget to watch the guards changing ceremony at 1pm at the main square.  Conveniently located near a subway station. There are other museums nearby if you have of plenty time to walk around.
1503,4.0,Easily accessible by subway at Gyeongbokgung station. Grand palace and huge area to walk around. You can go to the National museum next to it and there's a cafe next to the museum for you to fill your stomach.
1504,5.0,"The Royal Palace is a must see when in Seoul but give yourself plenty of time because there's a lot to see. Upon arrival, don't be discouraged if there are a lot of people out front. Once inside, you won't notice them because the Palace sits on a sizable amount of land. It's also incredibly quiet inside, which was amazing because there is much traffic and noise right outside. There a many buildings to see when inside the gate and try to see the pavilion in the moat off to the left. This is a beautiful area. Make sure you look up while looking inside the buildings as well and outside the buildings. There are many detailed carvings and paintings all around. The grounds are beautifully manicured as well and very clean. We didn't receive a map when we arrived so you may want to get some info off the internet before you go. I believe there are several hundred buildings to see. There is a gift shop and museum. There are also live soldiers posing out front as statues."
1505,5.0,"It's my third visit and this place never fail to impress me. I was here during Spring, Summer, Autumn. Avoid the main stretches as it will be filled with tourist crowd."
1506,4.0,"Interesting tradition displayed. You must know the specific time of the guard exchange ceremony. Otherwise, you will have to wait for a long time. Visiting the palace is considered incomplete without seeing the unique ceremony. A good thing is that the announcements made are in 3 languages - korean, japanese and english language. Don't forget to bring your sunglasses..."
1507,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung is an excellent place to visit not because it is the oldest, grandest, prettiest or historically most relevant. It is an excellent visit because you are allowed to roam around to explore the palace without many ""keep out"", ""do not enter"" signs. You can see how the whole palace is put together by looking at it from different angles. You must also make sure to book your guided tour to the Secret Garden. We were there during the Fall and the color of the leaves brought out the best of the garden. If you have time to read a little about the Korean history, it will definitely add to the experience."
1508,3.0,"Well, there is really nothing much to rave about in this palace. Maybe because I have been to other asian palaces and therefore have high expectation. Though I must say that the free tour guide provided at the information centre is very good. It gives an insight to the palace and gives understanding to some of the building structures, such as chimney towers that are not noticeable. Heating under the building provided via tunnels.  To its defence, I supposed because the palace was burnt down during the early Japanese/Korean war, much of the original details in the palace was missing. There is not much grandeur that you would expect from a royal palace.  It is still a good place to visit to understand the historical way of life of the monarch during that time.  Check out the free tour time table to ensure that you do not wait too long."
1509,3.0,"we went there with my husband during summer time.i wouldnt recommend going there summer time as it is super hot,dry and humid. You'll be walking so much. I love seeing the palace and walk around but i wish they had more stuff inside the big palace for us to see and we could go inside. But this place is a must! Just go one time."
1510,4.0,"Our First tour of Korea is the visit of the Gyeongbokgung Palace. This historic palace was once the home of the Kings has several small palaces scattered in a large area and secured by high fortresses. Our Tour Specialist, Kris, of This is KOREA, told us that the main palace was destroyed by fire and was rebuilt to its original grandeur. The interiors made of big planks of hard wood of the main palace is very simple but the roofs have very intricate carvings and paintings. I'm fascinated with the in-house heating system located beneath the palace floors. They burn wood to create fire that will provide the heat. Don't miss also the Queen's garden located at the back of the Queen's quarters.  The palace is located with a picturesque landscape. There's a mountain at the back and the moat around one of its palaces add to its beauty.  If you're lucky (just like us) you can witness the exchange of guards ceremony held during the specific time of the day. It was almost lunchtime when we saw this ceremony. You can take pictures with the guards after the ceremony.  Near the palace is the presidential mansion of Korea. Also called the ""Blue house"" because of the color of its roof. You are just permitted to a certain area where you can take pictures. The mansion is highly guarded.  The Palace has enough space for parking small vehicles. However, I saw Tourist Buses parked outside along the side street. There's also money changer inside the premises beside the Ticket station."
1511,4.0,"It is autumn season when i visited, lot of beautiful leaf and plant.. breath taking garden and building.  Tips: It will be free entry if you are wearing Hanbok. So dont be shy, try to wear Hanbok and visit this place. it will be a lot more interesting."
1512,4.0,"I think 95% tourists visiting Korea will go to this place! The palace is very beautiful and it's really close to another attractions such as Gwanghwamun Square, Insadong, Bukchon Hanok Village etc.  Make sure you check the ceremony schedule for royal guard changing in front of this palace, it's really exciting to see tho."
1513,5.0,I love this place . Tuesday are off so better come other day . Entry fee is 3000 KRW. Amazing palace I like the environment here surround by tree and u can see the magpie and squirrel. U can rent the hanbok there and take pic .
1514,4.0,"So much fun, what a great piece of history! Do the guided tour to learn more about the culture and how Korea became. There is also a area where you can dress up as a guard right when you walk in on the left... Must do!! Find the falic garden.... Great place for pictures!"
1515,5.0,"+ easily reachable by subway within 1-2 minutes walk + even though there were lots of tourists bus loads of them, it felt quite uncrowded inside the palace due to it being huge"
1516,5.0,"This is one of the most famous palace in Seoul that played important roles during the era of the Korean royalty.  There are so many activities to be done here. One can enjoy the stroll along the well cared and manicured gardens or appreciate the history and beautiful Korean architecture. There is also a children and folk museum that displays exhibits relating to the Korean traditional folk culture. My husband and I visited during the autumn season and the whole complex looked stunningly beautiful. There were also not that many people when we visited during the weekdays and slightly later in the afternoon.  Do not miss the colourful guards changing ceremony prior to entering the complex. You can check the palace's website on the processions timetable. There are also English guided tours conducted daily which are worth joining. You can enquire about these tours when buying the entrance ticket.  Overall, this place is a must visit for anyone who visits Seoul and I recommend it for everyone."
1517,5.0,"This palace was huge and amazing. The buildings had such intricate detail to them. I have never seen anything like this before. [This was my first and only trip to Korea, and Asia for that matter, as well.] The palace was built in the year 1395, and apparently was fully restored in 2010. You will not believe how intricate the details are on the walls and ceilings - it rivals anything I have seen anywhere. If you go to Seoul, this palace is a must-see."
1518,4.0,"Viewed the change of guard ceremony twice. Many peole wear Hanbok in the palace. They are very friendly & allow tourist to take photo with them. After the entrance, at the left entrance, there is free guard dress service for tourist to try on. 4 types of garment to choose from."
1519,4.0,The changing of the guard ceremony is three times per day and about 15 minutes long. It is an impressive sight of color and music. We enjoyed it. To enter the second gate to the palace you need to buy tickets. It is beautiful and quite large. It could easily take an hour + to see it all.
1520,4.0,"Recommended for visiting ,know more about Korean culture and history ,spend times to walk and see each beautiful building"
1521,4.0,"I've been to this palace twice--first time was in October 2012 and the second time was just recently, October 2015. I didn't enter the palace ground anymore on my second trip because it's going to be the same. I just wanted to see the ""Changing of the Guards Ceremony"" again. This time, at around 4PM. The ceremony I witness before was the one in the morning--the complete/full version. Although the one in the afternoon was much shorter, it didn't really take away from the experience of seeing these men all dressed up in their soldier/warrior attires. If you've been to the inner palace once, you don't really have to spend money on another ticket to see it again. It still the same palace building and, architecturally, looks very similar to the other palaces. Most definitely a good place to visit for first-timers in Seoul. A good stop the second time around; however, I don't see myself going back here on my third trip to Korea. I'm giving it a 4 out of 5,nonetheless. Still a very beautiful place to view."
1522,5.0,"Spent couple of hours here, enjoys the historical architecture, ambience, dressing up with old costume.  I have a good times here and liking the army performance. Ensure you comes with a pair of walking shoe, sitting under the trees, enjoys the fall season."
1523,3.0,"A vast area with a lot of very pretty but closed buildings. There were some you could look into, but most of the buildings seemed like empty shells. Very beautiful buildings though. Not many places to get something to eat, and not really much to see. Maybe a guided tour would have been more informative, but I really loathe guided tours - so that's not an option for me. It didn't feel like totally wasted time, but I will never visit again."
1524,4.0,"We visit 3 palace in seoul during our trip, I found this palace is worth to go. Direction: stop at Gyeongbokgung station (line 3) exit 5 Admission 9am-7pm weekend; 9am-6pm weekday (closed on TUESDAY) Ticket: KRW3,000 for adult or combine ticket KRW10,000 (Free entry for those who wear Korean costume) There are free guided tour in English/ Chinese/ Korean/ Japanese you can check the time on their website Free Gate Guard costume experience starting from: 10.15am, 11:10am, 13.15pm, 14.10pm, 15.10pm, 16.10pm Guard changing Ceremony at 11am, I am not sure about other timing. (if you don't feel like going into the palace you can still watch the guard changing ceremony that is free at the main gate before the ticketing counter. Try to go earlier before it get too crowded."
1525,4.0,Palace is gorgeous to see at night. Beautiful reflection of the palace from the lagoon that will give double effect which is very picturesque.
1526,2.0,The palace grounds is on a large piece of land in the middle of town but the buildings were rather disappointing. They looked to be refurbished in a rather rough way although the main building had an interesting ceiling and roof. We were there during the changing of the guards which was an interesting cultural experience but it does not enough to make a visit there worth while unless you really have spare time on your hands.
1527,3.0,This spot is accessible to public by Metro and it is at the Seoul city center where major activities take place just opposite of it. Oct 9 street performance and may art activities make the surrounding lively. One who visit Seoul the first time should not miss this tourist spot.
1528,5.0,If you had to pick just one palace to visit in Seoul this should be it. It is a wonderful place with grand sweeping views. At night (while closed) the front is lit up wonderfully and perfect for night photography. If you're going during the day do so by noon and avoid the weekends if possible because of the crowds.
1529,5.0,This is a fantastic place to visit on your first trip to Korea. You can see how royalty lived in ancient times. This is one of the most well known palaces along with Changdeokgung. There were 5 royal palaces during the Joseon Dynasty. There is a museum that shares the same location as the palace. It would be best to visit the museum first. When you exit the museum you can purchase a ticket booklet that will allow you to go to all 5 of the royal palaces and a nearby shrine.
1530,3.0,"It fell a bit short of my expectation - unlike the palaces in Europe where you get to see the interior. But if you appreciate architecture, this palace won't fail you! The gardens of this palace was gorgeous though, maybe except for the Empress' garden. It looked unkempt. Free guided tours in few foreign languages are available throughout the day which is great. Our guide was cute :)"
1531,5.0,I like Gyeongbokgung Palace the best of all the palaces in Seoul because it has the most history and it is the original (and first) palace of the Joeson Dynasty. There is a very good free English Tour that starts @ 11am every day (subject to change) (and 2 more in the afternoon) and I like that it is where the King lived most of the time and met with his military and civilian leaders there.
1532,4.0,"Living 5mn away, I went multiple times there, during snowy winter, chilly fall, warm summer and beautiful spring. Year around, the place is nice. Don't expect to see anything similar to Forbidden city in Beijing, this is different, this is much smaller, but very enjoyable. Do the Folks Museum, this is very under rated, and quite nice to learn about Korea. I enjoyed nearby the Queen Palace very much, best in WINTER to see the white landscape. Enjoy your time there and forget/relax from the busy city around."
1533,4.0,"This is one of five grand palaces in Seoul. You have the option to purchase the tickets by the entrance. There's a package that cost 10,000 won for admission to all 5 palaces including the secret garden. If you generally want to visit Gyeongbokgung, then it cost 3,000 won for an adult ticket. This place is open everyday from 9am to 5/6pm depending on the time of year and closed on Tuesdays. You can join a tour and follow a tour guide through the palace or you can simply roam freely."
1534,4.0,"There is a small fee to get into the palace complex but it's well worth the money. We were lucky enough to arrive just before the changing of the guard. It is worth watching this exercise, both very colourful (Costumes and flags) and very precise, which takes around 5 minutes to complete. It attracts the crowds every hour on the hour. From the large esplanade, you proceed to a collection of buildings, one after the other. it was the largest of Seoul's palaces and built during the Joseon dynasty and where their history unfolded over the next 500 years. Allow a couple of hours for your visit."
1535,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung is a must-see for a visit to Seoul. The palace is rather large and has a couple of museums as well as an area for children. Depending on your level of interest and how long you spend walking around, you can easily spend an afternoon there."
1536,4.0,"My parents and i visited this Palace on the last Wednesday of the month and entrance fee was waived! We also enjoyed free traditional music performance at the National Palace Museum (which was also free entrance) and had an interesting time at the Folk Museum within the compound (which was also free entrance). You can easily spend a whole afternoon here if you enjoy photography of outdoor architecture and korean culture, or if the weather is good. I visited in September when the weather was turning from hot (with occasional rain) to cool (with sunny days) so if I could visit again I would prefer to go in early Oct. The palace is more beautiful than Deoksugung and much larger as well. You should also visit Jongmyo Shrine for a complete historical learning experience. Wear comfortable shoes (some of the paths are uneven and difficult to walk on); advisable to visit the toilet when you come across one as you are exploring the palace grounds, because toilets are not very conveniently located (only 2, one at the entrance and one at the exit, as well as at the 2 co-located museums which have cleaner toilets). You may wish to bring along a bottle of drinking water; if you need a refill, there are free drinking water fountains within the compound near the toilets and even in resting areas."
1537,5.0,"The palace is renovated and offers a glimpse into the life of the royal family in the old days. The guard ceremony is spectacular and worth the while. For those who purchase tickets you get free guided tours at 11, 13:30 and 3pm in english. Highly recommended"
1538,4.0,"The palace is set on beautiful grounds, with some water and old trees. The colors of the buildings are beautiful, and you're able to peek inside the buildings. There is a map that tells you about each place."
1539,4.0,"We had a nice visit here - got there just in time for the ceremonial changing of the guards which was fun to see. (Happens a few times a day out front). The palace area is quite similar to the Forbidden Palace, lots of hallow structures with open space - wear comfy shoes! At the back there's a very nice garden. In addition, your ticket gets you free entry to the Folk Museum, so hold on to your ticket!"
1540,4.0,Nice museum and beautiful palace grounds! Reminiscent of the forbidden city in Beijing. Good for a half day adventure!
1541,4.0,"A very nice place! It reminds of the Forbidden City in Beijing, China. But this place has a much more beautiful architecture."
1542,5.0,"This place is expansive! I had imagined it would be one or two buildings, but it's practically a town in an of itself. And inside each room, the details are incredible!  The entrance is off of a downtown hub, so it's quite a transformation going from tall, modern city buildings to ancient walls, bricks, and tile. The part that I found most interesting was that looking north you only saw history with a mountain as your backdrop. You could get lost in time, but if you turned around it was so striking to see the juxtaposition of towering urban buildings just beyond ancient wall."
1543,5.0,If you are in Seoul its a must see. I suggest doing a palace tour day which might include a stop in Insadong. Take the subway as its cheap and easy to navigate.
1544,3.0,"Gyeongbokgung is a huge palace in the city center. I took subway there. Unfortunately I cannot wait for the guided tour so I just look around, quite not fun and uninformed. There is a photo spot for you who want to wear palace guide uniform. They also have the Guard Ceremony several times a day which is, for me, is the highlight of this place.  Suggestion: make sure you come in the right time for guided tour (depends on your language) because it makes huge difference for your visit. Moreover, the museum next to the palace is said to be good but unfortunately I did not have the chance to visit."
1545,4.0,"The Gyeongbok Palace show us the respect and importance Koreans gave to their King, the palace had lots of space combined in elegance and grandure, the rite of Changing the Guards was equally a sight to see.. It showed us the discipline instilled among Koreans.. But i really admired the spacious grounds that made up for the beauty of the place.."
1546,5.0,"Have been twice to Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's a very cheap attraction--around 3 dollars. You can easily spend over an hour exploring the palace and the grounds. Definitely a great place for photos.  It's very refreshing to spend time here away from the hustle and bustle of Seoul. This is easily on my ""must do"" list for Seoul every time I come to the city."
1547,4.0,"The Palace (in the centre of Seoul) is huge and worth doing with a guide, if you can. It's a replica, as previous versions were destroyed during the many invasions. As previously mentioned by another reviewer, the rooms within each building can become repetitive without the benefit of a guide explaining the rooms and how they were used.  Still, it's worth seeing checking out some of the rooms and then watching the changing of the guards in traditional Korean attire. There's a museum deep inside the grounds of the Palace, which offer a great reprieve from the humidity on a hot day."
1548,5.0,Definitely a must see attraction if you've travelled once in Seoul. Combines the harmony of nature and the orientalist architecture. Take your time to walk around. Sit down at the pond and relax.
1549,3.0,The palace is big but nothing much to see except building structure. Almost nothing to see in the palace as well. Perhaps a guide tag along to explain the historical would be better
1550,2.0,"The grounds are well maintained and extensive, you can spend hours walking around and exploring. As we were walking through, we were trying to read up on the history and find out a little more. My impressions were just that everything was very bare...although it was a nice quiet walk, I found it to be rather uninteresting as a palace. Walls and nothing more but nice scenery."
1551,5.0,Suitable for many types of visitors as it is park-like and relaxing as well as chock full of amazing history. It's a beautiful place that's romantic for couples or interesting for families. Well worth the visit! Anyone going for the first time would benefit by reading up on it's history first.
1552,5.0,"Although its a 1990s reconstruction of the 14th century palace, it is well worth a visit. Very reminiscent of the Forbidden City in Beijing in a better location with mountain views and surrounding parks"
1553,3.0,"It's very neat; however, since the Korean War destroyed nearly all the original buildings, it didn't have the same effects."
1554,5.0,"Just back in time after they completed the hardwork on the main gate. This place was offering me romantic and gigantic at the same time. If you are big fan of Korean series, don't miss this spot."
1555,5.0,"We went there free of charge since there's a summer promotion in July 2015. My first time being in a huge magnificent palace and there were so much to explore! We were there by 1pm and witnessed the royal changing of guard! The guards could stand so still despite the hot weather! We were deeply impressed!  The palace is huge and it requires good stamina and great deal of time if you wanna explore the whole site. Furthermore, it's connected to the National Folks Museum, and there are also small little houses for you to enter! Try to enter all of them, some even provide free photo taking services and you will be surprised! Haha."
1556,5.0,Very similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing in terms of structure and designs. Grand and resplendent. Saw the changing of guards in the morning and beating of the traditional Korean gong. I could have spent a day exploring the grounds. National Folk Museum is located here as well.
1557,5.0,The palace was so clean and the staff are very polite. They have museum as well before we walk ard the whole palace i suggest you can visit the museum.
1558,4.0,This palace is so big and aroubd every corner there is a hidden teasure. It's rich in history and stunning to strole through.  Little kids can run around but will get bored after a little while since there isn't much that will facinate their brains.  If you visit keep in mind that Jul/Aug is Monsoon time so it might start raining whilst you're there. Take an umbrella incase and go enjoy.  You could also have a small picnic there i think.
1559,3.0,"If you've been to other grand imperial palaces, like the Versailles or the Beijing Imperial Palace, this was ok. It was well kept, but it could use more contextual explanations."
1560,5.0,Magnificent palace. Very large grounds. Was free in july when I visited. There is a folk palace on the grounds as well. Good way to learn of Korean history.
1561,4.0,I was so lucky to have the opportunity to visit this palace and also able to joint tour guide inside the palace ground. I was also lucky to watched the Royal Guards Exchanging at 14:00. Of course this take place 3 times per day.  I would recommend anyone that visiting Seoul to come here and take this guided tour. It was a really interesting and educational to learn about the Korean history.
1562,5.0,"The biggest and historically most important of the many palaces in Seoul. Watch a changing of the gate guards and take a guided tour -- much to see and appreciate. Prepare to cringe a few times if you're Japanese -- the history includes some serious unpleasantness, like the occasion when Japan sent 60 guys to assassinate the empress. But you'll still enjoy the tour -- I think! The guides are friendly and knowledgeable. As an American with almost no knowledge of the Korean language, I certainly liked the tour."
1563,4.0,"More than the palace itself, the grounds were beautiful. Since we visited in spring, there were flowers everywhere and the weather was perfect. I would also recommend taking the free tour to get an idea of the palace's history. There is a lot of walking, so make sure to wear comfortable shoes."
1564,4.0,We went with two kids 9&10 and we limited our visit to 1-2 hours max. Really warm (36*C) and afterwards we went to the DDP that was designed by Zaha Hadid. Great contrast to see traditional vs modern. But of course we love modern art...
1565,4.0,"Our family traveled to Seoul in June, 2015, at the height of the MERS scare, so our experience is pretty atypical. That said, even if you didn't have this magnificent palace basically all to yourself, it would definitely be worth a visit. After a quick look around the museum, we headed outside with our tour guide to explore the compound. The buildings are all gorgeous, with colorful painted details and airy, furnished rooms to peek into. The buildings are so large and imposing, it really evokes a sense of grandeur. This is a great place to get a historical perspective on the hyper-modern city of Seoul."
1566,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung is the largest royal palace in Seoul and was the main royal palace for much of the Joseon (Choson) dynasty; that alone may or may not be enough to appeal to potential visitors. There are two really great things to see here, though: the changing of the guard with Joseon dynasty-costumed guards and the National Palace Museum, which is really worth an hour or two, filled as it is with interesting and beautiful art and artifacts. After you see Gyeongbokgung, make sure to see Toksegung (Daeksogung or Duksoo) Palace & the Secret Garden (Piwon) of Changdaekgung Palace as well. But just outside Gyeongbokgung's gate, Gwanghwamun, is a huge plaza with statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sunshin, Korea's two greatest heroes; there's a small museum focusing on them located below the plaza that's worth an hour. And you should go back to Gyeongbokgung at sunset see Gwanghwamun at dusk, when it is at its most beguiling and photogenic."
1567,4.0,"Palaces are always worth visiting, try to plan your visit around the ceremonies that are held to experience the culture."
1568,5.0,"Liked how they keep it looking the way it look over 500 years ago. I liked the English tour, very informative."
1569,5.0,Real great palace that you cannot miss even short time visit in Seoul. Be sure to go on the Secret Garden tour as well. Also walk autside and around this Palace because you can find small but nice places where to eat with really nice local people.
1570,4.0,"Its a very big place.. if you walk alone make sure you have your guide book or internet,so you will know what is the palace all about and you will not lost.. ^^"
1571,4.0,"The Palace had massive grounds. There were many different parts to the different aspects of palatial life in ancient Korea. Be prepared to walk. There was a beautiful pavilion, Gyeonghoru Pavilion, located in the middle of a large pond. Although I couldn't go onto the floating pavilion, I believe you can apply online to go onto the floating pavilion. The palace officials had a list of names who were permitted to enter. At the entrance of the palace, I was fortunate to catch the reenactment of the changing of the palace guards. So, check the performance times so you can make it there. There are also English speaking guides available free of charge to guide you around the palace."
1572,1.0,"Could not get in, all closed up with construction inside. Disappointing although some good traditional Korean restaurants around the area."
1573,3.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is absolutely huge, but after a while all of the buildings start to look very similar. The first part of the palace is the most interesting: Gwanghwamun Gate, the large paved courtyards and the throne room are truly impressive. After the first 3 or 4 buildings I got bored very quickly and found that the rest of the palace consisted of nothing more than empty rooms in near identical buildings. The only features of interest past the initial cluster of buildings were the small lake with the garden island (behind the main palace) and the large pavilion for official entertaining on a large lake to the west of the main section of palace buildings. A lack of clear signage made it hard to find where to go next. I spent an hour and a half wandering around until I lost interest but you could easily spend much more time here if you wanted to. I was a bit disappointed that the palace is largely just empty buildings you can only see from the outside - it is hard to appreciate the rich history of Korea when one buildings looks the same as the one you just saw. Changdeokgung Palace had more character and was much prettier. The Changing of the Guard happens regularly and is a good show, but not as interesting as the one at Deoksugung Palace."
1574,4.0,"Great palace. We bought the booklet ticket to see all 5 palaces plus the Secret Garden & Jomyo Shrine. But after the 3 palace, it just feels like we're revisiting the same place over n over.  Secret garden is great but requires a lot of walking (slopes & steps) continuously for about 1hr. Very beautiful though.  If you don't have a lot of time (or stamina), just pick 2 palaces and maybe the Secret Garden. Check schedules for change of guards.  I recommend Gyeongbokgung & Changdeokgung plus Secret Garden."
1575,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung is SUCH an incredible piece of history-and I totally reccommend taking the English audio tour. I've been there twice now and I really feel that I find something new to admire each time. Plus, the museums on the grounds are very interesting in and of themselves.  Highly recommend bringing some snacks and water and just walking around the grounds in the back of the palace, especially during spring/summer. The view of the mountain is nice and it's very relaxing/peaceful."
1576,5.0,I've been to this palace in all the seasons and like all the palaces in Korea it is best in Autumn. It's easy to get lost here but it doesn't feel like you're in the centre of a city at all. It is so peaceful.
1577,4.0,"Not to be missed. If you are in Seoul, try coming here even if you only have a few hours to spare. Beautiful buildings and architecture.."
1578,4.0,"The whole area where the palace stands is wide and the buildings are quite similar in architecture and design. It is just awesomely handsome. If you have a guide tell her/him not to hurry the tour. You 'll miss some places inside the perimeter if you're in a hurry. Take your time and take pictures as many as you can. Tour guides have the habit of telling the history of the place longer than it may seems eating away your time for an extensive tour of the place. Instead of listening, go your own way for taking photos as fast as your group can but be sure to follow your eyes where your group goes. There's the possibility that you'll loose them because there are plenty of tourists. The history of the place can be gathered from the internet so, don't bother listening to your guide the history of the place. Go, take pictures. It's your only chance."
1579,4.0,"My husband and I had a 12 hour overlay at the ICN airport. This is a great way to spend the time and get a chance to visit Seoul. We signed up for the free 5 hour city tour. Apparently this is the most popular tour of all, I made reservation online (ICN airport website) 6 weeks prior departure and I was lucky I got the last 2 seats. The tour includes a simple Korean lunch which is $10 (mandatory). Transportation/bus is free, courtesy of Korean government. Tour guide is a volunteer and very funny. Nice to walk around the city after a 15 hour flight. The only thing I dislike is the lunch. We were given 2 options: bibimbap (rice) or beef stew. We ordered 1 each, the stew was too sweet to eat for me. Tour was great. I will try other tours next time."
1580,4.0,"The gardens inside the palace are really beautiful, reminded me a little bit the forbidden city because of the roofs. But it truly reflects korean philosophy of respecting an caring nature."
1581,4.0,"Overall, the Palace is well-maintained. It's easy to navigate your way around, even without a map since there are signs leading you where to go next. There are also descriptions of each structure, in English, Chinese, and Japanese, so it's easy to get to know the place even without a tour guide. However, there are also maps available at the information area, but for a fee. Don't forget to wear your rubber shoes since you will be doing a lot of walking. Before you start touring the palace grounds, be sure to catch the changing of the guards ceremony just outside the main palace grounds. Ticket area is also nearby. If you love nature photography, this is a must-go place in Korea, especially in spring and autumn since there are a variety of flowers in the area. Plus, don't forget to have your photos taken in the iconic parts of the compound (the structure with a pond, the rows of traditional houses or building around, the entrance) since these are commonly shown in Korean dramas :). You haven't gone to Korea without those photos! After your tour around the palace, you may also want to visit the museum behind it and also have your photos taken with the other statues/structures outside (i.e. the zodiac characters, the tikis (guards of villages), and traditional houses of commoners). I will never get tired of visiting this palace!"
1582,1.0,"Such great history that sits here. I have heard wonderful stories of this place, and being able to put those stories to comparison of what I have seen is so beautiful. Enjoyed the walk around the culture."
1583,3.0,The palace is decent & all the block looks similar.The palaces are devoid of many rich artwork found normally in palaces( at least not visible form visitors gallery).  Only some chambers have beautiful designs & color work. The layout is same for all palaces in Seoul.  Be prepared to walk a lot
1584,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung is a great place, right in the centre of Seoul where you can spent hours walking, exploring and taking pictures. Make sure you have comfortable shoes. Don't miss the change of guards. Guards are dressed in traditional attire and the ceremony is narrated - it is a great experience. If you arrive right before the ceremony you will see the training beforehand. This is a must when is Seoul."
1585,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung is a great place, right in the centre of Seoul, to spend an hour or so wandering around and taking photos. The halls, pavilions and courtyards are really pretty, and it's an interesting juxtaposition between them and the modern city that surrounds them."
1586,5.0,"This was our first stop on a sight-seeing tour. We arrived just as the changing of the palace guards was taking place which was very nice to see. This is a ceremonial event that takes place twice per day. Guards are dressed in traditional attire and the ceremony is narrated through a public address system in different languages including English. This is an expansive property and a lot of walking should be expected (including some stairs which are fairly steep). Palace dates back to the 13th century and has been well maintained (and restored numerous times over the decades). The palace includes 4 gates and a number of buildings. At the far end of the palace, (and across the street) is the ""Blue House"" which is the current residence and government buildings of the Republic of Korea. This is an excellent attraction and would recommend visit by tour guide for explanation of the history of the palace. This attraction can be done over several hours or a full day could be spent here. Definitely a must see in South Korea."
1587,4.0,"Glorious palace surrounded by a mirroring lake in a beautiful garden, this is what it is. Everything is so pristinely clean. Would not mind going back."
1588,3.0,Easy to get around and the actors and costumes were a nice surprise addition to our visit. (These are not the original buildings but cool to imagine them as if they were.)
1589,5.0,"look to your left and you see a skyline of skyscrapers, look to your right and you see an ancient palace. We were luck to catch the changing of guards ceremony at 10am. We also had a free walking tour (you can book this on Korea tourism sites) he showed us all the different parts to the palace and explained the history to us for nearly 3 hours! We walked from our hotel in City Hall to the Palace and it took 20mins- very centrally located. Also theres a station right outside if you need it"
1590,5.0,"If you love to visit castles , you would love it.  Very huge area to cover, hence get ready to spend 5 hours if you visit it completely. Other than structure , you may enjoy festivals there (if they are scheduled), museum is also next to it which is very well maintained.  Points to be noted : 1) Not a fun for young children 2) Have good energy to walk for long distances 3) Combo ticket is available for all palaces but if you are visiting this one only , specify while purchasing 4) Good cafes in museum 5) Do not miss traditional parade"
1591,4.0,"I had a long layover at ICN, so took the train and a cab over to see the palace and surrounding neighborhood. It will take about 5 to 6 hours to do this including train time.  The first thing to understand is that this palace has been burned down (not completely) and re-built over history. Many if not most of the structures are faithful recreations of earlier versions.  The layout of the grounds is remarkably similare to the Forbidden City in Beijing if you have been there, reflecting similar culture and heirarchy.  With that pre-amble, I had a great visit and would recommend this as a worthwhile excursion. Between the palace grounds and the adjacent folk museum (which is free) I learned a great deal about Korean culture and history.  Across the street, there are two art museums and a wonderful walking neighborhood with a number of quick restaurants."
1592,5.0,"If you visit only one temple this should be it. It's part of a larger complex but this was the center of power in its day. Here you see how the royal family lived and discover the power of the King's mother. She chose the next King. We were there to see a procession of the King and his entourage walk down the path from the temple to the gate. The King approaches in a sedan chair carried by eight husky men and then alights and strolls with the group for a short distance. Everyone is in red. This event is held periodically, so visitors should check with a guard to find the schedule."
1593,4.0,I come here with my parents in winter season have a lot of tours.here have good view for take a photo with couples and family.
1594,5.0,Try to go at 1pm to experience the changing of the gate warriors - so colourful! Took an English speaking tour which was very informative.
1595,4.0,"Interesting, but arrive early to avoid the heat. The changing of guards was interesting. However the sand at the forecourts was uncomfortable when the wind blows."
1596,4.0,"it reminded me of the Forbidden city in Beijing, just amazing, big in scale. it takes some work walking around it, lots of stairs. to really understand the history some additional background might be helpful, a tour book, or printed content from internet research. the gardens around it were nice too, especially since we visited in the Spring, during the flower bloom season."
1597,5.0,Must watch the changing of Guard...superb experience...10 am everyday except Tuesday...close on Tuesday...walk the huge ground and do not forget the garden around the perimeter....
1598,5.0,One of the places worth a visit if you want to know the history of Korea. The tour guide is very good in speaking English.
1599,5.0,"The way the emperors lives was pretty cool. Take the walking tour, it is very helpful. Lots of stairs and walking but it is very beautiful, The guards do not move, just like the UK."
1600,5.0,"If there is one place that you can visit when in a long over in Seoul... Its Gyeongbokgung Palace. My daughter and I took the ARES train to Seoul Station and just follow the train map we downloaded to find the next train going to the palace. When we were there, its was a free entrance day too. Not much tourist so we got to take awesome pics.  We did not stay too long, but was able to see the Changing of the Guard and went inside for some pics. No complains, its enough to feel the Korean soul.  Don't miss going to Gyeongbokgung Palace!"
1601,4.0,"we got to watch the changing of the guard at 10 am . there are some rooms you can enter, which is unusual in these palaces. also, there are some gardens and a beautiful pond area."
1602,2.0,"Kinda waste of time and money for visit.. probably i duno how to appreciate wide ""empty"" palace. Simply nothing for me to see. Less than 10mins, am outta of this place"
1603,5.0,If you would want to see only one Palace. This is the place to go. I have seen the Changdeokgung Palace but still prefer this one. Bigger and more attractions. Only downside side is the Chinese hordes of tourist who push and shove and it is hard to get a photo with the family with a lot of photo bombs. Very easy to get to by subway.
1604,4.0,"My friends and I were lucky that we arrived just when the changing of guards ceremony was about to start. The ceremony was impressive, though it was pretty funny how the guards had way too obvious fake beards. The free tour was really good, very informative."
1605,5.0,"The buildings are superb .The gardens are outstanding, and although there are lots of tourists there is plenty of areas of peace and quiet to be able to contemplate the serenity of the Palace"
1606,5.0,"We visited this palace as part of a group tour. The changing of the guard occurs daily at 10:00, 13:00; and 15:00 (**double check these times before going as they may change!!) Huge crowd at the 10:00 ceremony but still able to see and enjoy the program. There are numerous ""outbuildings"" scattered throughout the grounds. You can probably cover everything in an hour. Also, the ""Folk Museum"" is co-located with the palace and admission was included with admission to the palace grounds. The museum has a decent sized collection and is definitely worth seeing. It can be accessed once inside the palace complex (as well as from the street). Plan for a good 2.5 hours total to see both the palace and the museum; 3 hours if you want to soak in the museum exhibits."
1607,3.0,The palace was worth for visit to understand the emperor history of Seoul. The building design reflected the emperor living style.
1608,5.0,"For the equivalent of US$3.00, you get to view a restored palace district that is spectacular. From palaces, to summer houses to lakes and gardens - this is a refreshing change from the modernity of Seoul. I had taken 100 photos before I knew it. It is an absolute must on any Seoul itinerary!"
1609,4.0,Just a walking distance from King Sejong and General Yi Sun Shin statue. The place are massive and really enjoyed the ambiance. Just 3000 for the entrance fee and it worth to visit.
1610,5.0,"First time visiting a palace. Amazing view, the palace was so big. We checked out the king and queen staying area. There is one house that was like in the middle of a small pond or something. Many people there, talk to some local school kids also on school trip. The scenery is super nice as theres mountains and trees (I went during the spring time). Great Visit, will be visiting again. Got many photos and videos there. Youtube - lolsia2000"
1611,5.0,"If you visit Seoul, you can see the King's palace, Gyeongbokgung Palace. It is located near the city governent centers. Walk slowly just like a queen(or a King) and feel the calm beauty. See the beautiful curve lines of the Korean traditional roof tiles.  If you should visit just one place because of the short time, just go and see the real unique beauty of the old treasure."
1612,5.0,"Everyone who goes to Korea must visit Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's right at the heart of Seoul and the current city government centers are still around the area.  The 3 pillar entrance and animal statues that ""guard"" the Palace offer a starting tease at what lies inside. Once you enter the complex, the intricate ancient walls, wide spaces, and stone paths all draw your attention to magnificent palace buildings where the monarch of Korea used to hold office and receive guests. The best building to see is the banquet hall. It lies on top of a pristine pond and with mountains at the backdrop. Truly spectacular!  Make sure to bring comfortable shoes since you will definitely want to walk around. A camera is a must to capture the beauty of the place. It can get sunny so bring sunblock/moisturiser if you want. My family went there on a weekend it was really full of people. Try to visit on a weekday perhaps so there are less tourists. We spent around 1 hour going around but it wasn't enough for me. I think you should spend at least 1 hour and 30 mins - 2 hours or so. Other attractions are close to the area such as the National Museum, Blue House, and the Cheonggyecheon stream."
1613,5.0,"This place is so amazing for a history lovers, tourists or even if you want to spend some time close to the nature. The scenery is great! The organization inside and outside the palace is good! I really enjoyed. They even have some self-managed mini-cars (looked alike the ones for golf) for the elderly people. That is so cool! So everyone can go to the place and have fun!"
1614,5.0,"It is huge and wonderful. The best time to visit is in May, because they open it at night, and there will be Royal Court Festival, so you feel like really thrown back into Joseon dynasty. And the have free tours in English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, so you better check the time. Otherwise it would be difficult to know which building was what. If you missed the tour, I suggest to buy the handbook for only $0,5."
1615,4.0,"Visited the palace twice over the past few years. it's the largest of all the palaces in Korea, and where some well-known dramas get their locations filmed.  Nice walk with a pretty view."
1616,5.0,Was a fun place to walk around and look at the housing that the king lived in . There is a museum on site as well that is worth walking thru!
1617,5.0,"My first visit was after 3.00 pm. I entered from Sinmumun Gate and couldn't cover the whole area of the palace. By 5.00 pm, I only managed to visit the northern part of the palace and the National Folk Museum ( a very quick walk inside, and grabbed a cup of latte at the cafe).  It's just amazing that beautiful palaces like Gyeongbok and Changdeok are right the middle of this huge metropolitan city. Upon entering, I felt like I was walking into a different era.  My next visit was in the morning a few days after my first visit, and I entered from Gwanghamun gate. The majestic palace, the gates, the whole area, the landscape were just breathtaking.The garden, the architecture of the pavillions - you'll have to go there yourself to see how beautiful the palace and its area are. I hope you will find a time to visit this place if you plan to go to Seoul and be ready to fall in love with this palace."
1618,4.0,"A ""must do"" while in Seoul. If you're really into history you could easily spend hours here, but you can also breeze right through and snap a couple pictures. Very affordable."
1619,2.0,Nothing much interesting to view at palace. too touristy place. don't really feel the culture when stepped inside.
1620,5.0,"(Pro-tip ~ all cultural attractions are free every last Wednesday of the month in Korea!). I highly recommend spending a good hour or two here, getting lost in the beautiful, intricate architecture and painted eaves. There are some informative plaques scattered about, and the 500 won guidebook is very interesting."
1621,4.0,"Nice clean grounds and some beautiful buildings. Palace is well kept. Very busy, long queue to get tickets."
1622,4.0,Were lucky and got a personal guidance by a guide trainee. Made us stay much longer then planned but well worth the extra time. Had to skip the Secret garden but will come back soon.
1623,5.0,So many school kids were there when we went so it was packed along with the tourists. Very interesting but remember that this is not the original which burned down.
1624,5.0,"We were lucky to be there to see the changing of the Guard although I believe it happens hourly. Beautifully kept, a really stunning place with gardens teeming with cherry blossoms in springtime . An absolute delight!"
1625,4.0,"Time your visit to coincide with the changing of the guard, Korean style and the English language guided tour. At the end went to Korean folklore museum which is at the far end and was a nice ending."
1626,5.0,"You can easily spend a few hours roaming through the buildings. Very impressive, especially the maze of walls, courts and small buildings in the northern part of the complex. Free entrance to National Folk Museum is a bonus. And all for a mere 3$."
1627,5.0,"Make sure that you arrive before 10.00 am. ( 1.00 pm / 3.00 pm ). That's when the Changing of the Guards takes place. Try to bag a vantage point near the big drum ( near the ticket kiosks ). This is where the guards will enter the palace grounds. This is no ordinary changing of the guards. It is a vista in Korean traditional military uniform, traditional instruments, traditional weapons and flags. Plus the whole pomp and ceremony of it all. Note: You can watch the arrival of the relieving guards or you can position yourself in front of Gwunghwamun to witness the end of the ceremony. Then you can wander around the inner palace, after which you can opt for a free guided tour ( English ) at 11.00 am. After this, if you still have the energy, the Palace Museum is just next door and definitely worth a visit. ( Look out for the royal placenta jars !)"
1628,2.0,"Really not much to see, except the changing of the guards ceremony. Should have English explanation of each area and building of the palace. The ground was dry and not much shrubs or flowers. I have been here a few times and it is about the same. A disappointment."
1629,5.0,This palace has so many story i heard. This is not huge mega palace but you can read it what is the palace.
1630,5.0,"I guess if you are in Seoul you will almost certainly go to this famous palace complex. It is apparently the biggest and seems to be the busiest and most popular with tourists and Koreans alike. There is also a regular 'changing of the guard' ceremony, which is fun. Entrance to the enclosure is primarily from the south west or south east, although the ticket office is at the south east. Entrance is cheap (free for 65 year old or over) and an excellent English (or other language) small guide book will cost you just 500 Won. The extent of restoration testifies to the turbulent history of Korea but the extensive site and many buildings are well worth a visit and will keep keen photographers busy. Access to the National Palace Museum is at the south west and the National Folk Museum is at the north east (you get your hand stamped if you want to visit the museum and re-enter the palace). One of the 'essential' sights!"
1631,5.0,"I came here just thinking to take some photos and have a look around. C'mon, what much can you see in a castle compound? Wrong. There's a lot to see here. And plus, the place is so huge and buildings are placed quite far apart, so there were lots of walking. Ended up I spent about 4 hours, barely covering the few main buildings and the garden with the lake in the middle. Lots of photospots, either the Maingate, guards, main courtyard, inner gate and the list goes on.. it just never ends. I went on a warm and bright autumn day, so it was good. All the time spent here will be outdoor, so if you're going in the winter of in the colder days of spring and autumn, then better be prepared."
1632,5.0,"This, I think, is the best and most well-known palace in Seoul. Changing of the Guard is cool here. Photo ops are awesome, to include the background of the 10,000 won bill."
1633,5.0,"The main palace in the Joseon Dynasty! Be sure to visit all places within the complex!  If you are lucky, come around 1300hrs for guard changing ceremony. It is one of the three times daily they change the guards."
1634,4.0,"We arrived rather early and could tour the palace and ground before having a free guided tour in English. Both approaches helped us to get an extensive view of that central monument in the history of (not so) ancient Korea. If you can, do not miss the changing of the guard!"
1635,4.0,We visited the palace and found ourselves walking around the place to view the many interesting architectural details and design. We spent about 75 minutes walking around until the rain pushed us onward to our next tour. Worth the visit.
1636,4.0,"We planned to join an English speaking tour (two or three are conducted during the week and note that the Palace is closed on Tuesday's) This is the only way to see the grounds, to enjoy its splendor and beauty. The tour was a quick one hour, but sufficient to give one a firm overview of the palace and history. It is the largest palace in Seoul and if you can only see one, then this is the one to see. Also adjacent to the palace is the Korean Folk Museum and there are other sites nearby. We went on a Saturday so it was crowded, but not overly so."
1637,5.0,"If you are into political and historical sites, i recommend to see this place. It will bring back how the culture was formed and shaped years ago."
1638,4.0,"Headed here on an organised tour. The palace is huge while you could happily wander through here alone although a tour guide adds so much more to the history and way the place was constructed and operates, I would recommend it.  The changing of the gate guard ceremony is at 10am, worthwhile seeing, lots of flags music and colors. The palace gets a bit crowded after this time as all the tour groups start to go through. It wasn't that crowded though.  We visited, at the end of March, the cherry blossoms were starting to come out, though will in full bloom in a week or two  Defiantly worth seeing."
1639,4.0,This Palace was so much larger than expected. Saturdays you can see changing of the guards in traditional Korean uniforms from Joseon Dynasty Period. For cost of admission (1.50 US) you get access to Palace Museum. This is a primarily outdoor walk through of the grounds- be prepared to walk quite a bit but plenty of areas to rest. Beautiful parklike setting in center and Folk Museum close enough to visit as well (separate admission).
1640,4.0,Definitely recommend getting the guide book and really taking your time to read about the incredible stories and history of each hall/temple. And see the changing of the guards - very cool fashion statements!
1641,4.0,"Gyeongbok Palcae is the rebuilt (circa late 1800s) palace of one of Korea's kings prior to Japan's first invasion of the country. It is large, with a variety of buildings from the homes of the queen and the crown prince, to the dwellings of lesser staff and a government work building. It isa good look at Korean history and a remembrance of the Japanese war atrocities that required the reconstruction of buildings like this throughout Korea."
1642,5.0,"If you're going to see any of the many palaces in Seoul, I would recommend this one - only because it's the biggest, most popular, easily located, and around a lot of other landmarks/monuments. Honestly, if you've seen one of the palaces, you've seen them all. Nonetheless, it's a worthwhile visit."
1643,4.0,"We had joined a free guided tour in English. All very well organised. It was a very crowded day as it was the last Wednesday of the month and entrance was free for that day. Beautiful grounds, historical and very Korean. Be on time for the changing of the guards."
1644,5.0,"A definite MUST for all Seoul travellers. Wonderful views into Korean history and mindset. Kids love it, adults love it... what's not to love? Palace area is accessible even with wheelchairs and prams so everyone is available (though there are some steps)."
1645,4.0,A lot of things to see and visit. Be prepared to do a lot of walking because the grounds are very vast. Our kids were interested in the first few buildings but after seeing the rest they were bored. We ended up letting them run around in the open fields outside to tire them out. The palace is well intact and gives you a good idea of how life was back then. Definitely recommend seeing the palace if you're visiting.
1646,5.0,Beautiful place! Easy to get there. Have some information in English too. Impressive buildings and vivid very artistic decorations.
1647,5.0,"Due to the history with Japan, much of this does not date back to the 1300's but instead the 18/1900's. Regardless it is very cheap to tour and the grounds are beautiful/massive. Worth the 2-3 hours to do it justice. Try to catch the changing of the guards."
1648,4.0,"It was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty. Today, it is the most beautiful and grandest palace of all. Must see during visit to South Korea."
1649,4.0,"If you're a tourist visiting Seoul, the palaces are a go to attraction. I was only able to visit one palace and I was glad it was this one. The place is also next to a museum which would make it convenient for people who are interested in history. This place is huge! Their is a lot of walking involved. If you're there at the right time, you can also view a changing of the guard ceremony at the main entrance."
1650,3.0,It's a must-go spot for tourists and that means you have to share the beautiful palace with thousands of people. It is really an astounding structure of building and the lake and trees are pretty as well.
1651,4.0,"Many palace has been greatly preserved. This palace on the other hand has been abandoned, damaged and destroyed systematically. Currently, many of the building within the palace is planned to be restored to original condition. The palace is very popular with tourist so it is quite crowded but the garden area is quiet. The palace have north and south entrance gate. North Gate also shows the current President' s building."
1652,3.0,"If you read my other reviews on the palaces in Korea, then you will know that it is a good first step if you have never visited other Asian palaces in Japan or China. If you have, you may feel disappointed because Korean palaces lacks the grandeur of their Asian neighbours. I never got the ""awe"" factor."
1653,4.0,Tours in English run at set times. Definitely worth doing it as there isn't much signage and what would seem like a whole bunch of buildings would be unappreciated without the history and stories.  Not ideal destination in the rain as there's not much shelter.
1654,5.0,Absolutely breathtaking with the presidential palace in the background of the south gate. The palace is a lot less crowded at the south gate which is quite nice. During the new year there were tons of extra activities going on within the gates with many people in traditional dress. The foliage isn't in bloom but it was not too crowded so traveling here in the wintertime definitely has its bonuses.
1655,5.0,"Fantastic palace; This place is very similar to the forbidden city in Beijing, it goes on and on, with each section opening new insights into the life of its inhabitants. Great architectural detail, and perfect place for some great photos."
1656,4.0,"Period attire along with very well preserved site signage in Korean and english, Tour guides are there to help and explain"
1657,5.0,"My 3rd time visiting this famous palace. I never get tired of coming here as there are so many areas to see and explore. Be there early as by late morning, hoards of tour buses arrived and it really didn't help that the tourists who arrived in bus crowds were all talking or shouting at their loudest. If with friends, can arrange a picnic and enjoy a splendid time exploring the palace. It is especially beautiful during the spring or autumm season. totally recommended."
1658,5.0,"This is easily accessible and full of culture. During the changing of the guards and on special days it can be crowded, but at other times it is peaceful.  (I visited around 2012, but the questionnaire doesn't allow for dates from that long ago.)"
1659,4.0,"I had a good time at Gyeongbokgung, but I had my camera with me and was having fun shooting flowers and birds and walking through the museums. The changing of the guards was a fun experience too, and there were some groups of younger folks playing some old traditional music as well. But I don't know that it would hold the attention of the young un's very long. the monument itself is a real short visit and the rest is walking around the grounds, so I think it just needs to be your cup of tea. It's in a good area to branch out and do other things too. Don't miss the little statues on all the corners and pedestals around the palace, I found them particularly intricate and interesting."
1660,5.0,I loved visiting here. It's directly off the Myeongdong/Dongdaemun subway--very easy to get to. It's also very cheap to visit. I had a great time walking around the temples here.
1661,4.0,I went alone exploring Gyeongbokgung Palace because I want to see the changing of the guards. So I went around lunchtime and waited an hour. There's not much to see unlike the other bigger palaces so I sat and read for a while. The place is rather peaceful and there was less tour groups.
1662,4.0,"If you a DiY, the palace is within walking distance from Insadong across the boulevard. The palace ground is humongus and you will need good pair of walking shoes. Though less comparable with the great palaces of Beijing, Tokyo and Osaka, nevertheless they have much to offer in terms of the nation's history.  Toilets are not abound so make you attend to your needs before wandering around. I love the ornate roofs and the well preserve timber frames but again will not be drawn into comparison with the Forbidden City of Beijing.  The other dampener you will face is this place seems to be a must visit for every tourist to Seoul. The result is this could get overcrowding including the q for the women's toilets. I did not see the changing of the guards as we were on a free transit tour but that would be somewhat colourful as with when they are filming costume/period Korean dramas."
1663,4.0,"The place is huge, but of course not China's Forbidden City's huge.  This is the place where you'll have a glimpse of what the Emperors of Korea used to lived.  Great place for photographs.  You'll find people dressed in the traditional korean outfits outside of the maingate.  Easily accessible via Subway."
1664,5.0,"I visited this Palace in late November 2014 after a day exploring Seoul at the end of a Korean business trip... Entrance fee is very cheap at KWon 3,000 (about GB£1.80) and there is plenty to see.  The imposing Southern Gate ('Gwanghwamun') is a major Seoul landmark and over the years has been destroyed and rebuilt several times. The current gate was unveiled in 2010 after a 4 year reconstruction project!! Once through the gate you enter the Front Courtyard where you purchase your Palace entry tickets and there is often some form of traditional music and dance taking place.  From the Front Courtyard you climb some steps and enter into the Palace complex where you see the huge two-tiered former throne room 'Geunjeongjeon Hall'... Look for the beautiful folding screen behind the wooden Joseon throne. From here, going North, you will see the 'Gangnyeongjeon Hall' which dates back to 1395 (reconstructed in 1995) which used to be the bed chamber of Joseon Kings.  For me though the best part of my visit was the beautiful 'Gyeonghoeru', a Pavilion built in 1412 by King Taejong as a place to host banquets and State meetings. Set in the middle of a man-made lake it was a vision of tranquillity when I was there bathed in golden Autumn late afternoon sunlight. Take a walk around the lake and head north to the top of the Palace complex where you will find another lake with a very picturesque (and photogenic, see my images) two-storied octagonal structure called the 'Parujeong' which was built in 1888 and used as a library by King Gojong.  All in all this is a Palace well worth a visit but it can get very busy... I would recommend going in the later part of the afternoon (I arrived at 15:30) when the crowds are a bit less and when the late afternoon light brings out the best of this special Seoul attraction."
1665,4.0,"10am is the time you must be there for the main event of changing of the guards, they do it every hour but 10am has the most number of guards who participates."
1666,4.0,go with a volunteer tour guide. you will learn a bit of korean history esp on the joeson dynasty. It takes about 2 hours and the tour ends at the Blue House .
1667,4.0,"This is such a pretty place to visit while in Seoul! Do spend the time to walk around the area, snap some photos and enjoy the lovely stroll! I was lucky to be there while they had the guard changing ceremony, try to catch that if you can :) There is a small fee (about KRW 3,000) to enter."
1668,5.0,The Gyeongbokgung Palace is a must see in Seoul. You can learn a lot about the history and culture of South Korea. The architecture and artwork are superb! It is also a lot of fun to see the guards in front of the palace. It's a very photogenic place with the mountains as a backdrop.
1669,4.0,"Had our reservations when deciding whether to visit Gyengbokgung or not. Having visited the Forbidden City and having heard this was the Korean equivalent, we thought we would end up seeing pretty much the same thing. Given we did not enjoy or like the Forbidden City all that much, that was worrisome.  Luckily, despite similar styles (due to Korean history) we thoroughly enjoyed the visit to the palace. It is extremely accessible and it does not feel like you are seeing the same building or pavilion over and over again. It also did not feel particularly crowded at all and it was very easy to navigate. The grounds of the palace were also extremely nice to stroll in and it was definitely an added bonus to have the National Folk Museum adjoining to the palace. Even extra added bonus, the entrance/exit closest to the National Folk Museum is a stone throw away from the Bukchon area.  Definitely recommended and would suggest to take half a day to visit the palace itself, the grounds and the National Folk Museum."
1670,5.0,Also liked this palace. It was a couple of subway stops from Bukchon. A guard showed me where they were putting on a play. Enjoyed the buildings and the guards dressed up in traditional clothes. There in 4/13
1671,5.0,Impressive complex of beautiful buildings. Very busy with lots of tourists and Koreans (or especially because of?) on Christmas Day. Be sure and wait/plan for a tour in English as the tour guides are impressively informed and give you all kinds of history/cultural lessons that are unforgettable.
1672,5.0,"this palace is one of the palaces worth visiting...you can see the fine architecture in each of the pillars, colors of the palace..if you can catch the guided tour so much better to have a deeper understanding of the Palace's history..."
1673,3.0,"This palace is just an empty palace. To know more about the palace, please get a tour. Otherwise, you can buy the palace brochure for 500 won. Audio guides are available as well.  Nothing much to see except for the huge area use to construct the palace, many are reconstructed back as it was damaged and of cause the guard changing ceremony for the first timers.  Nevertheless, an eye opener for first timers.  I went there during December, as the place is covered with mud and melted snow, it gets quite dirty for your shoes as well as for your legs (jeans).  Please also take note that as the roof are constructed like in the olden days, they have a down slope roof, therefore melted snow (ice) will slide and drop down, please be careful when you are touring the palace especially if you have kids."
1674,3.0,"It's not an old building, you can take some time to visit, but no need to stay for hours."
1675,3.0,"The compound area is huge but the palace itself is empty. Nothing. Few pieces of furniture. Artwork? It's not even 100 years old. I was told 90% of the buildings was demolished during Japanese occupation during 1911, it so frustrating. Nevertheless, I was awed with the Change of Guard Ceremony. I think people does not care much about history as long as they can brag about it and take many as many pics around this palace. Compared to many palaces & castles I've been, this doesn't left much impression on me."
1676,4.0,Nice big place to learn about Korea's history. Do see the changing of guards ceremony and do consider the free guided tour provided.
1677,5.0,"We visited this beautiful palace last week (13/Dec) and it was absolutely beautiful.  As it was just starting to get very cold, we happen to see the lake freezing up.  No words can describe the beauty of this place so make it a place to visit if you are in Seoul.  The price of entry is also very very cheap.. kids are free as well... and the palace is located next to its own subway station..  So there is no reason to not visit this wonderful and beautiful palace..."
1678,4.0,"You must see Gyeongbokgung when you are in Seoul. Admission fee is not much. Personally, I felt that a guide wasn't required; if you do your own basic research you'll still be able to appreciate it. You can easily spend 2-4h just walking around and admiring the palace."
1679,5.0,"I have visited here twice. It is much better in summer than in winter since in the winter, it is too cold to linger and take in the atmosphere and the historic plaques. It is rather extensive with a lot to see. You can spend a whole day there since on the grounds are the National Folk Museum and the National Palace Museum. It is also quite close to the Blue House, the residence of the President of South Korea.Down the road in front of the main entrance is the American Embassy and a long promenade where protesters gather."
1680,4.0,"The palace is really easy to get to. You could take the subway line, and there is a stop directly next to the palace. I would recommend to come early as there are many tourist groups coming to this location at the later hours.  Also, make sure to see the changing of the guards."
1681,5.0,"A vast collection of ancient Korean buildings, representing the culture of royalty in former days, with countless examples of historical architecture. Although surrounded by a very active city, once you step inside you feel transported to the way life was several hundred years ago. Much history can be learned, and at least a half day is needed to do justice to this ancient palace."
1682,5.0,Sort of reminded me of the Forbidden City in Beijing on a smaller scale. Looks very vibrant beautiful. I understand that much of it burned at one point & had to be restored. They did a great job!
1683,4.0,We visited this place though it was snowing. We went to the virtual images on the 2nd floor and had a virtual inter action with the present president of Korea. We shook hands and took pictures that were e mailed to us. Nice concept!
1684,4.0,"Like - Grandness, the authenticity of the place, the awesome ceremonial spectacle,free costumes (of ancient guards), coffee shop inside the palace square, iconic red pillars, and great architecture. For me, you've never really seen it, unless you've been here.  Dislikes - too many tourists at times! Good thing, the place is huge so you could veer away as far as possible! The whole place closes by 5-6pm though. Not a perfect spot for sunsets, twilight, and all... Not too many signposts to indicate what you're looking at (guess I need to find a tour guide for this part, LOL)."
1685,4.0,"Palace tour is one of the tour recommended in seoul as there is few of them , I have visit all I can say that they are all look same for me same style and design not much different , you can access them all by subway if you have free tour and if you use city tour then this palace is one of bus stop plan to visit at midday as frequently at midday they have some activity to watch there from that palace u can wake to the city center seoul station hope you enjoy the trip and this place there is entrance fees"
1686,4.0,"We see the changing of the guards from the inside and had a tour here, we joined the english tour and the tour guide is good. Im a fan of some koreanovelas and i was able to learn the simple detail and their meaning."
1687,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace Built in 1394 as the main palace of the Joseon Dynasty(1392-1910)by its founder King Taejo, it is the most comprehensive and grandest of the five palace of the period. Gyeongbokgung, the oldest palace of the Joseon Dynasty, is located at the northern end of Seojong-ro Street. On its grounds stands the National Folk Museum of Korea, where visitors can brower the unique cultural and historical traits of Korea and the lifestyle of bygone days.  Cheongwadae (The Blue House) This is the presidential residence of the Republic of Korea. Tours of Cheongwadae have been conducted since 1998.  National Folk Museum of Korea. As the only national museum on folklore, it displays about 4,000 items on Korea’s traditional way of life. There are three permanent exhibition halls, two special exhibition halls, a shop and a reference room."
1688,4.0,"It's gigantic. It is closed on Tuesday- so take note. Oddly, there were quite a few places closed on Tuesdays."
1689,4.0,"It seems as though the tourist guides and hotel concierge have a limited list of suggested destinations in Seoul. However, Gyeongbokgung Palace is rightfully found on everyone's list. The historical lessons are very important and you will learn a great deal by visiting this site. But if relaxing in a beautiful park is what you really want to do, this is a great place for that as well. There is also a very nice folk museum. Try to plan your visit around the changing of the guards. This is really special experience."
1690,5.0,"The palace is a fantastic place. I understand it was rebuild after the Japanese destroyed the original but it is hard to tell. It looks fairy-tale like in its setting (esp. if you look towards the mountains). In the middle of a busy city, an oasis of tranquility. There are daily performances too. You have to do a lot of walking."
1691,3.0,"The main and biggest royal palace in Seoul. It's nice, but don't expect anything spectacular. After a while you understand it's a series of similar looking courtyards and traditional palace buildings, that at least for the average tourist look similar (only differ in sizes). It's not a palace where you visit the interior of the rooms. The highlights there (for me) where: The changing of guard ceremony - the main ceremony is nice to watch once. The guards are dressed in different colors, carry different flags and weapons. They shout orders, the drum beats. But you quickly get the idea, and the ceremony is a bit long... And also there is a nice pond inside (you need to pass through several courtyards), near a building, and a picturesque view in the background. A good place to take pictures. About wheelchair accessibility: there are ramps there to enter from one courtyard to another. In some places they have stone paths at the perimeter of the yards. But I would advise to have assistance, as the middle of the yard is uneven and has stones or gravel. You can't climb to the palace buildings (steps). The stone path at the perimeter sometimes is occupied by people, sometimes you need to climb a step or the passage is narrow. So it's not easy there unless you have help."
1692,4.0,a palace with beautiful surroundings. we went there in autumn and really enjoyed the colourful trees
1693,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the key attraction in Seoul, its easily accessible via the seoul subway station ""Chungmuro Station"" and its just a 10 mins walk via the underpass. As we went there quite late around 4 PM We took the option of buying the 1 palace ticket.  And we took the chance to explore the different parts of the astounding palace, unfortunately we didn't get to see the change of guard.  As the Palace close around 6pm, if you are considering to explore the other palace as well, its advisable to get there early, as the entire compound of the palace might took abit of your time to explore."
1694,3.0,one of the palace you can see in the compound. there is a pond in front where you can see fish. we dont know if we can see inside.. but most of the palace was for outside viewing only
1695,5.0,Changing guards is daebak (Amazing!). I went during winter it was very cold but worth it. I didn't take any guide I suggest to just purchase the map and take your time to explore the huge palace.
1696,5.0,"The palace and the whole scenario is just beautiful. I visit it during autumn, it was a sunny day, so it was gorgeous to see the yellow and red foliage among the palace constructions. From the palace you can see a beautiful mountain full of colorful trees too. The change of guards is also a interesting thing to see."
1697,4.0,"Like the other royal palaces in Seoul, this palace is actually a palace campus. It is the premier palace for the Joseon kings. It was destroyed in 1600s by the Japanese and rebuilt in 1800s. There were around 500 buildings inside the campus at that time. But the Japanese invaded Korea once again in early 20th century and almost all the buildings were destroyed. After the WW2 some of the most important parts were once again rebuilt. Nowadays it looks quite good. If you don't have much time, you should see this palace as the representative of the 4 royal palaces in Seoul. By the way, the palace offers free guided tours in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese a few times a day. I strongly recommend you to join one of those tours. After the visit, I recommend you a walk towards the Gwanghwamun Square."
1698,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is the most famous palace in Korea and is well worth spending an hour or two wandering around the complex.  Admission is cheap at only $3,000KW ($3) and has a few pretty buildings and traditional Hanok type houses inside.  There is a Changing of the Guard ceremony which is fun to watch for a few minutes. The children section, which has mock-ups of traditional Korean shops and houses is fun for kids and there are a few galleries if you like this sort of thing.  Definitely a fun day if you combine wandering around the Insadong area and Bukchon Hanok Village."
1699,5.0,Wonderful place! This was truly a journey back in time. Be prepared to take 1.5 hours because the area is huge! I recommend checking out the surrounding area as well if you can still walk. ;)
1700,5.0,English Tour:  Gyeongbokgung Palace @ 10.30 am  Secret Garden @ 11.30 am  Do buy a combo or combined ticket for 10 000 won.
1701,5.0,"The palace has been restored to some of it's former glory. The 48 - columned pavilion, Gyeonghoero, is outstanding. Do not miss the imposing Genjeongjeong with its spacious courtyard and surrounding corridors, illustrating the splendour of the dynasty. Check out the attractive lily pond, the island pavilion of Hyangwonjeon, the rock garden and the residential quarters."
1702,4.0,"We did not go inside the palace but seeing the 'Changing of the Guards' was cool. Be there by 930am to witness this ceremony. However, kindly ensure to respect their rules. You cannot have pictures taken near the guards... Just keep your distance. The palace ground is very spacious so take time to enjoy the place.  The subway leading to the side entrance of the Palace has cool artsy stuff so take time to explore. Don't forget to also stand in front of the palace and just observe the city."
1703,5.0,"You will not regret visit this place.. enjoy everything about it! Love to see the nice traditional building, and they maintain them nicely and super clean!"
1704,4.0,Relatively new for a palace. Only 200 years old. They have kept it well preserved. Easy and quick to go through. There are some features in this palace that is unique to Korea compared to other palaces in Asia.
1705,4.0,"The Palace is well worth a visit. Although the lines for the ticket booth were long, they moved fast. Tickets cost 3000 Won for one museum. There is a nice park on the right hand side of the Palace."
1706,4.0,"there are many beautiful things to see here and with the mountains in the background it makes it even better. The audio guide is worth it, it tells you many things that you might have otherwise missed. The colours are so rich and clean. If you enjoy palaces you should go. The grounds are beautiful as well with flowers and ponds everywhere."
1707,3.0,Nice reconstruction. We went at 10am for the change of the guards as we were told that was the most spectacular. It was nice that everyone had a good spot to take photos and nice backgrounds. English speaking tour did not have enough detail though.
1708,5.0,Very near to the Museum and Cheongwadae (The Blue House). It was rather packed for it was a public holiday. The palace was well maintained and we managed to catch the changing of the guards....a colourful event. Near to subway station.
1709,5.0,"We visit the palace during the cultural week in Seoul, so there was an interesting exhibition in the front court of the palace of virtual and augmented reality where a traditional book comes to live, it was really nice. Also the traditional dance made with little robots was really nice. As part of this cultural festival, there was at night a light and sound free show displayed in the outer wall of the palace. The palace is huge and is worth visiting to get a glimpse of the cultural heritage of Korea."
1710,3.0,"If you are interested in seeing the cultural soul in Seoul, then pay a visit to the Palace. Changing of the guard, beautiful gardens, intricate building designs and a whole lot of beauty all add for a fun visit - takes about 2 hours to see everything. It is easily accessible from the subway and there is a lot to see in the area. Also close by is the Blue House, where the Korean President resides."
1711,4.0,"This palace is the most important one in Seoul, so a must-visit! The area is vast, access is cheap (KRW 3000, just over EUR 2) and has interesting buildings and history. The buildings and the area and park are nice, but it is a bit hard to get the information. I would recommend to take a tour with a guide. The buildings have rather sober interiors. I recommend to visit the National Palace Museum which is directly beside the Gyeonbokgung palace. There you will get some more tangible and visible details of Korea's history."
1712,4.0,"This palace is huge and is very similar to the Changdeokgung palace. Although this palace does not have a secret garden like Changdeokgung, it has the change of guard ceremony, a two story feast building where the emperor entertained, and a pagoda(not accessible, but visible) in the background. Since the palace ground is vast, be prepared to spend at least 2 hours here if you want to see every inch, longer if you also want to visit the museum within. The palace is very well maintained, so well that the vibrantly painted colours robbed it of its authenticity. Because of that, I think Changdeokgung is more authentic, but the architecture is very similar. Come here for the grand palace experience, but be prepared to walk lots out in the open sun. In any case, I think it's a worthwhile experience in Seoul. :-)"
1713,2.0,The place is big but not much to see inside. Not recommend to go if the trip is short. You can just take a picture at the front door.
1714,5.0,"Allow at minimum a half-day to explore the palace. It took me a full day, including the museums. Wear comfortable shoes and expect to walk a lot! It was a great introduction to Korean history."
1715,4.0,"located in the center of seoul, just near american embassy. the palace is majestic and, unlike the other great palace in the capital, you can have the chance to admire the guard exchange. recommend"
1716,5.0,"I was fortunate to visit the Palace in January, with snow on the ground and on a wonderful clear day.  Firstly, there are the guards outside, in traditional uniforms - make sure you see the 'changing of the guard'.  Then the palace itself, which has been lovingly restored (having been ford down by the Japanese when they occupied Korea). It is a lovely place just to walk around - and an incredible space within the middle of a modern city.  Go to the national museum (adjoining the Palace grounds) after - to get an excellent picture of the history and culture of South Korea."
1717,4.0,"Really beautiful place, you can take good photos and enjoy the view. It's a must see in Korea, for sure."
1718,4.0,There is a National Folk Museum inside where you can learn about history and culture about Korea. The Palace architecture is unique.
1719,5.0,"The palace ground is really big and it is a great place for you to slow down your pace and walk around. I have been here a couple of time and no matter what season it is, it is a comfortable place. Once you get away from the bustling main entrance, the rest of the palace is very comfortable to explore on your own. The toilets are unexpectedly extremely clean."
1720,5.0,It is one of the museums that shows Korean traditional palace. I heard that the actual palace was burnt by Japanese and it was rebuilt by Koreans.
1721,4.0,"I visited the palace with a Korean friend of mine. He told that the palace has been destroyed and resurrected many times during Japanese and North Korean attacks. Seeing the quality of the buildings inside the campus was unbelievable considering the attacks. The repair work certainly has been fantastic. The palace is a typical of Medieval age Korean Architecture. Its huge, beautiful and elegant. I clicked a lot of pictures there. There is a small museum inside, which has a very interesting display of Korean civilisation starting from pre-historic period to medieval age. A must visit if you are in Seoul."
1722,3.0,We did Gyeongbokgung as a day trip/walk around several palace sites. We started at Deoksugung and walked up Gwanghwamun Square (currently filled with protesters which made it interesting).  I think the actual Palace at Gyeongbokgung was closed when we visited. Or maybe we simple missed something. Enjoyed the museum though.
1723,5.0,"I've been here with friends and Korean teacher for several years. That was so amazing Palace with large land and complex systems of King's Palace. You can come here by bus, underground or taxi quite advantage."
1724,5.0,This is a popular tourist destination and it is also very central to Seoul.  A few things you need to do here.  They have parade on changing the guard once every hour so it is well worth watching.  The buildings are nice and you can take beautiful photos. One particular spot was the building situated at the north western corner. It was built to entertain guests and it is surrounded by lake and trees. Beautiful.  And also have a look at the important painting in the central building where the King administered. It is called the sun moon 5 mountains. It is directly behind the throne of the King and it has great significance as the holder of power. You can also find the painting on one of the Korean Won notes.  So a place not to be missed plus it is so central to sejongdae ro. where you can see the great Admiral Yee statue and also King Sejong statue.
1725,3.0,"I made it for a guided tour in English on time (1.30pm), so it really helped a lot. The tour took about 1hr 30mins. People with interests in architecture or photography will have a blast. You can hop into the museum next door and come back in for free with your ticket stub.  The downside is that the palace and museum are filled with tourists and screaming kids, and its quite hard to get shots that you want without people in the background."
1726,4.0,"... they all look the same. however this one has a massive scale, lots of palaces within palaces, and nice park area and museum around it. however if you've been to the palaces and temples in japan and china, the ones in seoul can't compare"
1727,4.0,"This is the best of all the palaces in Korea. I strongly recommend a visit. Spend some time to explore the surroundings. You can easily walk to Insadong (another touristy spot in seoul), city hall..."
1728,4.0,Mainly just a big palace and cheap to gain entry.. A few little events going on soldiers marching about in traditional garb.. Not a bad spot to see but very little in the way of historical information that I could see.. Maybe I missed a booklet somewhere.
1729,3.0,"Expansive palace based on Chinese architecture. Not a spectacular building but some parts looked quite nice. Most buildings do look the same and even though restored you cannot go in the buildings. Limited information on the boards outside with barely any context given.  Changing of the guard takes place on the hour.  Closed on Tuesdays.  If you want to find out about the palace then get a guide, the visit Korea website has the times of tours."
1730,4.0,"The grounds are truly amazing and you can get a real feel for how life was in the past. Definitely recommend going and getting a tour if at all possible. Might be better to go in the warmer months, but was okay in the winter just dress warm. Easy enough access from the subway."
1731,5.0,"This palace was absolutely amazing, and was the most lovely sight during my trip to Japan and Korea last year. Definitely worth the trip."
1732,5.0,"The Best Palace to visit in my opinion!! I love K-Dramas and K-Movies and you know, just the feelings of walking in the same place, being there and seeing everything with my own eyes is best to discribe as breathtaking and exciting. Worth to see for yourself!"
1733,5.0,"The biggest palace in Seoul. Very interesting architecture - something totally different from Europe. All the palaces in Seoul have almost the same style but never think that all the palaces there look the same. Gyeongbokgung is a palace with a multitude of small buildings that had different functions. Gyeongbokgung has the typical complex used by the king, other by the queen, but also a complex of building were the dead body of the royals were held until the burial, and other complex used to hold the tables of the dead royals for the mourning period (2 years) etc. I recommend to save an entire day for this palace because the Korean Folk Museum is within the grounds of this palace, and when you buy the ticket for Gyeongbokgung the museum is included in the price. Furthermore, I also recommend to join a guided tour, you will find more interesting things about the palace, the kings and queens, the rules and habits. However, if you enjoy more the freedom of looking around without someone calling you all the time, and want to take your time to take some good shuts, try to look for the metal panels that are in front of or near each building, in order to get some information about the use of specific building, when it was build, by orders of who and if there happened something important (at the ticket box you will not get a brochure with information about the buildings, you only get a map of the palace) Keep in mind, the ground of this palace is very extended! Also, you will walk on dusty soil, so use proper shoes. Don't use sandals or flip- flops if it is summer and you have sensitive feet. TIP: visit it on Monday because on Monday the other palaces are closed."
1734,4.0,"We visited Gyeongbokgung palace on a very hot and crowded day on Chuseok (the largest Korean national holiday, similar to thanksgiving). It was extremely busy with many tourists and Koreans alike. The size of the grounds themselves were the most impressive to me. I loved the big pond/lake and the parks around the palace. There's not much to see of the palace itself but its still a good experience. We saw the changing of the guards in their traditional colourful uniforms."
1735,4.0,If you're in Seoul this is certainly worth a visit. It's amazing to see something so huge right in Central Seoul. I'd recommend a tour - it helps get a real appreciation for the site and it's history. Don't miss the changing of the guard - what a hoot! Some great photo opportunities here with the dramatic hills in the background.
1736,3.0,"Seems like a must go place if you happen to be in Seoul but don't get your hopes high. Most of the buildings were reconstructed only 15 years ago so don't expect to see 1000 year old ancient palaces and the reconstructed buildings were modern and artificial looking.  As we were about to leave, we just happened to catch the changing of guards ceremony, and it was pretty cool."
1737,4.0,"You really dont have to go in to see the throne. The infrastructure is the same as from the outside. Catch the guard changing ceremony at the entrance. That's good. after the ceremony, remember to stay outside so that you can get a picture with the guards. After that, head back to the main area where you can get to dress up as a guard for free! Head there early as the booth closes quite fast after the ceremony."
1738,4.0,"We went specially to see the guard change ceremony. The guard change happens at 11am, 2pm and 4pm. Quite nice to view the ceremony and quite an experience taking photos with the guards.  It is very easy to get to it. Just beside the MTR. The palace is very unlike what I had seen in Forbidden City in Beijing. It is less lavish, however, loved the huge architecture and the huge amount of space in the palace. With the mountain as backdrop, it was quite a tranquil and awesome sight to behold.  Audio guide is available. It is running via GPS, thus, once you reached a certain area of the palace compound, the audio guide will start speaking. Found it to be brilliant as in some other countries, some audio guides work on number of steps or you will have to key in a certain code for it to explain.  Good experience for the family."
1739,4.0,"Yes, its touristy and crowded (the most tourists I saw in my 10 days in seoul) but its still a beautiful place to see, if you can catch the changing of the guards it will be all the better... i think its only twice a day  Its good to take a book with you or an audio guide so you know the history behind the buildings and the sections of this complex  TICKETS - if you want to go to the other 5 main temples get the package deal for 10,000won"
1740,4.0,Take a tour in between your shopping to see this palace and it is worth going. Not as grand as the China one but somehow good to understand the Korean culture.
1741,5.0,"This place is one of my favorite memories of Korea. I first came here in winter and it was such an experience to see the frozen over lake and pavilion. Recently I returned in the spring time and found the whole feel of the palace grounds changed, with the greens of spring. I'm sure it must be beautiful to see in autumn as well, with the changing colors of the leaves.  If you enjoy experiencing history and olden-day culture, you will have good time here. I personally found that 3 hours was not enough to fully explore the extensive palace grounds and the folk museum. Sure, you can complete a walk-thru under 1 hour, but that is just like a stop-and-go kind of tour. Every palace is different and has its own story to tell. You may enjoy the palace a bit more with the help of a tour guide who is knowledgeable about the history of the palace - either the free timed tours or with a youth volunteer.  I plan to return to Gyeongbukgung again, hopefully in the winter, to experience its understated grandeur and beauty again."
1742,3.0,The palace itself is interesting that it has a lot of influence from Chinese architectural design - the Emperors seat is much better kept than the Forbidden city - clean n tranquil for relaxing walks n picture taking- nothing much to see except the changing of guards that is very interesting to take pictures with them :-)
1743,5.0,love the atmosphere here relaxing and traditional. museum located inside is also worth visiting. reasonable price
1744,4.0,"We visited the palace on May Day so it was quite busy but the liveliness was also welcoming. The palace is in great condition with a few rooms you can see in and is in pretty good shape. I wish there was more information throughout of the history or tours that you can sync with your cell phones so you can learn the great history that happened there. With such a technologically advanced society, I think they could do more with that but otherwise, it was great. There were a lot of rock sculptures which were wonderful for pictures!!"
1745,5.0,"My second time to this attraction and it takes my breath away each time. Grounds are clean and well cared for, free torus are in a variety of languages and the changing of the guard is so much fun with the music, movement and yelling! This is also one of the few attractions in Seoul that is open on Mondays."
1746,4.0,"One of the main reasons for visiting Seoul is for its rich history, dating back centuries to the Joseon Dynasty. There are fortresses, memorials, imposing city gates from ancient times, and grand palaces scattered around the city. I have visited each of the main palaces in Seoul on multiple occasions. I enjoyed all of them, although I do have a particular predilection for Gyeongbokgung Palace.  Gyeongbokgung Palace was the largest and most important of the five grand palaces built, way back in 1395, although it has since been destroyed by Imperial Japan and then restored to something resembling its former glories. Nowadays it serves as one of Seoul’s main tourist attractions and as well as hosting the National Folk Museum of Korea inside its grounds, there are captivating ‘changing of the guard’ ceremonies held a few times each day, which is a great event to capture on video. Gyeongbokgung is located close to another of my favourite places in Seoul, namely Bukchon Hanok Village (a traditional Korean village of old). It is also located within easy walking distance from both the Cheonggyecheon area of downtown Seoul and the Myeongdong shopping district."
1747,4.0,"Was rather cold when I visited in early April. Very large grounds. Even with guided English tour, it was very tiring to walk around. The architecture and cherry blossoms were beautiful. Definitely worth a visit. Comes with free visit to the folk museum."
1748,4.0,"We took the English guided tour at 11.00 sharp. Lasted for just over 1 hour. Beautiful pictures within the Palace, with the cherry blossom trees in full bloom in the second week of April. The Korean guide, dressed in the traditional Korean costume, with her American accent and cute mannerisms kept you entertained with her well rehearsed structured presentation. Certainly, in terms of sheer opulence and beauty, the Palaces in Korea do not compare with the Maharaja Palaces in India or those in Europe, but a must for the Seoul visitor. You can purchase a combination ticket for 10,000 KRW ($10) to visit all 4 Palaces valid for 30 days. Dont miss the Changing of the Guard at 10.00am, 1.00pm, and 3.00pm sharp. Photo Op with the guards in their period attire at all times opposite the Main Gate."
1749,4.0,"2nd time that I have been to this palace. This time, we took my parents. It is one of the palaces that I recommend if you are in Seoul. It was a clear day so you could see the mountains making a great back drop along with some flowering cherry trees. They do a changing of the guard ceremony at various times so check the schedule. It is located so that if you have time you can go to multiple locations from the palace such as the National Folk Museum, Insadong, Bukchon Hanok Village, and other palaces. There is a fee of 3,000w for adults less for kids and you can also get a pass for other palaces. There was a restaurant near the subway exit in the palace, but you can walk to restaurants outside the palace as well. We took the subway."
1750,4.0,"it is best to navigate the place with a tour guide so you can appreciate the history around it but going here by yourself is ok. i think there is a fee but our tour guide paid for it as part of the tour so i am not sure about the charges. the place is huge and as per the tour guide, it will take you 4 hours to tour the entire palace. the place was restored as it was damaged by the war but still looks ancient so i think that is a good thing as it still gives that old era vibe. there is a museum inside that explains the history of korea. there is also a changing of guard ceremony every 3pm except tuesdays. the guards have this nice traditional soldier attire that really gives that old korea look. you can also have your pictures taken with the guards. i particularly liked the roof. very artistic. the place is near bukchon and insa-dong area so if you are nearby that place, you can take a walk or a 5-10 minute cab ride."
1751,5.0,"I greatly enjoyed my visit to Gyeongbokgung - I'd recommend taking the (free!) English tour (I believe Korean, Chinese and Japanese are also offered if any of those happen to be your preferred langauge), as I feel that was the best way to learn all the little quirks of the palace and its history. They run twice a day, so check beforehand. Our guide was very knowledgable and dressed in traditional costume, which was a cute touch! I've seen a few reviews comparing this palace with the Forbidden City in Beijing - I've been to both, and I believe Gyeongbokgung is definitely different enough to warrant a visit (besides, comparing anything to the Forbidden City seems a little unfair!).  Some of the buildings are only open from April onwards, and since I visited in March they were obviously closed - that was a little disappointing, but it didn't really take anything away from the experience. Make sure you see the changing of the guards - it happens every hour on the hour, so it's pretty easy to catch. The palace costs 3000W to visit, or you can by the combined ticket for 10000W (which I recommend, as it gets you into 5 locations across Seoul). Overall, I quite enjoyed myself!"
1752,4.0,"An interesting place, amazing that it's been completely rebuilt. Join the free guided tour, you'll notice a lot of details that you would have otherwise missed."
1753,4.0,"About similar in structure to Changdeokgung palace, but Gyeongbokgung palace appears to me to be bigger in size, more vast. It's a beautiful palace, worth a visit and do make it in time for the change of guard ceremony as i did not see it at the other palace."
1754,4.0,"The ground are huge, the buildings very attractive although not original (those were destroyed in multiple wars). Fun to see but not very impressive, there is also very little written explanation on site Go to Seoul History Museum first (15 min walk from palace), that helps a lot in understanding what you see"
1755,4.0,"Only 300 yen entrance fee. Conveniently there's a money exchange place/ tourist info place right inside the palace next to the ticket booth. Although the palace itself is quite simple, the land area is massive. I like how right behind the palace there's a majestic mountain behind it. It's very picturesque from afar. And the contrast between nature & city makes it all that more interesting. The changing of the guard was sort of neat I suppose.  They have 3 English tours available per day...but I'm so glad I didn't join it. It would have been unbearable in my opinion...especially if you're pressed for time.  I just wish they had ""MORE"" English descriptions around the place for us to understand what different places were used for. They had a few captions here and there....but it was few and far between."
1756,5.0,"This is a nice historic place to visit. Small entree fee, big area to see how the King lived here for some hundreds years ago. Museum is included. After visit you can have a great walk to downtown Seoul."
1757,3.0,My family and I were only able to go around half of the whole place but everything was so picturesque! Made me feel like I was part of the numerous history dramas Koreans would do. Haha!  I suggest you check the schedules of their tours or make sure to get a map or just try your best not to get lost because it's a really big place. A bit disappointed because we weren't able to cover the whole thing but it was nice! They have a small museum inside so you better check that out as well!
1758,4.0,"Brings back memories of the Forbidden City in Beijing. Catch the changing of the guard on the hour, but make sure you don't get in their way because the route is not obvious. An interesting Palace, with lots of buildings. However, you do need a guide as there is very little explanation on the way round. Covers a big area in the centre of Seoul."
1759,5.0,"We have 4 major royal palaces of Chosun dynasty? and actually other ones are bigger than this one. So someone can think, other ones are better. But if you study our history, than you can notice the importance of this one. When my buddies stop by Seoul, I always come to this one, rather than other palaces.(1~2day is not enough for you to see every palace, so if you are going to stay just one or two days, you have to choose the palace to see) This one is a major palace and it was burned during the Japanese colonial, so very important historic site. I recommend you to come here. I came here with my British friend just a few days ago, and he said it was great."
1760,4.0,"The palace was huge and very crowded with locals and tourists. You should catch the guard changing ceremony, which was held several times a day. Luckily when we came, it was sunny thus we could take some pictures with the mountains background. Make sure to visit the lake near the back, as it was very gorgeous."
1761,4.0,The palace itself is very nice but I liked the lake area much more! It was frozen when we were there and quite a lit if tourist. The ticket price was not that expensive. The changing of guards was interesting fur the kids.
1762,3.0,I was excited to see the Gyeongbokgung Palace but ended up getting disappointed. The place was nice and vast however there is nothing much to see inside. There's a lot of buildings that look the same.
1763,5.0,"The most extensive palace in Seoul. Relative to the others this one charges 3000 vs. 1000 to get in, just a relative measure of the expectations.  The changing of the guards was nice but we found the changing at Deoksugung was more elaborate but the site is there is less impressive.  If you only go to one palace this is the one to go to."
1764,4.0,"The main attraction here is the changing of guards which happens every hour. Do wear comfortably as the palace area is quite huge with many small buildings and you need to walk a lot. This is the largest palace among all the palaces in Seoul. Admission fee is 3000 Won for adult. If you brought the Integrated pass (10000 Won), this palace admission fee is included."
1765,4.0,"It is recommended that you take a tour to fully understand the history of the palace. The architectures are great and well maintained. It is a very big place to explore, and do remember to put on anti slip shoes when visiting in winter as the place can get quite muddy and slippery when the ice melts."
1766,3.0,Stupendously magestic! Took a lot of pictures! When you get here be ready with your cameras. There's an entrance fee of 3K won.
1767,4.0,The architecture of the palace is beautiful and very clean area. It is said by the ticketing officer that Gyeongbokgung is one part the other palace which is located at the north. Nice palace in the heart of the city .
1768,5.0,"I think it takes like full day if you want to see every bit of Gyeongbokgung. It tells you once we(Korea) have Dynasty that a period of peace and prosperity...yes we do have some dark era in that history as well. If you want to know about Korea, it's like the top of the MUST SEE list. Don't miss it."
1769,4.0,Gyeongbokgung Palace complex housed some of the most amazing and beautiful architectural design I've ever seen. The main palace building and the pavilion behind it. A visit here during winter when the artificial lake and fields are covered white with snow would be breath-taking.
1770,3.0,"Yes it's very pretty and it has changing of the guards show, which is really cool. But once inside there is a couple of nice buildings and a beautiful temple near the back. You can't go inside anything. And there isn't anything inside when you can peek inside. So you're basically walking around the outside. Go if you have time, or just stop to see the changing of the guard and heard to the other palace."
1771,5.0,"Unfortunately when I went to see Gyeongbokgung it was raining, however it's beauty still left me in awe. Make sure to see this place when the weather is good as there's a lot of walking outdoors! and getting your feet soaked is not ideal. A great place to come to to learn more about the history of Korea and see some beautiful traditional architecture which I've found hard to find in Korea - but I may be looking in the wrong places. Definitely a highlight in Seoul, don't miss it."
1772,5.0,"This was a breath-taking place. There was beauty everywhere you looked. The grand structures of the palace and surrounding buildings were fascinating. A terrific place for photos! The museum inside was very modern and had multi-media displays along with models, samples and preserved treasures from the past. It was interesting to be in a palace right inside a busting metropolis."
1773,4.0,"This is a nice place to be in, especially if you have a tour guide to explain to you about the history and whatever that took place in the palace many years ago. I was freezing when I was there (about 2 degrees?) and the scenery was pretty because the pond froze :D"
1774,4.0,I enjoyed the feng shui influencing the palace's design...coupled with other intelligent building design features..
1775,4.0,there are some free areas - where you can take pics with guards ... but that is enough for the family to handle
1776,5.0,"The main palace, really beautifull. Don't miss the gards at the entrence and try to catch the changing of guards. Around you also have the National Folk Museum which is also nice. Any trip in Seoul should include this palace."
1777,5.0,"It was fun to walk around Gyongbokgung and adjacent areas talking pictures and observing locals. Although I was not familiar with the historical aspect of the place, it was interesting enough to just stop and contemplate."
1778,5.0,"I visited this palace on last Sunday and i trust me it is amazing. It is situated in the heart of city but still so calm and peaceful. Anyone visitng korea should visit this palace. To go there you can take subway. Either you should get down at Anguk or Gyeongbokgung station. It is at walk-able distance from both stations. About Palace : If you are visiting this palace, you should take out atleast 2-3 hours of your busy schedule.Entry fee for palace is 3500 KRW for one palace and for all three palace it is 9000 KRW. It is situated on large area. Following things you must do: - Please check English guide tour. It is free and very much informative. - Please check guard changing ceremony timing. It is must see thing at palace. - Visit party area of the palace which is situated inside lake. Take a picture with it. - Take a picture with guard. - Enjoy beautiful greenery at palace. Specially in autumn.  To Eat : - There is some roadside food is available outside palace. You can try that on your own risk. It is good."
1779,4.0,Very impressive from outside but I was a bit disappointed with the interiors of the buildings. The small lake and trees within the vicinity are quite nice.
1780,5.0,"This largest of the five grand palaces of the Joseon Dynasty has been lovingly restored since it was first destroyed by fire and then the Japanese during the occupation of the early 20th Century. A wonderful example of great feng shui, this beautiful palace illustrates ""paesanimsu""... mountains behind and streams in front. Protected by the Bukhan Mountains to the north and fed by the Han River in front of the palace, this is an ideal setting for a royal palace. This huge complex is fun to explore, wandering from building to building and imagining the lives of royals and the commoners who served them some 600 years ago. We were told that Gyeongbokgung Palace is more influenced by Chinese architectural principles (more of a grid style), while Changdeokgung Palace is designed more from a traditional Korean layout. As a visitor, the changing of the guards is interesting and can make for good photos -- I would recommend a good telephoto lens to really capture the colorful outfits and facial expressions. The gate is most beautiful at night. I understand the Palace is open at night during the summer, this was not the case during our October visit. The Pavillion was interesting, though the lack of an English speaking guide during the ""reservations only"" tour limited some of the power of this part of the experience. Because of its location in the city, this site can become quite crowded... be patient and learn to go where the groups don't go. This may lead to little discoveries. Of the palaces in Seoul, Gyeongbokgung Palace is the largest and most impressive by sheer size. We personally thought that the Changdeokgung Palace was the most elegant and beautiful. I am glad we saw both."
1781,5.0,a completely different world here right in the heart of the city. Easy to get to and also have the museum nearby. Architectural wonder. A MUST if you're in Seoul.
1782,5.0,"Wonderful place to visit. Very quite towards the evening. During the day, the large amount of people is diluted is the vey big area of the park. It is from far the better maintained one and the garden is gorgeous."
1783,5.0,"Easy to get to as it is located in the metro station that bears its name. It is the largest palace grounds as well as one of the most beautiful. Has guided tours in korean, mandarin chinese, english & japanese. Looks out for the palaces within the palace grounds especially the one located in the middle of the lake, and also the pagoda with the bridge on the water lily pond. Those will be your highlights. The palace is also located near the Blue House (or Cheongwadae) which is the presidential palace, and also a few museums and the Gwanghwamun Square."
1784,5.0,"If you have watched all those Korean period dramas, you will enjoy this place. Try to join the tour, there's english, japanese and chinese tour."
1785,5.0,This palace is very beautiful. The rooftop is colourful and the painting is nice. The different buildings are beautifl. A good place to visit.
1786,3.0,"I think this palace has the beauty of its kind though it could have been kept better. Lots of nice scenery here and there and there are hourly royal guard changing ceremony from 9am-3pm. It's the most famous and biggest palace in Korea. Here, other than visiting, the palace, you can meet tourists that can speak English, Korean ppl and students who actually visit the palace ( in which normally ppl in other countries won't be doing that) and you can get the feel of being a kind in such palace. However, I don't understand what is wrong with Koreans especially those from Seoul. Most of them are very unfriendly especially young pretty girls, couples and man in business suits. You try to speak to them even in Hangul, they will ignore you. Plus, it's surprising that their English are very poor. Even they themselves don't really speak to other Koreans they don't know. Usually it's couples speaking themselves which are abundant or girls in groups speaking themselves. That really annoyed me a lot and changed my impression of Koreans through drama. This is where you meets the reality of Koreans instead of those fantasies in drama. However, don't give up trying to ask for help if you need it because it's like striking a lottery where out of 50 people, there might be 1 who are willing to try to basically help you. I was a bit lucky to meet 2 Koreans who helped me to find my way to my hotel from the Gimpo Airport(terribly bad for tourist). Seriously, if S. Korea aims to earn travellers' money, please be more friendly and improve your English as it's the globally spoken language. Prepare for lots of walking if you are not joining a tour group though. No offence though. Tips when looking for help: target for older uncle and auntie, and also not so cool and friendly looking ppl. I would say it's easier to approach guys in younger ppl."
1787,5.0,"Everything about this place is amazing: the beauty, the location, the history, the technologies. My advice: take a guide. They will give you precious stories about the life in the kingdom and within the palace. Stay also for the staged ceremonies: it is very interesting for the kids. If you have time, walk all around the palace: there are plenty of art galleries, or just watch people passing by. Seoulites are always interesting to watch!"
1788,4.0,"Great complex. A guard changing ceremony happens during the day, definitely should be seen. I believe this place should be visited with a guide so every stone and building detail would make more sense."
1789,4.0,"Alight at Gyeongbokgung Station where the 5 largest grand palaces are in Seoul. We dropped by National Palace Museum's cafe to have brunch before braving through the cold. We managed to witness the guards march when we were there too. We bought the entrance tickets at the info counter for our English Tour which cost 3000KW each and it will last for about an hour. The tour guide will bring you through the whole of Gyeongbokgung and explain to you in details what each of these palaces means.  Managed to catch a glimpse of the fluffy cherry blossoms during the period when we were there. Overall, it's really a magnificent place rich in history in Korea. Worth visiting! For more on my trip to Gyeongbokgung, http://jacqsowhat.blogspot.sg/2013/06/seoul-korea-day-2.html"
1790,4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with the Gyeongbokgung palace complex. True, I had read that this was a place not to be missed, and so I was expecting something rather grand. What I did not expect was how expansive the grounds of this palace really are, especially the gardens and peripheral structures to the rear (north). In fact, the gardens and ornamental lakes were where I spent most of my time, and I thoroughly recommend that you get away from the main palace buildings and to lose yourself in this green and peaceful gardenscape if you can.  A few practicalities: I visited the palace on a Saturday afternoon, and to be honest the crowds weren't nearly as bad as I had expected (try doing the same thing at Beijing's Forbidden Palace, for instance). Still, a week day or early morning would definitely better for more solitude. The entrance fee of about US$3 is a real bargain, and you can get tickets valid for one month for about US$10 if you are staying in Seoul for a longer time. Try to arrive at the palace on foot and walk north on Gwanghwamun Plaza to get a really good idea of the grandeur of this magnificent palace, with the sharp granite mountains in the background.  If you only get to see one thing in Seoul, make sure it's the Gyeongbokgung palace. You won't be disappointed!"
1791,4.0,watched too much of k-drama and decided to visit this place. love it because have always wanted to visit the palace and get a feel of it. whole palace was very big and took us an hour plus to finish walking the entire palace. basically nothing inside and more of sightseeing.
1792,5.0,"With only a day to spend in Seoul and my original plan to visit the DMZ area scrapped because of military exercises, I spent a few hours at this beautiful national treasure. Great for walking amidst beautiful trees, and simple but ornate buildings. The roof-lines and eaves of the structures were really impressive. Definitely suggest this be on the itinerary of a visitor to Seoul."
1793,4.0,"Though it is a recently restored palace, you can still feel the history and grandness of the place. Perhaps I managed to catch the changing of the guard and saw people in period costumes so I was able to visualize Gyeongbokgung during its heyday. It is expansive and from the layout, it's like a smaller version of Beijing's Forbidden City.  I also made a mistake of visiting Changdeokgung first and regretted it when I saw the 2 for 1 ticket. Don't listen to the Lonely Planet advice of visiting only Changdeokgung if you only have one palace to visit. For me, Gyeongbokgung is grander and more evocative of the past despite its newly-restored surroundings. Plus, there are other attractions around the area like the Folk Museum and the Innsadong shopping street."
1794,5.0,"This is a must-see in Seoul but be prepared to spend a lot of time there (a few hours)-it is really big so put on your walking shoes. I took a self-guided tour which allowed me to see the palace at my own pace but if I had to do it over again, I would have taken a guided tour (there are three English speaking tours per day-11am, 1:30pm, 2:30pm). Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the “Five Grand Palaces” in Seoul and is the largest and most visited. It was the main palace in Seoul for 500 years and the kings and queens of the Joseon Dynasty would live here. Like the other Seoul palaces, this one was heavily damaged during the Japanese occupation and the Korean War so most of what you see is reconstructed but that doesn’t take away from the grandeur of the Korean architecture. The Royal Changing of the Guard ceremony (reenacted since 1996) is a must-see and happens three times a day (10am, 1pm, 3pm) inside the front gate.  After you pay the admission fee, you can get a pamphlet which details each building you see. The highlights for me were the Gwanghwamun Gate (main gate), the Geunjeongjeon (main throne hall), Hyangwonjeong Pavilion, Geoncheongung, and the trio of Parujeong, Jibokjae, and Hyeopgildang. There were also two pleasant surprises for me. The National Folk Museum of Korea is located on the grounds of the palace and although I didn’t plan to visit the museum, I did a quick tour to get a taste of it. If you make it all the way to the far side of the palace by Sinmumun Gate (North Gate) and walk outside, you will see a heavily guarded blue building. This is the Blue House and is where the President of South Korea lives and works.  I was able to visit three of the “Five Grand Palaces” in Seoul but if you only have time to visit one, Gyeongbokgung is the one to visit."
1795,3.0,Mostly reconstructed but you get a sense of what it was like originally. Watch out for the tour groups!
1796,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung is a palace which is beautiful, well-maintained and very clean. It's large and was once reconstructed. The entry fee is W3000, which is for me reasonable. While walking around this place, I felt like I was in a journey to the past haha. For people who love historical things, this is a must go when you come to Seoul."
1797,5.0,"This palace is very beautiful, well-maintained. The rooftop is colourful and the painting is nice. The different buildings are beautiful. The lake is beautiful as well. A good place to visit."
1798,5.0,It was really exciting to visit the royal place. I especially liked the Gate Guard Change ceremonies. I actually felt like i was in ancient times watching the royal guards perform so gracefully.
1799,5.0,"It is a very good place to visit. Highly recommended. It is massive, so make sure you wear a good pair of walking shoes."
1800,5.0,Beautiful palace! Especially enjoyed the changing of the guards ceremony. It's so unique. Very well-maintained area. Convenient location (right at MRT station). Highly recommended.
1801,5.0,"I love how Korean preserve their historical values and bring it to show the world. From here, I can really visualize how the changing guards ceremony truly was many hundred years ago!"
1802,4.0,"I visit this palace around 11.30am. Since at Korea it is very hard to find HALAL food, so I bring my own food and eat before I enter to this palace.  There will be a changing guard ceremony at 1.30pm, so you don't miss it.  You also able to try Korean Traditional costume, and during the time that I went there, the costume was Guard Costume.  This is the biggest palace in Seoul. The fee is 3000 won per entry.  In front of this palace, there is 3 monument. You can just cross the road and take pictures with it. And if you go straight, you can see famous stream in Seoul"
1803,4.0,"The grounds are enormous, so I recommend taking one of the guided tours to focus on the most important parts and be able to appreciate it more fully. Visit the Palace Museum on the premises."
1804,4.0,"Very well maintained and lots of nice photo opportunities all over the place. Lots of quaint views of small temples and trees and little nooks and cranies showing Korean houses and pathways. The museum is nice to visit as well, very informative and clean :)"
1805,5.0,"This place has been thoroughly restored and looks a bit too new, but it is quite spectacular, as is the surrounding scenery. Don't miss the changing of the guards ceremony, which seems to take place quite regularly."
1806,4.0,"My friend and I actually only planned 2 hours for Gyeongbokgung but turned out there wasn't enough time because the palace was HUGE!xD there were lots of buildings to visit and i don't think we finished walking the entire area because our feet were already sore from all the walking..haha. We walked around the palace without a guide but if you would like to know more about the palace and its history, it would be good to get one..they have Korean, Japanese, Chinese and English guides during certain time slots. If you're a fan of places with rich history and culture, then this place must not be missed!:)"
1807,5.0,Royal Guard Changing Ceremony that takes place only twice a day was fantiastic. The 3 museums in the palace were the among the best in the world and they were free.
1808,5.0,"This is a huge complex (probably the biggest of all palaces), with palace buildings, gardens, huge entry gate and guard parade. Very interesting and the view of the entry gate with the mountain in the background is good. The national folk museum is also situated in the grounds and is worth a look and was free at the time I went. Also if you go south of the gate along the central promenade of Sejongno Road, you will see Statues of the King and Admiral Yi. There is a free underground museum (entry at King's statue). Definitely worth visiting, especially the Admiral Yi exhibit."
1809,5.0,"This old palace complex was quite huge and it was located right in the city. The wooden arches and buildings were beautifully carved and decorated. They were simply magnificent. Our tour guide Jenny gave us a superb history of the old Korean royalty and how they lived. So if you are interested in Korean royalty and cultural history, this place is a must"
1810,5.0,A must visit. Just go for a walk around the lakes! Fish can be seen everywhere.... Many places to go through
1811,3.0,This palace teaches you a little more about Korean cultural in the early day. We were on a tour but it was hard to hear the tour guide and too many people to see some of the attractions there. I did enjoy learning more about Korea.
1812,5.0,At first I cant believe that such traditional and serene palace is exist in the middle of the busy Seoul. Inside this Palace complex there is a lot of other traditional building to see. If you love photography you would love this place. The palace building is huge with an authentic decoration. Also there is a lot of garden with beautiful scenery. Overall the palace complex is good and very attractive.
1813,4.0,"We were fortunate enough to visit the Palace when they lit up the place and allow visitors to come at night, so we spent half a day and the evening there. It was quite an experience as the Palace was packed with people. The Palace area is huge and the buildings are pretty however some may find the palace rather 'empty' and I do prefer Changdeokgung. The changing guards was quite fun to watch. For a good walk, go to Gwanghwamun Square and walk towards the Palace."
1814,5.0,"In the entire leadup to our Korea trip, Gyeongbokgung seemed like it would be THE palace to visit. Strangely enough, I feel like it may have been the one that we least explored. That may be due to the enormous size of the palace grounds. I also wasted too much time photographing the front areas of the palace and underestimated how much time was left in the day. You can really spend hours at Gyeongbokgung just relaxing in the various areas the palace has to offer.  While we were in front by Gwanghwamun gate, we saw some sort of guard ceremony. At the time, I thought it was their ""changing of the guard,"" but now that I'm seeing Youtube videos of the full ceremony, it can't have been it. Luckily, we caught the full ""changing of the guard"" at Deoksugung, so I'm good on that.  Based on my limited anecdotal knowledge, it seems like Gyeongbokgung is the most popular palace to visit. It's right off the main city square and it has the impressive Gwanghwamun gate to mark the main entrance. If you can only visit one palace, I'd probably recommend Changdeokgung with its beautiful Secret Garden and slightly smaller crowds. However, Gyeongbokgung is enormous and impressive. You can't go wrong either way. Go see them both!"
1815,5.0,A must see in Seoul. A great insight in Korean past with monumental building in combination with small more intimate locations.
1816,4.0,"We didn't do all the palaces of Seoul, but if you are going to do one of them it should be this one. Not on the scale of Forbidden City in Beijing, but still very impressive.  Again very cheap entry fee, free 1 hour tour guides in different languages which was very informative, and the changing of the guard which is definitely worth the wait (many of these throughout the day) and great for photo ops with historical dressed soldiers.  Next to this are 2 museums (Folk and the Palace museum). Both are interesting and depends if you have time in your schedule. Folk is included in Palace ticket."
1817,5.0,"Very interesting place with many things to see. To hire a guide would not be a bad idea, otherwise one can read all in the travel guide."
1818,5.0,"Superb architecture. Very interesting mix of buildings, gardens and temples. It has a good restaurant and is just besides a metro station."
1819,3.0,"It was supposed to be grand but despite the vastness and a couple of displays of the old settings of the palace, I came away without feeling impressed. It did cross my mind what a big place for the workers to get from place to place in the compound."
1820,5.0,The area is immaculately preserved. They also make it so tourist friendly with the free Hanbok wearing and the changing of the guards ceremony for show.
1821,4.0,"If you are just going to Seoul for shopping, I'll say you may not like going to these historical places which can be a little dry.  But it's highly recommended especially for 1st time visitors to take some time off to read, see and learn how is the history like and how much hv been destroyed after the war. Take your time to stroll the gardens to take the city stress away. Try on the guards uniform for a fun photo taking at no costs.  Every country's historical buildings are to be respected for what they have been through with time. So we think its not a fair comparison to compare the different palaces. Just have an open mind to learn more of what was recorded during that era."
1822,4.0,Make sure you do not miss the exchange of guards which start around 10am. It is almost an hour show and worth watching. Take note that this takes place outside Gyeongbokgung and you need not purchase a ticket to watch this!
1823,5.0,"This palace is a ""must see"" for any trip to Seoul. The surroundings are absolutely beautiful with mountains in the background, manicured gardens and fish ponds. You can experience how the royal family used to live hundreds of years ago and then step out the gate into downtoen Seoul. Walking shoes a good idea due to the large area to be covered and the uneven surface area (ancient paving stones, not concrete). The changing of the guard ceremony also interesting as well as the exhibits of life in ancient Korea."
1824,4.0,"There are a couple of palaces in Seoul. Both are different enough to enjoy separately, but you must see at least one."
1825,5.0,"Gyungbok Palace was used as a King's place during Joseon dynasty. You can feel Korean royal family's life and there living standard. Also, you can enjoy beautiful nature in Gyungbok Palace. Don't forget other palaces around Gyungbok Palace like Changduk Palace or Changgyung Palace."
1826,4.0,plenty of phoyo opportunities with guards changing and the buildings and you can try on a uniform and watz around its very funny and worth doing and as always everyone is friendly
1827,4.0,Prepare for a long walk if we want to explore the whole areas. The whole were very clean and well-maintained. The palaces have colorful detail and interesting pattern on many parts of them.
1828,4.0,"We visited the palace as a family on a Sunday morning and spent appr 2 hours here. As has been mentioned in many reviews, a lot of parts of this palace are rebuilt due to destruction suffered during Japanese occupation. Nevertheless, it remains very impressive. Since we had our two children with us (10 and 15) we didn't opt for any tours (they tend to get bored easily) but just wandered around the grounds. There were plenty of information tablets near all major sites and all were available in English so no language barrier there. We arrived at appr. 10.50 and were able to take some shots of the kids with the colourful guards in front of the palace. The changing of the guards on the hour made for a lovely video shot. Once inside the gate the ticket booths were located towards the right hand side. When we went in there were only 2-3 people queuing in front of us so no delays in purchasing tickets. The grounds are huge so you can easily spend some hours just wandering about, taking scenic shots (and have them taken by Koreans of you as well!). We had a coffee outside the cafe in the sun which was lovely and priced similarly to the rest of Seoul. Overall a great place to start your sightseeing. Very easy to do and beautiful shots to get. I would make sure you go in good weather though since virtually all of it is outside (you will only be able to look inside the buildings from windows)."
1829,4.0,"Wow ... What a great piece of architecture ad restoration. This palace is the largest and one of 5 palaces in Seoul. I joined a tour and this was one of the inclusions.  It was good to have someone explain all the history and show me through. Wonderful colors and history.  Look out for the changing of the guards - a parade of wonderful costumes, sounds and pagentary. Lots of people scrambling to get photos but wait until the end and you will get shots of guards leaving .  I wish I had more time as tour only allocated an hour which also include the national folk museum. This is a must see if you have limited time. The other palace I saw was very similar ad I don't think it's worth doing two palaces."
1830,4.0,"It was amazing to see how totality lived... And there day to day habits. The architecture is a sight to behold. I was amazing to see how Japan and chime ha influence in the way they developed there land and also to know that korea has been invaded by both but still in the end Korea fought through. Even if your not big into history the views, plant life, and entertainment is enough to take up your whole day. Don't forget to see the changing of the guards. And for 3,000 won you can't beat that... Plus free admittance to the national folk museum right next door."
1831,4.0,"I liked the fact that this complex was restored very well. Though it suffered a lot of damages due to the war and the Japanese occupation, I found this royal palace to be a more sober and enjoyable example compared to Beijing's Forbiddne City. More information available in english, less crowded, and very clean"
1832,5.0,"Well kept, vibrant and well preserved. You will enjoy an afternoon stroll here and definitely enjoy visiting the museums. Nice souvenirs and reasonably priced. They have great views to take pictures of and is one of the palaces that you would think of revising."
1833,5.0,"This is the #1 palace to see if you can only see one. Highly recommend the tour. Only a few english tours a day, so check your guide book or the website for schedule. If you can't make the tour, pick up a pamphlet at the information office, there isn't any signage on the grounds explaining what anything is. Changing of the guard happens every hour on the hour, that's worth seeing. Also recommend the integrated palaces ticket if you plan to visit a lot of palaces. It's a good value and saves the standing in line at every palace to buy tickets."
1834,4.0,"Although most of the buildings are rebuilt in recent years, there are various guard changing ceremonies held throughout the day. at 11am 1pm and 3pm there is a procession with drums and music and at 2pm and 4pm is a simpler guard changing ceremony."
1835,4.0,"this is the also one of the ""must see"" place when you go on city tour, at front of Sejong King Statue, go on there at 10.00 then you will see the guard changing ceremony, and after that you can taken your picture with them, it was great,,,"
1836,4.0,Too bad that we went here in the afternoon that is why we missed the changing of guards. What I really like the most is the big landscape of the palace and the mountain views in the palace. When we where there the small room in the middle of the lake reminds me of Moon embraces the sun. I really want to go there but it is restricted to visitors. We were already tired at the time when we visited this palace so we spent a little time in here.
1837,5.0,The name translates as the Palace of Shining Happiness. This palace has survived a lot of wars and rulers making is historical site a representation of how strong korea is as a nation and it's citizenry. The interesting folk museum and palace museum is housed here including beautiful traditional korean gardens. When in gyeongbogkung you must witness the royal changing of the guards that happens every hour from 10am - 3pm and of course have photos with the korean guards as well
1838,4.0,"The main attraction of going to Gyeongbokgung is to watch the changing of the guards. They say it is historically accurate, complete with exchange of passwords and stuff. It’s best to time your visit to watch the changing of the guards, and then go on the free guided tour which I think runs every hour. The tour guide gave lots of interesting information about the architectural features of the palace, like why there are three “lanes” going into the palace from the gates, or how the palace is heated during the winter months. She also gave told us a bit of history of Korea, the palace and the kings that occupied it. Overall it was 2 hours well spent.  If you’re into walking a lot, Gyeongbokgung is walking distance from Insadong, Jongmyeo Shrine, Changdeokgung Palace, Gwanghwamun Square and Cheonggyecheon Stream. So from Gyeongbokgung there are quite a number of choices of places you can go to."
1839,5.0,Visited Gyeongbokgung late November so it was starting to get chilly. It is easily accessed via the Gyeongbokgung Palace station on Seoul Subway line 3. We were able to catch the Changing of the Guards. Don't forget to take tons of photos with the guards and the lovely red and yellow foliage.
1840,4.0,Easy access from subway. The exit/entrance from subway was decorated to have a feel of the historic palace. A palace with cluster dwellings for the palace workers. Beautiful architecture and carvings made for good photography. They have a procession of guards at certain time of the day. They have FREE guides done by students in English! You can see them in their bright orange jacket. A few other museum around the palace grounds. This place is huge! Take us a few hours to cover the whole ground. Only our hunger for lunch stop us from covering the whole ground. There's a cafe in the museum building to have hot coffee. We head to Insadong for lunch which is nearby across the street. Visited in December 2012.
1841,4.0,"Imagine large palace with interesting stories behind them.... hence, it'll be good if you manage to catch a guide that gives free tour at regular interval.  Be sure to get there before 4pm or so (please check closing timing as it differs time to time) as ticketing close an hour before closing time... we missed it by ten minutes during our first trip there :(  There's a National Palace Museum at the side with some interesting displays, taking about an hour or less to finish viewing, a good side visit if you have some time on hand,... or happened to missed the ticketing time (like us)"
1842,4.0,"The palace offers free guided tour (first one for English starts 11am) but unfortunately the timing was not right for us. We were told that there are uni students giving free tours of the palace as well but we could not locate them. That was why we decided to rent an audio guide for 3,000won. The content was informative but if you don't mind reading, I recommend that you skip the audio guide and go for the free guide book that you can find once you enter the ticketed entrance. The written guide comes with illustration & pictures, to give you a better idea on what to look out for.  The palace is very accessible. We took the metro to Gyeongbukgong metro stop. One of the exits will lead you straight to the palace. The palace wasn't very crowded when we first got there at 9am, but the crowds started to stream in by the time we left at 1pm.  The buildings in the palace are small but the palace grounds is quite large. Note that many of the buildings are restored works rather than originals. The landscaping looked nice and left me desiring ti want to see it in spring & autumn."
1843,4.0,"With so many palace around, we decided to just go to this one. The entrance fees is pretty cheap. Took and audio guide too, but found it not necessary as there is a free English guided tour. Remember to go see the guard changing ceremony."
1844,5.0,The in-house guide was great and informative! She was also passionate about what she was telling us. I now understand the Koreans grief over losing their royalty because of the deeds of the Japanese.
1845,4.0,"It's quite an experience to really step into a historic Palace where most people only view them in dramas. Kind of crowded in the morning. They have a ceremony at specific timings where there's music and guards ""marching"".  It's a huge palace. When we are there, some little parts are undergoing construction. But we still enjoy our trip there."
1846,3.0,"We enjoyed the beauty of this. Unfortunately, when we went it was cold and I don't think we gave the palace due justice. There isn't much to do, but we also had our son and were not able to spend a good amount of time taking a tour or audio tour. I am certainly glad we saw this beautiful palace though."
1847,5.0,"This was the first site we visited in Seoul. We joined the English tour, which took a little more than an hour. The palace gave tremendous insight into the prevailing culture and principles of the Joseon dynasty. I was impressed that, unlike other palaces, there was no emphasis on excess and luxury. Instead, they had a stream for purifying the mind, simple dwelling places for the royal family, and even a quiet place for the king to reflect. The buildings were big, but relatively austere.  After the tour, we watched the changing of the guard ceremony at the Gwanghamun Gate. This happens hourly from 10am to 3pm, so you can catch it before or after the tour. Entrance to the palace costs KRW3000 (less than UD$3), tours are free."
1848,4.0,"Where do i start? I kinda got lost inside the palace, I was walking somewhere I think is suppose to be the servant's area and I have no idea where i am by the time i notice i was lost. It is really nice place to have a look. and Just a tip, bring along a water bottle and a cap if you are going around noon, you would need that :)"
1849,4.0,"Visiting the Palace during Chuseok just added to the experience. There were people dressed in traditional costumes, dancers, and special events going on in the children's section, including traditional games. The Palace wasn't crowded, we were able to roam around and take lots of pictures. The Palace is easy to get to, and there is a money exchange inside which is very helpful. Be sure to give yourself enough time to walk to all the different sections. One of my favorites was the replication of a village from the 1940's, including the comic book shop. I would recommend that you either eat before going to the Palace, or take some snacks with you. It is so big that it takes several hours to see everything. There are places to fill your water bottle and the bathrooms were clean."
1850,5.0,"Gyeongbok Palace has to be the number one attraction in Seoul. I never get tired of watching the changing of the guard, the changing of the leaves, or the changing faces of the tourists from all aover the world who flock to its grounds. A vast expense of land in the center of Seoul yours for exploring at your own leasure without too much interference from low key museum staff. Take a camera of course and be prepared to walk away with hundreds of wonderful compositions from magnificant architectural roofs to detailed close-ups of ancient fixtures and doors. Well worth spending a half a day exploring preceded by and with a follow on late lunch or early dinner. High noon is the spectacle of spectacles with the changing of the guards, so don;t miss it. One of many palaces in and around Seoul but in my humble opinion the best preserved and most professionaly presented and maintained."
1851,3.0,"Went here during the obligatory tourist day of a business trip to Seoul.  We watched the changing of the guard shortly after arriving at 10. A few people brightly dressed as traditional korean warriors marched around a bit but didn't really do much else.  Pretty impressive overall though and a fairly large complex to explore. We had a group tour guide who was full of interesting information about the place, which brought it to life a bit more.  Some of it is original but much has been extensively restored, but done in a sympathetic manor.  I guess it depends how much you like this sort of place but we took about 1.5 hours to see all the major bits of the complex and I thought that was enough."
1852,4.0,"i was here on a sunday in October,the weather was quite warm for me but the sun are real big.remember to bring your sunglasses or you won't be able to open your eyes to see the historical building which are still colourful and well maintained.please be prepare that you will need to walk quite a lot,plus taking photo,watch the shift changing of the palace guard.the palace closed on Monday so take note if you are planning to go there."
1853,5.0,"The sheer enormity of Gyeongbokgung Palace can be a bit daunting, but I do encourage anyone visiting Seoul to take a few hours to wander through the grounds of this amazing palace.  After passing through Gwanghwamun Gate (the main gate of the palace, which is itself enormous and visually stunning, especially as it is lit up at night), there are many structures to walk through within the temple's vast walls, along with amazing courtyards, pavilions, statues and traditional Korean gardens. Each gate and doorway passed through provides new and wonderful sights to take in. The temple's vibrant color scheme of teal, red, purple and orange -- seemingly standard throughout most if not all of Korea's temples and palaces -- is a delight to behold.  The National Folk Museum of Korea, as well as the National Palace Museum of Korea, are also located within its walls, and tours are available for both.  The palace is very easy to get to, with close access to the subway and bus routes, and seems surprising and almost out of place in the middle of such a busy city. But once inside its impressive walls, one can quickly forget that you're in a bustling, modern city and allow yourself to be transported to a different and distant time.  Although it attracts a lot of tourists, I highly recommend spending a few hours visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace -- you won't be disappointed. And if you can visit on a weekday the crowds will be far fewer."
1854,5.0,"I'm in awe with the size and scale of this palace. I'm also so very happy I dropped the 3000 Won for the audio guide. It was highly informative and provided me with a much richer experience than if I'd just bumbled through the place. For a moment I stopped to listen to the free tour and it seemed quite worthwhile, too, providing even more color than the audio guide. I would recommended it if you're into a slightly more structured walk. My favorite part? Hyangwonejong in the back - a phenomenally beautiful pagoda and pond. I could have spent hours there."
1855,5.0,"This is the meaning of the word Gyeongbokgung and it fits the palace so well. I arranged for a two day stopover in Seoul and checked online for places of interest. This was on the top of my list. I arrived in Seoul and stayed at the Sky Hotel which had free shuttle service and was two blocks from the metro for downtown Seoul. Excellent location!!! Took the metro to the Palace and arrived just in time for the changing of the guards which was absolutely beautiful and very entertaining with music, costumes, drums, marching bands, etc. I enjoyed it so much that after I toured the palace and grounds, I stayed for the next guard change which is on the hour. The Seoul metro makes it very easy to get around the city and it is very reasonable also. Two days was enough time to see most of the important sights of the city. Food was delicious esp. the area called the Samcheongdong with its wonderful street food. Also went to the Jeongdong theatre for the ""Miso"" showing (full house). You can take a city bus tour (hop on, hop off) for only ten US dollars, I real bargain!!!"
1856,5.0,"Very conveniently located with its own subway stop this is a great place to walk around in the fall or spring when the weather is comfortable. Lots to see and plenty of space to switch your legs while admiring the amazing architecture,"
1857,4.0,the garden and compound is so huge the lines for the entrance ticket were long great architecture  wear covered or rubber shoes as there will be a lot of walking from one palace/room to another its quite dusty in spring (i visited them in spring)
1858,4.0,Typical palaces as in similarities to the ones in other cities like Beijing. It has a very big compound so walking end to end is quite a distance so prepare to have good walking shoes.
1859,4.0,"Went there on a biz trip in Jan 11. Client organized local tour which of cuz, couldn't missed out the magnificent palace. Maybe it was my first encounter with winter weather and it was freezingly cold to walk on the snow (lots and lots of walking) and I didn't get to enjoy the scenery due to the coldness. Hence, be prepared to put on heat pack and extremely thick socks with boots before going there!"
1860,5.0,I strolled through this palace. It was interesting. Well kept. Changing of the guard was very enjoyable.
1861,4.0,"Went to the Palace to get a feel of Seoul. By chance just got there as the guard was changing - it's quite a spectacle with falgs, banners and unusual uniforms - it was quite fascinating. The paalce complex is ok, a bit like a small Forbidden City and it certainly gives you the feeling of how grand it must have been"
1862,5.0,"A much more compact place than the Changdeogung Palace but main buidlings-wise, more or less comparable. But what sets it apart is the secret garden area which gives you a good impression of what it was like hundereds of years ago. Most buildings here are original and not rebuild as in the other places. Do take the English tour because it gives so much inside info on this attraction. A plus !"
1863,5.0,The palace is super big.... I couldn't finish exploring the palace during my one hour visit. Was too tired and had to back...
1864,4.0,"Wear comfortable walking shoes and bring a bottle of water. Be prepared for the often dusty areas paved with gravel. There are many steps to climb without handrails in order to see inside many of the palace rooms. Allow time to do a guided walking tour with English speaking tour guides. There's a sign at the gathering place inside the palace grounds for the scheduled tours, which are free.  Please read the other reviews of this palace. I agree with most of them, and don't want to repeat."
1865,3.0,"We arrived at Gyeongbokgung Palace around lunch time, it was very hot and too much glare from the sun. Maybe its better to go in the afternoon and in time for the English-speaking tour guide but there are free English booklets that you can read while walking around the palace.  There is also the Gogungddurak museum shop and cafe where we had our lunch."
1866,4.0,"The palace itself and surrounding are beautiful, but in my opinion the park behind is beautiful, with artifitial lake and great deep green. Try to get on late afternoon, when sun starts to set down and enjoy great play of colors"
1867,5.0,"Impressive architecture with the National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum on the grounds as well. Time your visit to witness the changing of the guard and be sure to see the gardens in the rear of the palace, especially the lovely Hyangwonjeong pavilion. The combination ticket for all the palaces in Seoul, including the Secret Garden and Jongmyo Shrine is well worth it if you plan on seeing more than 3 of the sites."
1868,4.0,"This is the one of the place you need to visit when your holidays in South Korea.You can explore by yourself and it take 2 to 3 hrs to complete this area. The entrance fees is around 2,400 Won.You can bring along bottle of drinks and cap if you visit summer season as the place is big for your to explore where you can snap beautiful view either the traditional palaces or lake.You also can try their traditional dress for snap photos with free fees. The best is when you arrive in you can see the changing guard with some of traditional music. We also can snap photos with the guard when they are on duty.Please don't miss this place in your holidays itinarary."
1869,5.0,Beautiful and very nicely programmed in the summer. Took out of town guests there on the weekend and the museum was free. It was a delight to see all the extra performances.
1870,5.0,All visitors to Seoul should stop by this palace. Very amazed by the grandeur of the structures and the beauty of the architecture. Be sure to come on a cooler day as we visited during a heat wave and found ourselves dripping with sweat. Also do not make the mistake of spending too much time at the main gate and the first palace building as it is only a small part of the overall complex.
1871,4.0,The palace is completely rebuilt and it is worth a visit to understand Seoul's past. There is a great guards ceremony every our in the main entrance
1872,5.0,Loved the palace and worth visiting. definitely go there and its not far from the city centre. I took tons of pictures here which i enjoy doing. At the entrance the guards are all dressed up in traditional old uniforms which was nice to see.
1873,4.0,"Been here twice and still think that's this is the most interesting attraction in Seoul, other then the shopping. The place will take u back to the olden days in Korea. It would be great if u can get a guide to explain the features within this palace to get a better understanding."
1874,3.0,"One sparsely adorned pavilion after another. No tree cover at all; it is scorching hot under the summer sun. If you don't want to expand the energy or have limited time, skip this tourist trap."
1875,5.0,The famous palace here... A must see for every tourist! Vast area inside... I wonder how many servants the King has inside the palace grounds!?!?!
1876,5.0,"The Palace is very big, and nice to walk around. While you can find the performance schedule of 'changing soldiers' every day. Very impressive performance - you will see the soldiers wearing Korean traditional costumes marching with Korean music, and at the end of the performance, you can take photos with the soldiers!!"
1877,5.0,the changing of the guards is what makes this palace different from other palaces. very colourful
1878,5.0,"This is my favorite of all the palaces in Seoul! The buildings are beautiful...there is so much to see. The changing of the guard ceremony is something not to be missed. My favorite spot is the small pond in the way back of the grounds.(Hyangwon-jeong) The day we were there, there we lilly pads in the pod. The pictures we took of the pond, gazebo and mountain in the background were breathtaking!"
1879,5.0,"This palace, and its neighbor to the East, is beautifully restored and well worth visiting. You can enter some of the buildings.  Recommended: Take a free, guided tour, either from the Palace (times posted upon entry) or by reserving one at the Korean Tourist Agency (http://www.visitseoul.net/).  Hidden treat: National Folk Museum of Korea is at the NE corner of the palace, and is excellent, with free guided tours."
1880,4.0,"The palace is pretty big, though once you have visited one palace, the rest looks pretty much similiar. Though they tell a different story. And so a guided tour helps or the guide booklet that is made available at the palance entrance. There are various activites that happens within the grounds of the palace. Depending on the time of the day, you will be able to experience the changing of guards at the entrance of the palace. There are some family oriented activities available within the palace vicinity as well.  The amazing thing about the palace is that it sits beautifully against Mount Namsan and the Han River."
1881,3.0,"Nice touch of Korean history walking the grounds. Nestled in the heart of Seoul, this is very accessible. But it is not on the scale of the Forbidden City - and definitely worth visiting. There were the colourful guards marching around and they even wandered off into the business district outside the palace walls. Nice sight."
1882,4.0,"This place is larger than I had imagined, but it is quite the place to see. The museum is also attached to the grounds. The changing of the guards is quite th scene."
1883,4.0,This is the biggest of all the palaces and the most well-preserved.
1884,5.0,"The changing of the guard was enjoyable. The museum is also worth taking in and walking around the ground, is a nice way of spending an afternoon."
1885,4.0,touristy guard change during the guard but well worth getting a photo of
1886,4.0,"Yes, this palace has been reconstructed but the innovative South Koreans had no alternative if they wanted to rightly showcase their proud history.  The guards at the main gate were incredibly still as tourists posed beside them.  The 1100 changing of the guard was impressive: much music amid solemn ceremony and marching.  The Palace's reconstructed buildings occupy a large area. Reconstruction is ongoing with some traditional cottages being built.  The entrance fee (KRW3000 was particularly good value). One can combine this with a visit to the free National Folk Museum.  Don't come on Tuesdays: it is closed."
1887,4.0,"One of several major palaces in downtown Seoul; once you've had a guided tour of one you will recognize the main features of the others. I'd avoid the audio tour for this one, though; the equipment is very temperamental and the sound keeps cutting out."
1888,5.0,Easy to get to by the subway - Gwanghwamun Station on Line 5. You walk out the station and there is a statue of King Sejong- past the statue is the Palace with the guards in uniform. Worth visiting for a look at a bygone era and existence.
1889,4.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is close to the city center is thus the most frequented by tour groups. Visit early in the morning to avoid the crowds. The National Folk Museum of Korea is connected to the complex, so visit this as well when you're in the area."
1890,4.0,Loved the changing of the guards! Afterwards we were invited to take pictures with the guards who were very patient with the many tourists.
1891,5.0,Great view into Korean history. Do the self guided audio tour or join a live tour. Well worth it.
1892,4.0,"Compared to the palaces in Beijing, Gyeongbokgung Palace are not that impressive as a whole. But there are some interesting parts in the palace that are awe-inspiring. Its big moat in the middle of the palace & the changing of the guards are just a few of it."
1893,4.0,"the palace is intersting to visit if you would like to see one of the Korean palaces. However, the palace is not original and has been rebuilt recently, which explains the good quality and freshness of the painting."
1894,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace (景福宮)... the most Beautiful Palace ever !! Myself and with 6 other of my girl-friends are first time visit palace. We manage watching the colourful changing of the guards on time at around 10am and walked around for about 2 hours.  Admission Fees : Adults 3000 won (Closed on Tuesday)  getting there by subway : 1. Use exit #5 of Gyeongbokgung Station (Subway Line #3), 2. From Exit #2 of Ganghwamun Station (Subway Line #5), walk 400 meters"
1895,3.0,"One of five palaces in Seoul, it has been fully restored. It's a large fenced complex with many different buildings. Most of the buildings cannot be entered, but some, including the throne room, have the doors open so you can see inside. Do take the video tour, it has a built in GPS so the narration automatically starts as you approach each viewing point. The changing of the guards, every hour on the hour, is colourful and worth seeing. My favourite parts were the stone animal statues and the large pavilion set in the water.  Probably not interesting to small children as there's a lot of walking and not much to do."
1896,5.0,It seems like they have a lot of students going there for field trips
1897,5.0,"It is a huge palace complex that you can wander around. It's a great way to spend a nice afternoon outside. If you are visiting, to see some well maintained or restored traditional palace buildings. I would say it is a definite must to see at least one of the palaces if you are visiting South Korea. For those that live here, you should have been to one by now."
1898,4.0,"I'm not a history or culture enthusiast, but visiting Seoul is not complete if you dont visit all those palaces. It's nice because it was my first timer, what you expect will be the colourful unique designs. Excellent for photo taking and memorable photo of Seoul trip. nothing much to see and expect on the changing of guard , just a procession with colourful guard marching and playing traditional musical instruments. easily accessible by subways (Gwanghamon or Geongbukgung st)."
1899,4.0,"great for learning about korean culture, architecture is nice too. it is massive, so recommend visiting when youve got some energy!"
1900,4.0,"Good for learning Korean culture for those who is very curious and interested but to some it will be boring and tiring. When I went there, a ceremonial parade was taken place where there are Koreans who wear hanbok so we took a lot of pictures, you'll see different kind of old building of Korean Monarchy."
1901,4.0,"This palace is a great place to visit to get a glimpse of Korea's history. Definitely get an audio guide if you do not take a guided tour. Without the background information, you are likely to miss out on a lot of key facts."
1902,4.0,"This was a great half day trip. The history was interesting, the grounds are nice and inside is the folk museum. If the weather is nice, take a picnic."
1903,2.0,"If you have seen any European, Chinese, or Japanese palaces/temples, this will be a bit of a let down. The architecture is nice enough, but there very little interest-holding power here. Nicest thing about the place is the mountains in the background.  Thronging with tourists as well, not a MUST SEE if I'm honest."
1904,5.0,"Ponds, nooks, crannies, pavillions, surprises, ....its all here. The changing of the guard is quite a ceremony so don't miss it. Check with tourist office(s) to find out the daily schedule (depends on time of year of visit)."
1905,5.0,"If you are short on time, and only have one palace to visit while you are in Seoul. I really recommend Gyeongbokgung Palace to be your pick. It has an extensive ground. They layout is great and easy to navigate through and the buildings are so beautiful. I was just in time to see the cherry blossoms still in bloom. It is a beautiful and serene place. A must see on my list of things to see while you are in Korea."
1906,5.0,"Visited this and CheongDuk Gung. We liked this one better--more spacious, more impressive. Terrific gift shop at the adjacent Folk Museum. Didn't stop to take a photo in traditional costume but it looked fun."
1907,4.0,"The grounds of this palace was just stunning and huge. Free guided tours are provided in several languages. A children's museum and an art museum are also here. I was expecting to be here for about an hour, but ended up spending 3-4 hours here."
1908,5.0,If you only have time to visit one palace in Seoul make sure it is this one. It is absolutely spectacular and you could easily spend a whole day there. The first day I went it poured with rain so went back a week or so later on a sunny day with blossom starting to appear. Just spectacular in a large city.
1909,5.0,The big palace in Capital city of Choseon dinasty were devided by the political reason in early 1900's. Gyeingokgung is the main core place of that big palace and there is the historical spot where Korean last Empress got assasinated by Japanese Yakuja during the termoil era...
1910,4.0,"I think that one visiting Korea should not miss this place. It is in the heart of the city and very near other must see places like Gwanghamun park and the Blue Mansion. We got to see the changing of the Palace guards which is another good experience. The place covers a vast area and considerable time is needed to go around it. There was also free admission in the National Folk Museum which was also very educational. It might be very helpful though if they placed some historical description on each palace and not only on the entrances. Still, it is a must see for me."
1911,4.0,history + scenery = awesome. u'll regret if u dont visit this palace.. a very huge palace.. u can see guard ceremony every hours :)
1912,4.0,A beautifully preserved traditional architecture in the center of modern Seoul. Its gardens and lakes are picturesque spots that will provide perfect shooting locations for photography enthusiasts. Take advantage of the free hanbok wearing at the souvenir shop!
1913,5.0,Very nice place. Apart from the Palace it is also a park with a great view of mountains.
1914,5.0,love the tour guide...she explained everything in detail..do check out the time for the free tour guide...we managed to get more than 10 people to save 600won for the entrance fee..it will be great if you can get more than 10 people and the ticket will be 2400 won ;)
1915,5.0,"With or without the cherry blossoms, the palace site is one beautiful place you must visit when you are in Korea. Colorful palace guard clothes and flags compliment the intricate design of the roofs of their halls and gates. The vast space makes it good for strolling/roaming around while holding the hands of the one you love and occasionally sneak a kiss or two. :) There are many tourists here but with how huge the site is, you definitely can find a private place where you can sit down and have a heart-to-heart conversation amid the pavilions, lake, and the beautiful backdrop of the Bugak Mountain."
1916,5.0,"If you only have time to visit one palace in Seoul, visit this one. It's big, elegant, and fun to walk around. You can also visit the national folk museum from there. Plan to spend about 2 hrs there... It's the nicest one in that area thrust me."
1917,5.0,"Part of planning our itinerary for the day is looking up the different attractions clustered in one area, say Hongdae area. My friend and I decided to dedicate one day to do a 'cultural' tour. We planned on going to a couple of the palaces in Seoul, as well as a museum or two.  Gyeongbokgung Palace comes highly recommended in different Korean travel sites. It is the main palace in the Joseon dynasty. Anyway, we chose to get there before 1:30 PM so we can join the English guided tour of the palace.  The place was already packed with tourists and locals alike. There were different tour groups as well, but the place was big enough that it didn't feel crowded. We paid 3,000 Won each for admission into the palace.  The tour guide spoke English but with a very distinct Korean accent. Being exposed to the Korean English a lot more than my friend, I found it easier to 'understand' compared to my friend. The guide was very knowledgeable and inserted some anecdotes into her tour.  The tour lasted for one hour, but we weren't able to cover everything, so we were left to explore the rest of the compound.  There was also a Royal Changing of the Guards (I think) ceremony as we were leaving.  The reason why I suggest you start your Cultural tour here is that you won't need a tour guide for the other palaces since they are basically set up in a similar fashion.  Restorations are currently being done on some other part of the compound."
1918,3.0,This is a must see in Seoul! There are about 5 or 6 palaces... this is by far the best one! There is also a free tour in English everyday. I believe the tour is around 2p.m. Check their website to make sure though. Have a great time!
1919,4.0,I think this is the main palace out of all the palaces you can visit in Seoul. The architecture is impressive and well-preserved. We walked around the huge ground for an hour and a half and visited the different halls.
1920,5.0,"I have been there a few times already and it never gets boring! A great place to visit for a day, also for a picnic. Very well maintained . Don't miss the show at the entrance of the palace, it feels like going back in time! There is one part of the palace that you need to book at least a day before you visit, if you don't you cannot get in. Absolutely loved it!"
1921,3.0,Was a nice 3 hours looking around this relatively new copy of this 600 year old Palace.
1922,2.0,"I would not make a special visit to this palace. Both the architecture and the palace ground is uninteresting. The National Folklore Museum is equally dry. (I personally found the exhibits very creepy. May because I am Chinese and a bit superstitious.} However if you are in the area you should not miss the interesting local designer shops, cafes and creative houses in the intricate lane ways east of Samcheongdonggil. If you were here around dinner time there are also numerous restaurants to choose from along this picturesque road."
1923,4.0,"The guided tour was great. If you miss the schedule, they do have audio guide equipment for loan. It also offers free Korean clothing try-on service, so make sure your ask for the location before heading in."
1924,3.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace has been under a restoration process for some years and so far a lot of the buildings have now been outwardly restored. The contents of some are still to be placed. The site is huge so good walking shoes a must, and it does get hot here so plenty of water.... Not many places to get food or drink on-site. The Palace certainly opens your eyes to how things used to be"
1925,4.0,"Highly tourist-ed but a great and easy see in the center of Seoul. Enjoy the walk around the Palace grounds (not a huge amount to see) then be sure to enjoy a bit the plethora of restaurants and drinking establishments (Hofs) around the area. When the smoke drives you coughing from one restaurant or bar (or every one), a walk along the canal is nice!"
1926,4.0,"Vast grounds and beautiful foliage, this place will give you a historical lesson of Seoul in the past"
1927,5.0,You can spend a good few hours here if you really looked at everything in detail and walk to every section of the palace.  There's a free guided tour (different languages at varying times) available but this is after you buy your entry ticket into the palace (3000 won).  You can't go into any of the buildings but there's some that you can look inside with a description in front.  The changing of the guard is definitely worth seeing as well and occurs every hour.  You really need to walk around the palace to appreciate why some people who worked in the palace in the olden days never even saw the king once the entire time!!
1928,4.0,"It's the biggest and most well known palace in Korea. How long you stay there is up to you. You could blow through it in an hour, with the pamphlet and a camera or you could stay there for hours with a guided tour. My biggest complaint about any palace in Korea is that they are INCREDIBLY well maintained, so they sometimes lose that feeling of history and age with every coat of fresh paint they slap on, but I have lived here 3 years and they are still pretty amazing sites. They are huge complexes in the center of one of the worlds largest cities and they really give you an idea of what life was like in Korea ages ago. Fall is the most beautiful time to go because it is not too hot and the fall colors actually make it even more gorgeous than in spring (aIs surprising as it sounds). It also gives you really beautiful views of the mountains, the Blue House where the President lives and it is quite large. It might be difficult for kids that are too small because you just look at things, you cant really interact or enter buildings, but kids above the age of 7 I'm sure would find a way to enjoy it. It's perfect if you are taking family visiting Korea, if you are a family visiting Korea, teens, friends or couples."
1929,5.0,The Korean government is currently reconstructing the buildings of this palace. Before the Japanese ocupation the palace had 800 buildings; during the occupation all but 10 buildings were torn down. The project to restore Gyeongbokgung is a fifty year project; half the project has already been completed. The reconstruction has been made difficult by urban expansion. The work done so far is very impressive and I look forward to seeing Gyeongbokgung in all its glory in the future.
1930,5.0,"Though buildings are extensively reconstructed, it is enjoyable to wander around and immerse oneself in the historic architecture of a bygone Korea."
1931,5.0,"we were only in Seoul for 27 hours, but we managed to visit this palace. It was definitely worth the visit, it is very easy to get to, picturesque, and the changing of the guards is very cool!"
1932,5.0,"This became one of the highlights of our tour, not only because of the Palace and grounds, but also we got to try on a traditional Korean costume!  First, the Palace and grounds ... the area was bigger than I expected and had a bit of a tiring walk to explore, but I didn't mind because this meant it didn't seem to be as crowded. The Palace and other buildings were majestic and I liked the feeling of history it brought for me. We arrived there at around 3PM, which was perfect timing because we witnessed the ""guard"" show. Not sure if it was meant to be a changing of the guards, or a reenactment of a historical event (I wasn't paying attention when they announced it) but I did enjoy the show.  Then there's the traditional Korean costume. As we explored, we noticed a sign beside the coffee shop showing some traditional costumes. Turns out that they allow you to try on a traditional Korean costume! And it's for free! But when we got there, they already had quite a long waiting list and couldn't accommodate us anymore. So my friends and I went back early the next morning, just so we could experience this. The costume place opens at 10AM, and they allow you to have it on for about 15 minutes, in which time you can explore around in costume in nearby areas to give you the perfect photo opp. :-)"
1933,5.0,"Bring a camera. You'll find lots of beautiful pictures. It is large, so be prepared for a lot of walking. You can buy a little box that describes what you are seeing in several languages. Enjoy!"
1934,4.0,Its really nice. It reminded me of the Korean soap operas. When you're inside you will imagine how life was like in the old times. The place is very clean and well kept.
1935,4.0,"Visit one and you got the idea of how it look like all. Pretty bland and less ornaments compare to palaces in Japan. But its Korean humbleness who win peoples heart. Humble, pure and tradition above all."
1936,5.0,"The palace is clean and there is a wonderful performance on changing of guards at certain time of the day. However, there are a lot of tourists in the palace and it is therefore very crowded."
1937,4.0,Very nice palace. Unfortunately the interior is shown only on small maps and not with open windows to let you look inside. Palace guards are very helpful with foreigners
1938,4.0,"Between Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung, i prefer Gyeongbokgung, as there is more to see and the secenary was much better.  There is also the guard changing ceremony that happens every hours in front of the palace and if u want have some good food. At Gyeongbokgung station exit 2 there is Tosokchon (토속촌) the famous Samgyetang shop which even the president of korea patronises.  So all in all a good all round place to visit."
1939,3.0,was having a high hope when coming over to checkout the palace. When we arrive it is a bit of disappointing as it look bit barren / empty.  if you're visiting here on summer i suggest to visit here in the evening as the sun is too hot to move around.  there is a museum nearby which the access is free of charge :)
1940,4.0,Take the free tour. Really worth the 1 hour time. You will be given time to take photos.
1941,4.0,"I am quite surprise when I reached this palace. I don't have much expectation as I thought this is just a palace with buildings and garden. What surprise me is the surrounding scenery. What a beautiful place! I went there during autumn, and the leaves are so beautiful, especially the scenery near the lake. The ticket is quite cheap. Worth visiting!"
1942,4.0,"Gyeongbukgung is the crown jewel of Seoul's collection of royal palaces, with complete access at no more than a few US dollars. You could honestly spend all day wandering its huge expanse, there's just so much history there and so many different styles of architecture to appreciate as well. Besides the main pavilions, I recommend seeing the Hyangwonjeong Pavilion towards the north gate and the Gyeonghoeru (Royal Banquet Hall), set on water. But honestly, its worth it to just take your time and wander through the whole thing leisurely and read the posted information along the way. I loved Gyeongbukgung so much I went twice during my trip! On a side note, do not miss either the National Palace Museum (separate 1,000W admission) or National Folk Museum attached to Gyeongbukgung."
1943,2.0,good museums within. but you can tell it is just too touristy. not ORIGINAL
1944,4.0,"Very cheap admission (KRW2,000) for what you get. There was some sort of changing of the guard type thing around 11am. Unsure if it's hourly or at a certain time of the day. Over crowded with tour groups in the front main buildings. There's plenty of ground to cover in the back and fewer people."
1945,4.0,"We went to Gyeongbokgong palace only to watch the Opening of Royal Guard Changing Ceremony at 10 am in the morning at the main entrance. This is a great opportunity to experience the rare traditional scene just in front of us. We were so excited and took photos with the traditional costume of the Guards after the ceremony. While waiting for the ceremony to be started, we took the opportunity to visit National Palace Museum located on the left of Gyeongbokgong main entrance which is free admission."
1946,4.0,"I have one day to visit the sites of Seoul while on a recent business trip. This was a must see and the changing of the guards ceremony made it especially nice. It helped that I had an excellent tour guide, but all in all the beauty of the grounds spoke for themselves. The museum on the grounds was a bit hokey. Then again, I'm not a big museum person so probably not fair to criticize! I recommend this on the list of things to see -- if you go here, I would skip other temple sites. This was clearly the best."
1947,2.0,"I'd like to start off by saying that I'm a history buff - especially the dynasties of East Asian countries. Having read so much good reviews, I made this palace my top priority during my visit. To say that I was disappointed would have been an understatement. It was like a palace on a budget. Don't go expecting the splendor of a bygone era. The sprawling grounds are filled with identical buildings with little to differentiate from one to another. Even my poor hard-working tour guide was hard put to infuse much enthusiasm into the group which had gone there with so much anticipation."
1948,4.0,"When in Seoul as a tourist this is the #1 attraction. When on business and having 1-2 hours spare time during the day or weekend, visit this place. Although reconstructed after much destruction by the Japanese colonists and relatively simple for a palace, the overall experience is great and the grounds make for a nice walk. Entry WRN 3,000. Be prepared for herds of tourists though during weekends & holidays, so probably during the week is a better experience. When I was there in August it was quite warm but above all very humid, so prepare for some serious sweating while walking the grounds. The National Folk museum in the back on the right is OK, if you have another hour and to cool off, but more interesting for locals than for foreigners. Entry for the museum is free. Showing your palace ticket will let you enter the palace grounds again."
1949,5.0,"Make sure you bring your walking shoes, the facility is huge! We saw a lot of people with bad shoes on. This is an amazing opportunity to see history. What a treat! The museum is also quite good. It is well worth the money and your time. Great for kids and adults. It may be difficult to bring someone in a wheelchair."
1950,4.0,"The low cost of the palace makes it worth it to just walk in and take a look around. I believe a majority of it is all reconstructed, so you aren't looking at centuries old buildings. You can still be impressed with the grounds and the effort to protect the culture and history."
1951,5.0,"It's 3000 Won to enter, which isn't bad. This palace is really intact and you can tell that they keep it preserved very well. The architecture is amazing! You can't fully go inside, but you can take a peek inside, to see how the other half lived back in the day."
1952,5.0,Entering the Palace grounds is deceptive - it is really a large complex and you could spend a good deal of time exploring the buildings (re-creations). There are ceremonies near the entrance with folks in period costumes. The architectural details are beautiful. There is a good museum across the street. We did the palace grounds - then had lunch (bibimbop) nearby and then went to the museum. You can also walk to the Blue House from here - that's the Korean White House where their President lives.
1953,4.0,"Having seen so many palaces and temples in Asia, we inititally thought this would be an hour long, in and out, type of attraction. To my amazement, between the palace, the changing of the guard and the two museums on the grounds of the palace, we spent the better part of the day here.  The Palace grounds themselves, house many different buildings in more than once style, so it is worth it to wander and see all the areas and the gardens that connect them. Everything is well kept and protected. Some buildings have rooms furnished and set up to give one a glimpse of how daily life was conducted in this palace. Although the changing of the gaurd is an obvious tourist catch with university age guards with glued on beards, it is still a fun and colourful display. There are two free museums on the grounds that are most definitely worth a visit as well. The Royal museum contains a restaurant, that while not cheap, offers high quality food that is very tasty."
1954,4.0,"I think the many many other reviews have said it all. Just want to share some info that visitors may need. There are free (?) guided tours in various languages. And on weekends, there are free guided tours by volunteer organizations, which is what we took. Our guide was a 13 year old high school student. While we were there, we could try on Korean traditional costumes for free and for a very good laugh. ;) The palace is closed every Tuesday.  While Gyeongbok Palace is definitely worth a visit, we heard that Changdeokgung Palace and its gardens were even better. Unfortunately, did not get to see Changdeokgung as we went on a Monday when it was closed ;( so do plan your trips!"
1955,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung palace, the obvious seat of government in older times, is a showpiece for the city, staring down at the city's main avenue through the reconstructed Gwanghwamun gate, giving it the proper sightlines so important in eastern palace layouts. Seen from the outside from the newly built pedestrian center area of that avenue, the gate and palace grounds are nicely framed by a backdrop of green mountains. Being the main palace in Seoul, it features a number of displays, including performers in traditional dress showing various aspect of court pageantry. Also worth visiting is the folk museum within. The buildings are predictable large and ornate, and more geometrically laid out than at other palaces. The detailing and shape of the roofs are unique, and the large number of carved stone figures, some of them unfortunately encased in transparent boxes due to unruly visitors, interesting indeed. As usual in such palaces, the women's sleeping quarters have a more livable look to them. Maintenance and upkeep are very good, reflective of the country's current prosperity."
1956,4.0,"Impressive and interesting palace though we preferred nearby Changdeokgung Palace, which has a more scenic setting. Gyeongbokgung is more out in the open. In addition to the palace buildings, the main things we liked about Gyeongbokgung were the changing of the guard ceremony and nearby location to the Blue House and Bukchon Hanok Village, which were both worth visiting."
1957,5.0,This was a beautiful area to walk around and learn some Korean history. The ticket price was very reasonable. Very nice gift shop/cafe.
1958,4.0,It is good place to visit if you walk lovers and would like to knownsome history. I went with kids . We enjoyed but avoid to visit in hot day.
1959,5.0,Visit the palace with Korean traditional costume (you could book it at shops nearby) allows you to enter the palace free of charged. Most authentic ancient feel in Korea! So beautiful with a mountain view behind the palace.
1960,5.0,"The palace is pretty big and nice, you can buy your ticket at the counter specially for foreigners. Also if you wear a hanbok you can enter for free"
1961,4.0,"I wasn't expecting much, but the history and details of this place impressed me. It is a large complex with many buildings. Each building has a unique and interesting purpose. Go with a guide."
1962,5.0,"I had the chance to visit the site after a business meeting nearby, this is very impressive and gives an idea about history of Korea"
1963,4.0,Infrastructure takes us to experience ancient times. A lot of diversified people & travelers you can see over there
1964,5.0,You must get a ticket to get in the palace. Its totally worth to visit. Try to spend 1 to 2 hours here to discover this beautiful palace.
1965,5.0,"Great for those who want to know more about the history and culture, and no you don’t really need a tour guide if you just want to take pretty photos and they had traditional wear for rental as well"
1966,4.0,"We rented those traditional Korean clothes, Hanbok, and took many picturesque photos. Worth doing. There is a cafe in the palace and so you can relax there in between taking photos."
1967,5.0,"Took a tour of the palace. Got some great photos, saw the changing of the guard ceremony and learned some history. It's definitely a must see if you visit Seoul"
1968,3.0,They also have free guided tours at few intervals of day. Local wear traditional attire while visiting this place.
1969,4.0,Super awesome place! I really love everything from here . Would like to go back again here! Super worth it
1970,4.0,Rent a hanbok and you can enter the palace free of charge. Hanbook rental can be found nearby the palace (to the right of the palace entrance).
1971,4.0,Easy to reach Gyeongbokgung palace with public transportation and many small restaurants not too far from the palace.
1972,4.0,such an amazing place to visit. we got a chance to wear a hanbok and moved around the palace..like we transfered back to Joseon Dynasty..love the feeling so much.
1973,5.0,Beautiful and historic spot in central Seoul. A must visit if you visit South Korea. Make sure to catch the guard change too!
1974,4.0,Beautiful grounds. Historical and informative. We especially enjoyed seeing all the folks wearing the traditional folk dress.
1975,5.0,"Make sure you take in the changing of the guard, we did the 1030hrs. Also do not miss visiting the museums, both are well worth it; best to set aside most of the day to do the museums justice."
1976,5.0,"This place is huge, elegant and historical. There are a few guards changing event, but the main event happen @ 11am."
1977,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace was the first and largest of the royal palaces built during the Joseon Dynasty. Built in 1395, Gyeongbokgung Palace was located at the heart of newly appointed capital of Seoul (then known as Hanyang) and represented the sovereignty of the Joseon Dynasty.  Beautiful architecture and they restore the building quiet well after the first palace was invaded by the Japanese back in 1945 - 1948 where Korea was attack, much of the building in the palace was run down and destroyed, they were moved to the second palace in Cheongdeokgung Palace.  There were beautiful matching presentation to shows how the army and General March during the dynasty and how they serve the king during Joseon Dynasty. Lovely wonderful place ☺️☺️☺️"
1978,5.0,"This is one of the main sights in Seoul. It looked like most was modern reconstruction, but it was still very impressive. The place was clean and quite large too. There are so many museums and galleries close by too."
1979,5.0,"Very beautiful grounds and buildings. Most fun was visitors dressing up period costume (guess they are available for rent) and taking photos, etc."
1980,5.0,"An essential part of any visit to Seoul. Unsurprisingly, the palace is a smaller version of the Forbidden City in Beijing. If you are wearing traditional Korean costume (hanbok) you get in for free, so when we were there about a third of the visitors were wearing traditional Korean garb, which gave the whole experience the feel of being at a masquerade. Do not miss the changing of the guard at 10:00 AM. There is an adequate English tour at 11:00, at no extra change."
1981,5.0,"If you're visiting Seoul just for a day, do not miss Gyeongbukgung Palace. Also wearing a hanbok allows you free entrance on most attractions in Seoul."
1982,5.0,Very inexpensive and gorgeous grounds to explore. Don't miss seeing the changing off the guards. My teenagers loved it!
1983,5.0,"Beautiful architecture, it is somehow like a scaled down version of the Forbidden Palace in Beijing. Missed the change-of-guards though. If you are one to look at details, you can spend a whole day here. Entrance to palaces in Seoul are considered cheap. This palace entrance fee is KRW3,000 but I opted to purchase the package that include few more palaces as well for only KRW10,000. Weather was pleasantly cool in November, and the autumn leaves are stunning"
1984,4.0,"It has some semblance to the Forbidden City but on a smaller scale. Dont miss changing of the guards that takes place at intervals.  Two types of tickets: palace only at W3k and a 4-Palaces combi ticket at W10k. We went for the cheaper one.  The main throne hall sits majestically in the centre with other buildings behind, linked by covered walkway. Behind the complex is a garden (I imagine it would be beautiful in summer) and a stream. There is a souvenir shop and toilet. There dont seem to be a place where we are allowed inside so we only take a peep through the window.  An experience to immerse yourself in the imperial Korean times."
1985,5.0,"Visited this place 2x last month since i didn't know you can't go deeper inside into the palace. In case, if anyone wants to see their guard changing time, 10AM and 2PM"
1986,4.0,"This is a very large open area. The buildings can only be viewed from the outside. I find it amazing that the colors seem so fresh while being exposed to the weather. It was interesting to see so many tourists dressed in traditional hanbok costumes, especially when they are taking photos of each other. Didn't know that was a ""thing"" until later. The changing of the guard is an interesting ceremony to watch."
1987,4.0,"This is a large expansive complex that really requires at least three hours to experience. And with the ridiculously cheap admission rates, you will definitely get your money's worth. A lot of people (locals and tourists alike) enjoy renting traditional Korean clothes (hanbuk) and often mill around throughout. Photos are accepted; just politely ask first. It really is a 5 star attraction; I am just not into this type of thing and would rather spend my time in a local neighbourhood hanging out which is why I gave it 4 stars."
1988,5.0,"The palace with its vast grounds is more than 600 years old and reflects Korean traditional architecture. Don't miss the changing of the guards ceremony at the Gwanghwamun gate at 10 am and 2 pm. It is quite elaborate and different. You get to pose with the guards for photos, after the cermony. Entry fee is 3000 won per person. But if you are wearing a hanbok (which you can rent from shops nearby), entry to the palace is free. If you are planning to visit multiple palaces, consider buying an integrated pass for 10,000 won with which you can visit four palaces and the Jongmyo temple."
1989,3.0,"It’s alright. Not much to see. There isn’t a lot of activities, it’s mostly just different areas of the palace"
1990,4.0,"The entire area is huge! We kinda in rush on our trip as we want to see the guard changing order which was scheduled at 10am and we have book a tour at another palace at 1130am so we didnt have much time to explore the area. When we were there, it was raining the night before and the water turns ice in the morning!"
1991,5.0,"Went there with guide, made all the difference. It brought the palace to life, with its rich history of past life. Much more rewarding with a guide."
1992,5.0,"When we arrived at the gates of the palace we were ushered inside the palace walls for a ceremony. Such good timing especially as the ceremony took less than ten minutes. Every 4th Wednesday is a special day and it is free to go in. There were lots of people in National dress looking very fine all glittering hooped skirts for the ladies and over large tall hats for the men. If you wear National Dress on any day it is also free to go in. The ground was very uneven and may be tricky for elderly to walk on. The grounds are massive, there was so much to see. It was originally built in 1395 and served as the home of Kings of the Joseon dynasty, and been extensively restored after various conflicts all but destroyed it. Well worth a visit. Take plenty of water and good walking shoes."
1993,5.0,"The park is beautiful specially with all The tourists (mainly Chinese) wearing the hanbok for a traditional look and photos. Don’t miss the changing of the royal guards at the main gate at 10am and 2pm everyday when not raining, except Tuesdays"
1994,5.0,"Historical site, Gyeongbokgung Palace built more than 3400 years ago. Great to see this ancient and majestic architecture! Complimentary entry for elderly above 65 years old. (Need to produce passports) and those who wear hanbok."
1995,5.0,"Majestic place, November is the best time to visit of you want to experience cold weather. Cable car and hiking to experience best shot at the top of the mountain."
1996,5.0,A beautiful palace that takes several hours to see properly. If you plan to visit any other palace or Jongymo Shrine buy the Combined Ticket as more cost effective. The Pavilions are especially lovely. There is no set way to go around and most buildings are empty (the Throne Room is partially furnished). If you hire a Hanbok (costume) entrance is free (depends on weather if you do this as they are not rain friendly).
1997,5.0,you will be surprised by the size of the palace and the few visitors; i visited at visiting hours and in some part of the palace I was the only one...it is like you have a private tour; take some guide to explain what you see to enjoy even better; very well preserved;
1998,5.0,"Great place to spend the day alone, or with friends an family. The architecture is ancient yet stunning and you get a glimpse into the Royal lifestyle from the past. Would definitely recommend."
1999,5.0,"Best scenery and relaxing. The areas of the palace was so big, and there are museum too, I would suggest whole day trip, they closed around 5pm, and entrance fee is just 3000won/adult (Affordable)."
2000,5.0,"one of the best place to enjoy autumn if you are around Seoul. You can make haft day trip by visit Gyeongbokgung, Samcheong-ro and Anguk , all closed to each others and walkable"
2001,5.0,Very beautiful place. When in traditional dress for free otherwise entrance 6 EUR. Good places for pictures.
2002,4.0,"Wonderfully restored historical jewel, in a fashion reminiscent of chinese and Japanese palaces - here you can see the life of ancient rulers of Korea."
2003,4.0,"Walking distance from where you can rent Hanboks is this palace.  It is well preserved and provides the best background for your Joseon inspired photoshoot.  Since there are many visitors, in regular clothes and in costume, it takes patience and good timing to get that perfect travelling in time, kdrama scene, hanbok shot. But oh so worth the effort!"
2004,5.0,"I visited gyeonbokgung evening tour with my friends wearing hanbok.. we were able to tour the palace and see it in daylight and night time.. it was so beautiful! We were lucky as there was a traditional korean music performance on the palace grounds as well, so we got to experience that😊"
2005,4.0,"It’s worth noting it is closed on Mondays. Don’t make the mistake I made. I can back when it was open and was here to the changing of the guards, it was a little over rated"
2006,5.0,"Around Gyeongbokgung, there’s a lot of Korean national costume rental shops . For you to create your own imagination how you look like when you are in Joseon Dynasty. Lots of fun with taking many pictures with your friends. ❤️❤️"
2007,5.0,I loved the old place with change of leaves. Taking leisurely couple hours of walk with a friend on a weekend was a perfect way to relax & catch up.
2008,5.0,"This is probably the most popular attraction in Seoul for both tourists and locals. It was very busy and everywhere there were people wearing national dress (hired from shops in the area). We timed our arrival for the changing of the guard which happens twice per day, it was colourful but not too serious. The palace covers a vast area and comprises a complex set of impressive buildings which are loosely interconnected. Most of the rooftops are highly decorated following the style of most historic buildings in Seoul but they have obviously been restored recently. The price of entry was very cheap although the secret garden is an additional cost (we didn't have time to go there). Just next door is another royal palace, Changgyeonggung, which was much quieter and is on a smaller scale but has lovely gardens."
2009,5.0,Everyone is wearing Hanbok and no entrance fees if you wear Hanbok there. Good place to take photo and the palace is still well maintained.
2010,4.0,Must visit if you are first time arrive In Korea.You can learn and observe history of Korea from this palace.Free entrance if you wear hanbok .Nice for sight-seeing and you can captured all nice picture.
2011,5.0,Arrived here just in time for the changing of the guard and were glad we caught it as the spectacle of the different costumes is not to be missed. If you plan to see the other palaces too get the Royal Palace pass - it doesn't save you much money but it does mean you don't have to queue up for tickets again so saves a lot of time. Lots of beautiful buildings to wander around.
2012,5.0,"Visited this palace while I was in Seoul for business. It’s absolutely beautiful and the changing of the guard ceremony is so interesting to watch. If you’re in Seoul, definitely check this out!"
2013,5.0,"Go there, take some pictures and escape the noisier parts of Seoul. You‘ll find lots of people in traditional dresses, which is nice to look at"
2014,5.0,After five visits to Seoul I feel this is a must see if you’re interested in the history and culture of the area.
2015,5.0,"For me a must visit when in Seoul. You need to wear comfortable shoes in exploring the place as it is big area. When a visitor is wearing the Korean traditional costume “Hanbok”, there’s no need to pay for entrance. One can rent for the costumes in many different rental stalls nearby."
2016,5.0,"It was very interesting to visit Palace, on the enter they offer me to dress up like ancient warrior, we also visited museum."
2017,5.0,"The buildings are beautiful and well maintained, lots to explore for 2-3 hours. Many Koreans in national dress add to the spectacle. Don't miss the changing of the guards parade, the costumes, flags and ancient weapons are very impressive. The entry fee is very reasonable."
2018,4.0,Probably a must see for every first time visitor to Seoul The free tour was great 1330 and 3 or so other departured from the main gate
2019,5.0,"We visited this gorgeous palace early on a Saturday afternoon and encountered a massive crowd of tourists in the big courtyard behind the Gwanghwamun Gate. These visitors likely lingered after watching the colorful changing of the guard ceremony, which takes place Wednesday through Monday at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Though we missed that afternoon’s performance, we had watched it here on one of our previous visits to Seoul. I consider these palace ceremonies, which are free for the public to watch, to be one of the great values for tourists in the city.  Many of the people we saw here had rented traditional Korean attire from a courtyard shop to wear into the vast royal complex beyond, which requires an admission fee. On the palace grounds, they posed for selfies and for others, who wanted to capture them in front of the various well-maintained buildings, such as the throne hall or the crown prince quarters. These separate structures throughout the grounds give good insight into the living conditions for royalty during the Joseon Dynasty.  Gyeongbokgung Palace, in use from 1395-1592, burned during the Japanese invasion and was not rebuilt until 1865. We found the well-shaded grounds to be immaculate and a pleasurable place to stroll. Water features include a lovely ornamental pond. This is the largest palace from the Joseon Dynasty that still exists and would be my recommendation for the one palace to see for those with time constraints.  Located in Seoul’s Northern area, the palace can be reached by subway, line 3 to Gyeongbokgung stop, exit 5.  ,"
2020,5.0,"Just got a very good experiences in Gyeongbokgung Palace. I have good trip to this peace place when stayed in Seoul last week. The design is so amazing. And the atmosphere is also good.Many beautiful trees, Recommend this place for any people who come Seoul."
2021,5.0,"This palace is beautiful. On a nice day it is an incredible place to walk around. The juxtaposition of the old vs the new city is amazing. There is plenty of shade if it is hot, and even a little teahouse. You can spend hours here just wandering around."
2022,4.0,It’s an impressive place so I recommend at least walking through it. It’s 3000 per person so go there if you are doing the gardens at Changdeokgung palace or are walking in Bukchon Hanok Village. It is a nice place but I found it a bit weird that tourists were wearing traditional dresses while walking around the palace.
2023,4.0,"Great preservation of the grand palace. We were so lucky also to witness the changing of the guards, apart from taking selfies with so willing pretty korean ladies in hanbok costume!"
2024,4.0,"A traditional space that is evidence of its past, very vast. If you get your timings right there are also reenactments using actors in traditional attire. The site is very busy until you get far from the paid entry section."
2025,4.0,"The palace is packed with tourists. We instead went to the farthest area north of the front gate where it was too far for tourists to go to. The view of the mountain was stunning. You can also imagine yourself walking as a resident of the palace hundreds of years ago. Oriental magpies and Brown-eared bulbuls make the palace come alive, not to mention the autumn foliage blazing in the background. You're going to have a great experience of the attraction where there are less people, in my opinion."
2026,4.0,"While this palace complex is similar in layout to the Forbidden City in Beijing, it is much smaller and less grand. If you visit on the hour you can see the changing of the guard ceremony. The costumes reflect the period when this was the Korean capital. This ceremony was worth the visit alone."
2027,5.0,"It’s really easy to find the Palace, there are signs from the subway station all the way to the place.  We went during Chuseok, a national holiday, so entry was free. It’s a really huge palace with plenty to see.  Make sure to bring your selfie stick or camera, there are so many gorgeous views, buildings and gardens so you’ll definitely get some fantastic pictures.  It’s also beautiful to see people dressed in traditional Korean hanbok. As mentioned, we were there on a holiday but I think you can usually rent a hanbok for some photos.  It started to rain a little bit the day we went, but it was still really pretty."
2028,5.0,The place where you can view the traditional palace and pavilion including its beatiful park and background of mountain.
2029,5.0,"Amazing palace It's very old palace and amazing please You can see every thing from past You can spend more 4 , 5 hours"
2030,3.0,"The entire complex is vast. Definitely worth a visit. If you have interest for the history then we highly recommend a tour. Because of the scale of the site it’s easy to miss some interesting parts.  They did not provide a map where you purchase the entrance tickets, it would be useful, we asked and the shoed us along.  It’s a popular attraction especially on Sunday. 3000 Korean won per person. Allocate at least one hour for this attraction. The washrooms are large and very clean."
2031,4.0,"Tool subway and easy to get there. Entrance fee is cheap and full of tourists. Many ppl wear traditional Korea clothing entering the palace. Ticketing queue at the main entrance is always long in the morning. From the staff, there are 2 more ticketing entrance which has far less ppl at the side and back. The palace is huge and you could spend more than half day walking and taking photos. It is worth visiting for first time."
2032,5.0,We strolled for hours in the vast palace compound and enjoyed every bit of it. It's beautiful and maintained in good condition.  We would recommend to come in the morning so you can enter also the museum (closes at around 17:00~18:00).
2033,5.0,"Built in 1395 Gyeongbokgung Palace was abandoned and rebuilt in the 19th century and again destroyed by Japan in 1911.Two pavilions and the throne room survived. It is famous for the changing of the royal guard twice a day in front of Gwanghwamun, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. (except on Tuesdays). It is very colourful and special.While you are waiting try the Dunkin Donuts opposite!t"
2034,5.0,"I visit with a study abroad group from Chonnam Univeristy and it was amazing. Beautiful architecture, beautiful ponds, and foliage. Would 100% recommend"
2035,4.0,"My wife and I went to check this spot out and it was great.  There is a subway station attached to the place so it's super easy to get there.  The museum is free and quite interesting, some cool old restored royal cars and other stuff.  The palace is impressive and well maintained. Tons of photo opportunities, if you are in to that.  Recommend renting the costumes, it's fun and they let you in for free if you wear it."
2036,5.0,We have visited several palaces in Korea and this is the best so far. Two unique features include a little library and lake where the royalty had events.
2037,4.0,"The biggest palace in Seoul, there is guided tour in English and in Chinese or you can just walk around at your pleasure. Has a breath-taking pavilion, beautiful architecture for photography at the surroundings. One of the pavilions is under repair work and will take many years more to complete, such a pity. You can rent hanbok from shops outside the palace, and then your entrance will be free."
2038,5.0,"It is one of the places where you can see traditional Korean palaces. There is Gwanghwamun, and the scenery of night and day is beautiful."
2039,4.0,"We hired traditional hanbok dress so we’re allowed in to the palace for free. The grounds are huge and the decoration is amazing. The one thing to note is that whenever you go, there is very little shade so if it’s a hot day, make sure you have water. There is a small shop in the grounds, but as a result is very busy. Overall the palace and its surroundings are really interesting and worth a visit."
2040,5.0,"Enjoy the autumn colours and the beauty of the grand palace. Best to visit first thing in the morning, there will be lots of tourists and Korean wearing Hanbok (traditional Korean costume). You can rent the Hanbok for the day and walk around the palace and apparently, if you are in Hanbok, you get to go in for free."
2041,4.0,"If you want to take photos and wear hanbok- this is the place to be! If you want a deeper understanding of the history, get a guide. The grounds are expansive and you can spend hours wandering especially if you visit the museum there. However, note that it is not pram/wheelchair friendly. Also, lines to get tickets can get really long."
2042,3.0,"If you would like just to have a look at the neighbourhood, the grand palace and people strolling with their traditional hanbok, you can just stay outside and take wonderful pictures without having to soend your money getting inside as there were not so much to see."
2043,4.0,"Nice big complex, with múltiple buildings, historical place , i take with tour compañía, But cheaper by subway, a must if you go to seoul"
2044,4.0,"Everything about this Palace resonates history and the rich culture of the Koreans. Entry is free for vistors in the traditional outfit (Hanbok) and at a low cost for visitors without the outfit.  There are several shops near the near Palace where you can rent a Hanbok for 1 to 2hours. The cost of renting my outfit was ₩10,000 for 2hours. The palace also has a park where you can have lunch after some sightseeing. This is worth your last penny. Enjoy"
2045,5.0,"I visited Gyeongbokgung Palace on March 10th 2019, for me was a cold day since I live in the carribean, and thought I'd love to wear a hanbok, i could bear to be in thos very thin fabric dresses, so I skip that and pay the fee to access the palace.  The place is HUGE I walked and walked and walked is seem endless. I visited the museum of South Korean history,was very interesting and very big too.  The building I love to watch the most was the main building where the throne of the King was, and to watch the show of the change of guard at the main entrance of the palace.  Was a great experience and I highly recommend it. Z"
2046,5.0,"A visit to Gyeongbokgung should be on everyone’s list when visiting Seoul. It was the main palace for the Joseon Dynasty, the last dynasty before the Japanese colonization in 1910. It is significant historically, but also worth visiting because of its beauty. Be sure to rent some traditional clothing before going in to get some unique pictures that will be truly memorable!"
2047,5.0,"This palace (mostly restored) is the oldest of the Joseon dynasty. Free for those over 65 and note that 64 in US counts as 65 in Korea (bring your passport for proof of age). Otherwise, just 3,000 won.  Very large and many photo ops. Be sure to spend time in the free Palace Museum just outside the paying area."
2048,3.0,"Nice enough, but big open space and after you’ve stared at it for 5-10 mins...wondering what to do with one’s self."
2049,4.0,"On the dates posted on their official website (in Korean; not in English), foreigners can purchase up to 4 tickets at the ticket booth with a valid ID/passport. When I visited in September 2019, nighttime ticket sales started at 6:30 pm. Visitors were able to enter the palace at 6:40 pm, and were guided to go out at 9:00 pm. Hanboks (Korean traditional dresses) look gorgeous with the palace's night view!"
2050,4.0,"The buildings, the grounds and the history are incredible. Everything you see is historic. To start, we took the #3 train and got off at the Jongno station, exit 1 takes you straight to the palace and museum. We got there right when the changing of the guards had finished so be there by 10 am or 2 pm if you want to see it. But we were able to go on the 11 am guided tour in English, it is free and it is the only way to know what you are seeing because most buildings look the same. The tour takes an hour and then you can walk around by yourself. It is very inexpensive, around $2.50 US unless you dress in traditional Korean clothes, then it is free. At the end exit towards the Seoul Library and walk to the Bukchon Hanok Village ."
2051,4.0,"Very nice place, great to come over the weekend and see the local Koreans dressed on their traditional clothing"
2052,4.0,"This Palace has some beautiful architecture & bugger structures than Seoul other palaces, but this makes it a lot busier. The buildings are set in a classic structure - as you pass through the biggest & most regal first, then lots of structures of lesser quality follow after with buildings & Court yards to either side. This Palace is easy to wander on your own without a guide. The route follows through to the National Folk Museum & also the is the National Museum of Korea at the side."
2053,5.0,"Love this Palace in every season. The Main Royal Palace of the Joseon Dynasty - if you are going to visit just one cultural site on your visit to Seoul I would recommend the Gyeongbokgung Palace. You can tour on your own, help a student volunteer offering a tour, or join a free guided tour offered by the management office in English, Japanese, Chinese, or Korean. Entry is a reasonable 3000 for adults, 1,500 for juniors and free for under 6y or over 65y. Changing of the guard takes place at 1000 and 1400 inside the Gwanghwamun gate and Gate Guard duty performance outside the gate is at 1100 and 1300 daily. Even without seeing these performances wandering through is worthwhile, you can see the blue house from the far corner of the grounds, and the National Folk museum entrance is connected to the eastern side. Highly recommend to all - accessible and enough room for the little ones to get some energy out."
2054,5.0,A wonderful slice of history brought to life. Probably most easily navigated for tourists as part of a city tour. Note that there's free entrance to the palace for people in tradition Hanbok dress.
2055,5.0,This palace is a must-see if you are in Seoul for the first time. We visited on a national cultural day so many visitors had rented traditional clothing which made the visit even more colorful and entry was free this day. This palace is immense with many internal sections so plan on spending a few hours walking around the grounds. It is possible to rent headphones with a device where you point to a spot on the map and it gives you a detailed history (available in multiple languages). We witnessed the changing of the guard (at 10 am) which was a colorful event. The gardens and ponds in the back are serene and beautiful. There is also a museum full of national treasures from the Joseon Dynasty. Definitely worth a visit!
2056,5.0,"After a while the palaces start to look alike, but they each are beautiful in their own way. Best viewed in the winter or after a storm because the skies are usually cleared of smog and yellow dust. Take your time while walking around, take ur all in."
2057,5.0,We recommend to visit this magnificent palace during weekends so that you can engage a volunteer tour guide to show you around the palace and giving you more insights into the Korean dynasty era. A nice place for history lovers!
2058,5.0,"A must-visit location in Seoul, portraying Korean architecture and culture. Try wearing hanbok (Korean traditional dress) while visiting the palace."
2059,5.0,This is a fabulous place for anyone and everyone to explore Korea history. From the palace walls to the museum inside you definitely get a sense of what the old days were like and beauty that Korea has Architect wise. The price to enter is such a small amount $3 USD or free if you rent a hanbok- which I highly recommended for memorable pictures.
2060,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is an amazing experience and worth the visit when in Seoul! Step back into time more than 600 years to walk these grounds and take in all the history that makes this palace a “MUST VISIT”.! The grounds are vast with countless buildings, gates and walls to wonder around and take in all the aspects of Korean history and culture! Make sure you give yourself at least a couple hours for this one; it is spread out with lots to take in.  Highly recommend.!!"
2061,5.0,"Wow. Visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace was the highlight on this one day tour. We felt as if we were transported back in time, by just walking through the Palace gate. It felt surreal for me. Seeing the size of the property and the designs certainly added to the mystique of the surroundings. The changing of the guards reminds me of British Palace tours, only more colorful and artsy. Added to the attraction were the visitors of all ages wearing rented traditional garbs. Amazingly awesome place to visit. We spent an hour here including visit to the National Folk museum situated on the same grounds. A must see when you go."
2062,3.0,"This Palace also houses the Korean National Palace Museum and the National Folk Museum. Because it was the biggest remaining Korean palace , the whole complex was systematically destroyed during the Japanese Occupation at the beginning of the 20th Century, and is slowly being rebuilt , including demolition of former Japanese government buildings to recreate the majestic Palace gateways! So everything you see today is very recent."
2063,4.0,"Less opulent than the Forbidden City in Beijing, but more trees, flowers, and greenery. Lovely to walk around and see people in hanbok (beautifully crafted traditional clothing)."
2064,4.0,"Simply a must see in Korea. Even if most of it has been rebuilt as it was mostly destroyed by Japs and Korean War after that, it is now in good condition. Large park, beautiful architecture, what are you waiting for?!"
2065,4.0,"It was an interesting place. The palace is a large area with different buildings and gardens. By the entrance gate it was very crowded but the more you walk inside, the less people there is. Alot of people are dressed in the traditional clothes, so it was very interesting. It felt like a movie set or a scene from the past. The buildings were simple with colored wood decorations."
2066,5.0,"Amazing place to visit. We did this as part eof our Seoul full day tour, so our guide explained alot. We arrived right as the changing of the guard ceremony was beginning. Plenty to see and learn."
2067,5.0,"One of the biggest palaces in terms of walking and things to see. Bit of a health and safety hazard, so watch young children as falls are signposted but there are few barriers. Pro of this, is better pictures without black and yellow health and safety tape on all edges. It's a little maze, and there's many complexes to see.  Grab a free map from the entrance and tick off places as you visit, Look out for Korean's wearing traditional clothes and having photo shoots in the grounds.  Easily could spend a full day here.  Get it as part of the Royal Palace pass to get a discount - pass is valid for 3 months from purchase date."
2068,4.0,"This is a huge palace compound. A clear fine product of the Korean Dynasty. There are a few gates and halls with distinctive architects for perfect photo. Even so when one dress in the traditional Hanbok. While the inner compound is stone paved and very bare, there is an outer area of greenery. This is the part we enjoyed most. Old trees, green grass, big pond with the willow trees which contrasted the inner court. Really enjoy the stroll and relax atmosphere. Another perfect spots for photos."
2069,4.0,"Unfortunately we forgot to visit at the back side of the palace. 😭😭 Wear hanbok for free entrance. Hanbok rental is from 12,00/hour 18,00/4hour The shop just across the road from side gate of gyeongbukgung. There are many hanbok rental shop around there."
2070,5.0,Cheap entrance ticket or free when you enter wearing with traditional Korean “Hanbok” which can be rented in many shops in Bukchon village.  Nice well preserved palaces and beautiful lake.
2071,5.0,"I really fell in love with Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's a big palace that shows the greatness of old Korean Kingdom. It's very easy see locals dressing in national costume: that's make the atmosphere even more magical. We also saw the changing of guard ceremony. Entrance ticket is cheap, only 3.000 won each."
2072,5.0,It's really interesting for visit the palace of the country we visit. This palace is the main one with beautiful views.
2073,4.0,"The palace is quite lovely. I took the train to Gyeongbokgung station and walked to the exit marked with ‘palace’, super easy to get too, two trains from Seoul Station. I walked around the palace grounds visiting the large number of buildings. The grounds were beautiful, I highly recommend this palace."
2074,5.0,"We were fortunate that the palace was free to enter on the day we went, however, even if you have to pay, it's the best palace in the city.  It's also charming to see locals, especially youngsters dressing in national costume to get the best pictures for their Instagram account.  There are a couple of cafes in the grounds and also at the museum towards the back if you need a break."
2075,5.0,They provide a guide and transportation. Very enjoyable tour. Guide spoke excellent English and ver knowledgeable.
2076,3.0,"It was good to know the history of the biggest palace of Korean history. Pack of people taking pictures with hanbok in the front area, but if you walk more inside the complex area, there are less crowded place."
2077,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is a lovely place to visit and take photos, especially if you rent Hanbok (traditional Korean outfits). It doesn't cost much to visit, maybe 3000 won, but if you rent Hanbok you can get in for free and take awesome photos."
2078,5.0,It was a bit rainy when we came but don't let that put you off if you're prepared. There's a lot of buildings to walk around and see. There's also a Cafe and gift shop if you want to stop and rest a bit
2079,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is the grandest of Seoul's 5 royal palaces. It has had several uses through time but is now a major tourist attraction. The Royal Palace pass works here, the entrance fee is 3000KW. The Gyeonghoeru Pavilion is only visitable by pre-booking online, this is free. The guided tour is in Korean only."
2080,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is somewhat like the Forbidden City - smaller, but laid out as a series of inner squares with temples. (Also, less built up, less crowded and generally more accessible.) Watching the changing of the guard is an especially nice time/way to visit!"
2081,3.0,Free as it is Korea National Day this week. Nice corridors to take photos but bad for a hot day. You will see lots of tourists dressed in traditional clothing  However today It is scorching no shelter or shade to cool.  Plan well before entering on hot day.
2082,5.0,"A fascinating palace complex which was the main palace of the longstanding Joseon Dynasty. It is preferable to visit with a tour guide who can provide background both on the history of the dynasty and the significance of the buildings. Its grounds also house the National PalaceMuseum and the National Folk Museum, both of which are worth visiting."
2083,5.0,If you love history and going back in time this is a place you must see. You can even dress up in the clothes they did.
2084,3.0,"We went and it was pretty cool to see, but seemed to be missing something. One thing we noticed pretty quick was most places were closed and you could only see the outside of the buildings.  If you have been to The Forbidden City, this can be a disappointment."
2085,5.0,This is a very important place for Korean History. It was an honor to review the palace and see where the Old School Kings lived.
2086,4.0,"This place is huge. Many temples to see and the museums are included with the price. A lot of walking. Also got to see the changing of the guard, it is done twice a day. First one was at 10:00 am."
2087,4.0,To me it was more of a giant park than a historical palace visit. It is very large and so if you are wanting more than a beautiful peaceful walk I recommend going during one of the times with a tour guide.
2088,4.0,"Beautiful gardens. Tour guides are very helpful and speak perfect English. It would have been a little easier to not wander in circles if the buildings and roads were better labeled. The grounds itself are really big, so make sure to wear walking shoes! If it's not too hot, go hire the hanbok costumes and experience the palace the way Korean royals would have in the Joseon era."
2089,5.0,Instagramable view and different area to post even their trees are amazing like from the jungle also good for photo ops
2090,4.0,"This palace is huge. The buildings are lovely. Not much to see inside them. Very cool though. Plan several hours if you want to see everything. The changing of the guards is something I only saw at this palace and was nice to see. Crowded toward the front, but far fewer people toward the back. Good view of the ""blue palace"" from the back gate. Gwanghwamun on the purple line is the subway stop I used."
2091,5.0,"Make sure you find an offline map at the gate.  It was a hot sunny day, and we travelled with a baby. The place was stroller friendly. Some of the areas were under constructions, including the famous small lake. But nonetheless, we managed to cover most of the areas and found many cheap and good quality souvenirs at the shop (make sure to try their drinks as well!). We got cute bookmarks, notes, even jewelries.  Overall, it was a good place where you can have a leisurely stroll (even better if it's not too hot)."
2092,4.0,"Renting hanbok costumes - traditional Korean dress - gives one free entry.  Otherwise, the price is a most reasonable KRW3000 per person.\  We visited on a weekday. It rained for 15 minutes but thankfully stopped.\  The grounds are extensive and changing of the guard beautifully done. One can pose beside these individuals."
2093,5.0,"Largest palace, entry free of 3000 won, free if wearing hanbok, must visit and have look at the grandeur, very beautifully maintained. Recommend joining a free tour for a very informative tour around the palace, can enter the palace museum and folk museum for free."
2094,5.0,We joined one of the free English tour and the guide did a great job at summarizing the main points and explaining historical facts for people without knowledge of Korea history. The Palace itself is beautiful and the crowds of people/tourists dress in hanbok (traditional costumes) give it an additional charm.
2095,5.0,"I loved the place worth the visit, wearing the costume and taking photos it makes great memory pictures plus you can do the tour alone after doing some walk from the city"
2096,4.0,So we had to walk and walk and see where the women lived and where the king lived and where the conjugated. Sorry not my cup of tea.
2097,5.0,This was built 500 years ago and some parts were burnt during Japan invade Chosun dynasty. It was restored and open to public. This palace is surrounded by mountain. Compare to Jaguemsung In China it seems small but this is more delicated. You can feel historic area among mordern Seoul. Nearby this palace you can reach many historic places around Jongro.
2098,4.0,"Regardless of the crowd, I still can feel the traditional vibe of ghost of its past. I thank anyone who were wearing hanbok(s) [The traditional Korean attire]. The palace was just okay though but the pillars were still in good structure and gives me the chance to enjoy the scene where the girls in hanbok are just so suited with the palace's pillars, just like what I always see in the historical Korean drama. Apart from that, the change of guard is also a must watch and it is pretty colourful."
2099,5.0,"this wasnt busy when we went,. Noon on a weekday. The palace is largr than life. So beautiful and people are dressed in their authentic korean wear (free entry if you have th dress code). But we paid some 3000 KRW to enter. spent about and 1 hr taking some pictures. amazing experience"
2100,5.0,This place is beautiful with all iconic ancient Korean architecture. You can take tons of photos in every corner. You can enter free if you wear Hanbok
2101,5.0,"If you only have time to visit one palace, I recommend this one. It is the largest of the 5 palaces and most impressive. Expect this palace you be crowded. Many female visitors are wearing the traditional dresses, which are great for photo shoots. Palace compound is huge, with many halls, rooms, quarters, pavilions etc. I spent about 1.5 hours exploring this compound.  Time yourself to witness the changing of royal guards ceremony daily at 1000hr and 1400hr. Ceremony is held at the public square in front of the palace entrance. Hence, you can even watch this ceremony without purchasing the palace entrance ticket. If time permits, you can also visit the 2 nearby museums which are free admission, ie National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum."
2102,4.0,"We went in for free because we were wearing hanbok. The palaces were well preserved. We did not find the main palace though, maybe because of the ongoing constructions. And the hanbok was a bit hot so we just left after we took some pictures. I am definitely going back there on colder days."
2103,5.0,"During the Korean Civil War (1950-53), Hanseong (Seoul today) was changed hands four times and everything in the City was destroyed by Air Raids and Bombs including the Palace of Chosun Dynasty.. The Main Gate of the Gyeongbokgung Palace was also totally destroyed.  Now, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace was rebuilt according to historic look and an tourist attraction event was performed at the Square behind and before the Palace. It is the Gate Guard Rotation Ceremony Show. Everyday, except closed day, has two sections. Morning section at 10 am and afternoon section at 2 pm. No admission fee necessary. Be reminded that you shud come before commenced otherwise you can not enter the Gate during the show. For preview, you can check the >30 seconds videos at map sites of Gyeongbokgung Palace Korea and Gwanghwamun or 12 minutes video at my tube.  One very generous move here is free admission to the Palace for all elders of 65 and above, including foreighners."
2104,5.0,It is a must visit place in Korea. Visitors can experience by getting wear traditional handbook. Folk museum and traditional village near by also attracted us lot. Thank you Seoul.
2105,5.0,"Right place for a nice walk and to admire a lot of people wearing the traditional hanbok. It's the main Palace of the city so you should not miss it. If you are familiar with Asia and mostly with China, you will feel as you've been there already..."
2106,5.0,"This is a beautiful palace on large grounds, housing other temples and museums. One of the central spots to visit. Korean youth often visit in traditional costumes. You will want to plan most of the day to visit here and its associated attractions."
2107,5.0,"This is the largest and most spectacular of the ""Five Grand Palaces"", and we consider it a must stop in Seoul. If at all possible, visit this site when you can experience the Changing of the Guard (morning). This is a magnificent event--you will take more photos than you ever imagined. This was part of our tour, and it paid dividends to have a guide."
2108,4.0,"If you want to see a Korean templethings, this would be Your place to visit. At the time of our visit, there was things under maintenance, but it did not bother too much."
2109,4.0,Find guard changing period and go. Huge place so be prepared to walk.A lot of shops nearby for food.
2110,5.0,Main tourist attraction in Seoul South Korea. Palaces history is so interesting and beautiful stroll around. Lots of historical sites. Must visit if in Seoul.  Love the tourists in their traditional dress.
2111,5.0,"Of the Joseon Dynasty in Seoul, this is by far our favorite -- though the signnage is less than ideal. Some of the buildings were undergoing renovation and there was no mention until one arrived at the purported location and all that was visible was a wall. But the grounds extensive -- and there are a variety of buildings. If one is only going to a single palace, I would suggest this is the one to visit."
2112,5.0,"If you want to know about history and see it first hand, this is the place to visit. It has very interesting story and you will be wowed with its historic sites, buildings and the surroundings. A must visit."
2113,5.0,This place is well worth a visit—an important historical site. Grounds are well cared and buildings are really impressive—especially the main throne building.
2114,5.0,"A must see for anyone in Seoul. Walking through the palace gives an impression of what 14th century high society in Korea was like. If you are not coming with a guide, go on line and read about the history and locations within the palace for a forfilling experience."
2115,5.0,Located in the heart o Seoul and easily accessible by subway. You can spend the whole day wandering around the palace. Do catch the Palace Guard Changing Ceremony.
2116,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung palace is located in the heart of Seoul. It is super easy to access and there are many things that you can enjoy around the palace. You will see many people wearing hanbok which is a traditional clothing of Korea and it is free to enter the place if you wore hanbok. There are many cafes and restaurant around area. you can walk to Cheonggyecheon, Myeongdong, Insadong or Bukchon Hanok village from the palace."
2117,4.0,"The first time I visited the palace was in 2011 to see the residence of Prince Gian and Prince Troy of Princess Hours. NOw that I'm back with my son, we got to discover more about South Korea through the museum and writings about the palace. We toured on our own and it was a warm day so we spent only a few hours here. It was really wide and we got to cool down while we explored the museums in the area.  If in Korea, it's a must to see this beautiful structure and I'm glad they preserved the old buildings for us tourists to see,"
2118,5.0,"Firstly, the entrance tickets are very affordable -- W3,000 for adults and W1,500 for children up to 18 years old. These low entrance prices make the visit worthwhile to learn about the place and take photos. And a tourist has to take photos, right? Secondly, anyone can gain free entrance by wearing a traditional Korean costume, which can be rented from stores across the main gate of the palace (free entrance in other palaces too, while wearing the traditional Korean costume). This makes your selfie photos inside the palace even better :). Thirdly, the place was lightly filled when we came in on a Saturday late morning. Stay about 2 hours minimum, about 3 hours maximum."
2119,4.0,"This was the first, largest and the main royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. It was destroyed during the Japanese occupation and has taken much time and effort to be rebuilt and restored. The Changing of the Guard happened while I was there at about 9:30am. Free admission to even foreigner seniors. Many of the girls and some boys even wore the hanbok costumes for Instagram photos. From here one can go to the Folk Museum and then on to Bukchon Hanbok Village and then the Chandeokgong Palace which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Expect to spend many hours exploring this whole area as it is well worth it. Moving on from there take in lunch on Insadong Street and browse the shops. This will be such a day well spent in Seoul."
2120,5.0,"Feel very humble inside this place, but it’s crowded and sometime hard to move or take pictures at the same time"
2121,5.0,"One of the key cultural attractions of Korea in my opinion! There are many shops around the palace that rent traditional clothing especially to go to the palace, so that's what I did (foreigners are wlecomed to do so!). I loved walking around the castle and taking pictures. There are many tourists inside the main court but of you venture into the gardens behind the castle it gets less crowded."
2122,5.0,Feel the pulse of the bustling capital of South Korea. This picturesque palace is the first royal palace built in 1395 during the time of the Joseon dynasty.
2123,4.0,Really beautiful palace. Worth visiting while in Seoul.beautiful buildings and gateways. Clothing hire available. Wonderful architecture.Had a lovely walk around the palace grounds
2124,5.0,"The original palace dates back to the 1300s but various invasions by the Japanese in the 1500s, 1800s and 1910 has meant a lot fo the original palace has been destroyed. Much of the palace is reproductions of the original buildings but the architecture is still very impressive. Be equipped with walking shoes and headwear as the palace is quite expansive and exposed"
2125,4.0,"We visited the palace on the last Wednesday of the month, so the admission was free. However, a fee is charged for the guided tour. The palace area was large. There were many tourists wearing Hanbok at the palace. We saw the changing of guard ceremony. There is also a cafe that sells snacks and souvenirs in the palace area."
2126,4.0,"only issue was that wehn we there, they were preparing for some sort of conference, so missed the photo with the reflection!"
2127,4.0,It’s a big place with long heritage and old construction building. But I have been to Beijing Forbidden Palace. The construction heritage and treasures of this palace just can’t compare to that
2128,5.0,"We had a beautiful and enjoyable experience here. Rented a hanbok from nearby and took photos and videos in this Unesco heritage site. It was a really nice day. Come with a full stomach as food is not allowed inside. Or have snacks outside by the exit before or after. We enjoyed the dumpling shop and CU store, in our hanbok :-) Well kept and beautiful Palace.  Staff in Secret Garden was kind and helped us on our way, especially when we were last in the group. Thank you for the English conversation and encouraging words to us as we walked up and down and climbed the steps."
2129,4.0,Love the architecture and colours on the palace . It wax good to see the guards in traditional dress. There are also a lot of ladies dressed in hanbok. 3000 Won entrance fee. Souvenir shop and cafe off to the side.
2130,2.0,Nice taking photographs but long walk from station. Many people wearing the Hanbok. Good for children to understand their culture.
2131,5.0,"I’ve watch many period dramas, I’ve read quite a few books on Korean History and always enjoyed documentaries in regards to the history of Joseon Dynasty. But to walk through it, to sit within the palace walls and have tea with dessert really made my knowledge come together."
2132,4.0,"The entrance, main palace and the palace museum are a must see (KW3000 entrance fee). The changing of the guards is an added bonus if you happen to be on time for the event. Note that the palace is expansive which require a lot of walking on stone path and gravel. There are not much shaded tress and places to rest expect around buildings. So an early morning visit is recommended. I made a reservation for an English guided tour of the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion only be disappointed as the tour guide decided to conduct it in the local vernacular. I did inquire though as she stated that she can give me a 10 minute English guide after she is done with the group but left before she finished."
2133,4.0,This palace was very large & a bit hard to finish the tour but it's very good. The palace was informative & interesting stories about the culture & history of Korean!
2134,5.0,Beautiful ancestral place. Having a tour guide to fill you in about all the history is great. Would recommend this to anyone visiting the area.
2135,5.0,A massive complex which was a great experience. Surrounded by lovely grounds and the wonderful guards display. The guards seemed to change on the hour.
2136,4.0,wonderful experience seeing all the people in traditional hanboks everywhere at the palace grounds . A place one should not miss.
2137,3.0,"Although not the most attractive, Gyeongbokgung palace is the biggest and the main palace in Seoul. So, ot is a must visit tourist attraction. Very crowded all the time, free entrance for visitors wearing traditional korean dress (Hanbok), that can be rented near the palace. Quieter areas are the walls surrounding the palace, with the pillars making the colorful walls and ornate ceiling beams more attractive for photos (instagram). Changing of the guard around 11:00am is also an interesting attraction to watch."
2138,4.0,The gate itself is impressive and the grounds are well with the entrance fee. The most interesting quirk were the dozens of girls who bring along traditional outfits to photograph each other with their friends and take selfies. Even the tourists get into it and there’s a costume hire place conveniently located near by. Had a lot of fun here simply people watching.
2139,4.0,"A large territory with lots of rather typical traditional buildings. Nevertheless, a great place to walk around and explore, getting away from the crowd. Talking about the crowd, we've been here on Monday, and while the main square was moderately crowded, most of the territory was not busy at all, and we could still find lots of places to take some nice pics in peace."
2140,5.0,"We visited the palace with our family and it's well worth the visit, however watch out for the school children. They come in their droves, but that's not a bad thing at all. It's lovely to see children learning about the local culture. It becomes difficult to take pictures at times though."
2141,5.0,If you are visiting Korea you must visit Gyeongbokgung! You can dress in Hanbok (Korean traditional dress) to gain free access to the palace. There are many Hanbok rental places just outside the palace which is convenient
2142,5.0,The scale of the Palace is amazing. On the day we went there were children dressed in traditional clothes celebrating a festival
2143,4.0,Beautiful palace. One of the largest I’ve seen. You can even dress up an the traditional Korean garb and take pictures. A lot of the locals seem to do this. Parking was easy and relatively cheap. Definite must see if in Korea.
2144,5.0,This palace has many buildings and extensive grounds. If you rent a traditional Hanbok costume (shops at exit 2 of the subway) entrance is then free. You can wander on your own or take a guided tour. We chose to go it alone and had a great time.
2145,5.0,It was a worthwhile site to visit enhanced by seeing the interesting changing of the guard ceremony and being entertained by the large numbers of visitors in rented costumes
2146,5.0,You will be surprise when you arrive in this place. The palace is so huge and you will feel that you live in Joseon dynasty era especially you wear tradional korea custum (Hanbook Cloth) and go around the palace. The hanbook cloth can be rented in nearby palace area.
2147,5.0,"We took an easy walk and got several nice photos. I think we spent there for almost 3 hours. As we went there in the morning (11), we managed to avoid the crowd what came afternoon."
2148,5.0,"A beautiful place one in Seoul for photo. Entrance fee is W3,000 but free for anyone who wear hanbok dress. The door close at 5 pm. Should have at least 3 hrs here."
2149,4.0,We got here at around 1pm just in time for the last Changing of Guards. Great to see part of Korea's history and culture. There were too many tourist at the time of our visit that it's too hard to take a photo without photobombers LOL.
2150,4.0,"We visited the palace at 5pm on a Monday. It was very busy but large enough to escape the crowds in the trails walking around the gardens. What wasn't great was from 5:30pm onwards, every 5 minutes, a loud voice over a speak system would usher us to the leave the palace asap as it was closing. This was the opposite of peaceful and made us feel like we were in some kind of theme park. I understand why this is necessary with 1,000s of visitors each day but if you're looking for a nice peaceful experience, I suggest you leave enough time to escape before 30 minutes before closing."
2151,5.0,"Nice view of the palace with the old and new, the changing of the guard and many people in costumes. It was friendly with a very nice walk and we had a good time even with our 9 year old. Lots of things to see and lots of pictures to take. Very nice walk."
2152,3.0,"I found this place to be initially beautiful, but it's really just a place for Koreans to get dressed up in traditional clothes and use the palace for their own personal photo shoots. Fun for about 10 minutes."
2153,1.0,"The ceremonies (including the changing of guards, guard inspection, guard training) were so boring, with most of them involving a group of men walking out in a line and/or walking around in circle before walking back.  Even the tour inside the palace ground and the actual buildings were completely underwhelming - especially when you've been to other palaces in Japan and China."
2154,5.0,"I traveled here with a friend of mine who used to live and teach English in Korea. She took me to the palace and I was blown away by how massive the grounds are, let alone the beautiful reconstruction of the architecture (sadly, only 10% has remained to this day). I dressed in the traditional hanbok attire and got in for free (although it cost me $20 for 2 hours just for the experience, otherwise it's 3,000 Korean Won or ~$3 for entry). It was neat seeing the ""changing of the guards"" which happens every hour in the enormous entryway before entering the palace itself. We went during the off-season, but it was still packed because it's Buddah's birthday in early May, so festivals and people were abound in preparation for it. I highly recommend visiting this palace over others for those who are baffled by the options."
2155,4.0,"We visited on a Monday when the quieter but by all accounts more authentic palaces were closed. Gyeongbokgung is definitely a must see when in Seoul but be prepared for there to be a lot of people, especially if it is a Monday and the alternatives are fewer. Allow around two hours to make the most of it and explore north of the main compound where the crowds become thinner."
2156,4.0,It’s a nice place and too crowded. It will be nice if you rent Hanbok for all your pictures but i didn’t do it coz when i see the crowd haha nvm. It would be bice if you come when cherry blossom blooms during last week of march first week of april. All in all it’s a nice experience in seoul
2157,4.0,"Family of 3 adults. Good weather! However, several parts of the Palace were closed for renovation including the Sojubang Kitchen - which was very disappointing :( However, it was also fun to see plenty of tourists dressed in the national Korean costume 'Hanbok'. They are available for hire from plenty of local 'costume' shops - and to see them just added to your imagination! Walking around is very easy and seeing the 'Guards' at the beginning with their flags flying in the wind was also lovely!"
2158,2.0,"I am sure this is not the grandest or most glamorous in South Korea. I was quite disappointed as this is said to be a must when in Seoul. Once you passed through the main gate, everything seems the same in every courtyard after each gate. The central building is also quite small, perhaps the dynasty was not a big one. We paid to go in as we were not wearing their transitional costumes, it was good that the fee was not expensive."
2159,1.0,Overcrowded and not free.  Bunch of people dressing the same way and taking selfies. IMO you can visit other great attractions in Seoul which are all free and less crowded.  There is also a lack of places to rest and get a break from the sun.  Take a picture and leave.
2160,5.0,"I decided to go by the day tour, you might miss the best part of this castle. I visit two times; one time with the day tour and the other time by myself.  In day tour, the guide will give you an explanation about the place, the history of the castle, and such. But then again,you have Google and every part of the castle have a short yet detailed explanation about it.  Without the day tour, we can go into more places that much more interesting for an international tourist like me. Places that day tour didn't show us, and walk slower, take more pictures.  Watch the time, if I'm not mistaken at 12.00 KST, they have a guard changing ceremony (show). Watch it, definitely worth of your time."
2161,4.0,Very large area to walk around & pretty much the same in each area.. bit hard to condense the tour here I guess but wished we could..
2162,5.0,Excellent place to visit for the history of Korea Free to enter the museum 3 floors of exhibits Easy to get to via subway
2163,5.0,"for first time visitors,try renting hanbok and explore the whole place while taking pictures.its hard to beat the crowd but there are parts of the palace that are less crowded..it took us maybe 2 hours to explore this wonderful palace while taking hundreds of pictures."
2164,1.0,"If you're a foreigner, you go into a foreigner-only queue where you pay a full-rate entry price to view the palace. If you are Korean, you go into a Korean-only line where you pay a special, discounted rate. This is typical of a foreigner vs. Korean mentality you find in many places in Korea, but it was surprising to experience this as a foreigner at such a big tourist destination."
2165,4.0,A very interesting experience. Good value for money and very easy to get to. Beautiful buildings and really well kept grounds.
2166,5.0,Only 3000 Won entry. £2 or $2.50 US. Very reasonable for entry to such a beautiful place. Changing of the gaurd takes place outside the charged section so it's completely free. The 10am one is less busy. Perfectly timed to then take the 11am English tour around the palace. We absolutely loved it. Informative and friendly lady who guided us around in perfect English with subtle humour also. Highly recommend
2167,5.0,"Easy walking, beautiful surroundings you can get into palaces free if you are in traditional dress, it was lovely to see so many doing this. It was a large palace but not too crowded"
2168,5.0,"This palace is in the same grounds as the Folk museum and, luckily I visited in Springtime when all of the cherry trees were in full bloom. It was built for the founder of the Joseon Dynasty, destroyed by the Japanese in the 16th century and rebuilt in the 19thC. It has four gates leading to it, the most important being the southern gate outside which there is daily a colourful changing of the guard ceremony."
2169,5.0,S. Korea has really revitalized this palace since I was a kid. We took the tour sponsored by the Korea Tourism Bureau.
2170,5.0,"When we went in December, it was getting cold but we chose to not wear jackets over our hanboks. It was the best decision! We took some stunning pictures and because it was colder, it wasn't too packed. I loved it!!"
2171,4.0,Was good experience to walk around the palace in hanbok and admire the cherry blossom and scenery. Have an enjoyable morning walking around with many photo taking places
2172,5.0,"Incredible palace. Totally different, then what we have in Europe. Mistical place full of the spirit of the old times. Great initiative of the young people to be the tour guide for free and in the same time to practice English. You can rent or buy the dresses from the royal family time, walk in palace and feel like a queen or king. Fully recommended for all families."
2173,4.0,"If you love museums, as we do, this is the place to go. The main event is the palace grounds. Though reconstructed, it give you an idea of royal life. Second, on the grounds (but I don't think you have to enter the palace to get there) is the National Palace Museum, which tells more of the story about what went on in the palace. Third, and my favorite, is the National Folk Museum, also free and outside the palace itself. This is where you learn how regular people lived - clothing, making kimchi, village life, etc. Finally, tucked away in a small building on the north perimeter is a library of material about the palace and the Josean Dynasty. All the signage throughout all the museums are in English."
2174,5.0,"The palace is huge and you can find lots of picture-worthy spots. For entrance, you ca choose to rent costumes (hanbok/traditional korean attire) or buy entrance tickets. If you choose to rent hanbok, entrance will be included already, this option however, is more expensive compared to the regular entrance fee but you get to experience wearing hanbok and you will definitely enjoy taking pictures with it. Recommended time is 1 to 2 hours depending on travel speed."
2175,5.0,When you stay in South Korea or you planning to travel you need to visit there. One of the history palaces...
2176,5.0,A really nice family morning visit to see Korean history and see the sights of an excellently well preserved set of ancient buildings.
2177,4.0,Very nice palace with an interesting museum describing the life of Korean people through different times. You can spend 2 hours to visit the palace and the museum.  The change of the guards is a must see. The tip from our guide is to wait outside to see the guards practicing before the official change inside the palace.
2178,5.0,Pensioners get free entry for a start.It is a large place to walk around and see the gardens and the lake.I watched a performance by the local band and dancers which was entertaining.You are not allowed in the palace grounds so the gardens is all you get.
2179,5.0,"Alot and alot of people were wearing traditional korean dresses, and it just made it very fun taking photos around. Great palace, with alot of people wearing traditional dresses made it complete . Loved my cruising around there...."
2180,5.0,I liked the preservation of their history and culture. I liked seeing locals and foreigners dressing up in their rented or purchased Hanbok . Inexpensive $5+ USD for two adults.
2181,5.0,"Just came back from an amazing trip to South Korea and one of the most impressive experiences was visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace. We received a discounted Senior entrance fee which can obtain by showing your passport.  The palace itself is massive and even though there were large crowds, we never felt crushed due to the expanse of this palace. Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of the visit, however, was experiencing the throngs of Korean people who dressed up in the traditional Honok attire. It was simply gorgeous and the pride in which the individuals wore there garb was evident. It truly takes you back in time when you see people in traditional dress and being on those grounds made it even more special.  A changing of the guard occurs every hour and that is fun to watch as well. When you finish that, make sure to walk the grounds entirely until you get to the National Folk Museum which is also on these grounds."
2182,5.0,We had a visit of the Gyeongbokgung Palace as part of a tour. We had a quick tour of the museum and the palace grounds and the changing of guards. Would love to go back to explore the entire place.
2183,5.0,Big temple Areal with a long history. But was destroyed while the conflicts. It’s very similar to the forbidden city in Beijing. Take a walk around and use the west entrance! It’s new and nobody’s there. Very close to the bus station with the same name.
2184,4.0,Try to go early in the day if you want to avoid the crowds. Explore the area in and around the Palace.
2185,4.0,"Visited the museum. Very interesting. Next time will consider renting the hanbok and go to palace to take photos. Apparently, entrance fee will be waived.  Need to spend at least 2 hours. Weather was cold in March so going into museum was a great idea!"
2186,4.0,"I enjoyed exploring the palace with the English guided tour. Since we were in hanbok, we got to enter the palace for free and it became much more meaningful as we learn more of the history. There were many photo opportunities and it was nice to catch the changing of guards demonstration."
2187,5.0,"This is definitely one the places you gotta visit if you’re going to Seoul, is such a very significant place. You can take pictures of the guards outside the palace, it’s a very huge place where you can fetch many things, at the back of the palace there’s a huge pretty garden, looks stunning when it’s nos autumn 🍂."
2188,5.0,"Myeongbokgung Palace is a place to see while in Seoul, you can rent traditional clothes in Habok rental store for $10 and have picture taken while inside the palace ground. Must to see is palace guard. Food is great and affordable. Close to korean Village."
2189,5.0,"We visited on a warm, clear day in April and the palace was like something our of a fairy tale with everything blooming and all of the people dressed in hanboks."
2190,5.0,"This Palace is one of the most popular historical places to visit in Seoul. Some korean dramas have shot scenes here too. There's an entrance fee if you're not wearing a hanbok (traditional Korean clothing). I recommend renting one, I think it adds up to the experience. And lots of tourists are wearing hanbok there when we went there."
2191,4.0,"This may be my second time to visit Gyeongbukgung, but the wonderfully preserved remnants of the Joseon Dynasty is still breathtaking. In stark contrast to the sweltering heat I experienced during my first visit; the chilly winds of early spring were the ones which accompanied me during this visit.  During my first visit, our sole focus was looking at the changing of the guards ceremony. In this visit though, the weather permitted us to take our time to go through the different structures within the compound. Due to time constraints though, we didn't have time to check out the National Folk Museum of Korea."
2192,4.0,The banqueting hall by the lake/large pond was the best feature of this Palace as the cherry trees were in bloom and the willows were well and truly weeping. The site overall is a pleasant spot with some nice reconstructed buildings giving a feel of how life was before the palace was destroyed by the Japanese. The changing of the guard at 10.am and 2pm is well worth timing the visit for and puts the British iof the Guard at Buckingham Palace into perspective. This is so much more colourful.
2193,5.0,We were lucky weather was perfect sun was out and the trees were in full bloom  Although there were lots of people becos the grounds were huge once inside you didn’t feel the crowd at all  Our family strolled slowly round and took lots of photos and just soaked in the whole atmosphere
2194,5.0,"Beautiful place, but try to visit it as early as possible (opens at 09:00), because there're too many tourists later. As all palaces have sth in common, you may need to visit only one or two."
2195,5.0,"Entrance fees is 3000 won per adult. Can easily spend one and a half hour walking around the palace. As it was drizzling, the imperial guards change process was cancelled. This palace is linked to the National Folk Museum of Korea. A must go in Seoul."
2196,5.0,"I went twice as I really enjoyed the visit. 3000 KRW for the entrance fees. I was there for the change of guards and that was a must-see. There also provide free guides for English, Chinese and Japanese at specific time. You need 2 hours to really enjoy all the sites. Totally worth it."
2197,2.0,"Very disappointed. Have seen better and more luxury royal residences in China, Thailand and elsewhere. Probably a must for a day in Seoul but half an hour is probably enough."
2198,4.0,The Cherry Blossoms were in full bloom and just added to how beautiful and well kept this palace was. This is a must see in the theater district of Seoul. You can even rent traditional dress(see picture) across the street to wear as you tour the various buildings that make up the palace area
2199,5.0,"This is the largest among all the palaces in Seoul. Two hours is not enough to cover and see this grand palace. Seeing the palace with the mountain as the backdrop was majestic. We went on a Sunday so the crowd was bigger. Tip 1 : It might be better to go on a weekday to avoid large crowd. Tip 2 : If you want to veer away from the crowd, proceed right away to the farther parts of the palace since most of the tourist remains at the front. We were blessed to witness the changing of guards at 2pm. I think they do this ceremony every 10AM and 2PM. If you want to witness a historical practice, don't miss this one. :)"
2200,4.0,"Vast complex, can be combined with other sights, such as folk museum and Bukchon Hanok village. Transport back to city on the Hanok side."
2201,5.0,"We visited Gyeongbokgung early in the morning in rented hanboks therefore received free entry. You needn’t feel self-conscious as nearly every other person was dressed in traditonal dress wandering and taking photos. The palace is the most beautiful one we visited and we were able to appreciate the beauty early in the morning when there was less crowds. You needn’t have a tour as you can wander the location yourself even there there were not a lot of explanation signs.  Be warned, as British tourists dressed in hanboks we were asked by many Asians for photos, so be prepared for pushy people and smile.  One of Seoul’s top attractions!"
2202,5.0,Palace area is huge. Highly recommended. Was short on time. Would suggest to keep 1 day only for Palaces..Worth visiting for 3000 K.wons per person.
2203,4.0,It was great to watch the changing of the guards ceremony & to wear the Hanbok traditional dress for the occasion. Lovely photos with the beautiful palace buildings & environment. Worth the visit.
2204,5.0,"Beautiful palace full of cultural touches. It was amazing to see tourists and visitors dressed up in traditional clothing while walking around the sites. However, some part of the park was under construction when we went. Would definitely recommend seeing and dressing up too (as long as we remain respectful towards the culture)"
2205,5.0,Used Color of Korea for our tour. Can't say enough how pleased we were treated. Ms Ju and her driver Oliver were very professional and it would not have been the same without them.
2206,5.0,"This a great palace with history. It is huge and wear comfortable shoes!!! You can take lot of photos in each corner . good views , good pics and dont forget to wear Hanbok dress because you can get in there for free!"
2207,5.0,"Okay so! When we haven’t really considered the fact that the day when we went to Gyeongbokgung Palace was on a Holiday! The place was pack with people. You can’t take picture without people busy passing by . On the entrance area people flocked from local tourist to foreigners to students who’s having their educational tour.  Most of the palace were closed, the one near it was closed that time. The palace is so big that you can just find spots for you to explore. However, popular spots are expected to be crowded.  Just see my photo!  ONCE AGAIN! Don’t go there on a holiday.  Photo edit by my friend Trinity Uy. Thanks for the cool picture ❤️"
2208,5.0,"Dont miss the Gyeongbokgung palace, the views are incredible. Check the times for changing the guards, it's a good way to start a visit."
2209,3.0,The old architecture in the backdrop of a modern city is lovely to see. While I enjoyed I went and saw it I wouldn’t go again . It’s peaceful place to hang out and look around for an hour or so that was good enough for me.
2210,5.0,We watched the changing of the royal guards and it was very fascinating. The costumes are outstanding! We had our pictures taken with the guards too while they stood at attention. It's worth a visit if you're in Seoul!
2211,5.0,You may spare a day to explore the whole location. Best spot is small lake (pond) inside the center area
2212,5.0,This is a much larger and more colorful attraction than I imagined. I do recommend visiting here in a rented Hanbok because the setting is just so gorgeous for photos and it is not an overcrowded site. However 2 hours is a standard minimum Hanbok Rental time from most shops near the Anguk subway station and it was just barely enough time to walk to place and through grounds. Rent for 4 hours! Entrance the palace is free - just walk through gate. We lucky to catch blooming cherry blossoms as well!
2213,3.0,"We walked the entire park. Beautiful buildings. No one there to talk about any of them. Cannot see inside at all. A few doors open to look at empty spaces with painted walls but most areas doors locked and cannot see inside. No furniture, no mats. Do not get a feel for how they lived many years ago. There is construction going on in some area which were completely blocked off. I was disappointed because I wanted a sense of how the family lived their lives during that time period. Only saw buildings."
2214,5.0,We where lucky to see special ceremony what happened only once a year. The place offers a free walking tours or for few dollars you can rent the audio headset. The place was absolutely beautiful. The cherry blossoms are just starting to bloom.
2215,3.0,"The switching of the guards is cool. The palace is large, lots of walking and little to see. We aren’t allowed to enter the the rooms but can see through the windows. Overall, I don’t care for it much."
2216,3.0,"This palace has been rebuilt after it was destroyed. We had a volunteer high school student do the tour with us, she did a really good job. Unless you really care for the history and don’t have better things to do then it is good to visit. The metro line gets you there so you don’t have to worry about directions. We had to wait for around 15 minutes for tickets. But, overall, it was an ok thing to do."
2217,5.0,"It only costs you around $3 per entry, however if you are 65 or older the entry is free. It is also free if you dress up in national costume. The changing of the guards is great to watch. It is twice a day at 10:00am and 2:00pm."
2218,5.0,Beautiful old charm surrounding with modern buildings in Seoul city. Gyeongbokgung Palace is very big area. Hanbok rental shops is located near to this palace.
2219,3.0,"Our view of the places was average, nice grounds and Wednesday were free because of Culture day. It was nice to scroll on lesiure day."
2220,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung palace, the obvious seat of government in older times, is a showpiece for the city, staring down at the city's main avenue through the reconstructed Gwanghwamun gate, giving it the proper sightlines so important in eastern palace layouts.  Being the main palace in Seoul, it features a number of displays, including performers in traditional dress showing various aspect of court pageantry. Also worth visiting is the folk museum within.  The detailing and shape of the roofs are unique, and the large number of carved stone figures, some of them unfortunately encased in transparent boxes due to unruly visitors, interesting indeed.  Lovely day !"
2221,4.0,Beautiful place with lots of angle to take photos. Palace guards changing ceremony and Gate Guard changing ceremony occurs at certain timings. You'll see people renting the Korean traditional costume for photos.
2222,5.0,"Very nice visit to a Palace from XIV Century from Joseon period. Try to get at specific hours to see guard change, its worth the Wait. You Can also rent a typical dress from the period and take great pics in this old and nice palace and buildings."
2223,5.0,"Just go. You won’t regret it. Even though it is in Seoul, I don’t feel as though I am in a metropolitan city at all, was like stepping back in time. Gorgeous with so much architecture and history to appreciate. Lots of other awesome things nearby to see and do such as The Blue House (White House equivalent). Dress comfortably, one can easily spend a while exploring. You can rent traditional Korean clothing (Hanbok) to wear when you visit from one of the nearby shops. See if you can catch the changing of the guard ceremony."
2224,5.0,The first palace built in the Joseon dynasty with over 500 years history. The impressive royal culture and palace life can be experienced.
2225,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is extremely huge, similar to some of the palaces in China. There are many places inside the palace to take amazing photos. There are small signs around the palace with brief descriptions of the buildings in the palace, however, the descriptions are not very detailed and if you are truly interested in learning more about the Gyeongbokgung Palace, you should probably follow the guided-tours.  There’s also a guard changing ceremony daily at 1000 and 1400 hours. The guard changing ceremony was pretty amazing, but be sure to arrive at the central area of the palace early to get a clear view of it."
2226,4.0,"we joined the translated guided tour,and it was definitely worth it! a free locker service is also available, very convenient !"
2227,4.0,Took photos here and went to the museum to understand a bit more about korean lifestyle and culture.
2228,3.0,"This was very easy to find on the train from Seoul. Large courtyards with many people who rented traditional Korean attire at the entrance and roamed the palace grounds. There’s a museum, cafe, and a separate center that demonstrated playing traditional instruments."
2229,4.0,"Beautiful place - unfortunately, they all take a selfie. on the one hand we see a lot of skyscrapers and on the other this humble side of Korea! the entrance cost $ 3 but the memories remain for a long time! we saw many traditional Korean dresses! It's worth seeing"
2230,5.0,"It didn't look as big from the outside as it really was. For only 3000 Won which is about $3US, it is very cheap and you can also go to the Korean Folk Museum for free which was also very interesting. You learn a lot about the Joseon dynasty."
2231,5.0,We could feel the history of the dynasty which are kept in very good condition. Proud people of this ancient culture.
2232,5.0,Once your are in Seoul is a must to go and visit the Gyeongbokgung Palace. This Palace is the biggest one in Seoul. Also there is a museum next to the palace.
2233,4.0,We spent a couple of hours visiting this palace where you can go from courtyard to courtyard to see various buildings. The queen’s quarter is interesting as well as the heating system they used in those days. There is a small cafeteria and souvenir shop within the palace area.
2234,5.0,this is thes best place to viti. very educational..once you step in you can really feel you are there during joseon time
2235,5.0,"This is when it hit me that I had finally made it to South Korea. The architecture was stunning, but my favorite part was the changing of the guards- the outfits, the armor, what an experience. You can't come to SK and not see the changing of the guards!"
2236,4.0,"You can enter this palace if you are wearing a hanbok.  Instead of entering via the main gate, we used the east gate coming from Bukchon Hanok Village."
2237,4.0,"This was part of our private tour and very interesting. It was a lot of walking, as it is a big area and we have mobility issues, but it was worth it. Our guide did a very good job of explaining the various buildings that comprised the palace."
2238,4.0,"I didn't find it so impressive, but it's a matter of taste. A lot to walk, it's a big area. I wish more informations in english."
2239,5.0,So easy to get to this place and very near to the subway. This place is just beside the National Palace Museum of Korea. You also can rent a hanbok and experience walk around the palace with a traditional hanbok of Korea
2240,5.0,The colourful event happens daily at 2pm where visitors experience live performances of changing of the city centred famous palace guards. Visitors are allowed to take pictures with the guards on duty just like the London’s Buckingham palace mannequin looking soldiers. Young Korean ladies would be seen wearing their cultural Hanbok dresses when visiting the palace area. It was a nice 12C bright sunny day during the Seoul city outing.
2241,4.0,"This Palace was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty built in 1395. The largest of the Five Grand Palaces built by the Joseon dynasty, Gyeongbokgung served as the home of Kings of the Joseon dynasty, the Kings' households, as well as the government of Joseon. Truly history comes alive with daily changing of the Imperial Guards at 10 am and 4 pm. A must see when in Seoul."
2242,4.0,"I went with my friends and so many people were wearing beautiful Korean traditional clothes. I heard there's a place that you can rent them. Anyway, I kind of wished that they have more signs or at least have QR codes or something to explain what the building was."
2243,5.0,"number one tip is to hire a Hanbok and get in for free. Loads of places to hire one, it cost around $13 for 2 hours. I hired one for 4 hours and had a ball. Being and older blondie, I copped a few stares and compliments, but had super fun. It is really a series of buildings that you wander around. Pretty wheelchair accessible, there are ramps over entrances etc. I highly recommend the museum that is attached. It is well set out and very interesting. I went with a Korean lad, but would have been fine to wander about solo. There is not a lot happening in the palace itself, more a wander through the building and complex. Still highly recommend this location."
2244,4.0,"Large spaces padding every gate. Nice old wooden architecture. Be prepared to walk. Quite a lot of Korean tourists, not only foreign."
2245,5.0,The place has plenty of water surrounding the old unique Korean architectural buildings and thus offer great venue for photo taking.  One interesting thing we observed was that some people were happy to hire traditional Korean costumes and move around the place and snapping photos in them! They did add a nice touch to the ancient surroudings!
2246,3.0,"I have been to Japan, Indonesia and Thailand with my family... I’m Sorry but the temples and palaces in South Korea are very simple."
2247,5.0,"It was snowing when we were there in winter feb , gosh this place is SO GORGEOUS! Stunning, when the floors are covered in snow. Beautiful!"
2248,5.0,Big and nice place to spend 3-4 hours You can see the most beautiful traditional clothes and I had an opportunity to see and hear amazing traditional singers
2249,5.0,"The entrance ticket was really cheap, maybe 3k₩ , and if you wear hanbok it’s free. Which is a nice experience, especially when the weather is warm. There are many hanbok rental places around Gyeongbokgung. Going there be prepared for some walking, it’s a very spacious place. Also, there’s a folk museum inside. It’s very near other places worth visiting, such as Insadong, the Blue House and other palaces."
2250,5.0,"We felt like princesses during this time when we visited Gyeongbokgung Palace despite the cold weather we manage to stay, smile and mesmerized of the beauty of the palace and its surroundings."
2251,4.0,We saw the ceremonial changing of the guards. Very colorful and well organized. Would have liked to see more of the inside of the palace.
2252,5.0,"Lovely day spent with our guide Stella & our mini bus driver. We visited Gyeongbok Palace which was amazing. Jogye Buddhist temple, dressed up in hanbok in Insadong which was fun. We got a little time to shop than we had a wonderful traditional Korean lunch. We visited Bukchon Hanok Village, went past the Blue House on our way to Bugak skyway that over looks the city of Seoul & finished in Myeongdong to shop. Stella was a terrific guide, warm & friendly, & she paced the day perfectly. The bus was clean & the driver very capable. I highly recommend this tour."
2253,5.0,"So I'd say what's a palace without its crew? When we visited GBK Palace, we rented out hanbok from a nearby store so we can truly feel what's it like to live like a Korean in the past. Although it's kind of uncomfortable, it's nice to experience it while we're there. The costume for men starts at 17k KRW for 2 hours. If you opt to add a headdress, that would be an additonal 5k KRW. For girls it's a little but more expensive, but hey, girls dress more than we do. Hahaha"
2254,4.0,A must visit historical attraction when in Seoul. Beautiful landscape and very well kept. Many photo taking opportunities.
2255,4.0,"the Palace was nice with large gardens, but in winter lots of areas where cordoned off and many of the buildings where closed. The change of the guard is at 9:30 and is a very nice complement"
2256,5.0,An interesting experience to experience by yourself. You can watch the Royal Guide Changing Ceremony and I was chosen to be the lucky one to knock the gong. Im so happy.
2257,3.0,"If you've been to a few palaces in Asia and in South Korea, you will feel like you have seen it all.  The area is paid to enter and there is quite a lot to see and luckily most of the displays have English so you can read about the history.  However we felt that the area was a bit sparse in terms of things to do and did not really wow me compared to the other sites of Seoul.  Be prepared to walk around for a couple of hours to cover most of the palace grounds."
2258,3.0,"That place a bit disappointing me. Most of buildings are basically replica and quite new. Off coutce there is reason why so, but still. Area is big and it is nice place to escape busy city. But at end of a day, it is just another Palace made for tourist attractions."
2259,5.0,Majestic Palace. Enjoyed the changing of guard ceremony. Dressing in Hanbok to tour around the Palace is an experienced not to be missed!
2260,4.0,I was lucky enough to arrive in time to see the changing of the guard . Colourful experience . Photo op with one of the guards who looked a little scary . Lovely walking around the grounds and seeing all the people walking around in traditional dress which can be hired locally . I think there is a discount for wearing it too
2261,4.0,This is nice palace but no remarkable because their architecture is boring. But Korean advertise their culture is very good with free ticket if wear hanbok. I appreciate it
2262,5.0,"Great experience, the guard change is really interesting. The contrast with the modern city, build just some steps away, make it more interesting"
2263,4.0,"I have been to Korea 5x now and I'm never ceased to be amazed by all the museums and historical sites! Anyway, this was my first time here and the site is quite large with expansive grounds, displays, and monuments to explore. You could easily spend a few hours here. If you're a fan of historical Kdramas, this would be a place to visit! Just to note, I was here during Korean New Year's (2/3 through 2/5?) and there was no changing of the guard ceremony. Also, aside from Myeongdong, many of the malls and underground shops were closed or partially open."
2264,5.0,"Our guide met us just after the changing of the guards, and took us on a full tour of the palace. She was really knowledgeable, and her English was excellent. I highly recommend this tour, and others provided by Seoul City Walking Tours as well!!"
2265,5.0,It is not an abundance of things to do or see but it is really cheap and kind of cozy to stroll around in the gardens amongst the temples. And sitting in front of the mountains it is a pretty scenic.
2266,4.0,"You can see the culture and Heritage of Korea by visiting this place, Korean Royal Food and Traditional Dance , this Palace is near the lake and mostly crowded with travellers and visitors from various placed"
2267,5.0,Great views and tons of places for photos ... but there were too many visitors and you could hardly take nice photos ...
2268,3.0,The reconstructed site is a nice place to go for a walk but apart from the nice surroundings it lack interesting appeal.
2269,5.0,"Explored the palace twice actually. It was nice but everything is restored according to my friend. But still, it is very beautiful"
2270,5.0,Opportunity to go back in time and enjoy the history of South Korea. Wonderful experience. Enjoy wonderful day of exploring and a tasty local lunch. Food cost in Korea is very inexpensive compared to USA. Can afford to eat out everyday.
2271,4.0,If you are into lots of walking and in big groups will be nice. There are performances and was crowded but nice to see travellers in HanBoks. Good location to shoot documentaries and vlogs.
2272,5.0,"Joseon Kingdom Palace. One of the nicest looking palace. This is like the miniature of Forbidden Kingdom, smaller, but you don't need to spend a lot of time visiting all the places, 3-4 hrs are enough.  Better to visit around 1.30pm, and see that changing of the guard procession at 2pm and enter the palace afterwards.  You can also see plenty of visitors wearing Han Bok, although mostly are not koreans. But if you manage to find a pretty one, don't hesitate to ask for a picture. Hehehe"
2273,4.0,Saw the changing of the guard on a minus 13-Celsius day but that didn't spoil the spectacle. The National Museum of Korea is right next door too and the subway stops right at the palace.
2274,4.0,"I went here with my friend. It was a very nice experience. The palace is so beautiful, and there are things to do and see here too. You can do traditional arts and crafts, watch make-believe guards standing near by, and stroll along and take picture with King Sejong's beautiful statue. It is in front of the main gate, before you enter the palace. Also, you can see the Blue House from a distance. The Blue House is like the White House in the US, where the President lived and worked, or hold government meetings. It was nice to see. It is just across from the palace. I can see guards standing nearby. Pretty impressive!!!"
2275,5.0,"Came on a guided tour. If not must join one of theirs (English ones 11.30 & 2.30 Mar-Dec Korean ones on the hour)The history is fascinating, as is the palace.Beautiful gardens. Enjoyed the two museums as well. Loved seeing the young people of many nationalities enjoying walking around in traditional Korean dress. Very sorry I missed the changing of the guard as didn't know about it until I read a review later  Came on a ship's tour, which we all thought was very poor value, ($159) although it was easy being driven round the sights..Better to research to get the metro."
2276,5.0,Really enjoyed visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace. Covers a massive area so be prepared to walk and dress warm during winter . If you time it right you can watch the ceremonial changing of the guards(about 20 minutes). Also head to the back area so you can see the Blue House where the President resides. The property is kept very clean and organized. Was amazed to see the traditional dresses or “ Hanbok “worn by the female visitors. Bathrooms were spotless clean and nice. Great stop to see while in Seoul
2277,5.0,A historical place must visit for first timer in Seoul. Huge landscape and admiring the buildings that much influenced by Chinese.
2278,4.0,"But maybe better in another season, like spring or fall. Went in December a few years ago, and the landscaping was pretty bare because of the frigid temperatures (Korea gets cold in winter), and I imagine it must be pretty spectacular in either spring or fall.  Enjoyed walking around the grounds, and there are plenty of great places for photos even in the winter. Wish I would have gotten tour guide or one of those personal tour things, but was in a rush and did what I could in the limited time we were there. Would be a great place for a picnic (not sure if that's allowed though).  Would definitely go back if it wasn't December."
2279,5.0,The architecture is amazing and well preserved its like being taken back in time or being part of an epic kdrama...but the highlight is watching the changing of guards the ceremony in itself is a definite must when visiting this place...
2280,4.0,"It’s very beautiful place with castle and some garden. Also very popular for tourist and field trip students and kids! I saw many people wearing korean traditional dress, heard the entry fee is free if you wear those!"
2281,5.0,"It is a pride of our nation, But it is a shame when lose our country, But we hope it will be a lesson for our next generations."
2282,4.0,"One of the 5 grand palaces built by kings of Joseon dynasty, Gyeongbokgung Palace offers a good glimpse of Korean tradition and history. The complex is huge and seems to always full of people wearing Hanbok. Well worth 1-2 hour visit. Stay longer if you want to take a royal tea ceremony or learn to make rice cake."
2283,5.0,"Large palace complex - the traditional wood buildings are beautifully painted with geometric floral motifs. The main throne room is beautifully decorated. Be sure to see changing of the guards ceremony, held twice, at 11am and 2 pm. It is a lot of fun with a lot of pageantry. The guards dressed in colorful traditional clothes, carry weapons and try to look fearsome. They are accompanied by a military band and other guards/men carrying colorful standards. The guards are very popular photo props."
2284,5.0,Your visit to Seoul Korea is not complete unless you visit the Palace wearing the traditional dress called Hanbok while walking around the Palace and witness the changing of the guard.
2285,5.0,"I’ve been living in Korea for almost 5 years now, and I still visit the palace on a regular basis. Mainly when visitors come as a major site for them to see, but it never ceases to amaze me. It’s stunning and takes a good long while to walk around and take in the beauty, and for only 3,000₩ it’s a great deal for something to do on a low budget."
2286,5.0,"A beautiful palace indeed. I personally enjoy historical thing, so I was really happy with my visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace. The place is very big, so you have to prepare yourself with long walk if you want to see everything. Nad they offer free english guided tour at specified time for around 1.5 hours which I think quite worth it."
2287,5.0,Get to the palace early to catch the first change of guards ceremony. There are also tour guides in the different languages that will bring you round the palace. The tour guide we had was hilarious and made the tour even more enjoyable.
2288,4.0,The palace is a very popular with locals and tourists and things were very busy when we were there. The grounds are extensive and well worth a leisurely stroll. The buildings have been lovingly maintained and are in excellent condition - they don't show their age (built in 1300s) at all!
2289,5.0,"We went on December 30 and the weather was cold but sunny. We went early in the morning as we purchased a hambok rental experience that said we needed to be there between 9:30 and 10:30. If you want to do the rental and see the palace, I do recommend going earlier to beat the crowds. The palace is massive! When I watch K-dramas, these palaces are featured, but I didn't imagine how large the property would be. The buildings themselves are impressive. There are a few showcases of rooms that you can view from the outside. There was also a cafe and restrooms available. It was just fun to walk around in costume and take beautiful and memorable pictures. I read the other reviews that recommended the changing of the guard. The one at 10:00 a.m. was cancelled when we were there, but we were able to view the one at 2:00 p.m. It was quite colorful and beautiful to watch. It lasts for about 20 minutes. If you have time, explore Bukchon Hanok Village on your own afterwards, as it isn't far and it's a beautiful walk around the neighborhood. If you can, time it just before sunset. It's gorgeous."
2290,4.0,"A huge place, to start with. I was in their hanbok so I got free entry. If you chose to wear traditional korean outfits, you are entitled to a free entry in to not only Gyeongbokgung, but Changedeokgung, Changyeonggung and Jongmyo Shrine. (Those were the places I went.) Didn't had enough time to actually explore the entire Gyeongbokgung but would come back for more - leisure strolls!"
2291,5.0,"A beautiful Temple, well kept and offering a good half day's experience. Multiple photo opportunities."
2292,3.0,December is extremely cold in Seoul and regrettably limited our ability to enjoy the experience.  We did however enjoy the changing of the guards.
2293,4.0,"This Is the biggest palace at Seoul, so, really the only one you need to visit. Palaces at South Korea are just not as impressive as in Japan, so, i think a visit to one is sufficient."
2294,5.0,"Several buidings to see, also big grounds with a lake. There are occasional guided tours, or you can just wander."
2295,5.0,The Gyeongbokgung Palace is a must when visiting Seoul. The Palace is easily accessible within the city and very well maintained. You can rent the traditional Korean dress and go for a walk around the premises. The Palace covers a large area and you would be able to visit different premises within the Palace which offers a close encounter with the Palace history and Korean culture. Take your time and walk around while taking some pictures it would be time well spent.
2296,4.0,"I just had a couple of hours for my self after a long meeting, then I have decided to visit this amazing Palace ."
2297,4.0,"Nice grounds to see. Some areas were closed for restoration when I went. Make sure to be there for the changing of the guard ceremony.  A lot of it is outdoors, so if you're coming in winter, be prepared. A lot of visitors stopped by the gift shop / cafe to warm up for a bit."
2298,5.0,"Korea has maintained a single nation state for 5,000 years. It is a country that has never been invaded by other countries while suffering invasions of foreign powers."
2299,4.0,"The Palace is in fact a complex of buildings and gardens, with space in between. Closed on Tuesdsay! Can be easily explored in a few hours. The buildings are relatively new, much was destroyed in the many wars of Korea, but have been rebuilt in style. The changing of the guards near the entrace gate is a colourful spectacle, a few times of the day. Check for timing. Some of the buildings are in fact large halls, with colourful paintings and some sculptures, that one can look at from the outside, but not enter. Other buildings can be wandered through; those are spare and not very interesting. The museum for Folk Art is part of the complex, with separate admission. When finished with the palace, one can walk (approx. 20 minutes) to the Bukchon Hanok Village, a collection of relatively well preserved (often renovated) traditional houses along narrow lanes. Very tourist oriented and often crowded, but somewhat pleasant to wander through. Many craft shops for buying souvenirs."
2300,4.0,"This Palace, the largest is one of the main tourist attraction in Seoul. Gyeongbokgung or G Palace is said to have been built during 1395, boosts of more than 7500 rooms and spread over 40 hectares. This Palace served as the main place of residence for Kings of Joseon Dynasty, the nobles and the government servants before most part of it was destroyed by fire during the war with Japan. However, the temple complex has been gradually restored after the war by the later kings of Joseon Dynasty and the Government over the years. Today this palace also houses the Korea’s National Palace Museum and National Folk Museum. This is a massive Palace complex needs at least 4-5 hours to have a decent look inside. Plan your visit so that you do not miss the “Change of Guard Ceremony” which is conducted twice a day. And if you are interested to wear the Korean Traditional Costume, you can get the same on rent here."
2301,4.0,"Went here with one of my kids and my mom. Not sure how we would feel about it if we had to pay but we lucked out with free entry as it was the last Wednesday of the month as part of Culture Day. We walked around for about 2 hours and had enough. On the way out we saw another museum, the National Folk Museum of Korea, with free entry and had a wander through there. Could have spent hours there but had other plans."
2302,4.0,We visited the palace just in time for the changing of guards ceremony which was interesting. The architecture of the gates and the palace was a nice change
2303,1.0,"This is a sad replica of the Forbidden City in China. The litter around the place is depressing, too. Save your money and go to Beijing instead."
2304,5.0,"I would say this place has been the most enjoyable for me throughout my trip in seoul. Very nice and well maintained palace which says a lot about the history of koreans. From 10am to 4pm, there is also a changing guard ceremony which should not be missed. I have also heard that if you wear a hanbok, entrance is free! Do check it out if you visit Seoul!"
2305,5.0,"I accidentally joined the free guided tour they provided, and didn’t regret it at all. It’s definitely a must visit place when you’re in Korea."
2306,5.0,This place brings so much traditional feels for the millenials. I also recommend wearing hanbok while visiting this place to give you more superb traditional experience
2307,4.0,"Not really a review of the place but for those who wants to wear/try hanbok, the Korean traditional dress.  Just to let you know that they are available from 5,000KRW. If you ever found one, which costs around 20,000KRW — RUN. Because you will regret it.  My friends and I rented one for 20,000KRW. We were dressed with the more ‘normal’ ones as opposed to the commonly rented ones which looked soooo good.  The place is good for photoshoot while wearing the hanbok."
2308,1.0,"Place was so boring. It was freezing and it had literally nothing there. There were costumes for you to wear, but definitely not worth your time :/"
2309,5.0,This palace is beautiful and there is much more to it if you go to the back and around the property. Look for the small lake and take instagramable pictures.
2310,5.0,went here in winter and i got to see the pond frozen which looked truly magical !! my family and i enjoyed visiting the palace
2311,4.0,Nice to see that this place is well maintained so people can really appreciate one of Seoul’s main tourist spots.
2312,4.0,The design and artefacts inside the museum are well thought out. You can either read the signages or rent an audio self-guide @ 1000W. Entry to the museum is free but you need to pay to enter the palace grounds.
2313,4.0,Good place to walk around for an hour or two and see how the palace was organized. All outdoors so dress appropriately for weather.
2314,4.0,The area is pretty large so it takes at least two hours to go it thru. I recommend to take a guided tour at least for a some time to hear some important things about the place and the Korean history as well.
2315,3.0,"The palace is rich in history and culture if you’re a history buff. Walking around in the freezing cold was quite difficult because I was with my 72-year-old mom and brother with arthritis. However, it’s a must-visit place in Seoul and we were lucky to witness the ceremony of changing of the guards."
2316,5.0,The palace has free tours of the grounds with narration in English. It was really interesting to get views of how Korean royalty lived.
2317,3.0,"Since much of Korean culture was destroyed by the Japanese, all the buildings in the palace are replicas of actual buildings. Interesting if you are a history buff but not particularly impressed with the structures themselves."
2318,5.0,"Hello , Great place to visit suggest you should see guard change and wear traditional clothes . Recommend highly"
2319,4.0,Wonderful place to visit and explore. Good to read up about the place before visiting as that would add to the appreciation of the place..
2320,5.0,"The lake was frozen when I went in February but it was absolutely gorgeous. Learned alot about the history of Korea. The explanations are available in Korean, English, and Mandarin. Also visited the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang Special Exhibition ""Wintering"" at one of the museums. I remember wishing there were more food options."
2321,4.0,4/5 only because the construction at the ticket booth continued during the ceremony. Very clean and historic.
2322,5.0,Very highly recommend.  Amazing tour. Make sure you attend the guard switching ceremony.  Better visitor with a guide to learn about the history.
2323,4.0,The Royal Palace is a short distance walk from our hotel. It was very busy on our day of the visit but the palace area is vast so have plenty of areas to move and walk about and don't really feel crowded. There are many individual 'gates' within the complex but they are all spread out including some in the quiet corners too.
2324,5.0,"Beautiful, historical palace -a photographer's dream setting! A must see in Seoul! Not expensive! Get there early to beat the crowds!"
2325,5.0,"Good place for photo memories nothing much to do only to watch the show small show , across the road one shop you can rent the traditional custom per hour and you go inside the place and enjoy taking photos"
2326,5.0,"The place is quite big, but guide maps are provided as well as English tours (we just walked around on our own, it was good enough). The performances are VO-ed in English and Mandarin.  As we walked along the corridors, scenes from K period dramas I've watched flashed before my eyes haha! Most of the buildings are not the original (no thanks to the Japanese occupation during the war) but rebuilt. They are absolutely beautiful, with gorgeous artwork and minute attention to detail. Later, I watched Monstrum and when they mentioned the name of the hall, I told myself, hey! I've been there!  Oh we saw a few Korean young ladies dressed in beautiful hanbok taking pictures? videos? in some of the quieter grounds. Not sure what they were trying to achieve but they were taking turns to run down a stretch and turn around or something. Rather interesting and funny, hee."
2327,4.0,"Great picturesque location, even in winter months as water becomes iced and trees shed leaves. Enjoyed the time out with the family.  Downside for visits in winter months is that the place is all outdoors. Limited heating areas (only the cafe close to exit). Otherwise a good place for learning Korean history and taking beautiful pictures with the mountains in the background of the palace."
2328,5.0,"A palace located in the central of the city of seoul, very easy to get here by MRT there is special exit of this area, inside there the local guide wearing korean traditional will give u the explanation of this site, you can also take a foto using the korean traditional custom inside here. Culture parade will be held here but I forget the start time Recommended place for your holiday in seoul"
2329,4.0,"This is my 2nd time visiting the palace. But this time around, i had the chance to suit up myself and my daughter in the traditional Hanbok costume. Walking with the lovely costume to the Palace gives us a brand new experience. Plus, my daughter had fun time with some of the tourists whom was excited to capture her pic in the costume. Nice historical place!"
2330,5.0,"Beautiful place, which closes at 17:00  So plan accordingly for your visit and enjoy the most of it.  Rafael"
2331,5.0,"Well worth the visit, you can feel the history in the place and it's amazing seeing lots of people in the traditional dress .. it's almost like stepping back in time"
2332,3.0,"You will consider the Gyeongbokgung Palace a average asian palace if you've been to Imperial Palace / Forbidden city in China or Angkor Wat in Cambodia. Hence, don't expect too much once you enter the Gyeongbokgung compound. If your main purpose is just to take pictures, you can spend a max of 4 hours roving around the palace. The highlight of our visit in Gyeongbokgung is the changing of guards which is scheduled every 9AM and 2PM."
2333,5.0,"The palace grounds are massive. You can spend hours walking around Gyeongbokgung Palace. Lots of interesting architecture and statues. Palace was under some construction at the time but didn't take away from the experience. Lots to see so give yourself a couple hours at least. The Museum inside the palace grounds has a lot of exhibits to see as well. If you're a fan of history, this is a must see."
2334,4.0,"To be fair, all the buildings that we can see today are accurate replica. The original palace was burnt to ground in 1592. Several buildings were restored in 1890s, while the rest were reconstructed in last 20 years. So, the palace actually contains less historical value compares to Changdeokgung and Deoksugung.  However, the Gyeongbokgung is the original ruling palace of Joseon Kings. That attracted us to visit the palace, to see to prosperity and greatness of the Korean Dynasty at its best.  The palace is huge, so allocate at least one to two hours to walk around the compound while enjoy the beauty of the gardens, especially in autumn. Wearing comfortable shoes can ensure a good time walking through the ground with sand and uneven stone tiles. There are a few stairs to climb as well.  Checking the weather forecast is important so that we can bring an umbrella in case of raining. We found only one cafe available at the souvenir shop. So we need to bring enough water to keep us hydrated if we are planning to stay long in the palace."
2335,3.0,"As important as this palace is in the list of national treasures of South Korea, it's actually quite a boring place to visit full of empty buildings, except for the throne room and the changing of the palace guards. Wish they had filled those buildings with some kind of exhibits to reflect the glory of this palace. I had to get a sense of the magnificence of the palace during its glory days in the National Palace Museum instead."
2336,4.0,a nice place but crowded with tourists. walk through the museum and you will notice that it's actually a good place to see the korea history. the and etc
2337,4.0,"Had so much fun touring this palace, imagining the drama and intrigues within its walls! You MUST, I repeat, MUST plan to visit first a hanbok rental place nearby and enjoy wearing this traditional costume while visiting the palace. This made the visit especially memorable and fun.  PROS: * Super-fun wearing hanbok (traditional Korean costume) while visiting the palace * Free entrance into the palace, while wearing hanbok. * Lots of opportunity for photos in this historic place, while wearing traditional costume.  CONS: * Chilly in November (40F), but manageable * Hanbok rental costs more than palace admission, but hey, it's fun. * Did not rent the audio tour because my husband said it wouldn't match his costume (hahaha!), but would have added much to the tour.  Rented hanbok for 3-4 hours because hate to rush back, but we only took 2.5 hours because it was chilly and any longer would not have been necessary."
2338,4.0,"If you’re a fanatic for ancient Goryeo history, probably this will be a good place for you to play princess/prince/queen/king for an afternoon. You’ll be able to rent Hanbok over there and you can take incredible photos with the setting and the costume. Personally I think winter season will be a better time to come as the palace and the snow will make your picture perfect. :)"
2339,4.0,Amazing view during late November. The palace was covered in snow when we went so many photo opportunities from outside to inside. Didn't get to finish exploring though cause boyfriend's sports shoes got soaked in puddle from the melted snow...so a heads up to those planning to go to wear proper winter shoes or else you're going to have frozen feet the rest of the walk.
2340,5.0,Beautiful and scenic also saw the changing of the guard . Please check the website for timing . Must visit to see the scale of the place
2341,4.0,"We made our way here on a Saturday morning, and it was very cold in winter. The palace ground is large and very grand. Definitely a good opportunity to take many photographs and worth a visit if you have time."
2342,5.0,"Stately, commanding buildings. Beautiful lake and pavilion. Mountain views, symmetry. Intricate detail, great line of sight."
2343,5.0,"We had the pleasure of taking a 2nd trip to Seoul where there is a free transit tour offered by Incheon airport to promote tourism. We stopped in Gyeongbokgung Palace and it was simply amazing. From the ornate designs throughout the various structures to the citizens adorned in traditional dress, it was a great experience from beginning to end. Our tour guide Heejay provided great detail on the history of Korea & of the palace. We will certainly return to spend more time in Seoul & explore all that it has to offer!"
2344,3.0,"There are 5 palaces in Seoul, we visited Gyeongbob Palace as recommended the best among the 5. The tour guide told us that most of the palaces are rebuilt because they were burnt down during world war II. I'm not impressed of this best palace. It looks fake. Cannot compare with those I saw in China and Japan. Can give it a miss unless you want to kill time."
2345,4.0,"Those who loves the history and have exploration anxiety must visit. The guided tour in different languages is available and it is worth. Yes, it is free but have some fixed timing. How it is still under the redevelopment stage and have great plans for it. Thx"
2346,5.0,A must visit place if you are in Seoul. It's in the middle of the city area and you see a lot of tourist wearing Korean traditional Hanbok. There are shops that you rent Hanbok just outside the palace.
2347,5.0,This is the largest palace of 5 in Seoul. Free entrance for whom wear hanbok. Without hanbok the ticket is 300won.
2348,3.0,"Small and nothing much to see. I expect that the palace is more or less like the forbidden city in Beijing, but a bit dissappointed after visiting gyeongbokgung palace."
2349,5.0,This is one of the major palaces in Seoul with a beautiful pond in the middle of the palace that is one of my favourite photo spots in town whenever I have visitors to the city.
2350,4.0,This palace is the historical place. We can learn real history and ancient culture of Korea. I would like to recommend to visit this palace at least once who want to understand the Korean history.
2351,5.0,A great experience & great scenery. Enjoyed the nice photographic scene. Do rent a traditional Hanbok nearby to experience the Joseon era aura
2352,5.0,"The palace with great history, please accompany with Guide, and have the opportunity to know the history, the people of Korea are extremely good."
2353,4.0,The palace was 10 minutes walk from the Four Seasons and we could see it from the hotel itself. We were fortunate enough to catch the first snow of the season overnight so awoke to a blanket of 2-3 inches of settled snow.  The walk to the palace took longer due to the conditions and the visit to the palace made a little more magical by the white out effect. Ordinarily there isn’t too much to see but we dawdled to admire the scene even though it was cold.  Felt a little sorry for the guards in costume - hopefully they were suitably dressed underneath.
2354,4.0,Just outside the front gate is Gwanghwamun Square and the statue of King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sun-Shin. The palace itself is a nice visit. Try to see the changing of the guards if you can. This palace is one of five found in Seoul. Definitely worth a visit.
2355,4.0,I loved the palace. Must visit this palace if you’re in Seoul. It’s the most historical place in South Korea.
2356,5.0,The grounds of the palace is huge which cannot be covered in half a day. The scenery is beautiful and breathtaking! Shops offering hanbok rentals are many nearby. Visitors to the palace in their hanbok bring back visions fr the royal era.
2357,4.0,"If you wear a Hanbok, you get to enter the palace for free. It's a very huge palace with majestic architecture. They have free guided tours too."
2358,5.0,"Acclaimed as the most beautiful palace in Seoul, Gyeongbokgung does measure up to its reputation. With over half a century of existence it encompasses a large area with many buildings and pavilions. I paid USD 10 for entrance and audio guide and spend 3 hours exploring the palace. Despite the large number of tourists, students and locals dressed in typical outfits posing for pictures, one doesn't get the feeling of being crowded. Many buildings were reconstructed to its original design and are very well preserved. I thought the audio guide to be very useful given that there were not many descriptive boards. If you have little time to visit Seoul - as in my 14 h layover - this is the place to visit."
2359,5.0,"I wish I had allowed myself more to explore this palace's halls. However, the short time I was there well whetted my palate to know more about Korean dynastic history. Picturesque, colorful, and ripe with color, texture, and imagery."
2360,5.0,"Aside from being a popular place for historical dramas, being in Gyeongbkogung took us back to the old times. I really loved how we were able to experience walking around it and just mesmerized by the structure, culture and history that it holds and represents. The details on the palace, the intricacies in the designs is just awesome."
2361,5.0,"No stop in Seoul would be complete without a visit to the former imperial palace, and, for such, you will require to leave at least 2 to three hours for a complete visit.  The palace complex consists on several inner buildings as well as a Korean history museum at the very rear of the palace.  As with most traditional historical Korean building, most of the ground consist of gravel, so wheelchairs and strollers will require extra effort to move through it. Most of the buildings are located a few steps above ground.  When planning your visit, you should check in advance the times for the changing of the guard, which, by itself, is quite a colorful sight."
2362,4.0,Very interesting place. I'm sure it is even more beautiful in the summer months. Only wish there were more signs in English explaining the various buildings. Saw many locals going into the buildings to pray but we weren't sure if tourists were allowed and if they were what the protocol was to enter. We didn't want to be ride or inappropriate and enter so we just admired the beauty from the outside.
2363,4.0,"It's a great palace, like any other I suppose. I tend to imagine what it was like living in a place like that centuries ago while roaming around. Do swing by.I had a good experience."
2364,3.0,Supposed to be the largest. Not that impressive but restoration effort is still on-going. The changing of the guard held at the main gate added to its appeal
2365,3.0,I came here on Sunday noon. There are loads of visitors however you can manage some space in the palace grounds.  All the buildings are new since the original were destroyed. It was a really pity.  The grounds aren’t huge so you can cover it within 2 hours.
2366,3.0,Nice still through the park.Model of the ancient Palace.The Impression May be better when the Grass is Not Brown and Dry as it was.
2367,4.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is quite a huge place, with museums inside that describes about the history of ancient Korea. The entry to the palace is free when you wear their tradtional clothes, ""hanbok"". Do remember to check the days the palace is closed before going!"
2368,4.0,If you are into history of ancient and modern Korea. You can pay a visit. You need to pay to get into the main palace. But the museum itself is free. Inside you can learn about the history of Korea.
2369,4.0,"It was a big palace, although i was not able to visit the inside, to see the interior and the activities. But in general, if you had more time then maybe..."
2370,5.0,This palace seems to go on and on and continues to amaze. The grounds are incredible and the self guided tours (headset and map) are helpful and informative.  One really fun thing is that if you dress in traditional Korean clothes entry is free.
2371,5.0,Excellent historical place to visit. Interesting architecture. There are many hanbok rental shops nearby the palace...a lovely sight seeing tourists all wearing hanboks...view is like straight from the movie set of an ancient korean drama.
2372,5.0,Gyeongbokgung palace with it’s various buildings is an interesting place to walk around and explore. It was the main palace of the Joseon dynasty. It not only served as a home of the kings but also the government of Joseon. The palace has been destroyed several times and restored.
2373,4.0,"This is without doubt the highlight of Seoul, which you shouldn’t miss out. It is not a spectacular as the forbidden city in Beijing but (at least when we visited) also not as crowded. Many Korran people (and touristsaswell) love to rent historical clothes in one-off the shops around the palace, so you will see many people in traditional dresses."
2374,4.0,My first introduction to Korean history was a relaxed walk in the palace grounds. I opted for the English language audio guide. Saw the change of guards and enjoyed seeing the many visitors in traditional outfits. I appreciated the effort to preserve Korean culture and present wonderful examples of architecture.
2375,4.0,"The Palace full of beautiful autumn scenery but also have renovation at major attraction, so cannot fully experience whole beauty of the Palace. The experience of wearing the costume is unforgettable and the changing ceremony also interesting. Not to be miss."
2376,4.0,My boyfriend and I had a great afternoon strolling around the grounds of the Palace. Even though it was a busy day the grounds are so big you barely notice. We had the headset for a self guided tour which made it great for zigzag through and finding some less traveled sections. Beautiful architecture was great for pictures. Really enjoyed our time at the palace.
2377,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace was the first of many temples I visited around Seoul. This one was definitely the largest and most crowded. I was here during the week so there were a lot of school groups and tours. Admission is really cheap and they do tours as well. I opted to explore by myself, and really tried to experience the history. Unfortunately a lot of the palace was under construction when I went, so I could not see 100% of it. There were so many other buildings and alleys to walk around and see, I was still here for a couple hours. I really enjoyed the scenic mountains in the background, made for some great photo opportunities."
2378,4.0,One of the 4 palaces in Jongmyo. Good place for photos and it is huge. Happen to also witness protests going on outside the palace.  Pretty unique experience and ticket is affordable. Just that a lot of walking to do.
2379,4.0,"It’s pretty cool here! Walking around the grounds of the palace, and it’s pretty big too so can spend a good 1-2 hours here. Make sure you come right when they open to avoid the crowds! However the downside is we went to the dessert place inside the palace and wanted to order the “royalty” sweets set, and they told us it won’t be ready until afternoon time. They also offered free guided tours at specific times in different languages throughout the day!"
2380,5.0,"The tour to the palace will give you insights of Korean history, particularly the monarchy. We had a great tour guide, Sharon Yi of VIP travel who gave us detailed historical accounts of Korean Peninsula history and the dynasty that once led the monarchy.  The Changing of the Guards was also an interesting experience. Although it was in a smaller scale than what I have seen in other countries, it's always good to witness this spectacular display of a nation's culture. The concept and mechanics are similar as in other countries, but the uniforms are different. Fun colors, interesting style.  Palace tour takes a lot of walking. Palace grounds is a work in progress. Since most of it was destroyed during the war, the government is trying to rebuild, replicate and preserve whatever is left of it."
2381,4.0,This is a good place and needs to be in your itinary if you want to see culture or relates to art. It could be crowded so need choose your time very carefully.
2382,4.0,"Overall, we enjoyed our visit to Gyeongbokgung palace which served as the household of the Joseon dynasty. The grounds are beautiful and the architecture intriguing. The tickets were reasonably priced and there are free English tours a couple times a day- ours was at 1100. Sadly you don’t get the opportunity to enter any of the traditional buildings and the grounds are rough making them inhospitable to collapsible strollers. Still worth the visit."
2383,5.0,Beautiful and impressive palace. The museum is within the grounds and free to enter. Definitely worth a visit. The palace itself is fantastic. Walking around seeing so many girls in Hannibal makes you feel truly immersed in history. :)
2384,5.0,This place is one the must ones you need to check out while your stay at Seoul it is all about koreans
2385,5.0,I was impressed by the beauty of the Palace and its huge territory. In spite of rainy weather tour to tha Palace was very interesting and informative.
2386,4.0,"Arrived at the palace at around 9:15am, got our tickets and grabbed a coffee at the Palace Museum before the Changing of the Guard at 10am. Would strongly recommend the Changing of the Guard - was easily the highlight of our visit. After that, we spent about 45 minutes walking around the palace grounds. Without a tour, it's pretty hard to understand the importance of each individual building - if you get the chance to take a tour then definitely do it. After 45 minutes, we were a little bored and ready to move on. It was entertaining watching everyone in their traditional costume take photos around the palace!"
2387,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung continued to serve as the main palace of the Joseon dynasty until the premises were destroyed by fire during the Imjin War (1592–1598) and abandoned for two centuries. However, in the 19th century, all of the palace's 7,700 rooms were later restored under the leadership of Prince Regent Heungseon during the reign of King Gojong. Some 500 buildings were restored on a site of over 40 hectares.The architectural principles of ancient Korea were incorporated into the tradition and appearance of the Joseon royal court.  In the early 20th century, much of the palace was systematically destroyed by Imperial Japan. Since then, the walled palace complex is gradually being restored to its original form. Today, the palace is arguably regarded as being the most beautiful and grandest of all five palaces. It also houses the National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum within the premises of the complex"
2388,5.0,Amazing! Went by fall when the colors are so vivid. Not that many other tourists also. Really recommended
2389,5.0,A friend of ours recommended this place and we were surprised the gardens were beautiful some of the trees were loosing their leaves and the old buildings were pretty and you got to get a sneak peek at one of the buildings getting a upgraded lots of space
2390,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is a must see, the most iconic sight in Seoul. The palace was build in 1395 and it was the largest of the five grand palaces in Seoul. The name Gyeongbok means “greatly blessed by heaven” The architecture , the trees and the mountain reflect spectacular views. Great place for photographers, history lovers, and art lovers. It is stunning in all seasons white in Winter, pink in Spring, orange in Autumn and green in Summer. Tours are available in English language, you can rent the “hanbok costume” and walk through the palace to take photos. The palace also has the National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum of Korea"
2391,5.0,"From what I recall, this place used to serve as the king's household back in the day. It was destroyed a few times, but it has been restored to its striking beauty.  The main palace and gate can be quite busy with tourists, but if you wander off into the surrounding gardens, you will feel as though you have been transported back in time. It's just you and no one else.  You can almost imagine what the palace would have been like back in the day, with the queen's ladies rushing back and forth, scholars being fully concentrated on their books, concubines hidden within the palace walls, and the king ordering his soldiers around.  I would highly recommend that if you are planning to go to only one palace during your time in Seoul, that you go to this one."
2392,4.0,"The architecture is mesmerizing. Even can relate to China and Japan's architectures, still it has its own identity"
2393,5.0,"Wounderful autumn view in the palace. Stunning view must visit place in Seoul. We take a lot of beautiful pictures wearing hanbok. However, the palace is super crowded so is advisable to visit in the morning."
2394,5.0,Went there as part of the group tour package we had on Nov 1-6 2018. I havent read anything about the place so i cherished the experience of just soaking it all in. We went first to the National museum and just a stone throw away is the entrance of this palace.  We just basically went directly to the Kings chamber and Queens quarter then that's just it. most of the rooms are close. would have been better if tourist can see what is inside those rooms  come a bit early if you don't want other tourist ruining your pictorials. mostly tourists arrived around 10am just like ours in time of the changing of guards ceremony..
2395,5.0,It is one of the important landmark to visit when you're in South Korea. Huge place with plenty of history. Worth a visit.
2396,5.0,"This place is a must visit. Really beautiful and serene, great atmosphere, excellent views, touch of history."
2397,5.0,The palace is very near our hotel. We rented a hanbok costume and stroll in the palace. Wearing their national costume is a welcoming experience its like time travelling on how its like to be a royalty.
2398,5.0,Just happened to be there on family culture day. Made it extra special. Anyone who wore traditional dress had there admission price waived. It was fun seeing all the Korean people dressed up. It seemed like they were having a blast. I would go back architecture was incredible.
2399,5.0,"This a beautiful place. Immediately, the beauty of nature well treated by centuries captures you. The trees, changing leaves in this so beautiful autumn in Seoul, the ancient architecture, the wonderful traditions — all makes up your day— a place to visit."
2400,5.0,We totally enjoyed our guided tour of the palace. Such an interesting historical landmark. Our guide was very informative and made sure we were looked after and safe.
2401,5.0,"When I first entered the palace, I thought, oh that's all of it. Ok but so-so. Then I went to the back of the palace, and found another palace, the I went deeper, found another, then another, then another. Took me 3 hours to reach the end of the palace and I belive I still did not visit everything. There were the main hall, king's palace, queen palace, prince palace, library, the harem palace, the queen's garden... It's beautiful. They also has many attractions such as traditional music and dances for the tourist."
2402,5.0,This palace is very atmospheric as you see locals dress in traditional clothing whilst sightseeing. Lots of interesting structures to see. Can get crowded but can still take good photos.
2403,4.0,You can’t get in to too many buildings but just walking around is stunning. The bright colours and the architecture - worth it.
2404,5.0,"The Palace complex was interesting, easy to take 1-2 hours and see everything. The architecture was very interesting and tours were available. Great venue for pictures. It was about 45 minutes from Downtown so Metro, Uber, or Cab."
2405,4.0,One of the five seoul palaces but the most important one. we attend first the guard change ceremony (very interesting) and then we went with the english guided visit offerd by seoul city by a very nice weather. The palace has a typical korean architecture and the garden are also so nice. A must during a stay in seoul
2406,4.0,A good visit to understand the erstwhile Korean royal traditions. Wearing the Hanbok is an option to consider
2407,4.0,"From the nearest metro to the palace is quite far. Just head straight to the statue and the palace gate is behind it. There is exhanging of the guards during specific times, so be sure to check it out before heading there to not miss it out."
2408,4.0,"A taste of Korean history. Don’t forget to check the timing changing of guards inside the Palace with their traditional military attire. Feel free to roam around the Palace like Joseun’s princesses, princes or even like a King! You can rent traditional outfits inside. A must for K-drama fans. Explore korean cuisins outside the Palace as well. Best time to travel in fall, winter or spring time! Korean history is cool and very interesting!"
2409,5.0,Been here for almost 4x in my Korea trip. But it always amaze me everytime I go here. It really gives us the ambience of a palace in the city. :)
2410,5.0,One of the best side that we found on our trip to Seoul. Must try the King's Tea set meal that they offer at Royal Kitchen.  the best time to visit are in summer since you can enjoy the beautiful landscape and pond the have in the castle. Would love to pay visit one more time in nearest time.
2411,5.0,"The culture of Joseon dynasty is almost similar with China Beijing palace too. The palace ground is not so huge but it is good for photography. Before visiting other palace, this is the main building for administrative during the Joseon era. Many of the buildings has been rebuilt and maintain as it was during that time. Now it is a musuem for everyone to enjoy."
2412,5.0,"while visiting gyeongbokgung, try wearing hanbok. You can find hanbok rental around the palace. if you using subway, go to gyeongbokgung station exit 5, you'll go straight to the palace. if you want to rental hanbok go to exit 3. You won't net to pay the entrance fee if you're using hanbok (which cost 3.000 won/person). it's noce experience wearing hanbok and strolling around this nice palace. a lot of instagrammable spot."
2413,5.0,"It is a huge palace with huge compunds. I assume the palace must be a very busy place with lots of activities going on, during those days. Another attraction is of cours the president’s official residence, which can be viewed from one of the gates in the palace."
2414,4.0,It was a good glimpse of their tradition and culture. The place is very clean and just the right spot for a tourist spot.
2415,4.0,It was last Wednesday of the month when we visited hence it was entrance is free. Did not realise this till we were there. Nice scenery and it felt as though we were not in the city~
2416,5.0,"This is a beautiful palace that is located near the Jae Sung de hwang statue. I enjoyed the autumn leaves color at this Palace, so beautiful!"
2417,5.0,"I went there with my family wearing the Hanbok, so we got the free admission. The place is wonderful, and not too crowded. Lots of chance to take good photograph."
2418,4.0,It was a great place to see how Korea's royalty used to live. The tour guide told us that there was no longer a royal family but the structures were still preserved and respected by Koreans.
2419,5.0,If you want to step into history that is well preserved and has people dressed from that era walking around. This is the place to visit because there are actual guards standing outside and guard changes during certain times. The building and everything has been well-preserved and it is just a beautiful site to take in. There are tour groups that you can join for explanations.
2420,5.0,"The Palace surprised me: it is huge and very interesting, I had a guided tour with my workgroup and all of us were fascinated."
2421,5.0,Lovingly place to visit during autumn when the weather is nice and cooling. A lot of space with mountains as a backdrop.  A lot of Korean history has Chinese influence. Draw your own comparison if you been to china and korea :)
2422,4.0,"I would recommend going early. By 11am the place was very crowded. There are 3 free English speaking tours and we attended the 1.30 tour. It was very informative. The buildings are interesting and we learnt a lot of its history. However the highlight was the peaceful garden, by the water and with the mountains in the background. We sat here for at least an hour after the tour, away from the bustle of seoul outside the walls."
2423,5.0,this is a majestic palace. we got a glimpse of korean culture of the past. it was cold when we went there so it was a chilly tour but we enjoyed it
2424,4.0,"Really pretty in autumn, with lots of golden leaves everywhere. Stunning buildings and tranquil pools."
2425,5.0,well I still prefer JAPAN and Beijing .... Korean palace is not that really interesting like in Japan or beijing ....
2426,4.0,"I thought the most amazing thing about the palace was the surroundings. You looking at these hundreds of years old buildings, no running water, hot water electricity, turn your head and see skyscrapers. The juxtaposition of the new and old is one of the best things about South Korea, the past isnt just there, its embraced and celebrated and the palace is one of the best examples of that. Plan half the day, the buildings really do look similar and its easy to get turned around, i recommend using the information map and having a pen to mark off the buildings listed to make sure you really saw everything. The best part was that it wasn't a look and dont touch experience, there is a library on the grounds that you can enter, they give you slippers, and look at the books."
2427,4.0,"In my opinion, you can skip the Changdeokgung Palace but not this one. Try on a Hanbok and be one with the crowd in awe of the wonderful scenery --not to mention, the instagram-worthy spots too!"
2428,5.0,"Highly recommended to rent a hanbok to tour this grand Palace. Many photogenic spots available for you to shoot. Don't worry, there'll be many others who is wearing hanbok too over there. Free entrance for those who are wearing hanbok."
2429,4.0,"Very close from Subway station in line 3 (gyeongbokgung station), this is a must see if you are a few days in town. Not expensive ( 3000 krw), no big wait line. I was lucky to arrive at 10 am on a Saturday when a show with dressed up Korean warriors played a ceremonial entrance at the sound of trumpets and gong. In addition, not as crowded as historical sites in Beijing. Thumb up therefore."
2430,5.0,"This is my second time coming to the palace. I spent more time in the palace this time round and even wore a hanbok. Most parts of the palace looks the same but if you are short of time, just see the main entrance area and the big front part of the palace and finish of by visiting the garden. y.  I didnt spend alot of time this palace when I came the first trip because I had other sites to explore. Good for picturesque shots and instagram worth. Try to come early if you want less people."
2431,4.0,The Palace is at The Center OF The City. IT has three gates and at 10am there is The changing OF The guards. The events takes about 15 to 20 minutes. The Palace grounds is huge and The Center is The throne Building. You can see Thru The Front door to see The throne but you can not get inside. Then you can see The living quarters OF The royale at The back. Be ready for The crowd but a worthwhile activity.
2432,5.0,This palace is pretty and very big to explore. You can take a half day for taking so much beautiful picture especially on the part where you enter the palace and go to the left where there is a park there is a palace in a middle of little lake. Very recommended to go there.
2433,4.0,"This is one of the main attractions of any visit to Seoul. We walked right around the exterior walls in the early morning before it opened for a bit of exercise. The buildings on the inside are large but nor elaborate - grand but understated. The thing that interested me most was how they heated these large buildings in winter by having fires burning in alcoves in strategic places in the stone foundations to provide underfloor heating. Without that, they would have been freezing in winter."
2434,4.0,Its a good place to visit if you are one interested in the cultural experience exploring new places. Try renting a Hanbok while walking around the place. It was a bit crowded when we were there (peak season) and dont miss the Changing of the guards ceremony (check the times when you visit)
2435,4.0,it's really fun to experiece with hanbok at this palace. i just a little crowded during the month i visited. maybe it's autumn now! overall great and enjoyed at here. love it.
2436,5.0,"When I visited the palace was closed to the public, it is closed on Tuesday, but nevertheless I was not disappointed, it easy to get to the palace by subway, you to get to Seoul station, read the map, buy the ticket and get to the palace station, from there it is about a 3-5 minutes walk to the palace, there is a museum with a couple shops and café nearby, it was raining when I visited so my exploration was limited, however I would recommend the palace visit, entry to the museum was free of charge and the subway is inexpensive, on average it costs about 5000 south Korean won per trip one way and the journey may take about 1 hour from Seoul station."
2437,5.0,Had a lot to take in and a short time to do it. didn't get to see it all. but the architecture and vibrant colors of the buildings and the fall foliage was wonderful. for 3000 KRW it was well worth the visit.
2438,4.0,"Quite busy with Hanok wearing tourists but the palace is great to walk around and take it in , especially when it's a sunny day"
2439,4.0,"Historical places, nice to take picture as a tourist ( landmark) Also you get to try hanbok( korea traditional cloth)"
2440,5.0,The museum is a good introduction to Korean history and society. Unfortunately was a rainy day and walking outside was limited.
2441,4.0,Went specifically for the night lights. There was a special music performance at night but didn’t manage to stay for it. Go if you want to take amazing photos
2442,5.0,This is a beautiful place to wander around and imagine what it was like in the past. The changing of the guards was an interesting ceremony.
2443,4.0,It's worth seeing this palace and get to know some historical facts.  Huge Palace and you need to buy ticket to enter the main Palace.
2444,3.0,"One of the major palaces in Seoul city center. All tourists tours will definitely make a stop here. The place is nice but its just too pack with people. Opt for the other palace, although smaller but you get to enjoy it"
2445,5.0,"I was fortunate on my visit here to see a lot of students dressed in traditional Korean costumes which made the atmosphere more enchanting, even though it was drizzling during my visit. Close the the Folk Museum also which was great!"
2446,4.0,"Visited this palace during the fall season, and you will see the surroundings with yellowish or redish trees.  I only visited 2 palaces in total, but seems this is one of the biggest? Not too sure. It seems that the palace internal design and its layout looks pretty much similar. If you are one who watched quite a few of those Korea’s ancient drama, you will feel that those drama scene came alive in front of you.  There’s a national museum (just right when you came out of the station) which is free admission. Personally, I find it really interesting as you get to know the rich history of Korea in the past.  Further ahead (right besides the museum), there’s a park (at least that’s what I think it is) where you will see a big massive big yellowish tree. Many people who rented the traditional hanbok costume will be taking pictures at there. It was really some nice scene and relaxing."
2447,5.0,"This is the only palace we visited during this trip, we did make an online reservation 3 days ago in order for us to join their palace tour. Same entrance fee for visitor with or without the guide, we have chosen the morning session and very lucky that the weather is so good and we managed to get some nice photos. My own opinion, if you would like to take more photos then try not to follow the guide, we drop the group half way so that our time is more flexible and no need to rush, remember the palace is very big, it is not easy to finish the tour and then walk all the way back to the place that you want to take photos."
2448,5.0,"It was my second time visiting this palace and it was still a wonder to the eyes. It is very large and touring around it will take more than an hour. This is one of the more famous filming sites in Korea. If you are lucky, there are also ceremonies which you will get to see live for free. Entrance fee is 3000 won and it is worth it (at least for me); clean and very well maintained. If you’re into architectures and culture, this place is highly recommended."
2449,5.0,"The palace is really characteristic and I recommend its visit. Remember, that you need to purchase a ticket to enter the area."
2450,5.0,"One of the most iconic sites in seoul. You need to buy a ticket to visit the rest of the palace’s compound. There are more residences, hall and pavilion inside the compound. You can also see the changing of the guard ceremony at the gates. Its free."
2451,5.0,Nice Palace for taking photos with family and friends. Alot of greens and lakes lakes around the area. Recommend to come early as it gets packed quickly with tours.
2452,4.0,Venture in this place if you want to see historical architectures. Many locals and tourists visit here too.
2453,3.0,You can see a bunch of palaces and interesting places. The major gripe I had was the amount of information in English was limited. I would love to see more in depth historical descriptions and other things to make looking at the architecture worth it.  Worth the trip if you are in the area but not terribly exciting
2454,5.0,We enjoyed our visit to the Palace and especially the surrounding park and open area. The weather was sunny and pleasant so there were many people wearing traditional Korean costumes which created a special atmosphere and beauty. Costumes can be rented a shops around the park. Definitely worth a visit and even donning a traditional costume!
2455,5.0,Great 1/2 day trip staring with watching changing of the Guards. Wonderful grounds and beautiful buildings. Top it off with a visit to the Korean Folk Lore Museum.
2456,5.0,"If you travel to Seoul, a visit to this palace is a must! While we did not hire any handbock (found it a bit of a tourist trap), we did enjoy the walk around the palace and very much loved watching people dressed up with the traditional Korean clothes, and took many pics of people taking pics. I can recommend a visit but be aware that you will find many many people there."
2457,5.0,"There are a lot of palaces in the Seoul, but this is the best of the lot. Very nice and well maintained....but NO visitors ..."
2458,4.0,"Consider purchasing the royal palace pass that includes 4 palaces and the royal shrine for 10,000 (approx $8.80USD).  Destroyed by a fire in 1592, it remained in ruins for over 270 years. In 1867 it was restored...during the Japanese occupation a lot of damage occurred. In 1915 over 90% of the buildings were destroyed. In 1990 a new renovation project began.  If you purchased the 4 palace package of tickets it is worth to see."
2459,4.0,Was business trip with a little pleasure mixed in. Found the palace of great interest. Place is clean and in the center of the old part of town.  Easy parking. Traffic to get there is bad. But traffic in The city is bad everywhere.
2460,4.0,Went there in the morning and with the perfect weather it was a great stroll. Saw a lot of people wearing the traditional korean outfit. It has good history and make sure you grab a map as you go it for guidance.
2461,5.0,"This is the most popular palace in Seoul, for both locals and foreigners. If you only have a few hours in Seoul between business meetings, I recommend starting from here, take a stroll down towards the City Hall. Gyeongbok Palace's pond is one of must-see views of Seoul."
2462,5.0,"I came here on Sunday not really sure what to expect having read that it is a very popular place. Certainly the queues at the ticket counters weren't as long as the day before, but nevertheless I was rather apprehensive about getting caught up in the crowds. As it was I didn't need to worry. There were a lot of people around but the grounds are really impressively big and I never felt being in an overcrowded situation. Indeed, the deeper you walk north towards the Bukaksan mountain, the thinner the crowds become. I found myself walking though some Palace buildings completely on my own.  I wasn't worried by the paucity of information in the English language. I navigated around with a small pamphlet available near the entrance and dipped into the internet whenever I needed special information like details about the alleged gruesome assassination of Queen Myeongseong by Japanese assassins.  Indeed it's worth noticing that this ""Brilliance and Fortune"" Palace (Gyeon Bok) of the Joseon dynasty was destroyed by fire and Japanese invaders going back many centuries (and even as recently as the 1940s during the last WW2). And most, if not all of the buildings were restored since the 1990!s  I visited on a lovely warm, sunny October day which was ideal. I was really impressed to see so many people dressed in traditional ""Hanbok"" costumes from the Joseon period. There were even the odd (really odd) groups of lads dressed up in the costumes usually reserved for ladies... Apparently anyone so dressed gets preferential and free access to the palaces, so now you know."
2463,3.0,"A short trip, this place needs a guide. Many tour groups create challenges for access The historical significance is important but lost as few English signs or information boards. An English map is available free near front gate office"
2464,5.0,Beautifully maintained buildings and gardens. A real onsite in to the history of Korea. So many people dress in traditional clothing to visit the palace. You can enjoy a tea ceremony of learn to make rice cakes. Allow several hours for your visit but dont miss it
2465,5.0,"My mother wanted to go to Asia and this is what she expected to see. It is a turn ""East Asian"" experience. A must see in Seoul."
2466,4.0,I had fun visiting this place and reading about its history. Some people dressed up in the national attire which made me feel like I travelled back in time.
2467,4.0,"We went there in summer, it was so hot and crowded at the same time. We enjoyed visiting historical palace in Seoul eventhough only for a while because there were many good spots to take photo and the sunlight really supported us :)"
2468,5.0,"Great Palace,, the architecture, the building and also perfect weather in October. One of the place you have to visit in Seoul."
2469,5.0,Arrived just in time to watch the changing of the guard. Neat to see and get to take pictures with them. The palace grounds is quite large and lots to see. Do recommend!
2470,5.0,"Easy to visit, not expensive (I paid my entrance 3000 Wons), it is beautifully restored and shows that grandeur of the Joseon . You can visit the palace, the pavilions, lots of beautiful gardens. This palace used to be the home of Kings of the Joseon dynasty, the Kings' households, as well as the government of Joseon. Not to be missed!"
2471,5.0,"Chinese style palace, but still very beautiful. You can enjoy the palace with Korean traditional clothes which could be rented out side the palace. Very beautiful inside. Must see spot!  中國式的宮殿，但仍然非常壯麗。 你可以在景福宮外頭租韓國傳統的服飾一遊景福宮。 宮殿內頭非常漂亮。 非常推薦的景點。"
2472,5.0,"At first I wasn’t aware that my time of visit to seoul coincide with one of the biggest Annual Korean Holiday which is Chuseok or Korean thanksgiving. Me and my family decided to visit Gyeongbokgung during the first day of chuseok (we had prior research on which place will open during that time and Gyeongbokgung Palace happen to open during that day). Keep in mind, turns out the entrance fee during chuseok is free for public during chuseok days ! The palace was really crowded with people and best time to visit is during lunchtime. Although it will get real hot since the sun is just right above us ! But all in all we had a great time there, even my sister and mom decided to rent a hanbok (Korean traditional dresses) to get into the spirit of festivity."
2473,4.0,"Was there for the free English tour. It was nice, i can understand that it won’t be too informative as it’s free tour after all. But the tour guide gave us some understanding of Korean king culture. A lot of people wearing hanbok to get in for free. Missed the change of guards because of the free tour. we would thought that they will arrange the tour timing so that tour started off with the change of guards. To have that nice flow"
2474,5.0,A highlight of a trip to Seoul. So beautiful to see locals wearing the traditional hanbuk outfits. The downside? The multitude of selfies taken by tourists!!! Doesn't anyone enjoy sightseeing anymore?!
2475,5.0,This beautifully restored and maintained property is lovely to see. It's very scenic with many folks wandering the grounds in traditional costumes. I would have loved to spend more time here!
2476,5.0,You should visit all the palace. all are special in there own way. Gyeongbokgung is ofcourse the bigest and the one you shoud do for sure when you are in Korea
2477,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung - main palace in seoul. A must do on your Seoul tour list. A hugh palace area with wide green areas, a lot of temples and wonderful atmosphere. 3 bucks (2018) for Entrance is absolutely worth. ITip: f u want to top it costum in traditional hanbok clothes and feel like princess and prince charming with your beloved as many other couples do. Hanbok rental in nearby streets. (10.000W per 2hour). If u prefer more calm time for your visit avoid weekends. See u there"
2478,5.0,This is one of the biggest palace i every been in Seoul. You can hire Hanbok nearby and take pictures about the whole palace. There are alot of different performance nearby such as Folk museum and others within the palace. There are alot to see inside the palace and alot of photo area to pose with your hanbok!
2479,3.0,I dont like this place. It's better to go to Kyoto (Japan ) or Hue ( Vietnam ). I think I wont come back.
2480,5.0,This is a must see. The architecture is beautiful and it’s an oasis in the city. Take some time and walk the grounds as well.
2481,4.0,"We visited this place with two children. It is beautiful place and lots to see Highly recommend. Give enough time . Lots of walking . We took English speaking guide, Bit disappointed as she spoke very fast and did not allow group together to catch up. Go early as not to miss changing of guard and visit to Gardens.   ."
2482,4.0,Quite a number of structures displaying typical housing of past royalty.  Well maintained and easy to get around.  Large place and makes you think about what life was like in the past.  Ceremonial changing of the guards was pretty neat to see as well. .
2483,4.0,"Arrived just in time for the changing of the guards! We took a cab to the palace, so I’m not too sure about parking."
2484,5.0,"With the entrance fee of 3000KRW for an adult, it is worthed to see the beauty of Palace and park with the background of the mountain. Besides that, you can see people wearing the traditional Hanbok walking around the palace. There is a museum where you can visit and have a look the antique things and the history of the Palace."
2485,4.0,I bring my daughter use wheelchair. She is very exciting to see king's palace..but unfortunately she's can't explore because the location is not very friendly for wheelchair. Hopefully someday uf we can back to Seoul again the goverment make some revolution for wheelchair can more convenient.
2486,4.0,Good start to touring Seoul & Korea. Limited English signage. Great place to see people wear hanboks. (Free admission to palaces if wearing.)
2487,4.0,"We spent a couple of hours walking around a looking at all the buildings and then went to a museum at the end, which is included in the admission fee. You are able to rent traditional costumes for photo taking. We didn’t do this, but we did see a lot of people wearing the transitional clothes."
2488,5.0,That’s what someone we met there said. It’s like Buckingham palace Korean style in that they have their fancy guards too at the gate. The grounds are beautiful and can’t believe how many buildings they have rebuilt. Very traditional architecture. Very central to walk to other interesting places. The president’s home and various embassies are directly behind the temple. You can’t go in the gated compound of the president and embassies but it is interesting never-the-less. The Museum of Korean Folk History is right beside the compound. Also worth seeing.
2489,5.0,"I visited the Palace grounds twice as the first time I did not get a chance to see it all. The second time with a friend, we rented traditional Korean outfits and explored. Was such a neat experience and excellent for photographs. The palace and the grounds are beautifully kept and so much history."
2490,5.0,I was impressed by how much history this site holds. Even though most of the buildings are not original it's still a great stop in Seoul. Be sure to be present for the changing of the guards that was my favorite part of this visit!
2491,5.0,"Take a tour of the palace, they will make sure you're in the right spot to get great pictures and see all the entertainment."
2492,3.0,Quite ok if you’re not rushing for time to shop and prefer sightseeing. It gets more interesting after you are half-way done where you get to see smaller designated rooms/areas meant for various functions.
2493,5.0,"This is a fantastic palace to visit in Seoul as it's very large and there's so much to see. There are many picturesque views to photograph and if you bought the combination ticket for the palace and royal shrine, you'll be able to read a little of its history in the booklet."
2494,5.0,Gyeongbokgung is a must visit attractions in Seoul. Easy access from every corner of Seoul. This vast palace complex is well preserved and well maintained. It took more than 3hours to tour this complex. You can learn the magnificent Koryo Kingdom from this palace.
2495,5.0,A nice stroll in any time of the day is great in this palace. So much to venture and see. You'll meet friendly locals here just watch out for the tourist ;)
2496,5.0,"Hands down this is the best historic site to see in Seoul. Although it is not the original structures from hundreds of years ago, as the Japanese have repeatedly burned the down over the years, it is still very nice and provides a view into the Korea of yesteryear. If you are in Seoul and enjoy architecture or history this should be at the top of your list."
2497,4.0,This is a massive beautiful palace. I would highly recommend a guided tour as there are not many signs explaining what everything is.
2498,4.0,"Stick with your tour guide cos I got lost! Luckily they were able to bring the bus round to get me but still... it’s a beautiful place with lots of history and culture. We arrived in time to see the guard changing ceremony which was great, and there’s a lot to see. A must see if you visit Korea!"
2499,4.0,"A must visit for first time visitors. Gyeongbokgung Palace is grandest of all the other palaces in Seoul. Built in the heart of Seoul with a beautiful lake, surrounded by mountains. Guard changing ceremony (guards dressed in Korean traditional costumes) was a real pleasure to watch and gives you an opportunity to experience Korean tradition. Great place to capture gorgeous pictures of the scenery and architecture. Free guided tours in English are available at 11:00, 13:00, and 15:30.  Quick Tip: 1. Integrated Ticket of Palaces can help you save money if you wish to visit multiple palaces in Seoul.  2. Wearing traditional Korean dress “Hanbok” will grant you free entry into the palace"
2500,5.0,"visiting the final night opening in this year 2018. lots of people are there. so fantastic and beatiful palace. Keep remins that when you want to visit here, should buy ticket in advance through Internet. 정말 멋지고 꼭 한번은 봐야할곳. 올해의 야간개장은 끝났고 내년을 기약하며.. 일반개장도 야간못지않게 또 다른 느낌이니 꼭 한번 아니 두번 가보시길. 입장권 예매는 필수."
2501,5.0,A must see attraction in Seoul. Got in free because it was a national holiday. Beautiful buildings. Lots of photo opportunities.
2502,5.0,Easily accessible by subway. You can almost imagine how they lived back in the days. It is a good thing that they are preserving the palace.
2503,1.0,"Nothing special. Not real good things, just buildings from the XX century but old style. If possible, go somewhere else..."
2504,5.0,"Amazing palace in centre of seoul. Got some great shots, especially of moutains one side, modern skyscrapers the other. Lots of english friendly exhibits and helpful staff. Plenty to see for an afternoon/ half day. A real must see for any first time visitor to Seoul."
2505,4.0,Get there early and watch the changing of the guard at 10:00. Wander around for a while and see the old buildings.
2506,4.0,"If you want to experience history in modern Seoul, you have to go here. Korean history comes alive while you wander the extensive grounds. My tip is to come here during the Chuseok Holidays"
2507,5.0,"Lovely Palace with a colourful Royal Guarding Changing Ceremony every day at 10:00 and 14:00, except tuesdays . Don´t miss it. In the middle of a hightech city, an ancestral ceremony."
2508,5.0,"This is a ""MUST-SEE"" if you ever come to Seoul! I am a huge fan of architecture, and you will find exquisite designs here. The grounds are vast, and you could walk around for hours, which is what I did and loved every meter of it! The history here and what was told to me by my girlfriend was simply incredible! Oddly enough, she had never been and yet lives in Seoul, lol. You must dedicate at least a couple of hours to explore this wonderous place and even go into the museum if you find yourself with some extra time. Also, the gardens are just fantastic!"
2509,5.0,"I booked a tour including a stop here through Viator. It was great to get to know about the history of the place and also see the changing of the guards at 10 am. It’s a huge area with many buildings. In many ways similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing. Note that there is free access on the last Wednesday of every month. But also expect lots of tourists all the other days. It’s located close to the other palace, in walkable distance but don’t plan both on the same day as I recommend you the guided tour of the Secret Garden which starts at 10.30 am. It is possible to book another time online, though, but I found it fine to take one palace at a time."
2510,5.0,"To learn about South Korean history, there is nothing better than this amazing palace. We didn't book a tour but we did it ourselves. Before the visit, we had to document ourselves to learn about this amazing country Every step took us to the hidden gems of this palace. We had a great time. There is a small admission fee. But if you rent the costume, you don't have to pay anything. The costume itself speaks volumes about the Korean traditions, customs and way of life. It's worth the visit."
2511,5.0,Spent time here on my first day and it was worth seeing. Very big and in the centre of places to see for tourists.
2512,5.0,Excellent place to visit when in Seoul. If you speak English they offer free tours in English 2 or 3 times a day. Check times before going. You do have to admission fee unless you are 65 or older. Tour last about 1 hour. You can spend some additional time on your own.
2513,5.0,"Nice place to educate foreigners of a part of the history of korea. We were with a guided tour and it was pretty awesome to know a lot about the story of the palace, and the royalty."
2514,4.0,"This is good place to learn about the Korean culture and history. It is in the heart of Seoul and is an expansive place to walk around so wear good walking shoes. The buildings are preserved well, and the grounds are well-maintained. It is nice to see some of the people dressed up in the traditional costume so you feel like you were there in the old days."
2515,4.0,"One of palace you should visit when you came to seoul. i visited the palace wearing their traditional Korean costume,they called it ""Hanbok"". their place very nice especialy on spring season. their entrance fee is free if you go inside the palace wearing hanbok."
2516,5.0,"Türkçe: Burayı mutlaka gezmelisiniz. Buranın en önemli saray yerleşkesi.  You should definitely see this place. If you visit here in september, they have thanksgiving holiday. It is free and you can see people with traditional clothes"
2517,5.0,Good educational things kids can learn and some kinds of activities they can experience. Yuo could have some life time good pictures.
2518,5.0,The beauty of this palace is beyond question. We visited the palace with the traditional Korean costume. At the beginning I was very skeptical about this idea but it turned out to be a unique experience. Then I figured out there were about 5% visitors dressing the same so we didn't look strange at all. It is definitely memorable to walk in the ancient palace with this costume!
2519,5.0,Korea’s main palace. Walk The whole vicinity for half a day. Worth it to have a feel of the Korean imperial culture
2520,5.0,I think that it’s a best free thing about Seoul! You will enjoy Korean culture and spirit of the old city. Buildings are so beautiful and mountains near it looks great
2521,4.0,"Located in the centre of the city, this is easy to walk to from most hotels with the added benefit of escaping modern life as soon as you walk in to the outer courtyard.  The buildings are stunning, changing of the guard ceremony is something to watch and a must for photographers and tourists alike."
2522,5.0,I loved visiting this palace. They have free guided tours and you can make reservations at the website.
2523,5.0,"While visiting Seoul in September 2018, My husband & I took one hour free English tour provided by the palace. I believe they provide two English tours per day. The tour schedule was posted in the ticket office. We enjoyed the tour very much & learned about not only a part of Korean history but also current cultural historical connections. I am glad we took the tour. We also watched a change of guard ceremony which I wasn’t too impressed with. Overall it was a nice 1/2 day tour at the palace."
2524,4.0,"This is my second visit and learned more each time I visit, The gardens at the back were closed off this time due to some renovations,but still a lot of area to cover that is still open to public,"
2525,3.0,"Don’t visit it in summer because really hot, it’s open palace but u can’t go in just see it from outside, entrance fee cost 3$ , their are 2 show changing guard 1 out palace 2 in palace"
2526,5.0,Interesting location to visit and take photos. I recommend to rent their costumes and take photos there
2527,4.0,This was a great experience! The palace grounds are large. Easy to get around and English guide and tours available!
2528,5.0,"This is the first and grandest of the palaces in Seoul. You may rent a hanbok just outside the palace. If you wear a hanbok, the entrance fee is waived. It was very nice taking our pictures wearing the hanbok in the different very picturesque buildings, hallways, and walls. They have a changing of the guard ceremony in the morning. Unfortunately, we were not able to watch it. This is the palace you must visit when you are in Seoul. It was really fun posing like K-drama actors."
2529,5.0,The palace is beautiful so well kept and the weather for me was also perfect. there was so much to see and do and the entrance fee was so cheap too! it was just at the change of autumn and the colours were amazing no tree or plant was the same shade! the changing of the guard is fabulous to watch so many people gathered to see it
2530,5.0,"The price was around 1-2usd. The amount of places to see and hang around is pretty big and very beautiful views! Comparing to nearby palaces this one is the best value for money. If you want to watch the guard's changing ceremony it's actually outside of the paying zone. There are toilets and cafeteria, nearby is a free of charge museum."
2531,5.0,"Although the current palace is not the original one, we still enjoy the ancient atmosphere, the magnificent structure. Highly recommend to make a visit in the autumn, when all the ginkgo trees turn to magic yellow and all the palace sinks in a very romantic atmosphere. You also can hire a Hanbok, dress up, walk in the palace and let your imagination go through back the ancient time!"
2532,5.0,Beautiful palace grounds - views are spectacular with the mountains forming the backdrop to the palace. Lots of photo opportunity places as long as you are able to find a time when there will be less crowds.
2533,5.0,"The Palace was magnificent and the area is quite huge. We rented a Hanbok ( traditional korean attire ) We wore it roaming around and it feels like going back through time. it will also save you from paying for palace entrance and going thru long queing lines going inside. We were also lucky to witness the changing of the palace guards. There was a traditional ceremony, guards were wearing korean warrior outfits. We were also amaze with the structures of the palace and easily appreciated the korean culture. Must see at seoul."
2534,4.0,We went here before the Changing of the Guards ceremony and there were a lot of people already. Better to visit wearing a hanbok to truly feel the ambiance of the place and of course for pictorial sessions. :) I would love to visit again!
2535,4.0,"While interesting to explore, not much areas to take cover for a quick respite from the searing heat of summer. Changing of guard ceremony is a sight to watch, but times and length of ceremony depends on the weather. Ticket is good for one entry only. If you come out to watch the changing of guard ceremony from exploring the palace, you will not be allowed to get in again unless you buy a new ticket, so be careful. Massive structures of palaces and other buildings, all replicas. Still, an experience not to miss when in Seoul."
2536,4.0,My first Palace in Seoul and of course a must see. The guards are a bit over the top but the Palace is great to wander around. It has a filmic atmosphere with the mountain background. Consider going in on the north side and walk down to the main entrance.
2537,4.0,"Nice place, pool and park inside. Near the mountain. Fresh air and for relax..  Easily accessed by metro."
2538,5.0,"i habe several times visit and each time have recognized different point. do not expect alot, so simple and quite, no luxry but let you to feel strenght"
2539,5.0,"This palace just goes on and on. Many people arrive in traditional dress which really adds to the experience even if you don’t dress up yourself. The palace is similar to other East Asian ones if you have visited China for example. Opportunity to indulge in a royal afternoon tea, or visit the folk museum (fee). Alternatively go into the Royal Palaces Museum right next door. Great way to spend a morning."
2540,5.0,"If you have a choice, do not visit in the summer... it is way to hot. In any case we enjoyed as much as possible and there was a nice museum at the end of the palace which was interesting."
2541,5.0,"Built in 1395, the Gyeongbokgung Palace is arguably the most cherished of South Korea’s many heritage sites. It is similar to Beijing’s Forbidden City, but at a slightly smaller scale. However, do not let this scale comparison confuse you, this palace and its grounds are quite expansive and should rightfully take at least half a day to visit properly. The complex has been extensively and lovingly restored following destruction by and expulsion of the Japanese during WWII. It is currently a museum (Korea’s imperial family is long gone), the grounds of which also contain the National Folk Museum. This is a must-see while visiting the South Korean capital."
2542,5.0,"This was such an amazing trip, anyone who is going to seoul must visit the palace and village, it takes a few hours to walk around the palaces but so worth the walk, make sure to find the information guide and get a map off them because you'll definately need it."
2543,5.0,"I'd highly recommend starting your stay in Seoul at Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's very picturesque and takes you back to another time. Also, it was very interesting seeing the Blue house nearby with all the security guards at the end of my exploration of Gyeongbokgung! Also, it's near Bukchon Hanok Village, which shows a bunch of traditional Korea houses. Prime location to start your exploration!"
2544,5.0,"one of the beautiful palaces. Huge and probably will take most of your day. The tickets are cheap and if you wear korean dress, then its free entry. Change of guards is good but not as good as Buckingham palace, London"
2545,5.0,I personally love the garden of the palace. It's a huge palace located at the centre of the city. Even though there were many tourists but it doesn't feel crowded due to huge size of the place.
2546,4.0,"Went for a short visit as it was way too cold.. Was - 13 that day. Didn't not manage to go for the free guide tour as well but we managed to catch the changing guards ceremony, it was magnificent. Overall quite a nice place to visit."
2547,5.0,First it is a perfect mix between the modern city and the culture and traditional buildings. Is some of the most interesting points from Seoul
2548,4.0,"We enjoyed touring this palace, though it should be noted that most of it has been rebuilt in the last decade or so. The experience was enhanced by the tourists dressing up in local costume and floating about."
2549,5.0,"Even on a hot day, you'd still want to visit the place to see the sights, the intricate designs, the culture and it's great for picture taking. There were a lot of people but the place is big enough to go around. You'd definitely should put this on your itinerary."
2550,5.0,"It was a very hot day when we visited, but it's so worth it. My kids rented the traditional Korean costumes (Hanbok) before entering the palace. It's free admission if you are wearing Hanbok. The place is huge, we visited a few of the main buildings, very beautiful paintings/decor. Lots of places to take good photos. You can get there by subway with a short walk, it's definitely worth a visit!"
2551,5.0,"i went there during winter, the lake was frozen, there was snow everywhere on the land because last night of my visit day was snowing so it was so beautiful. there, you can take a lot of pictures, it is the largest palace, just a very historical place, i would recommend other to go to this palace first, and then go to the gwanhwamun, take a picture of king sejong, walk down to cheonggyecheon stream (make sure, you check the festival event, there may be a lantern festival at night ). it is a lot of walking and please wear sneakers. then take a lunch and go to the bukchon hanok village."
2552,5.0,"Beautiful complex, georgeous painting, very reaonably priced but go before you have spent a lot of time walking already-the complex is huge and you can walk for 2 or 3 hours"
2553,5.0,"The place is magnificent, building impressive with color and artistic details. People were wearing traditional beautiful Korean costumes. Changing of the guard was an attraction. This place transported me in ancient times. Thank you!"
2554,5.0,Wonderful to come and visit for a couple of hours. Definitely not to be missed if on a trip to Seoul.
2555,5.0,Must see place in Seoul. Lots of history. Good for taking pictures. Add it easily to your itinerary when in the area. A bit too hot in August though as little shade.
2556,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace located in the buzzling area of Seoul. However it keeps the tradition such as changing guard activity. The admissions is 3000 Won, but it is free for those who wear hanbok, the Korean traditional costume. So I chose the experience of wearing hanbok, pretending to be a Korean Princess while going around the palace. It was quite enjoyable although for only 2 hours, as we went there in summer and it was really hot inside hanbok :)"
2557,5.0,Excellent destination for tourists to experience South Korean culture and history. Visited during the summer weather and it made for a spectacular day out exploring the palace and learning about South Korean history. Lots to see and experience including cultural performances
2558,4.0,"Cannot say that I was absolutely astonished by the palace, but it is a tourist must visit in Seoul.  To make experience more fun, make sure you rent traditional Korean costumes and wear them around. There are plenty of places nearby + you get free entry to the palace!"
2559,5.0,It was such a pretty place.. could spend a few hours walking in the palace grounds. However it would be more helpful if there were more information written in English as language can be an issue sometimes though people are very polite it's difficult to get your point across.
2560,5.0,"Due to time restraints I was only able to stop by for one of the guard-changing ceremonies, but wow! Highly recommended; it's a wonderful opportunity to take-in part of Seoul's rich history, and if you're able to actually go in and see the palace it will undoubtedly be worth it. A must-see on any trip to Seoul."
2561,5.0,This was a lot of fun. beautiful place to visit. Inexpensive and friendly staff. It was the chinese new year when I went so everyone wore their formal attire whenever they were out.
2562,5.0,Interesting area just in the centre. For tourist free entrance with the national costume. You can rent your costumes nearby the palace.
2563,5.0,"It is inspiring to walk across the wide squares in front of the king's palace, or to take refuse from the intense summer heat in one of the minor houses, where doors leading to secret paths remain close and silent to the occasional visitor."
2564,5.0,"very huge palace depend on your pace, need 1-2 hours to visit, and , enjoyed guard changing parade. we clicked snaps with palace guards, it was very nice experience. my children enjoyed a lot."
2565,4.0,This is my 4th visit to Seoul. Gyeongbokgong still a Must go place for 1st timer. Brought my friend there n she loves it at 1st sight.
2566,4.0,It is a must on your itinerary. You can easily spend half a day here. A large complex. The changing of guards ceremony is highlight and is a must see. (check the timings before visiting).
2567,5.0,"The day we went there was light rain. We still enjoyed walking around and taking pictures. We arrived early so it was not crowded. As we were leaving the crowds were arriving. I would add this to you list of ""must see"" items in Seoul."
2568,5.0,This is a very old palace which was first built more than 600 hundred years ago. It was a residence for the Korean kings previously.  It was destroyed and rebuilt again many times over the years. The builidngs are empty inside because most of the original furnitures and items were destryoed already.  The palace has got very colorful exteriors. There are many courtyards inside. Big space and yards. Lots of tree.  Very pleasant to walk around and take some nice photos.
2569,5.0,its beautiful i recommend taking a tour as some of the signs are not in english so it is hard for non korean speakers to know the history of certain builsdinbgs
2570,3.0,"Palace is very vast and grand. but wrong timing for us as the weather was extremely hot. The changing of guard, while colourful, is not very pompous. should include more soldiers and perhaps horses, etc."
2571,5.0,Please check the Opening dates before your visit. I have noticed that some Palace are closed on Mondays while other are closed on Tuesdays. Please check! I did it with the Red Bus Tour!
2572,4.0,"Enter these walls and you'll find yourself lost in a labyrinth of pathways and structures. And although the expansive grounds seem to extend infinitely toward the mountains as you press deeper and deeper, what remains today is most but not all of the once massive palace grounds that existed in the 15th century (as illustrated by a mural in the palace museum).  Built in 1395, this was the Joseon dynasty's most extensive endeavor, an enormous facility on 107 acres with 7,700 rooms (99 acres remain now). This is a stunning relic of the past, a maze of buildings, every turn providing new adventures. I highly recommend this site if you're visiting Seoul."
2573,5.0,This palace is the greatest palace of all palaces in Seoul in my opinion. Both in size as in attractiveness. Beautiful buildings and landscape. If you want to visit only one palace this is the one.
2574,4.0,I recommend you visiting this with a hanbok rental. Most people go here for photos and this place never disappoints.
2575,4.0,"The area of the palace very large. We were there for 2 hour but not explore all. Enter the palace must pay, but if you wear hanbok (korea traditional clothes) you can enter free). We rental hanbok at LOK GALLERY (picture number 2) the owner very2 patient(you can see from the first picture- wearing black), but my kids rental at different place but the owner was rude(last picture). The first time we go to their place becauce it is in front of the main stret, but after now the owner like that, me, mum and husband looking another place and found LOK GALLERY(from the the gallery i book for my kids just walk forward you can find the LOK GALLERY, located in small stret. At certain time there is performance at a field before enter the palace (at that time i saw at 2 pm), so if you don’t want pay, you can still see the performance. If you want to see the garden and small lake (the view here was good)after enter you can go to left side. Must visit palace if you go to korea."
2576,4.0,"Many royal palaces, some unfortunately under re-construction. Good to stroll around even wihout a guide."
2577,5.0,It gives you a sense of traveling back in time. Gyeongbokgung palace is a great place to visit with your family and friends. You can even try on their traditional Hanbok ( traditional Korean outfit ) if you want to feel and look authentic. Took a tour around the whole palace and the view was utterly breathtaking. One of the best palace I've ever been too. 9/10
2578,5.0,"GyeongBokGung is absolutely stunning and beautiful! History is alive here and everything has been preserved so well. I'm so happy to see such thriving history and stunning culture of what royal life must have been like to come alive right before my eyes. Everything as soon as you enter the gate, to the changing of the guards, the buildings, and throne room -- ALL is stunning. You don't want to miss this!  NOTE: I believe this palace is open everyday for tourism and it's super cheap! I only paid like $2 or $3 dollars and my teenage sister was half price. So this is definitely a lengthy and cheap tour for the whole family! Enjoy!"
2579,4.0,Just when you think you've seen all the grounds...there's more. Great place to visit in any season !!
2580,5.0,"My husband and I wanted to go back to Hong Kong (our hometown) celebrated his birthday. We stayed in Seoul for 5 days and then to Hong Kong for 5 days. Seoul was very nice and clean, younger Korean speak English. We didn’t have enough time to visit all palaces, I picked Gyeongbokgung Palace to see the changing of the Royal Guards. It was amazing! Seoul is easy to get around with great rail system. We would go again to the Gyeongbokgung Palace again when next time we visit in Seoul again."
2581,5.0,"If you like about the culture of Korea, you should go here for enjoying the culture of it. In this place also a time for the changing of the guard of the palace, a museum about the Korean culture, and the building are still in a very good condition. If you use Hanbok (Korean traditional clothes) you don't have to pay for the entrance fee which is 3,000 won or around 2.7 USD"
2582,4.0,I had a great time at the palace. It was pretty much what I expected when I arrived. I loved the contrast between the old architecture and the new buildings in the background. Worth the small fee! And make sure you catch the changing of the guards.
2583,5.0,"If in Seoul, you have to visit this place. Make sure to check opening hours and days that are closed. Sometimes, there are events and the palace can be closed.  Take comfortable shoes, since you will be walking a lot. Make sure to take a hat and water with you as well.  It will take at least 2 or 3 hours to check out most of the spots. You will be able to take some lovely photos of the palace and the beautiful settings there. It must have been so quiet and peaceful back then.  I have made it to 155 countries. I have an extensive blog at pinchetravels.com, if you want to read more about my travels."
2584,3.0,"The palace is so much humorous. One the best place to take a picture, you can rent Hanbok dress at the store behind the palace and get free entrance the palace so you don’t have to buy a ticket at front of this place."
2585,5.0,"In terms of size and magnificence it's the second best of the 4 palaces in my opinion. However, this one gets the most tourist because it's right in the middle of the city with a big statue in front of it. It's the palace of one of the wisest king in Korea who also invented the modern Korean writing script in an attempt to replace the Chinese script.  Inside it's beautiful with many places to walk around and enjoy a nice day in the park. The palaces and buildings, like all other 4 palaces, could be that much better enhanced if they actually placed ancient artifacts/furniture in there instead of a big empty room. Most of them are locked up..."
2586,4.0,This was super interesting to see. The tickets are only $3 to go inside and walk around. The grounds are expanse which is crazy because it sits in the middle of Seoul. There were guards dressed up along with several of the visitors. Men and women wearing transitional outfits. Unsure if this is the norm or we were there on a special day. It’s mostly outdoors so prepare for rain or shine. The walking is easy. A section of the pond was closed for reconstruction. Definitely worth seeing if in Seoul.
2587,5.0,"Plan a whole morning to visit this palace. Its bigger than i imagined. Start by watching the Guard Exchange. Buy the Combo ticket, that includes 5 total Palaces/Temples around Seoul."
2588,3.0,Good place to revisit Korean history. Otherwise the place doesn't really have much of other stuff to do. Imperial soldiers will parade the ground every few hours. Great photo-taking opportunity. Otherwise 1 to 2 hours here should be sufficient.
2589,4.0,"The main palace in Seoul, located in a straight line with the statue of Admiral Yi Soon Shin, the Great King Sejong, and the Gwanghwamun Gate. You can enter for free when you wear hanbok (Korean traditional costume) which you can rent from places across the palace for around KRW 7,500 to 10,000 for 2 hours, or you can pay KRW 3,000 to enter. The palace is very spacious. At the end there is the throne room which you can see only from outside. Beside the palace, there is an adjacent garden and smaller living quarters. Great for taking pictures and to just absorb the places whete the royal once lived. During certain time, there is a changing guards activities at the main Gwanghwamun Gate."
2590,5.0,"Really beautiful palace grounds. Lots of interesting areas, with different views. There’s an area for traditional performances. And a crafts shop. Throne room in view and 7 story pagoda."
2591,5.0,Very nice palace. Think Forbidden City but on a smaller scale. Great recreation of changing of the guard.
2592,5.0,"If you're in Seoul, you really need to visit this place. Amazing, also has a good museum inside which is worth a look."
2593,5.0,A totally unexpected bonus was that when exiting the station there were a group of high school volunteers who offered to take you around absolutely free. They were a part of a programme and professionally presented so we used them. Our guide was Daniel Shin who was extremely knowledgeable spoke excellent English and adapted to our curiosity and interests. For one so young he was excellent in painting a story of the palace over the ages. We would have been worse off without him and the programmme for youngsters they run.
2594,5.0,"This is where your visit through Seoul must start: the Great Palace! Spectacular, magnificent, a reminder of the culture once Koreans shared with Chinese. Located among New Seoul, this Palace reminds u of the dynasties in this place. You can perfectly picture the outside fortress or wall, the inside chambers for the people close to the emperor, the emperor’s palace, the opulence of his room, the gardens, exits, streets and hallways. Take as many pics as you can, every little space is awesome! Get there by metro, the Station has the same name as the palace, within walking distance you can also find downtown and many local restaurants."
2595,4.0,The first palace built in the Joseon dynasty - very majestic and impressive. Went on a guided tour of the palace 2 years ago and this time we stumbled upon a late opening in the evening. Entrance was only 3000 won and there were 500 tickets reserved for foreigners. There were many people in hanbok and performances on a stage so it was a great atmosphere. The palace looked stunning lit up. A must-visit in Seoul!
2596,5.0,The vastness of the palatial palace can't be captured with a picture. It is absolutely splendid. I suggest you do the hanbok rental. Also use the metro to travel to the palace as it takes you to the doorstep of the palace and its the cheapest method and best method of transportation. A must see!!
2597,5.0,With rented hanbok we enjoyed the palace and it was really a wonderful experience! Definately must see!
2598,5.0,"There are 4 more palaces in the city but this is the one to visit if you need to pick one. ¥3000 entrance fee for an adult. Beautiful palace grounds. Free guided tours. If you rent a traditional costume palace waive the entrance fee. Although I don’t feel it (cultural appropriation) is right thing to do, yet it looks great on the majestic palace grounds. There is a near by museum with historic artifacts and detailed facts about Korean history. A must see!!!"
2599,5.0,Get to know the history of Korea by visiting one of this majestic palace. The architect and colors are out of this world. Try to experience yourself the fine details of the palace.
2600,5.0,"It is really worth od seeing. If your love old asian architecture, you will love this old palace. They have free english guide every 2 hours I think. So you will have better experience from this place."
2601,5.0,"This place is pretty big! Very pretty and picturesque, lots of areas to walk around and enjoy. People wearing traditional clothing, snack shop with coffee etc available (pricey though!) we spent 3 hours here in total and enjoyed it."
2602,5.0,Very elaborate architectural design from the past. The Gyeongbokgung palace is a must for every traveler! Really inexpensive to get in and plenty of beautiful things to witness inside the palace premises.
2603,5.0,"I had a two hour visit to the Gyeongbok palace with a tour guide miss Sue Chung, a government certified English tour guide. The palace is gigantic in location with many chambers such as working and residential. The Gyeongbokgung Palace, which once had more than 7,000 rooms. The palace was restored in 1867. The palace is truly worth it. By the way, you will surely need to take a bottle of water, sunglasses and a hat with you. We rented traditional Korean attire for photos and roaming around the palace. The shopkeeper was the one who selected our attire with bright colors.  SEE photos."
2604,5.0,"Beautiful site, huge area. We spent over 6 hours there and could have spent another 6 looking around. The changing of the guard takes place at 10:00 am and 2:00 pm - definitely worth seeing. The grounds are gorgeous, peaceful.  You forget about the bustling city outside the gates and lose yourself in centuries of history. The buildings are intriguing, the detail impressive. The mountains surrounding the palace are a majestic backdrop for the views and photos.  The museum included in the price of entry spans two floors with an excellent collection of artifacts and glimpses of what life would have been like over the centuries. We only had an hour at the museum which was okay for a quick look. Next time I'll allow minimum 2 - 3 hours.  Well worth seeing!"
2605,5.0,Amazing place to get involved into old days of Korean culture.  You can find several place to take and become a nice photographer.  Just a peaceful place. Highly recommended
2606,4.0,Try to make the free performances of the guards. We saw all 3 performances. The palace is huge so wear comfortable walking shoes and pack water. It's difficult to decide whether this palace or Changdeokgung is better. Each has its unique charm. Took us about 4 hours to see all the shows and tour the palace.
2607,5.0,The palace is a nice place to visit and learn of the countries history. the compound is made up of a number of building all having its own use and part in the kingdom.. give at least a few hours to roam and enjoy the area. check the changing of the guards schedule. there is free guided tours by students on the weekends you can find them in the subway going to the palace.. very knowledgeable kids doing the tour.. you wont regret
2608,4.0,Good place. You can feel the cultural vibe is well preserved. Since view for the some photo snap. You can feel the vibe of being back in the past.
2609,5.0,A beautiful peaceful place in the center of the city. I recommend buying the integrated palace ticket as it offers great saving
2610,5.0,Visited the palace while in S. Korea (Seoul) for my sons wedding. This was a great stop and great lesson in S. Korea’s history.
2611,5.0,"Large Palace complex adjacent to government precinct. Beautifully rebuilt and very well maintained. Can self-navigate, and different language brochures available including English. Check tines for opening and changing of guard (a colourful highlight). Plan for 1.5 to 2 hours."
2612,5.0,"i am interested in historical place, if you do then you need to go here. They have a hanbok rental around the palace, so you can really walk around using hanbok like you are in joseon dynasty. The place it self is interesting."
2613,5.0,Would have wanted to experience during the different seasons but being there in summer was already breathtaking.
2614,3.0,We visited all the four palaces & a shrine with the integrated ticket system(for more details check their official website). As far as my personal opinion i didnt enjoy much. My thoughts and expectation where to view the lifestyle of the Korean kings and Queens. In order to experience that we need to see the things they used the same replica of things atleast....but all we saw were just long or small plain halls with not much furnitures or things used by the kings and queens. Most of the halls or rooms were locked and not open for public. This palace was the biggest in area with many halls and grounds. As far as we saw people were just wandering about here and there just like us. May be if we had chosen the guided tour we would have known which place served for which purpose...but then too we dont get to see and imagine ourselves how lives would have been for the Royal family! Its my personal opinion...i dont mean to put down the spirits of visitors who are eager to visit soon or tourists who just get satisfied to set foot into the Royal ground. All 4 palaces were the same.
2615,4.0,We joined the English free guided tour for the palace and gained many interesting insights to the palace that we wouldn't have known otherwise!
2616,5.0,Great landmark tells on the Korean history and king Queen Palace. Good for hannok photography. Will visit again
2617,5.0,"beautiful place. learned a lot about the history of Korea. Also they offer free guided tours which was really cool! Our guide was a high school senior who graduates soon (Riley), she was very aware and informative about the history of Korea and the Palace. Definitely worth the visit. Also if you dress up in traditional Korean clothing you get in for free."
2618,4.0,It’s pretty relaxed not much to do but actually see the palace so it’s great for learning about the culture pretty sure there are some guided tours I actually just got a ticket and explored was fun and a little confusing there is a museum on site but they were closed when I was there all in all it’s a good place to get a walk about in and see and feel a little history at the same time also some really good photo spots for scrapbookers
2619,3.0,"Gyeongbokgung is conveniently located near it's same name metro station. Managed to catch the changing of guards before entering the compound (entrance fee is 3000won per adult).  Within the compound, because we didn't go for the guided tour, most of the time we felt quite lost :(  I would think a guided tour would add more content and insights, rather than just random walking and photo taking within the compound."
2620,5.0,A great place to go learn about Korean traditon and stuffs. Good operation for a touristic site.....
2621,4.0,"I went here by korean metro, if you go here on weekend, there is a bunch of students who offer a free tour for the palace, the students explanation is a lot better since they are better in english that the tour guide inside. Make sure you wear a warm clothes if you visit in winter, the wind here was pretty strong."
2622,5.0,"Place is beautiful. Large. And only cost 3 or 4 dollars for entry and free if you wear traditional Hanbok clothing which can be purchased outside the temple for a few from between $15-$50 dollars for 2 hrs depending on the store and how detailed you want yourself to look (i.e make up, accessories, clothing choice from standard to premium etc) You can go with a tour guide who will fill you in on who stayed where and what each building was or you can go on your own as we did and discover the place yourself. definitely recommend it."
2623,3.0,We went here with matching traditional Korean clothes.  We got lucky that there were ceremonies that we get to see.  My tip is to bring lots of water. You can also buy inside. Not advisable to bring toddlers in strollers.  No entrance fee.
2624,5.0,"Also one of the more beautiful palaces of Seoul but besides walking around for a good couple of hours inside these grounds, the rotation of the guards performance was the highlight. Don't remember how often it happens but be on the outside of the entrance when it does. It takes place at the entrance near Gwanghwuman."
2625,5.0,"If you rent the traditional costume (hanbok) for the nearby shop (just check with the staff at the entrance), you get to go into the palace for free. If not, entrance fee will have to be paid after the first courtyard.  Palace is really big and you will get an idea of the various functions of the different buildings if you have a local guide with you. If not, just listen in to the various guides who are shouting commentaries.  As for photo opportunities, there are heaps and it just multiplies if you come dressed in their traditional costumes which a lot of the visitors do anyway, so you will not be the odd one out.  There is not much shade beyond the buildings so bring some headdress as it is quite hot from noon onwards. In summer anyway."
2626,4.0,"I was so shocked to find such immaculately preserved ancient history in the middle of such a bustling city! Loved seeing the other visitors in their transitional dress for the tours. The picturesque mountain in the background, ponds, trees, and temples are exactly what you’re looking for in a great photo-op."
2627,5.0,Closed on Tuesdays. Found out only after we got there so had to come back another day. Overall a great experience. We revisited on Wed and it happened to be their cultural day so it was free entry. Downside are the crowds on that day with lots of students visiting. But still a must visit place
2628,3.0,"Like other places in Mainland China, this Palace dont have many things to see. All buildings were similar with chinese deco and tipical. almost half of the palace filled with sand field. No ete catching gardens that make our visit impressed. Only visitors with traditional hanbok dress could attract your eyes."
2629,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the most fascinating things to do in Seoul. Plan to spend at least 2 1/2 hours there, perhaps more if it particularly interests you. The site is huge and includes multiple buildings and gardens. Just next to the grounds are also the interesting Palace Museum and Korean Folk Museum, both worth a visit."
2630,5.0,A comfortable park located in the city downtown are of Seoul. We enjoyed walking through and learning the history behind this site.
2631,4.0,"When you come up to the castle you will see places rent teen out traditional Korean clothing. I later discovered that you can get in the palace for free if you are wearing an outfit. If I remember correctly it was 3000 to get in or 10,000 for admittance to three palaces and One additional attraction. At certain times of the day they have a changing of the guard ceremony which is fun to watch."
2632,4.0,I would go on a weekend so you can see everyone wearing beautiful traditional clothing. There isn't much to do when you get there but its nice to walk around just take a few hours to yourself.
2633,5.0,"Get there at 10am or 2pm for guard changing ceremony. Adds value to your visit. After the changing ceremony, you may take fotos with the guards at the gate. The palace is a place to visit to learn more about joesan dynasty. I had an interesting time there with a local guide. Best to read up before you go so that u can appreciate the culture and palace more."
2634,5.0,Rented the traditional Korean dresses (hanbok) with a Korean friend at a shop close the palace. We took a lot of photos at the palace and had a lot of fun. Highly recommend it if you want to feel like a princess and travel back in time. I would recommend good and comfortable footwear as the palace is quite big and it took us a couple of hours (plus photo time) to finish.
2635,4.0,My only real complaint is that there really aren't enough English explanations.  I enjoyed walking around but a lot of the time you have no clue what you are looking at.  That said its easily accessible well maintained and very affordable.
2636,4.0,I decided to visit with my friend. Entrance is very inexpensive and you get to see a huge palace. I must have walked over 7miles. From hotel to palace and back again.  There is a little cool feature that you could enjoy. In the middle street there is a huge statue of one of the smarter kings. You will see a little hut so check it out. The lend some period costumes for free and a spot where you can take a nice picture.
2637,4.0,"It's an interesting place. Wear a hanbok and you can get in for free! It's a very big place so make sure to wear comfortable footwear. They have free flyers where you can read about each structure. And I think they offer FREE walking tours (but it's only at designated times). We weren't able to catch the changing of the guard ceremony so i have no comment on that. The palace grounds is huge and after a while, the buildings all seem to look the same."
2638,5.0,"Oh this was my favorite, i will come back for sure. We rented a hanbok for 10000won(10$) for two hours but we just finished for just 1hour so it is truly worth it and we only rented not the premium ones as we were trying to save money for other stuffs. I think there is an entrance fee but if you wearing a hanbok it is free. The palace is really a huge place. We dont know which way to go left or right but i think some of them are typical. I am looking for the lake it was on the left aide. I’ve watched a lot of historical dramas so it was like i’ve seen it before and for me as akdrama addict it felt so magical. It was like living from ancient times. It was summer so remember to put sunblock and get ready to sweat from wearing hanbok hehehe. Oh by the way the other lake was close but you can view it only in small windows from the fence."
2639,4.0,"It was really hot in early Jun so please put on sunblock for your little ones. The palace is a good place to visit if you wish to understand the korean culture and history. Be sure to catch the parade at the palace square. Please find out when the s A visit to the museum first (opposite the ticketing booth) will be most useful because it allows us to appreciate the place better. In comparison, this palace may not be as grand as the forbidden city."
2640,4.0,Largest and most famous palace in South Korea. Identical to Forbidden city in China. Beautiful Korean architecture. Many locals comes there wearing traditional costumes called Hanbok. Not only for locals anyone can hire these outfits and entry will be free of charge. We were there on time to watch royal guard ceremony in their traditional uniforms carrying flags & weapons. Unique on it own way. Beautiful garden with cherry blossoms in season. Must stop at Hyangwanji pond to see the grand pavilion. Palace closes at 6 pm. Wear comfy shoes . Great place to see their culture and traditions.
2641,5.0,"Time travel is true to this well preserved palace. Despite being in the middle of busy CBD, the times goes back a couple of century when you're inside the gates. To complete your experience, Hanbok rentals are available outside the palace for KRW 5,000-KRW10,000. And yes, the KRW5,000 ones are good set but the shops are located at quite a distance from the palace entrance. ^,^. English speaking tour guides are also available for free. Their stories will make you appreciate the palace more. Just check their schedules near the entrance. If you're a morning person, you can check for changing guards ceremony ^,^. It's really a must see!"
2642,5.0,"If you are looking at traveling back into the main city center of Korean Dynasties, you are looking for Gyeongnbokgung! Make sure to wear a traditional Korean Outfit for a discounted fare in certain circumstances!  I highly recommend for travelers with families.  Enjoy!"
2643,4.0,"I recommend this place for hanbok picture taking. There are a lot of people dressed in traditional Korean clothes which adds to the feel of the whole experience. We stayed here for almost two hours, just taking pictures."
2644,5.0,A must to visit. Very big place so we did not cover the whole area. Spent about 1.5 hours inside... There’s a small fee to enter the palace and it’s crowded everywhere.. You may want to find out the timing for changing of guards. Nothing interesting but we so happen to be there when it happened.
2645,4.0,"This is a great tourist attraction. They make no bones that the palace is not an original and was rebuilt in 1868 after being ruined for 300 years. At 10AM they have a tourist spectacle when they do a changing of the guard ceremony which is very colourful. That takes place in the first courtyard, which is a huge enclosure. From here you proceed to various staterooms, sleeping quarters and then a small garden. The restoration has been nicely done so you can get a feel of how the place used to be. The chimneys are interesting, being outside of the buildings and I think there is one original fireplace and chimney from the 1360's. It was a shame that when we were there the gardens behind the main palace that had a pavillion in the middle of a lake of waterlillies, was actually closed. Admission was 3000 won and there are plenty of bus stops right by the front gate."
2646,4.0,"We went to visit the palace just before sunset and it was really stunning to see the palace in the evening light and later on with the lights on. We were extremely lucky to hear and see performances of traditional singing and music that evening. Wonderful palace, really worth a visit when you are in Seoul."
2647,5.0,bring a hat or umbrella but its great. with enough facilities for whatever you need. there is even an MRT entrance within the palace ground
2648,5.0,We visited all five of the big palaces in the city and found Gyeongbokgung together with Changdeokgung to be the most impressive ones. While you can't really enter any of the buildings it's worth a visit for the impressive view on the gate alone.
2649,5.0,"One of the biggest palaces in central Seoul and I'm impressed by how well-kept the place is. It feels like you can step back in time and feel what it was like a few hundred years ago. Something you might not know is that you can rent a hanbok (Korean traditional dress) from the nearby areas and enter the palace(s) for free. I got mine from Hanboknam but there are a ton all around the palace. Might as well get it and feel like a part of the era. Little things like the changing of guard ceremony also help in helping visitors appreciated what it was like in the past.  I would have appreciated if there were picture signage to help me identify where I was within the palace. That said it would have broke into the whole authenticity of the space. Overall it's a beautiful timepiece symbolic of an older Korea. Worth 1-2 hours of just visiting and wandering around, more if you're wearing a hanbok and taking pictures."
2650,4.0,This palace is really nice to see even knowing that it's all reconstructed. The this is that you need to take your time to go around because it takes at least 2-3 hours to go around and see everything. The library at the end is also very nice.
2651,5.0,I think that if you are out of Asia you will be very impressed once you visit any palace in Seoul. You need to visit them.
2652,5.0,It’s beautiful lovely place so many thing to see and amazing garden and you can see a blue house where is the Korean President live !! Very clean good place to visit and relax !! You can shop and have coffee shop too !! You can walk or take MRT or bus if you stay in the center of city ! I do love Seoul very much will come back next week June 5
2653,4.0,"With just 3000 entry fee, this place was worth the visit. It is huge and I would recommend visiting during 4 in the evening when the sun is not harsh and it closed by 6 PM, so 2 hours would be a good time here. I recently heard about the night tour, if they have it - go for it. Gardens, palaces and museums - a long walk but a good experience."
2654,5.0,"Gorgeous, history filled and truly a spectacle. Be there by 10am to witness the ceremony of guard change, 11am if you want the free tour guide (which is highly recommended because you really feel attached to the place).."
2655,3.0,Didn't enter because it's too hot. End up visit the national museum nearby which is great to visit as well.
2656,4.0,"If you haven't seen korean tradional buildings (palaces, temples etc), you should go here to appreciate the style. They also have a change of guard ceremony in traditional clothes. Once you have seen it, be aware that every other traditional building in korea has near identical shapes, colors etc."
2657,5.0,A must to visit this place when you are in Seoel This Ares is completely renovatie and give you A good idea of the past. The buildings and the area inside are wonderpil. Surely you wil make beautifull pictures
2658,5.0,"It was a wonderful experience visiting this place. We went to Anguk station to rent a hanbok before going to Gyeongbukgung. This palace is huge and beautiful, great places for picture. Free entrance should you dress in hanbok, must visit at least once."
2659,5.0,"So beautiful and large with many small old buildings inside. The architecture is so wonderful and unique. I had a great experience with Hanbok - a Korean traditional dress there. You should try to rent one (they have all clothings for men, women and children also with many styles and colors) and take some pictures with this place. In addition, you can go inside for free if you wear Korean traditonal clothings, so cool!"
2660,4.0,"Good place. Must visit. Know about a lot of history, the rulers etc. It shows about their dynasty, about the king etc."
2661,4.0,"I rented a hanbok and visit Gyeongbukgung, if you do that you can get in for free! However eventhough it was mid-week, it was very crowded and it was hard to enjoy the scene fully. But I definitely enjoyed it!"
2662,5.0,"This is really one of the must visit attraction for any visit to Seoul. It's nicely preserved and clean, expect during our visit, there is some area under renovation and closed off."
2663,5.0,"To visit a country so proud of its cultural heritage is pleasant. So much time has been taken to not only rebuild a nation so recently devastated by war, but to rebuild a historical journey of a country that has been in the middle of conflict since ancient times. Gyeongbokgung was the primary Palace and stronghold of the King and when you see it you will understand why. The skill to build such a place without the technology of today is breathe taking. Don't just look at the walls and the buildings, take the time to look at how they were constructed and how they fit in with the other palaces, shrines and protective walls that were built to repel invasions. When you sit and take in the sheer expanse of these sites and the amount of people it took to make them run it is mind blowing. To see early ducted underground heating in these ancient sites is stunning. Sit in the gardens, take photos and enjoy everything the site has to offer."
2664,4.0,It is easy to get off at one subway stop and travel to many sites on foot through a day in this area. The palace was made even more beautiful with Koreans dressed up in hanboks that you can rent from local shops. Pictures were very fun!
2665,5.0,"We only had two days in Seoul and this was one of the first places we headed to see. I am very glad we did - the palace was beautiful and its surrounding grounds large and stunning. You could easily spend a whole day just walking around and taking in the different areas, however I would recommend setting aside two hours for a good feel of the place. It is definitely worth paying the low fee of the entrance ticket to fully enjoy the grounds and not just the entrance area.  What really adds to the historic feeling is the many beautiful dresses worn by Koreans. Shops in the area will rent out historic costumes and many Korean girls and couples can be seen taking photos within the palace grounds. It's a beautiful sight that's worth seeing. If you're daring, perhaps rent out a costume yourself for a nice photo-shoot? The grounds definitely have loads of opportunities for lovely pictures than cannot be taken anywhere else."
2666,4.0,It's just Palace which no longer original. But it's still worth spending time while in Seoul. And all the buildings look the same.
2667,5.0,"It was my place that I visited just after I arrived At least I discovered immediately the Korean culture and ambiance You should see the Guards who wear traditional dress, the 3 mains courtyards are full with locals who rent traditional costumes But the others part of the royal complexe are empty and full of serinity It s like a city inside the city All was destroyed but the gouvernement decided to rebuild it as it was and they win the challenge It s stunning If you love take pictures be ready!"
2668,4.0,Lovely palace with lots of history to learn about. Try and catch the traditional Korean music concert that happens near the cafe/gift shop cause it was really good!
2669,3.0,This palace is to be visited when in Seoul and the best part of the day was seeing the people. When I went there was a festival of Korean Culture where people dressed up in traditional clothing and wandered the site.  To be honest I’ve visited too many of these temples of late but it is impressive and if you can go at night (which I did not - I saw a friends pictures) it is more impressive.  There are stores nearby that rent the traditional clothing so if you are interested you too can look like you fit in.
2670,5.0,Love the palace and the vibe ! All girls and boys dressed up in Hanbok traditional clothes and as colorful and royal as it looks.
2671,4.0,"Bought a good deal from kkday for Php 899/person for a 6hr rental of hanbok. The location of the hanbok studio is strategical since it’s in front of the gate of this palace. Wearing traditional dress like hanbok will free yourself from paying entrances for most of the palaces. I believe Changdeokgung palace is the only palace that’s asking for an entrance fee even if you’re are wearing hanbok, as I’ve heard this is the most beautiful and instagrammable of all. We did not able to visit all palaces on the same day because of the limited time. We thought 6hrs is enough to explore those, but I was wrong, since palaces are far from each other. Gyeongbokgung is a huge palace and most of the time it’s crowded, but we did enjoy the sight seeings, go ahead and take a picture with the doors and walls, it’s instagrammable. The comfort is very far so I suggest you take one map from the tourist information, if you plan to wear hanbok, (Irecommend that for a full experience) I suggest you rent a 24hr and do it very early so that you can explore all the palaces. All the palace close at 6pm. But you can opt to rent for hours more cheaper then take a cab going to other palaces too. This the way going there: Take a subway going gyeongbokgung station and exit 3-1 there’s many hanbok rental on that exit. But if you don’t like wearing one just go straight up to the other side of entrance. Please download Seoul subway map."
2672,5.0,"If you visit korea, this palace is a must to visit. This place is amazing and this palve is a site of korean saeguk drama shooting place. Dont forget to watch change guardian ceremony and wear ur hanbok so you could enter this place free (with no hanbok u must pay 3000won)"
2673,5.0,"This palace is worth visiting if you are in Seoul. Will need to pay an entrance fee but the place is big enough for a couple of hours of touring. Do check out the timing for change of Guards ceremony, will be worth watching. Remember to check out the museum too, free admission for palace visitors."
2674,5.0,"Most all the Palace buildings were demolished during the Japanese occupation in the early 1900s and restored in the 1990s. The buildings are still stunning with mountains in the background to the north and west. When we were there, there were a great number of school children as well as about 10% of people walking around in hanboks, the traditional dress. There are free guided tours available. We were with a private tour."
2675,3.0,"One of the biggest palace in Seoul that we were recommended to visit. However after heading over, we realised there was not much to see. However, it proves as a good spot for photo-taking if in Hanbok as it matches the theme. Luckily for us, it wasn't overly crowded and photo-taking was a breeze. However depending on the locations of the hanbok rental shop, the journey to the palace may take up to 30min!"
2676,4.0,It offers a nice atmosphere to walk around and learn the history. Morning time to visit is better as we have to walk a lots
2677,5.0,This site is definitely worth waiting for in the evening. The lighting shows the fabulous colors of the facades and decorative woodwork. Enjoy the walk through the walled palace and gardens.
2678,5.0,"One of the best places in Seoul. Rent a hanbok (traditional costume) and walk in the palace. There is a view to the river, and a park there. Enjoy also the guard change."
2679,4.0,Probably the most famous for palace visitors in Seoul. Wear hanbok for a free entrance to the grounds. Nice place for taking pictures.
2680,3.0,We only went to this palace due to the limited time we had. Perhaps it's ignorance and lack of knowledge but it was one big building (palace i assume) in a huge enclosed area. The best part for us however was to dress in traditional hanboks and take pictures- again perhaps ignorance on my part to not being able to appreciate the history and significance of this.
2681,4.0,"We lived in Seoul more than a decade ago and visited the palace then. It seems more beautiful than I remembered it. The palace is situated right in the city with mountains on the side.  We saw many tourists wearing hanboks, the traditional Korean dress. Apparently, there were some rental places just right outside the palace. We went by metro and our exit led us straight to the palace so we missed the shops. My two daughters thought it would be nice to dress up and take photos on the Palace grounds.  We spent about two hours here."
2682,5.0,"Is amazing in korea. Make me like korean girl, hanbok and the kingdom of republic korea. I love this vacation"
2683,4.0,"You might want to wear your most comfortable shoes, and avoid summer time. We came August of last year and it was so hot. But worth it. It's interesting and impressive, happy to see that they maintained it."
2684,5.0,The first palace . Burn down during war. The best thing is the guard change process in the morning 9.30 . U can see the actual history . If u wear the traditional Korean dress the entry ticket is free.
2685,3.0,"Happened to walk into the palace thinking of going to the palace museum and coincidentally it was exactly the time for the guards changing ceremony.  It was certainly interesting and quite an experience. Not so sure, but I do think they keep to traditions and everything is authentic.  The whole ceremony took about 15 mins. There was Chinese, English, Japanese commentary alongside Korean.  Kinda pity the guards though, had to stand straight without moving a muscle while out in the cold weather. But I guess back them hundreds of years ago that's what they did."
2686,5.0,"We came here since it was part of the Discover Seoul Pass. The palace is one of the first things that you see but what we didn't know was that the palace grounds had plenty of other things to look at. We spent a morning just walking around looking at the different buildings and views. The building over the lake, Gyeonghoeru, was an interesting one to see. We also ended up in a display for Princess Myeongseong which was nice cause it was inside one of the buildings. The maps were handy and since it's all numbered, it's fairly easy to get around and find the area you are looking for. We ended up leaving at an exit near the National Folk Museum. A really interesting place where you can easily spend a day just looking at all the different buildings."
2687,5.0,"One of the many palaces in Seoul, this one is a must see. The grounds and palace are well kept and you will be sure to get a taste of Korean history. Be sure to do a tour if you can."
2688,4.0,It’s the largest palace in Korea so it’s huge and impressive but there is a lot of walking around in the sun (there is little shade there). Wear comfortable shoes!
2689,5.0,Excellent place to walk around; as well as; noting all of the beautiful costumes worn by many. I would visit again but at a different time because of the amount of people there. A huge palace with a lot of area to cover.
2690,5.0,A great spot to take a pics or vlogging! Although i was here when it was winter (its suuuuper cold) but i really like the palace :( i havent explore this place much bcs of the bad weather. But this palace is so great ok recommended
2691,4.0,Very nice place to walk around and enjoy the old Korea. Hanging out here is a must and you may even wan to wear traditional dresses.
2692,3.0,"We came here after visiting Changdeokgung Palace, as we had the Secret Garden tour booked for 10:30am, so by the time we got here, it was already super crowded. Changdeokgung was nothing like this, not many people at all. Anyway, so we bought tickets and started walking around. The grounds are huge, so many houses etc. to see but I wasn't as impressed with Gyeongbokgung as I was with Changdeokgung. I have to say though that the Secret Garden at Changdeokgung was my favorite things, so maybe that's way. If I'd come again, I'd visit first thing in the morning, or just before they close. It's still nice though, not to miss."
2693,4.0,"What impressive about this place it is in the heart of Seoul. A mini escape. we arrived on a Wednesday and it was free entry. Beautiful grounds, amazing history. When I go back to Seoul I will go back for another look as it is definitely worthwhile."
2694,4.0,"A short visit to this place. I went to this place with the Korean traditional cloth - Hanbok. We rent the cloth nearby this place. When we visited Gyeongbokgung, the place is big and quiet crowded because it was the first week of spring and the students got two free-day. Well we didn't really get complete information about this place because our short time and we preferred to make some photos."
2695,5.0,"Having visited the Forbidden Palace in Beijing, the Seoul counterpart is smaller, less crowded, more quaint, but no less grand. The aesthetics and beauty are Superior to Beijing in almost every way.  Also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the place feels earthy and calm. Of course, the city has sprouted up all around, obscuring what must have once been a superlative view. The palace and gardens are quite magnificent. There is quite a bit of greenery and foilage unlike the Forbidden City. While it is impossible to not compare the two, the Seoul Palace stands on its own as a place of magnificance and wonder.  Get the Royal Pass and visit at least the Secret Garden and the Temple across the street. Worth the extra few 1000 won(2-3 dollars)"
2696,4.0,Wear a hanbok and enter free. Well preserved with huge grounds. Structures were maintained. We were not able to watch the famous changing of the guards but you can take photo with them. Background of the palaces were made where you can read in english version. Easy access trough gyeongbokgung station.
2697,4.0,Changdeokgung palace is called the palace of illustrious virtue. It is a unique Korean palace built in harmony with the landscape. While we were there we were lucky enough to see the people dressed in national costumes a great photo opportunity.
2698,4.0,"Going to historical places is such an interesting thing, you can see the colorful buildings the way they were built, in places like these you will probably see people wearing their traditional Korean attire waking around taking pictures which is popular to do"
2699,5.0,Very peaceful and our favorite Palace of South Korea. You can rent a traditional dress (Renting places are very close to this Palace and we rented it 15.000 Won for 2 hours)
2700,4.0,"This palace inherits centuries of history way back from 15th. It was destroyed and rebuilt somewhere in 19th century. Fully built with wood, the main meeting hall is an amazing architecture. Can spend a half day in here, including the neighbouring muzeum."
2701,4.0,"Visited the palace with kids, the palace had guards dressed in their traditional outfits there were heaps of tourists dressed in traditional dresses too really colorful and a pretty site. The palace itself is quite large has multiple gates and building. You could spend anywhere from 30 mins to a couple of hours. There are restrooms around the a traditional tea house. There is also attached is a arts museum which can be visited"
2702,4.0,"This is a nice looking palace with large grounds. The experience is heightened by dressing in the colourful traditional Korean clothes called hanbok. You get free entry to the palace grounds if you wear a hanbok and you won't be out of place as there are many others wearing hanbok as well. We were able to get men and women hanbok for 5000 won each for 2 hours, at ABC Hanbok Rental which is located on the second floor of a building across the road from the palace on the Geonchunmun Gate side. Changing of guard ceremonies at 1pm and 2pm were worth watching, as well as guard training at 1:35pm. A 'Mexican wave' of swords drill was particularly impressive! There are free guided tours as well. There was an English speaking guided tour at 1:30pm, which seemed quite popular. We didn't go to that as the timing clashed with the guard training session. A good place to get a photo is the banquet hall to the left side surrounded by water and mountain in the background."
2703,5.0,Gyeongbokgung palace is very impressive It is a large place and in the open It tells us about the culture the history and how people lived in that era. It has a lovely walkway enveloped with lovely cherry blossom trees and benches to rest on. A lovely place to capture photographs. It has a small cafe to unwind. Entry is free if one wears the traditional clothes which can be hired in a nearby place. It was wonderful to see so many youngsters wearing their Grady costumes with lovely hairstyles and wearing gorgeous accessories. We took many pictures with them and wished we had also hired those traditional clothes I highly recommend a visit to the Gyeongjokjung Palace
2704,3.0,"Very nice palace, with a beautiful lake, but very crowded and not much to see inside. People seem to go there mostly to take pictures in hanboks and not to experience the place itself. Entrance is very cheap."
2705,5.0,"It’s a lovely complex. I personally skipped the tour because I could get the history online (and there are video clips of the tour). Also, if you are looking for a reduction in crowds, get there just before the changing of the guard (everyone is watching them, so you have more photo opportunities without the crowds). This worked for me because I had other cultural activities on my itinerary. I did a quick walk around by myself in under an hour."
2706,5.0,Absolutely stunning I will recommend fitting a visit while on Seoul. We went on a Sunday and loads of Koreans and even more tourists were dressing up with the traditional Hanok which made the palace and it’s surroundings have an even more special feeling. Need to buy ticket at the counter but costs only around £3. Must do to visit the building with the lake for amazing shots.
2707,4.0,"There are a lot of palaces in Seoul, but Gyeongbokgung is definitely one of the more interesting palaces. It can be quite busy at times so make sure to check the best times of day to visit. If visiting at night is an option I would recommend this during summer as there is an amazing light show running every hour. Friendly to all ages."
2708,5.0,"Impressive palace with lots of history and culture. The place is massive, with lots of ground to cover and sites to see. The moat with island was closed and under maintenance when we visited in April 2018. I think it is set to re-open this fall. You can peek in from open windows and see over the wall at times from around the grounds however.  Located in downtown Seoul, you can see this palace in a couple hours and right next door on the way out is the Nation Folk Museum. I recommend seeing all of the palace before going to the folk museum as you will not be let back on the palace grounds after 5PM."
2709,4.0,We did not realize the scale of this palace complex. The most interesting part was the Koreans (and likely tourists) that dress up in traditional costumes to visit the Palace. This certainly adds to the effect and sense of history.
2710,5.0,Do make sure that you dress up in hanbok (you can hire them nearby) and walk around the grounds of the palace. Make sure you are there for the changing of the guards because it is an amazing sight. It is a truly beautiful palace and a big part of the history of South Korea.
2711,5.0,"Had 13 hours on a layover in Seoul so only enough time to see 1 of the many beautiful sights in the city. So glad I chose Gyeongbokgung Palace. The complex is huge, the architecture stunning. It was quite busy but that did not deter from my enjoyment. Serene, beautiful and made me want to see more so definitely planning a return trip. I would highly recommend a visit if you are in Seoul; even for a layover. Took about 1.5 hours each way to get there from the airport but well worth the time."
2712,5.0,This former kings palace in Korea is amazing. It reminds me of the forbidden city but on a slightly more human scale. I love that one is allowed to just wonder around and linger in shady spots. It is adored by the teenagers who wonder how one could have lived here. I highly recommend a visit even on a short trip to Seoul.
2713,5.0,Beautiful and majestic palace with views of Seoul and the surrounding hills. The self/ guided tour is easy with literature available in multiple languages. Allow enough time to tour the grounds and see the beautiful cherry blossoms (in April) and architecture.
2714,5.0,You can reach here by seoul metro and stop at Gwa ghamun station. The palace is great and have much instagramable spots to take.
2715,5.0,"If one has to pick one palace to visit in Seoul, I would recommend Gyeongbokgung palace! We went at 1000am in the morning and watched the colorful change of guard ceremony. The palace is huge and takes time and lot of walking to explore the entire place. It was spring time and quite beautiful with the cherry blossoms. Lot of tourists and locals in hanbok added to the colorful atmosphere. There is a cafe inside to take rest after walking and warming up in cold weather. The palace is spread out so it doesnt feel crowded even when there are lot of people around. It was an enjoyable visit."
2716,5.0,"It was built in 1395, it continued to serve as the main palace of the Joseon dynasty until the premises were destroyed by fire during the Imjin War and abandoned for two centuries"
2717,4.0,"The place was huge, get your hanbok and you can get inside for free, you could tour all the palaces, it's just the distances between them takes a long walk. One hour is not enough to tour this place."
2718,4.0,"This palace site is REALLY big and even on our guided tour we probably only saw about half of it. Hard to tell what is original and what is rebuilt - take that as a criticism or a compliment, it works both ways.  The changing of the guard was colourful and loud and looked pretty professional.  Lots and lots of schoolkids made it a bit manic at times  Needed lots more insitu explanation boards and direction signs"
2719,4.0,"Palace is beautiful but disappointed that it didn’t have clear directions.  I wish the buildings were labeled with a numbering system (and a starting point) and a more detailed explanation of each structure. Info pamphlet, 500 won, was in very small font and difficult to read.  Also, it would be nice if the cleaning staff can clean and quietly during non-tour hours. They were yelling at each other inside the structures with the tourists looking on.  We were at the Nijo Castle in Kyoto just couple of days prior to this visit. Plenty of explanations and quiet working staff in uniform.  Also, it was disappointing to see sub-par restorations (for some parts) to a national treasure."
2720,5.0,"I think a visit to Seoul for any first timer is not complete without a stopover to this Grand Palace located in the heard of Seoul. A grand palace it is indeed! The grounds were well kept, and the landscaping made it so serene and calm (apart from the busy groups of tourists taking selfies in their beautiful rented hanboks) The changing of the guards is a must see too!"
2721,5.0,"The last time when I took the English tour, the guide was merely running through basics. But I brought my parents along this time around and we joined the Chinese tour. It was one of the most enjoyable time during our stay there. The guide was knowledgeable and friendly."
2722,3.0,"I think is the best historic place in Seoul, but there are better shrines in other Asian countries. If you are not a history gig and don't understand much about these places , so it would like all others shrines. Only thing makes it little different is the size. Is really big."
2723,5.0,Near the palace there are hanbok rent places. You can rent there and take photos at Gyeongbokgung. The palace is look like the one in the dramas so you can pretend to be the protagonist of saeguk dramas for a moment
2724,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace was our highlight of the trip because we rented Hanbok, the traditional dress to take pictures here. For those wear Hanbok or Korean Traditional Clothes, no entrance fee is required.  We rented our Hanbok at a nearby shop. Within walking distance, we can reach the Palace. The scenery was beautiful and when we took the pictures, we thought we were transported back to the ancient time. You can see many different colors and design of Hanbok in the Palace. The view was spectacular.  Gyeongbokgung Palace is the most visited among the five palaces in Seoul. Hence, you can expect the number of visitors here. We took every opportunity to take pictures while admiring the beauty of this Palace. We then visited the museum to learn more about the history of the Palace and the emperors."
2725,5.0,"Great place, if you're wearing a hanbuk (Korean traditional dress) your entrance is totally FREE.. Explore the Korean world, ild Korean Style"
2726,4.0,"If you want a full on memorable experience here, rental a hanbok before you go. The girls wearing them were so cute that I regretted not getting one. This place is great for photo ops and roaming around the entire place to learn about how they lived centuries ago. It’s huge so you could spend at least 2 hours here. Not recommended on a hot summer day because you’re pretty much out out in the open. This one is larger than the UNESCO palace and better in my opinion. If you’re visiting Seoul, Myeongdong this is highly recommended. It’s walking distance to the cute Bukchon Village where people roam around in their hanboks as well. Great experience, I’d do it again but this time wearing a hanbok."
2727,4.0,"A must see location for tourists, but once you see one Korean palace, you've seen all korean palaces."
2728,4.0,a great place to visit. would recommend planning your visit ahead of time as the palace is not open every day (closed on Tuesdays i thInk). There are set times for changing of the guards so again check out the times if you want to see this
2729,5.0,"Try to get to the palace for the 10am guard changing. Seeing all the tourists in traditional costume is hilarious, and like nothing I’ve seen anywhere in the world. Sadly, the palace is mostly a replication of the 14thc original, which burned down and was sacked by conquerers, but still a worthy visit."
2730,3.0,This was the first palace I went to and I'm not sure if I find it that amazing... Probably if I have more time to go around and explore the entire compound. There were many tourists around that was probably why I did not enjoy it that much. It's great for experience purposes if you want to get exposed to Korean culture. There are a lot of things to do outside as well so you need not worry where to eat and stuff. It's also near other famous palaces and Insadong.
2731,5.0,"The largest and oldest palace in Seoul, which is one in five of the palaces.This place combines historical stories,beautiful architecture and nature. I love here. Recommend to visit."
2732,5.0,The place was so big and amazing. Very unique on its own. The people will also perform their traditional dance and parade.
2733,4.0,"When visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace, you must wear the traditional korean clothes ( don't pay the entrance fee ) It gives the tour a special feeling of the past times."
2734,4.0,"Huge and Massive. The two words that you can describe about this Palace. Full of many tourist who wearing old traditional costume of South Korea and walking as well taking picture in many corner of this palace. A must see place that you should visit when in Seoul. Very simple to find and walking distance to some hotels, other tourist area and main attraction."
2735,3.0,"This was a very nice visit, I went for the tour which had a lot of rich information about the culture, architecture and so on. If you wear a hanbok (typical Korean outfit) you can get in for free, they rent them in many places near the palace. I didn't try the hanbok option but I found it as a really cute option especially if you are into taking pictures."
2736,5.0,"The Palace is huge with lots of buildings to see. We were treated to the changing of the guard which had local people dressed in period costumes. The changing of the guard was quite colorful and according to our guide was authentic. One could take a lot of pictures of the changing of the guard in addition to the interior and exterior of the various buildings that were on the palace grounds. On the palace ground is also the National Palace Museum of Korea which housed a good collection of the emperor's personal belongings, the cars, clothes, and items used in the daily living. Between the Palace and the Museum, plan to spend about 4 hours plus to see everything. There is also a small snack stand where one can get a cold drink and sit for some time to rest up."
2737,5.0,It’s fun if you rent the Korean traditional clothes (hanbok) and visit it free. The hanbok gives the place a festive atmosphere. The place is big and has a lot of places you can take pictures at.
2738,5.0,The palace was huge and it took us more than 1 hour to cover all areas. We took the free guide to take us around the palace and it was useful as we were able to discover more than just seeing the areas inside the palace.
2739,5.0,Do this activity on a day you are feeling energetic because this place is huge! Avoid on the weekends because there are many protesters in the nearby area on Sat/Sun. Wear a Hanbok to get some stunning photos! There are tons of local shops nearby!
2740,4.0,"We loved walking around the palace when the cherry blossoms were just coming out, it’s worth getting a free map and planning your walk to visit each of the amazing buildings. My only disappointment was that a number of the buildings were undergoing renovation and access was prohibited."
2741,5.0,The grounds were very beautiful and peaceful. There are lots of places to take pictures. You must really time your visit around the changing of the guards ceremony. In addition go to the neighboring shops where you can rent traditional outfits for the hour or time duration of your choice. It really adds a special feel when you are wearing the traditional clothing and visiting the palace grounds.
2742,4.0,"we visited the palace on a sunny day. it's inportan6to have explanations from a guide, so j recommend a guided tour. don't miss the change of guards ceremony. twice a day. check.well tines because the official site is not always accurate. the screening is very colorful and beautiful. the tourif palace is also extreme nice enjoy"
2743,5.0,"What a beautiful place , right in the middle of the city  Could spend a few hours there +museum if the weather is nice . The area is walkable also if you want to explore after spending time at the palace"
2744,3.0,"Near the entrance to the left, there is a small house offering free guard costumes for tourists and guests. They have schedules posted on what time they open so better take note of the time. The catch is you can only wear it and get to take a picture just nearby the house, you cannot go far and roam around. So when you have the chance, take all the pictures you can get with your group of friends and do all the poses you can make."
2745,4.0,"Loved walking around the Palace and grounds. I opted to do a self guided tour for free and glad I did. I passed by many guided/paid tours and though you do learn a little more than reading the signage posted, I do not feel I missed anything and was able to spend more time where I wanted and move on quickly when the lines were long and slow.  There are many young girls and boys in period clothing which was fun to see and capture in pictures. Seems to be the thing to do for the young!"
2746,3.0,"Admission ticket is 3000 won, palace closed at 6pm, and last admission is at 5pm. A very huge compound, lotsa walking but nothing much to see except if its sakura else you see many people taking photos, young couples strolling (and more photos taking). Basically this is a paid admission to walk around the big compound. There is of course guards changing performance else I can't convince myself what else to see. The museum across is another different story."
2747,4.0,I went on a Saturday morning around 11 am so I could see the change of the guard act. It is ok but nothing that you will feel disappointed if you miss it. The palace is huge and interesting. Some of the pavilions were closed for repairing. There were a lot of tourists and some of them hired Korean traditional customs. Be ready to have lots of girls dressed up in Korean traditional dresses spending ages in different parts of the palace taking pictures. They are an absolute nightmare. They take and retake pictures and selfies for hours. I felt that there should be some information about the different buildings and their function.
2748,4.0,Don't miss this place If you're interested about history of Korean culture. This palace where you can see the king was living during the ancient centuries.
2749,5.0,"Lovely palace, and best appreciated if you join the free tour. You can also rent a hanbok in nearby shops -- I believe you get free admission if you do."
2750,4.0,"Firstly, this is one place to catch the glance, understand the culture. Most cetainly, this is a must for vising Corea/Seoul."
2751,5.0,"We went on a free Seoul airport tour to see this palace and did not get to see everything. It is a massive place where one should set aside a few hours to explore. We also went in the winter, when it was cold. I imagine in the summer it's a lot better. With that said, I really enjoyed walking and taking pictures of the various buildings. There wasn't too many places to go inside, but one could look into some of the main buildings, such as the throne room of the king.  This is pretty much a ""must see"" if you are going to Seoul and it is located right near the center of the city, so there's no excuse to miss it unless such things bore you."
2752,4.0,"Fee entrance with Hanbok attire. A lot of Hanbok rental shop Nearby. 2 hours of rental cost from KRW10,000 is sufficient for us to take photo and walk around."
2753,5.0,"Must see. One of the main attractions in the city. The area is huge. So make sure you have enough time. Traditional costumes are available, so you can dress up and take nice pics. The main event that takes place there several times a day is the changing of the guard. It’s a good show, very colorful. Make sure you check the schedule, all the guidebooks have it. Don’t miss it. And there is a fantastic museum nearby - the Folk Museum. Highly recommended as well."
2754,5.0,"I spend almost 2 hours here, so many beautiful places here, and it's huge. you should come in spring and autumn. I think it will be a great picture to take. Don't forget to rent Hanbok (Korean traditional dress)"
2755,5.0,"You must to visit the Gyeongbokgung Palace one you landed here in Seoul, i guarantee you'd be amaze. Traditional cultural building in the middle of metropolitan city and yet it's blend very well. One thing that you should watch is the Guard Exchange Ceremony."
2756,5.0,The palace is amazing need to visit .. am not history fan guy .. but the place is big and you can take long walk and see the palace and have great pic
2757,4.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty and was definitely a must-visit on our Seoul bucket list.. Built in 1395, it is located in northern part of Seoul and with that said, it was a rather gobsmacking experience to observe how much Seoul has modernised over the years just by standing at the entrance of the palace. The colours, design and interior of the palace was remarkable and well-preserved over the years.  I visited the place at 1pm, just in time for their change-of-guard ceremony which lasted for about 10 minutes. It was an interesting performance to witness and thank goodness for perfect timing. Expect a lot of tourists dressed up in hanboks (traditional Korean garments) lining up to take a photo with the palace guards or posing everywhere along the palace grounds (and I mean it, EVERY WHERE). I visited the palace on a Tuesday (mind you it was a non-holiday season) and it was packed. I can't imagine what it would be like on a weekend!  There are free tours of the palace grounds in English but I did not follow the crowd as I started getting annoyed at the number of tourists mindlessly carrying their selfie sticks and swinging them around everywhere. It was just me though, I dislike crowded places and flocks of tourists. Worth a visit, nevertheless!"
2758,3.0,"Nice place for tourists, especially the changing of guards, it will be more meaningful when you are able to see it. If I'm not mistaken its 2pm."
2759,5.0,"We made the mistake of going in a Tuesday, but was still able to see the surroundings and go to the museum, which was also free."
2760,5.0,This is the largest and most impressing of the royal palaces in Seoul Not to be missed After visit this Palace there are interesting neighborhoods and markets near by also museums so you can plan a full day of. Sightseeing in this area before heading to the famous shopping and street food areas
2761,5.0,"If you are visiting Seoul, Gyeongbokgung Palaca is a MUST! You can only see the gardens with a guided tour, which you can arrange inside (many languages available)."
2762,5.0,Nice view of the palaces and picturesque place to go around. Enjoyed my sightseeing! Some areas are under restoration and renovations. Place is quite huge but feast for the eyes!
2763,5.0,"We got there a bit late, couldn’t go through the gate anymore. But it was probably better to watch it at the front of the palace, later they let us in, we still saw the band, the marching columns, Colorful/ beautiful costumes . It lasted about an half hour. In the end we got to take pictures with generals and soldiers . Was fun."
2764,5.0,"This was our first place to visit after our breakfast at the hotel.It was winter that time but the sun is out .The place was huge and while we were walking,our guide was telling us the story of the Palace.I recommend to visit this place first hour during your visit in seoul because you can no longer take the pictures you like if there are many people already."
2765,3.0,"I walked the whole palace. I was giving high hope to review the history and how the emperor or ancient Korean lived. However, it seems like no one comment this is a REBUILD of everything!!!! You can still be amazing by the size and the building structure. However, beside the main palace all other places are empty..... A bit disappointed because I like to understand the Korean culture more. Still you can see the Korean government's effort to rebuild the palace and allow tourists understand their past."
2766,4.0,"It’s a very scenic palace and it’s a must go place for tourist whom visit Seoul. But unfortunately for us that coming to Seoul on Seollal Day, the palace closed early than it supposed to so it is very disappointing as we are unable to go in even though it still early. It stated that the palace closed at 4.30pm due to the Public Holiday as we already reached there at 4.20pm, they are not allowing us to get in. So it is really saddening me cause it is my dream place to visit. What we can only do is taking a picture outside the palace."
2767,5.0,The palace is an interesting area to visit. Plenty of information to learn about how the king and queen lived before capitalism ruled over. The ritual of changing of guards at 10am Seoul time in the vicinity of the palace is not to be missed.
2768,5.0,"I paid a visit with my couple just a few days before she went back to her Homeland, and we had an amazing time. First of all, ""Nightseeing"". During summer, they also open during night time, and usually foreigners had special price (which is more expensive) in any country; in the palace, foreigners have an opportunity to get a different personal daily quota (Some Koreans may not have a place... but we got it). Moreover, they held presentations, special lighting and a very unique opportunity to see Seoul and Korea's history in a whole different way."
2769,4.0,This is probably the main palace most tour guides and groups take tourists to. That being said it is crowded if you go at the wrong time. Admission is free if you wear a hanbok(korean traditional wear). Once you stray a bit from the main entrance it does quiet down but be prepared for crowds on days with nice weather. There are sometimes protests going on in the surrounding area outside the main gates.
2770,5.0,It is a must to visit this beautiful palace and watch the Changing Guard Ceremony... It has a beautiful place to give us imagination about what happened in the Korean Dynasty long long time ago...
2771,5.0,"Seeing Gyeongbokgung Palace is on the A list for tours, but beyond the history and the culture, the thing that I enjoyed most was watching Koreans take pictures in their traditional clothing, Hanbok. This is a serious activity for Koreans, especially for the young in love, engaged or recently married. There are ""required"" photo ops and it was fun watching the ""romantics"" cue up for traditional photo spots. I offered to take photos for several groups so that everyone could get into the picture and they allowed me to take their picture as well. Some even invited me to pose with them and shot a picture for me on my camera! Note: If you wear a hanbok, then admittance is free to the Palace. Over 65 are also free. I also shot pictures of all the Haechi statues at the palace. The Haechi (a picture of which is on almost every Seoul taxi) is a mythical lion-like horned creature that often appears in myths as a guardian against fire and disasters. A large Haechi statue stands on guard in front of Gyeongbokgung Palace, protecting the nation. Also, there is a nice place to have a tea or other beverage and small pastry."
2772,3.0,"The place is very BIG and clean, but historical naration to the tourist is not sufficient. Only some area has a naration."
2773,5.0,Visiting this palace makes you feel you're in a Korean historical drama while wearing Hanbok which is free entrance when you wear it. The place is very big and many spot for instagram photos. One of the best is the lake view.
2774,5.0,We had fun inside the palace. We rented Korean costume and had lots of fun photos. The best one in the one in the lake. It was postcard quality photos. Highly recommend to come and visit this place when you are in Korea.
2775,4.0,"I have been to Gyeongbokgung Palace for more than 5 times and all are different season. Those most I like is during Autumn. The lake is so beautiful. Many people visited this palace dressing Hanbok, its make the place looks like very historical. I love the architecture of the palace. Its so classic and beautiful. The information about the palace is very clear. The ambience is so nice and relaxing."
2776,5.0,Architecture was great and we arrived just in time for the changing of guard ceremony. Good place to visit.
2777,5.0,This palace reminded me so much of the Forbidden City of Beijing except Gyeongbokgung had way more signs explaining the historical context. It's definitely worth a visit!
2778,3.0,"It is hard to be impress by the palace if you have been to China. Those are bigger, more grand and more historically significant than the ones in Seoul. There is a lot of empty spaces with just sands and normal trees. Very little historical information are given and the whole place just feel souless. Better off to visit the national museum nearby. You can also see many people dressed in Korean hanbok but I find it gimmicky, you do received free entrance if you do that as well. It is one of those places you go so you can said I been there."
2779,5.0,"Biggest and in my opinion best palace in Seoul. Great for photo sessions because you can always find some good spots without any people. Also, service is available in English, Korean, Japanese and Chinese so no problem with sightseeing. I've already gone there like 20 times and gonna back anytime"
2780,5.0,"One of the must visit places in Seoul. It's a big palace complex where you can not only enjoy traditional architecture but sometimes also performances, such as guard changing ceremony. I've visited this place many times and I definitely recommend to go there dressed in Hanbok. Not only you can enter for free but also the whole experience gets better!"
2781,4.0,"Time this for the changing of the guard. Well worth it for the photo ops. The palace is definitely worthwhile and they are working to get ramps everywhere. So if you are a little disabled it’s ok. The national costume rental, allows the wearer to enter for free. Hint; remember to get a guide book at another counter."
2782,4.0,"A beautiful place with historic building, if you really like the history things, this place will be the best choice when you visit Seoul. There is a lot of Han-bok renting store near the palace. You can book the traditional hanbok online, then go there change cloth. Go into the palace will be ticket-free with hanbok costume."
2783,5.0,"It was my first encounter with this kind of architecture and I was thoroughly impressed. I lost my bonnet while I was walking the grounds and lost&found wasn’t very helpful, but it didn’t dim my wonder with the place. You can walk around the buildings at your own pace, and if you are wearing the national custom, entrance is free (you will see dressed up girls everywhere, another delight!). Not that it’s expensive otherwise - I think it’s about 2 or 3 US dollars. I wasn’t there in time for the free tours and I feel I would have loved it even more if I had taken one; for someone who knows very little about Seoul or even Korea, most of the context is lost. In any case, it was a wonderful way to pass the time (stayed there about one hour and a half) and I would come back any time :)"
2784,5.0,"Interesting palace, can get crowded at the times for the. Hanging of the guard, but worth it. Recommended"
2785,5.0,The whole area around this is simply astonishing. Good thing - we got a perfect day with blue sky. Lots of people borrowed local costumes which gave the place a lot of flair.
2786,3.0,"I was pretty excited to visit this palace actually. We reached there early in the morning by subway. Once there, people are gathering to watch changing guard ceremony. I thought it's gonna be awesome but it was just average and nothing special about it. We purchased tickets and was asked if I wanted to purchase entrance tickets for all palace. We purchased tickets for Gyeongbokgung Palace only and was glad we did not purchase ticket for all. Nothing much to see inside, not too big or too small. All building are closed. Even if it's open, there's nothing much to see. Nice place to take pictures though. There's a exit gate in the middle of the palace. Exit that way and turn left. You may walk to Bukchon Hanok Village which is just around the corner. 10 minutes walk is required."
2787,4.0,"Very wide palace, wore hanbok when we entered and we availed a free entrance. Be early to get a nice photos"
2788,4.0,"For first timers to Seoul, this palace is good to put on the itinerary. Rent a hanbok at the numerous rental places and get free entry into this historical venue where kings and queens reined.  Catch the changing of guard ceremony while you are there."
2789,4.0,Just as we arrived they performed the changing of the guard which was very impressive. The grounds are beautiful and it is relaxing if you just want to sit on a bench and enjoy the scenery.
2790,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the five palaces in Seoul area. This is the main palace of the Joseon Dynasty. Although the palace was restored after suffering damages in 1592 and during the Japanese occupation, the palace was restored beautifully by the Koreans. The palace ground is vast and houses many buildings and halls, all having their own use and purpose.  We made use of the free guided tour in English, provided by the Palace Management Office. The guided tour explains in detail the purpose and history behind each building in the palace. After the guided tour, we had a much better understanding of Korean history.  We also managed to catch the Changing of Palace Guard Ceremony. The ceremony was a reenactment based on historical documents and records.  For seniors(over 65 y/o), admission is free (make sure you bring your passport). Would recommend a visit if you are interested in history and ancient architecture. If we had more time in Seoul, we would like to visit few more of the other four palaces."
2791,4.0,"A palace to remember,you can see,experience and learn something new about history.. if you're a history lover especially to those cultures of different countries,then hooray and come.. for sure you'll love this place.. if you're wearing a hanbuk (cultural dress) then your entrance fee is 100%free,(no need to buy ticket for the entrance )"
2792,5.0,"We had a day in Seoul. This large Palace and all the historical information was enough to keep us busy for the the day. We watched the changing of guard, saw lots the architecture, and experience and learnt some of the South Korea’s culture ."
2793,4.0,one of the palaces in the middle of the seoul. Near to gwanghwamun square and choenggyechon stream. the most visited palace among others.
2794,5.0,The scenery was fantastic because of the snow that came down a few days ago. Was very impressive.
2795,5.0,"Gorgeous buildings and grounds facing downtown Seoul. Temples, pavilions, shrines, and ponds. Plan at least a couple of hours"
2796,5.0,"Had a great afternoon there, would recommend it on a sunny day for nice photos. Do rent the hanbok for a perfect photo and check out the restaurants nearby."
2797,5.0,"My mom loves korean movies. Specially old historical movies. It felt i was walking in one of their scenes. Interesting palace. I wish i was there in spring time, i am sure with all the trees and flowers would have looked marvelous"
2798,5.0,"Even if you spend only a few minutes here, Gyeongbokgung Palace is a beautiful and important part of Korean history. The main palace is a stunning example of Korean architecture and it is a great place to sightsee with all the visitors in traditional Korean dress."
2799,5.0,"Spent the afternoon at Gyeongbokgung Palace, the National Palace of Korea. We were totally amused watching the guard's antics before and after we entered! It is a huge site with many areas under restoration. The grounds were beautiful and an array of stunning autumn colours set the scene. Many young women/men (and older) in full traditional dress, it was so special to see. A huge site, it was also home to the Korean Fok Museum and Korean Nationa Palace Museum. We spent an afternoon here, but if you want to visit the Museums it could almost be a full day visit. At one gate we were able to go out and see The Blue House which is the executive office and official residence of the South Korean head of state, the President of the Republic of Korea."
2800,3.0,"Walking distance from our hotel, we visited the palace in the morning where there is not much people yet around. Good for taking photos and nice to see Korean architecture. You have to see the changing of guards that takes place at certain hours of the day. You can also rent traditional Korean attire at a few places around the palace to capture awesome memorable pictures."
2801,4.0,We visited the site during the New Year weekend so it was full of visitors wearing their own or rented Hanbok traditional clothing. The atmosphere was very festive with people all dressed up sitting on the steps of the various structures taking photographs. Be sure to look up and enjoy the painted colors of the buildings. There is a brief changing of the guard with drums and flags and guards in colorful period uniforms. The adjacent museum had an english audio guide to assist you through the exhibits
2802,4.0,Excellent for tourist who wants to experience the history and culture of korea. I recommend it for nature-loving and people who don't mind walking and listening to lectures. there is a guided tour that are very informative and the place is relaxing.
2803,5.0,"My friend and I rushed to Gyeongbokgung Palace to witness the Changing of Guard Ceremony, we were awed with performance despite of the cold weather. Afterwards, we rushed to the nearby store to rent a hanbok-traditional Korean dress. It was a bit expensive but it was worth it. If you visit this place wearing a hanbok, entrance fee is waived. The palace is a beauty to behold. This is the biggest palace among the 5 palaces of Seoul, South Korea. This is the living witness of the history of Korea. The palace offers breathtaking views, perfect for pictorial. If you are a heritage lover, then this place is a must see. Aside from the palace itself, you can witness the changing of guard ceremony observed every morning and visit the National Palace Museum and National Folk Museum within the compound for free. It was lovely experience, it was a dream come true!!"
2804,4.0,Best palace in Seoul. Really beautiful. The entrance is 3000w. Worth the visit and there are no queues.
2805,5.0,I recommend taking the combo tickets and doing all the palaces in 1 or 2 days it is worth the 10.000 won. Gyeongbukgung is the biggest palace and the most impressive one ^^ enjoy the history of thr joseon dynasty and the museum next to it :)  but the palace Doeksugung that l lesser known and down from gyeongbukgung is worth a visit after sundown !!! Only palace that is open and lighted up at night ^^ it is impressive and so pretty !
2806,5.0,"Beautiful, surrounded by water a classic Asian structure made of carved colourful wood and fine ceiling design and typical old Asian roof tile style. Asian classic."
2807,5.0,"This is the main palace in Seoul, South Korea, from the Joseon period built in 1395. Also known as the Northern palace, v/s the Eastern and Western palaces. The largest and most beautiful one. The National Palace Museum and the National Folk Museum are nearby just outside of the respective gates. Well worth a visit, if one has to understand the history of Korea."
2808,5.0,"The palace is set against the impressive backdrop of Bugaksan Mountain and the grounds offer a great insight into the power and majesty of the Joseon royal court, the most long-lasting dynasty in Korean history.  There are English brochures at the ticket stand to aid foreign visitors. I believe there are also guided tours, but we chose the self-guided option and used our brochures to walk the grounds and explore the sprawling compound.  Also on-site and free to enter: the Korean National Folk Museum and Korean National Palace Museum."
2809,5.0,"It was zero degrees celsius when we visited but we just had to dress up in hanbok. I think doing so made it more special. It was unbelievably cold but it still fun. I opted not to get dressed in kimono when I visited Japan, this experience makes me want to go back and try the kimono."
2810,4.0,"The Royal Palace is a must-see attraction if you want to appreciate the life style in the old Korean kingdom. The actual palace is rather large, with a lot of empty spaces. The actual living quarter for the residences are very small. There are simple buildings with several rooms and courtyards. In comparison, I found this Palace more formal than the Japanese. The design is similar the one in Beijing; but in a much much smaller scale."
2811,5.0,This place is really huge and I was amazed by the structures being preserved up to this time. Witness the changing of guards and a lot at least 1-2hrs when visiting. This is a must visit place in Seoul!! This is totally worth it.
2812,5.0,"I absolutely recommend you to join the free guided groups (every 1-2 h). As well, I went in a morning of a workday, so no pretty crowded. You can also buy Palace Pass (10 000 W) for 4 palaces, which makes sense as the ticket here is 3 000 W for all (no student discount). My advice: eat well before going, no shops on the territory, and take comfortable shoes and warm clothes as you will be walking 2-3 hours."
2813,5.0,Wonderful palace showcasing the beauty of simplicity of Korean royal architecture. Visit early in the morning before it gets too crowded. Change of guards at 10am and 2pm worth to watch. Lose yourself among the various pavilions and do not miss the wooden palace at the top north of the estate.
2814,5.0,"I've been to this palace twice now, once in winter and the other in June and both times were so much fun. Attend the free tours and take your time walking around the grounds. Rent a hannok too!"
2815,3.0,"While it’s sort of pretty with what there is, the palace grounds are really small and doesn’t really have much grandiosity to it. If compared to the forbidden palace, it pales greatly in comparison. Most (if not all) of the palace is reconstructed from a fire before being abandoned for a few centuries, so it doesn’t look or feel how an ancient structure would typically be. At the end of the palace, beyond it, there are some weird prison like structures that absolutely destroys the beauty of the mountain as a backdrop to the palace. Entry fee isn’t expensive though, at US$3, so it’s worth a visit if you’re exploring the area. Not really worth a detour."
2816,5.0,No regrets of making a stop at the Gyeongbokgung Palace. This place is huge and has a lot of history.  You can spend an easy 2 hours strolling around and for those who love photography- this is a great place to take pictures.
2817,5.0,"The entrance fee is only about 3,000 won but free on holidays, and it is excellent! There are free tours in English, and you can walk the grounds with a group or wander free. It's a beautiful palace and at the center of Seoul. Highly recommend!"
2818,5.0,Gyeongbokgung is a beautiful historical place. The most beautiful thing is that everyone can rent a traditional dress and visit it!
2819,5.0,"We enjoyed the experience here. Be aware it is closed on Tuesdays (we found out the hard way) Do be sure to go when they have the mock changing of the guard I believe there is a morning show around 11am and another at 2pm. It is very well maintained with signs in Korean, English, and I believe Chinese also. I recommend allowing at least 1 1/2 hours as it is expansive. You can rent traditional Korean outfits from several places around the palace if you want to do that as well."
2820,4.0,"We visited the Gyeongbokgung Palace while we were in South Korea for the Olympics. It allowed us to soak in the long standing history of the country in a very modern and busy downtown city like Seoul. First thing we noticed without much research into the palace was the size and scope of the area. We initially entered the palace thinking it would be a good hour of exploration, but if you want to take in everything the site has to offer that would likely require 4-6 hours. By the time we left, I clocked about 3.5 miles of walking.  The buildings are magnificent. Most are recently built because they have been destroyed so many times over the past 800 years so you won’t be looking at historic monuments per se, but you get the grand scope of the palace as you venture around. We happened to visit right at the end of the four day Korean National holiday so there were a lot of South Koreans taking very traditional pictures with the cultural clothing rented from local shops. We found that extremely interesting and actually allowed us some great pictures of the palace buildings with amazingly garbed locals.  The one thing that I would say is definitely take your pictures, but at a certain point the buildings look very similar and the photographs kind of meld together. Therefore don’t be afraid to put the phone/camera down and just experience the history in front of you. The buildings will look too similar in pictures but you will still be in awe of the surroundings that only your eyes will be able to soak in.  The winter is very cold and the plant life is all in hibernation. I would love to see what the palace looks like in the spring in full bloom but all in all it was a great visit."
2821,5.0,"it is near the Anguk station on the brown line, few hundred meters away! Pro-tip go on a weekend cause it is usually free that time and go early so that you could still take your photos in peace away from thousands of tourists."
2822,5.0,"We able to see the changing of guards it was really a nice experience, it was just too cold for me to wear hanbok but it was really nice having picture in the palance wearing hanbok;) the palace is nicely keept, and clean even comforts rooms;)"
2823,4.0,"Well worth a visit!! Lots to see, I could easily spend a full day here! Its often very busy, and there were many school trips on the day that we went. Lots of people were dressed in traditional outfits and ealking around taking pictures too. Worth bearing in mind that it can be a little difficult at times with a stroller. There are ramps up and down most steps but the ground is uneven and rocky in places. My friend was ok wkth her stroller as it had big and solid wheels!"
2824,5.0,"A beautifully restored palace, several lovely temples and some well-kept grounds are the highlights of a visit to Gyeongbokgung. Plan on spending an hour or so wandering through the site and immersing yourself in the 500 year plus history of the Joseon Dynasty.  Ps - time your visit to make sure you experience the changing of the guard. It happens several times per day and is worth seeing."
2825,5.0,"a big palace from the past, must visit spot if you come to seoul. many photo spot inside. a famous tourist spot but not so crowded. try to visit it in 4 different season, you'll find a different feelings."
2826,5.0,"This is an amazing palace and grounds - and way bigger than expected from the outside. You can get some great photos of the spectacular architecture against the cityscape, as well as the visitors in traditional Hanbok dress.  I arrived just before the changing of the guard at 2 pm, which you shouldn’t miss. It’s quite a show, with military pomp, drums and uniforms. Kids would probably love it.  I took a free Seoul Walking Tour around the palace, which is a great option to get the most out of the experience. There is a lot of history that one might not get without a guide."
2827,5.0,"We were visiting 2018 Olympic Games and stopped fro few days in Seoul. Visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace was highlight of our visit, watching changes of guards, visiting different parts of palace was awesome. Korean history is reach, interesting and memorable."
2828,5.0,Really enjoyed the walk in the palace ground with my sons. As a fan of Korean movies n dramas it feel surreal to walk around this beautiful place.
2829,5.0,"Well preserved. Full of history. They even offer free tours (chinese, english, korean etc) inside the palace. The people wearing hanbok makes the palace alive."
2830,5.0,To enhance your Korea experience. It is recommended to wear their traditional costume they call Hanbok. It’s amazing to stroll around this well preserve palace. Last time June 2017 the pavilion was renovated but the rest of the area is still accessible.
2831,5.0,Me and my friends rented a hanbok so we can enter for free also the scenery feels like you're in a different world like those you watch in korean dramas its really an amazing experience .
2832,5.0,Lovely area with very reasonable price entrance prices' easy to navigate even for persons that have difficulties to walk' the photo ops all around are unique nor too be missed' and the place is able to maintain its beauty even with thousands of tourist inside its ground because of its sheer size'
2833,4.0,"You can dress up in hanbok (especially the costumes for king / queen, etc). Lot of photo opp, but not really much to look at. Vast space and not really much inside. It's interesting how international Korea has become.. lots of tourists from all over."
2834,5.0,"This place is one of the many reasons why many people visit Seoul. The old architectural surrounded by the most technology building makes most unique combinations. It makes you almost feel the revolutionary.  The palace itself contains many historical secret which we can only guess through the presence. Not to mention the “rental hanbok” nearby which you can turn yourself into a historical as well.  People visit here all year round, even in the winter. Don’t worry about the subway line, it’s everywhere and it’s pretty easy to get there cheaply. It’s 2 in 1 because there’s also a museum.  Very recommend!"
2835,4.0,"You can reach this palace by using the subway train, the Gyeongbokgung station. Once you arrived, it is recommended to rent a Hanbok dress, because your picture will look more classic. Haha. You can walk about 300 meters to the left of this palace entrance to go to the Hanbok rental shop. This palace was a nice place to take a lot of pictures."
2836,4.0,"It's a great cheap little thing you can do for an hour or two. I think it was 3,000 Won or something like that. Very well preserved and very beautiful, but unless you time your visit right with the tour or any shows, it's hard to stay entertained for so long. The museum next door is fantastic, though. All in all, if you're visiting Seoul it's definitely a place to see."
2837,5.0,"It's definitely not as big as the Forbidden Palace in Beijing; however, it's still worth a visit. The layout is similar with gates and buildings where the Royalties would enjoy entertainment, and such. It's great to see the urban city behind the Palace and admission included a visit to the Folk Museum, which was worth a stopover to see their exhibitions. Great place to take photos if you decide to borrow and wear a hanbok."
2838,5.0,"Just like Changdeokgung Palace, Gyeongbokgung Palace is grand, beautiful and peaceful. Well preserved. You can also catch the changing of the guard if you time your visit right. Worth a visit."
2839,5.0,"Start pestering the guards on duty. Their traditional silk garbs are photogenic.  The palace grounds are beautiful. This time, it snowed. It was beautiful.  A must do in Seoul."
2840,4.0,"We came here during Feb when the Olympics were in South Korea. We came here on our first morning. It was a cool look around, and the guard ceremony was worth watching."
2841,5.0,"Was the first royal palace built in the Joseon Dynasty. Is the largets of the 5 palaces remaining in Seoul. You have to pay around 3,000 Wons per Adult and foreigners under 18 years old can enter for free. This palace is close on Tuesdays. Changing of the Royal Guard Ceremony twice daily. Is a beautiful and incredible place to visit, the colors are incredible you can learn a lot of this beautiful culture and country. Every time i go to seoul i love to visit it."
2842,4.0,"Went to visit the Palace in February on a very cold (-15C) and windy day. It's a beautiful place that can easily transport you back to the past, especially if you have many people wearing the traditional costumes. Followed the free English tour and that made the place more interesting. What's left is 10% of the original palace and it's also been rebuilt. Recommended to visit this palace to get a feel of the past vs the modern Korea."
2843,4.0,"If you like to take pictures then you visit this palace as you can wear traditional dress then you enter every where free, their is show (guard changing shift) last move 14:00 🕑 and if u need English guide u can find after 13:30 🕜"
2844,4.0,The grounds and gardens of the palace are interesting to walk through especially when it’s not busy as you feel transported back to a different age. It’s a relatively cheap attraction to go to ( ₩4000) which includes the main palace and the gardens. Aldo it’s easily accessible by metro.
2845,4.0,Covered in snow when I went in late January. Nice architecture with a good bit of history. Beautiful in winter.
2846,3.0,History and culture tour. Beautiful place for picture taking and dress up in Korean traditional costume.
2847,5.0,"Great experience to visit this lovely Palace in the winter. With temperatures between -10 and -15 degrees C we did a tour to the Secret Garden and found it interesting, beautiful and freezing. Jay, our guide, did and excellent job in explaining the ways of the people in the earlier years. I would highly recommend this tour with all its well maintained structures."
2848,5.0,"I suggest you take the guided tour of the grounds to get the real feel of what transpired so many years ago. Take note of the detail that went into the buildings centuries ago. The guards are like they were when the Palace was lived in, I don't even think they blink"
2849,4.0,I went to Gyeongbokgung in 2014 with my friends and in 2017. This place is a place I always back to. They have a ceremony every certain hours and I am lucky to always witness it whenever I come.
2850,5.0,Make sure your rent the hanbok costumes from the shops outside the palace before visiting there. Dont miss the Changing Guards event.
2851,4.0,If you lke to visit palaces. It was a great palace to visit. Obe of the most visited palace in Seoul.
2852,5.0,"this places is so beautiful, i was there when in winter season. i feel freeze of course, but i feel so comfort here so many places to taken a photos. I’m happy being here"
2853,5.0,"best location to take photos, every corner were good for taking photos. this grand palace was well taken care of."
2854,5.0,Our tour guide Harry shared the every detail of the historical background of this palace. The architectural structure is truly amazing because every detail has its own meaning.
2855,5.0,"This palace is one of our favorite place. We visited this place around 03.00 p.m, which is a warmer time in winter. We only had 2 hours to look around. The children felt amazed seeing Gyeonghoeru Pavilion and the frozen lake. It was very beautiful.  There were a folk museum and children's folk museum inside this palace. We suggest you to visit those museums."
2856,5.0,"This place is a korea historic place. Nice place to walk around and enjoy the scenery, there are museums too inside the palace area. You can join free english/korea tour managed by the gyeongbokgung staff. Try to find a good spot far inside to get good photos."
2857,3.0,"While it is beautiful, it is also extremely expansive. I didn't join and tour and perhaps I should have because about an hour into the palace I was turned around wandering through different alleys. It was really hot that day and there really isn't any refereshment options inside so after a few hours of looking around, I did feel a little like a rat trapped in a maze.  Worth going but wear really good shoes and bring plenty of water."
2858,4.0,"This place was gorgeous. The color and detail in the pillars and palace were exquisite. It was super cold when we got here as snow was everywhere. However we were delighted to see the Kingsguard ceremony was EPICCCC. Loved the way they dressed up in ceremonial clothing from back then as well as the moustaches too. The band was stellar and loved all the pretty colors. The gong player was awesome too. Lots of walking required and I didnt have the energy to walk everywhere.  There is a cafe where you can purchase a hot chocolate which we did right away. A few girls came dressed in Hanboks and they looked incredible. Probably something we should have done as we dressed in them after, but way too cold at the time. Best time to go is at 9AM as NO one is there, makes for taking better photos."
2859,5.0,Visiting this palace was such an unique and special experience! My daughter and I had a great time while we were there.
2860,5.0,This place is huge! My feet got tired just walking around this place and didnt have the energy to go to another palace. There are shops nearby where you can rent hanbok so better to rentone before going around to take photos :)
2861,4.0,"Went to this Gyeongbokgung Palace, but too many people and couldnt find any clear instruction on the usage of the traditional costume. But still, this palace is attractive!"
2862,5.0,"One of the many Palaces than can be seen in South Korea. It is a long walk but a lot to see. It is better appreciated if you have a Tour Guide to understand the importance and history of every architectures inside this huge Palace. There's no entrance fee. If you're a kdrama fan, you might remember some historical period dramas that depicts the Korean's Joseon dynasty. Another attraction is the changing of royal guards ceremony located in one of the gates (Gwanghwamun gate). You can see a lot of tourists and locals wearing traditional clothing (Hanbok) and you can wear one too (but with a corresponding fee) to add to the vibe. It is so crowded when we visited-an hour before noon."
2863,5.0,Huge palace with lots of tourists. Make sure you check out the changing of guard times. Beautiful autumn atmosphere but had few restoration works while we were there.
2864,5.0,"A nice place to spend an hour or two wandering the grounds. Walking tours in multiple languages are conducted every 2-3 hours or so. There is lots of history to be learned here, and many beautiful photo opportunities!"
2865,4.0,"This palace is the biggest among the other 5 palaces in Seoul. It is huge and grand and a great way to spend a relaxing morning. The palace buildings are beautifully restored and its granduer really impressed me. You can easily spend 4 hours just looking at every nook and cranny. Do allocate some time to watch the changing of guards at the main Gwanghwamun gate. Do not rush through this attraction as you sit down at the many seats provided to just watch the relaxing scenery. National Folk Museum of Korea is also situated in the Palace's ground. I was able to enter the museum FOC with the Palace ticket. With such a big ground to cover and a museum to visit, do wear comfortable walking shoes, bring drinking water and your camera. I believe you will enjoy your visit as much as I did."
2866,4.0,"One of the main palaces of Seoul, the grounds are huge while the palace itself is beautiful. Expect large crowds especially during the guard change ceremony."
2867,5.0,Excellent must-visit place especially for first timers in Seoul. Helps if you have a Guide - learn much more Korea’s history.
2868,4.0,This place is amazing and is a good place for us to understand on Korea culture. Wearing hanbok is free entrance! It was a great experience wearing hanbok walk around and snap photo around the Gyeongbokgung Place.
2869,3.0,"this palace is still under restoration. Most buildings are not allowed to entry so you can only see outside of the building, which is a disappointment."
2870,4.0,Tho palaces have common colours and shapes it gave me a glimpse of the old setting Korean telenovela i am watching.
2871,4.0,"As I walked all palace area form east side, not front gate, this was the last thing what I saw in that territory. Around palace is big water bucket, full with fish and in that square traditional music is playing. Palace was beautiful BUT I was upset when I wanted to walk in there (it is on like a island), but it was written I needed to make a reservation to go there 24 hours before. Me as tourist, who doesn't normally plan where I will go, don't like it. And it is one of the biggest palaces, so I am mad that I was not able to see it closely while I where in Seoul."
2872,4.0,"Must visit spot! Interesting and beautiful. But better in Summer or the beginning of the autmn. Free tours provided, so it makes it even better :) In English, Chinese."
2873,5.0,Great visit. Many tourists can be seen wearing traditional Korean attire.Mountains at its back look awesome. Like Buckingham Palace guard changing ceremony this palace also offers something similar which is wonderful. available on.It was very cold but we had fun watching the changing of the guards. Walk around and get lost wondering the palace. We had a temporary expo that was worth going.
2874,5.0,Beautifully restored buildings and it's an oasis of calm in this mega city. There is so much to see.
2875,5.0,"I enjoyed our tour of this palace. The Korean tour guide is English speaking and has an excellent knowledge of the history and culture of Korea. We entered here wearing a Hanbok and our entrance is free because of it. Some tourist is taking photos with us too. The parade is a must to watch, check the schedule and wait for it. If you're visiting during summer or autumn don't forget to bring umbrella or sunscreen."
2876,5.0,"Lovely stroll around palace grounds. Great insight on the royal family's lives, the palace architecture... so much to learn."
2877,4.0,"The biggest palace in Seoul, take the morning to wander around, watch the changing of the guard ceremony, see the locals in traditional dress enjoying themselves."
2878,5.0,"i am so amazed of the korean people on how they preserved gyeongbukgung palace. it is really beautiful and a place where tourist must not fail to visit. i would like to try the costume but because of so much cold, i will just try next time."
2879,5.0,"I visited Gyeongbokgung palace with my family (kids between 7-14) and it was a lot of fun. The entry was very reasonable as it was 9,500 won for 5 tickets. The grounds are very large and plan to stay for 2 or so hours to wander around if you’re not part of a tour. Additionally the palace museum is on the west side of the grounds and is free of charge as well as the Seoul Metro exit comes directly into the palace grounds. I highly recommend to go to see the history of Korea."
2880,5.0,I entered from the Folk village entrance which caused me to miss a half of the park. Enter from the main entrance ask for the information booth set up to use their free guided tour which goes out every 1.5 hours. They will take you to all the main spots you need to go to. They also have 2 different types of the changing of the guards show. It was fantastic
2881,5.0,"Visited here during the month of September 2017. Its a must see palace if you are visiting Seoul. It's quite a big palace and will take you around 2 hrs to cover it fully. The palace has an entry fee of 3000 Korean won. There is also another ticket which cover 5 palaces and valod for a month I guess, buying that ticket will get you a good deal if you are planning to visit all palaces. Also the guards changing ceremony is the one which everyone looks forward for.As I remember it starts at 2. So be there in time to witnesses it.After the ceremony you can also get pictures clicked besides the guards. Also around the palace you will find shop's were you can rent the traditional Korean attire and visit the palace in that attire."
2882,5.0,"We enjoyed visiting this with our tour guide- he was able to get us to the best place to view the changing of the guard, and also helping to find a close place to rent Hanbok and Joseon-era clothing for taking pictures at the Palace during changing of the guard. We usually are not the type to do cosplay but this was actually a really fun way to go around the palace grounds. If you do rent costumes, admission is free into the palace grounds. (was only able to convince one of our teenage daughters to dress up though...)"
2883,5.0,"One of the top Seoul attractions. Very vast, a lot to learn about Seoul history. Prepare to walk a lot inside."
2884,5.0,"The front yard area is nice and open, it's lovely to walk around the whole palace and see the different parts of it.  It was quite cold when I went in the hanbok but it makes for a picturesque area for sure.  It is worth a visit especially because there's so much more to see in the area."
2885,4.0,If u want to visit there search about hours about ceremony changing of security. When i was there it happened at 11 o clock. And last about 30 mins.
2886,4.0,The palace is hugeee. We forgot to take the flyers at the information counter making it hard to understand the while history behind it. U can also rent a hanbok and take picture here. We didnt do it because it was below 0 degrees when we went. I had fun admiring the architecture of the palace too.
2887,5.0,"I always visit Gyeongbukgung every time I go to Korea. This time, my friends and I decided to rent hanbok (Korean traditional attire) at Hanboknam before going to the palace for a royal entrance. We really enjoyed walking from Hanboknam to the palace because it was autumn then."
2888,4.0,A great place to visit full of history and the beautiful buildings and gardens takes you back 600 years. The guards guarding the palace gates were amazing. just stands so still.
2889,3.0,There is really not much to see there. Visitors are not allowed to enter the palaces. People just walk the halls and take photos. 3000 W entrance fee line 3 (orange line) - Gyeongbokgung St - exit 5
2890,5.0,Well maintained palace. Only 3000 won per entry! You can always buy the integrated tickets so that you can enter 3 palaces and 1 shrines with one price!
2891,4.0,In all our Asian tours we make it a point to visit temples and palaces to learn about the history and culture of the country we are visiting. Gyeongbukgung Palace being the residence of the last King in the last Korean Dynasty was a must visit for us. It was a huge place which we would not have appreciated if not for the free guided tour in English. The guides were waiting off Exit 5 of Gyeongbukgung Station and would offer visitors a free English tour. Yes...free! Our guide spoke eloquently in English and was very knowledgeable in history of the palace and explained to us intricate details of its construction to both keep the king and his family comfortable as well as protected from threats. The walking tour was about an hour. Oh don’t forget to check out the changing of the guards at the palace main entrance.
2892,4.0,"If you're visiting on a budget and not wanting to pay to enter the inner areas of the palace, then try to come by right around the changing of the guard, which happens at 10AM and then at 1PM (the morning guard change is less crowded). It's free to watch the ceremony, which takes about 10-15 minutes. You can then take a picture with the guards who stand at the front."
2893,5.0,"This past summer I took a trip to South Korea with the Korean Ties program. This was my first trip to Asia. Visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace was one of the first places we visited. I was blown away by how beautiful the buildings were and the amazing craftsmanship. This place was very clean and had lots of great sights. The space is very open with lots of area to roam and take pictures. This is a must see if you are in Seoul, South Korea."
2894,5.0,"A very nice palace that will bring you right back into the olden days era. If you wish to rent hambok,they do not offer it at the palace. You have to head to the shops outside the palace to rent it. It is very easy to find. Overall a very nice palace."
2895,3.0,"While the entrance seems packed because everyone was waiting for the changing service of the guards, the inner compound wasn't that crowded. There are a few lakes in the palace however one of it was under renovation during our visit. The compound of the palace is huge and we took our own time to take photographs. People who dress up in traditional hanbok could enter free of charge. Nice and quiet place."
2896,5.0,Very clean and spacious with minimal queue. Managed to catch e change of guards and there is english tours as well but we were ok to wander on our own amd explore. Trend to rent a traditional costume and walk around taking pics. Worth a visit and its free!
2897,4.0,"Although the palace is huge, there are actually limited opportunity to view the interior of the building. Having said that, those that we were able to, had simple open structure within the building, unlike the Chinese or Japanese palaces. Nevertheless, appreciate its culture for what it is. Watch the change of guards and join the free guided tours (check out the timing)"
2898,4.0,"Large historic palace and garden with multiple buildings, gardens, artificial lake, etc. Plan 3-4 hours to visit the place. The royal changing of the guard ceremony is held at the main gate hourly from 10:00 to 15:00 and is well worth visiting. Plan your timing so as to be at the main gate on the top of the hour either at the beginning or end or your visit. We visited on a beautiful day in the fall with some of the trees in autumn colors and a nice reflection of the Gyeonghoeru pavilion in the water. At the exit from the subway, underneath the National Palace Museum of Korea, is the modern small museum shop and good-sized café Gogungddurak where you can have a simple good meal for lunch."
2899,5.0,Amazing place and lots to see.  The guard ceremony is not to be missed at the gate followed by the free tour. Guide was knowledgeable and interacted with the group to make the hour plus walking interactive and interesting.  Station right at the front of the park makes getting there and back again easy.  There early January and was a fresh minus 4 outside plus a bit of cooling wind. Rug up with some good warm clothes for the hour or so of walking the grounds.  Well worth a few hours to go and see.
2900,4.0,"Second time coming here still beautiful as always. Amazing palaces with lots of history. The lake was under renovation though so that was a miss. In general, a must go if you come to Seoul."
2901,3.0,"A little sparse on a cold snowy day. Tour guides on hand to assist, but not a massive amount to see. Should be combined with other local museums/attractions."
2902,3.0,The palace is well preserved but i guess that's the reason why visitors are not allowed to enter. the entrance fee is cheap and you are required to join their in-house tour depending on the language of your preference.
2903,5.0,Very beautiful palaces but can require A LOT of walking. Place is suitable for families with kids. Very beautiful if you visit in Winter and Autumn.
2904,4.0,We enjoyed a free (English language) tour of the Palace and it did help explain many of the significances that merely viewing on ones own does not enable
2905,4.0,"Brought my family with a total of 7 adults and 1 toddler. The Palace was crowded and it was a great place to take pictures. If you were to visit this place during winter. Be prepared that it will be rather cold in the Palace. To get a free entry to the Palace, you can rent a Hanok during your entry to the premise. Being there, twice."
2906,5.0,"I've been here three times in three different seasons. It is stunning and informative, and I always recommend it. However, it is particularly lovely in autumn. :)"
2907,4.0,"Do plan for a full day trip if you can afford the time. It's easy to go there by subway. Plan your arrival time to catch the Guards Mounting ceremony at about 10 am. If you are early, you can watch their rehearsal too. You can consider buying their all places entrance tickets at only KRW10000. That entitles you to visit 3 other palaces/shrine.  You may spend more time in the palace tour if you like to take beautiful pictures. Plenty of nice photo locations especially if you are couples! Do have a good breakfast before going in as there's no food/ drinks available. You should not miss the free English speaking guide tour which can last about an hour plus.  Lastly, you will probably enjoy the free museum tour which is located adjacent to the palace. A good tour may take up to more than 2 hours.  Overall it's a very fulfilling educational tour for the family."
2908,5.0,"Very convenient to the hotel we were at, it was new year's day and very popular for the traditional dress since it was a culture day, which is the last weekend of every month. The only thing that sucked was the museum was closed, other than that, it was totally worth the wall. It is a bit new in some aspects, but really considering the damages to it during the war, I would hope they had repaired and repainted certain areas, it isn't a war memorial after all."
2909,5.0,"This is a special place for Koreans. During the Japanese occupation the palace was destroyed and a huge Japanese administration building was erected by the Japanese instead. I saw this some 20 years ago. Now the Japanese building which also hosted a big museum was torne down by the Koreans and the Palace reconstructed. More reconstruction is planned. Koreans are proud about their history. So the change of the guard, all in traditional clothes , is quite impressive. Many Korean women visitors show up in their traditional dresses, the Hanbok, which stems from the time of the Korean empire."
2910,5.0,The palace is the biggest palace in Seoul. A must visit while in Seoul. Make sure to check the gaurd changing ceremony at 10am.
2911,5.0,"Stunning, amazing and very accessible. Handbook rental adds to the experience. $3.00 entrance fee and $10.00 if want to dress up and pretend you are in the Joseon era."
2912,5.0,"Reminds you of the Forbidden City in Beijing, but much smaller in scale, but nice to see nevertheless. Colourful change of Guard ceremony every hour. Try to catch the English free guided tour 2 or 3 times Daily. Entry to palace is free on last Wednesday of the month."
2913,4.0,"This is mainly an outdoor experience rather than a museum and we enjoyed discovering the palace buildings and old architecture. Luckily there weren't too many tourists in December, but a couple of buildings were closed for renovation as well. We managed to enter only one building, where you had to take of your shoes to visit 2-3 rooms. Explanations in English were limited though, translations were mainly in Chinese."
2914,3.0,Nice to visit to have general view of Korea history. But nothing much to appreciate. However recommender
2915,5.0,Such an amazing tourist attraction right in the center of Seoul. An awesome place to spend the afternoon.
2916,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is a must-see while in Seoul. The changing of the guard is beautiful to watch, and walk around the grounds, which is huge. If you are 65 or older, admission is free, just bring proof (passport). Admission is inexpensive anyway ($3 USD if I remember correctly)."
2917,4.0,"If you enjoy learning or just experiencing some of the history of South Korea, then Gyeongbokgung Palace is a beautiful place to take a trip to, especially since it's not too hard to get to and reasonably priced! There's a lot of rooms and traditional buildings to see and they're all maintained well. Great location to take photos and definitely try and dress up in the hanbok if you get the chance!"
2918,5.0,It is a beautiful huge palace which has a traditional architecture. Mountains at its back look awesome. Like Buckingham Palace guard changing ceremony this palace also offers something similar which is wonderful. Many tourists can be seen wearing traditional Korean attire which is available on rent It’s a must visit attraction if you are in Korea.
2919,4.0,"It was very cold but we had fun watching the changing of the guards. And if you manage to catch that, after the ceremony, you can try on the guard costumes for free at a little hut on the left hand side after passing the entrance.  My son had fun wearing it and taking photos around the palace (near the hut).  Beautiful grounds but big! Walk further in and venture around to quieter areas where you can get lovely photographs."
2920,4.0,Great visit. The guard change is a must see. Walk around and get lost wondering the palace. We had a temporary expo that was worth going.
2921,5.0,"You'll always see this palace featured in travel blogs because it's the real deal Korean royal palace~ the biggest one, i think. There is a scheduled changing of the guards that you should not miss to have a full experience.. It's just like the royal guard changing ceremony in Buckingham Palace - but more colorful with the bright costumes of Korean officials! Very much accessible via train or bus, but get ready to walk and walk to see its beauty. The pavilion there is the one featured in the drama Rooftop Prince which made me more excited to see it. Just 3000yen for the entrance and they have hourly walking tours if you'd like to join. Also, the entrance is free if you're wearing a hanbok! Such a treat to see all the people wearing them while inside a historical place~"
2922,5.0,"A very big place, which had 7700 rooms I read, not as big as the much bigger Forbidden City in Beijing and its notional 9999 and a half rooms, but similar in impact. A sense of command to the buildings and courtyards but also tranquility"
2923,5.0,"This is the nice place to visit and we had a great memory by wearing hanbok to enter the palace. There is free admission by wearing hanbok into palace.  Unfortunately, this time missed to watch the guard changing ceremony, will back here again someday later."
2924,5.0,"I went to gyeongbokgung palace,the scenery is so pretty. Outside view is modern but when you come inside the palace is like you go to another world. Specially if you wear hanbok."
2925,3.0,"Although there are many tourist, the palace grounds are large enough for everyone to walk around in. I didn't find the palace very interesting, but i did enjoy the changing of the guards ceremony."
2926,4.0,It was a beautiful palace. A very huge compound and you'll keep walking and walking into the palace with many sub-buildings. Very unique design. Manage to watch the marching during the evening. There were huge crowd visiting the palace. It was our first stop of visit when we were in Seoul. Very convenient to walk from the subway Line 2.
2927,4.0,"Spent most of the day exploring the palace grounds, which is every large and is complemented very aptly with related, free museums.  The palace buildings are well maintained, but not over the roof ie they show signs of natural aging ie realistically illustrated  There are also free “change of guards” and free guided tours. Check the website for detailed timing.  A must go if you are on vacation in Seoul!"
2928,5.0,"Had a wonderful tour! It's my fifth visit since I came here so many years ago. It's amazing to tour solo or with a friend and all seasons, too. I recommend it to everyone. Even if a few places are being renovated, go see it. Pictures don't give it justice."
2929,5.0,"Absolutely it is legit to go there during daytime, but also you must not miss night view in the palace. For Korean, I recommend you to reserve ticket through internet! but if you are foreigners or one of your friend is a foreigner, you can buy ticket up to 4 tickets with the foreign friend! As I remember, the ticket costs around $2-3 dollars, which is not a lot At nominated time, there are some traditional musical shows in the place near to entrance, so it will be enjoyable as well! I recommend you guys to visit the palace during daytime (especially at super early morning, around opening time, which is not crowded at all!) as well as during night! However I heard that this night view is run only in specific duration! so before I visit, check it!"
2930,4.0,"We went there on our 3rd day in Seoul. The palace was very huge. There were not as many people as I would have expected since it's coming to Winter season but then you can still see lots of people there. Great place to get to know the history of South Korea. If you want to see the Guard Changing, please be there before 10.00 am as we missed it on that day. Just managed to take pic with the guards. If you plan to visit the palace & few other attractions, you might as well buy the Discover Seoul Pass. A must visit place if you just want to see one palace in Seoul ^_^"
2931,4.0,Bought as a half day tour. The changing of the guard was totally worth it. Get there early if you want the best seat. The palace is large and the foliage around the palace is gorgeous during Autumn.
2932,4.0,Have been twice - once in autumn n once in winter. Felt that the winter scene is much nicer when it comes to taking pictures. Do be careful while walking though as it can turn out to be pretty slippery.
2933,5.0,Go on Saturdays to enjoy plays at the museum inside the temples. It would be nice to have a guide to explain the history of each building.
2934,3.0,We made an appointment for a tour guide through the government tourist website. It was a free of charge. The tour started around 10:30am and ended around 12pm... There are no signs to describe what I was looking at. Most of the palace was rebuilt. There is a folk museum and a palace museum that you can visit for free. The folk museum is near the back of the palace and the palace museum is across from the ticket booth. After visiting these museums you can you use the same ticket you purchased for the palace to get back into the palace area.
2935,4.0,"..it was winter and snow just showed up when we were walking around the palace, and it was freezing cold :) ..but despite of the freezing cold weather, there were still plenty of tourists including us! Several ladies were in their Hanboks and they looked great with the snow covering the trees in the background. ...a must visit place when in Seoul 👍"
2936,5.0,Need to be PROPERLY attired for winter. Wind is bone chilling cold.  Information on the history is a little thin. Can’t really follow. Maybe it’s me.
2937,4.0,"If arriving via the subway (Gyeongbokgung station), the palace is only a short 5min stroll. The subway exit opens up next to the National Palace Museum inside the palace grounds. It is worth going to the front entrance (Gwanghwamun gate) for the Gwanghwamun plaza and statue of Admiral Yi Sun Sin. This front gate is also where the changing of the guards take place.  Back inside the palace grounds, the ticket counters are along the east side of the complex, audio guides are available for rent, recommended for more insight about the palace as there are limited signage in the palace. Apparently people wearing hanboks get a discounted price for ticket entry or possibly free.  The courtyards are well laid for an easy stroll and looked after along with manicured gardens. Unfortunately during our visit in late October , the Hwanwongjeon pavilion was closed off for renovation works.  Price of entry also includes the free entry exhibitions in the National Folk Museum (there were some exhibitions that require additional admissions). Cafe, museum shop and washroom facilities were also available here in addition to some back outside in the palace courtyards."
2938,3.0,This is a place to go to see the traditional change of guard. And lots of photos can be taken even outside the palace without paying to go in. You can rent a Traditional Customs nearby and you get to enter the palace for free.
2939,5.0,"This is a very large Palace..  If you will go here prepare to walk, walk, walk and walk.. prepare your feet, enjoy the view and take a lot of pictures"
2940,5.0,"The palace itself as been reconstructed and seems to serve as a hub for tourists though many Korean families were there --perhaps from outside the city as well as ""Seoulites"". It was interesting to see the other buildings that will be reconstructed as part of the Korean effort to reclaim their history, They are using old documents, paintings etc. as guides.  We timed our visit to see the the changing of the guards. Recommend doing this, And having a guide or really good guidebook helps better understand the importance of the palace and what went on there.  Fun place for families...Little kids we saw were loving the changing of the guards--"
2941,5.0,"Buy the combination ticket if you plan to visit the various palaces around Seoul. It will save you a few WON. Just be mindful of which dates the different locations are closed (some on Monday and some Tuesday). The site itself is lovely to walk, and you'll see dozens of young people dressed in traditional hanbok dresses and suits wandering around taking selfies."
2942,5.0,"Prepare to spend at least an hour exploring the palace grounds. On the north side of the palace, you can visit a museum as well as the Blue house."
2943,4.0,"We came here in December and not much scenery. There are students waiting for you at entrance that speaks English and Mandarin to give you tour.  They explained the various part of palace , the oven outside the building to heat up the palace, the reason for having a river to divide up the palace from town...etc.  I will not consider to come in winter since it is sluggish , dragging my feet in the snow is not comfortable at all.  Hope you find this review helpful and vote for me."
2944,4.0,"This is one of the main royal palace built in Joseon Dynasty. It’s a nice palace but because the weather was too cold (-6deg), we didn’t spent much time there. There are people who put on hanbok (traditional korean costume) and take pic in the palace. You could enter the palace FOC (normal ticket fee is KRW3,000 for adult and KRW1,500 for children), if you enter it with hanbok."
2945,4.0,"Theres not much stuff to see if you don’t like traditional scenery. For me this tour was educational and amazing to see structures with very beautiful art. You can even rent traditional palace clothing outside the vicinity. It was negative degrees when I came December this week, so during this season its very advisable to wear appropriately not to get sick. We paid i think 3000 or 4000 won for me and mt friends since they said about something being free of charge but I forgot. They have a mini show in front gate with the guards marching but mostly thats it.. your not allowed to come inside the kings office and other rooms but u can take pics by the outside. Overall it was great and crowded but surprisingly clean since I did not see trashes loitering around. Thats how the people there are disciplined."
2946,5.0,"Built in 1395, stepping into Gyeongbokgung Palace is like travelling back in time to Joseon Dynasty where you can dressed up in traditional hanok as Gongjunim or Jeonha, wondering around the palace , taking beautiful pictures against a backdrop of majestic architecture so rich in history & culture. Here's 2 considerations which may be helpful if you are travelling in the winter months: 1. Every last wed of the month is free entry. So if you are travelling end of the month, consider visiting on a wed. The palace is close on Tue anyway. 2. Consider wearing long john or thermal undergarments if you plan to dress up in hanok as it get very chilling & windy in the big palace.  The palace is very well preserved & clean. However, it is also very crowded with many tourists especially in the front, making it very hard to take pictures without being 'photobomb' by visitors. Unless you are on a 2 hour express hanok rental, otherwise, we suggest you skip the guided tour & take your time to wonder deeper into the palace to enjoy the beautiful scenery & create beautiful memories with photos."
2947,5.0,Amazing experience. Like traveling back in time. You have to watch the change of guards as well. The Palads is a must see in Seoul
2948,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is absolutely stunning, with amazing traditional Korean architecture. I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Seoul."
2949,5.0,"Among the palaces in Seoul, the stately Gyeongbokgung Palace is the undisputed ""big momma"" of them all. You can tell by the number of visitors thronging the site, with some donning the traditional hanbok to get in the mood. Tickets are 3000 won for adults and 1500 for youths below 18. The palace grounds are enormous and dotted with many many buildings to explore, and you can spend an entire day there without getting board. There is so much history here. Just tag along any of the free walking tours and you'll know why."
2950,3.0,"We were in Insadong and decided to drop in for the changing of guards ceremony at Gwanghwamun 2pm.  Arrived early at 1.30pm and managed to see the military training performance as well.  The performances were just ok. Nothing grandiose. Can watch if you happen to be in the area, but I wouldn’t travel just to see it.  (We didn’t visit the palace.)"
2951,4.0,"The biggest palace was a must visit place for our family. We went in Dec and it was so cold. We managed to catch the 2pm guard changing ceremony and it was just outside the main entrance. We went on a Mon morning and there wasn't a big crowd. Quite a number of tourists wearing hanbok walking around taking pictures, and it was sooo cold. Conected directly to the subway and very convenient. Toilet was difficult to find though, we had to ask around. The scenery was very nice and we enjoyed the palace."
2952,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung palace, the obvious seat of government in older times, is a showpiece for the city, staring down at the city's main avenue through the reconstructed Gwanghwamun gate, giving it the proper sightlines so important in eastern palace layouts. Seen from the outside from the newly built pedestrian center area of that avenue, the gate and palace grounds are nicely framed by a backdrop of green mountains. Being the main palace in Seoul, it features a number of displays, including performers in traditional dress showing various aspect of court pageantry. Also worth visiting is the folk museum within. The buildings are predictable large and ornate, and more geometrically laid out than at other palaces. The detailing and shape of the roofs are unique, and the large number of carved stone figures, some of them unfortunately encased in transparent boxes due to unruly visitors, interesting indeed. As usual in such palaces, the women's sleeping quarters have a more livable look to them. Maintenance and upkeep are very good, reflective of the country's current prosperity."
2953,5.0,"Must visit when in Seoul. Buy ticket pass to enjoy this palace and the other three, Changdeokgung, Deoksugung, Changgyeonggung. I came when Chuseok and it's free entry. Visit Jongmyo shrine too."
2954,4.0,The largest palace in seoul built in 1395 built by the Joseon dynasty and one of the well preserved and maintained palace. Where you can see and experience the rich culture and history of south korea. Its a must visit landmark in seoul.
2955,4.0,Good place to visit and take pictures. The weather wasn't too cold when I travelled so was very enjoyable.
2956,5.0,"Visitors to Seoul should definitely not miss this gem. It's amazing how Seoul has been able to preserve such heritage. Very clean, calm, and relaxing to stroll and see the corners of the palaces."
2957,5.0,"Worth to visit, the culture and history place are well manage. they open during night on a certain period, the light are so beautiful at night. when there is are public holiday such as chusok, they give for free entrance"
2958,4.0,"even though its been fully rebuilt, alot of the old old charm still shines through. Expect to spend a few hours roaming around the grounds"
2959,5.0,We have seen most of the palaces in Korea. This one is the main one to see. Make sure to book an English tour inside and be ready to spend 2-3 hours as there is a lot to see.
2960,5.0,Well worth the visit. This is a very cultural site with great history and well managed. I always come here when i visit Korea
2961,3.0,"It was a beautiful place to see. It’s an insight into the history of Korea. If you’re planning to visit I suggest you go wearing a traditional Korean dress called a Hanbok which also gives you a free pass to the Palace. However, if you want to visit ‘The Secret Garden’ (another part of the Palace) you have to pay admission fee. It was a memorable experience. I went during November which means the weather was a bit cold, so it was uncomfortable wearing a Hanbok at the time as it is a thin material.  If you want to wear a Hanbok, you can rent it from Oneday Hanbok. It’s cheap and if you want the best looking Hanbok you have to be in early or make a booking via their email."
2962,3.0,"A big part of the palace is closed for renovation right now. So it might be worth going again, but in the current state, it's a pretty large palace and a nice promenade, not much else."
2963,5.0,"Being a fan of kdrama, I have watched several period drama where the plot is in Josean era. Gyeongbokgung palace reminds me of these drama and it gave me a lot of goosebumps. But take note that this palace is closed every Tuesday so plan your trip and consider their operation days."
2964,4.0,Must visit tourist spot in Seoul. Very big palace with interesting stone carvings and traditional buildings. Watch changing of the guards procession. Easily accessible.
2965,4.0,"I's nice but all the palaces have been locked and the tourists can only look around, can not go inside to see more about the architecture. A bit disapointed."
2966,4.0,A nice contrast to normal life in Seoul.. a must see if you are a true traveller.. very beautiful kept and a fantastic view info korean history...
2967,5.0,"Worth checking out. Palace, although smaller than the Forbidden City, was still quite large. Was nice to walk through it and see all the fall colours. Be sure to check out the elevated pagoda thing by the pond in the middle. The view of the mountains is also very nice when you walk further Northwest. You can't see inside many buildings though so you don't really need to walk through it all. You won't miss much if you don't, save the view."
2968,4.0,The place is known for being a tourist spot. I am not a big fan of palaces so for me the place was OK. However the place gives a very good insight on the Korean culture
2969,4.0,"If you are wearing the traditional Hanbok, then you no need to pay entrance fee. Good place for photo shoot during autumn."
2970,5.0,This is the highlight of Seoul for sure. It's so full of culture and beauty. Walk around the grounds and the gardens. I also highly recommend stopping at the tea house for some traditional tea and snacks. The tea was delicious; the snacks were...interesting. But it was such a great experience! You have to do it.
2971,3.0,"An okay enough place to visit. It was pouring with rain when my wife and I visited.  We were a little underwhelmed when comparing it to other palaces in Asia. Nonetheless, it is one of Seoul’s main attractions.  We spent 30 minutes there, and thought that was plenty of time."
2972,5.0,These beautiful grounds and buildings reminded me a lot of the Forbidden City in Beijing. Plan to spend a few hours walking around. There are lots of signs in English and free English guided tours available. This is a beautiful place that is a must see on anyone's trip to Seoul. It's cool to see old buildings set against the modern skyline.
2973,4.0,"One of Seoul’s place to see, lots of tourist and it is the biggest of the Palaces but it is not all finish yet lots of restoration being done as of now!"
2974,4.0,"Magnificently located in the bustling city of Seoul, this palace is worth seeing! One must have ample time to walk around or walk with a historian at least."
2975,5.0,"Autumn around Gyeonbokgung was certainly a delight, amazing architecture and gardens with the opportunity to try some royal tea and confectionary."
2976,5.0,I believe this is the largest palace that I visited while in Seoul. I bought the combination palace ticket which included 4 palaces and a shrine. This palace was beautiful. It is a must see even if you’re not interested in the history behind it. The grounds that the palace is located on is very vast as well. They offer brochures in multiple languages so it’s very convenient to visit.
2977,4.0,"Expect about 2-3 hours, depending on the crowd and personal pace of movement. The actual Palace grounds is very large and the architecture is beautiful. The Palace is also connected to the Korean Folk Museum, which is free. Wear comfortable shoes. There are traditional Korean outfit rentals nearby, which is very popular.  There were a lot of families with strollers, however there are some areas parents will have to pick up the stroller to access some entrances.  Fee for adults is 3,000won. Less for children."
2978,4.0,"Expansive grounds but very crowded even on the (literally) freezing and rainy day we visited. Free guided tours but an informative pamphlet with map is sufficient. The smaller buildings start to get repetitive as they are all identical in architecture and painting, so we ended up spending more time on the larger and more interesting buildings."
2979,4.0,"Lovely place to walk around and see the traditional and cultural part of Korea. It’s actually a huge place you can spend around 2 to 3 hrs depend on you. Can rent the traditional clothes and walk around to the palace. I came here during autumn season so I really enjoyed the sorroundings. I didnt see restaurants or shops inside so make sure your full if energy when you start sightseeing here. You need to buy ticket for the entrance fee. Some go for tour guide some don’t, like what I did I just go by myself and explore the area."
2980,3.0,Big place also flanked by palace museum and folk art museum. Can get confusing. The map can do with better navigation. Be prepared to walk in the outdoors. Can be chilly in winter. The saving grace was the English guided tour. The guide was very knowledgeable. Kids took the audio rental but it wasn’t intuitive to use and it kept repeating. Kids say the audio tour they experienced in Alcatraz was much better
2981,4.0,I went here as part of a business conference. The architecture and history were very interesting. The palace and grounds are beautiful. A good way to understand a little more about the history of Korea.
2982,4.0,We only got to sneak a peek from the outside so don't go on a Tuesday if you want to go inside. Seen many traditional dresses on people. They get in for free to certain attractions...very lovely. You can rent them too if you wanted to in the area.
2983,4.0,"This is one of the principal places of the Joseoon Dynasty in Seoul which was established few centuries back. There are several halls and requires 1-2 hours to see. The whole temple complex is huge and very attractive. There are free guided tour in different languages including English. One can also see the changing of the Palace Guard Ceremony inside the square at 1000 and 1400 hrs. There is also gate guard duty performance outside the Gwanghwamun Gage at 1100 and 1300 hrs. The temple is closed on every Tuesday. Entry fee: KRW 3000. On weekends and holidays, lot of young local population come there in their traditional dress and make the complex very colorful and attractive. Metro: Gyeongbokgung Station by Line 3 Exit 5 OR Line 5 Exit 2. Highly recommended."
2984,4.0,"A great attraction to visit in Seoul. Very affordable to enter the complex and rather large. The little ponds, lakes and gardens inside are particularly lovely! Well worth a visit!"
2985,3.0,The heat kept us from enjoying the place as much. The walk was also too long. Playing dress up was fun though. ☺
2986,5.0,"Although the property is huge, the palaces themselves aren't of grand scale. I only mention that because seeing some royalty properties around the world, these don't give off the sense of grandeur. One of the cool things about the Korean palaces is that there's shops that rent out traditional outfits for both men, women, and kids, so when walking the property, there's great photo opportunities of beautifully dressed tourists. Check out my photos to see what I mean."
2987,4.0,"The place is big. It takes quite 1 hour minimum to view the palace. It is better to take your time, relax, take photos of the beautiful place at a leisure pace. There are some shop around the area to rent your Hanbok to walk around the palace and take photo. They are currently rebuilding some building when I visit it. Overall, great trip but a bit tired from all of the walking around."
2988,5.0,"There are several other palaces in Seoul but this one is a must visit. Spend like 2-2.5hours here, it gives the best feeling. It can be crowded at times but there are certain areas within the palace area that are not and great for photo-op. Gwanghwamun gate is located here also so it's like killing two birds with one stone. Just cross the street when you're done and walk down to Gwanghwamun Square for a photo-op with King Sejong statue. Note that there is a museum under it (the statue)."
2989,4.0,"This is on top of the 5-palace tour and a scheduled concert on the grounds makes it a must see. You literally walk along paths of Korea’s history and admire its architecture. There are English tours but if you have read its history and armed with a map of the grounds, you can do the tour on your own. It is a bit of a walk and some cobbled stones may be hard for some so wear comfortable and decent clothes, or wear traditional Hanbok for instagrammable photos and you get in free. If you have the time to tour at least 3 palaces then get the combination ticket, you will save a lot."
2990,4.0,"The palace is well-maintained and beautiful. Entrance fee of S$3.80. Will be nice to be there at 10 or 11am, or 1pm and 2pm to watch the performance.  We spent a good 1.5 hours walking around the palace. This place is huge. There's a National Folk Museum just behind the palace and the entrance is free. Make sure to check that out. It's a fantastic museum gives lots of information about how Korean cultures like. Totally enjoyed it.  You can also rent a costume at the shop nearby the museum.  Must-see in Seoul if you're first time there."
2991,3.0,"Even though it's the symbol of ambient Korea, the majority of this palace is built in recent 200 years. One thing I do like is the respect and promotion to traditional culture here. If you wear Hanbok, the entry is free."
2992,5.0,We were part if a tour when we went there and ao we didn’t get to experience to fall in line for the tickets. I was imagining the k-dramas I’ve watched as I was touring the place. It was fun seeing people wearing the korean clothes in touring the place and I plan to wear a hanbok on my next trip to the palace.
2993,5.0,"We saw the changing of the guard re-enactment. It was very well done with commentary in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese, making it accessible to all. Good job to all involved! The grounds of the palace are quite large - lots of walking - but you can also see the main sights without going too far if you don't want to walk much. Many people rent traditional dress for their visit, which was great to see too. Lots of beautiful hanboks."
2994,3.0,"This is well worth a visit if you are in Seoul. It is huge and will easily take 2-3 hours to get round. The buildings, while for the most part reconstructions, are impressive, especially the throne room, even if most a reconstructions following the destruction of the originals by the Japanese when they annexed Korea. There are a lot of locals in traditional costume too - easy to hire nearby and gets them in for free as well as making for more picturesque photos.  It is stupidly cheap to get into: a couple of dollars/pounds/euros equivalent.  Do take one of the free guided tours in English (10am and 2pm but check). Without one of these, or a Korean speaker, you will be pretty-much in the dark as to the function of buildings and underlying stories. The only building open to view is the impressive throne room and the only one that you can get inside is a small memorial to a queen who was murdered by a Japanese hit-squad for opposing their takeover.  I would time a visit to take in the changing of the guard: OK, they are actors but it is well-worth the twenty minutes (and you can get into the front court to see it without paying)."
2995,4.0,Fair warning the palace is huge. Lots of photo taking opportunities especially if you're into renting the traditional costumes. There are several opportunities to catch actors reenacting scenes of the king and queen moving around with their entourage. Also the change of guard ceremony really brings you back in time.  Found the best time to take pictures is just before closing. You'll have 30mins to an hour to yourself to grab some good shots without a tourist walking into your frame.
2996,5.0,We spent about two hours walking around on a late weekday afternoon. The palace grounds were busy but not overcrowded. Not many employees there to help answer a question if we had any but that did not detract from a very pleasant and inexpensive (less than 5 euro) walk around a beautiful area. We were not able to catch any of the shows but heard from another guests they are worth seeing. Would definitely recommend to do when in Seoul.
2997,5.0,Nice historical palace in Seoul you will enjoy typical Korean architecture and history with lovely style and colors
2998,5.0,We visited the palace on the last day. Can only visited part of it because we need to go another place. The weather was sunny. Many local people wearing the national costume visited the palace. Luckily we can see the shift ceremony.
2999,4.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is very large and it’s a pleasant walk around the structures and green spaces. To get there, get off at the Gyeongbokgung station (metro/bus) its 2 blocks away/ 5 min walk to the palace, some buses may take you just in front of the palace but check your route for details. Maybe before or after your visit you may enjoy a lunch at Tosokchon Samgyetang (opens at 10:30) only a short walk away, they are known for their ginger chicken soup but expect long lines after 12 noon. I didn't think there was a lot to see but architecture and the cultural value is worth a visit. You can try to be at the front entrance for the changing of the guard at 11:00 and 13:00 (free). I must warn you the changing of the guard is more of a reenactment and is a bit “cheesy” as the guards are more actors than real guards, they're pictures ops for tourists, the fake beards doesn't help. I would think as part of the job they would have to have a real one. If you want to go inside go to the right pass the entrance to get a ticket, 3000w/pp. I recommend making your way up to the National Folk Museum of Korea and exit the palace by the gates just below. That exit gate is only a short walk to the Bukchon Hanok Village."
3000,3.0,"This palace complex is easily reached by the metro. It offers a very nice day visit in autumn to view some autumn foliage, and offers large areas of walking spaces. The attractions are nicely spaced out, sothat even though there are huge numbers of visitors, we were able to easily find some quiet spots to relax and see some of the structural attractions.  Allow about half a day to view the different structural buildings in a relaxing mode. There was an ongoing renovation of some iconic sights in the palace complex which we were not informed. But still, it made for a nice autumn day trip. In terms of autumn foliage, Deoksugung is more spectacular.  Public restrooms were extremely clean, as always we have experienced in Seoul."
3001,4.0,"We were able to watch the exchange of guards in the palace at 1pm, the ceremony lasted for 10 minutes. They use big drums and old flutes before the guards do their marching."
3002,4.0,"Visited on 15/11/2017, massive palace in the middle of the city. The palace was clean, gardens were well looked after. Great place to spent a couple of hours. Entrance fee 3000 Won."
3003,4.0,Full of colored leaves every where. The weather was great so we could enjoy the nature literally. Full of visitors in traditional customs that make the garden more beautiful. The house “Geonchung-gung” where King Gojong and Queen Min lived together was still open for public. Geonchung gung is the place where Queen Min was assassinated by Japanese street gangsters.
3004,5.0,"It is such a large palace in the central of Seoul. You can take subway there easily as the signage is everywhere.  The palace is beautiful with traditional architecture. If you rent hanbok to wear then entrance tickets are free. Again, it is very crowded for photos.  It is quite spacious so wear comfortable shoes and hats. It is a popular place so a lot of tourists wearing hanbok, which is quite nice. Hanbok rental shops are just opposite the street.  There are some spots in the palace under construction including beautiful pond with red leaves. Hope it can be finished soon."
3005,4.0,The palace is just amazing. It is beauty and grand at the same time. It's a nice place to learn Korean history at the same time you can enjoy the scenery.
3006,4.0,"Very impressive in size. Well maintained. We did not have time to visit the museums but will take the time when we come back. Many people wearing traditional tunics made this experience very special. I was almost more interested by them than the palace itself! We did not take a guide, which would have probably made the tour more interesting. For 3,000 won, it is a nice place to visit and you can take time to wander and immerse yourself in the old, while the new Seoul is only steps away."
3007,5.0,"This place brings you back to the monarch times of royal families in South Korea. This is a very huge place with wonderful scenery around during autumn! Leaves of various trees with different leaves colors and hues ranging from reds, browns, yellows, greens to any color you can think of in between those mentioned colors.  The royal guard parade in the morning is one of the highlights of the palace visit. Many tourists enjoy the sight in this place along with the 2 more palaces situated nearby this area.  The structure of this palace shows how meticulous ancient people were in designing intricately the style of this palace. Indeed a Korean-like experience especially when you wear their national costume when you are roaming around the place."
3008,4.0,"This is a must visit in Seoul. We didn't do a tour but enjoyed walking round and taking pictures. Entry fee was 3,000 won which was about £2. We spent a good few hours here and enjoyed it."
3009,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is a superb place that the whole family would definitely enjoy. The palace is surrounded by establishments where you can find ""Hanbok"" or ""Korean Traditional Dress"" for rent. It is located at the heart of capital of Seoul (Hanyang) and at the back of it is ""The National Folk Museum of Korea"". When we visited, there's an ongoing cultural presentation which they sang beautiful traditional songs.  Insadong-gil is just a walking distance from Gyeongbokgung Palace that's well known as ""traditional streets"" where you can find traditional porcelain, metal and wooden chopsticks, handcrafted keychains and handmade wallets.  *Located at 161 Sajik-ro, Sejongno, Jongno-gu, Seoul, South Korea *Entrance going to Gyeongbokgung Palace - 3,000 won (each)"
3010,5.0,Although we missed the changing of the guards we totally enjoyed the palace grounds. Must visit especially in autumn - very surreal- and affordable too at 3000 kwn (freebif you are wearing hanbook). Allow at least 2-3hrs to cover the grounds and its surroundings.
3011,5.0,Well worth the visit if you are in Seoul for a few days. Very impressive oriental structures and the grounds are very well maintained. Cheap enough entry and was easy to get to by subway
3012,4.0,I spent almost 4 hours here. I suggest you to come here in the morning so you could stay longer. We were so lucky that we got a free tour guide that day.  Don’t forget to try the hanbok and watch the exchange guard ceremony. Very recommended. 👍🏻
3013,4.0,Went on a Monday and it was not too crowded. Managed to join the English walking tour and the guide was great in sharing the history. The buildings were very well maintained.  Apparently visitors dressed in hanbok gets to go in for free. There are hanbok rental shops near the palace and Insadong.it was about 20000won for 2 hours. There are many visitors dressed in Hanbok so it does feels like going back in time (if not for the selfie sticks)  We took train to Anguk Station and walk to the palace.. about 10mins walk. Join the guided tour..
3014,5.0,"This was a very pleasant Palace to visit. It's only 3,000 Won (£2 sterling). which is great value. It a huge area so although there are many visitors it never seemed overcrowded. It's mainly buildings and structures with number of opportunities to view the insides. There is a children's museum exhibition area and a mock up of an old street which was interesting. The grounds were immaculate as you come to expect in Korea....  It has an added attraction that there are many (lots and lots) of people in tradition Hanbok costume which really adds to the atmosphere and gives many photo opportunities.  You also have free entry to he National Palace Museum of Korea in the same grounds and that is a very impressive museum, first class...... Do not miss visiting the museum.  In total it will take at least two hours to go around to give it justice including the museum etc easily three hours.... I feel your better dong one of the palaces thoroughly rather than trying to rush around the all just to tick the box. !!!  In summary well worth he visit and do visit the National Palace Museum...."
3015,3.0,"We felt this palace is too overrated since the artifacts inside are not all original, many were destroyed during the Japanese occupation. The palaces are quite small (if compared to China's Forbidden City) and not much to see. Some parts are also being restored/ rebuilt."
3016,4.0,"Its a good place to wander around wearing hanbok, and you are free to enter if you wear one. We got to see the changing of the guards ceremony and its like a kdrama scene😊. The place is pretty specially in autumn."
3017,4.0,"Usually I'm the architecture junkie that make sure every trip is filled with historical sites and buildings, but Gyeongbokgung to be honest, didn't lived up to my expectations. The palace is rather big and empty( in terms of decor / plants etc) I'm not sure if its because I went in Autumn, and the plants died off + there was an event setup going on in the middle of the palace (kinda ruins the vibe). Some of the buildings are closed of for repairs extension for winter(?), which made my visit kinda disappointed. But the palace was rather big and the museum at the side was worth the visit."
3018,5.0,For the first time we wearing hanbok. And it is the best experience ever. We will return here again.
3019,4.0,Imagine having to walk the same paths within the palace walls as the kings of Goryeo ... Joseon Dynasty.
3020,5.0,We went on a weekday while my partner rented a Hanbok for 4 hours. Entry to palace (otherwise 3000 won ) was free for people wearing Hanbok. Beautiful palace with a museum inside to explore. Lots of places for ‘ that perfect photo’ opportunity. Good half a day spent on this venue. Highly recommended.
3021,5.0,"We visited the palace and arrived just as a free English speaking tour was starting, very useful and gave us a real taste for what happened in times past. As an added bonus there was reduced priced entry for seniors, we had photos of our passports on our phones!!"
3022,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is beautiful we toured around Seoul on a whistle top tour in October on the Hop on Hop off Bus at Chuseok holiday time, this is one of the best times to visit Seoul as the queues are less and most of the attractions are free for the holidays. Unfortunately we had so little time here, but it was beautiful. You must visit this Palace to understand the rich cultural past of South Korea."
3023,4.0,This palace is big but can get so busy. Watch out for the change of guard ceremony times. The pavillion that I was looking forward to is being renovated until 2019. There's a reason to go back then. :)
3024,5.0,Really enjoyed my visit at the Gyeongbokgung Palace. We were able to join a free English tour and the tour guide did an excellent job at explaining some of the palaces history. Tip: Join the free tour group. Check website for time.
3025,4.0,"The last time we were in Seoul about three years back, we chanced on the changing of the guard at the Gwanghwamun in front of the palace. Then it was crowded with throngs of tourists. On this trip with some friends, we decided we would get a good position to see the entire ceremony and visit the palace as well (a bonus was a visit to the National Palace Museum nearby). Since China curtailed visits by its citizens over the installation of anti-missile systems in South Korea, the crowd was much smaller and we were afforded excellent views of the ceremony. The palace too was likewise not very crowded and gave us lots of time to wander about and admire the architecture and the displays. Free admission to both events was a bonus. And there were lots of people in hanboks, or traditional Korean dress, A while back, a rule was introduced that people wearing hanboks (Korean or otherwise), did not have to pay for entry into the various palaces that charged entry. It was quite amusing to see Caucasians, South Asians, and pretty much everything in between in hanbok. The changing of the guard ceremony is held three times a day, 11.00 a.m., 1.30 p.m. and 3.00 p.m. But check the website and tourist guides."
3026,4.0,"A must to place to visit if you are into history of a place. They have a guided tour (English speaking). You can also wear Hanbok, their traditional clothes in South Korea. The place is huge, you can get lost. But they have beautiful garden for picture taking."
3027,5.0,If you want to know more about Korea as a first visitor you must see this palace to understand more about the incredibly rich culture of South Korea
3028,4.0,"We loved visiting this place. We were fortunate to go on the last Wednesday of the month and get admission for free. I recommend exiting out the ""back"" entrance and checking out the Blue House, then walking around Hanok village after!"
3029,5.0,"Good view /big place/easy to find/wonderful place /i think ,,u should come to there everything is good"
3030,5.0,Visited for a second time when friends from Canada came to see us. Great time of year when the leaves are changing. Colorful Changing of the Guard-worth your time.
3031,4.0,"If you have to choose from the 4 palaces to visit in Seoul city, choose this. Join the English tour so you will understand the history behind the different structures found in this area."
3032,5.0,"English tour was lovely. Very similar to other big Asian palaces- clean and not super crowded. Last Wed of every month is free entry all national heritage sites, but only 10$ entry other days anyways"
3033,5.0,"Rental costs for hanbok costs around 30000 won each for both men and women so it's worth getting as the entrance ticket is around 10000 won. So might as well take pictures with the hanbok if you like the idea!  Big complex with many smaller buildings and large gardens. At certain times of the day, there are parades and a change of the guard. Don't miss one of them!"
3034,5.0,"We went to Seoul by using a tour package. Our tour guide was so frustrated that the tour package is not inclusive of visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace, Korean culture. Therefore, during the free time, we went here. Not knowing the place is MUCH BIGGER PLACE. We stopped at the second entrance cause the time 11.00 AM will show performance on Royal Gate shift change.  There are hourly free guided tour ; English, Chinese, Japanese and etc. Free entrance and you can come here by subway ; Gyeongbokgung. I didnt any see souvenir shop here. Too bad :("
3035,5.0,A must visit sight in Seoul. Extensive buildings of restored royal palace. Changing of the guard is touristy fun. Very little inside the halls except for one exhibition.
3036,5.0,"Surroundings are clean and the place is so authentic. You can enjoy korean food inside the palace... Latest Entrance price is 3000won.. For those people wearing korean traditional hanbok, entrance is free :)"
3037,4.0,Check when the free guided tours are. This included in your ticket. The palace is not very grand but still beautiful. Our free guided tour was also interesting. A must-do if visiting Seoul for the first time.
3038,4.0,Top tourist spot in Seoul. Free entrance if you wear hanbok . Ticket is 3000 for normal admission. Follow the guided tour to understand better on the history of this building.
3039,5.0,We stopped here for the sole purpose of taking some great pictures for our walls at home. Other than the site being under construction during our visit which limited the availability of some of the areas we were pleased.
3040,5.0,"This Palace is a must visit, especially for those visiting Seoul for the first time. The palace grounds are wide and spacious, so it may take up to a half day to explore this historical site. You will just be awed at the design and colours of the place. The weather can be very hot in October, so make sure you bring your sunnies and water bottle. I took a lot of pictures, can’t get enough of the place, but of course the pictures are unable to demonstrate the beauty and atmosphere of the place. So, must really go visit it!"
3041,5.0,"So if you are visiting Seoul, I think this palace is definitely worth it. The landscape is beautiful the architectures breath taking. While you are there you can see lots of people dressed in traditional attire and for those picture aficionados, the palace offers great views. Not to mention the history behind the actual palace."
3042,5.0,"This is a lovely, well maintained palace with lots to see. The grounds are also well maintained and the pond with the pagoda in the middle is a nice view to look at while relaxing and taking in the scenery."
3043,4.0,I underestimated the size of this place and it took me much longer to see the place than I thought. I made sure to arrive in time to see the changing of the guard ceremony.
3044,4.0,Access to the attraction was convenient via subway. The structures and buildings are well preserved or refurbished.  The free explanation tour available in few languages is highly recommended. Do check the official website for the available languages and timing. Embark on a 1.0-1.5 hours history lesson on purposes of the buildings and imagine how they would look like in the old times.  We went with young baby in a stroller. We found out that certain areas are not so stroller/wheelchair friendly but overall was ok.  Plenty of spots for good phototaking on a nice sunny day so bring your lenses!
3045,4.0,An impressive location in the middle of the large city and in the area of parliament and government buildings. Many interesting palace buildings. It is recommended to take a guided tour as it helps to understand the historical happenings.
3046,5.0,"I've been to Korea three times, and every single time I always visit Gyeongbokgung Palace. I can never get enough of this beautiful ancient relic. On my recent trip, my family and I decided to wear hanboks and it made for some amazing pictures. The entry for the palace is free, if you hire hanboks."
3047,5.0,"The Palace of Shining Happiness is just that. It's relaxing, beautiful and great for photos. Allow 1/2 day to walk around"
3048,4.0,"With access from the subway station named for the palace, buses that stop right in front, and parking spaces almost inside the walls, this palace lends itself to being visited. And on the second of Chuseok this year, many many people took advantage of the free entry and crowded into the palace. As an example of the Joseon dynasty building style, this palace presents all the traditions. Offering many scenic places in which to photograph oneslef and one's companions, it is a lovely place to capture memories. What I personally love is that there are many places where the backdrop to the palace buildings are just the hills behind - no tall buildings, no 21st century intrusions. The museum is worth a visit as well."
3049,5.0,If your as hIstory buff or just a tourist looking to see Ancient Korean Culture and architect then this is the place for you. I spent more time here then most observing the layout of the palace grounds and the architect then anything else.
3050,3.0,Interesting place but not enough structure or explanation. Nice place to rent a hanbok and snap some selfies. Sometimes there are extra activities or music. A bit overrated in my opinion.
3051,5.0,"there's one big palace and a indoor museum. Admission is free to both place. Alot of ladies renting hanbok from nearby shop (facing main road turn right and cross the street, turn right and enter left thru small lane.) rental range from 10k won to 20k won(2hr) 15k to 25k to 4hr and 25k to 35k for whole day."
3052,5.0,One of the places that recommended to visit. We can rent a Handbook and take nice pictures at the palace. The small palace by the lake was on the old 10000 won billete. Nice palace and very clean.
3053,5.0,"In the middle of town there is a little oasis. Great fun to see the Koreans getting dressed when visiting. Plenty of buildings to see and a nice stroll all around. When we were there, a simulated (mock) attack on the American embassy took place by 3 helicopters and abseilers with some accompanying big bangs - quite spectacular to watch."
3054,5.0,"Highly recommended to visit this place! Entry for an individual is 3,000 Korean Won (AED 9/ $2). You can either walk the entire place yourself and take time to read the descriptions, or you can catch a free tour (10 people at a time) and they provide guides of different languages (Eng, Jap, Chinese & Korean) just check for timings. Recommeded to go as early as 10AM before the school trips & tour trips come over and over crowd the place! The amount of history in this place is amazing, clean & quite frankly can be a maze!"
3055,4.0,"We visited the place for the propose of photography, we took pictures for the tourists with the cultural costumes but the heat was great problem at that time. Most of the palaces for out side view only. But worth visiting."
3056,5.0,"Totally worth it to go inside, it costed 3usd pp approx. The place is huge and has amazing views. Also recommended to see the guard change at 10am or 2pm."
3057,3.0,"This is a lovely way to spend a morning before the crowds, its a large complex and is well restored. We were there during the Chasseuk Holiday so all the palaces were free and many people were dressed in traditional costumes. The changing of the guards is a good thing for kids."
3058,4.0,"Since I visited this during Chuseok holiday, it quite crowded and difficult to get nice shot but good thing to compesate that is free entrance. I spent hours admiring their fine art and cant believe this palace so old but still majestic. I figured out lot of entrance to the palace, you can walk from bukchon hanok village, or from dongdaemon or take a subway and stop at jongno-3-ga and walk. Many ways at our convenient."
3059,5.0,"This is Seoul's main palace. It is certainly not to be missed. If you have limited time in Seoul, this is the palace you need to visit. The palace offers free group tours. English tours are every day during 11:00am, 1:30pm, and 3:30pm. The palace also has tours in Japanese and Chinese. Most of what can be seen in the grounds are reconstructions. Interestingly, the Imperial Throne Hall survives both the Japanese colonial rule and the Korean War and is one of Korea's national treasures (National Treasure No. 223). There are still many reconstruction and restoration efforts going on the palace grounds. So, try going back a few years and see what has been returned back to its former glory."
3060,5.0,Very lovely place with lots to see inside. You can take a leisurely walk inside the palace and admire the views. We also went near autumn so the trees were lovely! Definitely one of my favorite places.
3061,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace was crowded as it was Chuseok, translated as ""Korean Thanksgiving"" in English. We watched the changing of the guards which displayed colorful uniforms, musical instruments, and formations for the traditional ceremony. One must be in good shape to climb the stairs to the palace."
3062,5.0,"Visited on a weekend break to Seoul. Entry to everything was free but not sure if that was because it was Chuseok. The whole place is amazing, really well preserved and rebuilt. The contrast between the skyscrapers and the ancient palace is amazing! When we went there were Koreans dressed in traditional dress walking around and if you turned the corner to an empty courtyard with only a couple of Koreans dressed in Hambok walking along you felt like you'd gone back in time! It's an absolute must in Seoul!!"
3063,4.0,"The Palace's royal guard changing ceremony is the best experience, providing very good experience of traditional Korea culture and traditional army clothes. The Palace s very similar to China' Forbidden City but i a smaller scale."
3064,5.0,"We walked to the Palace from Hanok village. From the outside palace doesn’t seem that big, but once you get inside it’s easy to get lost. For someone who lives in China and who saw so many temples Palace itself wasn’t anything new or breathtaking, but for people who have never been to Asia I’m sure it’s breathtaking. I loved the nature. In the end we saw guards in front of the main entrance. They have their show every hour or two. Make sure to rent hanok before coming to the palace to feel like a part of history :)"
3065,4.0,"This is a must-see place, but it's also one of those that doesn't really have any surprises. Splendid architecture, and impressive site and sense of history, but I sort of knew what to expect. Both palaces are worthwhile, and this a bit grander, but with the crowds its not really anything that knocks your socks off, which is why I gave it a 4 and not a 5."
3066,5.0,We had a great day visiting this palace and decided to make a special effort to hire costumes for the family which would gain us free entry into the place as an added bonus.. there are lots of places you can do this and the staff are very helpful in dressing you! As English visitors we were in the minority! It was a very hot day and could only last two hours in the costume but the place could easily be experienced in this time
3067,3.0,"For those who are familiar with korean drama, you would recognise the buildings from this palace. I visited this palace 8 years ago and it is still beautiful. Visitors wearing the traditional hanbok can enter the palaces for free! This is an experience everyone should try.. donning the hanbok in the palace and admiring the beauty of history. Note: there are plenty of people wearing the hanbok so don't worry about being the odd one out. Just go to many of the rental boutique around the palaces."
3068,5.0,The palace is one of the must see attractions at Seoul. If you were to rent the Hanbook (traditional Korean) costume you can enter the palaces for free. Great for photo taking.
3069,3.0,"Gyeongbokgunf palace is located in the center of Seoul, yet you can feel that the palace takes you back to the time of Josun Dynasty. I like the atomosphere of the palace and one can see many visitors wearing Han-Bok there."
3070,5.0,Must place for travellers looking for a real-Korean place for unforgettable memory in Seoul. Five star recommendation.
3071,5.0,I visited Gyeongbokgung Palace with a tour guide in a group. The palace is very big with many buildings and we took lots of photos with the palace in the background. I recommend this place for anyone visiting Seoul.
3072,5.0,Came here on the tour provided from the airport during a layover. The architecture is just amazing. Photos don't capture just how grand it really is to stand under these amazing buildings. Enjoyed the changing of the guard ceremony. Since this was part of a larger tour we only had about an hour to see the front area and chamber. As I understand it there was much more to see that we just didn't have time for. ideal plan to spend 2-3 (maybe more depending on your stamina and interest level). Enjoy a beautiful picnic. There was a fee to enter but since it was included in the tour price I am not sure how much it was. Enjoy!
3073,4.0,"Admission is not free, but i went during their national holiday so it was free entrance when i went there. Huge place and there are many beautiful backdrops for taking photos. However, it was very crowded due to the public holiday. Very relaxed place, but limited shades so recommended to go in the morning or late afternoon. It is a little difficult to walk as the ground are mostly sand and uneven pavement. Wear comfortable shoes!"
3074,3.0,Unfortunately the palace was closed and we only managed to walk around its perimeter and took some photos of its red main entrance door. There were many locals and tourists milling around in colourful hanboks and traditional costumes and taking pictures.
3075,4.0,Busy but beautiful. Watch out for the sun and heat as there is not much shade available. Parts of the palace are covered in dirt instead of paved so don't wear your favourite shoes. Would recommend!
3076,5.0,Located near the city. Watched changing of the guards ceremony and tour guide showed us around the palace. There is a museum near by and good place to start tour. Interesting history.
3077,5.0,Great place to visit. We went during a Public Holiday a great vibe. Beautiful surroundings. Easy to get to on the Subway
3078,4.0,This is a very neat place to see when you are visiting Seoul. It has a lot of history an they offer tours of the Garden in English and Chinese.
3079,4.0,A glimpse of the history of S Korea. We really enjoyed the changing of guards ceremony and the museum inside the palace.
3080,3.0,"You can download an app, it gets more interesting if you hear what the room or that spot was before. If you just walk around there you might get bored as it was just really the palace grounds. People wearing hanbok made it really nice too.  I was actually expecting to see the throne rooms, old kitchen, dining area etc... its a nice place to check-out if you are really interested in Korean traditional and historical architecture. You will just walk around the area but you cannot actually go in or I never tried.  People will bring their tripod here as it really makes a good backdrop."
3081,3.0,Large impressive buildings that look a lot like Chinese architecture. I couldn't really appreciate it because I don't have any context for Korean culture.
3082,5.0,Awesome! Visiting this place was really a wonderful experience. I felt like i was being transported to Joseon dynasty. So bad i didn't see the royal guards changing ceremony.
3083,3.0,Replica rebuilt. Feels like a theme park.  But the mountains backdrop is nice. Gives a sense of wideness and depth.  Chuseok week free entrance.
3084,3.0,"Had very high expectations of this based on rave reviews on Trip Advisor. But was underwhelmed. It's decent enough. In good condition and some nice architecture, but I guess I've been spoiled with the Forbidden City.  Usually 3000 KRW entry but was free for holiday. Checkout the men in traditional uniform. Great for a pic.  Multiple entry gates. Not many bathrooms Always busy"
3085,4.0,"Perhaps the largest and most popular palace. Guards change regularlly (we enjoyed their stuck on beards!), and there was also a parade of royalty, ladies-in-waiting and guards which was fun. All buildings rebuilt and repainted in the 1800-1900s since pretty much burnt down by the Japanese in the 1600s. You see the same Josean period architecture everywhere in Korea (Buddhist temples etc) since most things older seem to have been destroyed centuries ago. Lots of girls and young women in hired Hanok costumes as this gives free entrance but adds to the atmosphere for all. Allow a couple of hours."
3086,5.0,I want to preface this review by saying that although the palace might be smaller than others in Asia I believe it still to be a great experience. One also has to consider that all but a few buildings were destroyed during the Japanese occupation of Korea and it is still under re-construction.  I really enjoyed my visit to Gyeogbokgung. You can view many of the old palace buildings and see of the royals of Korea lived before the modern times. There are many artifacts that are original located in the buildings but unfortunately many of the buildings are reconstructions due to being destroyed by the Japanese during their occupation. With this is mind I still believe this is a great experience and a historical attraction that is worth visiting in Seoul. The guided tours in English are also well worth it and are free. The entrance fee is also very cheap and just a couple thousand won!
3087,4.0,No trip to Seoul would be complete without a visit to one of its palaces. You can't do better than the Gyeongbok Palace. It's a well-invested couple of hours.
3088,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace was our favorite of all the palaces in Seoul. The grounds are beautiful and the buildings, along with their settings are picture perfect."
3089,3.0,It was good for picture taking but that was pretty much it. I guess because we didn’t have a tour guide with us.
3090,5.0,If you unfamiliar with Asian (Korean-Chinese) history then this place is must visit! You can find all sort of temples and historical reconstructions. Also they have some shows where you can listen traditional Korean music and watch the performance. Lots of art galleries near by. So if you get tired of it then you can change the place to some modern art.
3091,4.0,"Hmmm.. mixed feelings on this, this palace has been rebuilt ( like much of Seouls historical places) ater being destroyed numerous times through war. A little disappointing - none the less it serves as a great vessel to get some background into the histroical past of South Korea"
3092,5.0,Must see piece of Korean cultural history for any tourists in Seoul! Free admission and musuems attatched to the palace grounds.
3093,5.0,"Renting a Hambok and having your hair done is so worth the less than $2. So fun walking around the palace feeling so special! The palace, although a replica of the original, is ornate and beautiful."
3094,5.0,I’ve visited this palace on national holidays it was insane since there’s so many ppl but you can see Korean cultural things It was so beautiful to walk around and was interesting to see it in the center of the city
3095,5.0,Going to the palace was a lot of fun our guide took us to rent hanbok before going to the palace. It was a lot of fun to walk around and see the many things at the palace.
3096,5.0,"This was out favourite place to visit during the trip. It let you know more about history about Korea. Beautiful place, if you like history, then you must visit this place"
3097,4.0,"Went to this palace last two weeks! Didn’t even plan to go here but seeing as it is really close to Insa-dong, we rent Hanbok for two hours and walk around 5minutes to see this palace. So many people so might have to wait in order to get good spots for photos! Overall, great experience even though we don’t have enough time to explore all parts of the palace. Great atmosphere and nice scenery!"
3098,5.0,"The area offers a glimpse of the royal past of korea. It provides a better understanding of korean palace life.  Tips: - rent a hanbok and walk around in traditional attire (most rentals also include free entrance to related sites) - there are free walking tours (english ) so good to check the schedule at the entrance - study the package offers (single entry ticket vs all entry ticket to 5 related sites) before buying your ticket...and grab a map at the ticket area (maps are free) - wear comfortable shoes, clothing and sunblock... - make sure to hydrate and have a lip balm handy (weather can be sunny AND windy) - for those with medical condition or are easily hungry, bring a snack if you plan to tour everything that is on the map :) - watch out for changing of the guards and other ""presentations"" - you can take a picture of/with the guards...the only reminder given was to please not touch them - take your time, appreciate the past and enjoy the stories behind each structure"
3099,3.0,If u have extra time in d city n get bored of people watching Come here for a peaceful one hr or two before flying off
3100,5.0,This was absolutely stunning and historical. It is located in a very central area that is easy to get to via metro. I would give this place at least half a day because there is so much to see and there is also another museum that lies inside of the palace. You should also go around the Hanok Village Area to rent a Hanbok to walk around the palace and neighborhood to take pictures. You can even enter the palace for free if you walk in with your Hanbok.
3101,5.0,Crowded but worth it. You can spend just and hour and see the highlights or go slow and spend hours just experiencing history. Go early in the day to avoid some crowds.
3102,5.0,"It's one of important things to see in Seoul and remember to visit the hanok village just walking distance and maybe passing to insa dong where you can buy hand crafted staff , as all 3 in same area same station stop Anguk"
3103,5.0,Me and my friends have decided to have a walk and see around in Seoul and that’s a place where we wanted to try The place a bit crowded and really nice to see
3104,4.0,"This a major sightseeing location and is popular. Go early! It is excellent, there are many building to see. try to get there for the spectacular Changing of the Guard all done is some amazing costumes."
3105,4.0,Our visit coincided with Moon Festival so admission was free and the timing coincided with the Changing of the Guard ceremony. Very colourful and unlike any other such ceremony anywhere else. The palace itself is definitely worth a visit with a lot of interesting buildings and architecture. The area is quite large and there is also an entrance to National Folk Museum which has a very welcome cafeteria/snack bar.
3106,5.0,We went during the Oct holidays so there was a lot of local Koreans wearing their traditional cloths The palace has a lot of buildings and is next to a museum of Korean history The buildings are very busy impressive particularly since it is in the middle of Seoul. Highly recommended
3107,5.0,"Peaceful, serene royal and most importantly a must-see attraction in Seoul. I am not a history or touristy place visitor. I enjoy beach, quiet and easy-going places. This time me and my wife visited this Palace just to see how the look and feel of the place is. It is really a place for spending quiet time and get lost in your thoughts.  The lake and structure in the middle is really something one should experience. The calmness and cool breeze even in the may-june afternoon sun does makes it relaxing. They have folk dance and song show at the palace. Coffee shop is a typical touristy place for drinks and leisure out.  Overall, if you are a history-buff do visit this place.  Cheers, BokaBoy"
3108,4.0,You can rent Hanbok for 1-2 hr before entrance the palace. It's free entrance fee if not you have to pay the fee(I'm not sure for the price). Near the palace have shopping street and many cafe.
3109,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is a beautiful example of Korean architecture, albeit rebuilt. This palace is the oldest and I rate it a definite must see. This palace served as the seat of government during most of the Joseon Dynasty. Well worth a visit."
3110,5.0,"you can go at night or morning. Both times are good. You can see colors of changing leaves in the morning. At night, they have some cultural activities."
3111,4.0,"A Must do if it's you're first time visiting South Korea. The palace is beautiful, Entrance fee was about 3000 won. you can also watch the changing of the royal guard ceremony."
3112,5.0,"This temple is the best in Seoul, SK. Entrance is only $3,000W like $3usd. There is so much to do inside the place. There is also a museum and a few other shrines. This was my favourite spot in Seoul. Make sure you go there early because it gets packed so it is tough to take pics without people around. This is a MUST."
3113,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace was worth the trip across Seoul - we walked it to get a feel for the city but you could easily take the Metro. The entrance is intricate and worth a picture in front of the gate, the palace itself is beautiful and is a good spot to sit and relax for a few minutes outside of it just to take it all in. We were there on a Sunday and there were quite a few people dressed in traditional Korean clothes, still uncertain as to why, but it added to the experience. You should allot about an hour or two to wander the grounds."
3114,3.0,This is part of the 4 main palace in Seoul. You can get a combined ticket for all the 4 palaces of else an individual ticket costs 2000 KRW. We didn't intend to go to all the 4 palaces and hence bought individual tickets. The palace itself is a bit underwhelming. We spent an hour walking around the grounds and it's alright if the weather is good. It's one of the tick the boxes attraction in Seoul and you could visit it if you feel the need to. Not missing much if you don't have the time.
3115,5.0,The biggest and the oldest palace in seoul. Very nice experience for a foreign tourist to see local culture
3116,3.0,"Arrived after an interesting Subway ride, this is a vast complex take your time enjoy it. my expectation was alot higher based on the Photos I had seen previously. Still Interesting worth a visit"
3117,5.0,"The subway takes you right to the entrance. 3000 fee to enter is amazing. If you want to rent a costume nearby for 10000 then you free entrance. Touring of actual buildings is limited, but able to see in a few. There are tours offered but we did not take one. Read that tours of the pavilion are available but must be booked via internet at least one day in advance. Wear sunblock as shade is minimal. Wear good shoes as path can be uneven. The architecture is amazing and we really enjoyed as this was our first trip to an oriental country... completely different than anything we had seen."
3118,5.0,We were in for a pleasant surprise as we happened to come across this palace! Beautiful palace with plenty to see! Definitely recommend! We were lucky to see a concert there in the evening filled with amazing Korean music - must see!
3119,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace , was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty. Built in 1395, it is located in northen  Seoul,now National Palace  Museum of Korea and National Folk Museum   I went to Gyeongbokgung Palace in 2/9/2017.The ticket was 3000 KWN.The ticket office not crowded. The entrance is a massive open area with the palace in front of a serene mountain backdrop. Although not the original construction.It is contain 6 gates (Gwanghwamun The Main and South Gate,Heungnyemun The Second Inner Gate ,Geunjeongmun Gate,Sinmumun Gate,Geonchunmun Gate and Yeongchumun The West Gate .Moreover it contain many buildings like Gyeonghoeru ,The King's Quarters ,The Throne Hall , magnificent park ,lakes and Etc.  I enjoyed In this place .But,The weather was hot when I came.You must see this Attraction."
3120,3.0,"This palace was nice to see for historical reasons, but it is not impressive after you have seen the Forbidden City. It is similar, but smaller and less appointed. Enjoy the extras they have at different times, like shows, teas, and such."
3121,3.0,Quite a sight. Grand and beautiful. But thats it. Just a place for u to take photos. Shdnt spend more than an hour here unless you are doing a photoshoot or something.
3122,5.0,"Wonderful architecture and a must to visit. Would be ideal to have a proper tour guide to show your around and understand the history of each of the structure. Part of the palace was destroyed during the world war, but they preserved what is left and they build a replica."
3123,5.0,This is o must to see in Seoul very nice Palace.. take you time to Walk around in the Palace 1.5 hour is Good
3124,5.0,"We visited here using the metro via exit 5 at Gyeongbokgung station. We first paid a short visit to the National Palace museum which had free entrance before visiting Gyeongbokgung palace. Entry fees was KRW 3000/pax. The palace complex was big and the structures were beautiful. Plenty of visitors here and many took the opportunity of posing in the Korean national costume for photos. We spent a good 2 to 3 hours walking around and taking photos. As it was autumn, some of the leaves were already changing colours. If you only have time to visit one palace in Seoul, this is it. We didn't wait around to observe the changing of the guards here."
3125,5.0,"Entering the Palace grounds is deceptive - it is really a large complex and you could spend a good deal of time exploring the buildings.  You can rent a hanbok & venture into this palace, like it was Joseon period.  The architectural details are beautiful. Love the to sit beside a lake & relax."
3126,4.0,"We went to the palace we only had an hour to be there before it closed, I suggest to go there in the first half of the day because they close 4 pm (Korean time) The price I paid is 9000KRW I've got a discount since I am a student. The place itself is beautiful but I think that it suits the best for people who are interested in historical destinations. I did enjoy the place because I learned more about unknown to me Korean culture. P.S. Everyone is very friendly"
3127,5.0,"It is a wonderful historic site and is quite big so make sure to take water and comfy shoes. You also have free access to a museum that is inside the compound. Its a great day time activity, right in the middle of the city."
3128,5.0,"Breathtaking view of the metro facing the extremely old facade of Gyeongbukgung Palace is exquisitely the best. Having the mountains of Korea as the backdrop, the palace for the Crowned Prince of Korea is the place to be if you're lusty of the epic royalties of Korea. Why not to try some Hanbok for an experience of a lifetime?"
3129,5.0,"I've been to Korea over and over, and I always ended up here, because they always have many festivals held in the palace. It's beautiful during spring, autumn and winter. If you are wearing hanbok (Korean traditional clothe) then you get free admission to enter the palace."
3130,5.0,This is lovely and not very crowded. We took a guided tour of the garden. Would call this a must do in Seoul.
3131,5.0,"It's a beautiful palace, at certain time during the day (10:00am) I believe, there is ceremony of the guard change. It's was fun to see it. The palace itself is gorgeous. We had a guide so the experience was even better because it included explanation of the history/culture. Overall I recommend it if you are in Seoul!"
3132,4.0,Sadly we visited this palace on a rainy day. So could not see all the parts of this beautiful palace. Still whatever we could see was beautiful in its own way. Its better to take a guided tour of this place just in case u want to know the historical aspects.
3133,5.0,"The palace is beautiful, its architecture standsout, the guides are very informative, you can see the people in their traditional hanbok everywhere. Its a must do in SK."
3134,4.0,"The palace is still in good condition, and have a good view. You can see the ceremonial on guardians changing on 10am and you have chance to take a picture with the guardians. Unfortunately, there's some undermaintenance work in some area. Admission fee 3000₩/person."
3135,5.0,Gyeonbokkung is a beautiful palace for which the history dates back 1395. It has been extremely well refurbished. We visited with kids and they didn't feel bored at all. The palace is easily accessible by bus or subway.
3136,5.0,"It will take at least 2 hours to walk around this sprawling palace. Can get boring to towards the end as it is so big, so pace your visit accordingly. The central palace is really impressive, and busy. They were setting up for s[special event when visiting so didn't get to see everything. Also didn't visit the museum inside the palace grounds and fatigue was setting in."
3137,2.0,Nothing interest in this palace on September. May be I should come back in the winter. Snow should get everything better. Just a bit disappointment.
3138,5.0,"Interesting Palace, and good location. We were there for the changing of the Guard, and then joined the free guided tour of the palace and grounds. Very impressive and worth a visit."
3139,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace in the ancient palace in Seoul. It very easy to take MKT to the palace by drop off at Gyeongbokgung Station then walk follow the sign only 5 minutes.  There will be the entrance fee if you need to experience the interior. The palace is huge and attractive if we see from the outside. When we enter to the palace, it was crowded and difficult to find nice location for our best shot.  Recommend you to buy a ticket with local guide. If you buy only ticket then you would not know anything about this palace. There is no sign, no explanation then we could not get any knowledge from here.  Anyway, once in Seoul Trip recommend you to have a shot with the palace."
3140,5.0,"You can see the pure art of Joseon Dynasty. Some stupids always said that it is quite smaller than chinese or japanese palace and nothing impressive. Yes, it is true that Gyeongbokgung is 30% smaller than Beijing palace. So what? If you want to see just big palace just go to the north korea, there is world's biggest palace(Kim il sung palace). Chinise palaces were built on the massive flat ground just to show their power to the world. Japanese palaces were built to fight against the other clans. But Korean palaces, especially Gyeongbokgung, were considerd to make a harmony with mountains and waters. When you travel some hiatorical places, I recommend you to study the background information about that place."
3141,5.0,We visited the palace on a beautiful sunny day. It was beautiful the grounds and buildings are in great condition. We saw the changing of the guards which was great to see. Lots of people there had rented 'hanbok' the traditional style dresses to walk around the palace and get some great pictures in the beautiful scenery. I felt a little under dressed without one. Would deffinatley recommend renting them from nearby as we noticed after we had been around the palace. Worth a trip here.
3142,3.0,"The place is nice but it looks always the same, from the entrance to the center and surrounding . A small concert was on, and many girls were wearing typical korean old time dress, nice to see and to listen at . My young guide, a 15 yo volontaire , have been very kind . Very interesting to know that the floor heating have not been invented recently and probably not in Europe, ... no idea ."
3143,3.0,We had a great tour guide and he made the tour enjoyable but the palace was not as nice or as visually interesting as the one in Beijing. Since it was rebuilt recently it lacks the historical feel of other similar palaces. There is a lack of furniture for example in the rooms and the complex is half rebuilt.  I think it's worth a visit but definitely make sure you get a guide because I don't think it's very interesting if you're just walking around.
3144,5.0,"Very Interesting to understand how the medieval koreans lived. Also it shows how well preserved the palace has been kept. Its really cool to see the inner infrastructure of the rooms and quarters that the King , Queen and the maids lived in. The palace is massive and not really recommended for elderly and disabled tourists. It is definitely worth a go if you live around the area ! Its my second time here and would love to go again !"
3145,4.0,Make sure - before you visit this palace- that you know the times of the changing of the guards.Very colourful.
3146,4.0,"Very interesting to walk around with a guide to learn about the history. Architecture and designs are nice but because this was rebuilt, it doesn't have a high level of fascination (it's basically a replica).  Quickly make your way to the Museum to learn some interesting things."
3147,4.0,"This palace is closed on Tuesdays and costs W3000, unless you are 65 or over in which case entry is free.  A visit will last 1-2 hours depending on how much you want to see.  Free guided tours in English are available at specific times. Otherwise it is self-guided. There are notices in English but not everything is explained.  It is the biggest of the palaces in Seoul and has been much restored after having destroyed by fire, neglected or damaged by others during the 600 years since the oldest parts were built.  The buildings are set within lovely grounds and flower beds. There are two pavilions set within ponds which are particularly scenic.  Only downside is the small print in the information leaflet!  The palace is next to the National Palace Museum of Korea.  A must see in Seoul. Though note that many buildings are not lavishly furnished."
3148,4.0,This Palace was a great break from a long day of walking around the city. It was great to able to walk around and take in all of the history.
3149,5.0,"The most wanted bucket list, just turn on Gyeongbokgung Palace station, the directions very clear. you can rent Hanbok cross the street (Behind the Ticket entrance), if you using Hanbook (Rp. 150.000 - Rp. 200.000 for 1 hours and half) you don't need to buy the ticket again (Free), just entrance and explore the Palace as you want, I suggest all of you come in the morning, to see the Ceremony."
3150,4.0,It is impossible to get there and can only see from afar. But the scene here is quite peaceful and romantic
3151,2.0,"Comparing to palaces of same era in China or Japan, this is for us the least exciting. The grounds are not very well kept and parts of the palace are under renovation."
3152,5.0,"Having visited both, I would recommend Gyeongbokgung over Changdeokgung. The architecture is about the same at either palace, but I personally think Gyeongbokgung's mountainous backdrop is more breathtaking than Changdeokgung's secret garden (which I thought was overrated).  Try to visit during an off-peak time to avoid the crowds. I visited around 3 pm on a drizzly weekday afternoon and found the palace to be wonderfully uncrowded. The free English tour was a nice way to learn more about Korean history, but I also recommend taking the time to explore some of the more remote areas of the palace--the buildings are just as nicely restored and most people don't bother to walk that far in so it felt like I had the whole place to myself."
3153,5.0,"At first I didn't expect too much of it, I thought it was just an ordinary palace, like the ones I visited back in my country. However, when I set foot in the palace, I knew I was wrong. The palace was historical, huge, and marvelous. It's the kind of place that you can spend half a day there just to walk around and gaze upon the beauty of it.  You can also see soldier marching and try traditional Korean Hanbok there! P.S. The entrance fee will be free if you rent Hanbok there!"
3154,5.0,My family had a great time walking around the palace wearing the traditional Korean clothes and took a lot of photos. We were quite surprised to see how many dressed up like us. The solider performance at the main gate was neat. Great gift shop/cafeteria as it provides not only a place with AC for rest/drinks but offer many well made souvenirs. We were glad that we went in the morning because it started getting too hot in the afternoon. It was disappointing that the main pond/lake was under construction.
3155,4.0,"spare sometime if you want to throughly walk around the place. it can be overwhelming, but there's a free 30-minutes tour in english. look for schedule near the entrance from gwanghamun gate. personally i'm happy with just that, then spend more time in other palaces like changdeokgung (within walking distance from gyeongbukgung) which has prettier garden and pavilions in my opinion."
3156,3.0,"Probably the main palace in Seoul, very cheap entrance fees, large palace to go around, possibility to visit the seoul folk museum nearby for free"
3157,5.0,I like to visit this place again to get a good feel of the Korean culture. A must see to visit and experience.
3158,5.0,"A must see for any tourist visiting Seoul.  During the summer I recommend visiting the palace at night. You will need to make a reservation online (you'll find how to do that on their website royalpalace.go.kr), it's worth it. The views of the palace and the surrounding area are more scenic at night and the humid/hot summer weather is more bearable."
3159,5.0,"It was really great! The palace was very big, and I love the architecture inside the palace. Worth every penny. But, the palace a little bit crowded when you came on weekend."
3160,2.0,"We arrived expecting splendour in a Korean style. The buildings, of which many are restored recently, are very pretty and the setting is beautiful. But you can't enter almost all the buildings and apart from a big sign at each building there's little to provide an engaging context for grown ups and kids alike. Might have worked better if framed as a pretty stroll rather than a history/culture site. Also, the place is quite exposed so if you go on a sunny day with steering heat and small kids in tow I'd advise late afternoon."
3161,5.0,When touring Korea there are a lot of historical shrines and palaces to visit. If you only do one this is the one. Allow a couple of hours as it is extremely large and there is a lot to see. The authorities are continually restoring the palace and it is in great condition The entry fee is only a few dollars and well worthwhile English speaking guides are available While we missed it apparently the changing of the guards is a highlight The palace is also within walking distance to the Bukchon Hanoi village as well
3162,5.0,"I love Korea, love Seoul and Gyeongbokgung Palace. We could hire a hanbok and wore to take pictures with local guards and local citizens or even other tourists. Must visit place in Seoul xx"
3163,4.0,Great piece of history in a modern city! Many locals visit in traditional dress and interesting to see the changing of the guards.
3164,5.0,Great place to get sense on Korean history and architecture. I recommend this to all families that are interested in Korean history
3165,5.0,"Very nice place in the middle of the city. It is a well preserved and maintained piece of history. There are lots of tourists here, but due to the size it's still nice."
3166,5.0,"Everything is very interesting in Korea, it is not colorful like in Japan or China but still worth to see it. Do not forget to take umbrella as in June / July rains a lot!"
3167,4.0,This is a must visit when you are in Seoul. One of the biggest palaces in the city. You can really feel and smell the ancient history of Korea.
3168,5.0,"My husband and I actually went to see Gwanghwamun Gate (The main gate to the palace) under the night lights not realising the palace was open at night. After a couple photo's at the front we tentatively walked in and joined the short que for a ticket.  It wasn't that crowded to begin with and we were close to the front of the line when the gates opened. If your ever in the same position when the gates open, don't follow the crowd and walk straight. Walk to the left and through a side door. That was where the magic started for us. as it slowly got darker and the palace just became magical, the only thing that could have enhanced it is with fireflies (not possible, but it does let your imagination go.)  After that it becomes harder to fully enjoy the palace with so many people and children. So many people looking for the perfect selfie in front of everything. We went again to the first area at the end of our trek around the palace, but the magic was lost with the shear number of people there.  People forget about the history of the palace and what it has seen, it became a beautiful scene to take selfies before moving to the next beautiful scene. Not to say we didn't take any selfies, but we took a moment to read what little english text there was and to just imagine what it was like in that era."
3169,4.0,"If you like to know more about the old Korean Kingdom and see historical buildings, this is a place you should not miss. It is located in the city centre and it is advisable to take metro to go there because, if you drive there, you would have difficulty to park you car. Since the National Folklore Museum is just next door, you may wish to visit both the palace and the museum in one go. As the area is fairly large, please be prepared to allow at least a half day for this visit."
3170,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is reminiscent of Central Park in that it is situated in the middle of an enormous, loud city but allows for a level of peace and solitude that you wouldn't expect to find. Having been built originally in the 1300s, the palace is a shell of it;'s original self having been destroyed by the Japanese hundreds of years later. That being said, the majority of the building have likely been rebuilt but their beauty and attention to detail are remarkable. A must see while in Seoul."
3171,5.0,"among all the place I visited in Korea, this is the place I love the most. A great historical Palace which very beautiful and well maintained."
3172,4.0,Dressed in hanbok at the Gyeongbokgung to commemorate our wood anniversary #5thanniversary! Thank you #seohwahanbok for the glamorous hankok and memorable photos....! 👍❤❤ So much fun to join in the local youngsters in this #newtrend during springbreak and take group pictures with them!
3173,5.0,We visited here and took an English tour. It's really worth you time to see and hear about the history of Place and Kings in Korea.
3174,5.0,The palace is incredably huge. (TIPS) We went to the hanbok rental and got free entry ticket because we use hanbok. People were staring at our group (8 of us walking together with hanbok) but hey we got to take good pictures in hanbok as well.  The entrance to the center part is quite the same. Don't take to much time taking picture outside as the inside parts have less people around. Don't forget to come in to the lake. It was beautiful and breathtakingly pretty.
3175,4.0,The palace was one of the palaces lived by the king of Korea. It is a much smaller version of Forbidden City of China. The palace has been somewhat destroyed by Japanese in past. Several areas of the palace are rebuilt just few years ago.
3176,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace, or the Northern Palace is a sprawling place with beautiful gardens surrounding it. We were fortunate to come on a pleasant August day where people were dressed in traditional clothing (hanbok) and taking photos together. A very nice day out. Don't miss the Museum right next door."
3177,5.0,My son and I enjoyed every corner of this Gyeongbokgung Palace. On our 1st visit we arrived 30mins before closing and missed opportunity to tour through the majority of the palace complexes. We loved it so much and decided to return next day for 10:30am for English Tour Guide through Secret Garden. It was worth it.
3178,5.0,"Beautiful palace, very large, cheap entry fee, lovely views and gardens, very peaceful. Convenient entry from metro station."
3179,5.0,"very nice grounds, love these types of places. if you like history, then you must visit the palace. k?"
3180,5.0,We had a great time strolling around the grounds of the palace.  Lots of nice pmaces to pise for a pucture. Fun to people watch as people rent Korean dress when visiting the palace. Very nice gift shop too.
3181,3.0,"Similar to the other palaces, just bigger and a little more elaborate. Doesn't compare to the palaces in Forbidden City. We had volunteer staff give us a tour. Exhibit information at points of interest would have been helpful."
3182,5.0,"It was really amazing to visit such a beautiful place in the middle of the city Seoul. I thought it was really interesting how both traditional and modern life coexist together in a city. The traditional clothes, Hanbok, that everyone wore are so pretty and I am sad that I didn't know much about the rental information. Maybe I should try next time.  It is a must visit place and you won't regret!"
3183,5.0,Step back into time and walk the massive palace grounds right in the middle of Seoul. See the secret island where the king relaxed with his lady. Take pictures in front of the party pavilion. See the magnificent throne room View the building where hangul was invented.
3184,5.0,It is an amazing place....just the peace and the beauty in the middle of the city. It is worth it to visit
3185,5.0,"قصر جميل جدا ويجب الذهاب له ، قبل القصر يوجد متحف مجاني الدخول ، كثير من الزوار يلبسون الهانبوك والزي التقليدي لأخذ الصور فيه ولأنك ان لبسته فالدخول للقصر مجاني Beautiful palace, although we miss the show when the guards martch with music? We came last second, it keeps showing but wasn't sure every what, You can enter free if you dress in tradition oitfit which places near provide them for rent."
3186,4.0,"This is a very nice palace. The further back you go, the less crowded it gets. Loved the changing of the guards. Like a little Forbidden City with its layout."
3187,5.0,This is one of the must see sites in Seoul. There are guards out the front who do a kind of changing of the guard. Inside you have a few palaces with descriptions of each one. With both locals and tourists dressed in local hanbuk clothes it makes this place feel like a step back in time and from a historical Korean tv show. Nice pavilion on a lake in the middle. Takes around an hour to walk around. Worth seeing.
3188,4.0,"It is an excellent place to see and take many photos with beautiful royal scenery behind, especially wearing the historical hanbok and wearing the hanbok can enter the royal palace without fee. We entered from the North gate and started to take pictures in front of the halls, corriders, gardens, ... within the four hours rental period and visited the Korean Culture Gallery where we knew bit by bit the Korean culture systematically. We were lucky that we could watch the royal parade around noon time."
3189,5.0,A good reconstruction of an ancient palace.  Extensive building and forecourt  The loos in the museum are good too 😉
3190,5.0,There is a lot to see at this Palace. It is like a palace and the forbidden city rolled into one. The changing of the guard is really worth looking at. It is interesting to hear the history of the palace though I would not want to be around during when it was occupied.
3191,3.0,It's as the title says. I think it's something that is worth the visit but there are nicer palaces to be seen.
3192,5.0,"The Palace grounds are huge, there is a lot to see. Many of the areas are open for pictures. The museum was the best part I enjoyed as well as the show in the court yard."
3193,5.0,"One of the best place i ever went, it really exceeded my expectation, as im a fan of korean drama. Plus wearing there traditional Hanbok it makes you feel that your in Joseon Dynasty Era."
3194,5.0,"We purchased the Palace Combo pass which included entry to all 4 palaces plus Jongmyo Shrine. This Palace is huge and requires at least half a day to see it all. There are changing of the guard ceremonies on several times throughout the day and also a chance to dress in traditional costumes. There is a tea house in the far back corner of the Palace grounds and a cafe inside the Folk Museum (which is worthy of your time), but apart from that, not many options for food/drink. Gardens are extensive. Take plenty of water."
3195,5.0,"This palace is centrally located, beautiful both day and night, accessible to all. The history is fantastic and you should check out the museum next door as well."
3196,3.0,"It is a large complex, like a big park, with several buildings. You need at least 2 hours to go through them all and in the severe heat of the summer, it is quite exhausting. The buildings all look more or less alike. The main building is supposed to be the Gyoenghoeru Pavillion, which is not impressive. Very little or no information is given, at least not in English, which is shameful. However, this is the largest palace in Seoul and the complex is the most important tourist attraction ao it is a must see."
3197,4.0,"Massive-would be my first reaction to this place. It is a place that you should visit in Seoul to appreciate some histories, traditional Korean architecture and garden. There were a lot of tourists there but the place is so spread out so you won't feel that it's too cramped in there. ( at least the day I was there ). Prepare to spend about 2 hours if you would like to walk it all. There is locker area near the main gate but I recommend taking your belonging with you because there are other gates that you can exit as you walk deeper into the property. And from those gate you can easily walk to other attractions. In summer, bring along umbrella and water."
3198,4.0,This ia must see as it contains lots of history and beautiful Korean architecture. You will need to spend minimum half a day here to even just do most of the area. Longer if you want to go into the details.
3199,5.0,The palace is huge and rather amazing that is located in the middle of a bustling city. One can feel the history and culture by just being there. Worth the visit.
3200,4.0,One of the best place in Korea. Hire Hanbok so that you don't have to buy ticket!! I had a really great time here!
3201,4.0,"Seoul is definitely not all about just shopping!  I went to Seoul for a Year-end holiday with 2 friends and we decided to visit Gyeongbokgung on the first day of 2017. It was a very grand palace with very nice scenery! We took our time to slowly walk around, embracing ourselves in the cultural air. There were many tourists too, well, in fact, a bit too many! It was rather difficult to take any photos without some people ""photo-bombing"" our photos! Well, I guess that can't be helped! Anyway I love watching some ladies wearing the traditional hanboks and taking photos. When we realised that we can rent hanbok, my friend went to rent one immediately and we had fun taking photos and having fun! I would strongly recommend to visit this Palace if you have time in Seoul."
3202,3.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is LARGE! very, very large. the grounds go on forever and it's size and history is fasinating. They also have fantastic free tour guides that you can book online. However I would probably recommend visiting Changdeokgung Palace instead. Most of Gyeongbokgung Palace was destroyed during the war and is being restored from the ground up to resemble what it would have been like ""back in the day"" so to me it felt a little bit like walking through a theme park. Changdeokgung Palace on the other hand is a world heritage listed site and maintains a lot of it's original structures, it also has a wonderful garden ""secret garden"" that is a favourite for many Seoulites."
3203,5.0,Great museum and Hongboks are a must. Go across the road and deck the kids with hongboks and do the tour. Changing of the guard is interesting.
3204,4.0,Very easy to get to and very reasonable entrance fee. I went to see the changing of the guard...which got rained out but it's a nice place to see history in the heart of the city.
3205,5.0,"Wonderful Palace with nominal entrance fee., free cultural shows daily . on the orange metro line #3, close to Us Embassy, city hall and other palaces and museums"
3206,4.0,A beautiful and colorful place that I wished to discover since long time ago!! Got back in the korean History
3207,3.0,"This was very disappointing and says a lot about major sights in Korea and China.  Extremely grand and a wonderful photo opportunity as you will see many people using it. Unfortunately there is no content or real history here. The temple is completely gutted and the buildings become very samey, very quickly.  A nice walk but not much to see or learn here."
3208,4.0,"It was quite hot when we visited the palace. The sun was very glaring when we stood there watching the changing of guards parade. But it was interesting. The palace is very big, very nice structures. We are a group of 10 people so can get cheaper entrance rates. Those who wear hanbok, (the korean costume) think can enter free of charge. Nice to see people wearing hanbok at the palace."
3209,5.0,This is one of the largest palaces in seoul..you can rent a hanbok the traditional costume of Koreans while you are sightseeing..very beautiful place.. definitely recommend it
3210,5.0,"This palace is extraordinary! What a beauty. I was amazed how big this place is when I got in. There's a lot to see. I'm Korean, so I'm very proud at the fact that my ancestors built this palace. It's definitely a must see when you are in Seoul. Don't leave without seeing this place!"
3211,5.0,"I often travel to The Philippines and have at least an 8-hour layover in Seoul. This gives me limited time to grab a bus into the city, eat and check out the sites. Gyeongbokgung Palace is a terrific site to behold. From the guards out front dressed in the style of a bygone era to the magnificent architecture of the buildings. Thank goodness for digital photography, because you will definitely have many photos opportunities here. I recommend that anyone like me who might have limited site-seeing time to stop here first, as this is the Korea you really need to see. Enjoy."
3212,5.0,Spent half a day visiting the whole palace. The biggest palace and we thoroughly Enjoyed our visit 👍
3213,4.0,Beautiful to just walk around here and take photos next to the buildings. The entrance fee was cheap.
3214,5.0,"Amazing palace grounds with a vaierty of temples, which reminded me of a smaller version of the Forbidden City in Beijing. Tip: Get there when it opens at 9: no crowds and the weather cooler."
3215,5.0,"I really enjoyed my time in this beautiful place. Entrance fee is 3000 kwn, if you want you can get a free English tour (11.am., 3.30pm) There are also Korean national dresses for rent, you can rent it out and stay your visit wearing this dress. It reminds me at some point forbidden city in Beijing but with way more greenery, beautiful ponds, less people and way more space. If you like museums don't forget to pass by national folk museum, it's right next to the palace."
3216,3.0,"Found it to be only soso ,all looked the same and there is nothing in the buildings,though the muesum is very good"
3217,5.0,"My brother and I arrived at the gates of Gyeongbokgung Palace, on a sunny December morning. Exhausted from our debate on how to properly pronounce 'Gyeongbokgung', we were instantly silenced upon being greeted by two stone sculptures. Was it a hairless lion, or a mythical beast? Something to debate as we explored the palace further.  Royal Guards dressed in traditional uniforms, swarmed in as we walked through one of three large red doors. Their spears pierced the heavens as they marched towards us in a ceremonial fashion. It was an amazing transition from the busy, modern streets behind the red gates of the palace; like stepping back in time. Alarmed at first, we were relieved to learn it was only the opening of the palace gates that we nearly interrupted.  After a pleasant ceremony feature, we proceeded through the massive courtyard, at the entrance, to the ticket booths. The ground was soft. The sand filling the courtyard was fine and yellowish orange in colour. I was fascinated by how comfortable it was to walk on it. I dimwittedly thought there was nothing more to the palace, beyond the courtyard. That was until we advanced further in through the palace's second second gates.  We spent 2.5 hours wandering the grounds of Gyeongbokgung Palace, discovering amazing detail in architecture, beautiful natural scenery, and a taste of Korea's history and culture through the people we encountered an learning about the demolition and restoration of the palace.  It was not too busy, but if you are trying to capture tourist free photos, you may have to be patient for the perfect moment :D I enjoyed viewing the city, which towered over the walls of the palace, from within the center of the palace. It was an exciting place to be; almost like viewing the future while standing in the past.  If you are Palace, Temple, Castle, etc. hoping throughout East Asia, do not miss this palace. There is also plenty to see and do around the palace if you have time to spare in Seoul."
3218,5.0,Stunning Historical Place. Absolutely beautiful. Highly recommended. you will spend at least 2-3 hours in this palace. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes.
3219,5.0,Wonderful opportunity to experience a piece of history in the heart of Seoul! Very popular destination. Be prepared to stay for a few hours to really enjoy the amazing architecture and nature that grace the area. Also check for current opening and closing times before you head out.
3220,3.0,Just what's it says it is. A large palace with interesting architecture. Be sure to time your visit for the changing of the guard
3221,5.0,It is well worth it to visit the palace for the night opening. The lighting and the atmosphere are very beautiful.  Make sure you bring your passport or id to get the reduced entry fee.
3222,5.0,"I had only one day in Seoul that time and I wanted to visit something, which represents the city and Korean culture. I chose the Gyeongbokgug Palace. I was lucky as they have free entrance on the last Wednesday of the month. It was a nice surprise! The palace is magnigicent! Of course, it is better to know more about it history, but even if you don't, it is a nice place to walk and discover, to forget all the troubles and just walk and enjoy the beauty of pavillions. There were many young people in national dresses, it gives this place even more magic and brings you somewhere centuries ago."
3223,4.0,We were lucky to have met the ICI youth Cultural Corp volunteer. They provided us with a afternoon of informative tour of the palace. And all the information and friendliness are for free!!
3224,4.0,"Paying only 3,000 KRW each for entrance fee and you will be able to explore such a great palace -- free of charge when you are dressed in traditional Hanbok. All manmade architecture and decoration are well-presented! Soldier marching is interesting! Folk Village with performance inside is awesome! The most outstanding place to stop over before heading to other places!"
3225,5.0,"I had a wonderful time at the Gyeongbokgung palace.Korean history is absolutely fascinating! You can see the influence of Confucianism in the architecture and aesthetics, but the Gyeongbokgung palace is a testimony to the fact that simplicity is both powerful and beautiful! The ceremony of changing of guards is definitely recommended!"
3226,5.0,"We went with Hanbok, and have a nice experience in this historical palace. The architecture is nice, with some guard in the traditional wear patrolling the palace. Overall it was an enjoyable experience. PS: entrance is free for anyone in Hanbok."
3227,5.0,"A personal favorite of all the palaces. It was pouring with rain the day we went, and it still did not disappoint. Lovely gardens and architecture, with the mountains in the background."
3228,5.0,"I enjoy my visit to this palace. You need to get an excellent guide to orientate you around the palace or else everything doesn't really make sense and all you see are just buildings and more buildings. I had a great Korean guide, June who made the tour enjoyable. She even point to us minor details that tourists fail to see.  It used to be really grand and there, you will see a portrait of it being even more majestic than before. Sadly, majority of the buildings were destroyed during the Japanese Invasion. Restorations are still taking place.  The fun part is the changing of guard ceremony. I think it's a normal ritual in every palace but since we are living in modern time, it's quite fascinating. You can take photos with the guides too.  If you know Feng Shui, I was told that this palace was deliberately built around 4 mountains. The mountain behind the palace was Bukhansan, a very beautiful mountain!  I enjoy this visit. Love the pictures!"
3229,5.0,"When you visit Gyeongbokgung Palace and decided to rent Hanbok before entering, congrats! Your admission to the palace will be free!  The palace is so big and well preserved. It is also a great place to observe the changing of guards and experience their traditional costume. So close to their national museum and bukchon village."
3230,5.0,"No matter you are korean or foreigner, I strongly recommend to visit this place if you are in seoul. You can see the beauty of korean traditional architecture. Also, you can borrow a pair of korean traditional clothes(hanbok) near here. so, it will be memorable experience to walking around here with hanbok."
3231,4.0,"We were on a ship's tour with this Palace as one of the stops. Amazing to see all the different buildings and the way the Korean Royalty lived. Many young people come, dressed in traditional garb to enjoy the day here. Adds authenticity to the viewing of the buildings and grounds."
3232,4.0,Place to see in Seoul quite and beautiful Temples are simple and in line with Korean culture with style and harmony
3233,5.0,"It is a must for anyone to visit while in the Seoul. I visted with the pre-organised guided tour, purchsed at viator.com. It included the visit to palace , information about it and plenty of free time to look around and take images."
3234,5.0,Was rainy when I went so the views weren't the greatest. However the compound inside the castle is very well kept.
3235,3.0,We prefered the Changgyeonggung palace over this one. Because everyone goes here making it bussier. Also the grounds and buildings are not as beautiful as in the other palace. The changing of the guards felt like a themepark schtick with fake goatees and everything. It has some impressive buildings but it did not make a lasting impression on us.
3236,3.0,"Nice to see, shows but bring cash If you want to se the Hole area. Good food in the restaurant and good service"
3237,4.0,"If u wish to catch the guard changing ceremony, better come early & check the timing. Beautiful scenery & make sure to walk all around the place."
3238,4.0,"The Palace is great - the entry fee isn't expensive 3000 won - group is 2400 won for 10 people above. I think audio guide is about 1000 won. If 4 palace ticket is 10,000 won and valid for 3 months. At the entrance is the Palace museum which is free of charge and a must. You can spend almost all day here - Start off at the museum - have some lunch, and then go explore the palace. There are traditional hanbok dressing for rent around the palace. You can just take a picture outside if you do not want to walk however if you want to explore the entire place it will take 2 - 3 hours and alot of walking. There is a free palace tour every day i think about 11 and 1 pm. Check the schedule again in case it changes."
3239,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is an elegant palace with beautiful pavilion on a pond (Gyeonghoeru), and had been the home for many Yi Dynasty kings. Inside the palace compound is National Palace Museum of Korea with informative displays worth visiting. The admission ticket to Gyeongbokgung Palace includes visit to this museum. You can visit this palace by Metro Line 3. Get off at Gyeongbokgung stop, and follow ""Gyeongbokgung Palace"" exit sign (Exit 5) to reach the palace compound. Turn right upon getting out of the metro exit, and walk all way the across the big palace ground to the ticket office. At the ticket office, buy your admission ticket for the palace. Seniors from foreign countries are eligible for half-price admission when a proof of age such as passport or driver's license is shown to the ticket agent at the ticket window. Once you enter the palace inner court by presenting your palace admissions ticket at the entrance, you can wander around the palace ground with historical palace buildings. You can visit the palace halls, and walk to the beautiful pavilion on a pond (Gyeonghoeru). On the palace ground, you will come across many young people wearing colorful Korean costume (Hanbok) making you feel as if you have embarked on a time travel to the past. Many of these young people wearing Korean costume (Hanbok) are tourists who are wearing rented costumes, because five major palaces in Seoul waive admission fees to those wearing Korean costumes. Hanbok can be rented for a relatively low price from many shops at Eulji-ro Underground Shopping Center, located near Myeong-dong and Jongno. You can view the changing of guards ceremony on the outer compound where the ticket office is located. On the way out, you can also visit the National Palace Museum of Korea near the metro station entrance."
3240,5.0,A must visit palace to learn more about the history of Korea and their historical dispute with Japan.
3241,5.0,we were staying near seoul station. took a taxi and within 5-10 minutes we reached this palace on 30 June. Spent a couple of hours. saw the gaurd changing ceremony. explored every corner of the palace. lots of travellers were there who were wearing the local dresses to take a picture. We loved this place.
3242,5.0,"I love everything about this palace. I explored every corner of this palace and I think this palace is amazing. I went in November 2016, it was fall and quite cool. Rented Hanbok ($45 for 12 hours) and went all over places wearing it. It was my most precious experience and I will surely do it again in the future!!"
3243,4.0,When visiting Seoul you have to visit one of the palaces. Sadly most of them didn't survive however they been beautifully rebuilt. I strongly recommend taking a guided tour otherwise the purpose of the structures and grounds is lost. Be sure to plan your visit during the changing of the guards ceremony to see the beautiful uniforms and 'parade.'
3244,5.0,This palace has a lovely moat which makes it more attractive than some of the others. It also has a traditional change of the guard ceremony that is worth timing your visit around as it is quite a spectacle.
3245,5.0,This place is a must for all travellers. Come early before 9am for the changing of guards. When we went here there was a flea market outside the palace grounds where you can buy the traditional Hanbok at costs similar to rentals. So check first the market outside.
3246,5.0,"I enjoyed the place, including those people wearing the hanbok dresses though so many tourist can't do al with picture taking"
3247,5.0,"A must-visit for tourist visiting Seoul. South Korea's historical landmark. We were able to watch the Royal Guard Changing Ceremonies, it was awesome. The place is huge, don't forget to bring your umbrella with you during summer and rainy months."
3248,5.0,We took an English guided tour that they have. Tour starts in front of Gyeongbokgung Palace Information Center inside the Heungnyemun Gate. Definitely gave us a better understanding of what we are seeing. The guide speak very good English. One thing I would highly recommend is to bring an umbrella during hot sunny Summer days since it's an hour tour. There is a cafe inside as well after the tour ends as you walks towards the exit direction.
3249,5.0,"This place is good to visit when there is no sun, avoid summer and also winter. spring and autumn the best. There is a museum that you can visit and it's free on the west exit. This place is big and has a mountain background that is good to take picture with. You can rent hanbok or korean traditional clothes and visit this place to add that special feels.  check out my youtube channel~ search by title: #6 TRAVEL BLOG DAY 5 SEOUL - CULTURAL DAY"
3250,5.0,impressive. love the guards ceremony. a must go. pity we did not wear the hanbok ..it would have been perfect if we wear the hanbok & take photos against the palace.
3251,3.0,"it was big, thats it. there were no guidance. good to take photo with, but you can get bored easily."
3252,5.0,"I arrived in time for the changing of the guards. What an amazing spectacle with a parade of guards in their colourful Korean uniforms, marching in formation carrying different coloured flags that fluttered in the breeze. Then the main event of horns and conchs being played as a a parade of guards filled the forecourt for the change over. Definitely a unique ceremony not to be missed. I spent a number of hours exploring the Palace which has many buildings, each different and the lovely gardens. Was a real pleasure to see many Koreans dressed in traditional Hanbok clothing that added to the ambience of the Palace. So many photo opportunities particularly of the architecture and the backdrop of the mountains behind. A highlight of my Korean visit."
3253,4.0,This place is big. Be prepared to spend a few hours if you really want to explore each corner including the royal kitchen. Many tourists put in the traditional clothes n the ladies look great in the hanbok. Picturesque with lots of history. Worth the visit.
3254,5.0,"like the title, this is one of my favorite place in seoul. its beautiful throghout four seasons,, nice to walk around. They open at night two times a year. Spring and Fall about two weeks each. The entrance ticket sold out like in one minute for night entrance, but if u r foreigner they have extra ticket available at site. so much more possibility to enter. special lights makes the palace extraordinary . must try!"
3255,5.0,Visited the royal palace on a Sunday. Lots of people about taking in the beautiful weather with clear blue skies. It was fantastic to see many young Koreans in traditional dress at the palace. I was by myself so took my time in looking around
3256,5.0,"This was an excellent place the visit. We saw some beautiful architecture, gardens, and sculptures. I would recommend though that you do a walking tour, which is free. We did not have time but I think we would have learnt more if we had done one."
3257,4.0,"Palace site is very big, it took us about half-day to explore it. The architecture of the palace and the surrounding buildings are very interesting, the garden inside the palace itself provides some shades during hot day. The free museum visit at the entrance of this palace should definitely worth a visit."
3258,5.0,This takes you to the times that were...make sure you have a good tour guide. We were with a great group and got to see this as well as the change of guard
3259,5.0,"There aren't many places in Asia where a city would sacrifice so much land in the middle of the central district to history. Seoul is a city where technology is perhaps is currently at the forefront of the world and yet they respect their rich history and display this to visitors from all over the globe. Make sure you work your time table around to see the change of guard (every two hours I think). Gwanghwamun, Heungnyemun and Gyeongbokgung are all located in the same area. One ticket will allow access to both Palaces. For those keen you can also change into Hanbok to walk around the area.  Recommend checking the weather before heading there lot of open areas to walk through avoid rainy days if possible."
3260,5.0,We enjoyed the palace very much. It is very large and it takes a while to go through. There are many great locations to take photos. This is a must see location in Seoul!
3261,4.0,"I went to the palace with my brother and I was amazing .. looked similar to forbidden city in Beijing in the beginning but then it was different.. the weather was nice also mild rain on and off and not too hot. There was a part of the palace near where the king use to take a boat trip where you can't visit unless u booked a day before, unfortunately I couldn't go there. I enjoyed my time there a lot, strongly recommend it"
3262,5.0,Gyeongbokgung Palace is a place of pride for Koreans. I've been to this historical site several times over the years. I highly recommend taking a tour through the grounds.
3263,5.0,First make sure you get to see the Guard ceremony we got lucky and just happened to get their right when it began. Allow yourself time to explore its big and you will find a lot of locals dressed in traditional garb getting pictures. Take you time and enjoy it is very special
3264,5.0,It is so big! You can also see the Blue House out of one of their exits (liken it to the white house). Our children wanted to dress like Korean princess so we hired Hanboks for them. It is a must do. It makes it all a little more magical.
3265,4.0,"I went here in the afternoon with my friends. Just stop at Anguk Station and check the exact exit # so that you will not get lost. Actually, if you are not k drama fanatic you will not admire the place. It will take you at least 1 hour to take pictures and go around the area, you can just walk to the other exit of the Palace going to Bukchon Village, just ask the guard for the direction."
3266,4.0,Going there around november 2014. Quite impressing when the guards changing shift. The ritual took about 15 minutes. Heritage sites thats instagramable feels like in joseon era. I heard they lend some costume for take picture but dunno not doing it..
3267,5.0,Intriguing palace and a nice introduction to the Korean culture. Fun to walk about and explore the buildings.
3268,4.0,"Took a tour on a hot day. It was ok. Rented a aoudio guide. It did the job. Easy to go around with. The place is beautiful , building and gardens. There sevral cultural shows during the day."
3269,5.0,"Was very impressed by this palace and the park. The president's palace is just behind the park, so it makes it even more worth the visit."
3270,3.0,"I can see why people would think this place is great. Especially for history buffs, but it's just not for me. It feels similar to Beijing's Tian An Men."
3271,4.0,"I joined a free guided tour which helped me to appreciate some things that I would normally have overlooked. It's a shame that so much of it was destroyed at various times in the past, but it was impressive nontheless and well worth a visit."
3272,4.0,Honestly it looks a lot like Chinese palace with lesser stuffs It's big enough and a must see but then it was an ok place for me In front of the palace are expensive food and nothing special about it Just a must see then but not a must stay in the area
3273,5.0,"Went here on a hot day in June. It was pretty cool to see. I'm by no means a history buff or even that into cultural things, but I can appreciate the history of this palace. I think its a must-see if you're in Seoul!"
3274,5.0,I love it.. If you love Historic places you will love this place many good place to see and to learn about Korean culture and history.. The the emperor and royal family .. Also there are a museum.. Good place to take your child with you to see and to learn from.. And infant can also enjoy as there are a special area for children and mother to rest and to enjoy the time with educational playground and game
3275,5.0,"One of the main attraction and iconic site of the city, a very big complex with many historical palace, residences, pavilions and halls. There's free guided English tours at specific times and also don't miss the changing guard ceremony, a must see 👍"
3276,4.0,A must try when in korea. A lot of people wearing hanbok and taking pictures. For peopleqho wants to take beautiful picture its a nice place to visit
3277,5.0,The changing of the guard ceremony is really good and costumes are so colorful. The precision of the performance is just perfect. The palace is amazing and buildings are intricate in design. Such a pleasant walk amongst real history.
3278,5.0,We had a great time going through the Gyeongbokgung Palace. The history was quite interesting.  We thoroughly enjoyed the museum.
3279,4.0,"A smaller version of Beijing's forbidden city. Not so old in reality given it seems to have been ravaged by Japanese occupation at least twice but the city is trying to restore to its former glory. So much history there but not much by way of signage to indicate the role and purpose of many of the buildings, how life was lived in the palaces and grounds. Very few photos of what it looked in its heyday before the modern city of Seoul swamped its grandure."
3280,5.0,I visited this palace in May.. Its beautiful and very well preserved. You need plenty of time to walk around the palace and enjoy the beauty.
3281,5.0,"We rented the hanbok (the traditional outfit) and walked around the palace. It felt like you were part of a Korean drama. It was fun and the place is surprisingly huge, so were your comfortable shoes."
3282,4.0,"It nice for sure. But when you walk into it for a few hours, you realised many buildings are the same and start to get bored"
3283,4.0,"Lovely stroll in the afternoon, beautiful greenery, not crowded at all.. definitely worth the visit!"
3284,2.0,"We visited the palace today. Arrived about 1030 and paid our $14,000 won. We were able to easily walk around the site and whilst there was some fascinating features in the roof of the buildings and beautiful parkland surrounds the feature were the mountains in the background.  We were then lucky enough to see the changing of the guard ceremony as we were leaving.  The visit was an ok experience but would have survived without it.  A 6/10 experience."
3285,5.0,"This palace is the first one in the list of must-see destinations in Seoul. If you want to get a full immersion into the Korean culture I strongly advise to rent a Hanbok (traditional Korean dress) and walk around the palace in it. Btw, the entrance to the palace is free if you're wearing Hanbok, and it is relatively cheap to rent one- around W20,000 for 2 hours."
3286,5.0,The Korean palaces are excellent stops when touring Seoul. Great stories of kings and history in Korea. Architecture is fascinating and worth taking time to enjoy. Amazing how the palaces are positioned inside a modern city and how they have been preserved for visitors.
3287,5.0,Gyeongbokgung palace so beautiful. The place so clean and well groomed. It's best place for take a photo. You must visit here if you go to Seoul
3288,4.0,"Highly recommend a visit to this grand and beautiful palace. Many young (and old) ladies were wearing hanboks and taking photos around the palace grounds (you can rent a hanbok inside the palace grounds, or you can rent one from one of the stores just west of the palace entrance). We didn't catch the changing of the guards, but we still enjoyed taking photos around the palace. We stayed at the Four Seasons hotel, and it was a nice 10-minute stroll from the hotel. Even the kids enjoyed the vast open space. We stayed at Gyeongbokgung for less than an hour as we had a dinner to catch, but you can easily spend more time here."
3289,3.0,"The place is vast but nothing impressive/memorable. The palace looks newly built rather than a historical site.Lots of vast , sandy open areas. The gardens are very boring and ameteurish. Didn't find it interesting or memorable. Seen much more impressive historical sites in Asia than this. Japan has much better and more impressive historical site. If you don't have much time in Seoul, can skip this."
3290,3.0,"Not for everyone. If you get tired of seeing the same structures repeatedly, visiting just this palace would do. You can skip the other palaces and go straight to shopping or other activities."
3291,5.0,A wonderful look at the lifestyle several 100 years ago. It is amazing to watch the changing of the guard ceremony.
3292,4.0,"No visit to Seoul is complete without a visit to the iconic Gyeongbokgung Palace. This is the main royal palace of the 500 years old Joseon Dynasty. With a name (Gyeong-Bok) that literally means brilliance and fortune, this palace does not flatter to deceive. With an internal compound that is as grand as the Forbidden Palace in Beijing, it would take you a good 2 hours to cover all grounds within the palace. The many tourists walking the grounds dressed in traditional Korean costume (hanbok) which are rented from the nearby shops, helps create an atmosphere from the bygone Joseon Dynasty days. I only wish more of the interior rooms could be opened up to give visitors a glimpse into how the King and his royal escorts live their lives back then. Finally, don't forget to visit the 2 adjacent free museums - National Folk Museum and National Palace Museum - to complete your time travel back to the Joseon Dynasty."
3293,5.0,"A place where I felt the history and culture of Korea. From the Royal Guard ceremony at the entrance gate to the pavilions and gazebos inside the palace, it left me breathless, speechless and amazed. My favorite place so far in Seoul."
3294,4.0,It was great to go through the various palace areas which were well described and the maps did a great job of explaining the various structures ---Liked the place
3295,3.0,"We visited as part of a tour on a very hot day… so I was somewhat anxious to do a quick visit then leave. If you are into history and seeing temples and palaces, this will probably be worthwhile. Personally, I found it somewhat boring."
3296,4.0,"This is a historical monument which is conserved well. If you want to take a photo with the traditional costume - Hanbok in the Palace, you can rent at many shops outside, around the Palace ( you must ask for the price before renting). And, if you wear the Hanbok, you haven't to pay for the ticket. The Palace is large with the traditional, feature architecture and landscape design. Hope you will enjoy this place!"
3297,5.0,"I never went to palace before.This is my first experience and we loved it even we didn't explore palace further more because we did bring two strollers but this place definitely most go when we visit Seoul.We are in seoul right now.Summer but wind was chilling so we didnt even feel like we are in summer season.Gyeongbokgung palace also very accessible using subway ""Gyeongbokgung""."
3298,5.0,"Steeped in history and beauty, this massive historical complex is being tastefully restored. The free guided tours will bring this place to life as they steer you through the characters and events which makes this a first class experience. English 1030 and 1530 lasts about 70 minutes and well worth it. Beautifully illuminated at night and worth the return visit. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
3299,5.0,"If you are in Seoul, it is one of the places you have to drop by. Historical palace and you can see many people with korean traditional custom."
3300,4.0,"We spent a total of about 2 hrs walking around here. The taxi driver dropped us off at the side entrance by the culture museum so that's where we started.  The whole palace here is not very big, so doesn't take very long to walk through. Since we came through the side, we weren't able to join a free tour either. So unfortunately there was not much explanation minus what was mentioned briefly on the map. I do wish they had signs or something up in each area so you're not just staring and walking blindly.  There is a lot of construction going on right now so you'll see a lot of white fences up, which unfortunately blocked visiting any of the over water structures. That was a bit disappointing but understandable.  If the timing works, I do recommend catching the catching of the guards performance. They don't need real guard any more these days so it's more of a show than the real stuff like at Buckingham, but was still fun to watch for 15 min. Then you can go take pictures with them.  Given a lot of similar structures and building styles, I can't stop comparing this to the Forbidden City. Gyeongbokgung is just not as large or grand and therefore did not seem as impressive to me. But still worthy of a visit."
3301,5.0,So many palaces in Seoul and decided to visit this one. Really made the right choice as amazed by the beautiful sceneries. Entry fee is 3000 won for adult.
3302,4.0,"One of the places we visited to learn more about the history of Seoul, You can also visit the museum next door."
3303,4.0,"Gyeongbukgong is the largest palace in Seoul and is a must visit attraction. And most popular which means lots of tourist. You must get there before 10 am so as to watch the changing of the guards. Great for taking pictures. But if want to see history, you must not miss this palace and all the grounds."
3304,5.0,Perfect for cultural exposure. Big field with old historical monuments and small waterstreams between houses. Good for any tourist who looks for understanding into korean tradition and history
3305,5.0,"To learn the history (even it is related to recent 600 years only) and King's life, it is highly recommended to visit this palace."
3306,3.0,"Awesome architecture, wonderful performance. The place is huge, lots of tourist. Near to Bukchon Hanok Village, walking distance."
3307,5.0,It's grand and really huge. So happy to finally see it coz we've been seeing it only in Kdramas. It's huge so I suggest to wear comfy shoes. There's a lot of hanbok rentals nearby to complete the experience. Plus you can enter the palaces for free if you're wearing a hanbok.
3308,4.0,"Get off from Gyeongbokgung Station exit 5 you walk directly to the park of Gyeongbokgung palace.very huge place.free entry if you wear Hanbok,korean traditional outfit.you can rent 15,000₩/person for 4 hours at the shop near the Palace.  You can take some picts in the palace area..but you cant enter the palace..in the outside of palace we will meet the guard.the changing guard will be taken at 11am.  You can cross the street and walk to Gwanghwamun Area.There's a park and museum of King Jeoson who discover Hangeul.Interesting museum..you must go there...free entry."
3309,5.0,This was one of my favorite historic sites to see in Seoul. I would recommend seeing this for yourself. Some of the women dress up in Hanbok to take photos inside. Near local subways stations or you can catch a cab.
3310,4.0,"There are several palaces in Seoul opened to the public. Gyeongbokgung is perhaps one of the more popular. Comparatively it does have more interesting structure. Of all the palaces I visit, Gyeongbokgung has activities that bring Korean culture closer to the visitors. Overall definitely one of the palace you should visit if palaces is on your agenda."
3311,5.0,"This is a huge palace that has been restored by a fire in the past. If you exit from the train station Gwanghwamun, you will be awed by a huge golden statue of King Sejong placed in the square outside the palace gate. Turn around and you will see the statue of a soldier guarding the whole place.  The admission cost KRW3000. You could get to witness the Change of Guards ceremony at a certain time.  Take your time to explore the splendour and architecture."
3312,4.0,Rented a hanbok and was able to enter the palace for free. Joined the on-site tour in English and it was good :) Enjoyed the guard-changing ceremony too!
3313,5.0,I was there with friend after our work it's amazing and beautiful.we very much enjoy wearing costumes hanbox a traditional Korea Stye where u can find rent from outside palace cost approx 15000-20000 won its so nice to get this experience and you don't have to pay for entrance fee if you are in the costume. There is parade for guards exchanges which is very interesting too. We spend almost half day there it really a wonderful time☺️
3314,3.0,"It's a nice palace, but there is nothing that describes the buildings or the history of it.I was hoping that it would provide some detailed history of the buildings and not just where people take pictures ONLY."
3315,5.0,"I decided to immerse myself in at least one major attraction (ended up with three), and this was the crown jewel. Not only were the buildings beautiful and fascinating, but on the day I visited, there were parades and demonstrations by costumed employees. It is hard to fathom the life the Koreans have been under, given near-continuous wars and occupations, but this palace does give the visitor a feeling of the grandeur of the country at peace. I would recommend this, as well as the neighboring museums, for a deep appreciation of the people, their politeness and hospitality, despite many years of turmoil."
3316,5.0,"We took the English tour. Included in the admission. The tour was well done explaining the history and pointing out many items you wouldn't notice on your own. Mostly outside, so it is best to go on a nice day."
3317,4.0,We took the metro to Gyeongbokgung station and exited at exit 5. This will bring you to the left side entrance of the palace. The palace is huge so put on some good walking shoes to fully explore the entire compound. We arrived just in time for the changing of guards ceremony at 1100hrs which is a real highlight of our visit as we got to see the colorful and meaningful ceremony (commentary in English and mandarin is played on the PA System) explaining the ongoings. We then took some time to pose with the guards (warning no touching of their clothes or bodies when posing with them.) You will then need to buy tickets to access the inner section of the palace and pls note that washrooms are after the ticket booth somewhere in the middle section of the palace compound. We had to do a long detour back after we exited the compound. There are lot of locals and tourists in traditional hanbok dress who have purposely dressed up or rented outfits somewhere outside posing for photos throughout the palace. So incase you want to catch photos of someone in traditional dress. Also there is a hanbok dress up rental within the palace incase you want to join them. A must visit for a chance to see old Korean historical building and ceremonies.
3318,5.0,"Reconstructed palace of history. What a peaceful spot in the middle of a large and vibrant city. Kit yourself out in Hanbok costume for free entry or just pay and enjoy the delightful show. Koreans love this place. The costumes enliven and lighten the wide open spaces. The further you enter into the site, the nearer you get to the mountains. Delightful and a must see."
3319,4.0,"This palace is impressive and has been restored well. It is one of the busiest palaces so we went in the morning to avoid crowds. The buildings are beautiful but there is barely any information. I highly suggest either reading up about the structures online or hiring a guide to take you around the site. Without either of these things we were left stuck looking at buildings and wondering their purposes. Additionally, spend the small extra for a multi ticket as you can see other nearby palaces with it."
3320,3.0,"It's a smaller scale palace compared to other countries. But it's a good place to learn Korea history. Free guided tour offered in English inside the palace, check the official website for the schedules. The free tour's duration is about an hour."
3321,4.0,"This is one of several places you need to visit, learn about the different kingdoms, and how one king united the country preWWI, see the changing of the guards, and enjoy the beautiful view of the palace offers"
3322,4.0,"Sprawling Palace complex reconstructed based ancient documents, it is very interesting to see, but we would not have known what we were looking at, or the lifestyle and other interesting aspects of it if not for the guide we had. A good look at their ancient past."
3323,4.0,"If you only plan to see 1 Palace, this should be it because it is like the other main palaces, except huge, it takes a few hours to fully appreciate everything. Be sure to see an event with the guards, it's very interesting. Additionally you will see a lot of people wearing the traditional hanbok."
3324,5.0,Came to see the Palace with my sister. Soooooo pretty and the weather was perfect. We loved it. There's a museum as well as a lot of people doing reenactments. It is a fair amount of walking and some stairs.
3325,5.0,Expect a lot of outdoor walking as this palace consist of many separate buildings. So go on a sunny day if you want great photos or a cloudy day if you don't like constant exposure in the sun. You can watch the changing of the guards just outside of the palace as well but personally I didn't think it was that spectacular.  There are several free guided tours in various languages each day which I highly recommend as it gives you a little bit of background of the palace including some interesting facts. It lasts for an hour or so and afterwards you will still get plenty of time to explore the place yourself. There are plenty of nice photo spots especially if you're in Hanbok (the traditional Korean clothing).  Btw if you're dressed in Hanbok you get into the palace for free.  Including the guided tour we spent around 2.5 hours there.
3326,5.0,"In the morning you can view the changing of the guards, then you can walk around the site and imagine yourself back then."
3327,5.0,"This palace is one of many, but only one must to see. Plan to use half of day to move around and get inspired by great culture. Best time to visit is outside summer months since it's quite hot and crowded this period. Easy to get there by subway since it's located just downtown if city. After that can connect with leisure walking around the city."
3328,5.0,"If you must visit a pavilion or palace, consider making the trip to Gyeongbokgung. Even when we visited on a rainy day, it was still worth it. The palace is humongous in proportion, and is right in front of the National Museum of Korea. I was aware that parts of Gyeongbokgung are already reconstructions from the original, but the scale is still astounding. You'll be swept away with the sights and ambiance of Korea's past dynasties. There are so many photo taking opportunities too, especially if you look around the nearby city for Hanbok rentals. If you're more into the history of the palace, there are English audio guide rentals for solo travelers and walking tours in Chinese and English. I absolutely adore this landmark and I feel like I haven't seen enough of it to truly understand its complexity. This is a must-visit!"
3329,3.0,The grounds are mostly outdoors and the palace/throne rooms are even more open air. It takes a while to cover the area and I wish there was more educational value to the location. The changing of the guard ceremony was neat.
3330,3.0,Not far from the National Museum this Palace is set in very attractive gardens where the atmosphere is both clam and peaceful. Dating back over 600years it is still used today and we were told that it was the venue of a high level meeting involving major international dignitaries not too long ago. The pagoda style is typically Korean and although the building itself may only be of interest for a short period of time the grounds are well worth a visit.
3331,4.0,"We only got their around 3pm, and felt as though as we had to rush to see everything (and not get lost in the process!). Tea rooms were closing. There are walls within walls. We were heading to find the water feature, only to eventually find we'd been circumnavigating it: it was behind temporary walls for renovation!"
3332,5.0,We went here in traditional Hanbok (so you get in for free!). We brought ours but you can hire them in stores near to the Palace. Its a fun experience to walk round in Hanbok as you can imagine days past where the royalty would be walking round in those types of clothes. The museum areas are really informative and the palace is just beautiful. I would definitely recommend going if you are in Seoul.
3333,4.0,A giant palace which many get lost easily if you don't have a guide or a map. Buildings are similar across the whole palace with minor differences. It would be great if you have a guide with you as many things they mentioned was not easily discovered by tourists.
3334,5.0,I went with my sister when she came to visit me in Korea. I have been there many times before but it was the first time I attended the tour. This place is absolutely beautiful and the tour was very informative. Also went to the tea restaurant and had tea inside the palace which was an amazing experience. I felt very traditional!
3335,5.0,Went 2 hours before closing and had more than enough time to see everything we wanted to. If you want a guided tour go early but a I don't think it is needed
3336,5.0,"Even if you have only very limited time, this is a must see. Very impressive and built to last. Takes 1-2 hours."
3337,5.0,It's nice to visit here! you can try Korean traditional clothing nearby that you can get in the palace without admission fee. The palace is so big that you might need to spend whole morning here. Seeing their traditional building and have some pictures here are truly fun!
3338,5.0,"The palace was great place to go. It is quite extensive and we took one of the free tours in English, which was offered at the museum, and was very informative. Our tour guide was Korean but spoke e cel lent English. We visited on ""Culture Day"", which is the last Wednesday of every month when admission to museums are free so that was great. Highly recommend to visit if in Seoul!"
3339,5.0,I visited Changdeokgung palace and this one and I definitely recommend this one if you only have time for one. We enjoyed watching the changing of guards and it had more structures to see.
3340,5.0,First time coming to Korea with my husband. Always wish to try the Hanbok and finally i wore one. We were accompanied by our friend that stay in seoul. We went there by public bus and walk to the shop area to rent the hanbok with price KRW10.000 for 2 hours. If we wear hanbok then the entrance fee is free. We strolling around the palace and there were some music performance from the youngster which was really nice but we missed the changing guard ceremony as we arrived there at 15:00.
3341,4.0,"When visiting Seoul, it is necessary to tour palaces. I toured all of the palaces in Seoul. My conclusion, if you see one of the palaces, you have seen them all. That said, I still believe it is necessary to visit all the palaces as it is a one time experience. Gyeongbokgung's changing of the guard isn't too exciting, but still interesting."
3342,4.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is much more like a series of palaces within a palace. The majesty you feel when you walk in builds as you walk through its various inner palaces - as does the sense of wonder of how yet another suite of royal accommodations could be so impressively sited seemingly in total privacy despite being in a huge complex. And if you walk around the outer wall before entering you'll come across first a series of Mom&Pop hawker joints to eat in (recommended, they are full of personality and very honest, local food) and then some trendier renovated lanes full of boutiques and the like. Do make the effort to fully explore not just the palace, but everything there is around it."
3343,5.0,"If you go there in the morning,(around 10) you can see the changing of the guard. Then you can walk around until 11, and at 11 an english 1 hour tour starts and they can tell you all the history and stuff."
3344,5.0,"If you are a history buff, I recommend doing a guided tour. There is plenty of history to be explored. I recommend watching the change of guard."
3345,5.0,A glance into Korean history. Super huge and pretty palace. It was once damaged during japanese invasion period but it was rebuilt..
3346,5.0,"Enjoyed walking and enjoying the sights and architecture, especially with visitors in Hanbok around. After awhile the buildings all sort of look the same. Appreciated those temporary exhibitions within the grounds."
3347,4.0,This place is much better to walk around coz its way less crowded. its a big facility as well so be prepared for lots of walking. Take photos with the soldier in ancient uniform at the front gate and also a demonstration from the soldiers as well
3348,5.0,Definitely worth a visit when in Seoul. Very interesting and very well preserved for a small entrance fee. Try to see the changing of the guard ceremony - excellent to watch!
3349,5.0,It is one of main palaces located in heart of Seoul city. Connected well by Seoul metro. Has a museum attached to it. Behind the palace you can visit folk museum where traditional Korean folk dance are exhibited
3350,4.0,"one of the top-things-to-do in seoul on websites and travel guidebooks. it's good and fun. a lot of locals and tourist wearing hanbok, huge complex so it'll take some time. there's also a guard-changing ceremony that you can watch. and its cool.."
3351,5.0,It's a awesome and magistic place. You can walk around and explore this gigantic place by your self. Guide's are also good but according to me no need for that. Many things are in English and you don't need to know much if you only want to see the palace....how the kings and queens lived. It's a big place....i listened to music and walked around!. After I visited the palace museum that is free and nice to see. I also visited the teahouse inside the palace and drank one of the kings favourite tea against illness 😊 it was a nice experience! If you like culture....then you must visit this place...u won't regret it! 👍
3352,5.0,You just can't go to Seoul and not visit this place. Such a beautiful palace and entry is not expensive. Very big place so reserve at less half a day here.
3353,4.0,I enjoyed it. I went on a Sunday and many families and couples were there dressed in their traditional garments. It was fun!
3354,5.0,"Made me feel transported back to the time of the old Korean dynasty with a view of the palace, surroundings, the royal guards, and the heat! Nostalgic moment."
3355,4.0,We enjoyed the history of this Palace. The changing of guards is fun to watch. The people coming to visit have an opportunity to dress in costume dresses to visit the Palace. Completely awesome!!!!
3356,5.0,"We came here as part of a shore excursion on a cruise. The buildings and grounds are very interesting. I don't remember if there was much signage so you may need a guide to interpret what you are seeing. There were many young people roaming the grounds in traditional Korean dress and you can pose for pictures with them. I found that very cool and I enjoyed my time here. There were not a lot of inside things to see, just peering through a door."
3357,3.0,"Downtown. It's seem have to visit this place before you visiting another place tourism. No wifi, Clean, clear signage, family."
3358,4.0,"It is a must see attraction in Seoul that every visitors should pay a visit here. However if you are not immensly interested in history, peeping in through the front door is fine since every palace look exactly the same."
3359,5.0,Huge open and garden area to walk and must love the architectural work to be indpired. You can have pictures takenwith the guards at entrance. Beautiful area to wonder and see the museum and new President building but don't lose your entrance ticket to re-enter the palace ground. Also the temple building just above the museum. Worth the visit and canter around the palace ground plus the emper throne. Enjoy the magnificent architecture.
3360,5.0,Outstanding museum attached to the palace. The grounds and palace were very interesting. Took lots of photos.
3361,3.0,"As Korea and Chinese has similar cultures, if you had been to Forbidden City in Beijing,then this is a dwarf version. However, if this is your first time in Korea, it would be recommended. One can tell that they put in a lot of effort to make the place interesting by adding a lot of cultural experience for tourist. Overall it's fun and entertaining and worth the visit!"
3362,5.0,It was great place to see the history of Korea- Josun Dynasty including good time and sad time. (the last King of Josen Dynasty)
3363,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung is the main among ""Five Grand Palaces"" in Seoul – Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung and Gyeonghuigung. But! Its rival -Changdeokgung became UNESCO World Heritage from 1997. Why didn`t Gyeongbokgung become despite its historical meaning? Thanks to its history! It was twice destroyed by the Japanese during the invasion and occupation. Last time Japanese destroyed it as the symbol of national independence and sovereign power. That`s why most buildings inside are rather new. Not restored but built again. Palace is closed eaurly at 5.00. p.m. That`s why I could visit it just with 3rd attemt. We`ve lost 1-st day in Seoul due to Jetlag, 2-nd and 3rg days I arrived from Namhanseong and Suwon just at closure. I arrived just in time for the closing. And only in the morning before leaving for Busan, I was able to come almost to the opening. It was a weekend and the Babylonian pandemonium was in the Palace. But mostly Koreans participated in Babylonian pandemonium. According to the traditional attitudes of the tourist to look at the Palace of nothing. No furniture. Sculptures no. Paintings either. In short, not Versailles, and not the Hermitage. If this is your first Palace, a slight disappointment or confusion can not be. I already had one Palace of the big five and 2 UNESCO world heritage in Suwon and Namhansanseong, so I was not surprised. Once ambivalent sense it is necessary to visit: Gangnyeongjeon (King's Quarters), Geunjeongjeon (Throne Hall), Gyeonghoeru (Royal Banquet Hall), Gyotaejeon (Queen's Quarters). They are almost the same. But next place will be romantic - Hyangwonjeong Pavilion near small lake. After that I would recommend to turn to right (East) and visit Korean folk museum. You`ll able to understand that the technological victories of Samsung, LG and Hundai on the world markets are not random, but prepared by the whole history of Korea. Entrance ticket is the same as in Gyeongbokgung."
3364,5.0,This was the second time I was here because of night entry. From 19:00 - 21:30 you could wander around the palace for night scenes. There were not a lot to see but the most important thing was to see the building above the lake. The mot stunning view I saw in Seoul. Definitely can't miss the chance for night entry!
3365,5.0,Very scenic view for couples to stroll around. The spring Breeze and setting sun makes it so relaxing to walk! Should drop by the national folk museum of Korea as well since it just beside.
3366,5.0,"This palace is highly accessible to those who visit Seoul. The palace has many features that both shared with other traditional Asian architecture, and also unique for Korea. Like many other grand structures built by hand in other parts of the world, this palace made me feel in awe over the engineering and human effort required to erect such a building. Worth a relatively quick 1 to 2-hour visit for first-timers to Korea."
3367,5.0,"Historic Palace in central Seoul on all the standard tours so you won't miss out seeing it, very enjoyable"
3368,5.0,One of the things that I look forward to when I visit the country is the overall cultural experience. A lot of countries today are so westernized and modernized that they lose the culture and what is their country is known for.  But for Seoul it is intact. The palaces and its history are preserved. Must see when in South Korea!
3369,4.0,"It is a beautiful place and good to learn about their cultures. You will be in best experience if you rent a hanbok from nearby store and visit around the palace, I felt like I was in Korean drama, had a lot of Instagram shots ;)"
3370,4.0,A must if you visit Seoul! The views and the palace is heavenly. Try to go on weekday as so many people are there on weekend and hard to see the performances!
3371,4.0,We visited the Palace in the morning where there were no crowds yet. There were several buildings to walk by. We were awed by the guards ceremony. Amazing! So surreal!
3372,5.0,If you plan to do just one palace in Seoul do this one. It's quite nice and grand. I'm general palaces in Korea and China are not as lavish as in India but it's worth a visit. Best if you go wearing a local Korean dress which you can rent just outside the palace
3373,5.0,Plenty to see here . Maybe the first thing people look at in Seoul . It gives some history and there are many shrines or temples around . Where the royal family used to live and in 1895 where the Queen was brutally murdered by the Japanese . Maybe 30 houses around and a change of guard on display at entrance . Price is cheap to gain entrance . And worth it Also you can drink tea inside one of the buildings - looks like a tea ceremony Many dressed up in traditional dress here .
3374,5.0,"This Palace was located in a park which I would recommend going to see. The day we went was snowing and cold, but I think that only added to the atmosphere. While there were people there, the park was rather serene save for some passing tour groups. You couldn't go in the palace, understandably, but its good for a picture."
3375,4.0,"The palace was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty. Built in 1395, located in northern Seoul, South Korea. The place was very beautiful and it was mesmerizing soaking on the beauty of it. Take a slow walk and take lots of photos."
3376,5.0,Enjoyed the visit here since it showcases the history and beautiful culture of Korea! Must visit especially first timers!
3377,5.0,"Have been to gyeongbokgung few times. This is a really nice place to visit. My family loves it a lot as you can try on hanbuk for free and takes pictures in front of the gyeongbokgung. Not sure if they still have this service now. Anyways, its a great place that highly recommended."
3378,4.0,"A palace in a city. I was stayed near City Hall subway. I was walking about 10 minutes to the Palace. If you are wearing Hanbok located outside the Palace (nearby shop houses, the rental price usually KRW 10,000 for 2 hours), then the entrance fee to the Palace would be waived, or else per pax for adult would be KRW 3,000 as listed on Korea Tourism website. However, I bought 3 adult ticket at KRW 4,500 on Sunday, which I don't know the reason why cheaper. There were some flea market stalls located all along the way to GwangHuaMen (I guess only available on Sunday)."
3379,4.0,"The palace is a beautiful oasis in the middle of a large, modern city, sparking your imagination eith ideas of what life must have been like 600 years ago in Korea, when kings ruled the country."
3380,5.0,"Great and well maintained palace and grounds. Very clean and pleasant with so many Koreans dressed in their traditional clothes. Recommend accepting the school-children guides, they do it for school credits, are well informed and give you a really interesting tour of the palace. The guides do it voluntarily and do not accept any money, not even when you offer to at least buy them a drink. Interesting history. Recommend when visiting Seoul."
3381,5.0,To explore the whole surrounding you need at least 2-3 hours. Very wide and cool fresh ambiance around the palace. So many tourists when we went there. You can rent Hanbok dress outside but my daughter did not like to wear it coz it's thick & itchy. We walked about 10 to 15 minutes to reach the Blue house which is at the back of the palace. But very nice to explore
3382,5.0,Bf was excited looking at the guard swapping. It's a cultural program with volunteers dressing up in ancient outfits. What amazed me was how many men and women walked around through the garden taking selfies in beautiful traditional Korean clothes. Apparently you can rent them somewhere. A lot of couples in love taking romantic pictures. There's a cafe and another museum within.
3383,4.0,"Very popular palace grounds for tourists and history or drama-loving locals wishing to experience romantic or glamorous moments as a palace maid, concubine or princess. Costume rentals are available nearby for about 20000 won for 4 hours. An open traditional musical song-dance troupe performs nearby followed by free photo sessions."
3384,5.0,This was my second time at Gyeongbokgung Palace. The 1st time was on a tour so we didn't get to see some parts of it. It's a beautiful place to visit which has lots of history & great place to take photos as well.
3385,5.0,"the must do in seoul, entrance cost 3000won (3$) really typical and nice, one tip : nowadays there are korean teenagers students (wearing yellow clothe) they can guide you around the palace for free. they just want to communicate in english, they speak english perfectly for teenagers, so do it, if someone ask you to get a student guide, just say yes!"
3386,5.0,Together with a guide a visit to this palace will give you a good idea of the history of South Korea. See the changing of the guard and learn about former dynasties.
3387,4.0,"Big area with not a lot of exhibit to hold your attention. We were there during their Royal Culture Festival, so there was more activities going on and lots of people dressed up, which helped add to the atmosphere.  Can be pretty hot in May, not a lot of shelter in the grounds. Ticketing counters are also in the open. Paths are bumpy and rocky, making it difficult to push a stroller around.  It's recommended to visit the National Palace Museum first to get a better understanding of the history of the place as there isn't many signages within."
3388,4.0,"The kitchen area had been renovated for several years and it had been open. And the cocubines' residence are under the renovated right now. The place where Queen was assassinated is open now for the limited period. It was not open at all for long time, and we had chance to see it 2 days ago. There were many visitors wearing Korean traditional costumes, Hanbok, because it is free admission for them, who wear the costume. They said there are many rental shops nearby. That made the place garden more beautiful."
3389,4.0,"Unlike most Asian Palaces you visit on city tours, this one had a lot of depth and diversification to it. The palace itself is beautiful but it leads into so many more things, such as the gardens and and water features. I normally find this stuff a bit of a bore; but this time round I was engaged and interested by the surroundings.... your walking through the past, with a thriving 21st century city surrounding you; it's very unique!"
3390,4.0,"Of all the palaces in Seoul, I think this is a must to visit. The palace ground is huge and the scenery is amazing. Going to palaces can give you a glimpse of Korea's colorful history."
3391,5.0,Beautiful palace and changing of the guard. English speaking tour guide gave good info. Also several museums.
3392,3.0,Big and sprawling . Very spread out and lots of dust and open spaces. The changing of the guards was interestin
3393,3.0,"My wife and I visited Gyeongbokgung Palace earlier this year. At first sight, the palace is impressive. However, once you see the building...there really isn't a lot to do. The grounds could use some greenery and some flowers. There's lots of open spaces...maybe add a fountain or two?  Allow 30-45 minutes tops."
3394,5.0,"A must visit! Great palace, very big area and many buildings, garden and museum inside. Very beautiful trees. You can feel real Seoul here!"
3395,5.0,Very interesting and amazing what mankind can do . Make sure u guys get tour guide to explain to you the building and what it was made for and who accuplied it.
3396,5.0,"We visited here with a guide on our one full day in Seoul. Happily our visit was timed so we got to see the changing of the guard ceremony which really added to our experience. Lucky to have our guide who explained the symbolism of the construction and feng shui. There were tons of Korean school kids there on field trips - apparently it's a thing for them to dress up in traditional costumes - very fun to see them. Many were also doing a scavenger hunt and ""take a pic with a foreigner"" was on the list so we are in several pics 😂 Very fun, enjoyed our visit."
3397,5.0,We went to the palace with a guide (Ben Moon from Viator) who was not only quite knowledgeable about the palace but about Korean history and the city of Seoul. The Palace itself is quite impressive. An absolute must if you are in Seoul.
3398,5.0,Beautiful palace and worth a visit whilst in Seoul. Easy to get to and lovely to spend approximately 3-4 hours just walking around. Definitely worth a visit!
3399,5.0,"The palace is an expansive display of royal living in Korea. Beautifully painted rooms, buildings and courtyards. The changing of the guard, with a band, is colorful and well executed - at 10:00 AM - get there a little early to get a good spot on the ropes. Don't miss the queen's gardens in the back."
3400,5.0,"It was like walking in to a time warp that transports you back in olden times. A lot of guests were dressed in traditional Korean attire. We even got to see the changing of guards ceremony which my kids particularly found amazing. So much to see, so many nice spots to take photos of."
3401,4.0,I think a tour guide is necessary for something like this so they can help explain the history to you. There are not placards that do that here. Also make sure to be there for the changing of the guard.
3402,4.0,"Beautiful. many young women/men dressed in hanbok taking pictures. consider looking into reservation for inner place prior to visiting for access. Also, during certain time of the year, they apparently open for night visit with performances."
3403,4.0,I just visited the outside of the palace as everything inside was either closed or needs a tour reservation one day in advance. The outside is beautiful enough to enjoy although most of the 'common' quarters do look a like. There is a free museum next door about palace life as well as some other museums nearby. The day I was there though it was very crowded with kids on school trips but if they get the same assignment as while I was there lots of those kids will ask to take a picture with you (assignment was take picture with a foreigner) which depending on your personality could be annoying or cute.
3404,4.0,"This palace is beautiful and serene, the centre is main building, very huge surrounded with a small palace, love the pond in the back. There is separate museum at the end, also one old traditional house which is interesting to walk inside to see how people live in the olden days. Tour guide is available at certain times, the changing guard ceremony is one of a good event not to miss. It is worth to spend half day to visit this palace."
3405,4.0,Dont miss it as it is an important place in the history of South Korea. At the center of the city. Interesting.
3406,5.0,"This time, I visited the palace in the Spring, and as in Fall, the palace and grounds are just gorgeous. Interesting to see the change of guards."
3407,5.0,"Beautiful palace in Seoul. My very first time visiting a palace in Seoul and I was immediately captivated by its timeless beauty. Highly recommend to visit for first timers to Seoul, South Korea. Easily accessible via public transport."
3408,5.0,"The very first time for us to be here in South Korea 🇰🇷 and it such a great experience for us and we are having fun and wonderful city tour. Our tour guide was Mia, such an ideal tour guide who was very energetic, friendjy and knowledgeable. Almost all she recommended about food to eat and to have/buy when we are in Korea were followed. Hope and pray, i could come back in different season and i want to go to Jeju Island on my next visit😇!"
3409,3.0,"Nothing really special. Some other palaces are even more attrative imho. Main place of attraction for thousands of tourists but I would not say this palace is the best one in Seoul. OF course it is the biggest one, time is running fast, you can easily spend 4-5 hours here and at the same time you'll have a feeling that it was 40-50 minutes... strange, really!"
3410,3.0,"there were many people, but not much explanation about the buildings on the site. it might be nice for a picnic for family, but too much walking to see buildings which are not given any explanation in any language."
3411,5.0,best place to know about korean culture and their history. their past and how time have changed everything
3412,3.0,"A very interesting and intriguing place to visit, however, strollers are not recommended. Queue for admission tickets was quick and easy."
3413,5.0,"Its a must visit on the first trip to korea , renting hanboks while taking picture with the palace and the great atmosphere along with friends."
3414,5.0,"Very interesting place to visit in Korea. If you are like me who enjoys looking at ancient architecture, then visiting this place is a must. It really capture the feeling of being in that century."
3415,4.0,Visited this place many of times and keep coming back with friends. It's great to see the historical attire that the staff wears and also the changing of the guard show. Everyone loves to take pictures with the guards and you will see a lot of people wearing tradition Korean attire that they rent from the local shops around the palace. A must visit in Seoul
3416,4.0,"The palace contained beautiful architect and history. We can rent some traditional hanbok at fair price to take photo here. If you want to explore everything here, you should spend about 2 hours or more."
3417,3.0,"We went to see the palace and a special ""rehearsal"" for a huge ceremony. Very interesting! Lots of people, lots of music, lots of heat. The rehearsal went on for over 2 hours starting around 11 am on Sunday. They worked on tiny parts of the ceremony over and over, yet missed glaring errors. However, it was very interesting to watch this changing ceremony, hear the very unique music. Costumes were incredibly elaborate. Don't know if this is a normal rehearsal done frequently, or only occasionally. It was not the normal changing of the guard After the heat became too intense, we went into the Museum It was free but there is not much there. They don't seem to have much historical memorabilia but they do have 2 very cool vintage autos in the atrium which seem like the center for all attractions. Only spent about 1 hr in the museum and that was more than enough time to cool off and sit for awhile."
3418,4.0,"We managed to catch the Guard Changing ceremony and it's very interesting. If you watch K-dramas, you get an idea how the Joseon era was. The palace is huge with many people wearing the hanbuk."
3419,5.0,"The original palace of the Joseon dynasty, that has been destroyed & rebuilt several times. Very impressive. Try to arrive on the hour to see the changing of the guards, an impressive display with several lines of guards with flags & drums. We were there on a Saturday and there were lots of Koreans dressed up in rented old traditional costumes (taking lots of selfies). Great historical site."
3420,5.0,You feel youself go back to the Ancient Orient when visiting it the way it is built reminds you of thr great kingdoms that were once in this part of the world.
3421,5.0,"We came way too late and the ceremony just finished. So sad. The place is worth your half day time. It's beautiful and you will get to know Korea'a history better. Hanbok rental available on the area. Lots of people, both foreigner and korean, wear hanbok and stroll around the palace"
3422,4.0,"Even if we visited the place in a rainy day we enjoyed its magnificence and beauty. There are many areas to visit: the library, meeting rooms, garden, small lak, etc. all beautiful and kept in excellent form. It gives the right idea of how was living in a place like this during the historical period. Well worth visit."
3423,5.0,"By far one of my favorite palace in Seoul, with mountains on the background, beautiful at whatever season, it is the symbol I have kept from Seoul."
3424,5.0,"It is large palace with different buildings and big park. You can spend hours here and you won't be bored, you will be relaxed. After 10.00 starts big noise with incoming groups. I don't know whether It was because of election or it was usual."
3425,3.0,"Was there to visit the palace in Apr 2017. Location is central u can take a subway to the station named after it and a short walk will take u to main gate. It happened to be I think royal culture week so many Koreans dressed in traditional hangbok so it was quite a sight. Entrance fee is not expensive only around 1500 won I think. I rented a audio guide in English but on hindsight I would suggest to take the free English guided tour at specific intervals daily. As the audio guide was cumbersome to use and info was a bit of overkill. But it gives some background on the palace which was central piece of Korean culture. The place was definitely much smaller than Beijing forbidden city which I feel is a much better tourist experience. Probably because most of buildings were burnt down during jap occupation and the rebuilt ones had spartan deco within. And there wasn't much exhibition on ancient palace exhibits unlike the forbidden city. Hence my average rating. But if u haven't been to china, I guess it's still a good way to spend 2-3 hours of your time understanding the Korean history and the royal family."
3426,4.0,"We had a lovely day wandering around Gyeongbokgung palace - the grounds are fairly expansive so wear comfy shoes, but many of the buildings aren't reconstructed yet so it is definitely ideal to visit when the weather is reliably nice. Super cheap to enter (₩3000) and a nice way to kill an afternoon."
3427,5.0,"Amazed with the culture where traditions and the historical areas have been preserved. This Palace is really wide and you need a long time to explore. If you really interested in seeing the whole area, better come early."
3428,5.0,Nice place to walk around for a few hours. Very pretty and we were lucky to see the flower blossom during the season. Can get crowded from time to time but overall is a must see in seoul
3429,5.0,"We went here the first day were were in Seoul, normally closed on Tuesdays but open for Buddha's birthday. Make sure you take the free English speaking tour. Very informative and educational. Loved seeing the teenage girls in their traditional Korean dress (Hanbok). I heard they get in free if they wear it. Adds to the experience, fun to see them doing selfies. So cute. The gardens were amazing, don't miss the water view in the back. Peonies were in bloom. If you go out the back gate you can see the ""Blue Housea', the president's residence. Very highly guarded."
3430,5.0,One of five great Palaces to visit. Close to metro station. Free entry for over 60. The architecture is stunning. Guide leaflets in English most udeful
3431,4.0,I visited the palace as part of a weekend in Seoul and it was a great way to spend some time. The grounds are beautiful and the palace buildings are steeped in history. I would recommend getting a guided tour as we did not and so the deeper history of the palace remained unknown.
3432,5.0,"Without doubt Gyeonbokgung Palace visit is a must in Seoul. Gardens and the buildings are amazing !! I love to see people dressed with the traditional dress. If you go in the right moment, you also can see the cherry trees blossom !"
3433,4.0,Went there specifically to catch changing of the guards which take place at 10am and 2pm. There are also other guard changing performances at different times so check the Visit Korea website for more info. Nice place to stroll around for an hour or so.
3434,4.0,"This palace is the biggest palace of Seoul built by Joseon dynasty. It further includes many sub palaces, kitchens, utility areas, stables etc. that makes it a perfect palace. It was built about 600 years ago but destroyed in a fire, the present palace was restored a century ago. A well maintained palace. The changing of guards ceremony is delightful. A must if you have interest in history & monuments. Happy travelling!!"
3435,4.0,"For 3,ooo Won this palace is a bargain. We spent a few hours walking around the grounds and the beautiful colors and paints were mesmerizing. Interesting place to visit,"
3436,5.0,"Depending on how informative is your guide is, this is a must do historic site visit. We were here on a rainy day so it was cold and wet walking through the palace grounds, but our guide was very informative which made the visit interesting. We took a private tour as we had 3 kids in tow- but we did not reach there in time for the changing of the palace guards. Many tourist and locals were in periodic costumes which added to the lovely ambiance in spite of the wet day."
3437,4.0,"When I visited there was a rehearsal going on for a concert. It very enjoyable. I enjoyed the sense of calm, beauty and history of the palace."
3438,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung is the main palace of jeoseon dynasty. This ground had witness the birth of hangeul, modern society, until japanese occupation. The palace ground is really beautiful. Placed in the heart of Seoul.  I watched 2 days 1 night korean variety show. They had episode where they explore the palace. From that show, i become even more fascinated by the palace"
3439,4.0,This place is huge. You'll find many locals and tourists wearing hanbok here. It does get very crowded so it's best to to get here early.
3440,4.0,"Interesting palace, a lot of people are dress like the old Korean days, and walking around. Not too good on a rainy day."
3441,3.0,Your typical palace in the middle of the city. Crowded with other tourists. Good for what it is and helpful to have a guide.
3442,4.0,"This Palace is located in a super central area of Seoul. I went for the changing of the guard and spent about an hour walking around. Its not as impressive as say the forbidden city in Beijing but its beautiful and i love how locals and some visitors dress up in the old style outfits and walk around the palace. Its something quite interesting to see. Its walking distance then to Insa-dong and also the area street. Def must visit and if time is short, you really can get around this in under an hour."
3443,3.0,"This is one of the big attractions in Seoul, but I felt there is so much to do in the city and this just isn't a top memory. The palace and the grounds are basically a reconstruction because of various wars. I know it's not their fault, but it makes it less interesting to me. It is pretty, but many of the buildings just feel like the same thing over and over. You're probably going to see it, but with such a wonderful city, I would recommend seeing more of modern Seoul."
3444,5.0,We were welcomed by a teen guide working on her English skills. She was amazing and knew lots of details about the history of the palace. She explained that she did the tours once a month for school credit. The changing of the guard is a colourful must see. The only disappointment was that all you get to see are empty buildings. There are a few sticks of furniture - such as a replica throne and bed frame but not much else.
3445,4.0,"An ensemble of palaces and annexed buildings with a very beautiful garden We had some bigger expectations than changing the guard, but the process is rather tricky maybe because of the translation of the ceremony in 3 languages"
3446,5.0,"Beautiful palace which you cant skip if you come to seoul. Try to come early so you can see the changing guard which always start at 10am. The enterance fee costs 3000 won per person, which is reasonable to see all sides of the palace. Book the guide tour for the middle palace in advance so you can go up and see the inside bit. This will cost you nothing."
3447,4.0,"We booked ahead for the secret garden tour. One quick point-the website for this booking is great, even allowed us to change our times easily. Enjoyed the tour of the gardens, very pretty and less crowded. The Palace grounds were nice too, with the exterior of the buildings beautifully decorated. Enjoyed seeing visitors in their traditional Korean dress too, gives the visit a fun twist."
3448,5.0,Charming huge palace. Great to visit in the weekend because there's plenty of tourists who like to dress up and have their picture taken while wearing traditional Hanbok.  The first area of the Palace doesn't do it justice. Go explore to the other wings and you'll discover beauty everywhere.
3449,5.0,I love history so I always try to visit local historical sites to get a deeper understanding of a local history. Though the style was borrowed from ancient China it still has its own unique Korean features.
3450,5.0,I find the history very interesting especially after visiting the Korea History Museum. The palace is amazing. Sat for a while to soak in the history I learned.
3451,5.0,Enjoyed this place very much. Their is a lot of tourists so be prepared. If you wear traditional Korean clothes than you can waive the 5 US dollar fee that is required to go inside.
3452,4.0,When in Seoul all visitors seem to go to this old Palace as the center piece of Sth Korean history which indeed it was. Holds great attraction for visitors from Japan who seem to arrive here by the bus load. A great stroll though history
3453,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung palace was our first highlights of our Korean adventure. We higher a local guide that introduced to us to all palace secrets and stories and regardless that most of it that we so was a reproduction from originally made palace due to all destruction that happened, we had a more than clear and authentic experience in understanding the greatness of architecture, art and inventions that can put our European medieval knowledge and accomplishment at shame. Monument more than worth to be put on MUST SEE list!"
3454,4.0,"I was lucky enough to visit here on the last Wednesday of the month when entry to public attractions such as this are free. The palace is beautiful and a great way to spend a couple of hours. The place is huge, much larger than I expected so make sure you have plenty of time to explore."
3455,3.0,"It was neat but it was busy, too busy. Would have been a better experience to go outside of the changing of the guards to experience the palace. Don't get me wrong the palace is quite beautiful but the crowds were particular busy at this time. The crowds did provide a great opportunity for people watching, a favourite travel activity."
3456,4.0,Made it in time for the parade.The guards wore very colorful attire The palace was really huge so lots of walking to do if you want to see the grounds. Its very crowded as its a tourist attraction
3457,5.0,Make sure to catch the changing of the guard. It is a nice display of old Korean culture. Put notice to the many Korean visitors in traditional costumes. It gives the place a nice atmosphere. The tea house is rich decorated and serves Korean tea and sweets.
3458,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palae is de biggest of the five grand palaces built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty. The magnificant Gwanghwamun entrance gate is situated right in the hear of Seoul and one of its most famous landmarks. if you don't have much time for your visit to Seoul, this place can't be missed. The palace buildings are mostly reconstructions, because lots of the buildings were destroyed during the Japanese occupation. The Koreans took great care in reconstructing the building as faithfully as possible.  The site is very big, so you'll at least need two hours to see everything. When in a hurry make sure not to miss Gyeonghoeru, a beautiful construction sitting on top of 48 stone pillars. reflected in the surrounding artificial lake. Likewise he trone hall (Geunjeongjeon) is a National Treasure which will leave a lasting impression.  Don't miss the traditional changing of the guards ceremony!"
3459,4.0,"Good place,good culture,but not much direction about a place in english writing.so much turn around to find what i want to.very big place need much time to around it"
3460,5.0,"We spent a very enjoyable few hours at this palace. It covers a surprisingly large area, so you do need time to explore it all. The setting, with mountains behind, is wonderful and having so many locals dressed in Hanbok adds to the enjoyment. The combination ticket, which gives entry to 4 palaces and Jongmyo Shrine for W10,000 (less than £7) make it excellent value for money. Not to be missed."
3461,5.0,The Korean Tourism Organisation post an announcement that the Palace has a special night opening. I went there and find a traditional concert in open air. superb.  THe night view - superb  Do join the Korean Tourism Organization facebook for notification of special events.
3462,4.0,Visited this place... Beautiful and good for taking pictures.... There are many place in the city... Mostly similar... Its better to choose 2 palace only... Any two... Because almost all palaces are same...
3463,4.0,"It's kind of dry at first, now knowing what to expect inside. What you first see upon reaching Gyeongnokgung grounds is the largest structure. Once you're inside, you will be greeted with more old Korean palace, temples and houses and greenery. While inside the palace grounds, you can see this mountain that accentuates the whole scenery. Each area gives a new perspective, all equally magnificent. Don't miss this while in Seoul."
3464,5.0,"It's is always great and inspiring to visit historic locations like the palaces in South Korea, and this is one of the ones that have to visit.  We were lucky to take pictures with local students who dressed up in traditional clothes who were visiting the palace on that day."
3465,5.0,"After living in Japan for 5 years, I feel that sometimes I get a bit oversaturated with all the beautiful things I've seen here, but this palace still managed to impress me with its size and beautiful gardens. It was so enjoyable walking around, very serene and amazing. Definitely a must-visit if you're in Seoul! If you can make it when the changing of guards occurs, you should definitely try as the ceremony of it is really cool to experience."
3466,5.0,"A nice palace, a bit crowded during our visit, but worth a visit and take a visit wearing hanbok, a traditional korean dress."
3467,4.0,"We enjoyed going through out the grounds of this Grand Palace. My favorite place was the Banquet Building. It was three levels high on the edge of a lovely lake surrounded by willow trees. Outside the palace there are businesses where you can rent a beautiful traditional Hanbok outfit to wear for the day. We didn't rent any of them, but really enjoyed seeing all the beautiful Hanboks worn by others, it really added to the experience. We also visited the National Folk Museum, which is also on the same grounds of the palace. I recommend going to it. As we were leaving we were able to see the changing of the guards. Highly recommended that you go here when visiting Seoul. One of our family members has problems walking great distances, so they rented a wheelchair. These chairs are very narrow in the seat. She isn't over weight but she had problems sitting in it."
3468,4.0,Went during the Lunar New Year. Admission was free and you get to go the Natural Folk Museum while you are there. There were cultural performances and activities all around the place you can do. I even managed to try on their traditional hanbok for free!
3469,4.0,"Really gave a feeling for the scale of a palace and the significance of the royal family. Very much and ""outside"" tour with little insight into the life in the buildings"
3470,3.0,"Visited with two young kids - you can tell an attempt was made to make the place wheel chair accessible but we had a really hard time getting the stroller across the grounds. .  There's not much to see inside as most of its not original but reconstruction. If you been to the Imperial palace in other Asian cities (Beijing, Tokyo, Taipei) you will not find this site particularly impressive.  On the plus side - admission is cheap and tourist sights are few in the city. Makes a relaxing stroll on a sunny day.  Be mindful it closes on Tuesday"
3471,4.0,A great place to wander around and wonder and take photos. If possible make sure to take in the changing of the guard as it is quite special. A very worthwhile afternoon or morning!
3472,5.0,It is a very beautiful place which definity needs a visit. It gives you a taste of the local culture and is definitely highly recommended
3473,5.0,"We were fortunate to get there in time to see the changing of the guard which of itself would have been worth the visit. It has suffered from several fires and eventually was burned down during the Japanese occupation. Fortunately, it has been reconstructed several times and now brought back to its former glory."
3474,5.0,"No doubt the palace is a must see while in Seoul. Easy accessible by subway but if possible go on a weekday. I went on a Saturday and it was crowded with people. It seems that on Saturdays children from schools are brought here as a field trip so you have 5-7 years old running all over. On the other hand, the architecture was so beautiful is amazing to see that even though most of the palace was badly deteriorated as a result of the Japanese invasion the efforts for reconstruction allows tourist to submerge in this wonder."
3475,4.0,"The architecture of the buildings are nice and too many Koreans wearing hanbok the Korean costume, so it gives you feeling of tradition and culture of Korea while you are there. The palace has many buildings and there are national folk museum and national palace museum also so you visit them all together and you will have very good Korean cultural experience. Don't miss the changing of the guards during your visit we watched them at 2:00 pm but i think they have another changing show at 11:00 am. You can join your visit with Insandong area which it is very near about 10-15 minutes walking and one stop by metro."
3476,5.0,We absorbed so much of Korean history when we went there. From watching changing of guard to viewing the palace.... I would recommend it to anyone.
3477,5.0,"We arrived at 1pm when there was a guard duty ceremony, and then went on the free one hour English guided tour. People wearing traditional dress were everywhere. Beautiful guardens and interesting buildings and statues. With several museums inside too."
3478,4.0,"My wife and I went to Seoul so I could visit sites and locations from serving there many years ago in the military. We like the luxury of Four Seasons hotels but like the location of the Seoul Four Seasons as it was central to the locations I wanted to visit. My contacts with the staff started long before we arrived. I email the Concierge in relation to the locations I wanted to visit and how to best coordinate my travels. In a few emails we had complete a plan which included all sites within our limited time. The Concierge team is excellent. They continued to guide us after we arrived. When we checked in we soon learn this excellence extended though the entire staff from the escort to our room, dining staff, everyone. We felt very much at home and comfortable. We had a premiere room with a great view of modern Seoul. The room was very spacious, clean, modern and well equipped for any traveler. The first evening we ate a late dinner at the hotel. Great service and great food, a sampling of Korean dished. Each morning we ate at the breakfast buffet. We managed to eat light but walking and viewing all the culinary offerings is a tour in its self. An excellent exhibit of historic Korean royal architecture. Visit in the mornings around 10:00 am entering at the South Gate to catch the changing of the royal guards. Note the building techniques, colors and layout to the palace buildings. At extensive as these palace grounds are the represent only about 14% of the original structures. Make it a point to exit through the North Gate. The building straight head is the Presidential Blue house (named for its blue title roof). Korea’s equivalent to the White House."
3479,4.0,"This is one of the old palace in Seoul.You will definitely love this place if you are a fan of Korean drama, you can find many familiar corners where movies were filmed. Wearing Hanbok , walking around the palace is a great experience for Korean fan too. You can hire custom some place such as Hanok Village , they allow you to hire it from 1 hour to 1 day."
3480,5.0,"I was there in late April , all threes were blooming inside and made this palace like a heaven , interesting views and nice architectures, many ladies and gents worn Korean customs and were roaming there I could imagine that I was in 500 years back , was such a great experience , don't miss it :)"
3481,5.0,Make sure you get to see the changing of the guard which happens at regular intervals throughout the day
3482,4.0,Well kept palace with plenty of photo taking opportunities. Korean girls get in free if they dress in traditional South Korean dresses which adds nicely to the authenticity and they're more than happy for you to have your photos taken with them as long as they can have photos with you too.
3483,4.0,This place is same location with national folks museum. I came here by walk from insadong and bukchon. Better you take pic here when using hanbok ;))
3484,5.0,We came here on a private tour from the Incheon Cruise Port. Very nice place to walk around. I would come here again and spend some more time.
3485,5.0,"Its was nice and big palace. There are tour guide in english, japan & korea. Please rent hanbok and take picture in this area! there are walking distance between palace & national folk village. Bukchon hanok village also walking distance!"
3486,3.0,I've been to other palaces in Asia that has more information . This was just little halls after halls with no information and any cultural history. The architecture of the buildings are nice . So took some pictures but not worth the visit if you're looking for detailed tours. I expected to see some lovely gardens and rooms with beautiful furniture and information on how and what they used each hall for . So I was very dissapointed.
3487,4.0,"Had part of a morning spare in Seoul so went for a short walk and tumbled upon this palace, dating back to 1395. It sits juxtaposed against mirrored glass modern buildings but the serenity within its walls holds the modern world at bay. The outer walls are long and impressive but they nevertheless still hide the scale of what lies behind. One can but only imagine life within the cloistered palace walls and its inner and outer courts, gardens and lake.  After reading about the destruction of the palace by fire during the Japanese invasion in 1592 and the taking apart by the Japanese of the reconstructed buildings during their occupation between 1910 - 1945, one must admire the Korean spirit and skill in ensuring such a faithful restoration of the Heungnyemun Gate, the Gwanghwamun Gate and the various royal and princely quarters. Walking through the palace grounds while there were so many locals wearing traditional costume/clothing during their own visits made it easier to imagine the daily bustle of a bygone era.  An interesting place to visit."
3488,5.0,"It was absolutely stunning and bigger than I thought it would be. We had conveniently come on a cultural day (which is the last wednesday of every month) so entrance was free!! We also got a free English tour which I would highly recommend. She was super nice and friendly!! You can just find a tour there so look up the times when your language will be available. I learned way more history than I would've by just looking. Overall, a very beautiful place with lots of history"
3489,5.0,Gyeongbokgung Palace is arguably regarded as being the most beautiful and grandest of all five palaces. It also houses the National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum within the premises of the complex.
3490,3.0,"We didn't get into the palace but only the square with two big gates. There were many tourists (probably) wearing hanbok, which make me think of the scenes in Korean dramas. A historic site but I only spent around 15 minutes taking pictures there."
3491,5.0,Was really impressed by the palace and spent most of a full day there wandering around all of the different buildings.
3492,5.0,Wonderful complex enhanced by very knowledgeable guide who described the site and history entertainingly and clearly making the visit very enjoyable. The Palace is a 'Must See' for any visitor to Seoul.
3493,5.0,"We went by taxi from our hotel down past The Square on a Sunday - where 1000,s of people were setting up another protest for the day & arrived @ Gyeongbokgung Palace Gate to be greeted by 100,s of people all dressed up in various costumes taking pictures of each other. Gyeongbokgung Palace ls huge & overlooks The Square & the city buildings in the background. We took photos of & had photos taken with hundreds of attractive costume dressed young women from many countries - Singapore- Taiwan - Japan - China - Sth Korea - USA ,with eeryone having a wonderful time . A few men were dressed up albeit they didnt look anywhere as good as the women did. There is a changing of the Guard outside The Palace on a regular basis & the public are encouraged to have photos taken with the assembled Guards as they stand to attention outside The Palace Gate. More Photos with the lovely Cherry Blossom trees in the Palace Grounds & it was time to leave this picture paradise. Highly recommended & the best part of our time in this great city"
3494,5.0,Gyeongbpkgung is so beautiful and traditional. I think the best beautiful is the house behind the palace and some house middle the river. When I went there the water is bacame ice hahaah but it's look so beautiful.
3495,4.0,"I thought that this place was going to look like forbidden city, huge and all that. But It s not. This is a serene place with beautiful cherry blossom and scenic building.  Dont forget to watch the guard changing ceremony, it was pretty impressive.  And oh, free admission if you are wearing hanbok. So make sure you rent a hanbok nearby, there are so many choices."
3496,3.0,Nice stroll around Gyeongbokgung. Touristy thing to do... but we are indeed tourists. Decent gardens at the back.
3497,5.0,"This place is a must-see, especially if you want to learn more about Korean history. The palace itself is stunning, but you can feel more like a part of the korean history if you wear a hanbok (korean traditional clothes) which you can borrow from a nearby hanbok rental."
3498,4.0,Not knowing much of the Korean history the Gyeongbung palace is a nice visit..huge complex and with nice weather a god walk..
3499,5.0,The palace is well maintained and very clean. Impressed with the palace building and their history. Very nice place to take photos.
3500,4.0,Our tourist Guide told us a lot of the history of this place and we are so amused of the tale. I love the cherry blossom trees around the palace area. I just find it soulful roaming around at this wonderful place
3501,4.0,"Nestled in the city centre of Seoul was the beautiful palace of Gyeongbukgung. The cherry blossom was everywhere in the palace which turned it into charm and amazing! Travelling to the palace by using public transportation was very convenient, just outside Exit 5 of subway station. Make sure you take time to observe the guard shift change at the main gate - so amazing!"
3502,5.0,"Korea's last dynasty's palace(Joseon Dynasty). If you are a foreigner or first time visiting abroad born korean, you must visit this palace. Use a guided tour. You will learn and understand the construction and the design. Don't forget to visit the museum. You will see the Korea's then and now."
3503,5.0,"great! It was a national palace of Chosun dynasty. Although I am not an expert at architecture, i can feel the beauty of ancient asian tradition."
3504,3.0,"The palace complex is not the original one. The former complex was ransacked by the Japanese when they occupied the land. Work is in progress to restore the complex. In general, it is not the most beautiful palace I have ever seen. It's pale comparison to palaces in Japan. However, it should be one of the best options in Seoul especially it's close the Bukchon village where you can have combined walking tour."
3505,4.0,"This was the first palace built in the Joseon dynasty and is where the dynasty's 500-year history began. There are five remaining palaces in Seoul and Gyeongbokgung is the largest. The palace offers visitors a glimpse into the Joseon's royal culture, life and architecture. You can also visit the National Palace Museum (located near the entrance of the palace) to learn more about the Joseon royal culture. To learn about the Korean lifestyle in the past, you can visit the National Folk Museum of Korea. Be prepared for a long walk if you want to explore the entire palace area, it was so huge! I visited in spring 2017 and the palace garden was so beautiful with all the cherry blossom trees. If you wear a hanbok, you can enter for free. The changing of the guards ceremony is also not to be missed!"
3506,4.0,I visit at spring time when the flowers are blossoms. I recomend to rent a hanbok at street around the palace before enter the palace and feel like a royal family
3507,5.0,Beautiful. Peaceful!interesting!Worth to visit I can spend whole day here !thats how beautiful it is!
3508,4.0,The performance is great. It's wonderful to see how the traditions are preserved through such performances. The guards were very professional an didn't flinch even though tourists were all around them buzzing with cameras.
3509,4.0,"This is actually a palace complex since there are several palaces in the same area with the one in picture being located in a big pond while 2 other palaces are located on land. Very nice place to relax and enjoy the scenery in Seoul as even the surrounding area of the palace is nice with mountains, trees and modern buildings."
3510,5.0,"We were told by our Korean friends to wear Hanbok (Korean traditional clothing) and will get free entrance to Gyeongbokgung Palace. We rented 4 hours for 2 sets, total 30, 000 won near the palace. Many tourists and even locals wear the Hanbok in; we felt at ease. I would highly recommend to do so, great experience wearing Hanbok into palace and have a taste how the older times people have to manage."
3511,5.0,We enjoyed the Change of Guards ceremony prior to visiting the palace. It is a large area and we had a guided tour with English explanations that made it of much more value.
3512,5.0,Cool place to see while in Seoul. Took a 90 minute walking tour and wondered around afterward.  Tour guide was informative.
3513,5.0,We went to the palace for the free english guided tour... it was very informative and Kim was very helpful and nice. The palace was BEAUTIFUL! So much details and beauty on the palace and its entire neighborhood esp for the photo geeks out there! 🤗 it's a must visit place when visiting South Korea!
3514,4.0,"We visit the Palace as it is one of our plan to view the history of South Korea. The Gyeongbokgung Palace is a huge complex area. They keep the traditional ceremony in the complex, e.g. exchange guard ceremony. If you have time you can rent Korean traditional dress outside the Palace, and took picture surrounding the Palace. There is lake also near the Palace which is so quiet and calm. A very recommended place when you visit Korea."
3515,5.0,"The palace was amazing.Being the onset of spring,the trees at the palace was covered in beautiful blossoms"
3516,5.0,This is the biggest and most impressive temple in Seoul.  It has lots of different temples that are all beautiful.  You can easily spend a day walking round here.  A must do for a visit to Seoul.  It's also reasonably priced and there are lots of locals dressed up in traditional dress.
3517,5.0,We go there and rent hanbok to use in the place... There so much old building with traditional ornament... as i am architect i like this place an a building concept... there are a hole to make heater for the king's throne... we should be accompanied by a guide to the history and forms to explain of building...
3518,5.0,"Catch the changing of the guard ceremony at 10am. Nice place lots of photo opportunities. Lots of walking required. The largest imperial palace built in the 14th century Gyongbokgung Palace. There's a marvelous changing of the guard ceremony at 10am and if you come in traditional costume, you get an entrance fee discount!"
3519,4.0,The palace is beautiful and a great visit while in Seoul. At 2pm we were fortunate enough to see the guard shift at the palace entrance. Definitely an amazing experience.
3520,5.0,"We visited the palace on Sunday morning in early April, just when the cherry trees starting to blossoms. We saw many girls, boys, women and men walking around in their hanbok. It was such a pretty sight to see. It felt almost like we traveled back in time during the imperial time. Unforgettable time."
3521,5.0,"If you want to learn Korea's roots, the Gyeongbokgung Palace is an amazing spot.  Doing research, having an audio guide or a tour guide is a recommendation when you want to learn more of what you'll see in the palace & it is worth it. The architecture we saw was amazing and reminds us a tad of the Chinese culture as well. It is also an amazing spot for capturing photographs.  PS: I heard from our tour guide that if you rent & wear a Hanbok, you get free entrance to the palace. :)"
3522,3.0,"The reason why people flock to see this sight is because of it historical value. At the same time, they shot a popular korea novela here. But as my title mentions, not much to see except the changing of guards which happens only at 10am daily."
3523,5.0,This is a must-see for anyone visiting Seoul. Try to arrive on a weekday when it's not so crowded. Be sure to walk Sejongdaero and visit the statues of Admiral Yi Sun Shin and King Sejong as you approach the palace. Beautiful and historic.
3524,5.0,Beautiful architecture. huge space to walk. a must place to visit when you go to Seoul. Can rent their Hanbok traditional outfit and take pictures at the palace. Do go during the time of change of guards which will be around 12:30 - 1pm.
3525,4.0,Good place to visit for historical sightseeing. We visited the place in the morning and were intrigued when we saw ancient Korean dresses wore by both men and women.  The place is big which is good for strolling around enjoying the palaces and the lakes
3526,5.0,My husband and I had a chance to visit this palace. The grounds are very nice. Great spot for photography and learning about Korean culture and history. Have on closed toe shoes made for walking because some areas around the grounds are gravel or compact soil. Worth a visit when in Seoul!
3527,4.0,"We went Nov 2016; was a interesting, historical kind of visit. If you like museums, history and sight-seeing, you should visit. There were other palaces but we decided to visit this one as it is one of the most accessible, being close to central Seoul. Furthermore, after this, we walked to the Gwanghwamun Square where we could see the protests preparation (during the weekdays)!"
3528,5.0,Excellent English language tour by knowledgable guide. Also free entry to museum kept us occupied for a couple of hours with a visit to the excellent cafe.
3529,5.0,"After around 15 mins after each of the four guard changing ceremonies during the day, there is the option to dress up (for free) as a palace guard. You get a choice of up to 4 different robes etc. And you can have a group size of up to 6 where you can all go in together to wander around the main square area. The 5 minute restriction time starts when the last member of your group is dressed!!  We are loved this activity and we even had local korean students asking us to take selfies with them.  The palace itself is very beautiful and worth the entrance fee to wander around the grounds. The lake is particularly beautiful."
3530,5.0,One palace that should be visited is this one. Awesome blossoms and very beautiful!! Crowded but you still have your space.
3531,5.0,"Many of the buildings are restored with attention to the original. Make this a must-visit on your sightseeing agenda. There are a few free English speaking guides available. It is also one of the stops on sightseeing tours but they generally rush you, so I would recommend that you go on your own and enrich yourself with all the cultural and historical information. A Changing Of The Guards ceremony is particularly interesting. Nearby, also visit the Blue House, residence of the President."
3532,4.0,"This is such a nice and tranquil place where you have beautiful views, ambience, heritage, beauty of colors and calm waters all stiched together in one place where you can unwind and seek peace of mind. Amazing for photography too."
3533,4.0,"We were there to see the changing of the guards, in traditional outfits upon entering. Great place to take pictures. Grounds are very peaceful. Loved the ones dressed in traditional outfits, it adds to the experience. This also gets them free admission."
3534,5.0,"We could see cherry at the entrance of the Palace. The Palace is really big. Apart from different places or rooms you can see, the scenery inside is fantastic! I took a lot of photos of those beautiful scenes. It is really worth of paying 3000 won entry fee to have a look."
3535,4.0,historical place and worth to visit. get to know the history of Seoul and the Joseon Dynasty. wonderful building structures.
3536,4.0,Being here is like traveling back in time. Going through the palace you'll see and feel how they've lived.
3537,5.0,If you want go to another 3 palace and Jongmyo shrine better you but package for 4 palace and Jongmyo Shrine and you can go in 1 day from morning 9.00 AM (South Korea - Seoul time) take alot of picture
3538,5.0,There is an entertaining changing of the guards ceremony at certain time interval. You can took pictures with the guards too. An amazing historical palace to visit in Seoul.
3539,4.0,Great place to get the early history of Seoul and the Joseon Dynasty. Wonderfully restored buildings and grounds gives insight to what life was like during this time period. Get there for the changing of the guard ceremony as it is fascinating.
3540,5.0,"Walking on a Saturday afternoon with limited time, went to this palace, terrific, just 3,000 Wan and there is a good 3 hours f sightseeing to be had. Well worth the visit and the walk to get there down the long avenue."
3541,4.0,Worth a visit. It was spectacular in Autumn. This mostly re-constructed complex was historically interesting. The changing of the guards was contrived but entertaining enough. The real value was towards the back of the complex as the crowds thinned there were some very interesting buildings in the setting of beautiful deciduous trees which made for some great photos and memories.
3542,4.0,We went with family and explored this amazing palace and were not disappointed. Spring is the best time--mid-April when the flowers are blooming. Be sure to visit the museums--I preferred the National Folk museum as it showed a lot more of the Korean culture. There are free guided tours in several languages during the day that start near the information center that last about 1 hour but we found just reading the brochure and taking our time the best way to go.
3543,5.0,"This palace is the largest among the grand palaces built by the Joseon Dynasty; so obviously very important part of SK's history and culture. It's huge and very picturesque esp the time we visited. It was in January this year. It snowed the day before our arrival and flurry on the day of our visit, and it covered the palace with snow and was very pretty. The visitors, being winter, were fewer, and so we're able to take beautiful photos.  Also, the district where Gyeokbokgung Palace is located is my favorite. It's like the history and art district of Seoul. There were art museums, even the contemporary ones. Also it's near Bukchon Hanok Village.  I really want to visit again and take more photos. Whilst the snow/winter made the photos we took looked amazing, it also cut our visit short because S.Korea's winter can be brutally cold! The snow slowed us down also as it was very slipper to walk."
3544,4.0,"Except for central part of the palace, most were destroyed by fire or during the Japanese Invasion but be assure the rebuilding would take decades to complete.  It will not be as grand as the Forbidden Palace but you can imagine the king's simple lifestyle. My guide told me, the kings were rather short-lived, died around age of around 45+ and do not have time for romance like what we saw in the korean serial.  I spent an entire day here, joined guided tour in English as well as Chinese.Visited 2 free museums next to the palace as well."
3545,5.0,Not to miss if you are in Seoul historical area. This palace was the main residence of the king for several hundred years.  In front of the Gwangghwamum gate and in the inner courtyard you should also attend the guard changing ceremony provided at specific times. It lasts approx. 10 mins  It is recommended to get part of a free guided tour provided in several languages in order to learn about the historical aspect of the park and buildings .  During spring time the trees are starting to bloom and everything becomes beautiful.  The entry fee of 3000W (approx. 3$) is very reasonable.
3546,5.0,"Make sure you stop by at the entrance of the metro in front of the palace in order to get some free traditional garb to wear. Bring an ID to leave with them. Attend the free guided tours. English was at 9am, 1130am, and 130pm. It begins right through the main gate on the right after where you have your tickets checked.  It gets sunny! Bring sunglasses and some water."
3547,5.0,"If i have a foreign frind ,I would take him or her to this place. This is because this place is one of our outstanding heritages in Korea and you can see the intact palace in the middle of city. Also,you can see the performances in the palace at certain times. There are guide services, which offer at certain times. You should check out the time on the website."
3548,5.0,"It is very near to Insadonf, Buchon. Walked non stop with rented Hanbok that gave free admission to a lot of UNESCO Sites. Inviting and great royal feel in the architecture and cleverly constructed engineering around us."
3549,5.0,Interior of palace is a bit sparse but still a nice palace to stroll through.b Definitely go for the audio guide (only krw 3000) which will make it more meaningful. Beware that you have to leave your ID as collateral for the audio device. I was a bit hesitant to leave my passport but all went well. Maybe try offering them a lesser form of ID like drivers LIC.
3550,5.0,Beautiful big palace with many sections that have been well preserved. We were lucky to have gone there on a nice sunny day. A few trees have cherry blossoms already.
3551,5.0,"A palace strongly reminiscent of the Forbidden City in Beijing, spread out over a large area with many different buildings. They have been nicely restored and you are free to wander about. There are many displays with information in a few languages, including English, so you can get a good idea of the history."
3552,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace was amazing. We got there just in time for the changing of the guard, which was much cooler than I expected. The throne room was the most impressive thing I saw in the entire country. A must visit if you're in Seoul."
3553,4.0,It was a pleasant experience. We even got to see the changing of the guards. Cons is only when we visited there are a lot of tourists as well so the place was too crowded and its hard to get solo pictures.
3554,5.0,Beautiful big palace with many sections that have been well preserved. Be well prepared with good walking shoes. Tourists can rent beautiful traditional Hanbok/king costumes to wear around the palace to get the feel of the olden times. We were lucky to have gone there on a nice sunny day. A few trees have cherry blossoms already. Stroller rental available too. A must visit for all tourists.
3555,4.0,nice n beatutiful palace in clear cool seoul.. we went there in winter... so this big palace look stunning with the snow on its ground...and the white mountain as background..
3556,2.0,Nothing much to see unless you're into history and such. Guards changing ceremony was mediocre too. A few scenic spots and that's it.
3557,5.0,Admittance was very affordable. Tour guide services was available and courteous who knew a plethora of languages. Bathrooms were very clean. Plenty of opportunities to take photos. Very serene and interesting. A must visit!
3558,5.0,Large Palace with several courtyards and structures to visit. A great way to spend a few hours exploring.
3559,4.0,"It is a touristy attraction, changing of the guard has commentary via PA system in english, which makes the ceremony just a parade for tourists, but the palace complex is very nice and well maintained, incl. the museum."
3560,4.0,Great heritage site to intake Korean history with a full standing historic site. The buildings and Architecture are interesting and a good look to understand more of how royals lived in ancient times. Spent approx 1.5 hours. Able to rent some olden day costumes to enhance your experience. Suggest to link it up with insadong and bukchan.
3561,5.0,"Massive complex of the restored palace, still a work in progress, but it is a lovely place. Huge area, museum just outside the grounds, easy to get to. Large numbers of people, but after you pass by the first buildings, it appears almost deserted. Buildings are quite beautifully done. Many areas make for lovely photos.  Honestly, after a while it all tends to blur into on and another, as it all starts to look the same, but still a must see if you are in Seoul."
3562,3.0,"You can visit this place when in Seoul, but everything is recently rebuilt. You don't see an old palace, it's a fake."
3563,5.0,"I was planning the palace in the morning, but an accident waste 3 hrs. Basically, I searched for the palace name in one of the most famous map app and blindly follow the direction. The app took me on a train for almost 2 hrs before I realized that it's taking me to a different place. So I recommend anyone who plans to just follow an app suggestion to double check.  Anyway, I finally made it to the palace, and fortunate at the exact time to see the guard change. A must visit place in Seoul."
3564,4.0,Make sure you are there 15 min before they open 9am and go through the carpark entrance (right side street) you will see all the guards getting ready to start. Do not forget to rent a traditional custom for the fabulous pictures.. there's a lot of places near where you can rent them.
3565,3.0,"The overall palace ground is beautiful and its like a step into the past. However, the place is crowded with tourist and was quite noisy especially at the area around the main hall. The visit would be more worthwhile if visitor were allowed to enter into the buildings as most buildings are off limits to visitor and we were only allowed to view from the outside. Aside from that, there should be more description about the history of each buildings ."
3566,5.0,Entering the palace is like leaving the frenzy of Seoul outside and entering a place of quietness. Due to the policy of allowing free entrance if you appear in traditional Korean clothes enhances the atmosphere of entering a different world. The palace has very beautiful buildings giving a very good impression how the Korean Royal family lived and governed the country.
3567,5.0,"This was one of the highlights of our time in Seoul. It was easy to get to (unlike many attractions in Seoul) and we were more enchanted by it the more we walked around the grounds. There is more to see than you would expect and the photo opportunities are endless, particularly on a sunny day. We were lucky enough to see a procession come through which heightened the sense of tradition and culture. Definitely worth putting aside half a day for, especially as it's free.  Just don't go on a Tuesday, as it's closed!"
3568,5.0,"The place we visited is called Gyeongbok Palace & Folklore Museum, but Trip Advisor does not have an exact listing. Built in 1394 as the main palace of the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910), the compound features typical rooms (women and men's quarters were separated), offices, meeting halls, works of art, funerary objects and items of daily life (including huge earthen pots for kim-chee, preserved cabbage)."
3569,4.0,I like the palace. If you like history you will enjoy being there but you don't need more than 20 minutes
3570,5.0,Great place to understand Korean culture and history. If you get lucky enough or well organise try to visit it at the same time as the guards show The palace is well maintained and there are free guided tours which gives you lots of information I strongly recommend this palace if you have only time for one
3571,3.0,Lots of walking and lots of dull looking palace buildings. It'd be more interesting if there were more English signboards explaining the history of the building. I guess this is how tour guides make money. Do try to dress up in traditional Korean clothing but you have to arrive early to get a costume. Guard changing happens at certain hours. That's interesting to see. Exit at the Korean national folk museum to get to Hanok village.
3572,5.0,Great place to visit. A ticket gets you in to three attractions making it very inexpensive. Very interesting place!
3573,4.0,I went on tuesday and didn't browsing before go. And what i found it was closed on tuesday ㅠㅠ Couldn't see gyeongbokgung inside just i spend time around this palace. Amaze with architecture and location on center of city. Next time i will come again not on tuesday
3574,4.0,"Given the historical significance this is certainly worth ONE visit, but otherwise I was not that impressed."
3575,4.0,It's beautiful. The best thing about it for me was that if you are wearing traditional Honbok of Korea they let you in without a ticket so you see many people walking around in the traditional Korean clothes
3576,5.0,"This place is a must see. Do not be in a rush, you can spend a lot of time walking around and seeing all the beautiful buildings. There are plaques everywhere so you can read about the history of the palace."
3577,5.0,"We came on the last Wed of March so entry was free, but the entry fee isn't expensive anyway. The grounds are large so even though there were lots of visitors it didn't feel crowded. We enjoyed taking photos by the pond, and there were lots of people in Korean dress which added to the atmosphere.  We found the gate to the road in front of the Presidential Palace (Blue House) by chance - just look for the security guards at the far end of the complex. We also enjoyed watching the changing of the guard at 2pm, those guys must have a hard time ignoring all the visitors who get photographed beside them!"
3578,4.0,It is a good place to visit if you want to know the History of the Korean King and Queen. It is a huge place to roam around and it can be tiring as well
3579,5.0,"The palace is worth a visit atleast half a day and looks different depending on the season. In winter one can see frozen lakes inside the palace. The best way to see and know the palace is through free tours offered by Korea tourism board where you can book just a day in advance in their website. Palace has got a Rich history with separate kings and queens living places. Also you will most photographed spot in the palace where new wedding couple, kids take photo sessions. Don't miss the parade infront of the palace. National museum just outside the palace is good to visit for around 2 hours. Observe the dragons placed on top of the palace structure and paper windows. Also learn about underground heating system used during those times in the palace."

3581,5.0,A massive place to walk around. Lots of history. Lots of photo shots. Wednesday was free entry! It's quite close to the hotels. This place should be number one on your sightseeing list!
3582,3.0,"Is an eye opener as the palace is quite different compare to the China Forbidde city. 无论是规模还是气派，整个宫殿都没有北京故宫的气势恢宏, 而是崇尚自然的园景。"
3583,5.0,This place is incredibly beautiful from entrance to the end. There is an entrace fee but it is worth it. You have a free museum right next to it and many spots to get beautiful pictures.
3584,4.0,"pros: - a great place to learn about Korean historical site - great place for photos, walking around - dont miss the event of changing guard (traditional guard). please check the schedule - the location is nearby metro railway - you can see sakura if you're at the right time  cons: - mostly are open areas, so dont forget to bring umbrellas and rain coat during rainy day - you need to pay for entrance - there are several location that may be troublesome for someone who is using wheelchair. - no proper restaurant within the palace. there is only one small coffeshop which can be easily packed with people - theres only one small gift shop within the palace - most areas within the palace are covered in dirt (not all covered with stone floor). so during a windy day can bring a lot of sand and dust. if you're allergic to sand and dust dont forget to bring mouth and nose cover. - it requires walking within the palace. theres no transportation inside palace"
3585,4.0,We went in winter and it provided the most romantic backdrop for me and my husband. it felt like it was our second honeymoon. We also managed to catch the change of guards ceremony and appreciated the english commentary explaining the actions of the guards.
3586,5.0,We visited Gyeongbokgung Palace is the most important Palace and depicts history from the 15th - 18 century . The floors were heated to keep the royal family comfortable. The site is very large with numerous buildings and areas to explore . I would wear comfortable walking shoes and plan 2 hours to visit the whole site . This palace is located in the heart of Seoul . We visited on a Saturday which I would try to avoid . For 17 straight Saturday's there have been very large peaceful protest in support of the former President who was impeached and removed from office . These caused large traffic slowdowns and I would avoid unless you want to see democracy at work in South Korea . Gyeongbokgung Palace is a example of Korean history that was on my must see list .
3587,5.0,"Although everything has been rebuilt given the fact that it was all destroyed by conquering nations, this was a wonderful quiet and tranquil place that was in the middle of Seoul. What was most interesting to see so many young people that came dressed in old traditional costumes. Take your time and see everything."
3588,4.0,"Conveniently located at Gyeongbokgung Station, we arrived at around 10 am to catch the changing of the guards ceremony (10 am/ 11 am/ 1 pm/ 2 pm) - it only lasted for about 15 minutes or so, but was definitely very insightful. We bought our admission tickets (free for 65+) and went into the main palace. We joined the English speaking tour and our tour guide was very knowledgeable, providing us with insights into the history of South Korea and the palace."
3589,5.0,"Two thumbs up! Place to visit for tourists. The palace has some exhilarating views; lagoon, mountain, the modern buildings as back drop. One must avail a map and translator to help you go around the place. Would be advisable to bring comfortable shoe wear as the place is huge. There are also for rent traditional costumes nearby for the tourists for pictorial purposes."
3590,5.0,Went here in the morning to catch changing of royal guard ceremony. Lots of tourist at this time. This palace is big so you need to allot more time to look around. Wear comfy shoes & prepare yourself for a walkathon😉
3591,4.0,I was planning to join a half-day tour of the palace but realized the hop-on-hop-off bus stopped not far from it. Go in the morning to avoid the crowds. Don't miss the changing of the guards. It's a nice recreation. The grounds are pleasant to walk around. But there were too many tourists dressed in the Korean national outfits. A bit too cheesy for me.
3592,5.0,I recommend to visit the palace when you are wearing old korean cloth and take a photo graph. the photograph will be one of your favorite.
3593,4.0,"Sprawling area with huge gates, stairs, separate zones for the military and the illiterate. Statues that depict some humour can be found in the compound.  Heated floors have also been thought of to keep the King and his family and staff warm.  A historical site, good to spend some time. Best use a guided tour or the audio guide to gain more insights.  Worth the visit but need to wear good walking shoes as the grounds are massive."
3594,5.0,"Gyeongbokgun palace is definitely a place to learn and feel Korean history and culture. Guide was explaining very good, in detail. I wish I had more time there"
3595,4.0,Unfortunately most of what is original to Korea has had to be rebuilt. The lack of authenticity was excused when so many of the tourists visitinnworebtradional clothing. It is an interesting walkin museum
3596,5.0,"Viaited this palace in mid-March 2017 with my wife. We arrived at 2 PM and managed to watch the guard changing ceremony. We toured the palace with the free walking tour. Our guide, Mr. Chang, was very friendly, nice and knowledgable. The palace complex was huge. It took us around 2 hours to complete the tour. Different sections gave me different feelings. The main gate, the courtyard and the main palace building awed me. The beautiful pavillion at the back was so serene. Considering the relatively cheap ticket price and the whole experience, it was totally worth it."
3597,4.0,Such a beautiful location. We learnt a lot about the history of Korean royals. Would highly recommend taking the walking tour.
3598,4.0,"Just like the other palace, you will see older building and not too many surprise ! But it is very good culture learning and beautiful gardening . We were there a bit too early , the weather is very cold. Suggest visit Korea after March ."
3599,5.0,"In Seoul city there are near about four Kings Palace. Among them the Gyeongbokgung Palace is the most important, centrally located and covers a larger area. The heritage palace is nicely maintained and depicts the Korean history from the 15TH TO 18TH Century. Please visit the palace prior to 4 pm otherise you cant by ticket to enter inside the palace"
3600,5.0,"Let me tell you first, that the entrance fee to this place is only 3,000 krw (less than $3). This is incredibly cheap, considering how vast and large this place is. Also, if you rent and wear a hanbok from any hanbok rental shop near the palace, your entrance fee is FREE.  I really recommend going here with a tour guide because it's really incredible listening to the history behind each building and architectural element, starting from the ondol floor heating technology dating back to the Joseon era, to the different symbolisms embedded into the walls, floors, and roofs of the palace. Much of the palace was destroyed by the Japanese forces during the Japanese occupation, and some buildings have still not been restored. You can also visit the residence and deathplace of Queen Myeongseong, who was assassinated by the Japanese in the 1900s.  I would say Gyeongbokgung takes a good 2 hours to fully look around. But definitely, Gyeongbokgung is a must-visit for any travelers wanting to experience the history of Korea."
3601,5.0,"I'm a Kdrama fan and finally traveled to South Korea with the hopes of visiting significant places that are always shown in a drama. I don't know why but I'm into Saguek kind of drama with Kings (Wang) and Crown Princes (Seja) as the main characters. That is why my first stop is the Gyeongbukgong palace. I was imagining as i was there how the entourage of the king of about 20 or almost, would follow him wherever he goes and when he talks to any of his concubines let's say outside of their quarters, those entourage will look the other way and pretend not to hear anything. Although the palace was flocked by tourists everyday, i'm glad i was able to see it and its beautiful garden. I went there last autumn season and the trees were very colorful, needless to say, a sight for sore eyes. Just take the subway in going there. You can go down Gyeongbukgong station, which is the nearest to the palace or go down Gwangwamun station and see first Statues of King Sejong and admiral Yi in Gwangwamun square then head straight to the gates of Gwangwamun then the palace itself. The famous Cheonggyecheon stream is also nearby. Since i was traveling solo, selfies overload was what happened. Anyways i enjoyed every minute of it. Turns out it wasn't boring traveling solo afterall.😊"
3602,5.0,"The highlight of my visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace is the Changing of the Guards ceremony. Make sure to schedule your visit or watch out for the actual changing of the guards schedule while you are the the vicinity of the palace. It is an experience that you will not regret! You may even take a picture or a video while the ceremony is taking place. Walking distance from the Gwanghwamun Square. Don't miss this on your trip to Seoul, South Korea!"
3603,3.0,Tour guide did a good job showing my friends around. Good time management and good explanation. Were really having a good time and will totally bring my friend here again. Winter time is the best to visit such place.
3604,4.0,"This place is accessible via subway (Gyeongbokgung Station) and follow the signs for the exits.  There is an open area for you to take pictures at the main entrance if you just want a keep sake with some of the palace architecture in the background. However, if it is you first time, I would recommend paying a small fee to enter to see the entire palace ground at least once.  This place is huge so be prepared to walk around a lot. But every corner was mesmerising. Especially if you're into those period dramas - you could picture what it was like in those days because some of the buildings have actual furniture (chairs, beds, vases, books, shelves etc.) so you get to see what the rooms might have looked like in the past.  There is security around so it is pretty safe. If you're going in the day, bring your sunglasses because this place has lots of bare sandy ground and can get quite bright.  Lots of photo ops and you can rent hanboks nearby to really blend in and get into the period atmosphere if you'd like. If you'd like a shot without too many tourists in the picture, there are many secluded spots towards the back of the palace. They have guided tours too that will help you to learn more about the history.  In all, I would recommend to visit this place at least once."
3605,4.0,"My wife and I decided to visit the Gyeongbokgung Palace yesterday morning to acquaint ourselves with some culture and history of this vibrant nation of South Korea.  We took a cab there for convenience instead of going by subway.  We went there early at 9.30am because we wanted to witness the Ceremony of Gate Guard Change. This is held twice everyday at 10am and 2pm except on Tuesday when the palace is closed. The guards in full ancient soldier attire will march into the royal courtyard to the accompaniment of a marching band comprising, drums, trumpets and cymbals. It's quite spectacular to watch . This was the highlight of our tour . As for the palace tour , it is not as grand as what I have seen in China by comparison.  There is an entry fee of 3,000 won per person and seniors above 65 enter free of charge . So if you are a senior don't forget to bring along your passport to show your age to qualify for the free entry."
3606,4.0,"Is was wonderful to visit here , during winter time and u can see the ground is all cover with snow , very cold and I enjoy the scenery here and people here all are very friendly ."
3607,5.0,Visited the palace on a Sunday many korean people dressed in taraditional costumes. The palace is very grand and steeped with history. There are so many beautiful sections to see in apeacful environment.
3608,5.0,I definitely recommend visiting the palace wearing a hanbok. It adds quite an authentic look to your photos! Join the free tour which starts at the information center near the main gate. But join the earlier schedule so you won't be rushed in the afternoon as they close on time. The guards were shooing us away as we were still taking photos. We had to keep on running and stop for a bit to continue taking photos when the guards were busy shooing other visitors! Worth the visit only if you join the tour as this would give you an idea why and how the whole place came to be.
3609,4.0,"One of must visit palace in seoul. Their palace sure are huge.. but this is the hugest palace and need lot of walk. for me once is enough, I walked for over two hours there. But very nice experience.. Maybe will bring my family for tour, but personally i won't come back by myself. its easy to get lost"
3610,5.0,"This is a don't miss experience for any tourist in Seoul. The palace grounds are extensive and the thing to be sure you don't miss is the changing of the guard ceremony, which occurs several times during the day. It's bright and colorful and occurs just outside the gate between the palace walls and the bus parking on the east side. You can hear the drums from anywhere inside, but they do block the entrance for awhile as the guard passes....the best photo spot in between the parade grounds and the bus park. There's not a whole lot else to do inside the palace but do walk it and get a feeling for the grandeur of times past."
3611,4.0,"Here is the large palace and it is big enough, there are the lake, garden, trees and the location is in city. We can go here using public transportation such us train, bus or taxi"
3612,5.0,Nicely maintained and serene atmosphere. People who have visited many indian palaces would find it too plain .. but worth the short time it takes to complete the same. enjoy
3613,4.0,If you are limited for time then of the main tourists sites this would be my recommendation for the one to do. Located within easy walking distance of City Hall the palace is a juxtaposition of the surrounding modern buildings. Very relaxing to take a stroll around the grounds and when we visited in early afternoon the reflections of some of the buildings on the water were stunning. It is also worthwhile taking in the National Palace Museum which is located near the main entrance and is free to enter after you have paid your initial entrance fee of KRW3K. Great value for money and a wonderful place to great away from the hubris of the City and see the locals ( and some foreigners) dressing up in local costumes.
3614,5.0,"A beautiful historic site. Similar in layout to Forbidden City in Beijing but on a smaller scale. Beautifully restored and maintained buildings. This site must not be missed on any visit to Seoul. Not suitable for mobility challenged as considerable walking is required and some stairs. Folk museum is on site with excellent exhibits, gift shop and washrooms."
3615,5.0,"Every time I've been to Seoul on business trip, I go to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace with different people from my countries. We usually have no tourist guide and our people are not good at English as well as Korean so I have to introduce them about this palace by myself. The more I visit this palace, the more I feel how great it is. Even it was burnt down once but Korean people rebuilt and re-act all the activity so people can understand what happened there several hundred years ago. It's also very good place to take a walk then you can enjoy very nice food so called Samgyetang at a very famous restaurant nearby. It's really nice place for visiting at any time of the year."
3616,4.0,"The place itself was amazing! it's combined with nature and a very exquisite design..it was a great place to take pictures and to go if you're wearing hanbok. yes, i was there and wore hanbok. The pictures and the traditional place was a match made in heaven! You should try!..if you're into the architecture and design, this place is for you. but I guess they're trying to build up the new building when was there."
3617,3.0,This used to be the main palace but many of the original buildings were burnt down. Nothing much to see except the pond and the little pavilion here. You can either purchase a single ticket for this palace or a combined ticket for all 4 palaces. All the palaces are connected. A secret garden is a must to see.
3618,5.0,"This place is on a defifnite must-do list if it's your first time to Seoul! Filled with so much culture and history, you need to come here! Beautiful in the fall and the spring (but I also went in the summer and sweated and still had fun), it's a must-do in Seoul."
3619,5.0,"Brings back memories of Korean dramas, not so big grounds, easy to walk around, good outing site for a bit of fresh air in a metropolitan city."
3620,4.0,"This is like the main palace in Seoul. Although it is very crowded with tourists, and this is the second time I've visited the place, I am still awed by the structure and how one can experience history in these modern times. It is inexpensive to enter and you can enter the museum for free."
3621,5.0,"Honestly, I had no time to walk around the palace i just walk only outside of palace but i could say i miss this that i did not go inside anyway even outside it really nice place, unique i recommend you to visit"
3622,5.0,"We went here late afternoon and spent atleast an hour. On our way to the palace, we passed by a group of uniformed students who offers FREE TOUR of the palace. We took that tour and it was nice of them to assist us from were to buy tickets to the palace which is 3,000 won to where is the best spot to take a photo of the palace. The tour is very informative and enlightening about the Joseon Dynasty.  Tips: 1. If you rent a Hanbok, you can have free access/entrance on the palaces. A lot of tourist local/foreign wore hanbok inside the palace.  2. Take the free tour offered by the students  Direction: Take Metro Line 3 Orange Line. Get off at Gyeongbokgung Station and take Exit 5. Walk straight ahead until you pass by the museum.  Palace is closed every Tuesday"
3623,5.0,"This place is so beautiful with unique building. I can feel korean historical culture there. I love this place soooo much. Of course, wanna visit there again one day."
3624,4.0,"A nice palace in the city with some photos spot. Don't forget to bring your camera with you as there are some other places of interest located nearby Gyeongbokgung Palace too. Easy to find and only few minute walk from Anguk Station. Went there on early March with cold weather, the palace was crowded with tourist and many people wear traditional dress. Entrance fee is KRW 3,000 per person."
3625,5.0,This Palace located near the hotel we stayed so we decided to visit it once. It was a great place to get to know about the Korean's history. You might need half day to complete this place. A beautiful place to see if you travel to Korea!
3626,5.0,"Great to visit , cheap 3000 Won ( <3$) , tranquil, mountains one side & the city the other. Nice to stroll round & reflex."
3627,4.0,"The traditional buildings were very beautiful and interesting to see. The changing of the guard ceremony was also nice to see. There were lots of Korean young women in traditional dress, which was fun. I visited before spring had really gotten started, so the grounds were still brown for winter. I can imagine the grounds would be quite beautiful for walking in the spring as things start to get green."
3628,4.0,there is a small pond or lake inside this huge property  palace is actually small but lots of open areas for walking  security staff aplenty
3629,5.0,I recommend seoul city tour. Excellent guides. Beware travelling on any Saturday. They are protesting against/for the S korean President. The traffic was literally deadlocked after 2pm.
3630,3.0,It is okay for photoshoot. People came and rent Hanbok for nice pictures. The place are huge and need up to 4 hours to explore the whole place.
3631,4.0,"We didn't learn that much as we didn't have a guide. Nonetheless, it's a nice thing to walk through if you're in the area. If you have no special interest in old buildings then leave it out if you're on a short visit. I would personally then climb a mountain instead."
3632,5.0,"This is a great place to make beautiful photos and enjoy the local culture. You will need a lot of walking, but it's nice. I wish I took more photos. But I have a great time and memories."
3633,4.0,The Palace was easy to go via the train.. the buildings were awesome and so old but well maintained. Amenities like toilets are clean.
3634,5.0,"Come and get the feeling of being in a place that hundreds of years ago the living history of the country were walking around. Great feeling, beautiful palace and landscape"
3635,5.0,"You can't visit Korea without seeing this palace and witnessing the changing of the guards. Rich history and amazing architecture. I thought travelling at winter time would be a problem, but it ended up perfect, lesser crowd for one and nice to walk around when it's not hot."
3636,3.0,"Besides the main palace and the man-made lake, there's really not much to see here. Lots of empty space. Be sure to wear sunblock when visiting in summer. The National Folk Museum is in the palace if you're into museums. Changgyeonggung Palace and Changdeokgung palace while smaller, are much more interesting in my opinion. There is much more to see and appreciate in these palaces than Gyeongbokgung."
3637,5.0,"The palace is very large and is broken down into several sections depending on where you stand in life. Meaning Royalty, servants, and others. Royals also have several house within palace for safety reasons. And whT animals on the roof means and color of roof means. Your need a guided tour to learn everything."
3638,4.0,"either stroll around or, what I prefer, just sit and take in the scenery, let you thoughts do the walking and relax in the middle of a busy city"
3639,4.0,"Missed this historical landmark and attraction with our first visit last year. Didn't want to make the same mistake this time! We were able to walk from the hanok we were renting to the south gate of the palace. The changing of the guards ceremony welcomed us which was fascinating to watch (It occurs four times daily). Afterwards, we toured the grounds and different restored structures and buildings - all beautiful particularly the lakes and landscaping around the buildings ! We spent most of the time in the National Folk Museum where it was not only WARM, it was marvelously arranged by themes and organized with facinating exhibits! Highly recommend!"
3640,5.0,"This place is great for walking. It is big and beautiful. And so oriental.  And there were a lot of young girls in national dresses.  There is not only a palace, but also a park with lake. And nice trees."
3641,5.0,The show is worth to see. Very traditional Korea. Highly recommended . Interesting place and a lot of tourist. Easy access on parking. Ticket entrance very affordable
3642,5.0,"Nice historic palace. The guide came free: very knowledgeable and friendly. We booked the guide online before going, and she arrived punctually and gave us an hours tour"
3643,4.0,"We are so happy to heony moon at South Korea, we just only say 4 days at Seoul, whatever you go, you can see the yellow and red tree, look so romantic, you can take MTR easy to join the trip, there a lot of shopping hall, and the things is cheaper, we try to eat their Korea food of the （Gejang）soy sauce of crab, the crab did't cook, they clean the crab after they catch, put them in their soy sauce at less 7 days, this is my first time to eat the fresh crab, it's sweet and the sauce is good, the higlight you must put the rice in the raw crab, mix together eat, it's was delicious! The set for it many other side dishes see attach photo, 20000 won only."
3644,5.0,"This is the biggest palace and a must see when in Seoul and very picturesque. The architecture was grand, so ancient, and very impressive. The gardens were very relaxing and lovely in Autumn. Don't miss the changing of the guards ceremony at the main gate entrance at 10 am- 4 PM hourly. Highly recommend the free guided English tour offered daily at 11 AM, gives you insight into different aspects of the architecture and culture. The Korean Folk Museum inside was very neat if you are interested in Korean history and the the different Monarch's. Autumn was lovely time to visit. The palace grounds are so nicely maintained and very safe. I was there at the end of November and it was comfortable in layers during the day. Palaces close at 5 so dress warmly if you plan to be out and about in the evening."
3645,5.0,This palace is one of the largest and most precious ones in Korea. It is really easy to approach in Seoul.
3646,5.0,"Gyungbok palace is one of the MUST visit places if you want to have a tour in Seoul. if you compare with forbiden city in Peiking, feeling is very different with that one. It will be interesting to compare two different palace. Walking along the main building to the backside ponds with Queen's place, you can feel from the enormous authority to the relaxed calmness. Good fun with Korean traditional cloth,Hanbok, you can have free pass if you rent a cloth and enter the palce wearing Hanbok. This will give you much fun with good memorial photo. As Korea has 4 distintive seasons, different seasonal visiting will provide you totally different feeling as well."
3647,4.0,One of recommended palace in seoul you can go there with subway to gyeongbokgung station. There is a change of guard ceremony every day at 10 am don't miss it.
3648,4.0,"An ancient castle, huge and amazing, very unique design and artful. Also here we can see how Korea perform the ceremony the royal army escort door replacement is carried out."
3649,4.0,"It was in same place with korean folk museum. Check to close day, in my opinion best time to go there is april or may, its so cold in winter and there is no flower"
3650,4.0,Worth to go to Gyeongbokgung for sightseeing and for quick photo-taking. Will be much nicer if tourists choose to sightsee during autumn season.  Attraction fee for each adult is KRW 3000. Tourists may purchase the one-day pass which includes the entry of all Korean palaces.
3651,5.0,"I visited this palace twice, once in the summer and another during winter and I can say that both experiences were amazing, since the scenery of lakes and trees makes the place very different. My only advice is during winter wear warm clothes with layers, protect your hands and head and enjoy the tranquility of this place. There is a change of guard at 10:00am every day with narration so the visitors will understand what the ceremony is about. Arrive a few minutes early to get a good spot to see it. There are other times during the day, check in the website. I bought the ticket next to the main gate and I also got the booklet with information. There are tours in several languages but I did not want to wait for the English tour that would start at 11:00am and just wondered on my own. It is very busy but don't get intimidated with the crowds. If you start the tour from from the back, you miss all the tours and have a lot of peace and quiet. I just wandered for 2 hours, contemplating, taking pictures and watching people. Some girls rent the Korean dress called hanbok to enter the palaces for free and it's nice to see them walking about in the palace it makes you wonder what life must be like in the old days. You also can use your ticket to enter the National Folk Museum of Korea."
3652,4.0,"Majority of the palaces may looked the same. But to me, the story is of the palace is the one thing that makes a difference to it - main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty built in 1395. The change guard ceremony was interesting! Recommend to make time to watch it. It happens at every hour from 10am-4pm (please check again before you visit)."
3653,5.0,Decided to hike to the top of the tower and was not disappointed by the view. There are buses and cabs that you can take if you don't want to do the hike.
3654,4.0,This is one of several palaces in Seoul that provides a very interesting look in to Joseon dynasty history. Fascinating very large grounds with many buildings. We made it for the am guard changing ceremony. The ceremony takes place a couple of times a day and is a nice addition to the regular palace tour. Make sure to visit the national foll museum next to the palace grounds for an even more in depth look in to Korean history and culture.
3655,5.0,You can't skip coming to see the Palace if you visit Seoul. History at your fingertips. highly recommended
3656,4.0,This palace is beautiful and a very big property. Wear good walking shoes as you will walk a lot and not all surfaces are even. Changing of the guards was fun to see as well
3657,5.0,Fascinating building and premises. Only spent 10 minutes. Got there late. Palace closes at 5pm. Took some wonderful photos there.
3658,5.0,"Beautiful Palace tour with One Day Korea. This is a very historic palace in South Korea, definitely a must see while in Seoul."
3659,4.0,"If you have any difficulty walking or with stairs this is not for you. The buildings are all roped off, so the most you can do is climb to the top of the steps and look in. The changing of the guard at the gate which happens multiple times a day is worth the visit as is the museum which is next door."
3660,3.0,We went to Gyeongbokgung Palace on the coldest day so it was freezing walking around. We were only there for 30 mins. The palace is smaller than I expect but The story behind it is interesting. Coming to the palace in early Feb is not recommended.
3661,5.0,"Our visit here started with watching the changing of the gaurds ceremony at 10AM. We weere lucky to watch it as it was quite freezing weather and at some point , in severe weather the ceremony is cancelled. The palace itself is a complex of beautiful palaces demonstaring the maginifecnt architecture and are a must-see whie in Seoul."
3662,5.0,Some old surrounded by new in Seoul. Come at the right time and you will see a crowd watching some happenings at the front gate. Shame you have to pay to get in though.
3663,5.0,"The place was very beautiful because of the view with the mountain,ponds with fish..its interesting to come when spring season...im going there on summer still beauty, the places also open midnight but hard to get the ticket on midnight... go here if you want to watch the guard ceremony changing, it amazing, here also near to insadong and also cheodukgung palace and blue house, museum of kotemporary also there and musuem art king joseon also around there...may spend all day there."
3664,5.0,This is a large complex of palace buildings with a two museums attached. There are some rooms which are furnished. We saw the changing of the guard ceremony. Lots to look at and do. This is manly outdoor - but the museums give a chance to go indoors.
3665,5.0,"You will not only be amazed by the decors of each part of the Palace , you will actually be amazed by how the Korean people are proud of and how they have been able to preserve their heritage ... something we Filipinos can learn from..."
3666,5.0,"To know Korea from its core. It is unique in its style from those of China, and Japan. Chinese's is a castle in itself, and Japanese's is a fortress, indicating the nation's monarchaic living style while Korean is more of an living quarters with low walls and not much luxury."
3667,4.0,""" this place is very near our hotel, we were able to go by just walking, we really enjoyed taking pictures of the palace, in fact i made it as my profile picture' background""."
3668,3.0,not that great - unless you get those costumes and take pics. not enough info available on the diffrent sights station and the book is not informative enough.
3669,5.0,"Last time in june 2013 , i didn't get enough time to explore the whole palace. Now in january 2017, i can get fulfilled my wish to explore the whole palace. It was really awesome place to get know history of korean."
3670,5.0,"Go on a nice day and enjoy the home of former kings and queens. The extensive palace grounds and buildings take a couple of hours to get through, and they're totally worth your time. The architecture is impressive and varied, the gardens are beautiful and seasonal, and the mountains in the background are breathtaking. The entire place represents old Korea so well. If you take kids, they can run around outside which is nice too! It can be exceptionally busy, so be prepared to gently elbow your way through the busy areas. The subway access is good, and there's a museum attached to the station which I didn't visit but heard was good."
3671,5.0,"This palace is absolutely huge and you can easily spend you whole day there. I didn't see the change of the guard but heard it's a must see and will definitely get to it next time. There are so many beautiful pictures you can take of the place, this is a must see for anyone who visits South Korea."
3672,4.0,"Was there for the change of guard ceremony which was impressive. Otherwise didn't enter the palace ground per se but walked at its parameter which allowed views inside, which was at that point of time just okay. Maybe due to the late fall weather."
3673,5.0,Very nice historical place to visit. What arrived the Guard change was interesting to look at with national dressing
3674,5.0,The history of Seoul is so unique and the people are extremely friendly. Very safe area. Lots of ex pats in down town.
3675,5.0,The Palace is big and it is worth witnessing the change of the guard ceremony that happens multiple times during the day.
3676,5.0,We began our visit at the Palace with the changing of the guard ceremony. I highly recommend being at the Palace in time to see this ceremony. It was so interesting to watch and afterwards you have an opportunity to have your picture taken with one of the guards. So fun!
3677,5.0,"The changing of the guard was really awesome to watch! If you're planning on going to Gyeonbokgung which I personally think is a must, be there during those times. I think there's a 10am and 2pm session and it goes on for 20 minutes. The queen's chamber was also a very interactive experience. We had to take our shoes off before going in and we were allowed to look around. It was probably the best thing there!"
3678,5.0,"This is such a peaceful and beautiful destination to visit if you are in Seoul. The palace is massive and although you cannot step into all the houses you can visit the museum to gather informational pamphlets and walk through to learn about the imperials throne, traditions and view their clothing, tools and even see the structure of how the formation of the dynasty. I would not recommend you to go if you are not into seeing old museums or looking for adventure."
3679,4.0,It is quite big and has a lot of things to see inside. there's also a museum there as well.  After you finish looking around there you can easily access buses or subways as well as many other attractions in the neighborhood.
3680,5.0,"second time visiting this palace, and it is still great. best place to learn the culture and history of korea. the place is really huge so prepare for a long walk! there is also museums to visit inside.  for more fun experience, you can rent those pretty hanbok and get inside for free, i believe. it was very cold when i visited though so i decided not to rent one"
3681,4.0,We made it to witness the guard changing ceremony at 10am. The palace is huge and we spent hours walking around. We managed to get discount as we were traveling in a group of 12 so it's Korean won 2400 per pax. Worth the money as we went in and took some beautiful pictures
3682,5.0,"The grounds here are large and beautiful. There were a lot of tourists groups but it did not feel crowded. There are amazing views and photo ops and it is just nice to spend the day outdoors in such a beautiful place. There was also a gift shop and cafe there. Stay for the traditional changing of the guard ceremony, it was nice and not too long.  There is a charge to get to the grounds and a separate charge to go inside the palace, we opted not to go into the palace, there was plenty to explore anyways."
3683,4.0,We went to this itinerary during winter. Some parts of the ground are very slippery. Several people slipped and fell.  We have someone to guide us through the palace. Great and meaningful history.  Must visit this historical palace and get a guide to explain the building structure and share it's history.
3684,5.0,My daughter and I decided to visit the palace. I am so glad we did. The palace is so beautiful and we spent about an hour and a half waking around. It was freezing cold and it was nice to be able to grab a coffee during the walk. We also stopped to have traditional tea. It is well worth the visit. And a cab fare is really cheap if you take an orange cab. The black cabs are more expensive.
3685,5.0,"in spite of the cold we visited the palace and walked around these beautiful grounds as much as possible. It's a must-see, especially if you should be lucky enough to see the changing of the palace guard. We weren't able to - cancelled due to the snow, however, they were standing at the front gate entrance. Very colorful and fierce looking guys who didn't mind having their photos taken. The palace was built in 1395 and was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty and destroyed by fire during the Imjin War (Japanese invasion - 1592-8) and abandoned for two centuries. Mount Bugak is the backdrop and if you want to have a lovely view of the entire grounds, walk over to the National Museum and take the elevator to the (? can't remember; might be the 8th floor or higher?) where there is a terrace that provides a marvelous view."
3686,5.0,"The palace is great culture, good for pictures, and offers free English tours. The place is huge, and near other attractions, so I recommend planning your day around it."
3687,4.0,"We went in November. A bit chilly out but no queues and less tourists. Well preserved old palace with traditional guards in Korean dress. Changing of the guard ceremony was beautiful. Earlier in the day was nice as we were largely alone. If it is rainy day I would not recommend as there is very little in the way of shelter. Even in winter, the gardens were beautiful! In a truly busy metropolis, this was 2 hours of less noise and a hold onto Korea's past which is not always evident with the rush to modernity!"
3688,5.0,"This was one of our very first stops upon arrival in South Korea. I would definitely suggest going in springtime, when the cherry blossoms are in bloom, and hopefully the lotus flowers in the pond are blooming too. You could easily spend half a day to a full day to see each and every piece of this area. We got some great photos, and definitely plan to head back again before our couple of years here are done!"
3689,5.0,Walking through Gyeongbokgung Palace was an amazing experience. All of the buildings are beautiful and full of rich history. Free tours run every few minutes in various languages. Our tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and kind!
3690,5.0,"being over 65 years old we were very surprised that we did not have to pay for the entrance fee as seniors. Place was very grand , very inteersting and worth seeing"
3691,5.0,"One of the best places for pictures! Lots of walking though and there's really only a few spectacular places. One is the pond in back the the small pagoda and the other is behind and to the left of the main throne room- it's a huge dinner hall in a rectangular pond. Find these and a few others and you're good. Otherwise it can get exhausting. Beautiful in winter, too."
3692,4.0,We were there the same date as the korean celebrate lunar new year hence the new year decoration. Had lots of fun taking photos and most importantly we got to wear on Korean traditional clothes for photo shooting and it was for free!
3693,5.0,"This is the second time here. A lot of tourists as usual, but well manicured. Quite big, takes an hour or two to walk the whole palace. Must see if you haven't already, but probably not more than once."
3694,5.0,We visited during winter. Beautiful palace. Definitely worth the visit! Better to wait to watch the change of palace guards.
3695,5.0,"I think i only explore 1/3 of the whole area as it was so cold during my visit. but the scenery that you can expect is beyond your imagination, i must say that this is one of the best place for you to visit. Great ancient architecture. Be there at 10am every morning to watch guard changing ceremony at the front yard. The palace closed on Tuesday. Admission fee is cheap, only KRW3000 per pax."
3696,5.0,"We were fortunate enough to be present for the changing of the guard ceremony (check times). It was very colorful, the horns sounded just like bagpipes!"
3697,5.0,"This beautiful palace with history that spirals back to 13th century is definitely to be included in your top 3 to do items in Seoul! Located convenienty by Gyeungbokgung metro station,it come conplete with free guided tours in many different languages.  Our English guide ,Ginny was very poised in her traditional costume and was never short in updating the group about the tiniest details of the Joseun dynasty from the smart palace architectures to its fate from invasion of Japanese occupation amongst other info...the view of the well preserved palace on the blue sunny winter day was breathtaking!  The palace was also located side by side to the National Folk Musuem that houses a lot of historicsl artifacts.The many traditional activity booths set up there due to the Lunar New Year celebration made the visit all the more an interesting learning experience"
3698,4.0,Very convenient to travel to Gyeongbokgung Palace. Is just outside a metro station.  Interesting palace to visit. Totally recommend for family who are bringing elderly. A slow stroll and a place to see their Korean palace culture.
3699,3.0,"It's large, impressive and historial. But a bit boring in the winter. Most of the courtyards are mud and wet after the snow. Very crowded with Chinese tour groups during the Chinese New Year holiday. Most of the buildings you don't enter and you just look in through the door or window. Might be more interesting with a tour group. Overall worth seeing if you have some time to fill since it's only 3k won for the general entry. But I wouldn't consider it a ""must see"""
3700,5.0,"Truly beautiful. Bit of a hike to get around and see everything there, but on a nice pleasant Seoul day well worth the extra steps. Interesting architecture and would recommend taking the time to just take a step back and take it in. A guide would be somewhat helpful, but a good tour guide book can be nearly as accommodating."
3701,3.0,"Had a short walk in the compounds before coming out as my aged father could not walk much. That said, the trees were barren and I think it would definitely be much nicer during spring and autumn. During winter, I felt that the buildings on its own could not muster the same majestic feel of European palaces could without the help of landscapes"
3702,4.0,the biggest palace in seoul..it's huge! the changing guard take place in the main gate before entrance..if wearing hanbok (korean traditional costume) got free admission
3703,5.0,A really large and absolutely beautiful especially during autumn. 2 hours won't be enough to go around and see everything. i suggest anyone to rent a hanbok then went here. too much beautiful place to take pictures
3704,4.0,This was our first palace on our first day in Seoul. We enjoyed the time at the palace and was pleasantly surprised with the free tour that was provided in English.
3705,5.0,"Even in the freezing cold you can appreciate the beauty. Everything had a crisp, frozen shine to it. We saw many couples in traditional dress taking wedding photos, and whole families dressed up for the lunar new year."
3706,5.0,"The Palace is a great photo stop, there is a museum in there and they are free pf charge. I saw some people walking around in Hanbok, so maybe you should be able to rent a Hanbok in the area for a full experience..."
3707,5.0,"i've been to this palace three times already, and don't get sick of it. it's beautiful, and it's worth to read a little bit about it before, so you can understand it better. highly recommended."
3708,3.0,"It's a decent place by itself. If you never seen an Asian palace then you should go. But if you had been to Kyoto, Thailand, or Beijing, then this becomes quite trivial. Don't let this palace be the reason to come to Seoul."
3709,5.0,In winter season this place looks more great... Cause is better for taking picture while you wear a traditional korean clothes.. It called hanbok. The background of the emperror are fantastic... And there is a place of museum
3710,5.0,This is the main palace for the King and Queen during the Joseon period. It was built in the 1300's and is meticulously maintained. The buildings are all exquisite and the history is fascinating. I recommend taking the walking tour.
3711,4.0,"Impressive palace, big place. I also visited the folk museum next door which was not all the interesing. It was Sunday and many women walked around in traditional folk costumes, a real sight."
3712,5.0,"Don't miss this attraction it is amazing and the people of Seoul are so warm and friendly, I loved it"
3713,5.0,An excellent job is being done to restore the palace complex to what it was like about 1890. It would be great if they could add a museum which explains the period of Korean history during which the palace was built and used.
3714,4.0,There had been events taking place earlier in the evening so didn't get to see the palace until quite late from the front gate. Very beautiful colourful and well worth a stop even if only briefly. Would love to come back during the day. Just beautiful to see with snow around it as we were lucky enough to. Quite a contrast to the city around it
3715,5.0,"Good to go with a tour guide ( its own staff). I had one speaks in Mandarin. She is very patient,and the tour was about 1 hr. She had inteoduced some background about each palace and what was happened to the original building. I won't get much information if i go by myself."
3716,5.0,Great place to see and understand the history of Seoul. Be sure to come for the changing of the guards to witness a cultural performance from days that've past. There are shops that let you rent cultural Korean clothes but it was a bit too cold so we passed on that. Easily accessible from the MRT.
3717,4.0,"If there is a royal residence one must visit in Seoul for history lovers, its got to be Gyeongbokgung. Great for picturesque photo shoot, buddhist themed devoration/structures against the backdrop of distant mountains and colourful changing of guards ceremony. One can snap photos with the palace guards; no touching. There is a small admission fee."
3718,5.0,"Nice cultural place in the middle of a modern city. But can have so many tourists at times. For added feels, wear a hanbok"
3719,4.0,Rich with information regarding Korean history. Very clean. Can be packed with tourists during prime hours. Overall a good experience.
3720,4.0,"This is the most popular palace by far. It's central location and the importance of its gate is very clear. The grounds are well-kept and vast. There are many interesting things to see here and even a museum inside (that's totally worth a visit), but I have to say that having visited all of the palaces in Seoul, this one is not the best in my opinion. I would advise visiting Changdeokgoong and getting a tour of the Secret Royal Gardens. It's a stunning place, and the quiet nature of the gardens is surprising. There is no city noise at all."
3721,4.0,One palace that you should not miss during your trip to seoul. A lot of walking as the palace area is quite huge but it is worth it.
3722,5.0,Beautiful place. There's a museum on the grounds too. Don't miss the ceremony of the change of guards. Impressive!
3723,4.0,I spent a morning with a group here. Great way to spend half a day exploring and learning. Cost was low and grounds were spectacular. A must see.
3724,5.0,"The palace "" compound "" is quite large... looks deceptively small from the outside but once inside is a treasure trove of history and beautiful architecture... a must see if visiting S Korea"
3725,5.0,This is so far the best Palace in Seoul as this is very big and there's a Korean National Museum inside which is free of charge. There are also palace guards demonstration and you can wear traditional Korean attire. This is also very near to many tourist spots which you can only walk to enjoy the city view along the way.
3726,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung palace is the largest palace in Seoul. Within its compound, you would find other museums too. There are guard changing ceremonies and English guided tours at various timings of the day. It would be wise to plan in advance. Do note that it's closed on Tuesdays. If you are planning to visit the secret garden at Changdeokgung Palace, you would be better off getting the combi ticket at 10,000 won and this valid for 1 month.  If you are visiting in January, make sure you have sufficient winter clothings as the palace tours can get fairly chilly at times.  Also, make sure you have a good breakfast too as you are likely to spend more than half a day here."
3727,4.0,One of the most popular tourist destination in South Korea. Highly recommended for first time visitors.
3728,5.0,We went to the palace and it was such an wonderfull day. I never thought that this place is so big! There is also a museum for free. Next time I will also go there!
3729,4.0,"If you're going to see one palace, choose this palace. Changing of the guards was nice, and they let you take pictures with the guards after (like London), and same rules apply, don't touch them. More than the changing of the Guards, what I liked more was just being able to roam around the palace and take many pictures on their grounds, it is so surreal, so many historical K-dramas floated through my mind. The trees on this property are so gorgeous, my eyes kept floating from the plants to the architectures and back. Once I visited this palace, I didn't feel the need to see any other. They also have a cute and very clean café to purchase snacks and drinks. My only regret was not knowing to rent a traditional hanbok (Korean dress), before going to this Palace. There were other tourist there that thought ahead, and went to places to rent a hanbok and headdress, and they looked really good taking pictures at the palace. I'm planning on visiting this place again, and this time I will rent a hanbok ;)"
3730,5.0,"Easy to get to using public transport and worth seeing while in Seoul! If you only have time to visit one palace, this is it."
3731,4.0,We walked around the palace. The palace is not huge but beautiful. Not much we can enjoy due to a limited time. Most of the time we use to take photos. We were lucky to come when the weather is sunny in the winter.
3732,3.0,I was expecting a rather huge Palace before I headed over to Korea but my group of 10 only stayed in the Palace for 1.5hr before we got really bored and left.  It's worth a visit but don't bother spending too much time there. Not much to see as compared to the different castles or palaces around the world.
3733,4.0,"I'm a fan of historic drama series and one in particular was set in this palace so it was exciting to visit the place and see it for myself. Beautifully maintained, with informative signage, it's a ""must see"" stop in Seoul."
3734,5.0,"Went here with my girlfriend and it was nice to see some historical architecture. The buildings have AC and the palace grounds are incredibly wide and long, will require 1 or 2 hours to see the entire place."
3735,3.0,This place is in downtown Seoul. Great place to see some Korean architecture and history. This place has guided tours in english and specific times . Please make sure to check these times.
3736,5.0,"I love strolling the compound with beautiful tree and flowers, well maintained and preserved palace. Surrounded by modern and tall building makes it special. A lot of walking but the landscape is very nice and picturesque. Rebuilt architecture but still a great place to visit. Beautiful maple and ginkgo tree in the compound. Love it!"
3737,4.0,It was interesting to visit the palace and get to know more about the history of korean. Recommended for families.
3738,4.0,"Reached just nice at a time they were having the change of guards ceremony.. huge place, wonderful architecture..."
3739,5.0,"It was very fun to visit the palace and I must say a must go for the trip to Korea. If you wanna experience wearing hanbok, there are some shops that rent out hanbok nearby but just make sure you do some comparison first as there are definitely gonna be some differences, regardless in terms of price or the hours of rental.  Furthermore, if you were to wear hanbok to enter the palace, you get a waiver of the entrance fee so it's a hit on 2 birds with 1 stone isn't it?  Enjoy your trip at gyeongbokgong palace as I did."
3740,5.0,"I haven't been to KyeongBok Palace during this trip but this is The Glimpse into the old palace of Korea representing how it was back in those days, rather last centuries and not that old. It's pretty but not as big as the Forbidden city in Beijing of course. Not much as left except for the building in both palaces of course but it's nice to have some remnants of old times."
3741,5.0,Beautiful palace peaceful very well presented Worth a visit we did not get to see all there were heaps to see
3742,4.0,"We ran into changing of the guards and it had narrations in 4 different languages so most travellers would be able to understand. Great buildings and architecture for understanding the history of Korean royalty. Just hope there were some guidebooks for us to follow. It was a bit boring because there wasn't enough guide of the purpose the the buildings. At the end, it ended up with quite a lot of similar buildings."
3743,4.0,"This area is very huge so I would suggest a pair of comfortable shoes when you visit this place. There is free wifi and tours. Also, one can dress up in traditional korean clothing while strolling inside the palace. Don't miss out on the change of guards ceremony in front of the palace gate (facing Gwanghamun Square)."
3744,5.0,"Recently featured in several UK tv documentaries which prompted the visit. An outstanding, quite large palace comprising a number of well maintained and beautifully decorated buildings. Time your visit to include the changing of the guard - a rare experience!"
3745,3.0,The photo spot at the corner angle view spot is the better point to aim your back ground photo shoot especially with mountain as a back drop  Just stand still... hahaha...  the history about this palace surely can mean something to any tourist if they feel related to the object..hard for me to tell more  Scenery enjoyment ... yeah you will get that...
3746,5.0,"A pretty well reserved place, beautiful! You can really get a pick of Korea's history here. Not much of an.exhibition inside the constructions but plenty of places to walk around and get amazing photos. Kind of hard during winter considering the amount of time spent outside."
3747,5.0,You will recognise many locations appearing in Korean dramas. A very beautiful place to take a slow and romantic walk. Alas I was with my young children. Seems that you get free entrance if you are wearing the hanbok which we didn't try. But seeing many people in hanbok set a very nice atmosphere. It is also in walking distance to the famous ginseng chicken restaurant so plan to visit before or after your lunch :)
3748,5.0,"Recommended to buy the Combination ticket that costs W10,000 and gives admission to 5 sites plus the Secret Garden. Advisable to look for the schedule for the guided tours and the changing of guards which are listed online for easier planning. This is easily the most crowded of all Palaces in Seoul. There are also 2 good museums onsite - the National Palace Museum and National Folklore Museum Museum. The Gwanghwamun, Bukchon Hanok Village are also around so this visit can easily take up the entire day. Nearby the excellent Tosokchon Samgyetang restaurant is a must visit for ginseng chicken soup."
3749,5.0,Make sure you go for the changing of the guards and also in time for the guided tours which are free and very informative. Lots of teenage couples walking around with traditional clothing and they don't mind having their pictures taken.
3750,4.0,"This is a notable Seoul attraction. As such, it gets huge lines. Plan accordingly. Have visited twice now."
3751,4.0,"A great place to wander as well as to look into Korean culture. A great place to just take your time.  Try to catch the changing of the guards.  Great for people who love taking photos. So many spots and things to capture.  Does require a bit of walking, though an easy walk."
3752,5.0,"Basically only myselg and mom (no other selection can be done). In this gigantic palace and also a main palace which later rebuilt in years, the Josean dynasty has been using other palaces as their main palace.  It was to my surprise of the beauty of the palace and a must visit museum to understand the entire historical era of S.Korea kings dynasty. Again, our private tour guide, Juno was like a walking history book explaining to me what was that all about.  You can see the water clock, the astrology of the olden days with truly brilliant creation and characters that they have used. The sun dial really beautiful and so do the map of the stars.  Gwanghwamun also together in this itin and fascinating by looking at it. The palace is so huge to be true with different set of furnitures, walk way, crafted stones and auspicious animals of ancient belief.  Don't forget to see the guards changing time and take a shot with them. That is cool!!  Well, check out yourself if you truly indulge into some olden cultures history frel like me besides K-pop! You can even drop by the nearer eating place to raste the beef soup rice to give you warm feeling in a cold winter! No regrets!"
3753,5.0,"We paid a small admission fee to enter the palace grounds. There were many beautiful buildings to look at. We had visited Changdeokgung Palace just prior to this one, and the buildings in both were somewhat similar."
3754,3.0,"A nice place to visit, small entry fee, but if you really want to learn something go to the Palace museum that are just inside the grounds. Good descriptions in English."
3755,5.0,"It was really beautiful and quiet. We went during the MERS scare, so it was very empty. The people working there were very friendly."
3756,4.0,Very Interesting worthwhile site to visit. No/minimal entrance fee. (Free during our trip) Accessible by subway. Not so crowded and wonderful photo opportunities.
3757,5.0,"Probably the grandest of the palaces in Seoul, I really enjoyed walking around the gardens and the peaceful scenery with the mountains in the background. Come early before the hoards of tour buses arrive!"
3758,5.0,Had a good understand on the palace layout during the Joseon dynasty. Met many Korean visitors wearing Hanbok and taking pictures with loved ones around this serene place. A must visit place if one wishes to get a glimpse into the glamour of Joseon dynasty and the life of the royal family as well as the government officials.
3759,5.0,"This palace has a lot of history about Korea and its kings' lives. The free guided tours (in English, Mandarin, and Japanese) are very informative and gives quite a lot of information about the past. Worth checking the change of guard that happens twice a day. Don't miss the free guided tour which lasts for about 1.5 hours."
3760,4.0,"This is the largest and arguably the most beautiful of the palaces in Seoul and a must see, with many splendid sights, including several national treasures and the originally conserved Gyeonghoeru Pavilion and Hyangwonjeong Pond. You'll want to reserve 2-3 hours to savour everything there is to see here."
3761,5.0,We got to hire humboks and we got in to this for free and walked around in costume while seeing this place. We got to see the changing of the guards display also.
3762,5.0,"We had visited the Palace and watched the Guard Changing Ceremony which happens daily here and is a must watch. They have a band and guards in colorful uniform carrying flags and marching towards the gate. Many people gather around to watch this ceremony. Once you enter the palace, there is the Main Entry, where you get best WIFI connection but do not waste your time sitting in there and move ahead, you will be surprised at how vast this palace is although it seems small from the outside. Also one can see the architecture, museum (inside premises), relax in the garden area and learn a lot about Korean culture and influence."
3763,4.0,"I guess a visit to a palace is a ""must"" for any visit to Seoul, unless you have zero interest in history or photography. If you only have time for 1, make Gyeongbokgung the place to go. Coming here is pretty easy via the Metro (at the very imaginative ""Gyeongbokgung station""). Once you exit the station, there are numerous signs to tell you where to go, and you come out at the National Palace Museum. It is easy to spend an entire day here esp. if you visit both museums (the other is the Folk Museum), wait for the guard-changing ceremony, plus taking pictures of the palaces."
3764,5.0,"If you are into historic place, this is a must go and we had the chance to see the change of the palace guards but my kids were a little scared of the fierce looking guards though they were just standing and everyone was taking turns to take photos with them. It was Cultural Day when visited so it was free entry. Plenty of young ladies and gentlemen dressed in Korean traditional costumes in the cold winter. Some of the area in the palace was covered with snow. Very pristine. A short walk a way from the palace was the National Palace Museum and then across the Museum was the area for Bukchon Hanok. A must go for tourists. The Palace grounds wasn't very stroller friendly as the steps was not even but they had ramp everywhere that had stairs to ease the way for those with strollers and wheelchairs."
3765,3.0,It's a nice palace with Korean architecture. We can go around the outer part of the building - not the inside one.  Please go inside the National Forklore Museum to learn about the culture. Worth knowing. * TK
3766,5.0,"It is a typical beautiful,well conserved palace in Seoul and you can see the change of guards outside!"
3767,1.0,This place is not worth a visit. I have visited many palaces around the world and this is really a minimalist palace. Can skip.
3768,5.0,"This is such a beautiful place! We went in early october at night when there was a light show as well, many people dressed up in traditional outfits (which can be rented in the surrounding town area). Very grand, clean, and very worth the visit."
3769,4.0,"It is our second time visiting the palace, and this time the feeling is different, which educated us to use a simple and humble angle to appreciate how the ancient Korean Royal families were also very humble and not excessive, and appeared in matching role and status."
3770,3.0,"Easy to get there via subway. However, it's a long walk for old people who cannot walk fast and long especially during the winter and windy days. Muzeum is informative. The restaurant serves good food and prices are reasonable compared to those outside. Should provide English speaking staff to explain things to visitors though. The change of guard is nothing much and not worth waiting for. Go during last Wednesday of the month and you get free entrance."
3771,5.0,"they have the guided tours a couple of times a day, some in chinese and mostly in english. the lady guide we had was informative and courteous. other than seeing all the interesting structures there, one could wander just a bit to the presidential palace next door for a photo."
3772,4.0,The palace ground was immense so be prepared to walk for an hour or more. There are a lot of people wearing hanbok so it was quite a sight. It was like being time warped to the earlier days of Seoul. Be sure to catch the changing of the palace guards. We were here last autumn and the trees were colorful and dramatic. Perfect place to practice your photography skills and do pictorials.
3773,4.0,"This palace just keeps on giving.  After nearly every gate, there was another amazing gate. Behind which was another beautiful and ornate structure. The architecture and design of the grounds gives you an insight into the power that was concentrated here.  A word of advice. In the winter, be prepared. There is no heated building in the palace. We arrived early in the morning and froze our toes. Our only saving grace was the nearby and semi attached museum at the back of the palace grounds.  In fact, even though the entrance fee for the palace was minimal at roughly 3$, I found it odd that if entering from the back side palace entrance to go to the museum, you can essentially enter both the museum and the palace for free.  The museum was amazing, but i will review it on its own."
3774,4.0,"This is a huge place so be prepared for a lot of walking. There are some buildings that have some furniture but most are empty. There are informative signs which are helpful and they are in English. This is where they have a very colorful changing of the guards.. if you don't get the pictures you want, they will stand out in front of the palace so you can get your picture taken with them. There is a small building where you can try on their outfits and heve your picture taken. Thereare beautiful grounds with a lake. bring a picinic."
3775,5.0,"While there are three other palaces in Seoul, I don't think you can go wrong with this one. Like almost everything historical in Korea, it's been reconstructed after being destroyed during the Japanese colonial period. The job has been done well, though. Walking through the huge park is wonderful, and a stop for traditional treats is worth the extra 10,000 won, especially considering the cheap price of admission. Throw in the free folk museum, which is big enough itself to spend a few hours, and the whole complex is one not to miss while in Seoul."
3776,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung is a beautiful tourist spot where you can learn more about Korea. Aside from that, it's a nice place for a walk because it's a huuuugggeee place.  Good thing about it is it's also walking distance Changdeokgung Palace, Bukchon Hanok Village, and the famous monuments.  You can also watch the guard changing ceremonies (if you find it interesting)"
3777,5.0,"If you have a short time visiting South Korea, you don't have to go to every palace in Seoul but just go here. You can already experience the vibe of Joseon Dynasty by going to Gyeongbokgung. If you don't want to pay the entrance fee, try wearing hanbok and take pictures like the old days! It's a good place during autumn when most of the trees turn brown, red and yellow."
3778,4.0,A palace not that different from the forbidden city in Bejing! Entry is about 3 dollars and it's definetly worth a visit!  Make sure to take to the left after the palace and then walk straight up by the little pond to have a great view of the national folklore museum.
3779,3.0,Everything is ok with this palace. The only truth is all buildings are max 50 years old. Here is no historical or authentic brick at all. Guard changing is intresting to watch.
3780,4.0,I like the place. Our host brought us to this place to experience Korean culture and history. It's clean and enjoyable. I've learned a lot about their culture. Great experience.👍
3781,5.0,"Can't complete your must-see list if you don't see the Changing of the Guards. It's like a parade of colors. I loved the outfits and the movements. It's outdoor and it lasts for less than 10 minutes, so don't be late. The whole place is grand and abounds with history and culture. Roam at leisure. Tickets are for going inside towards palace and not necessary for watching the Changing, but it's for a minimal fee and worth going around. Quite accesible by train because station is near. You can plan to walk to Bukchon Village to complete your itinerary."
3782,4.0,Remember to spare some time here as this place is big and pretty time consuming to visit. This is a must see place to all the tourists. The view and atmosphere there was pretty nice. They are lots of girls that dress up with hangbok. It's a very nice place to take pictures and for long walking. Remember to catch the changing of guard at Gwanghwamun.
3783,3.0,"In this place you can see the biggest castle or south korea and its history, you cAn rent a traditional costume too"
3784,5.0,"A humungous palace with lots of walking to do and much to learn on. So allow yourself at least half a day to take your time to go through this whole complex. It's a paid entry. If you want a free entry, you may go to the museum that is to the side of this palace. To get to see imperial Korean history, this is the place to be if you have limited time in Seoul. Other palaces are typically similar to this one. It's usually filled with tourists, especially in warmer months, so expect to have other people in your photos of the scenery and selfies."
3785,4.0,"The palace is spread over a huge area. It's really nice to have a stroll around and explore the different part. The only thing is, after a while everything starts looking the same, especially if you have visited other palaces and temples in Korea. You will see the same motifs and architecture everywhere."
3786,4.0,If you love culture and history I'm recommend this place for you since there are many places near it you will need a full day to visit them.
3787,4.0,"We came on a day which was free admission. The grounds are really serene with a bridge over a large pond with lily pads. We saw a many in hanboks from school kids visiting on field trips to tourists renting there's nearby. This was the first palace we visited and it was the better of the 3 in Seoul. The trees were turning already and looked very nice with the building and pond areas. It was a cool, overcast day. We spent only 1hr total here. This is because the buildings are completely empty. This one was rebuilt after being burned down completely by the Japanese. There are no furnishings, items from daily life, or anything you'd see in European palaces or even American grand estates in any of the palaces in Seoul, so it is disappointing in that respect. Maybe all these antiquities are hidden away in museums instead because in we didn't see any of it here or at the other 2."
3788,4.0,"It is near to several train stations so it won't be hard to visit. They are closed during Tuesdays. But you may opt to go to the National Museum instead, try renting a hanbok too, for the ultimate experience"
3789,4.0,"We went here as one of the last few stops before our flight back that evening. Lovely sights and buildings, very peaceful too. Got the chance to witness the changing of guards ceremony. The guards are kind of the korean version of the London Royal Guard, you can take pictures with them (in their very elaborate garments), but they never smile lol. The ceremony was definitely worth watching! I'm unsure of other schedules, but the one we witnessed was at 11am, so make sure to do some research if you'd like to watch the ceremony!"
3790,4.0,"Bright colors and details with the mountains and city in the background made this place pretty breathtaking. I was only able to go for a short time while on a layover, I'll definitely return to see the guards."
3791,5.0,The narratives in the palace give you an idea of history of conflict between Japan and Korea .... in particular Japan's aggression.
3792,4.0,"One of the palace to see in Seoul. The grounds are huge and eye opening to the structure of the palace in the ancient days. Seeing in person is ""wow"" as compared to watching in TV drama. I can imagine how one need to walk from one end of the palace to another to talk to someone."
3793,5.0,"This was the first stop during our half-day guided tour in Seoul. We spent just under an hour touring the castle and grounds. I'm glad we had a guide, because I feel we learned much more about the cite. There are two good clean restrooms, plenty english plaques, and many photo spots. We went in December, which was still beautiful, but seeing this in Spring or Summer with the gardens in bloom would have been even better."
3794,5.0,"If you go to one place in Seoul, go here. Beautiful buildings to see and lots of walking in the gates."
3795,4.0,"First visited in the 90s and the experience has much improved since then.  The colorful, authentic replication of the post classical history guards and their ceremonies are a must see. And the idea of being able to wear traditional Korean garb while visiting adds a nice extra touch.  The opening of more exhibits in other parts of the castle depicting more accurate representations of life back then would enhance the experience more."
3796,5.0,"The palace has plenty of things to see (we eneded up going back later in the week). Try one of the tours there, they are full of information. My family thought some of my photos of the palace were postcards, they were so pretty."
3797,3.0,"Nothing special about this palace as a lot of the places got "" Do not enter"" signs on it. But if you like looking at how the king used to live then go visit the place."
3798,3.0,"The palaces inside all look very similar. And once you go up the steps, you can only look from the outside. I enjoy some of the history but was not interested enough to stay for long. The grounds would be very difficult for strollers to maneuver."
3799,3.0,"We missed the free guided tour so I think it wasn't as engaging by walking on our own. In comparison with the palaces in China, this wasn't as good. It could do with more explanatory notes/signages for tourists to read about the history / culture. The souvenir shop had really lovely items though. We managed to catch the changing of guards which were interesting."
3800,4.0,"A very nice place to visit either solo, as a couple or with friends. Easily accessible through the subway and they have free tours with guides in three languages including English. My guide was very friendly and had a good sense of humour. I recommend to visit this place at least once if you visit Seoul"
3801,4.0,"Excellent site. It only cost about 6 dollars to enter the palace grounds. I was surprised how large the attraction was. We only had a couple of hours to tour the palace, so we had to rush through it. It includes a museum that has a lot of history to cover. Access is easy either via cab or metro. We use a cab and it was inexpensive."
3802,5.0,"Visited the palace with a friend and it is a pleasant stroll with a lot to see. I've been before, and frankly it's better to go in the spring or summer when the flowers are blooming, but it's still worthwhile in the less colorful weather. Lots of people dressed in traditional clothes - you get a discount if you dress in hanbok. Changing of the guard is quite a nice thing to see. (My friend from Korea tells me that the guards are actually young men doing their military service, so they are in fact REAL guards).  The gift shop is lovely also.  The palace is right near a number of other tourist attractions and well worth spending a few hours to see how the royalty of years ago lived."
3803,5.0,"This is a place to visit if you want a peek into Korean history. The stories about the Kings, and their way of living is intriguing. Make sure you get the audio guide it is only 3000won and give great context to your visit."
3804,2.0,A large area need to cover. Quite interesting and beautiful buildings. Only if miss out tge guided tour one won't be able to understand the details of the history. But if follow the guided tour will miss out the Royal Guards Changing Ceremony. Means need to stay in the Palace longer .
3805,4.0,Surrounded by the bustling city of Seoul is this wonderfully maintained priceless cultural gem. Take your time to marvel at the architecture and the amazing artwork on the roofs and ceilings. Well worth a stop.
3806,5.0,Visited the palace with the free shuttle from Hotel Ibis.  The palace is grand and huge. It was rebuild and it is still in the process of rebuilding as it was destroy during the war. I took the free guided tour and it gives us a good history lesson.  A good place to visit for at least 4 hours and there is also the changing of guards that you should not miss.  A must visit place while you are in Seoul.
3807,5.0,"From our hotel its just a 20min subway ride, however we have to change to a different line to reach it. The best is to get the guards changing duty time in advance in order to catch it first hand.  It is more of a growth up place, kid really feel bore in this."
3808,3.0,"Many of my friends been to South Korea and Gyeongbokgung Palace and didn't know that they have Change of Guard. Our private tour guide parked the car right under the palace and we walked up, and ta-da, right inside the palace, and we didn't waste any time waiting, and saw the change of guard ceremony. It is a nice palace, and look like the Forbidden Palace in Beijing in many aspects. Saw it in tour info that if you wear the traditional hanbok, you can enter this place for free, plus few other places in Seoul. We went in July and its too hot to wear hanbok, so not sure if its true."
3809,5.0,It is indeed a Must See when in Seoul! The guards changing ceremony is an event to watch by itself! The palace is tremendously huge & majestic! U can spend half a day there & be mesmerized by the scenic view of the palace! Gem of Korea!
3810,5.0,"This palace was gorgeous! The colours were amazing, unlike any other palace I have visited. It's very big, so you don't feel too crowded with people! Involves a lot of walking because it's so big. Definitely a must see in Seoul!"
3811,4.0,"We sign up the free tour guide to tour the palace. You can sign up thru their visit Seoul website.. it needs a local Seoul contact number in order to do the booking, just choose the language tour that you prefer. The is the largest palace in Seoul. You will need a good 1.5 hours there to really going thru all the attraction in there. There are a few tourist attraction nearby the palace, do plan to spend half a day for this area."
3812,5.0,"A fantastic Korean heritage place to visit, make you back to ancient and feel the King life. Korean good in maintained and keep that all history to future."
3813,3.0,"If you are into history, architecture and learning more of the culture of the previous centuries then this visit to the palace is well worth the time spent. If you are not into history, architecture and learning more of the culture of the previous centuries then if you seen one palace, you have seen this palace already since they all are pretty much alike to me during this period in history and in this geographic area. It is huge and you will get your exercise walking the grounds."
3814,5.0,"After a no show of tour guide which I signed up for half day tour, I decided to go on my own. It is easy to find and the palace provides English speaking tour guide at 3 intervals. She is funny, dramatic and yet very professional. Excellent stories which made this visit very interesting. After the guided tour, you may walk around the palace but two hours should be sufficient as it is rather cold now. Tip: Suggest you stop at the information station to get a map and more info on places to visit at the right hand side at the entrance."
3815,5.0,"There's a lot of visitor wearing hanbok, which is amazing. You should definetely use hanbok too, there's a lot of places where you can rent the hanbok near anguk station or insadong. They're wearing the hanbok to gyeongbokgung and bukchon hanok village, since the location are kind of near and you can reach one another just by walking."
3816,5.0,Very beautiful place with many place to take very nice photos.You can go across the street to rent the Hanbok.
3817,5.0,"Its a huge palace, right in the middle of the city, made in traditional Korean style. Go early in the day to witness the changing of guards, at 11 am. There is also the museum and presidential palace (blue palace) behind it."
3818,5.0,"If you visit Seoul, you must see this place because it's very central, and it's also very famous. You'll see a lot of Koreans wearing their traditional clothes there, which is very cute. The street that faces/goes to the palace is very wide and beautiful. There are some statues there in the middle so you'll know it when you see it. Highly recommended."
3819,4.0,Toured this palace and was awed with the architecture. The palace complex was huge. There were also 3 museums nearby which were very informative. I especially enjoyed the Folk Museum. Also enjoyed the changing of the guards ceremony which was intricate and colorful.
3820,4.0,"Din expect it would be so big and din catered sufficient time to cover the whole area. In a way, wasn't with the right crowd as well since I was the only one who watched Kdrama and enjoy scenic walks. Peaceful and pleasant place to have a stroll.  Would recommend to at least visit it once when in Korea"
3821,5.0,"Loved it. Go early to avoid tourist crowd - and also if you want to take photos of the palace buildings without the crowds. There are two museums - National Folk Museum which is a very good introduction to how Koreans used to live up till now (cultures, beliefs, way of life). There's also the National Palace of Museum too.  I opted for MMCA or MOCA which is on the right side of the palace (if u r facing the entrance) - there's a cluster of private galleries too; Hyundai is worth a visit. If you walk further in, there's where the Bukchon Hanok village is located.  On the left of the palace is where all the cafes, eateries and hanbok rentals are. The infamous Tosokchon is there too. Ganghwamun Square is located directly in front of the entrance of the palace too (after the main road).  Just alight at Gyeongbokgung palace and there are clear directions leading you directly to the entrance."
3822,4.0,Enjoyed walking around the grounds to this beautiful large palace.Of particular interest was the Folklore museum right next door.
3823,5.0,I visited this Palace on my layover stay and i am glad i took up a transit tour package and got the opportunity to witness this magnificent Palace with so much rich history. It's very beautiful and i recommend everyone to visit.
3824,4.0,"I visited three palaces during my visit and enjoyed this one the most. It is a huge complex and takes time. The Changing of the Guard is a must see--I think they do it at 11 and 2 pm--but check before making plans. If you have been to the large palaces in China, this will seem familiar but still worth it. Cost is only 3000 won--so under $3 US."
3825,4.0,"As this palace was destroyed by Japanese troops in the late 1500's and as it has been redone in the 1800's and as then the builders changed it to look like a chinese palace, we do not really know how it was originally. Anyway the colours are more peaceful than in China and Japan and the motives of the ceiling designs are very beautiful. Worth visiting."
3826,5.0,Definitely a must see palace . Changing guards ceremony is interesting. Beautiful architecture building. Important chapter of Korean history.Beautiful cherry blossoms in Spring Apr16.
3827,5.0,"You can combine folk museum, insadong, bukchon, seoul contemporary art museum with gyeongbokgung.  Perfect place to chk the architecture of korean last dynasty Chosun. Perfect place to take walk with children or friend or date even.  My favorite spot in Seoul"
3828,5.0,"Luckily, I and my friends visited Gyeongbokgung Palace while the Royal Guard Changing Ceremony was performed. We find traditional and contemporary atmosphere in the palace. I think this is the most beautiful palace among others palace in Seoul."
3829,5.0,"Took a taxi to outside the gate and purchased admission ticket. Once inside the gate, we explored inside the walls and saw some amazing structures. We saw some signage with a brief English version explaining the structures. Wandering throughout, the sight has a folklore museum and temple and alongside a simulated village constructed to show life several centuries back. Also found ancient artifacts of sculptures used in early religious beliefs and practices. This was worth the admission and few hours spent wandering the grounds"
3830,5.0,"There's a lot of places to explore in this palace. I love the Hyangwonjeong area, the pond is like what you see in a painting but real. You can also witness the changing of the royal guards. Being here is a nice way to be familiar of their history.  This palace is accessible from the train station."
3831,5.0,I went there with my husband. it took us 3 hours to walk not even half of the palace. It is HUGE. And it is covered with ginkgo tree which their leaves has all turned into red and yellow. VERY BEAUTIFUL.
3832,3.0,"I was a bit disappointed by the palace as it is a rebuilt palace with almost no interiors. The imperial palaces in Japan or China are much bigger, nicer and more interesting.  It is still worthwhile to visit, but do not expect too much. I like the museum next to the palace though and would recommend to visit that one too when you already there."
3833,4.0,We joined the free English tour guided programme which was insightful. There were Mandarin guided tours too It closes on Tuesday.
3834,4.0,It is huge and located in the heart of Seoul so that it makes the city more attractive and interesting. Hyundai National Gallery and Samchungdong are very close to the site. Try this area.
3835,3.0,"It is not my favorite place, but it is so nice to see when the leaves are about to fall. Colors are awesome. People also enjoy it in spring, with the colorful flowers. I have a couple of times, and I always think that the most beautiful part is when I see it from the outside, the main entrance with the mountains behind."
3836,5.0,"A lovely historic site to visit; easy ride on the Metro and you are there to stroll and imagine what life was like for those who lived in and worked at the palace. The area near the back with the pond and pavilions is particularly beautiful and restful.  It is a bit surreal as skyscrapers surround this human sized place, but that makes it feel locked in time and very special. The museum has a quiet place to enjoy some tea either before or after you see the collection but for my money, the fun is wandering around the palace complex outside. Great place for families because kids can run."
3837,5.0,"If you have the opportunity to travel to South Korea you need to visit gyeongbokgung palace, you don't disappoint"
3838,5.0,"We travelled as a family of 4 with 2 children (aged 7 and 9) in the month of November 2016. We planned our visit to Gyeongbokgung around the timing of the free guided tours as we wanted to get a better understanding of the palace. The schedule for the tours can be found on the Visit Korea website. According to the website, you do not need to make advance reservation unless you are in a group with more than 10 people.  Eventually, we joined the 4pm Chinese language tour (last tour of the day; main gate closes at 4pm when we were there). The tour lasted 40 minutes and as we were the only family in the group, we could ask the guide many questions, which she patiently explained. We learnt a lot during the tour, including the significance of the animal statues surrounding the main hall, why there are wooden bars at the front doors of some buildings; how the heating system worked, why the emperor created the hangul language etc. Totally recommend joining the tour to get the most out of the Gyeongbokgung visit."
3839,3.0,"This palace was huge but it didnt really awe me. It was beautiful and we thought we would purchase the whole package of 3 places for like 10bucks. We ended up not even going to the other 2 because this one wasnt all that. I did not regret checking it out because thats what traveling is all about but i did regret purchasing the bundle since we didnt go to any other palaces. If you are trying to save money i would opt out of purchasing tickets. They let u into the entrance where the guards are for free so i would do a photo opt there and go spend ur money eating some tasty foods instead. But if you have money, go check it out."
3840,4.0,"Very nice place, entrance is only 2,5 euro including a free english tour lasting over a hour. The place is huge and for sure worth the visit. The gardens are very nice. The area around as well us interesting, and watch the change of the guards which is actualy in front and outside of the palace ground."
3841,4.0,"Understood from the guide that this place was burnt down twice in the past, left 30% for people to see. With the guide's explanation, could understand the architectural and historical part"
3842,4.0,"visited the place during early november 2016  happened to see the changing parade of ancient guards ceremony at the main entrance. according to online article, you will see it happening at every 11am, 12pm, 1pm, 2pm, 3pm..  after which, they will stand stationary at the gate facing the main road for a short while and this is the best time to take a photo with them! after i took a picture with them, suddenly a command was shouted and they left! the whole process for photo taking with them was less than 2 minutes! so fast! everyone was surprised that they left so fast, not sure if this is the norm..  visiting the palace during autumn period was great.. the trees are changing colours and there were many people wearing the traditional korean outfit taking OOTD near the maple trees, the view was marvelous  the palace was huge.. we were there for 1hr plus and have yet to complete the entire area. so do allocate some time to comb the entire place"
3843,3.0,"Super easy to get there, just take subway and get off at Gyeong bok gung station. Entry fee is 3,000w per person, price is quite reasonable and they provide free touring as well.  Went there in late Nov and it was freezing, and therefore we couldn't stay there for long, only went there for around 1.5 hours and we have missed a lot of nice places inside the palace. I would suggest to go in spring or summer time, because it opens for longer hours and provide night visiting with all the lighting at night time, for sure it will look more beautiful than visiting during winter with all the fallen leaves."
3844,4.0,"So I really enjoyed this historical site as it was extremely well preserved and great efforts have been put forth to ensure that the authenticity of as much of the past was preserved as possible. Some may disagree, but lest they forget, much has happened in the last hundred plus years in Korea that in some countries would not have allowed for such a rich piece of history to be put on display or refurbished good enough to make it a tourist must see spot. Having been to quite a few different historical sites in Korea, this is in my opinion one of the best ones to visit if you are into history. The only negative thing I would say is that this may not necessarily be a fun and action packed location that would inspire too much excitement from younger kids."
3845,4.0,"You can go to the Gyeongbokgung station and ascend directly yo the gate of the site. It's a massive complex and quite good to explore. People always flock at the center gates but there'd be lots of space to take nice photos inside the complex and garden. We visited during winter and very manageable number of visitors. The photos are a bit foggy though and while we get to have a glimpse of the mountain backdrop, I can only imagine how beautiful it is during summer or spring."
3846,5.0,We went there during autumn and it was a very lovely place with a lot of areas that are picture perfect. We went there twice because we felt during our first visit that it's a must to experience wearing Hanbok and so we did during our 2nd visit! Our pictures were great!
3847,4.0,"Much larger than expected, the grounds are huge. There isn't much to do except walk around and imagine what life must've been like centuries ago at the palace"
3848,4.0,"No visit to Seoul is complete without a trip to the Gyeongbokgung Palace. If you have time to visit only one palace, make it this one.  Start trip with a picturesque stop at the Gwanghwamun with the traditional guards and move on the massive palace grounds, soaking in the ancient Korean architecture and have a feel of what it was like during the Joseon Dynasty."
3849,5.0,Being here brought back so many memories of K-dramas. Loved it. My wife and I had this palace as one 1 hour stop of a city tour. This was definitely too short as we were rushed through by our tour guide in order to get to our next location. Definitely will be going back for a slower pace tour offered by the palace in English. Would not recommend self tour as you would miss out on the rich history. Comfortable shoes are a must.
3850,5.0,This is a must see. Check with locals or the concierge for days when they are having events in the park. Bring a good camera.
3851,4.0,Such a really large largeeee place to walk... But really a great place to understanding korea history.....
3852,4.0,"Finally, a beautiful and serene place in Seoul! Beautiful grounds, well worth your time. We came early in the morning a cold November day, and had some areas completely to ourselves, but I would guess it is crowded in the high season."
3853,5.0,"Out of the many palaces in Seoul, this is the one you must visit! As this place is huge, I recommend setting aside more time to spend here. Do catch the Royal Guard Changing Ceremony (10am-3pm) every hour at Gwanghwamun Square and join a free guided tour as it makes the whole place comes alive."
3854,4.0,"I came here and i got lucky i was in time for one of their marching of the guard routine. Really cool to witness so make sure you stick around for that. Also the placae itself is huge and so much to see, can spend like hours here. Worth visiting if you're in Seoul"
3855,4.0,"Being on a business trip, I managed to get a one day quick tour of Seoul. Through viator, I managed to visit this beautiful palace. As you pass through the various sections, you get closer to the main palace and to the old banqueting area. It gives you a real touch of Korea and if you visit the adjacent museum, there is a very good pictorial display of the Korea s history."
3856,5.0,"A must see in Seoul, beautiful, typical Korean architecture - wood and ceramic, brightly painted and immaculately clean. I understand that the palace has been completely rebuilt within the last 50 years after it was razed to the ground during an occupation. The tour guides speak an excellent level of English; if you enter at the main entrance, and exit at the back you can see the Blue House past its gates and guards (home of the president)."
3857,5.0,Fascinating to see the royal guard parade. Close to myeongdong but with a lot of activities to do...
3858,5.0,"One of the must place to come while you in South korea. When Autumn season the scenery very beautiful and the leaves color is yellow and red. The atmosphere of traditional and modern that mixed into one. The park very spacious, suitable as a place to sit relax and take pictures there. When I get there, I use hanbok and many foreign tourists request to take photos. Free entry ticket if you use hanbok."
3859,3.0,"... But not as much as Changdeokgung Palace. So if you only have time for one, pick the smaller, more intricate Unesco World Heritage Site."
3860,3.0,"Beautiful and so well maintained. Not only for the Palace, but also for the museums you can visit there. It is a complete visit to know more about Korea and Koreans. A must see."
3861,3.0,"It's a freezing cold day. Made it just in time to join the 11am English-speaking guide. Why does the tour always clash with the changing of Guards? Grrrrrr.  I suspect this palace will be prettier during other Seasons. It looks pretty dried up in winter.  The guide's stories were good but it's just too cold today........when she pointed out the National Folk Museum of Korea at the east gate, that was a Super informative museum.  Overall, the Korean architecture of this palace is interesting !!"
3862,4.0,"The palace was a very photogenic place in the Fall, with lots of colorful leaves. It was interesting, and a nice place to stroll and enjoy the trees in the foreground and modern city rising above."
3863,5.0,"Before going, check the time for the change of the guard (in period costumes). Get off at Anguk Stn. Entrance fee is cheap. Watching all the buildings can take easily several hours. This is the largest palaces. Only the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion remains as original. All the rest has been reconstructed 100 to 150 years ago. There are two museums at the back. The National Palace Museum is the place to go. The National Folk Museum is unimpressive. There is also an area that reconstructs a village about 50 years ago."
3864,4.0,"The Museum is a must see attraction if you are visiting Seoul, South Korea. The Museum is one of the oldest palaces that remains in the country."
3865,5.0,The site is close to Anguk metro station and has several courtyards and temples/palaces. Just keep walking north through each courtyard until one gets to the Royal Palace to see the King's throne. Your 3000 won ticket also gives you access to see the temple across the road to the right at the end of the palace and there is a free cultural museum there too. Takes half a day to see all.
3866,3.0,"Coming here during the summer is definitely a harsh time, as the ground of the palace is mostly soil/sand, and it would be terribly hot, should a sudden shower comes, there are not much places to go to. Night tour would be nicer I think, with all lit up."
3867,5.0,"This is the biggest palace out of the 5 palaces in Seoul. I went in November & the changing of the guard took place at 10am, not sure if changes so make sure to change. It was definitely worth watching. The palace is quite big but you can walk through the whole palace within 1-1.5hour. You get free entrance to the museum with your ticket but I didn't spend any time there because I was part of a tour."
3868,5.0,This is not that palace that comes to your mind when you think of any palace. This is a wide spread area with center located prayer hall and small rooms around the area. Entrace and buildings inside are of typical Korean construction in their early stages. You may feel relaxed as if you were in Korea before 70 to 100 years
3869,4.0,Nice view especially during Autumn. Nice weather. You can get in free when you are wearing korena traditional wear - Hanbook.
3870,3.0,The palace grounds are huge and expansive - the sheer size of the atrium will surprise you - but the palace in itself lacks luster and nothing magnificent.
3871,5.0,Beautiful royal castle and residence. Wonderful park grounds with lots to see and plenty of room for leisurely walks. Love it!
3872,3.0,"An extensive ground with many beautiful buildings and scenes. Spent 1-2 hours here walking around and taking photos. Perfect for a sunny day. The palace is closed on Tuesday's, and there's also free entry for those wearing traditional dress"
3873,4.0,"The Palace showcases the extravagance of the monarchy in their time. It is a showcase of culture, fauna and architecture etc. if one wishes to learn Korean history etc. It is best to join an English tour guide who has knowledge of its history and significance. Try to catch the changing of guards ritual at 10:00 a.m. and then tour the palace. There is an entrance fee ... but if you are a US military personnel, this is one of the choices offered in a package."
3874,5.0,Great palace to visit to experience a bit of korean history. It is definitely a main tourist attraction that is worth the time to visit. Guard changing at 10am and another one in the afternoon.
3875,5.0,We were able to take a tour which was extremely informative. The guide was well educated about the grounds and history of the site. We also took the secret garden tour
3876,4.0,The grounds and buildings of the palace are interesting but not spectacular. What is quite exceptional is changing of the guard at the main gate that was the highlight. A surprise that it was very reminiscent of the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace and other places in Europe. Colourful and apparently historic according to our guide. It was very crowded so arrive early for a front row view. It is very close to a subway stop so should be very to access if you are staying close to the transit system.
3877,5.0,We came here on the first day of our trip and what a beautiful place to start. This place is huge and there is lots to look around and see. The entrance price is more then reasonable. Just be warned if you leave through a certain gate you'll have to pay to get back in.
3878,5.0,What a fun time. The grounds are lovely and there is a lot going on. The leaves were changing and so the fall colors were super pretty. There was a changing of the guards sort of ceremony and that was really fun to watch. There were lots of folks in their traditional dress and we just had a lovely time. There is also a really great shopping area nearby and that was nice too. I am not sure what the shopping area was called.
3879,3.0,"This is interesting, but nothing too out of the ordinary. The changing of the guard was the highlight of the visit."
3880,5.0,"The temples have been renovated . Allow yourself sufficient time to visit this site, there is a lot to see."
3881,5.0,"I was lucky because I got to see the changing guard ceremony when I was there. Two times this palace got destroyed by fire but now it stood so majestic in the northern part of Seoul. The palace itself represents traditional culture mixture with contemporary architecture. The palace has a huge compound with beautiful scenery that allows visitors to take endless photos especially if you are wearing hanbok. Inside the compound there are two museums, too bad I didnt get the chance to visit it."
3882,5.0,Beautiful traditional palace in the nature. The tickets are reasonable and there is a free guide that takes you all around telling you abouy history.
3883,5.0,"This was the main royal palace of Joseon dynasty. The first one was build more than six centuries ago, but was then destroyed and rebuilt a few times. The last one has been in the past century and is now meticulously rebuilt following the original project. The whole area offers several buildings to visit including huge gates, palaces, small and bigger buildings. Expect to spend at least a couple of hours to visit this area. This was the most beautiful tourist site that we visited in Seoul."
3884,3.0,"The palace is huge so just keep in mind that you will have to walk the whole palace. We watched the changing of the guards, took pictures with the guards outside. If you're going in the summer, dress comfortable because is was too darn hot! Not much shade unless you're near the palace and the other buildings. There is so much history there which was very interesting. Beautiful palace, a must see if you're a first timer."
3885,5.0,"The most famous palace in Seoul. Entrance fee is 3000 won. Combi tickets is 10,000won altogether. Free entree for those who are wearing Hanbok. There's free guided tour around the palace at certain timing. Visitors should check the schedule for changing of guards ceremony before going to this palace."
3886,4.0,"When I planed to go Seoul, South Korea, the one itinerary must put in my schedule that was Gyeongbokgung Palace. I had visited Seoul fifth times, but I had also went with different people in these fifth times which meaned I visited Gyeongbokgung Palace fifth times. It was because that I would like to explain my experience to them such as the feeling which was comfortable to me walk into Gyeongbokgung Palace and I wanted to share with them. In the recent time of I visited Seoul that was on June 2016 with my friend. As I said, I wanted to bring her to Gyeongbokgung Palace, she wasn't understand why we will go an old and non-shopping viewpoint. But she finally accepted this itinerary. On that day, we woke up early and went to Gyeongbokgung Palace. There provided many kinds languages of guided tour to introduce the Gyeongbokgung Palace, and we also joined one guided tour. When the guider started to explain, introduced and we was walking around the Gyeongbokgung Palace slowly. She changed her mind and told me that thanks my recommend. I was happy that she agreed with me it had a strong historical atmosphere in Gyeongbokgung Palace. In my opinion, I will suggest you walk slowly to see and visit that non-commercial, silence environment."
3887,5.0,"It was a good place to explore and understand the history and culture of the korean during old days. I would suggest for travelers who interested of knowing more about culture and history, shall spend at least 3 hours to complete the whole palace. A free guided tour in English, Chinese, Japanese and other language are available at selected time slot (may get this information from the website). The tour takes about 1 hour to 1 and half hour with a guide to explain and story-telling about the history and what are the building for. However, the free guided tour was a targeted tour on selected spots, therefore to cover the full palace, you may need to explore on your own after that and there is also a museum which you can visit for free admission. To make your money worth if you are a fans of understanding the history and culture, you may get the Royal Palaces Ticket which come along with secret garden entrance at 10,000 won instead of paying one palace for 3,000 won per pax."
3888,5.0,A must visit place. Subway station is connected to the monument. Follow the directions and markings in the subway station.  Last entry in the Palace is 1600 HRS. Try to be there before 3:00 PM. The Museum next to Palace is free. Museum is open until 6 pm. There is a good souvenir shop in the basement of the museum.
3889,4.0,This place is good for the one who like to discover the Korean culture. It's large. Should go with tour guide to get fully knowledge.
3890,5.0,"Be prepared to travel back in time in Korea. Brilliant architecture (if that's what they call the palace artwork), intricate and delicate designs. Went here expecting nothing but just a palace but left with so much admiration with Korean history. Don't miss the changing of the guards, check the website for the times. you can take selfies with guards but they will never smile for you. When i went here, there were heaps of Korean kids in their traditional costumes which as beyond amazing! Very pretty and very traditional. It felt like I was in a Korean village from way back then. It gets very busy so goodluck with the crowd."
3891,4.0,Plenty of marvelous historical strolling. Right downtown. Near Insadong arts street and near the main performing arts Sejong Center. Relax and get out of traffic.
3892,5.0,An awesome place to visit and see some of the history of such a great country. The Changing of the Guard Ceremony should not be missed. If you visit this palace you will not be disappointed.
3893,3.0,It's a sprawling complex so comfy shoes are essential. We used an audio guide which was very helpful in explaning the background of the palace.
3894,4.0,"At first, I thought that Gyeongbokgung is quite small, but then it is totally big which took me around 2 hours going around. This palace also provides night tour which should be bought in advance."
3895,4.0,"Nice palace located in the centre of Seoul. Come when they have guard changing ceremony, really great"
3896,5.0,Very nice Palace.. but you must have a tourist guide in order to understand the function of the selective buildings
3897,5.0,"It's the main Palace of Seoul. It's interesting to visit since it gives the possibility to learn some Korean history. I would suggest to take part to a guided tour, it takes about 60minutes and gives the possibility to understand the most important information about the history of the Palace."
3898,4.0,"With quite a few different palaces to visit, we decided on this one by pure luck. It's super easy to get to with a subway station nearby. We decided to wait for the English guided tour and it was definitely worth it! The museum that's onsite is also good. Plan on spending at least 2 hours there and wear comfortable shoes for all the walking required."
3899,5.0,Lovely place just beautiful and traditional thing to see one of the most famous tour spot and it starts to open at night time with beautiful night lights you should plan your schedule for night visit if you like cultural sights and calm atmosphere.
3900,4.0,It was a cultural experience for us. The palace compound was huge and it could easily take a whole day trip. They have nice sites inside and my friends and I were anle to take wonderful photos. It was like a throwback to ancient Seoul and it was a nice experience. We were even able to catch the changing of the guards which was a good exeperience. Bring water when you go here as stores and vending machines are far in between. Try to go early as it gets very crowded easily.
3901,4.0,"Located right across city hall station, you will have to pay an admission to get in to see the sights and sounds of the palace. Great views and nice walks inside. At the entrance, there is a performance done every 2 hours or so by the palace performers and after, you could take pictures with them."
3902,5.0,"Absolutely cool. I could imagine King's movement at this place. Interesting walls, building shapes, especially the roofs. very interested."
3903,5.0,"This palace has quiet wide area. But you won't feel too tired to explore the whole building, because it offers a very beautiful scenery. If you like to explore the historical areas, this place is recommended!"
3904,4.0,"The biggest of the 5 Palaces. Once stepped in, feel like you are transported back to the hundreds years ago. If you are wearing the traditional korean costumes, entrance is free, and your photo with the palace will look like you are in Historical Korean Drama. The inside of each building is very minimally decorated & furnished, big contrast with lavish style in Chinese Palace or European castle. Anyway, keep going to the back & towards the garden & you will see more tourist here than the palace itself. Snap a photo at the pond with the tower in the middle, & the mountain as the background. The view is simply stunning."
3905,5.0,Palace is nice and big. Good photo opportunities as we came early November. The leaves are still turning brown. The change guards ceremony is recommended. If u arent interested in history or pictures and prefer shopping then skip this otherwise this will be a good sightseeing place. Entrance fees is cheap. 3000 won for adults. Children below 7 is free
3906,3.0,"As Palaces go it is rather standard and the changing of the guard...Well there are other impressive places around the World to see the same sort of thing. However, it is worth a visit. The Changing of the Guard is at 1000hrs and at 1400hrs.  The costumes of the guards are very interesting and colourful but probably not very practical! As In London, you are allowed to pose with the gate guards!"
3907,5.0,"I was lucky to visit it on the country's National Culture Day, which they allowed the entrance for free! It's an amazing place to discover the history of South Korea, great for photography too, a bit crowded with tourists, at the time I went (1pm) the guards were there with their cool ancient uniforms and weapons which cool to see, also a lot of people like to pay to dress up on the traditional costumes and wonder around the palace, which I find quite cool to have that opportunity."
3908,5.0,"This Palace,is the residence of the Emperor during the Seong dynasty. It offers a great insight into the living style and architecture of the era. In terms of magnificence, it matches the Forbidden City in Beijing."
3909,5.0,"It's in Seoul but when you are there you feel miles away from the city, mountains in the background, a lake with a fab pavillion to look at - absolutely brilliant to look at and spend some time there"
3910,5.0,"Nice palace with great view, great culture and great history. You will require at least 2-4 hours to spend time and roam around. Must see if you are tourist."
3911,4.0,"A visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace with a guide will give you a glimpse of imperial life during the Chosun dynasty. Total visit will probably take only about an hour at the most starting with the public areas and continuing to the private chambers of the king and the queen. The palace is located in the heart of the city and is quite accessible. In terms of grandeur, it cannot compare to the Imperial Palace in Beijing but we were told that this was intentional given the political situation at that time in history."
3912,3.0,"I visited other 2 palaces before comming here, and found it's big, and I was very tired and hungry at that time, so I ended the visiting within 1 hour. exactly, 2-2.5 hours would be better."
3913,4.0,"The main palace in Seoul and also attracts the most tourists. However, we didn't go in the palace since it has empty spaces only and most of the rooms were closed."
3914,4.0,There's quite a walk from the start to finish. We're on a tour in Oct and the weather was perfect for this site visit even though the temp climbed to 20 degree Celsius.
3915,4.0,"I had to cross the main road (traffic lights road) to the main gate of this palace. Luckily we got experienced to see the morning "" morning guard ceremony"" with the traditional/ancient musics. And also there is Interpretation Services Offered Tours depart in front of the information center at Heungnyemun Gate.Duration: About 1 hr - 1 hr 30 min. If not mistaken, This palace were once destroyed by fire during the Imjin War but then all of the palace buildings were later restored during the King Gojong (overheard the explanation by interpretator). 3000₩ / enterance and closed every tuesday.. the opening hours is depends on the seasons. ~plan your trip peeps..hv a nice travel here in s.korea~"
3916,4.0,"I stumbled to this place after walking through the insa-dong street neighborhoods.  There is an entrance fee of 3000 KRW, about $3 u.s. dollars and it's worth the price. I did not join any tour groups, I explored and wandered on my own. The place can get dusty as the interior of the palace grounds are all light gravel. I visited this place on a weekday during the morning hours and it was somewhat crowded with mostly young kids on a field trip.  The place could be toured with in 60-90 minutes"
3917,5.0,Visited the palace and garden on 30 th October 2016. Beautiful autumn colours. Don't miss live changing guard ceremony. Rich with Korean culture. Must see palace.
3918,5.0,I learned a lot about architecture from visiting this palace. Also a lot about Korean history. It is well worth a visit.
3919,5.0,The palace is huge but it's relaxing to walk around the area. Great place to understand a little of the history of Korea. Good place for photography.
3920,5.0,"Visited the palace and garden on a busy Sunday. Beautiful and well maintained palace, beautiful colors, clean facilities and nice shop. Certainly worth the visit!"
3921,5.0,"It's a great place and it's well preserved. It remains intact and is situated in front of the Blue House, and behind the statue of King Sejong. If you want to know more about South Korea's history, this is the way to go.  It only took us a 3-5 min. Walk from our guesthouse, (Guesthouse Korea). There was a performance for like every 20 mins or so? Where performers dress up as the way that people dressed before and did the rituals etc. To depict the old times. At the end of the ceremony, some performers stand outside the palace and station there where you can take a picture with them (Proper manners and gestures should be observed. They'll feel violated if you get touchy with them.)  Inside, I can say that the overall palace is well-maintained. The comfort rooms are also great. Once you get out, you will see the front of the Blue House, you can also take a stroll in the side walks to enjoy the streets of Korea while enjoying the views of the falling leaves of the tree's"
3922,4.0,"This is a good tour to learn historical Korea. You will find a couple of grand palaces in that big compound. If you come in before 10 am, there you'll see a live marching guard like in Buckingham Palace in Korean version. It will run for about 30 minutes. If you come in wearing a hanbok or traditional costume of Korea, your admission fee is free! To my surprise, quite a number of locals came wearing their hanbok..Those who wore them became instant Hollywood stars...why? They look cute & blend well with the palaces on the background so those tourists took advantages of those nice shots as souvenir! By the way, if you're interested, few hanbok rentals is just near outside the palace itself. Go for it!!"
3923,5.0,"I'll admit I was lucky. I was there on the one(?) day of the year that those who wear traditional Korean outfits got in free. The site was abundant with traditional attire. That enhanced the tour. It's a non-rush tour. It was enjoyable, pleasant, had hidden places to sit and relax. A tour guide would be helpful to learn more, but wandering alone was fine. Go near all the way to the north to see the pond. Sit, relax and enjoy. Once you finish, visit the free museum just to the west, by the subway entrance. If you're a history buff, you'll enjoy."
3924,5.0,"Very nice place to take photos with traditional hanbok, did I mention you get free admissions too while wearing hanbok to palaces! You can see the change of guards ceremony, check out music performances. We went during the autumn season, so the trees were all turning red and it was very pretty."
3925,5.0,One of the largest and oldest palaces in the region. Nice architecture. Very well maintained. Beautiful symmetry to the place.
3926,5.0,This place is a must go when visiting Seiul for the first time. The weather was nice and cool so it was very relaxing to walk and enjoy the beautiful scenery of the palace and nature. Bring a camera and take lots of pictures so you can remember how beautiful this place is. 😀
3927,5.0,A fantastic walk through history with some great photo opportunities. Lots of atmosphere. Much better on a sunny day.
3928,5.0,Huge palace. Ancient buildings in the middle of very modern ones. This is funny and a great symbol of all the contrast that happen in this great city.
3929,5.0,"It was cultural day when we went to the palace. Hence, there was free admission and it was crowded with students. Nevertheless, some of the spots in the palace were very scenic with mountain backdrop. There was performance on the guards changing ceremony before we enter the palace and we also saw the fake king and queen doing their stroll in the palace with their guards. If you follow them, they will lead you to this pavilion with gorgeous backdrop for photo-taking. The architectural was beautiful and I love the lake especially. It was a good photo taking spot."
3930,4.0,Went there during day time. It was crowded but still okay. I saw a lot of people wearing hanbok and it feels like I was in the ancient time. Nice garden. The place is well maintained and clean.
3931,5.0,"Visited last October 16, 2016 Gyeongbokgung Palace is the main palace. This is the only palace we visited during our trip. We toured the place and it was huge and beautiful. The walls and designs are lovely. Please dont miss the changing of the guards ceremony. It's a very interesting show.  Try wearing hanbok so you can enter the palace free of charge."
3932,4.0,"Visited Seoul twice and finally made a visit to the Palace. The night tour was simply amazing and they only have 500 tickets allocated for foreign visitors each night. 3,00 won per entry and it is worth every penny. Check out their performances as well."
3933,4.0,Didn't get to see the inside of the palace because we didn't realise it closed at 4pm. Was in the courtyard and the views were lovely. A mix of old and new as the buildings are nestled among the skyscrapers and mountains. We visited the museum exhibits instead which were well laid out and had some excellent animations for clearer explanations. The reading room has a booth with ports to charge your phone. Very useful.
3934,4.0,The visit was during summer. It was hot and humid. Bring over umbrella to protect you from direct sun. The palace is very huge so expect to spend 3 hours to complete whole course. The guard march is at the courtyard before the palace entrance and make sure you find a spot near by the palace entrance to get clear view.
3935,4.0,"The palace is centrally located and directly link with subway. The entrance fee is 3000won per adult. In compare with the palace in China and Thailand, this palace seems not as luxury as others. There was not much decorations can be seen and just similar to a large park. There are lot of local people dressing in their native clothing and taking photos in the palace. The palace is a nice place to have leisure walks during holiday."
3936,5.0,Interesting place to visit! See guard changing is a must! Opened every day from 9am to 6pm unless Tuesday!
3937,4.0,"Best time to go, I would say is during autumn. The palace has a small garden somewhere in the outskirts, the autumn leaves make it that much more worth the scenary."
3938,5.0,"Make sure to watch the changing of the guards in the morning. You may want to visit during a weekday, too."
3939,5.0,This is one of the places which we have visited many times in different seasons. There's a Hanbok rental shop which you just need to register and you can wear Hanbok for 15mins
3940,4.0,"Awed by the grandeur of the palace. The biggest and the grandest of all the 5 palaces. There were a lot of people from different nationalities. Saw the 3 buddhas. It has the King’s office, A huge kitchen, king’s hall where he entertains his visitors. I even posed with the palace guards. Truly beautiful!"
3941,5.0,"Great stop in downtown Seoul. I stumbled across this as i had a couple of hours to spare u til hotel checkout time. It was a quick walk from my hotel, and I arrived just in time to see the changing of the guard. The compound is so big that the mass that had gathered to watch the changing of the guard quickly dispersed as we entered the compound. The fee was under $3 USA to enter--totally worth the proce. Fun total see the architecture and layout. I wish I had spent more time here!"
3942,5.0,How many times does one get to see a palace built in 1395? The grounds are vast and the dirt base can be uneven. It's a pleasure to walk around and see the history and beautiful architecture. I strongly recommend you let one of the High School students give you a free tour. They are perfecting their English (and other languages) while sharing their history. Very interesting.
3943,4.0,"Small, pretty, well-preserved. Worth visiting in Seoul. However, if you've seen the Forbidden City, then there is nothing particularly spectacular or grand about this place. I enjoyed it because I love Asian architecture, and enjoyed the animal sculptures throughout the place which are a bit different from the ones I've seen in China. Can get crowded with school groups visiting. Wear your hanbok for free admission."
3944,5.0,"The biggest palace in Seoul. A lot of beautiful buildings to see. Its strongly recommended to buy combined ticket for all the palaces (5) - 10 000 W and try the guided tour. Its free, all guides speak fluent english and explain all that you can see."
3945,4.0,"Love their free tour guide service. She explained well on the history of almost each building and kept it lively. however, we miss the guard changing ceremony"
3946,4.0,"We had a wonderful time there. We rent hanbok/traditional korean clothes at a store outside nearby the palace to get free entrance inside the palace.  It wasnt that crowded when i visited, so i managed to take quite a few good photos"
3947,4.0,Went by day and by night and preferred the night experience especially the light and dance shows which were very uplifting - left with a nice happy warm feeling!!  Fascinated by all the locals dressing up to get their photos taken - was even tempted but too tight to pay the $50 charge!
3948,5.0,"Very popular with tourists. A lot of people but still very nice to walk around. I would take a whole day as the place very big.  Around 2pm, there is a changing guards in front.  Bring your drinks and foods to sit inside and have break. It would be a nice place to have some drink and food."
3949,4.0,This is a small place to take a stroll.... I visited here ten years ago and this time it was packed with Chinese tourists...shockingly many of them. And some crazy boys running here and there I simply couldn't enjoy this place.. Visit here on week days..  주중에 방문하실 것을 권해드립니다 주말에는 중국인 관광객을 비롯하여 떠들고 설치고 분위기를 해치는 요소들이 너무 많았답니다
3950,5.0,"This is another gem in Seoul. Make sure to travel around the entire property, there numerous little spots that have to be searched for. Go early in the morning."
3951,5.0,"If you like temples and have the time, a wander through the gardens and temples is very relaxing. Autumn colors added to the interest this visit and I would visit again."
3952,4.0,"This palace is very impressive, however, it is the most popular one in tourists and therefore very crowded. This does not add to its atmosphere. If you leave the central parts of the palace and wander around in the park, it becomes much more solitary. If you like quieter spots, visit the other palaces in Seoul (which are impressive as well!)."
3953,5.0,Very nice and interesting. Highly recommend the free English speaking tour which is daily 3 times a day. Only need to pay the entry ticket. Absolutely must see while in Seoul.
3954,5.0,My second time here but this time during much better weather. It's a beautiful palace and we got in for free for wearing hanboks!
3955,4.0,"Join the English guide and learn to appreciate the history and architecture of this beautiful Palace. If you are a historical K-drama fan you will now be able to see and experience the beautiful architecture, the Throne Hall and the Pavilion you see so often in the dramas.  If you are in a Hanok you get in free of charge, saving 3,000 won.  I visited the Palace after Bukchon Hanok Village and Samcheong-dong. All are within walking distance"
3956,5.0,Nice palace and greenery around. There were lots of people though so its hard to get a good picture with no one behind you. Also saw lots of youngsters dressed in their traditional costume.
3957,3.0,"Well maintain historical building and museum. We can find lots of Korean teenager wearing hanbok (traditional Korean costum), we can ask them to take a picture for free."
3958,5.0,"Fun palace, but the best part to me was the views of the mountains against the old buildings as well as the wonderful park/gardens around the perimeter."
3959,5.0,"Only $3 for tourists, must bring passports. This place normally closes at 5 so seeing it in the dark is cool. There was also a light show and traditional dance at the end around 9:30PM. Highly recommended as it doesn't occur often."
3960,5.0,"So apparently they do this night viewing only for a couple of weeks, dont miss it.  They only give 500 tickets to foriegners so line up early if you want to get in, around 6PM is best.  The place ia filled with young beautiful Koreans dressed in the traditional Hanboek, and the detail of the buildings are very clear in the splash of lights upon them surrounded by darkness of the evening  But the best part was light and traditional dance Show at the King's Pavilion.  When you step through the main gates it is as if you have been transported back in time lost in a beautiful ancient world of kings and beautiful people surround by the works of great craftsmen.  The light show was an amazing display of Korean Technology mixed with their ancient dance and art.  I was just wowed!!!  I love Korea!!!!"
3961,3.0,Very lovely palace complex but there is not a huge amount to see apart from the buildings. It would be better if there were some exhibitions in it. I did take the audio guide but again would be good to have more detail etc on the guide.  There was one very nice lake at the back but it just needs a little something more.
3962,5.0,We arrived at 2:00PM just in time for the changing of the guards. I highly recommend seeing this ceremony as it helps one imagine what it must have been like hundreds of years ago at the palace. It is not abundantly clear but you need a ticket to enter the inner courtyard and you can purchase them on the far right of the outer courtyard. Once inside you can peer into throne rooms and walk around the grounds. We were treated to a concert of traditional instruments out in front of the coffee shop (note: every Korean tourist attraction will have at least one coffee shop). One other treat was the high percentage of people walking around in Hanbok (the traditional Korean garb). Wear your walking shoes. This place is not very wheelchair accessible.
3963,5.0,We took the Free Korea Transit Tour to Seoul that included the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Interesting way to spend a morning. Nice introduction to Korea history.
3964,5.0,I was proposed at this palace so this place holds a dear memory in my heart. This is a beautiful palace with lots of history! I recommend getting a tour guide to get a better understand about this place. The architecture and the colors are beautiful! It's a great place to wear hanbock and go on a tour. The admission fee is cheap and it's worth a visit!
3965,5.0,"This is a year round good, must see palace when in Seoul. Beautiful grounds, even better when you coincide your visits with the guard changing ceremony. We were lucky to see the guard inspection ceremony reanactment and display of martial arts. Entrance is free if you rent a hanbok costume. Plenty of rental shop in the vicinity as well in Buchon Hanok village which is just a short stroll away. Or you can buy a booklet of combo tickets to all the palaces and jongmo shrine for 10,000 won. Don't miss the floating Pavillion on the left."
3966,4.0,"I think gyeongbokgung palace one of must visit in korea. But not suitable when you want ""healing situation"". When I visit, there a fan meeting or shooting program. Oh, so crowded with fans screaming everywhere"
3967,4.0,"the palace has its history and is well maintained. good for first time visitor to visit... however, do try to go on weekday... it was super crowded on weekend."
3968,4.0,"Very nice park, rather large. Relaxing place for a walk. Some beautiful buildings. Shows a glimp of how korea used to be. Very touristic."
3969,4.0,Beautiful place. You can go for a long walk - learn a lot and try the old tradition te. Very close to centrum.
3970,5.0,I've been here several times before but this is the first time I visited at night. We were lucky that on this trip there was a special night session for autumn. It's still the same admission price and it's open from 6-10pm but lines start forming at 5pm. There are limited stilts for both tourists and locals so be sure to come early. There were exhibits and a traditional Korean dance and program showcasing their culture and the story of King Sejong (?). It was held in one of the pavilions on the lake and with the full moon it was just breathtaking! There were a lot of young people dressed in the traditional hanbok because they get to come in free :-)
3971,5.0,"First thing we did when arrived in Korea was visiting Gyeongbok palace. Good spot to start your visit in Seoul, where you can learn about history. Ticket is not expensive, and you can buy a special pass to visit all the temples and palaces in the area with a discount."
3972,5.0,"This is a must for any visitor to Seoul, the grounds are massive! Many visitors every day but as the are is so large it is not overcrowded. Many teenagers and young adults dress up in traditional costume for photo sessions, pretty entertaining."
3973,4.0,Visited the palace and gardens with my wife and 14m old son. Great place to stroll around and to take some beautiful pictures.
3974,5.0,"This huge palace complex is stunning, comparable to the best in the world. Every courtyard or space reveals new treasures and, despite being crowded, peace can be found around many a corner. An absolute must-see if in Korea!"
3975,4.0,The palace is closed on Tuesday though. It's crowded inside. We managed to take better photos from the National Museum outside.
3976,4.0,"If you are a history buff and plan to visit any of the palaces, and if you have only a very limited time, I would suggest that you visit Gyeongbokgung.It is close to Insadong and Bukchon hanok village. You can sort of do all there in one day. Mind you, there is a lot of walking to do, so be prepared.I was not very impressed by the changing of the palace guard, but if you have the time go for it.Check out the timing for this, as they do this only twice a day, depending on the weather. However, do not avoid the palace visit just because you missed the changing of the guard."
3977,5.0,"As I rode the bus from Incheon Airport to my hotel in Jongno, I got my first glimpse of Gyeongbokgung Palace. It was way after midnight and the lights from the outer gate and just the presence of seeing a palace for the first time blew me away. I visited the palace and it was such a wonder to see."
3978,5.0,"During our time in South Korea, being the history buffs we are, we purchased the Integrated Pass for Palaces, which basically gave us tickets and access for all five major palaces for 10,000 won, as compared to 14,000 won if purchased individually instead. From our visits, we could safely say that out of the five, Gyeongbokgung Palace seemed to be the most well known, and perhaps unfortunately, the most crowded too.  We happened to visit during the Golden Week holiday period in China, and that meant hordes of Chinese tourists swarming the Geunjeongjeon, or Throne Hall. It would have been a little more ideal if I had been able to secure a slot for the night tour, where the crowd is much lesser and it is more beautiful for night photography. Luckily, it seems that most tour groups bring their tourists to the Geunjeongjeon area only. Beyond that, if you are willing to walk more and more further, you will be rewarded with less crowds.  The architectural style of the palace is somewhat closer to the Ming Dynasty style, such as the Forbidden Palace for example. This is in contrast to the other palaces such as Changdeokgung Palace, which has a more traditional Korean style. It might look similar at first glance, but on closer inspection, some differences can be seen. The Gyeongbokgung Palace that is seen standing today is actually a reconstruction and restoration, as the original one was sadly demolished during the Japanese colonial era in 1915. Still, the amount and scale that has been restored so far is astonishing and must be seen first hand to understand the very soul of Korea better.  The National Folk Museum of Korea happens to be inside Gyeongbokgung Palace and it can provide a respite from the heat with the building itself being air-conditioned. The exterior of the museum is quite beautiful and is worthy of some great shots. There is also the Hyangwonjeong Pavilion that is worth walking far enough for a great shot.  You should not miss the royal guard changing ceremonies done by reenactors that take place at Gwanghwamun, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace at 10 am and 2 pm. The ceremony takes about 20 minutes and it is an experience you should not miss. You can even take photos with the royal guards after the ceremony too!  Do take note that Gyeongbokgung Palace is closed on Tuesdays and sometimes it may close if it gets too crowded, so do plan accordingly. A night tour would be even better if you are able to get a slot. This is an excellent place to see both the locals and tourists in Hanbok, the Korean national costume, since those in Hanbok get in for free. If you want less crowds however, I would strongly suggest Changdeokgung Palace instead if you only have time for one palace to visit."
3979,5.0,"Great place for pictures, go on a weekday if you can because weekends can get overcrowded with tourist buses. It was amazing to walk around and sight see. Very beautiful and it was very memorable. It is not very friendly to strollers, especially in the entrance areas. It will not be a smooth ride. I recommend baby wearing if possible."
3980,4.0,This is right across from my office and have been staring at it through the window every business trip. Decided to check it out. The palace is ok not very elaborate like others around the world. A guided tour may have been interesting. The change of guards is good.
3981,5.0,"There are several things you need to do it in the palace or else you will regret in your visit 1) Bring a good camera so you can take some magnificient picture of the Palace 2) After pay the ticket, go right of the palace to check out the tea serving ceremony or rice cake ceremony so you can taste and learn some , as the class or ceremony is depended on the timing 3) Have pictures with the soldiers there 4) Have pictures with the pretty korean with hanok ( korean costume ) 5) Have fun jumping and running as it is really huge!  The last thing is, visit every single corner of the palace and it is sweet enough if you can take some nice pictures with the nice scenery with your love one!"
3982,5.0,"You should visit this place during chuseok, although is a bit crowded, but many cultural activities, free hanbok experiences happening during this time!  香远亭就是所谓的宫内后院，也是我最喜欢的地方。。 醉香桥，景如其名。。 令人陶醉的独木桥与充满香气的莲花池左右作伴！ 那个朝代，这里应该是最让人舒缓压力的地方了！"
3983,3.0,"Was here, there is some kind of park around the palaces, but nothing ""wow"", just a traditional-style buildings. Worth visiting once when it's your first time in Seoul, but I wouldn't recommend it as some great attraction"
3984,4.0,beautiful vast grounds & well preserved structures. Very thankful for our Goodwill Volunteer Tour guide whose stories brought us back to the past amazing life of the royals and its people in the palaces.
3985,5.0,It was so great when Harry was teaching us about the history here in Gyeongbukgung Palace. I was amazed by how they maintain the structure of this place and the cleanliness too.
3986,4.0,"The palace is a must-go site if you are first time traveler to Seoul. We spen around 2-3 hour in this palace. However, minus point is that it always crowded. Small bonus point is you can rent a traditional clothes nearby and go into the palace to take picture"
3987,4.0,"This park had many interesting buildings and highlights. At only $1, it was worth it to walk through and look around. I wish there was more information about it that we could have read. Perhaps we should have rented the headphones."
3988,5.0,We really enjoyed visiting this palace. Its the best we saw during our stay in Seoul. Do not miss the ceremony when the guards change.
3989,5.0,"This palace is located in the city and its just enormous. On the back it goes all the way back in to the mountains with a nice lake and park. The buildings are superb, its the highlight of Seoul."
3990,4.0,"I would say a must if you're visiting Seoul. Or only is admission cheap but you get to go into the palace. I like going to historical places and they do have people dressed up as guards that you could take pictures with, also gives you access to the national museum."
3991,5.0,"We chose to visit Gyeongbok Palace over other palaces due to time constraint and it was a very worthwhile visit. We were marveled at the architecture in a very distinct Korean way and the detailed danchung painting of the roof overhang. In addition, Goenghoeru Pavillion in the pond was an outstanding idea to have a royal reception or celebration among noble people. Walking northbound, we were able to see a part of neighboring Chungwadae which is the residence of the Korean President in the backdrop of a mountain and it was absolutely beautiful. For the entertainment, there are changing guard procedure and military drill as the King watching. This can't be compared to the changing guard performance of Buckingnam Palace in London in quality, but it adds to understanding of the Joseon Dynasty. I highly recommend to visit the palace and the surrounding area. One can finish touring in as little as 1 hour or all day long."
3992,5.0,"Went there with the tour from the US , and this Palace was one of the attraction, we love the visit ,See all Palaces the learn Korean culture and History and shoots lot of pic . it was just great."
3993,4.0,Come early morning as soon as it opens for a peaceful walk around and good photo opportunities. Gets crazy crowded and noisy as it gets closer to lunch. Also a good idea to set aside time to do the National Folk Museum here as it's just to the side of the palace. Must see if you have not been to Seoul before.
3994,4.0,"We were in Seoul for 5 days but only chose to visit one Palace, and after research it was obvious to me this was the one to go to. My reason? It's the birthplace of the Joseon Dynasty. When the capital was moved to Seoul, this was the first Palace, and the entire walled city of Seoul at the time was designed around this Palace. We went less for the architecture and more for the history and layout- specifically, with the mountain as a backdrop and the pond in the rear. Walking thru and spending time in the adjacent dongs, all which had their own purpose serving this Palace, made their history all the more interesting as well.  You can reasonably do the Palace in one hour, and there are free English guided tours available 3 times each day- check the times on their website to plan your visit."
3995,4.0,There are multiple palaces in Seoul so I would recommend to only visit Gyeongbokgung if there is any time constraint. Tip: admission fee is waived if you visit in Korean traditional clothing. There is a shop opposite the palace that you can rent from but I would recommend to rent them at Insadong as it is MUCH cheaper (40k vs 14k for 4 hours) :)
3996,3.0,It might be boring to many people but it's amazing for history lover. It's very huge and needs time to walk there. Especially that there is also museum. I will recommend any one want to visit it 6 hours. يمكن ان يكون هذا المكان ممل للعديدين ولكنه سيكون وجهة تشد المهتمين بالتاريخ. المكان كبير جدا ويحتاج وقت للتنقل مشيا على الأقدام وخصوصا ان هنالك متخف بجانبه. انصح بتخصيص ٦ ساعات على الأقل لهذه الفعالية.
3997,4.0,A nice palace with lot of history. Easily reachable via the metro. Just follow instructions when you reach the metro station and you will never get lost.
3998,4.0,"The palace is huge, with a lot of buildings. Walking is easy though, as it's mostly flat. The palace features the mountains as its backdrop, enhancing its picturesque quality. The ponds are beautiful, and we're built to reflect the mountains' beauty.  Make sure to see the changing of the guard ceremony at 10am or 2pm. Go a bit before then as they also have a short parade outside the side gate with the guards making in formation."
3999,5.0,Majestic palace which offers a glance to the splendour past. Several palaces with its history plus a leisure park and lake dotted the landscape. Be sure to watch guard changing ceremony. A refuge from busy city just a step away
4000,4.0,"The palace, the views -everything is gorgeous. I would definitely recommend people to spend some time here."
4001,4.0,"we took hop-on hop-off tour bus and with various stops you can get off and get on, the route was pretty good and inexpensive.."
4002,1.0,Nice garden outside the museum and palace . The palace look nice but the facades and even interior looked so freshly painted and lacked historic feel but nice to see pretty ladies in traditional hanbok.
4003,5.0,"The palace is impressive in itself. Also impressive is the way it is taken care of, including keeping its background view of mountains, in center Seoul with all the high rises around it. A real monument to Korea's past."
4004,5.0,"Catch the changing of the guard ceremony, dress up in Hanbok, join a free tour, visit the museum afterwards.. you could spend the best part of a day just on this one location alone :)"
4005,5.0,The palace complex was actually hugh! The palace itself was really beautiful and grand. The architecture of all the buildings in the palace complex the really mesmerizing. I was particularly impressed with the Royal Guards manning the entrance. They were awesome.
4006,5.0,"Visited at the end of the day and it was superb. No large groups so the place was quiet, almost serene, the surroundings are lovely and the buildings interesting. Can easily find a quiet spot to read a book. I didn't go with a guide and later regretted as I believe it would have made the visit even more enjoyable."
4007,4.0,As one of the most popular tourist spot in Seoul. Prepare for huge crowd of tourists and buses in the area.  Very nice place to visit and add knowledge of korean history.  There is a show at the gate once in a an hour (might change) where guards will perform a war march.
4008,3.0,There are site with nice views but didn't offer much to see since most rooms are barred from entrance. Only peeking from windows are allowed. But quite a place to visit anyway. Love the lakes though.
4009,5.0,"Gyeongbukgung, or known as Gyeongbuk Palace. It was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty built in 1395. I never expected that I can be so fascinated by visiting palace, guess the details and the richness of the beautiful architectures drew me into it."
4010,4.0,"As with all my reviews to sights in Seoul I will preface this by advising visitors to carefully check opening days and times and whether timed entry tickets are needed to access certain parts of the attraction and also the times for booking guided tours in their language of preference – bearing in mind that numbers can be limited  The palace and grounds occupy a large open space and although the attraction gets very busy (especially with school parties) there are quiet places that can be found to enjoy the architecture and the scale of the palace. Most of the buildings are highly decorative and have been heavily restored and in some cases recreated. If staying in Seoul for some time I would suggest buying the ""all in "" ticket giving access to all the main palaces in the city"
4011,4.0,"I've been to Gyeongbokgung a few times. My first was in the middle of winter, and not all of the ponds had water, no leaves on the trees.... It was all pretty bleak. I went another time in fall with my sister. We got there in time for the changing of the guard ceremony which is worth scheduling around if you can. My third visit was on a special evening opening. I had to book a ticket online. I went, like most others, with a tripod and my DSLR to try and get some sweet pictures. There was a full moon that night, so we weren't disappointed."
4012,3.0,A half day well spent surrounded by friendly and smiling local visitors. Monuments descriptions could be more detailed though if you have any interest in the actual historical facts
4013,5.0,I went at 9am before the crowds. A delightful way to spend and an hour or two wandering around beautiful palaces and even some wildlife to see!
4014,5.0,"Geongbokgung Palace is majestic! This is a must visit if you're visiting Seoul. If you can visit during night time (only open few months of the year), it's absolutely beautiful. With a view of the mountain in the background, it's a paradise for photography enthusiasts. Lots of history behind this palace and if you time do checkout the museum to learn about the history. They have free guided tours in English."
4015,5.0,It's a one of THE places to visit if you only have a limited time in Seoul. Huge palace grounds and gardens to explore. It can get really crowded at times so avoid the weekend crowds or school holidays.
4016,2.0,"Scenery is good. But, it will be pressed against the historical recognition. Good things will be on the bad. I will not revisit absolutely."
4017,4.0,"There are quite a few palaces in Seoul. The sheer size and scenic location within the city with the mountains in the background, as well it's historical significance make it a must-see in my opinion. It's located fairly centrally and easily accessible via the metro. There are also quite a few other museums located nearby. Our ticket allowed us free entry into the Folk Museum (or Children's Folk Museum? or both, I can't remember). You can spend hours walking around here. You can't enter the chambers or rooms but you can walk through the main structures and there are a lot of them! Wear good walking shoes.  There are many ramps around so it's also very wheelchair and stroller accessible. Clean bathrooms with toilet paper, soap and water are also on site. In order to visit the pavilion, I believe you need to make an advance reservation online. A visit to this palace can be as short or long as you want, but if you want to see most of it (at a leisurely walking pace), you should allot at least 2 hours.  It's felt smaller than the Forbidden City in Beijing China, and the restorations seemed more apparent. Still, the buildings and layout were beautiful."
4018,5.0,"This palace is quite massive, when I first saw the image in TripAdvisor, I thought it was just one building and that was it. I was quite surprised by how huge this palace is. Most of the tourist are just in the front area of the building and probably left thereafter. If you want to see the entire palace, be prepared to walk quite a bit and spend at least 2 hours there. The palace is quite beautiful and well maintained. I highly recommended to visit this place. We were there on Oct 2. which was a Korean holiday, lots of people dress up in traditional clothing and take pictures in the palace, quite interesting to see. Looks like some tourist also dress up and take pictures against the palace. We arrived around 2 pm and there were so many tourists there, I wish we arrived earlier, it would probably be nicer and less crowded."
4019,5.0,"Beautiful grounds to explore filled with heritage and history and pride for nationality.  Photographers paradise.  Beautiful gardens, seemed to be a popular place for children and teens to go dressed in traditional clothing to take photos - which I was told would be as gifts for family. As a young western woman a lot of the young girls asked for selfies with me which I was happy to oblige and I returned the favour they looked stunning in their traditional dress.  In places it did feel a little busy- lots of people around. But at no point did it feel overwhelming. I got used to the fact that Seoul as a place was densely populated so figured everywhere you went would be people in large numbers.  I loved the juxtaposition of the placement of the place cradled between modern buildings all around was this nugget of history within the city.  Make sure you go with a full battery on your camera or phone. Much needed.  You can enjoy a traditional tea ceremony too. Plenty of literature also to inform all those niggling questions.  A great day out. A lot is in the direct sunlight so if there in summer bring suncream and some coverage but once you get to the gardens there is plenty of cover in the shade."
4020,4.0,"I like the reduced design compared with chinese palaces, even it is quite similar this one is worth visiting"
4021,4.0,Kingdom in the middle of the city. Tourist crowds at this attraction because of its beautiful structure and interesting facts about Korean history. The palace does really get crowded with different tour groups so it's really hard to find a good spot for beautiful shots without tourists around. Overall it's interesting and worth the visit!
4022,5.0,Gyeongbokgung Palace is very historical. Our tourist guide said that it was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty built in 1395. I was so amazed when i knew about it that this palace was so old yet the structure is firm.
4023,5.0,we only spend a short time to see a couple of palaces and this one had a nice changing of the guards
4024,4.0,its was really interesting to see the Gyeongbokkgung Place. Whit the Metro its just to easy to find it.
4025,4.0,"This Palace is very renowned for the Kings of Ancient Korean Dynasty, its a Must Visit Place to know the Korean Dynasty History and Their Culture. The Ticket Prices are very Low and make sure you go on a Weekday, weekends are usually over Crowded."
4026,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung palace is nestled slightly north of Seoul and is walkable if you are staying in there myeongdong neighborhood of Seoul. The palace has several layers and houses multiple palaces.  If you continue to walk in, you will enter the folk museum. Great place to hang out and enjoy history."
4027,5.0,"It was a very nice palace to be around in seoul,with absolutely gorgeous nature and history of korea.. Its must see if some one visit seoul."
4028,5.0,Not to be missed in your itinerary when you go to Seoul. You should go early to witness the first changing of guards which is really amazing. They have a free fit of guards costume. Affordable 3000krw for entry.
4029,5.0,"OH MY GOD! This is a huge area with lots of palaces all connected to each other that makes the whole place feel like a maze! The biuldings are beautiful and the architecture is superb. The decorations are really nice! Just one problem though, there wasn't enouh info about the places in this palace. We didn't want to walk with a tour and wanted to look around on our own pace so we didb't get much info. There's a good resting place with food and drinks and souvenir shop at the entrance. you can get a hanbok and wear it while you go around."
4030,4.0,"The guard-changing ceremony in the first courtyard (with the ticket sale counters) would be quite worthwhile watching.  The entrance to the palace grounds from Gwanghwamun gate looks quite ordinary, but once you get past all the initial buildings and explore the grounds, it's very beautiful with all the trees and lakes. There are very signboards explaining the buildings' histories or usages. If I had gone with the free tour (set times), I'd probably have been more interested in the buildings!"
4031,5.0,"Beautiful place, great to visit on a sunny day. Free English tour is available. There are also nice performances, so you will enjoy your walk."
4032,5.0,"We visited the palace during the Thanksgiving period. Free entrance was a bonus, but would willingly have paid the admittance fee. What a beautiful, relaxing, serene place. Wonderful!!!"
4033,4.0,You should go and see this place. It is like movies. nice and good for walking. It is really big as well !
4034,5.0,Lovely palace to walk round on a beautiful day.There are many buildings and a secret garden.Very cheap entrance fee.
4035,4.0,A good place to hang around. You need to buy tickets to enter. Currency exchange also available near the tickets counter. This palace is large and to see everything you need to do a lot walking. You can try out the traditional costumes of the palace FOC. They'll dress you. You can find costume changing location is in your left side after passing the main entrance.
4036,5.0,"We spent a few hours here this week. Its a truly massive place and its quite busy with tourists. Head through the main gate, watch the changing of the guard (though this is not official - just actors) then spend some time in the museum to get a good overview of the place. Then my suggestion is go further back to get away from the people. You'll enjoy your time here!"
4037,5.0,"The palace complex is so huge~~ only walking around, it took 2hours to finish! But the palace was really beautiful and could see Korean's art and culture! I loved the pond and the small library at the back of it. It was Hyangwon or something. It was really beautiful! Highly recommend to visit here! Go~~!"
4038,4.0,"Well, this palace area is really big, a lot of similar looking palaces and houses and a lot of tourists too, because it's the most famous palace in Seoul. Nevertheless, I think it's mandatory to see this when visiting Seoul. Plus, you get free entrance to a nice museum, to escape the heat like we did when we visitied."
4039,5.0,"We had a Seoul pass which meant we could see all 5, we saw this one third after spending alot of time walking around the other two, which we felt we could've skipped and just go to this one."
4040,5.0,"The palace is located at the centre of the city and accessible by subway. The opening hour is 9:00am. It would be better if you could get there in early hours, as tons of people visit there and it gets quite crowded. It is very interesting to see a bit of old times and culture. There is a big building near the water that you can go inside and take a look, but it requires a reservation at least one day prior. If you would like to see that building, I would recommend that you should check the information in advance."
4041,4.0,"remember to wear shoe to visit this place, as u need to hv long walk and the floor is not flat. sometimes u might need to climb abit and downhill walking. alot of scenery that u might want to take picture, standby ur camera n memory cards. hehe. If you want to see some palace activity like changing shift, make sure to be there before 10am."
4042,5.0,"The first of Seoul's palaces we visited, and by far the most impressive. Incredible architecture & fantastic English guide, who explained so much in so little time. The changing of the guards ceremony was also worth staying to see. Really worth visiting."
4043,5.0,"The place is just marvelous. This is where no-filter IG-worthy pictures are made of. You can join the tours and watch the changing of guards. The entry fee is cheap like around 2,000 won only and there's a lot to see here."
4044,4.0,It's been there over a thousand years in spite of the Japanese burning it down twice. There is a free tour with an English speaking docent that I highly recommend.
4045,5.0,We got the audio guides and walked around by ourselves on a sunny Saturday. It was fabulous - definitely a must see.
4046,4.0,This was very informative about Korean culture and how they lived and suffered from the Japanese. What a major historical reconstruction effort for the Korean people. This is worth a visit.
4047,5.0,"Geongbok palace reminded me Korean Historical Dramas, I was walking in the palace in Hanbok which is a traditional costume which is so beautiful, and you know what? If you are in Hanbok then no entrance fee :) 3000krw though Highly recommend to visit in Hannok"
4048,4.0,We had a private guided tour and this of course was extremely helpful. It is a large complex with a museum - good written explanation as you go with some interactive displays. Very informative and interesting for a European with little knowledge of Korea and its history.
4049,5.0,"Visited last September 17, 2016. If you are a sucker for history and architecture, then this shouldn't be missed when touring Korea! All the palaces are instagram-worthy! The palace is so huge that an hour is not enough! It's like a Mini ""Forbidden City in Beijing"" STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL!"
4050,3.0,"Nice photos to take, but if without a guide its boring, however i guess you can read about it beforehand so that you can enjoy more. Takes around 1 hour to 2 hours depending on how much photos you take :)  There is an option of a combo ticket for 4 palaces and a temple, but although i bought it i do not recommend you do it unless you really enjoy this repetetive rooms and buildings :)  May be just one palace and one temple would be ebough, so no need to pay for the combo ticket  Try not to miss the guard changing ceremony and take photos witg the guards. So do go early (not after 1:30 pm) to be able to attend one of them (held each 15 minutes i guess)"
4051,5.0,It is one of the most important places in Seoul! If you are intersted in history and Korean culture in general dont miss it! They do English tours for free to explain the hlights of this great plalace! You will see many Koreans wearing traditional clothes which is super cool!
4052,4.0,Its really easy to reach this palace. You can take subway then stop at Gyeongbok gung palace station. The interesting thing is you can rent Hanbook and you can feel as korean woman/man. Don't forget to watch replacement of bodyguard of this palace in the morning and also noon. Really recommended.
4053,5.0,"This place is great for all types of travelers. It allows those who like history to be able to read and see about a Korean Dynasty. For those who like architecture and cool structures, it gives you a ton to see and lots of detail to explore. And those who like to just go and walk for a little while, it gives you freedom to explore to your liking. Our favorite part was seeing the changing of the guards and the guard performance at the front gate. And not to mention all the children dressed in authentic Korean clothing while on their school field trips....just adorable! We would totally visit here again."
4054,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the five (5) major palaces in Seoul. If you can, avoid the visit on a weekend as the place becomes very crowded."
4055,3.0,We visited the palace as it's a must for tourists. The palace wasn't huge so it only took around 45 minutes. (Disclaimer: we didn't have a guide or book tour so it was just purely browsing)  The guards at the front gate were interesting and the shift swap process was entertaining. I would recommend a visit.
4056,5.0,"The buildings are amazing and gorgeous. The place is ginormous, so be prepared to walk if you want to stay a while and venture around. There is also a free museum that doesn't require a ticket to get in, unlike The Palace. It would have been nice if there were placards or even a recording in English to understand what each building was used for. Either way, the grounds are beautiful. We went on the wrong day, it was during the holiday and it was packed! We probably would have spent more time there if not for all the people."
4057,5.0,There are a few palaces in Seoul and i believe this is the most significant. There is a museum outside of the palace and it is a good way to relax in the museum after wandering around in the palace under the sun.
4058,4.0,It's amazing being able to visit this palace thanks to major restorations and rebuilding. It is a small version of the Forbidden City in Beijing which reminds us of China's historical and cultural influence over Asia. The admission was free because of Korean Thanksgiving when we visited but I would say it's worth it. There is not many historical sites inside Seoul so this one is a must.  The metro stops right at the entrance.
4059,5.0,We arrived just in time to watch the guard change over. Three mins in it chucks it down leading them to canceling the change over. Don't want to get their costumes and props wet I guess. Still worth getting a ticket as the palace is huge and the foreign escort place surrounded by water was pretty. The folk museum was good too.
4060,4.0,"Looked very lovely - but should be open all days . I arroved in Seoul on a Sunday, but was wrecked. So was all geared up on Monday for a day of sight seeing - Nothing open. Plan ahead. Not too disappointed as this was a business trip and so sightseeing was not the primary reason for visit!"
4061,3.0,The guards at the entrance very interesting. There is not much things to see inside. It was not crowded and probably you need 15 minutes to view the whole palace.
4062,4.0,"I'm not sure if its because I went on a slightly rainy day or if I didn't get to see the changing of the palace guards, but I didn't find Gyeongbukgung as spectacular as I'd hoped. Don't get me wrong, it's absolutely beautiful, larger than life, and really takes you back to what life was like back then for anyone living in the palace, but besides looking around and getting that blast from the past, it was just a [beautiful] building.  However, it's worth a visit if you've never been to a Korean palace! It's always great learning about origins of great nations."
4063,5.0,"The fee is about 1,000 won =$1 USD. There a English tour in the palace but schedule time. Nice places to take pictures and nice ponds."
4064,4.0,"Though smaller than the Forbidden City in Beijing, there is quite a bit of the same sense of Asian greatness of this palace. On a quiet morning visit, it is easy to imagine how this place was once the pinnacle of a civllisation now transformed. The palace is located smack-bang in the middle of bustling Seoul, and although the megacity outside the walls is ever active, noisy and effeciently moving on, time somehow slows when inside. The noises of everyday-life are muffled, and a sense of awe is ever present."
4065,3.0,The guard changing ceremony happens 4 times a day and I was lucky to watch it the moment I arrived. The place is huge but the buildings are quite similar. I can't enter any of the buildings except for the one in the picture. But that one visitors have to reserve entry a day before. There are a few explanation stands on what the building are but make sure to get the brochure from information counter so you get more understanding of the buildings from the visit.
4066,5.0,Who knew that the Korean dynasty was so old or that the 4th king created to Korean language or that it died out because the 27th king was infertile?
4067,5.0,Be sure to rent all a costume at a street leftside the palace. Ask the info for directions and get a 10k won discount coupon
4068,5.0,"I attended a group tour with Koridoor tours to Gyeongbokgung and several other historic sites around Seoul recently. Gyeongbokgung was by far my husband's and my favorite place on the tour. We enjoyed the changing of the guard ceremony when we first arrived, though it was crowded and a bit hard to see the action. After the ceremony, we toured around the palace grounds and were blown away by their beauty. This is a great place to take photos, relax, picnic, and get a history lesson. We plan to return to see the palace in more depth. It is a serene sanctuary right in the middle of Seoul!"
4069,4.0,"You can spend 1 hour or half a day here. It's really up to you. It is very large and on the premise are also the Palace Museum and the National Folk Museum. The palace is beautiful. There are a lot of people wearing the traditional Korean clothes around and it is really nice. At two o'clock, there is a ""guards changing"" ceremony. If you happen to be there, I recommend it, but if you miss it, I don't think you should be sad. The two story structure shown requires Internet reservation a day in advance, so I was kind of bummed that I did not get to go in. I just walked around and took my time and worked up a good appetite for the yummy Korean food I had later."
4070,5.0,The oldest and largest of all 5 palaces in Seoul. We signed up with the Seoul Tourism Board free walking tour and we had an English speaking guide. The guide gave us a detailed introduction of the whole palace. It is highly recommended that you visit the palace early as it got hotter during the late morning and there was no shade.
4071,4.0,"The actual palace can only be observed through a wide opening. One cannot actually enter the palace buildings, one can just walk around them and get an impression how the royalty functioned in ancient times. The Koreans do their best to keep up old traditions and it is fun to see the guards dressed up in traditional attire and to see the Changing of the Guards ceremony. In the area there were many patriotic young Koreans walking around being photographed in traditional costumes that it is possible to rent for a few hours at the Hanok Center nearby. The colorful costumes and the Changing of the Guards make the place more interesting. When we were there it was very hot and there is very little shade. Take big hats/sunshades..."
4072,5.0,This is the number one place to visit for all first timers. Guaranteed you with lots of group tours and people with kids learning about the history. Huge place that takes up to 2 hours for a visit! Get the palace and jongmo shrine pass for easy/quick/best value access!
4073,5.0,"We visited five palace areas in Seoul, and liked them all. Gyeongbokgung palace is huge, and the scenery behind it is beautiful (mountains look gorgeous)! We ended up sitting by the pond with my friends for hours, just chatting and laughing. At one point the park guard had to come tell us to leave, because the park had closed. The atmosphere was very relaxed.  Make sure to get the palace pass which gets you into all the five main palace areas in Seoul. It costs 10,000 won and can be bought at any ticket counter near the entryways."
4074,5.0,A sprawling complex with many buildings. Take the tour. That is so helpful. One thing that we found enchanting was the presence of so many young Korean people dressed in native costumes. It was like stepping into the past.
4075,4.0,"On exiting the metro station, I was approached by a group of Korean youngsters offering tours of the Palace. My guide was a 15 year-old girl speaking perfect English. She was excellent. She refused a tip - said they were not allowed"
4076,4.0,Nice overview place to begin first visit to Seoul from the US. Good review of the history in many languages. Enjoyed the guard change ceremony. Never saw so many selfie sticks used in one place.
4077,5.0,"Fascinating and majestic palace - well restored. I love that it has the mountain range as backdrop, beautiful lakes within the compound and located in downtown modern Seoul. Easily accessible by public transport or taxi. We missed the cultural performance but saw the performer in traditional costumes - very colorful and pretty!"
4078,4.0,"A good interesting day and a real feel for ancient Korean culture, the temples look amazing, can get busy and hot depending on time of year but certainly worth a visit if you are in Seoul."
4079,4.0,The palace was very popular. The palace is kept in good condition and provides a good perspective on life in the palace when it was inhabited.
4080,2.0,"I was so looking forward to seeing this palace but ended up feeling underwhelmed. Compared to palaces in Europe, this palace is very Plain and underwhelming, with lack of displays and information."
4081,5.0,"The palace is situated in middle of the high rises that gives you a sense of the Korean culture and how it has developed over years with skyscrapers on one side and this well preserved Palace in middle.I would suggest to at least take the audio guide but guided tour should be preferred,this helps in providing the context of the history for the palace.Overall this is a highly recommended place to visit in Seoul."
4082,5.0,"Amazing temple. So big. The statues, the main gate. Everything looks beautiful. Really nice historic place."
4083,4.0,"If you're looking for something that will introduce you a little bit of Seoul in Joseon Era, this is it. Quite crowded but guard-changing ceremony is worth-watching. very near two museums and accessible by subway or bus"
4084,5.0,Provides an excellent example of Korean architecture for the period. A wonderful historical experience to see how Joseon royalty lived. Well worth visiting - very unique.
4085,5.0,For only $3 CAD can't go wrong to see a massive palace. It is very large with several buildings to see. You also get free admission to the folk museum. Very nice.
4086,5.0,"Grandious! Historic! Summarizes well the past o S. Korea, a great example of how old meets new in this wonderful city!"
4087,4.0,"The palace is huge. There is museum. You can engage a local guides, he's very good telling you the history of the emperor and the people of Korea."
4088,3.0,"I went to the royal gardens after reading a New York Times feature on Seoul. The tour guide was good, but the heat made paying attention difficult. The gardens were nice, but I felt like I was in a park and not a royal refuge. I'm not sure what I was expecting, perhaps something more extravagant."
4089,3.0,"it was a really nice palace, but not as splendid as i expected for the royal palace. Especially after visiting the other palaces, i need to say that it's not really that different. IT's worth going to the palace, but there is no need visiting more than one. I was done with my tour after 1 hour. I was a little bit disappointed that you could hardly see inside the building. It's very easy to get there by bus and you should also visit the Bukcheon Village close-by. By the way renting a Hanbok (in some shops nearby) costs 10.000 (i think for 1 hour), but in summer it can get really hot wearing that."
4090,3.0,"It covers a large area with lots of buildings that cannot be entered. We did it without a tour as we were too late. So, walking around on our own with scant information did not meet its our expectations."
4091,5.0,Very grand and full of history. The palace grounds are well maintained and the architecture preserved. Weather was great and we had a good stroll and introduction to the grounds!
4092,5.0,Worth the visit. You can watch the changing of the guard and then do the tour of the palace which is 3000 WON per person. Much to see and takes about 2 to 3 hours.
4093,5.0,"I visited this palace many times,still I feel good here It has long history of Joseon dynasty. Plus you can see many people in hanbok,which makes the palace more special. I recommend to visit Gyeongbok palace."
4094,5.0,"Built in 1395-- was the main palace of the Joseon Dynasty. Amazing structure and history. I missed the Changing of the Guards, but wish I had seen it. I went on the free English tour and picked up a brochure with information which added to the experience. The National Folk Museum of Korea is right there and worth visiting as well- no additional admission charged. The museum explains a lot about life for Koreans over time."
4095,5.0,"We didn't go inside the palace, but watched the 20-minute show of the changing of guards. And of course took the chance of photos next to the guards. We could also wear the Hanbok and had photos too, absolutely free. The staff serving us was very nice in helping us to put on the Hanbok and took nice photos for us."
4096,5.0,"Of course, it's the biggest of the five palaces in Seoul and the one with the largest parking area for the Chiniese tour buses. So, if that is your thing, come her. Much better alternative is the smaller, more manageable Changdeok Palace, a km up the road"
4097,5.0,"I've visited three palaces in Seoul and this is my most favorite. It's a big place with many beautiful sites so be prepare to walk. We took our three teenage girls and found so many places to take pictures.  Recently, my girls traveled to Korean and decided to go here at night or at dusk. They ended up taking great shots and it was much cooler in July. Summers are a challenge to go sightseeing in Korea because of the heat and humidity. Visit in the fall or spring if you can."
4098,5.0,"The palace is a good way to start learning about the heritage and culture of korea, it offers tours in different languages including english, chinese and japanese, it also has different museums inside with awesome galleries, some even has an interactive feature, i will definitely come back here! Ps. Make sure to see the changing of guards parade infront of the palace gate!"
4099,5.0,Very interesting place to see and make sure you don't miss this one. We try to wear Hanbok and taking photos too.
4100,3.0,"Definitely a nice to see, but not a palace that will be remembered by us forever. Great architecture and good location, but nothing further."
4101,5.0,This palace is huge and lots of walking on pebble road. There are some stairs to go up to see interior of the palace. It's recommended to wear the comfortable shoes. The guard exchange ceremony is interesting. Taking photos with the guard is a must!!
4102,5.0,"Absolutely beautiful wandering the grounds, watching the changing of the guard. We happened to be there on the hottest day of the year which meant we did not wander as far and as much as we wanted. Be sure to see the Folk Museum there."
4103,5.0,Visited this palace on a very hot day. make sure you take lots of water! There are some shady places to sit but not many. It's a beautiful palace to visit.
4104,3.0,The admission fee is reasonable $3 but my advise to read about the history before you come which will give you sense to what you will see as international tourist. Choose a cloudy day in summer to avoid heat.
4105,4.0,"Great for a morning walk, especially in the gardens. Read up on the history a little before you go to get context. Also try to see the changing of the guards."
4106,5.0,Very nice palace grounds. Tips: Need to pay to go into palace grounds. Changing of guard is free in the front courtyard and so is the palace museum.  Enjoy!
4107,5.0,"sorry man, you cant visit Seoul without visiting this place, its a great place to taste some of the Korean history- the palace where the king himself set and ruled. if you are not that interested in history- still, it is a beautiful palace with great stories to tell. it also have many nice places to sit and have rest with your date or friends."
4108,4.0,This was a beautiful palace but was starting to look a bit run down. It was very spacious and i wish we'd hired a guide to tell us about it as i inagine thete is a fascinating history. Worth visiting.
4109,5.0,The most iconic landmark in seoul. U must go here if going to korea. The entry fee is cheap. Nice for backpacker
4110,5.0,"The Palace is a def must see in Seoul. Although you're not able to visit the inside and it can be extremely hot and crowded, the colorful buildings are beautiful. Don't forget to walk behind the main buildings, but also visit the gardens behind. Used to be the area for the concubines. Peaceful and still with some very pretty sites."
4111,5.0,"Go in the morning and take time to enjoy as it is huge palace and you may want to join the free guided tour provided. Do check the schedule at the Tourist Information Center after the Gwanghwamun Gate.  Catch the ""Changing of Guard"" at 10am and ""Gate Guard Duty"" performance at 11am"
4112,5.0,"I went there with friends but we decided to split in several small groups. I walked around with one friend and it was really calming. But if you go there make sure it's not too hot, I couldn't enjoy it to the fullest because of 37c° and not even a single cloud. You should go there in a Hanbok and take some pics ^-^"
4113,5.0,. Must visit place . located in the city center so you can see how the history met the future . big palace beautyful park check when the gyeongbokgung palace changing of the guards very beautyful ceremony
4114,4.0,I went there just this Monday. Definitely a must-see if you visit Seoul but try not to go here during summer because it's freaking hot here right now.
4115,4.0,"Overall: - worth going to (spend at most 2 hours) - beautiful  Pros: - cheap entrance (around $3 CAD) - huge area for you to explore in - easy walks and lots of photo opportunity - free tours in many languages to learn about the history  Cons: - you cannot enter any of the buildings as they are blocked off - it is only beautiful for the first while because buildings look similar and since you cannot enter them, it might get boring / repetitive - most buildings are not the original (a re-build) so it's not the most interesting for those who are looking for the ""true feeling of emerging in ancient grounds"" - Good to know: the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion (building in the middle of the pond) cannot be entered as it requires reservation in advance"
4116,4.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace has been well-maintained over the centuries that have passed since the end of the rule of the Joseon Dynasty! The attention to detail, with regard to the the patterns on the roofs of the buildings, is flawless.  If you are lucky enough to visit the Palace during the morning or lunch hours, you may be fortunate enough to watch the changing of the Royal Guards ceremony. There are also ample opportunities to take beautiful photos to preserve the memory of your trip.  My reasoning behind the 4-star rating as opposed to 5-stars, is the signage in and around the palace. The number of signs explaining the significance of all the numerous buildings is very limited. For a tourist hotspot, signs written in English and Chinese were few and far between.  This is, however, a symbol of a very important chapter of Korean History and in my opinion, an absolute must-see in Seoul!"
4117,5.0,They have change of the guard at 10am Saturdays Much recommended Blue house is right behind the palace and is beautiful
4118,5.0,"You learn about ancient Korean culture, architecture and history. Having soldiers in costumes also help in describing life in this palace during that time. Very interesting."
4119,5.0,"This place is huge and there is so much going on. Although I didn't get to see it because there was a bad rain storm and it was still raining a little, I still enjoyed walking around this huge place."
4120,5.0,"Royal Lee dynasty is the longest regime in the world history: over 650 years. Every buildings is still under reconstruction as many were burnt down during tough period of the Royal Lee dynasty. There is also a National museum which dusplays Royal Lives of Kings, Queens, Princes & Princesses inside of its territory that is free to all the visitors either local or foreign. May others items which shows its detail of lives in the palace."
4121,3.0,"It's a nice palace, but when compared to the Imperial palace in Beijing, this one seems very small and plain. However, the guard changing ceremony is neat to see."
4122,5.0,"Quiet and calm, worth a walk around the grounds to take in the structure and the landscape. Nice alternative to the busy city streets."
4123,3.0,"It was such a hot month that watching the changing of guards (they have my sympathy) and walking around the huge palace grounds sapped all our energy - even with an umbrella. We perspired so profusely that we decided not to visit every part of the palace. It would definitely be much nicer to visit during the cooler months although not too cold. Having said so much, I would still recommend this place highly for a visit."
4124,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is their primary palace. Tour guides are for free, you just have to wait for their schedules :) They're great, they explain everything in detail. The palace is not yet done for re-construction coz Japanese armies burnt down the whole palace except for the main hall. Will take them decades to rebuild everything. Approximately has 500 buildings inside the palace."
4125,4.0,"The palace area is quite large and nicely decorated. The colour scheme and pattern painted on the buildings reminded me of peacocks and I overheard a tour guide saying this to a tour group. The buildings are quite pretty and there's lots to look at. You can take some really stunning photos with the mountains in the background. It's pretty busy most of the time, but it's such a big place, it doesn't really matter.  We went in the summer at around 10.30am, so it was quite hot and there is nowhere to buy drinks within the palace gates, and only one drink fountain. It would be a good idea to bring your own water/drinks and a hat/umbrella to protect from the sun.  Of course, the highlight of the visit is witnessing the guard changing ceremony and taking a selfie with the unnaturally still guards afterwards. It really is something to see. You don't have to be there at 10am to see it, there are smaller ones occurring at each hour as well.  Visiting this palace can also be incorporated with a trip to Bukchon Hanok village, the other nearby palace and then Insadong. They are within reasonable walking distance of each other and makes enough to see for a whole day."
4126,5.0,set in a very peaceful park setting great architectural with a mirrored lake you certainly will need your camera has a controlled walk to view all aspects of the Palace
4127,4.0,"Experience the guards changing ceremony at 2pm. Go early like 11am, end of the palace there is a museum. You will need at least 1 hour inside to explore. Interesting place to go. Come out to the main gate of palace by 1.50pm get ready for more. summer time get ready your umbrella."
4128,5.0,"It's really huge palace, as far as I remember, it took about 1hour to go from entrance to blue house behind the palace, absolutely walking slowly, hearing some explanation from tour guide, though. So during summer, you may need sunblock or umbrella! Anyway buildings are so beautiful and it become real with history in mind. I can tell anybody ' don't miss this palace '"
4129,5.0,"Beautiful central palace. We visited it once in winter, when it was really cold. We will visit it again for sure. It is very well maintained. Most of holidays the entrance is free. Otherwise the prices is around a couple of dollars."
4130,4.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is definitely worth a trip if you are prepared! It is quite large and gets very hot in the summer months. Comfortable shoes, water bottles, and sun hats are a must. We were lucky enough to catch the changing of the guard, which included a small parade of fresh guards and drummer. We had to buy a ticket to go up and into the upper section of the palace entrance, to be honest, there was not much English around to explain things. Definitely read up on the history of the Palace, maps are available on site. The farther you go into the Palace the more beautiful and lush the surroundings become. We also ventured into the Korean Folk museum on the property, a welcome retreat from the heat and chance to grab a cold drink. At the very end of the property, just outside and behind the palace, The Blue House is located. It is the executive office and official residence of the South Korean head of state, the President of the Republic of Korea. Outside the palace back gate is a wonderful photo opportunity if you have interest in The Blue House. We took the path down between the Palace and The Blue House and came to large intersection which had a beautiful fountain and free museum across the street."
4131,4.0,"If you're someone who enjoys watching historical dramas (like me hehe), then you will definitely love this palace. However if you're not, fret not. This palace's sights will still take your breath away by it's magnificent architecture, and not to mention how amazing your photos will turn out.  Be sure to catch the royal guards changing ceremony, and try not to miss it as they only have certain timings for it. To add on, it is quite interesting to see how they can manage to play instruments and/or march in sync in those long uniforms of theirs. You can also take pictures with the guards that are standing at the entrance of the palace (if you're lucky, they might even smile for your pictures!)."
4132,4.0,This palace is amazing but the Secret Garden tour is well worth it! It's very inexpensive and the docent is extremely knowledgeable! It was super hot out (August) but the shade offered along the path makes it bearable.
4133,5.0,It's very cheap to access and very quiet and reflective. I liken it to a smaller version of The Forbidden City.
4134,5.0,Perfect place to walk around and discover the Korean culture. Don't miss the Korean couples dressed in traditional clothing.
4135,5.0,"This vast area would give you a good understanding of Korean culture. The colorful parade showcasing the different traditional costumes of their soldiers in the olden time. While the palace is good, the only thing that disappoints me is the buildings built around the palace that for me is an eye sore. Other than that, everything is perfect. :-)"
4136,5.0,The palace is very beautiful with mountains as the background. We also get to see the changing of the palace guard ceremony at 10:00 am. Very interesting! It was like returning to the past
4137,5.0,"Def a must while in Seoul. Very beautiful and huge!! You can spend hours wandering around. You get to see lots of buildings and gardens. A few times per day there's a guards change (check website) - recommend! Get an English tour (it's free, btw, and only 1 hour) - there are few per day. And the National Folk Museum of Korea is within! Also nice and not too big."
4138,5.0,"I went as the palace was in the centre of Seoul - I had already visited the Secret Garden and C'bok Palace earlier in the trip - so didn't expect to be overwhelmed in comparison. To be honest - I think this was my favourite Palace in Seoul. Firstly the scale is immense when one considers it is slap bang in the middle of the city. secondly - when you are expecting to just wander through labyrinths of palace buildings, you stumble across beautiful gardens and pools of water - the gardens themselves are extensive and astonishingly pretty. I found it very peaceful and a refugee from the Seoul summer heat. I would advise any visitor to take themselves off for a visit and at Won 3,000 for an entry ticket, it was incredibly cheap compared to the prices to visit palaces and castles at home in the UK."
4139,4.0,"If you are in Seoul, you have to go there. This place is amazing. It's HUGE so be ready to walk. The gardens are breath taking. Very beautiful and peaceful.  Can get really HOT in summer, so bring water, sunglasses or a cap.  I learned a lot about Korean History just by visiting this place. I highly recommend it."
4140,4.0,"This palace have about 15-16 pavilion (i forget about the sum exactly 😆)..... From the gate...if you get the right timing, you can see the little ceremony of guard changing... After passing the gate, prepare your energy to walked around the palace. You also can visit the blue house (just in front the gate) and the museum (free) around there."
4141,4.0,"Not much signage so, I would recommend taking a tour. Be sure not to go in the heat of the day. There is little shade and the summer heat was brutal."
4142,5.0,Much to explore and one of the great many places to understand the history and culture of Korea. It is good to note the different time slots for the guided tours to help plan your trip. There is a 3pm English tour.
4143,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace was my second favorite palace in the city. Its so huge that you really don't have to go visit any of the other palaces as they are all extremely similar. I probably spent around 2.5 hours walking around and admiring the beautiful architecture and natural areas located within the palace grounds. There was a free show performed by the locals as I entered the palace gate, which was quite interesting to watch as they were demonstrating a scene from the past. The National Folk Museum of Korea is located on the same grounds, which was a nice pit stop along the way. I'll keep my review short by saying that it was worth the visit as the palace is rich in culture and history and it's so big that you can get the full palace experience!"
4144,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is a great place to see houses of royal family members and to know something about their history and lifestyle. It has a huge beautiful territory, it took us about 2 hours to walk through the palace. It also includes admission free museum and a small cafe/restaurant. There are ceremonies for the Opening and Closing of Palace Gates and Guard Changes. Several times a day there are free guided tours in Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese. Tip: it may be hard to walk through all territory in hot sunny day, better take an umbrella and at least one bottle of water."
4145,4.0,"Love the free tour, great presentation, nice and expansive gardens on site. Also has traditional concert at night during the summer months. Usually closed on Tuesdays."
4146,5.0,"Mighty structures from Joseon dynasty. The palace area is really huge and will take time to cover. So must go there with time in hand & it is definitely worthy. Big palaces. signature designs, and so organized. The whole area is highly well maintained. Souvenir shop and food is available inside. The Museum will brief the amazing past of the royals.  This place very near from Changdeokgung Palace and can be visited together. Walking would be the best way from one place to another."
4147,5.0,"Mosth popular place in seoul, the grand palace. You can learn about the history of korean people. In the morning, there is also change guard ceremony."
4148,3.0,"We all know if you are in Seoul you will end up there, to make best use of your time 1- Go with a free tour, English tours are scarce but sure its better than walking by yourself, check the time in their website 2- Watch guard changing, the time is about 13:00 ish I guess Enjoy"
4149,5.0,We went there 9 am and no cue so going in for a visit different palaces and building inside. The museum was nice . It show part of the history of Korean dynasty. Soldiers exchange was 11 am in main entrance.
4150,5.0,Get there at least 10 minutes before the times to see the changing of the guards. We liked this Palace the most.
4151,5.0,Beautiful architecture and peaceful gardens offer some respite from the madness of Seoul's traffic. Lovely to see so many school children in traditional dress- hanbok.
4152,4.0,"The Gyeongbokgung palace is definitely worth a look if you are visiting Seoul. Set at the north end of the city against a mountain backdrop, Gyeongbokgung is actually one of three Joseon dynasty palaces that formed a palatial precinct before it was systematically broken up during the Japanese occupation in the early 1900s. Much of it has now been restored or rebuilt. The original throne hall survived the destruction and is a relatively open building so you can usually see inside, even if the palace is crowded. There are some beautiful gardens and quiet courtyards that I found I had to myself despite visiting in the middle of Summer break. There is also a guard in traditional dress at the main south gate. It routinely changes with great ceremony during the day and the accompanying narrative is interesting. You can see most of Gyeongbokgung in about 3 hours but if you have more time, wander a little further and see the nearby palaces of the Queen and Crown Prince."
4153,3.0,This palace was massive!!! It goes on and on and on and you have to walk a lot. I suggest getting a tour guide when you go here otherwise you won't know what the several palace buildings are and what's going on. Go at night preferably as the place is lit up.
4154,5.0,"Old palace, historic site, well serviced for travelers! It is a little bit hot to visit during the day time in summer."
4155,5.0,"Also called the North Palace, this is a beautiful palace, where the guard changing ceremony is a must-see."
4156,5.0,"Very nice, in particular in spring, guard change real fun for children. Well maintained and interesting to roam around."
4157,5.0,"It's a lovely palace and very expansive. For photographers, it is an excellent venue both day and night. I can't remember how much the ticket was, but probably around $2 usd."
4158,4.0,This palace is a must visit place in Seoul. Recently it is open for public at night for a certain period of time. I enjoyed the night tour. There is a museum beside this which is also a good place to visit. I recommend to search the website and go there when night tour is open... Late afternoon would be good time to visit.
4159,5.0,this palace is one of most interesting places in the world as you can enjoy the feeling of the ancient times and the joy of seeing the amazing costumes of the Korean people. you must see the changing guard cermony.
4160,4.0,Enjoyed the walk we did through the amazing gardens and old buildings. Very peaceful setting and interesting part of Korean history. Seoul is a very busy city and this land mark is nice break from all the hustle and bustle
4161,5.0,Try to go on weekdays. Crowds can be fierce on weekends. Korean grandmothers are often quite pushy in queues -- no news to Koreas but surprising to westerners.
4162,5.0,"Accessible, with tourists even the cold season, it helps you realize the history of Seoul and South Korea."
4163,5.0,This palace is one of the most amazing places I've visited. The mixture of the great architecture together with its surroundings was just something out of this world.
4164,5.0,"The place was huge. The whole are is wonderful. It's better to come with a guide so you can hear the history, but there's signs everywhere with the story of each section of the beautiful palace."
4165,4.0,It was a great way to look at Korea's past and looking at the way Koreans lived in the past especially the royal Koreans and how the architecture of the palace.
4166,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is the historical of korean, this place is so many people but when we walk to hidden garden, I'm feel peacefully and relax."
4167,5.0,"An extremely interesting place to learn about Korean history, culture and architecture. Quite big so ideally need 2+ hours to see it all, especially if you take the time to stop and photograph each area."
4168,4.0,"I visited the palace once in 2015 during day and once in July 2016 at night. I have to say, the first time I saw the architecture of the buildings I was impressed. The second time around was not as impressive. I would recommend the palace to first time visitors to get a better feel for Korean style buildings. If I go back to Korea, the palace will not be on my list to do."
4169,5.0,"It's a miracle this place still exists, considering the unthinkable brutality and genocide Korea had to suffer through during the Japanese colonization. Besides witnessing the pagoda's and old palace's you will come to learn why Koreans take such pride in their heritage. I enjoyed learning about how the Kings used to walk in figure 8, symbolizing wealth since you could afford to feed yourself lavishly. Go check it ou."
4170,4.0,"One of the places to see for a historic tour in Seoul, Korea. It is a big palace and has nice gardens. You could take a stroll and feel at peace. It is worth going and seeing"
4171,4.0,"This is an ancient palace in the middle of very modern city. The site has been restored quite heavily but remains very interesting. there are two museums on site, we visited one of them the museum of Korean Life. A great little museum."
4172,5.0,It was a really big palace. Highly recommend you to go if you haven't been there. It is a place that I think one must go in Seoul.
4173,5.0,"Much larger than you would expect, so come with adequate time to enjoy yourself. Walking through the gardens was particularly enjoyable."
4174,5.0,Is a great cultural site. You can spent a lot of time in the Palace. Good place for the family to visit.
4175,5.0,A interesting place to visit. If you like old places full of history this is a must go in Seoul. I liked it!
4176,3.0,"Unfortunately, there was a lot of tourists visiting gyeongbokgung and it's quite difficult to take a nice picture with all of these people as the background."
4177,4.0,"Great place to know more about the culture and history. Appreciated the tour guide's stories, but if you want to soak in the entire place, be ready to spend half a day, at least."
4178,5.0,Really great place except for the fact that it was reaaaalllyyy hot cos it was summertime. MASSIVE place. Guided tours were available but I didn't think the English would be comprehensible so decided to stick it out on my own. Overall good eye opener to their culture.
4179,4.0,"It was a really big castle and I have the chance to watch the garde parade, it was a unique show we can only see there I think. It is a really touristic place but a must see in Seoul !"
4180,5.0,"This is a must-see if you go to Seoul, especially to understand something of Korea's cultural history. The palace is actually a huge complex of buildings square in the midst of downtown Seoul's business district, so it's accessible by car, bus, or metro. Parking is at a premium,however, so use public transport if at all possible. Be advised that this tour requires lots of walking due to the size of the complex, numerous buildings & gardens, etc. If you're there in summer, except it to be HOT, so be prepared. An umbrella is a good idea, both in case of rain & for shade if it doesn't rain. The buildings are serene & beautiful outside & surprisingly plain inside. On our visit there were numerous Koea-American, Koean-Canadian,& Korean-Australian young women there in full traditional dress, which is beautiful & adds to the charm of the place. It's kind of a pilgrimage for them, apparently. Don't miss the excellent museum adjacent to the complex. Nice & cool in there, & the exhibits are interesting & help you understand what you're seeing outside. (I suggest doing the museum first, then the complex.) The restaurant adjacent to the museum offers a limited Korean cuisine. If that doesn't appeal to you, there are numerous food outlets in the near downtown area, but that will involve more walking. You should allow at least 3 hours to tour the museum & palace complex, more if you intend to stop for a meal. But this is a great place to visit, highly recommended."
4181,5.0,"A very nice experience, also accessable with a stroller (once you manage the metro). The guards with their plastic toys look funny at its best (artificial would probably be a better description). If you are there, try to make use of the free app provided (free wifi everywhere) or the english guided tour. The adjoint folk museum is interesting and provides aircondition to cool down during high season."
4182,5.0,"Small but beautiful palace! Cheap and easy to go by subway with a direct access to the Palace. The moment we left, there was a ritual ceremony at the gate, it was beautiful, a must visit place."
4183,5.0,"Great place to take your time and walk around the palace grounds. If you can time it just right, watch the ceremonial changing of the guard first. This will last about 15 minutes and then you should explore the grounds."
4184,5.0,This is the best palace (of the 3) in Seoul. Strongly recommend to take the free language tour (check times on their website) or book one with Seoul walking tours (free as well)...w/o someone to explain the deep history / lifestyle its just a bunch of building. The guard changing ceremony is okay nothing special.
4185,5.0,"This formed part of a private tour we'd organised, so we didn't need to buy tickets or think on timings... we simply were guided, informed and enjoyed.  The changing of the Royal guard was stunning and brilliantly translated over tannoy :-)  Our guide explained many many interesting facts about the architecture, history, residents and traditions relating to both the palace, residencies and grounds.  In the grounds is also the National Folk Museum... Well worth visiting with its excellent exhibitions and Korean history timeline board... please stop to read it, rather than just walk past, or you'll miss out on knowing so much!!  There is also a children's museum, so all ages catered for."
4186,5.0,It was my first time to be there and it is a really a comfortable place to walk around and get to know about the history of Korea. Highly recommend you to go if you haven't been there. It is a place that I think one must go in Seoul.
4187,3.0,"The first time i went to Gyeongbukgung Palace it was raining. But even if it's raining, you can still explore the palace with umbrella and don't be afraid because the ground won't be slippery, the ground designed with rough sands and rough steppingstones deliberately so that people can't walk fast in dynasty era."
4188,4.0,Very nice if the weather is good. Lovely surroundings and plenty to look at. Good for all types of travellers to see Korean history.
4189,3.0,"No visit to Seoul would be complete without seeing the most important palace in the country. Expect huge crowds during the summer. We had a private guide and learned about how the rulers lived, etc. Easy to access as its right in the middle of town."
4190,5.0,"A brilliant set of palaces and gardens. Really essential if you're in Seoul, the complex is well preserved and full of Korean old skool flava. You can wonder and wander for hours through the gardens. With a little bit of effort you can escape the crowds and find some serenity."
4191,4.0,This is the largest palace of all Seoul. Too big and hot on summer days. If you would like to see a very big palace with great expansion this is it. If you would like a more manageable place with more trees and vegetation I would recommend going to the Changdeokgung palace.
4192,5.0,I wish I had more time to spend here by myself. My 80 yr old mother and I visited here and she couldn't walk the grounds all day. (suggestion - provide benches for people to sit). We were lucky to be there at the change of guards in the morning. It is only 3000 won (about $3 US). Not a bad picture to be taken. Our hotel was in the area and personally I think the best time to visit is early morning and late at night (the gates are closed but it is less crowded and lit up at night)
4193,5.0,"It was the first monument we visited while travelling in Korea. It was gorgeous from the beginning to the end.  We took the subway to get there and we appeared inside the palace. Fantastic!  The entrance fee is very cheap and you can walk all over the huge palace. With this fee it is also included a visit in the National Museum, inside the palace area.  A great visit to do in Korea, watching the contrast of the traditional buildings and the brand new ones coexisting in the same city."
4194,4.0,The grandest of palaces in Seoul. I arrived when they were doing a traditional guard ceremony demonstration which was great to watch. Not much to see there but nice to wander around the buildings.
4195,4.0,"There are tour groups available, but we decided to take our time to stroll around ourselves. The pavilion in the pond is a must see, and walk deeper in to find secluded/ less crowded parts of the palace it truly is beautiful. And you can't leave without watching the changing of guards march. I don't know how they stand so still even through the Korean winds (brrr....)"
4196,5.0,"It let you know more about the old days in Korea. Spacious palace with beautiful pool and garden. If you wear the Korean Traditional clothing, the entrance fee is free."
4197,4.0,Very beautiful place. Palace grounds are huge therefore allocate at least 2 hours when visiting. My favourite part of the palace is the Hwangwonjeong or the pavilion in the middle of a pond and Jibokjae which is the library/cafe on the far end. I recommend people to buy the combination tickets to save money.
4198,5.0,i had the opportunity to go on a night tour of this palace with a Korean friend and i can highly recommend it. the lighting of the structures and the overall atmosphere was something special.
4199,5.0,"We walked the whole are of Gyeongbukgung. There is a small forest trail right at the end, overlooking a beautiful and serene lotus pond. Entrance to the folk museum inside the palace is free and is a good visit."
4200,4.0,Worth a visit. The grounds are huge so be prepared to walk and bring a map. We did not have a tour guide. It's a fantastic place to take photos.
4201,4.0,"Really enjoyed wondering around the palace grounds. My family split up and agreed to meet back after 2 hours. Even still, my son (15 y.o.) said it wasn't enough time and he had to rush back shortly after discovering another area. Very beautiful place."
4202,2.0,It was nice but the only reason for me to go back there would be to exercise since its got huge grounds.  A lot of the buildings were renovated (basically all of them)so there was no feeling of deeper history.
4203,5.0,"I went with a group of people in a bus, Tour guide was Korean lady fluent in English. After arriving there was too much walk and talk, we were not allowed to enter some places so we only sneak peek from outside"
4204,4.0,Very interesting place to visit and great area to walk around after the visit. A must when we visit seoul
4205,5.0,We got a chance to visit the Korean palace. Plan on staying at least 2 hours. It is one of the best places in the city to take your family and to take pictures. It is pretty inspiring. We were lucky to have a guide explain the whole place. It is well worth the investment.
4206,4.0,There is a lot of history to be seen and learned of at this palace. I would highly recommend it for those visiting Korea who want to learn more about the country's rich history.
4207,5.0,My wife and my son enjoyed our visit here. The place is quite crowded when we were there.  Architecture was superb and magnificent.  A place that should not be missed when visiting Seoul.
4208,4.0,"This place is very beautiful in autumn. Its close to the city, easy to use public transportation. Free entrance fee if you wear traditional Hanbok."
4209,5.0,If you visit Seoul then you must visit this palace! It is a very vast assortment of old buildings and gardens so be prepared for a hike! Some of the visitors are as interesting as the buildings! The juxtaposition of old against modern is striking.
4210,5.0,I have visited the Palace a few times with my South Korean students. There is so much history there! It is amazing and all South Koreans know a lot about it.
4211,5.0,"Personally, I prefer Changdeok palace than Kyungbok palace, eventhough both of them are really beautiful korean royal palace, Kyungbok palace was distroyed by japanese people during 18-19c when japan colonized korea.  Anyway, It was really nice to travel this place with my german friend. We can get in the palace for free(even my german friend), cuz it was a cultural day! (It's the last Wed of every month). Usually, it cost around 3$. I recommend to make a reservation for the pavilion in the palace, You can make a reservation for that free through the internet website and it's free. It was the best expirence for me and my friend to go inside of the pavilion called 경회루 where used to held big party during the summertime. And of course, Most of the buildings in the palace was really good and they has free museums, one is korean palace museum, and another one is a korean folk museum."
4212,5.0,An Amazing place. A little gem nestled between the skyscraper of Seoul. Excellent value for money especially when one buys the combination ticket for all the palaces even if one only visits a few as I did.
4213,4.0,"This is our second visit to the palace but our first time at night, it is very different from the day view, it feels very mysterious and the entrance looks so magnificent across the road. It's a good place to learn about korea's history and culture if you join the guided tours."
4214,5.0,"It is truly THE palace to visit and marvel at the beauty presented to you! For an adult you only pay 3000 won and get an overwhelming display of the past. Although, yes, there are a lot of tourists, but considering the size of the place you don't mind them. Wandering around the grounds there will be many couples and singles in hanbok taking a lot of pictures. It is a nice addition to the whole experience. I suggest to go there when it opens so you have some quiet moments there as well!!"
4215,4.0,"This is my 2nd time to Gyeongbukgung and the palace has never failed to impress me with its palace structure and scenery.  Arrive around 10:30am before the changing guards ceremony at 11am. The entrance fee is 3,000 won per adult and if you want free entrance, wear a hanbok.  The changing guard ceremony takes about 30 minutes and you can consider having lunch at Insadong as it's merely 5 - 10 minutes walk from Gyeongbukgong."
4216,5.0,"Excellent palace, worth the 3000 Won ticket. I visited this on Saturday and many young Koreans were dressed in the national customs and happy to have their photos taken. The gardens also good to visit and good photography opportunities of Seoul skyline."
4217,4.0,"This was the first Korean palace we visited - it is a 5-minute walk from the Gwanghwamun subway stop. The admission fee is minimal ($3.00 I believe), which is appropriate. It was hot as blazes - be sure to dress for heat and bring an umbrella - not for rain - but for shade! You can look in to the palace, but visitors are not allowed inside - you have to peer-in. The palaces are interesting, though after you see one or two, they begin to look very much the same. I would recommend choosing two to visit and then move on to something else."
4218,5.0,"A grand palace with impressive architecture. The palace ground is large and the trees give it a cool ambience. You can visit the museum, the traditional house and take lots of pictures."
4219,5.0,Gyeongbokgung Palace did not disappoint. There was a lot to admire and the size of the palace grounds was very impressive. There is also a shop within the grounds which had beautiful handicrafts and served amazing drinks.
4220,5.0,"With a beautiful backdrop of green mountains, the palace is an exquisitely restored (and partially reconstructed) monument. It's history, with successive destructions and recontructions, speaks to the resilience of the Korean people and is a testament to their coming of age as a unified people. The grounds offer a serene walk through compound after compound of simple and delicate architecture, decorated internally with vivid colors and patterns. I also highly recommend the museum!"
4221,4.0,"While this is definitely nowhere as pretty or interesting as similar places in China and Japan, it's still a nice place and you should definitely visit as part of your trip to Seoul. Its a cultural attraction and it's important to learn about the history of the country"
4222,5.0,"I visited Gyeongbokgung with a group of friends, it was beautiful weather in March, so I thought it would be very busy....but because the palace grounds are so expansive, even with a lot of visitors it is still quite serene and easy to find some peace and quiet. We didn't visit the museum that is within the grounds, but there was still plenty to fill in a number of hours. I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Seoul. It's easily accessible and breathtakingly lovely."
4223,3.0,"It is one of the only realy cultural things you can do if you ask me so you have to visit it. But i wasnt that impressed, all the buildings looked the same. The pound is nice though."
4224,5.0,very interesting palace of the kings + queens changing of the guards in full ceremonial clothes colourful site .
4225,4.0,"Mostly watched from outside, we were very impressed changing of the guard ceremony accompanied by a military-style drumming, Especially exemplary order and discipline."
4226,5.0,"Such a nice place. Im so into historical sites so this is definitely my most favourite attraction in Seoul. The lake inside the palace looks serene and the breeze is so refreshing esp when you visit in summer. Be prepared to do a lot of walking and photos. Before Gyeongbokgung, I went to several palaces. The buildings kinda look the same. Only this palace has more things to see like the lake, the pavilion, the folk museum. They have the combination ticket ( 10000won for 5 palaces or so) but nvm if you dont have enough time to take a look at all 5 as i think gyeongbokgung is enough! In case you wanna have a nice photoshoot with hanbok, probably visit other palaces. They are not as crowded as this place so people will not ruin your perfect photos."
4227,5.0,Very reasonable costs and regular changing of the guard. The gardens were good with lots of seating in the shade. Great views of the mountains
4228,4.0,Rich in culture. Magnificent view. We could see many koreans (and non koreans) wearing traditional korean clothing. Informative and helpful guide. Guide was available at certain timings and in different languages. This is the most famous out of the other palaces.
4229,5.0,This is a great attraction and you can get a free guide that will make the tour much more enjoyable.
4230,5.0,"This was a wonderful visit as it somewhat shows you how the Korean people used to live and you can imagine what day to day life was like back in those times. It takes you out of the city even though you are literally in the center. A must-visit when in Seoul. Do be aware, it can get very crowded during busy times."
4231,3.0,"I went there with my family and we only walked into the front yard. We did not enter to the palace because we think there isn't much to see and they are not as nice as the Summer Palace in Beijing. However, if you are interested in these kind of places, you got to visit this Palace."
4232,3.0,A good place to relax and enjoy the nature. Come to see how the korean royal lived in the past and the architect of korean palace. A place should visit when come to Seoul
4233,5.0,"I was walking down Samcheong-dong and found the entrance to the palace and decided to go in. It was pouring rain that day and really should've gone into the National Folk Museum but I wanted to see this palace and it would be closed the following day. The people were still there despite the rain! This palace was huge with so many grounds and so many buildings, I kept walking and walking and walking. I have to find my pics because my favorite area was this small lake with a small wooden octagon shaped building on an island in the middle. It was so beautiful and since I did not join a tour, unsure fully the history of it or what the purpose was. But, thought that would be a lovely place to go relax in if I had lived in that palace!"
4234,5.0,"very beautiful palace, interesting historical building, nice to visit around spring.we came just in time for guard changing ceremony."
4235,5.0,"Huge, beautiful, grand, cheap to visit, very korean experience, next to metro, can spend 1.5-3 hours."
4236,5.0,I enjoyed visiting the palace complex. It is worthwhile to time your visit to coincide with the changing of the guards. The re-enactment added a great depth to the tour.
4237,4.0,"The day we went it was sweltering, humid and hot...so it took away from the experience a bit but the Palace is truly awesome in it's size and beauty. It was a popular destination for groups of girls and young women to take shots of themselves in their full hanbok (traditional Korean dress) But they do have a small coffee shop where one can at least get a cool refreshing beverage. Lots of green space which is missing at most of the temples that sport the same beautiful architecture."
4238,4.0,"We especially enjoyed the architecture and the changing of the guard ceremony. When we visited (on a Sunday), there were so many people, that the photos we took were not as nice as the ones already posted. If we were to visit again, we would visit on a weekday when it most likely will be less crowded. If you benefited from this rating, please click the helpful button."
4239,5.0,This beautiful palace was a beautiful trip through history The English speaking tour guide was great. We learned a lot and enjoyed our experience.
4240,5.0,"Good architecture of past korean building, there is free guide for every hour that will explained the for every building in this palace, in english."
4241,5.0,This place and the changing of the guard is not to be missed. Choose a good sunny day to visit this spot. Feel the pulse of past korean History
4242,5.0,"The English tour is a must! the guide was so passionate about the topic and so informative. The palace its self is very breathtaking and has copious amounts of history behind it, a must when in Seoul!"
4243,4.0,"Travelling to Seoul will never be complete without visiting this grandest palace. Going to Gyeongbokgung Palace is really very educative and enriching, indeed an eye opener to Korean culture especially in their way of life and government in the past.Every nook and corner of it is rich in history and breathtaking. However, be prepared to wear comfy shoes as you are expected to climb steep stairs."
4244,4.0,"The costumes are real, the place have a fresh paint job, a lot of history in the place. We went for an afternoon visit and was worth the walk. Everything is new and fresh. We were able to watch the changing of the guard which was colourful and energetic. Many tourists wearing traditional costumes added to the place and the realism. Go for a visit."
4245,3.0,"It should be for free because nothing special there except the guards ceremony ,but you can walk along to city stars surrounded by great buildings and ..."
4246,4.0,"This is a Main Palace at Seoul area. Very Big area, with many rooms and variety usefulness. We should go arround this palace for minimum 1-2 hour. Take Picture in several Big Building."
4247,4.0,"We entered the palace through, I think, the Southern Gate and watched the changing of the guard ceremony. The grounds initially are pretty stark, though once we walked close to and past the palace, the grounds were filled with colorful flowers, gardens, trees and life. Worth seeing!"
4248,3.0,There are quite many people visiting this palace as it is the largest one in the area. Some of the buildings have furniture in them so you can see from the door how the people used to live. I personally preferred the Changdeokgung palace as it has more trees and flowers in the palace area and is more peaceful. But why not visit both?
4249,3.0,"What started as a hot and humid June day while we were visiting the palace, turned into a monster storm in no time that stranded us midway round this palace. After some 40 minutes of solid rain, we extricated ourselves at the expense of wading through deep puddles as we swung around the various buildings of historical interest. Be careful crossing the courtyards between buildings as we found the stone paths quite slippery on our way out. Viewing was restricted from outside looking in to dark halls and rooms, so it was a shame not to really be able to embrace everything our enthusiastic Korean guide was telling us about the palace history. Bound to be better on a dry day there."
4250,4.0,The highlight of the visit was the flag changing ceremony with the soldiers wearing traditional Korean dress. The surrounding and palace is beautiful with lot of historically important details. It will take around 1 hour to see the palace fully...
4251,4.0,It is a very beautiful place to visit. A must see in Seoul. Near the public transport. Multi language tours several times per day.
4252,3.0,"Most of the palace is packed with tour groups, but luckily it seems the tours only see certain parts of the palace. I was able to find a beautiful area where I was completely alone, and it was very peaceful to sit and think, or just admire the architecture."
4253,4.0,A good place to visit at any time. Shop and cafe available. Interesting displays inside and attractive walks outside.
4254,3.0,"For what this is advertised to be, I must be honest and say I left feeling quite underwhelmed.  Let's get one thing clear: The palace grounds are beautiful. No denying that. But as I was looking for a more informative destination, this wasn't the place for me.  Sure, there are english tours, but few and far between. And there is an app that provides an audio guide, but the initial app had me downloading another app, which then asked me to download another service, at which point I gave up.  I personally found the Korean Folk museum on the other end of the palace MUCH more interesting and informative (and it's free).  And even for nature folk: Changdeokgung Palace seems to be the better option than this."
4255,5.0,Very beautiful place & lots of place to take picture. But it closed at 6pm.  Ticket fee for adult 3000/person  Very recommended for tourist when visit seoul
4256,5.0,"I was informed that there are 5 most famous palaces in Korea and Gyeongbukgong Palace is one of them. Located in the middle of Seoul, it is definitely easily reachable by the subway. The entrance fee was really cheap and you can enter for free if you wear the Korean's traditional clothes called Hanbok. It was definitely worth a visit to the palace."
4257,5.0,Went to Gyeongbokgung Palace the very first day of my trip. It is very beautiful and large cultural spot. There are a lot of nice places in the Palace to photograph. Really liked walking in Gyeongbokgung.
4258,5.0,"Everyone says that because it's true. Go for the long version and get there early enough to get a front-row stance. The music, the pageant, the colorful uniforms are a real visual and auditory treat. The rest of the palace is very interesting and clean, neat and tidy. I have visited way too many Asian palaces, shrines, temples and Buddhas and so I can't be trusted to do it justice."
4259,4.0,We visited the place at the end of May and it was a little hot and sunny but it was a beautiful place to visit and take photos. You see young girls and guys dressed in hanbok taking photos around the palace which adds a nice touch to the place and the gift shop is also a nice place to visit but it could be a little on the expensive side.
4260,4.0,"This is our very first place to visit in Seoul. It was really nice to walk around in the palace and there were also other museums nearby the palace such as the Children Museum.  Free admission fro the Children Museum.Children can watch the Korean animation of the folklore story of Moon and Sun.This is one of the museums located inside the Gyeongbokgung Palace.But you have to pay for the entrance fees at Gyeongbokgung, the rest of the museums inside are with free admission."
4261,4.0,Gyeongbokgung Palace is a nice and big enough cultural area to explore and photographed. Rent 24 hours package of hanbok and wear it when u come to this palace. It is placed in one area with Bukchon Village and only few steps away in front of Insa-dong market.
4262,4.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace was the first place we went to. If you're a tourist, this is definitely a must go. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that the K-drama ""Princess Hours"" was shot at the Gyeongbokgung Palace. You'll see the ""changing of guards""."
4263,5.0,"This old palace and the gates are very impressive (built late 1300s) and it is absolutely amazing that the admission is only about $1USD. The palace grounds are quite extensive, so you can easily spend a few hours here if you want to see it all, or just a short time if you only want to walk through the gates and up to the palace. I recommend good walking shoes as the paving stones are a bit uneven in places, and bring water and a hat, as the grounds are quite open with lots of sun."
4264,5.0,"If you are a huge fan of Korean historical drama, there's no better place than this one where you can enjoy every little details about Korea's past. Try rent a Hanbok, a traditional costume, so you can enter the palace for free! Guide book and audio guide are available for purchase and rent. Free guide tour is also available."
4265,5.0,"It is really amazing place. Very cheap too (only 3.000 won and you get a free tour of 1:30h). The place is huge so wear confortable clothes and shoes. If you are coming in a sunny day do not forget to wear sunscreen and caps because except for the gardens, there are not much shadow or trees to hide from the sun. You will probably spend more than 2 hours walking. You can also rent an audio tour if you do not want to wait for the next free tour. Beautiful buildings and story of Joseun Dinasty."
4266,5.0,This is the first Royal palace built in the Joeson Dynasty 500 years ago. The is largest of the five grand palaces remaining in Seoul. It provides a glimpse into Joeson's Royal culture and architecture. Great place to go back in time and know Korean history and how they evolved over the years to a modern county while deeply rooted with their traditions too. You can take pics with girls dressed in traditional Korean dresses too. Best time to visit is around 4pm as after you can enjoy the evening in Gwanghwamun Square. Admission is 3000 won.
4267,5.0,Large palace to explore. Very nice to walk around and admire the structures and the ground. You can spend hours here.
4268,5.0,"Make sure you have time, It takes about a two hours to see the whole thing. It is worth it though! Must go. Go to the museum prior to your entrance too!"
4269,3.0,Gyeongbokgung palace it is good tourists attraction in Seoul because it is the largest palace built by Jason dynasty. The royal family who ruled Korea kingdom in 1392. I don't recommend to stay long time because the heat of summers. The best activities is the ceremony of change the guard who wears historic dressed.
4270,5.0,"We went on the last Wednesday of the month which was designated as a culture day, so the entrance to the palace was free. We grabbed a guidebook for KRW500 from the ticket counter as soon as we entered. There're various pavilions, halls and gates in this huge palace compound, so plan your route and time accordingly so that you can maximize the time.  We managed to view the Hyangwonjeong Pavilion with its reflection in the pond. However, this reflection disappeared over time. If you wish to snap a picture with the reflection, it is best to head to this pavilion as soon as you enter the palace ground early in the morning. Do check out the schedule of the changing of the guard ceremony. This is a must watch if you've not watched it in Deoksugung.  The paint of the the buildings looks new and well maintained. Exploring this huge area brings you back to a different era. It is rich in history so it'll be good to do some reading before visiting. The landscape should offer different kinds of beauty in different seasons.  Spend at least half a day because there are 2 museums here. If you plan to tour a little more in depth, you might need a full day. We did not visit the museums since we continued our visit to Cheongwadae (Blue House) in the afternoon."
4271,5.0,"It must be have a lot of history here. So large, amazing and hot weather this month. But its amazing to come here. See a king palace. See some girl and boy use a traditional korean clothes. Good, must visit place in seoul"
4272,5.0,"Although each palace has unique features this was by far my favorite palace in Seoul. The architecture is wonderful and being able to see the Blue House was neat. It will take a long time to explore, so make sure to take your time."
4273,5.0,"The place is so extensive. When you step foot on the grounds, it immediately transports you to a different era. The area is full of ancient looking buildings and a lots of history and stories embedded in the architecture. The highlight for me was the beautiful pond within the vicinity which was covered in lotus plants! There is also a free museum within the compound which apart from its historical value, also is fully air conditioned and comes with a cafe. A great place to take breather."
4274,5.0,I highly recommend booking a hanbok rental around the area (about 25-30usd for whole day) before coming here and entrance will be free. I believe they provide tours but I went on my own so I could take my time. This is a great palace to come if you have time to spare. I had a wonderful time and my pictures looked lovely with the palace back ground.
4275,5.0,gyeongbokbong Palace is a nice place to have a day long excursion. You can easily access it by subway. There are many great restaurants nearby. The kids will enjoy this place!
4276,5.0,You have to arrive about 15 minutes before 10 am to get a good place to see the changing of the guards. It is worth the shirt wait before entering tha grounds which are nicely kept. The place was rebuilt in the 90's so it does not have the same character as the other palaces. The gardens are worth the visit with great opportunities for photos with the family.
4277,4.0,Visited the palace and it is a nice area to walk around and see the korean style buildings and parks. Relaxing enviroment in the middle of a buzy city.
4278,4.0,A fine display of Korean history. Huge complex of ancient relics preserved nicely. Two relevant museums are there just next to it. But the facility is not wheel chair friendly.
4279,5.0,"To truly appreciate the Korean people and their history a visit to the Gyeonbokgung Palace is essential. It is a huge site easily accessible by the Seoul Metro. There is a very nominal entry fee equivalent to about $3 that goes towards restoration and upkeep. Seniors are free. There is a free English guided tour that commences at 10 am and well is worth it. The palace is really a group of several separate residences and gives a feel for life in the Chosun Dynasty. Many sections have been restored and it lacks the opulence of other palaces, but does depict the reality of life in a bygone era, at very beautiful location in Seoul."
4280,4.0,"I personally prefer visiting other palaces as Gyeongbokgung can get very crowded and very touristy.  Huge area, free tour guide available (u can make reservation frm their official website). Spare at least 2-3hr if u wanna cover all areas thoroughly.  ChangingGuard ceremony musnt be missed.  Hanbok rental available just in front of the palace entrance. Wearing hanbok lets u enter palaces (this one n others) for FREE ! :-)"
4281,4.0,This place is huge and you must expect to spend 4 to 5 hours appreciating the historical significance of the place. Take your time and walk leisurely at your own pace. There are English speaking guides available if you want a fast pace around the area. There are many restrooms available.
4282,4.0,One of the must visit place when you are in Seoul. In this place you will learn the korean culture. Never miss the Guards changing ceremony when you visit.
4283,4.0,"rainy gloomy day which took away the colours of the photos, but not the grandeur of the place. Majestic and pretty, it was really a fulfilling of real life witnessing of drama scenes. Joined the free guided tour and it was an informative 1.5hours. IMHO, better changdeokgung"
4284,5.0,"This tour is absolutely nice !!! We loved everything, especially the greated tour options. Thanks for all of your good suggestions. I also appreciate your guiding me as I really appreciate Seoul and Korean culture so much now! Thank you for everything."
4285,4.0,"There are few exhibits but the size, grandeur and history is apparent over the extensive grounds. The buildings are a mix of old and many authentic reconstructions, as apparently Japanese colonial occupiers burnt them down several times of the millenia. Definitely worth a visit and English-speaking yours are free."
4286,5.0,"This is my favorite site in Seoul. It is the largest palace and grounds, with many buildings. 1. Do watch the changing of the guards at the front gate. It happens in the entry courtyard so you don't need to buy tickets to see it. They say it is done hourly, but I read elsewhere they do larger ""shows"" at 10 am and 2pm. We saw the 10am and it was very cool. They explain things in Korean, so we missed some of what was going on. However they did have some explanations in English. I could understand how they checked the new guards credentials, handed over the keys, etc. 2. Do the tour. Most of the buildings do not have furniture, so you are mostly looking at the outside and seeing the interiors from the outside. The tour really added to understanding the palace, it's history, how it was used and its significance to the Korean people. It is only 1 hour long, and worth it. Plus, it's free! English tours at 11am 1:30 and 3:30. 3 I recommend getting there for the 10am changing of the guards and then doing the 11 tour. It is likely to be a bit cooler and maybe less crowded. 4. At the back of the grounds are the buildings where Queen Min was murdered by Japanese assassins in 1895. These buildings are not brightly colored like the others and I could feel the sadness King Gojung must have felt. 5. Also at the back you can catch a glimpse of the Blue House compound, the home of Korea's President."
4287,5.0,"Visually, this is an overwhelming experience because of the sheer size and variety of structures and landscapes. Some of them make for some of the best photo ops in Asia. There are also museums on the ground. But what I think is most rewarding -- and important -- is the history that you can learn and the perspective you can gain. As an American who has lived in Asia since 2004, I find the ignorance of my fellow countrymen about the world -- especially Asia -- to be embarrassing. The story of this place takes you through the history of Asia from a Korean perspective: subject first to China, then the various brutal invasions by Japan. Koreans feel an enormous sense of pride in their culture and their strength. As a tiny country surrounded by giants, you really appreciate both when you visit here. Take your time when you come."
4288,4.0,"A nice place to visit, large open area with historical architect and palaces, don't miss the guards shift change at the front gate.. I think its in each one or two hours.."
4289,3.0,"I was almost expecting a life changing experience because of all the ratings. It was ok. We saw the changing of the guards and walked inside the palace... Meh. It looked like many of the other palaces we've seen in Korea. If this was there first one we had seen, maybe I would be more enthused.  We also walked into the museum and ate at the cafe. The food was great and reasonably priced."
4290,3.0,This is a popular destination especially on weekends. Would try and go on a weekday to avoid larger crowds or early morning. There is English guided tour at 11am which usually attracts a crowd but is worth it to get an overview of the highlights. There's a peaceful tea shop in the back corner behind the lake. Also the museum cafe has nice teas and deserts and a nice ambience. Changing of the guard at 1pm and larger performance at 2pm but don't disrupt your day for this. The folk museum has lots to see but is s bit repetitious after visiting the national museum. Metro drops you right at the front on the orange line. Seniors over 65 are free.
4291,4.0,"Loved all the people in traditional dress & watching the changing of the guard. Maybe the gardens are beautiful in spring, but not so well attended in June. Does anyone pick the apricots?."
4292,5.0,If You Got Koren Land already; You Must To Go This Place For Pray To The King Of Korea for Pray for Good ucky In korea Alive !
4293,5.0,One of the important places in Seoul must be visited .. too much big and too much beautiful .. you feel there you are one of the old Korean people .. full of history .. I like it and want to visit again
4294,5.0,A very beautiful and big palace. We spent one whole morning walking around the palace and taking photographs. We were not able to cover the whole area. There is also a museum there but we did not go in. We also saw the guards changing ceremony. This place can be reach by taking the subway to Angguk.
4295,3.0,Its a nice and big palace. Needs time to visit. Completely korean culture show. ok-ok place. Enviourment is Nice
4296,4.0,"Go early so you will enjoy the guided tour in a smaller group. The place would get crowded at a later time. Spend at least 3 hours or up to half a day there to tour around the palace, the National Museum (near the palace entry) and also the Folk Museum inside the palace. Consider getting an integrated ticket for foreigners at krw10,000 to access other palaces and Jongmyo Shrine as well, which certainly save u some entry fee if you are planning to visit most of them."
4297,5.0,This is a beautiful palace which you must visit at least once when in Seoul. Do watch out for the guard changing ceremonies and free guided tours. Worth the trip to understand the history of the palace. Palace is also very near to Bukchon Village area and the famous Tosokchon chicken soup restaurant (same station). Must visit.
4298,5.0,"We are in Seoul for a conference but whenever we travel we love to do museums/palaces/temples. This was wonderful - calm, beautiful, historic. It seemingly goes on forever but definitely as a respite in the chaos of city life in Seoul!"
4299,5.0,Live in person. Its stands at the end of the square over looking all this modern Seoul and its a site that cannot be missed. I went with a guide and he told me more details I wouldn't have known otherwise. Just watch out for the busloads of tourists who don't care that you would like a picture with the giant drum too.
4300,5.0,Make sure to get a tour guide to take you through this amazing Palace. You get so much more out of exploring this sprawling complex with someone giving you context. The changing of the guard is colorful and filled with drums and music. Very cool.
4301,4.0,"It was easy to get to by metro to gyeongbokgung station, and was a pretty good place to spend an hour or two. It's actually really big and I'm not sure if we managed to see the whole place as we weren't given any maps, but the buildings were pretty repetitive after a while. It's probably a good idea to go in hanbok (that you can rent in lots of shops in the area) so you get in for free (although it's pretty cheap anyways), and take cool photos. We went during midday in summer so that wasn't really an option, but in milder weather I definitely would have done that."
4302,5.0,"Great to check out the changing of Guards before entering the palace. Entrance fees are very economical at 3000 won for adult. If the main palace is too crowded , it would also be interesting to move to the side palaces or gardens. You could witness the kitchen where servants cook or royals have their meals. Gardens and lakes are so beautiful. The entrance fees also entitle you to enter the folks museum which is worth a trip as well ! Overall, we spent about 3 very enjoyable hours here just strolling on the grounds. Highly recommended !"
4303,5.0,"Beautiful palace of the Emperor, there's a free guide that will take you around in 2 different times of the day, very interesting!"
4304,5.0,"Enjoyable visited to Gyeongbokgung Palace, one of famous tourist spot to go if you are planning to going to Seoul."
4305,4.0,Nice Heritage Site. The Changing of the Guard Ceremony is worth a trip. Watching the young Koreans in their traditional clothing (they can enter for free if they are dressed traditionally) was interesting.
4306,5.0,This palace reminded me of The Moon Embraces The Sun! The water is so calm that the reflection of the palace looks stunning in the water! I like that the back gate is accessible to the Blue House.
4307,4.0,"Very easy to find from several metro stations, and at only £/$ a ticket it's incredible value for money.  You can also get a small guide book for pennies which is a good help as you walk around.  Can easily spend a few hours there or blast around in an hour without stopping in the museums (Palace museum being the more interesting and informative).  Only real criticism (and not the Koreans fault really) but as it was torn down by the Japanese during the occupation, it's only been recently restored (started in 2001) and so there's a lot of concrete in places where there would not have been hundreds of years ago.  However, despite this, beautiful gardens and a worthwhile way to spend a morning/afternoon!"
4308,3.0,"This is a huge palace, and worth a visit. But it is very popular by many tourists, so be prepared for a crowd."
4309,5.0,"is is excellent that middle in a modern city, suddenly you reach a part of tradition in best condition . when ever you have a travel to Seoul, donot miss this place"
4310,3.0,"I'm not a big palace visitor, I need to be dragged along most of the time, but Gyeongbokgung is really worth a visit, and if it's just to take a stroll in its vast gardens at the back. Many people take the free tour, we opted to just read what was in the brochure and on the signs. A lot of Koreans visit this site dressed in costumes of the era, which makes it a really more authentic and colorful experience.  Worth taking a morning or afternoon of your time in Seoul to explore."
4311,5.0,"Beautiful palace, a must-see in Seoul! You can rent a traditional hanbok near the entrance, which many tourists do to take pictures."
4312,5.0,The palace is a very well organized and it is close to the museum. We can visit the real Korean's traditional performance there.
4313,5.0,"I visited four palaces in Seoul and this was the best one to visit. It was the largest one and our guide was friendly and very good in explaining things. The great thing about the palaces in Seoul is that they have tours in Korean, Mandarin, English and Japanese. If you go early, you can watch the changing of the guard ceremony and even take pictures with them. In addition to the palace, the National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum of Korea are conveniently close and free (you can't beat that!). Even the Blue House where the President of South Korea lives is within walking distance but I didn't go there. The Gyeongbokgung subway station is by the palace but it's also within walking distance from Anguk and Gwanghwamun Stations."
4314,5.0,It's big so be ready to walk. You can tell the palace was renovated...probably due to the war. But still very beautiful and serene. It's a MUST SEE if you're in Seoul!
4315,5.0,"My family and I highly enjoyed this palace. My 9 year old son thought it was very fun and educational, and we all enjoyed the attached museum. It had beautiful grounds and we learned a lot!"
4316,4.0,You could spend all day here but we took about 2hrs to scroll through. We took lots of pics and listened in to a couple tours but we didn't take one. It cost less than $3 to enter per adult. Not good for a rainy day as everything is outside but you can see inside through windows and doors.
4317,5.0,"had a wonderful 4-5 hours here and joined the free English Speaking Guided Tour. Our guide was great, good clear diction, a sense of humour and history information which was important. Tour can be booked inside Main Wall and is free for Seniors"
4318,4.0,ive been a fan of korean drama but seeing the palaces brings happiness to me. though not a magnificent as i previously pictured in my brain but it is so spacious. the pavilions were intricately designed. how i wish i lived in those kind of era. Nice seeing tourists wearing national costumes and have their photos taken
4319,4.0,I visited this place on May at 1PM and it was very hot outside. You can take picture with the palace guard but please be careful not to disturb or touch him or they could be mad. This palace consists of many buildings inside. Make sure your feet are ok and your stomach is full before coming here bacuse this palace is soo biiigg. I got very tired eventhough i were not explore all of the buildings inside.
4320,3.0,A little disappointing as we expected majestic architecture and beautiful gardens since it was the touted as the most beautiful of all the 5 palaces. We gave the other palaces a miss because of this reason. It took us less than an hour to view the grounds that were opened to public. The guards at the front entrance were however very obliging so we have some good memorable shots.
4321,5.0,"As seen in the korean movies: nice place to visit, to see korean culture and tradition. A lot of korean pines around."
4322,5.0,You can't go to Seoul without taking in the historic atmosphere with relaxed strolls around Seoul's Palaces!
4323,5.0,Wonderful day not a fan of guided tours but this is a place that needs to be explained a must see 'Holiday Tours and Travel Korea' run an excellent tour and thanks to David for his guidance
4324,4.0,"Come see the guard change, stay to walk around the palace. We had a hard time finding a tour but it was good for a quick (< 1 hour) visit."
4325,5.0,"I had just a couple of hours at the end of a business trip and ended up here by serendipity. For a mere $1 above the price of the $3 basic entry to Changdeokgung Palace, it combined a lovely walk in the park, the historically interesting palace and the beautiful wildflower garden. I did not have time to explore the palace closely or to even enter the Great Greenhouse so I hope I get a chance to go back."
4326,3.0,"An interesting recreation of the palace. It would have been better if more of the original structure still existed. As it stands, it is still a decent place to visit. You can sometimes see traditional costumes and ceremonies."
4327,4.0,Not much to say since we didnt go into the Details. Nice place to take some photos. Everything was clean and the place itself was worth seing.
4328,5.0,get there early. Seniors are free! lovely grounds and palaces are beautiful. MUst see the colorful changing of guards. YOu are allowed to take pics with the guards at the front gate .
4329,4.0,"Interesting attraction, with a lots of locals visiting the place, wearing the traditional clothings. The place was huge and need to walk quite abit. Beautiful place to take photos with the flowers in the background."
4330,5.0,"The palaces, quarters, ponds and gardens are beautiful. And it's interesting to learn the parallel historical timelines. While the Renaissance started in Florence, Italy in 1350, Gyeongbokgung Palace was built in 1395 during the Joseon Dynasty."
4331,5.0,Beautiful site and visit! We took the english tour. We loved our visit. Take all the time necessary to do a complete visit of the site and the gardens and as well make sure not to miss the changing of the guard show. We took such beautiful pictures and made memories we will forever cherish. A must see during your visit to Seoul!
4332,4.0,"We liked it quite much. Beautiful place, worth the visit. It closes at 5pm we were there at 4pm, still enough time to wander around :)"
4333,5.0,"We stumbled upon the palace while wandering around Seoul. It was a great experience, we got to see a traditional Korean performance and wander around the grounds. We saw a lot of museum static displays and a ton of art."
4334,5.0,"Just check the time of free guided tours and guard changing ceremonies before you reach the palace. With the guided tour it was quite lovely. View is nice, the palaces are similar to Chinese architecture but a bit different as they are based on Confucius' teachings."
4335,5.0,"I highly recommend a visit in this palace and join the tour with your language.  Our tour guide was truly wonderful because she was able to explain to us well about the history of every corners of the palace, her sense of humor was a bonus because we never had a boring moment especially talking about history.  A fantastic experience with the tour."
4336,5.0,Nice palace to walk around on a sunny day. Just by the blue house. Take your time and just wander and then check out the neighborhoods nearby for cool trinkets
4337,5.0,We were fortunate to arrive just before the changing of the guard so there were no crowds. It was avery colourful event and fun to watch as it was also fairly short.
4338,4.0,"visited this palace during our recent trip to seoul. we watched the change of guards ceremony which is scheduled on every hour. after which, we had fun wearing the general / commander / guards costumes for photo taking etc - this is FOC. all these activities are at the outer court only. if you want to visit the inner court, you need to pay the entrance fees."
4339,5.0,"Truly a wonderful place, it was a step back in Korea's past but I would advise you to visit early as you will encounter thousands of local school trips."
4340,5.0,Palace is really well maintained... had a nice lovely walk through the palace. Caught the guard exchange ceremony which should not be missed.
4341,4.0,We. I sited the palace in Dec 2015 and again in June 2016. Our June trip was with an English speaking tour guide which made a huge impact on our enjoyment of the tour.
4342,5.0,Enjoyed watching the historical changing of the guard and the fastidious work that has gone into developing the Palace.
4343,4.0,The Koreans have worked hard to rebuild this culturally significant complex of buildings after the destruction of the 20th Century. Its a kind of forbidden city on a smaller scale.
4344,5.0,"The free show showcasing the ancient guard changing ceremony is worth visiting. It is near the Metro station, we strolled by another 150m near this palace for the Gingsen Chicken Rice."
4345,4.0,"Don't know if they are always there, or if it was a special occasion, but the palace grounds were crawling with locals dressed in traditional Korean attire. It made visiting each house on the grounds more authentic. The grounds are massive, so give yourself a few hours, and there is a political museum on site that we barely peaked at since we arrived to close to closing time. Take your camera!"
4346,5.0,"Once a complex of 500 buildings destroyed by the Japanese, and though not as large as the Forbidden City in Beijing, Gyeongbokgung reconstructed still manages to awe visitors. It is full of Koreans and tourists in traditional Korean Hanbok dress (free entry!).  Be sure to come for the Changing of the Guard ceremony at 1000 hrs and 1400 hrs because even the guards are in ancient costume. There are other ceremonial performances, the times of which can be found at the Visit Korea website.  There are free tours in different languages, and two museums attached to the palace complex. We went for a tour in English (only 3 a day) and it was most informative and helpful. Our guide explained the underfloor heating, the tiered Queen's garden and showed us where Japanese assassins murdered Empress Myeongseong in 1895 and burned her body. I was quite shocked to learn of this barbaric act. But that's the thing about this palace - it immerses you in Korean history.  Write in for permission in advance if you want to visit the banquet pavillion, which is otherwise closed to visitors."
4347,5.0,"Start off your trip in Seoul with a visit to this palace. While it was summer for locals, weather was still pretty good for us. Reco to rent Hanboks (traditional Korean wear) so that you'll have free entrance to this place."
4348,5.0,"We could have spent a lot more time here, especially with the Folk Museum attached. The weather for us during our visit was very hot, so we looked around and took pictures and appreciated the beautiful buildings."
4349,4.0,Visiting the palace as part of an organised tour and quite enjoyed it. To fully take in the place suggest 2-4 hours.
4350,5.0,"Very accessible and near a city station, The palace is a great place to immerse yourself in Korean culture and architecture. :)"
4351,5.0,"One of the few major monuments open on a Monday, which coincided with my first day in town. It is a relatively large site, with extensive gardens as you move through. Exit on the north end to catch great views of the presidential complex and you can soak in the government district on your walk back to the metro."
4352,5.0,"I took a subway to this palace and the train system in Seoul is very convenient as the instruction and announcement is in English, Mandarin and Korean. Even the ticket vending machine is on 3 languages so it's pretty easy to get around and you won't get lost. Ok I really enjoyed the beautiful scenery at Gyeongbakgung but it was freezing cold in Dec. There are English and Mandarin guided tour around the palace at certain time. It's pretty interesting to learn about the culture and some ancient beliefs. For people who can't tolerate with extremely cold weather, I would advise you not to visit the palace during winter. Strong wind and the cold could dampen your spirit to walk and explore further 😉"
4353,4.0,"Before we went to the palace, we found out that if you wear the traditional costumes you will be able to enter for free so we rented our Hanbok from a nearby shop. The rental fee was about 30,000 won and we can return to them by 5pm. What a fun experience wearing Hanbok and walking around the palace and taking photographs. The palace was a really beautiful place and I am sure it will be better if you follow the guided tour. It is quite a big place and can get quite crowded from early morning to afternoon so be sure to go eariler and please put on sunblock and bring your umbrella along, most part of the pathway are not sheltered. Keep in mind that there is only 1 cafe inside the palace so you may want to bring some food and drinks along while walking around."
4354,4.0,"The buildings are nicely maintained. The place is spacious with trees around. A lot of chairs for people to take a rest when visiting. Yet the side gate bear Gyeongbokgung Station does not allow exit so we have to walk back all the way the the front gate to get to that area, which is a bit inconvenient."
4355,4.0,"Large Temple set in the center of Seoul, small fee to enter, is somewhat accessible for people with physical disabilities"
4356,4.0,"Beautiful, historic palace and grounds in the middle of the city. I was surprised at just how big the property is. Plan on spending at least a few hours"
4357,5.0,"Nice Walk, and photogenic! Be sure you go with a guide, so you will receive very important information."
4358,5.0,"The visit at night is very different from day time. There's no guided tour and no guards-changing ceremony at night but it gives you a feeling of tranquility. Besides some buildings being lit, there was also a play with various lighting effects and musicians playing live music. We spent nearly 2 hours there.  The place opens at night on dates 29/4-1/6, 16/7-19/8, 24/9-28/10 and between 7 and 10pm.  The 3,000 won entrance fee would be waived if you go in traditional Korean clothes.  We loved the locker facility provided. We left our bags in the lockers available on the left hand side right after passing the admission gate and traveled the palace light. The 100 won coin deposited would be returned to you when you open the locker."
4359,5.0,"We loved this place, it's amazing! Tips: Go to this in morning, could have many beautiful pictures. There are many people wearing hanbook, you can take many shoot with them."
4360,5.0,"Very interesting and beautiful palace. Near the ""Blue House""--residence of the current president. English tours are available."
4361,5.0,Very very very good. I like the historical castle. It's very huge. If you're lucky you can catch some wonderful and remarkable festivals.
4362,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is one place you have to visit when holidaying in Seoul. It is wonderful to see a historic place in the middle of the city. Getting there is easy too. We took the train there on our own and the palace is within a minute's walk.  You can catch the change of guards ceremony at a few timings during the day and you can dress up in beautiful traditional Korean costumes to take nice photo shots too. There are guided tours available at certain timings and I recommend you follow the tour if you want to learn and understand more about the place. As I walked and explored the palace on my own, I missed out alot of stories behind the many halls in the palace."
4363,4.0,The Gyeongbokgung Palace is conveniently located in central Seoul - just down the main road from City Hall. Its a beautiful palace and worth visiting!
4364,4.0,Make sure you wear comfortable shoes when you will visit this palace. Its really wide spread and you will need to walk quiet a bit to see everything. Please keep at least a few hours in hand to see everything. There are a few guided tours available that you tickets for.
4365,4.0,Great place to visit when in Seoul. Hard to think that this can be found in the city with sky scrappers on one side and and mountains in the back ground on the other side. Not very big and can probably only want to spend an hour there but definitely worth a visit.
4366,4.0,I enjoy visiting the palaces. I was fortunate enough to visit on Memorial day and had the opportunity to see a lot of young coup les in traditional dress.
4367,3.0,Huge palace lots of crowds and girls in national dress all having their photos taken little information provided but some hints of history in the queens death at the hands of the japanese. Many of the bildings the same but the large hall and thrown immpressive.
4368,5.0,"Magnificent place, lots of history in this place. Recommend to get the free guide to walk around. Having the understanding will make the trip more meaningful"
4369,5.0,Recommend going for changing of the guard and then doing a guided tour. The grounds are really big so allow a couple of hours and bring a lot of water.
4370,3.0,just skip it if u are not into palace. it required entrance fee but you can easily sneak in during peak hours. for me just taking a photo at the entrance of the palace is more than enough of my time.
4371,4.0,"Well maintained building. Entry ticket is 3000Won per person. During certain hours, you can see the changing guard ceremony. Can reach here by subway using the Gyeongbukgung station which will bring you out near the National Palace Musuem."
4372,4.0,Gyeongbokgung Palace is huge historical beauty. Nice place to go around for pics. U can time urself for free guide available in English as well. Even without Guide its worth a tour. Give min 2 to 2 1/2 hr for complete tour of palace. Its in heart of city and easily accessd by subway.
4373,5.0,Very interesting palace dating from 1392. Beautiful buildings and very well maintained. We had a free guide.
4374,4.0,Huge place to visit. Allow for at least 1.5 hours to go through the whole place. the library was a nice place to stop for a cup of tea as well.
4375,4.0,"Being a Palace it shows the grandness of the royalty of the past with the touch of frugality. The structure has signs of Chinese architectural influence. From Gyeongbokgung Palace, you are a short walk to Insa-dong.where you can experience artique art, book stores and craft shops."
4376,4.0,"A stop at the palace is well worth the cost of admission, as is the audio guide. Budget about one to 1.5 hours here, and enjoy wandering through.  There are not many shaded areas, so if you come during the hot months, plan your stop for the morning or for the last entries of the day, otherwise it can be tiring."
4377,4.0,Great tour that you can do on your own or with a guide. You can easily spend a half day just touring the grounds. Be sure to visit the guest room in the Blue House. Very good history lesson.
4378,4.0,Well-maintained palace where the highlight for us was the 10am changing of the guard which our kids were enthralled with.
4379,4.0,Visiting the palace is a great way of partly knowing the history of Korean dynasties. It is easily accessible and few minutes walk from the train station. I took advantage of the free tour guide services being offered by students. Their desk can be found just before you get out of the train station.
4380,4.0,"The place can be extremely crowded during weekends where you have to squeeze to get around. Outside of the main palace it is still pretty quiet where you can sit and truly enjoy the beauty of the palace.  If you want to understand the palace, a tour is a must as there arent many informations shown in the booklets."
4381,4.0,"If you are someone who loves history, this place is worth visiting. Otherwise, going there is also worth the trip if you are looking for places to take pictures with buildings on the yesteryears."
4382,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is good for those who are interested in the history.Those going to this place must visit Insadong market (very near,just outside the palace) , known as ""Art Street"" of Seoul."
4383,4.0,"The palace was interesting to walk around and take in, and gave a good amount of information about the lives of the past royal family, even without the free guided tour. Easy enough to spend at least a couple of hours here as the grounds are huge and the various buildings spread out. The highlight for me was one of the pavilions in the centre of a moat which was incredibly picturesque and peaceful, against the backdrop of mountains. The only problem was it was very very busy, but likely due to it being a great value, essential attraction for visitors o Seoul."
4384,4.0,"A very good place to spend a weekend morning, looking the beautiful palaces and gardens, with good oportunities to take a lot of beautiful shots.."
4385,5.0,"We went twice. It was too hot in the day. But in the evening it was beautiful. Even more so due to the large number of people wearing traditional clothes. A limited number of evening tickets are made available for foreigners each day and only become available at 7:00 in the evening, so head there at 7:00 and grab some evening tickets! We were lucky enough to go on a Saturday and a great show was on from 8:00. This was my favourite event in Seoul. It is also definitely worth catching the changing of the guard ceremony. Watch from inside the main gate."
4386,5.0,Just a beautiful palace where you can sit down and appreciate the history and architecture at the same time. Definitely worth a visit!
4387,5.0,Spent hours here with my mother and grandmother.  There are many different types of traditional Korean palaces you can visit along with a museum that houses old Korean artifacts.  Take your time her and go at your own pace. That's the beauty of this site.  Don't forget to visit the section on the east that have models of an old school Korean village.  Admission was free when I went but I think there is a fee normally.
4388,5.0,been here for 2nd time and still impressed with the size of the place and its historical stories. Found out more history from local guide and every little detail in these buildings holds a lot of interesting meaning. Would suggest to get local guide to bring you around in private tour to understand and explore more about Korean culture and historical infos.
4389,5.0,Anyone who is interested in the countries history must visit this place and escape from the noise streets of the city
4390,4.0,This palace was interesting not only for it's historical value but because it was also in the middle of the city. You could literally take a picture of the palace with Seoul's myriad skyscrapers as a backdrop. Reminded us of some of the palaces in China.
4391,5.0,"it was very nice to see gyeongbokgung ceremonial on that autumn, they have a beautiful view and huge building"
4392,4.0,ensuring the traditional palace is maintained is good that too in the middle of the city. At one end you see the palace and the opposite side you see all the modern sky scrapers. good visit
4393,5.0,"You can spend 2-3 hours here pretty easily. Take a leisurely stroll, and check out all the buildings within the palace ground. You can also get access to the National Folk Museum as well from here with the same ticket."
4394,5.0,the place is too big to walk around.. lots of big and small palace plus ancient stuff.. the palaces were amazing! ancient korea!
4395,5.0,"This palace has been completely restored to its original, even though it has been destructed twice in the Japanese attacks on Seoul. It is of great beauty and should not be missed!"
4396,5.0,Easily one of the prettiest sights of Seoul with the mountains as the backdrop. On a Saturday evening I saw many Hanbok wearing local girls which gave traditional feel. The palace reminds me of the forbidden palace in Beijing. With large and nested courtyards. There is an entrance fee to this place and the ticket counter closes at 5 PM. Easy to get to on the metro. There are many nice places to visit after a tour around the palace.
4397,3.0,"It was a hot sunny day n there was a guard changing shift ceremony when we arrived at the Palace's main gate (b4 entrance). Some tourists made the effort to rent hanbok n wearing it to the palace to have photos, which was really nice. There is a Pavillion on the waters which tourists can reserve 1 day in advance (pic attached) to get access to go in n have photos. There r certain guided slots which r in different languages acc to the ticket counters."
4398,4.0,"A grand and big palace. Lots of walking but worth it. Don't miss the changing guard ceremony and check their new schedules before visiting. Now, they only have two shows at 10:00 and 12:00. They have a big show running when we visited there. Because it was their Golden week in the first week of May, free entrance for all visitors to all palaces on that weekend. Also, if anyone wearing their traditional Korean clothes, free entrance are granted. After visiting the palace, you can take this opportunity and enjoy their famous Ginseng chicken soup. That most famous restaurant is 10 minutes away from the palace, but don't go there during lunch hour, you will find at least 200 people waiting before you. We wait until 3pm, no waiting is required."
4399,4.0,"one of the palace in Seoul, we purchase royal palace ticket which we can use it for different palace, however the palace was really crowded, and little bit dusty, u can find museum at the back of the palace, well we did not stay long...."
4400,5.0,"Visiting this primary palace when visiting Seoul is a must. Take the guided tour given at 11:00, 1:30 & 3:00 to get the most of your visit."
4401,3.0,"It is a beautiful palace and nice to go for a walk. However, in terms of architecture and beauty, there are other places in the same region that may be more beautiful. It was nice to see guard changing ceremony in the front of the building."
4402,5.0,It is a worth place for the price.  We got the 10000 won tickets to visit the 4 palace and the garden. This palace was the only one with free show. There's 3 kind of so you should check the time.  For us it was at 13h to 13h30.
4403,5.0,This historical Palace is worth the trip. It's so huge and splendid. It's a must to visit the palace when going to Korea.
4404,5.0,"Historical place and it is spectacular. Free tour guide provided and there is performance in the middle of palace. The palace is connected to the front area of Cheong Wa Dae. Love the view so much. There is a museum with the coffee counter, you may get a rest here with free wifi. It is worth to spend 2-3 hours here and then go to eat ginseng chicken soup after this."
4405,5.0,This palace is so large that you feel like you will never be able to see it all. The buildings are beautiful and very well maintained. It is amazing how extensive the complex is and the different buildings you see throughout the grounds. We highly recommend visiting this palace if you are coming to Seoul.
4406,3.0,"The Korean palaces are really really simple and peaceful. Beautiful gardens and halls, but nothing too ornate. Should visit at least one of the palaces if you are in Seoul"
4407,5.0,It was fantastic to visit this palace. It is made out of wood mostly and amazing how it is not damaged after 100s of years. We did not go inside the main part which needs ticket but we're able to see a lot in free ticket zone.
4408,4.0,"Nice place to visit in Seoul. for people from Europe this is a relatively young historical place, but for US and other citizens - it is old enough to be amazing. in very good condition, full of young people, nice and calm place in the middle of a 10 million-citizens town. great architecture"
4409,4.0,It was pretty much a muchnes although changing of the guard really good. Inside was sparse and for me just ok. The museum however far more interesting as it depicted life to the present
4410,3.0,Since traveled a lot in Asia i wasnt blown off my feet. but it is a nice place to visit. spend there 2 hours MAX
4411,5.0,"A most interesting location. I was impressed with Korea's maintaining their history, yet at the same time, staying up to date in their new architecture. Place it on top of your places to visit."
4412,5.0,This palace is massive. We were lucky enough to be here on a day that featured a Korean song and dance group. It felt as though we went back 200 years.
4413,3.0,The Gyeongbokgung Palace is an interesting place to visit especially if you are interested in Korean history and the way of life of royalty during that era. I cannot say that I could identify with much of what I saw as it was not an area of the world that I know very much about and so did not appreciate a lot of what I was seeing and was being told about.
4414,3.0,"Visit this place if you've been to Changdeokgung Palace and only if you've no other place to visit.  Changdeokgung is far more beautiful of a palace than Gyeongbokgung. However, Gyeongbokgung has it's charmed as well. Visit during children day and you'll get free entrance for a day"
4415,4.0,Marvelous palace in the heart of Seoul.The changing of the guard ceremony is interesting and it was lovely to see young people in their traditional dress.
4416,5.0,"This is a must visit while you're in Seoul. I would say this is one of the major highlights when visiting. You have to pay a small entrance fee of 2,000-3,000 won (roughly about 2-3 dollars US) and once you get in, you are free to roam around. Theres actually a lot of areas to explore in the Palace. Gardens, pond, areas of hanoks and temples.  It can get pretty busy and might be difficult to take pictures, so I recommend going early morning. You can also wear hanboks and walk around the Palace as well. Theres also an art gallery close by (outside the palace gates) with lots of traditional Korean restaurants, cafes, shops, etc."
4417,5.0,"Its huge!!!!! i needed more tan 3 hours to do the Speedy gonzalez style tour, (walk fast, few pictures and keep going), dont miss it, just try to go early morning and weekends to avoid large groups and school trips groups"
4418,5.0,"Interesting enough to spend time to visit. My sister & I rent Hanbok for 4 hours (cost less than 15,000 won/person) and had free entrance tickets. Changing the guard parade is really interesting. I considered we were lucky to see the march!"
4419,4.0,"Having a day tour around Seoul, this palace is the first and maybe the most important place to visit. A big complex of palace that reminds me of Forbidden City in Beijing, not only show the richness and uniqueness of Korean architecture and history in the past but also offered the visitors with some attractions from Korean kingdom (which unfortunately I did not have enough time to enjoy)."
4420,5.0,A great day to spend the day. The museum is worth visiting and the have free performance to enjoy and the comfort of A/C. Stroll around the grounds and enjoy!
4421,4.0,We had an opportunity to watch the ceremony before leaving. The place is quite big and we only stayed for only a few minutes since it was winter and we went there on our last day. But it is definitely a place to visit when going to South Korea.
4422,3.0,This place is very nice. The palace is very spacious. You can imagine walking along the path where kings and queens have and marvelling at the gardens and scenery.  When you have bought your ticket for the palace you can go to the National Folk Museum for free when you show your ticket on the same day.
4423,4.0,A good place to visit to learn about the history of Korea. There's a guard changing at 1pm and u can take photos with the guards. There is also a museum nearby to understand more about korea's history
4424,4.0,"This largest palace in Seoul (or Korea?) is conserved extremely well, though the narrative signs can be a bit more lively and in-depth. I visited on a Saturday morning and the place saw huge crowds - tourists, kid groups and girls wearing Hanbok!"
4425,3.0,"Nice walk, plenty of photo ops. Servant quarters are cool. A lot of people come dressed in costume. Only 3,000 W."
4426,5.0,"Like all the other palaces i have visited during this travel , you can feel the history of this nice country the architecture is splendid . Don""t forget to borrow the local national dress from the reception and walk around wearing it , you will feel like you are one of the soldiers or guard of the palace . All facilities are also in , like coffee shops , toilets , museum ... . it is really a nice place to visit in Seoul ."
4427,3.0,"Beautiful Palace architecture but then stripped of all its goods and wealth,.. feel bad about colonial rule which korea also suffered.. and the damage that Japan did to the history of this clean, strong economy ....  This country needs to get back its history by collecting all its artifacts from various collectors and restore its history ... because with out ones heritage one cant build his future...  Well kept and simple... building ... well feel it less only because I am comparing it with the Palaces of India...but its different here...."
4428,5.0,"Located in the northern part of Seoul city, this palace has many beautiful buildings and nicely landscape garden. Ideal place to make many photos. If you are visiting Seoul, It's better to combine the visit to Palace with other tourists attractions in the area like Folks museum, Samchongdong, Insadong, Jogysa temple etc."
4429,4.0,"You can only admire everything from the outside. Buildings and surrounding areas are perfectly maintained. Even if you are on a tight budget and /or a tight schedule you should take an extra ticket to visit the gardens. Try to visit this place early morning when there are not too many students about. They sometimes make such a racket that it's impossible to understand the guide. It happened to me this time whilst on an afternoon tour . When you are at the palace, don't miss the next famous landmark worth a visit : the old traditional Hankok Village which starts a couple of streets from it. I highly recommend Changdeokgung Palace. If you can visit only one palace, visit this one .. with a guide. Some guided tours are free. Enjoy!"
4430,5.0,Its a historic walk in to the ancient and rich history and heritage of Korea. One can't help but marvel at the architectural genus of this palace and respect the cultural heritage of this great country.
4431,5.0,"Timing our visit to the Royal Palace with their free English guided tour made this very enjoyable. If you want to do it on your own, bear in mind it's huge with very little English explaination. Wear good walking shoes and bring lots of water."
4432,4.0,"Another one of those spots on the Soeul ""must see"" list. Worth the entrance fee, lots to see inside."
4433,5.0,Take the free English guide at 13:00 and don't miss the guard change ceremony. Also visit National Folk Museum. Amazing place to relax and drink your sweet potato latte or green tea latte both are amazing.
4434,5.0,The place to visit in soeul. Where you can see how the olden age tradition of the soldiers how they communicate and changing the shifts. The music and slogans was impressive. The big drum was highlight.  The ticket price to get in to the palace is 3₩. Its in the middle of the city. The scenic from the palace is astonishing. The must visit place and know about the kirean traditions.
4435,5.0,"If it is your first visit to Seoul, make sure to visit Gyeongbokgung. Just this will do, no need to visit others. Ticket price reasonably at krw3,000 per adult, if you wear hanbok, it will be free entry. If time allows, join one of the free tour guided by English, Mandarin or Japanese speaking Korean lady, they provide good insights and some history for your easy understanding. Thereafter, you can explore more on your own. Do note that the palace closed on every Tuesday."
4436,4.0,"We did this free transit tour by the city of Seoul and while the place itself is amazing, there is nothing much to see especially if you have no background on korean history like i did."
4437,3.0,The palace is very beautiful but you must wear rubber shoes since the palace is very big. There are lot of photo ops in Gyeongbokgung Palace.
4438,4.0,"Went on winter time . On a clear blue day. The palace is really beautiful . Walked all the way in to the quiet lake - the scenery is good. enjoy the quiet grounds, far from the grp tour. lots of small palaces / ""departments"" within the palace ground . Visit the National Folk / palace museum at the same time if you got time . opp the palace (back gate) is the president blue house."
4439,4.0,"Studied this during architectural history class so it's fun to walk around. I arrived around 3:30 and was just about to catch ""changing guards"". There are local students who would like some ""language exchange"" experience that would give free tours. I was told by the local that if you want to, you can get to try on the traditional korean costume for free in the information center. I didn't have to time to do so, but you could go and see if you are interested. There are quite some girls wearing and walking around and a few guys too."
4440,4.0,"The main reason I wanted to visit this palace is because they filmed Rooftop Prince and other periodic Korean dramas here. This place is beautiful. The architectures are amazing and the beans to hold the roof have very intricate drawings on them. Some of the doors were locked but I was still happy to visit this place. Kings and queens walked the paths I walked. History and laws were created and made here. Its amazing to see that, most part of the walkways around the palace were just dirt. Amazed me that the kings and queens were frugal. Paintworks were beautifully preserved and same goes to the building. Love the scenery because since its spring, the palace flowers blooms and highlighted the beauty of the place even more. If you have a toddler, be sure to wear walking shoes because you will mostly be walking on dirt, just like the royalty who used to lived there. Beautiful..."
4441,5.0,Visited this palace as part of a tour. It was also a school holiday so there were so many children and teenagers there. It was very beautiful but I wish we had more time there.
4442,4.0,"Been here 3 times - 8 years ago first time. Awesome place. However, I have taken the English tour and found it great. Not so this time. The palace grounds were extremely crowded. There were so many people on the tour that many times you could not hear the guide or she started talking before everyone could actually get to her location.So many people that it was hard to look inside some of the structures. There were huge tour bus parked outside the palace - so hundreds of people are swarming in at once. I was told by a local that evening when I remarked on the difference experience I had that there is a big uptick in Chinese tourists and these tour buses are everywhere. So just note that the English tour may not be that great. But the tour is free with palace admission so just try to stick close to the guide and return to explore the buildings when the tour is done. The place is amazing and worth it."
4443,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is the palace all first time visitors should see. Plan to spend some time there, a visit to the National Palace Museum which is on site is very interesting and can take up a good part of your time. Keep track of your time as you would want to see the changing of the guards ceremony."
4444,4.0,"When we visited we saw the change of the guard at the main gates. I'm not sure how frequently this occurs but it's worth checking out to see if you cancoincide your visit. The uniforms of the guards are colourful and flamboyant and you can take photos with them much the same way as you can with the guards in London. There was also a lot of young Koreans visiting in traditional dress when we were there. The grounds, lake and palace are nice - you need to set aside a couple of hours"
4445,5.0,"We spent about three hours at this lovely palace, which we thought was the nicest in Seoul. It was very good value to get in, and guided tours in English were included in the price. The gardens were beautiful and the old traditional buildings full of character. We loved the way a lot of Koreans dress up in national costumes to visit the palaces, adding to the atmosphere. We got some lovely photos while here and thoroughly enjoyed our visit."
4446,5.0,Have been to Gyeongbokgung Palace 4 times. It is an interesting place that you are allowed to explore without a tour guide. There are many buildings on the large grounds that you can walk into and take pictures. Most of the signs are in Korean as well as English. At certain times there are performances done by Koreans in costumes that date back to when the Palace was occupied. It is very interesting!
4447,4.0,A stunning reconstructed palace in the heart of Seol. ₩3000 to get in and a further ₩3000 for an audio guide and definitely worth it.  Not a whole lot of information to read so I recommend the audio guide.  Take some time to sit and take it all in and then hit up the nearby shopping district afterwards.
4448,5.0,"Just go there to relealise this. I had been here more than once. Roam around or just sit. The serene environment and the peace and tranquility will embrace you. If you like History, you will enjoy the years this palace has stood by. If you dont, you will enjoy the Nature here that will help you to be with yourself."
4449,5.0,Our first tourist site visit on the trip. It is right at the station that bears the same name. Best exit to use is #5 and then you are right there. We were able to see the changing of the guard. The palace was built in 1394. It is from the Joseon Dynasty. Good for wandering and taking pictures.
4450,4.0,"Enjoyable tour of the palace given, free of charge, by students of the local language college wanting to improve their English. If asked do say yes to this service. It really is free and you'll get much more out of your visit. Lovely kids."
4451,5.0,Great place to go for a little cultural and historical experience. Some of the locals came dressed in the traditional hanbok cloting.
4452,5.0,"This was my third visit and I love it everytime. If it is warm and humid then prepare to sweat as you will be walking a lot.  If you plan it right you can also get in for free as we did this time (by chance), but the downside is having far bigger crowds than usual.  Make sure you also see the Blue House which is at the back if the park.  The palace is beautiful, very traditional korean. The ponds and park also make this a great outing. For a better experience try to come during the change of guards or other special events to be fully immersed in korean traditions.  If you are in Seoul and you only have time for one palace then this is the best!"
4453,5.0,Awesome palace...just like in the kdramas I've watched. Great sight and for picture taking as well. A myst see change if royal guards.
4454,4.0,"I happened in Seoul a bit out of accident, but have loved this city. It's important to mix a bit of culture into a trip and the central location of this palace did make it an easy visit. Admission is also quite cheap. The guards dress very vibrantly and ate stationed on the front gate. Have your picture with them, just no touching. Time spent here is dependant on the individual, I grew restless after a few similar looking buildings and some nice gardens and completely missed that there was even a gift shop, the place is quite vast so if you want to see every nook and cranny than budget a couple of hours. Also be prepared for the school tours and a fair number of people."
4455,3.0,"its a big palace, you can imagine how to lived that dynasty, how they communicate without gadget cause this palace is very big and quite far from other place to the other"
4456,5.0,The place is very big and beautiful. Take the map on the information centre and walk around. I haven't got a guidedd tour but it was ok as I had my Lonely Planet guide in hands. Go there with sun otherwise it might be a bit boring.
4457,5.0,"A short review for a huge place! I cannot imagine how amazing it would have been when it was built. As this is a replica, there is a little let down. Still beautiful grounds & buildings from the 1800's"
4458,3.0,"I read a few strongly negative reviews, so that sort of inspired me to write a less nasty one - for balance... I do not know if I was just lucky, and went there at the right time of the right day, but there was virtually NOBODY else around, outside of my immediate party. Of course, that could possibly have had something to do with the company that I was in, as my friends' father was a high ranking Korean military hero? He was sort of leading us around this venue, and I suppose that may have been the reason why nobody else was around at that time, but I think it was a neat place, and I'm glad I got the chance to see it. It was a splendid photo-op, to mark of my checklist."
4459,3.0,"Beautifully restored after a tumultuous history that left large parts destroyed, the palace is a monument to the resilience of Koreans and the importance of their history. More understated and elegant than the Forbidden City, the palace can be enjoyed as a stroll in an hour or as a full half days' exploration activity. For future visitors: there is not much shade (particularly in the central parade ground area where the changing of the guard may be viewed) and it can be very hot in the summer months."
4460,5.0,The most impressive and very large palace in Seoul that you have to visit if you have a day time. For me it was the first stop. At the end of the visit I enjoyed the changing of the guard ceremony. Must go!
4461,5.0,Cant help but give this one top marks. It was nice and peaceful in the palace grounds which was great away from the hustle and bustle of the city. But we really lucked out...to celebrate the 94th anniversary of childrens day entrance was free so seeing as we didnt even have to pay i cant not give it top marks.
4462,4.0,It's definitely a must see when you're in Seoul. The entrance ticket is cheap and its more cheaper when you get the combo tickets for the 4 Palace.
4463,4.0,"It was crowded with both local and tourists when we visited. It was difficult to see all the sites in the rain as it was muddy between sites. Nevertheless, it was grand. It was however not my favourite. I prefer to walk around the secret garden at Changdeokgung."
4464,5.0,"The first day we went there was not actually a good experience because we were not aware that the palace was close on Tuesdays. It was disappointing but they let us visit the Palace Museum instead. The next day my sister and I still went positively hoping we could get in. And finally we did and for free! I was about to pay at the ticket booth when the lady told us that they were holding their National Culture Day and that admission was for free. Visiting Gyeongbukgung was on top of my list even before we arrived in Seoul. It was spring so the air was cool, cooler than the day before and we were glad about it. We took hundreds of pictures from the gates to the pots and stairs of the temple. It was like remembering all the Korean dramas I had watched before. But what I had realized was, I was setting foot on the same ground where kings and queens of Joseon walked and stood. It was a very happy experience!"
4465,4.0,"Totally unintentionally we came to Seoul during the lantern festival. As a result we received full entry and were also offered an English tour by a group of school children (as part of a club activity). We took them up on their offer and were extremely glad we did. They took us around the palace, explaining to us a great deal about its history and cultural significance.  The palace itself is very similar to many others and is still being reconstructed back to its former glory. However, the reconstruction is very realistic and it is possible to still gain a feel for its original significance. The gardens at the back allow strolls into the quieter regions of the palace providing a welcome break from the inevitable crowds."
4466,4.0,"Visiting the Palace is definitely a step back in time but the destruction wrought on it by Japanese forces at the time meant that little of the original structure remains. Still, the restoration work is excellent and walking the vast grounds is one of the most pleasant things to do in Seoul. Admission is about $3.00 however I strongly recommend you hire the audio guide for an additional $3.00. If you see Koreans wearing traditional dress walking around the Palace, many do so because they get free entry. I did note that there is good wheelchair access throughout the site but be prepared for a bumpy ride across the central courtyard."
4467,4.0,"great palace which has been rebuilt for may times. When I was there no so crowded so I was able to explore more, took some nice spot pictures. Affordable entrance fee with lot thing that can we expect"
4468,4.0,"Loved this palace. It is right smack in the middle of seoul, so it is very charming to see a traditional palace, surrounded by the modern technologies of high rise buildings and cars. If you are visiting, don't forget to stop by tosokchon which serves the best samgyetang. Go inbetween lunch and dinner times or you'll be in for a long wait."
4469,4.0,"Visited Gyeongbokgung Palace during winter, summer and spring. Different season different feel. Entrance is free if you're using hanbok. Every side of the palace is worth for a memorable picture. Good for a romantic walk among couple, an educational trip for families and great for group of friends to enjoy pictorial scenery. Dont forget to watch guard changing ceremony. A unique event."
4470,5.0,"Had wonderful time there, the place is very well-maintained. It is quite big so I recommend to reserve at least 2 hours to enjoy all the little bits there. I also really liked almost one hour traditional music show there, no idea whether it is part of their normal schedule"
4471,5.0,"Make sure you go on a tour. There are free tours, you just need to register online. I was on a tour with 3 other girls. Having a tour guide gives you a lot of information about their history. Its not boring nor purely political. They gave us insight on how the royalty lived, even their personal lives, and some tragedies that happened in that palace. It was interesting. Long walk, but the place is really amazing."
4472,4.0,I have visited this palace before. I did not realize the ground was so huge until I had to enter via the National Folk Museum entrance. I was wearing hanbok and I got in for free. This palace is on the must-see list of all tours. It can get crowded especially shortly before and after the changing of the guards. Come early to avoid bus loads of tourists.
4473,5.0,"The palace is simply mesmerizing. Whenever you step in, you'll automatically grab your camera to capture the beauty.  Tip: 1) be there on 10 am to watch the guardian-changing ceremony. 2) take a photo with hanbok-wearing local. 3) don't waste too much time here, there are other palaces around."
4474,5.0,One of the Main Korean Palaces that must be visited during your stay in Seoul. There is a free English Tour guide and you should catch the changing or guards ceremony.
4475,4.0,I recommend to visit this place which is very interesting for you to discover South Korean history. Enjoy it.
4476,5.0,Very beautiful exterior and the areas are big too... we had a guide so he explained a lot on the history and which houses belongs to who... you start with the palace and ends with the museum
4477,4.0,"Attractive palace with enormous well kept grounds. Particularly impressive is the Temple of Fragence. Changing of the Guard ceremony is, to western eyes, unusual"
4478,5.0,This is a must see if you are in Seoul. The building is not accessible to the public on most days and is used for official functions. It is a beautiful example of traditional Korean architecture and stunningly beautiful. I was very impressed.
4479,5.0,"Visited the palace as part of the free Incheon transit tour. The place was huge and offers a glimpse on Korea's past.  spent around an hour here, would suggest a longer stay to fully appreciate the place."
4480,5.0,"I have visited this Palace during the Lantern Festival so it was free thus I cannot comment on the ticket pricex. It has the nicest localisation of the all Palaces as you can see beautiful green mountains in the backgroun. I'd say that if you have time to see only one, see this one."
4481,5.0,"Up until recently there was a night time openning event. Normally it is operated from 9a.m to 5p.m.  So when you grab a chance of night time opening, it will be great. You can enjoy the traditional architecture style of Chosun Dynasty through from 14th to 17th century. You can't imagine there still stands a beautiful palace by the downtown of Seoul.  It's the symbolic scenery of Seoul to get along well with tall buildings and historic palace. Those complexcities are the feature of Korea."
4482,4.0,"Nice for a wander around on a nice sunny day. Not at all expensive for how much of the palace and the grounds you get to walk around. Can easily spend a few hours walking around the palace and the gardens. Definitely worth a visit, an absolute gem in amongst the high rise buildings of central Seoul"
4483,5.0,"A huge park of old palaces right next to modern buildings. In a way it symbolizes both the old and new Korea.  I recommend taking a guided tour. Our guide was excellent and provided background and perspective to the palace grounds. Specifically how the Kings/Queens lived during the Joeson Dynasty. Especially when you compare this to today's modern sensibilities.  There is also an audio guide, but I did not use. Perhaps the next visit."
4484,5.0,I wouldn't be expecting that the palace is wide and with two museums that can be visited after. Got amazed with places surrounded with almost blooming lotuses. The tranquility and the fresh air ease away the problems and anxieties. Truly educational and relaxing at the same time.
4485,5.0,"There was lovely parade, nice atmosphere there, a place you must see if visit Seoul!!! The palace is big, there is an interesting museum which just opened. Great to learn their history."
4486,5.0,"This entire place is awesome! Its a very beautiful and nice place to go but be warned, it can get a little tiring to walk around as it is extremely big. You can rent a hanbok (Korean traditional costume) and walk around to get the experience of the olden days. If you are lucky and are on the right time, you might even get a chance to see the guards changing 'shift'. It is highly recommended to visit this place!"
4487,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the most famous and largest palatial complex available in Seoul. It is well located above the Gwanghwamun Square and close to Line 3 Metro station. It is fairly well preserved and reconstituted, while some areas are not accessible, some others clearly showcase the way of living during the Joseon Dynasty with different rooms spanning each building serving as quarters for either the King, the Queen, the Court and Guests at the Palace. It gets a little repetitive as the buildings were duplicated in different sizes but the overall ground is magical and includes performances, the National Palace Museum, the Folk Museum, etc. Get patient as not everything is well indicated and perhaps a group tour would be better. Note that you'll get free admission if you dress in the traditional costume, which seems to appeal the young generation!"
4488,5.0,"This palace and grounds are kept immaculate, you will not be going around saying ""that looks shabby, they should fix that up"", nay! You will be impressed by their upkeep and slight modernisation (the electric light!). Lots of good looking young ladies walk around in traditional dress (some men too, but it's a minority), peacefully enjoying the gardens and place, making you think upon olden day times whilst they are taking selfies and posing in duck face... Must see."
4489,5.0,"For best view, avoid dust storm periods in Spring. It can ruin your day. Also, winter may not be best. There are restaurants inside but they are only good for light meals. Also, try their tea shops. These are fairly good. There is underground parking but you must arrive very early. The spaces are quickly gone. Also watch out for so many tour buses. One good thing is that it is very close to downtown."
4490,4.0,"It's a beautiful place, you can almost see the grandiosity of Korean nobility of old. Confucian kings ruled for more than 500 years until the beginning of 20th century. There are two museums in the complex. Palace museum is great and folk museum's shop is worth a look. It's quite a long walk though, and not for rainy days, because inside there are no pavements. You shogun check the time for guided tours in English, when I went it was 11:00. And you should plan to go there at the time of presentations usually held at the afternoon, it was 14:00 When I went so I missed them. There are presentations of royal guard exchange, martial arts and others, at different times."
4491,4.0,"My cousins and I did visit the place first before going to other nearby palaces in town but because of too hot weather we never stayed long actually.. The best time to visit this place is when the sun sets.. We went to this place at noon time and we never had our hats and umbrellas and so the scorching heat was not fine for us..But never, never miss going to this place when you go to Seoul.."
4492,5.0,"This is the largest of all the Seoul palaces, though not the most charming (Changdeokgung is). What makes it the best single choice is the fact that it also contains the National Folk and Palace Museums (both free)."
4493,4.0,One of historical place that must visit while in Korea. Try to rent Korean traditional dress and walk around with it. Better come in the morning as at noon too crowded
4494,3.0,Not too special! Only a big famous place for a walk. Many korean girls wear traditional hanbok for selfie or go along with professional photographer. But it is good to go once if you haven't been to there.
4495,4.0,"I'm a fan of history, art, and architecture, and the Palace was a wonderful way to experience all three. We went during December, so it was rather chilly. The Palace tour takes about an hour if you go with a guide (and read reviews of tour guides before going to an attraction - ours was rather pushy and made us feel like schoolchildren), and we would've enjoyed this more had we done it ourselves with perhaps a guide book. However, the history of the palace is very interesting and a lot of the centuries-old work is still intact. You will definitely enjoy the daily Changing of the Guard (at noon)!"
4496,4.0,"The palace was not open for public to go inside and roam the halls, but the site was well-kept. Traffic was pretty tough heading towards this area but thats only because its a tourist attraction. What we did was have the van we came in, drop us from a distance and pick us up at an agreed location when we were done touring."
4497,5.0,"Nice place but kinda bored as only sight seeing and have to walk a lot as the place really big. Not able to catch the ceremony, coz my frenx told me is an interesting show. :) overall nice place :)"
4498,4.0,It is much smaller than Beijing's Palace but similar set-up. Many Korean came here with traditional costumes on that day and friendly enough to take photo with us. Thank you!
4499,4.0,A must see if you are in Seoul. Beautiful landscape and architecture. Similar to the palaces in China but it is worth visiting!
4500,5.0,Gyeongbukgong palace is in the middle of the city hall district in Seoul. It's the biggest palace (if im not mistaken) in Korea and was once home to the Royal Family. The buildings and environment are preserved so well that you actually can't help but think that you have managed to time travel and wound up back into the Joseon Era. Overall a Wonderful and beautiful place. A must see for any tourist!
4501,4.0,"A must visit place when you are in Seoul. Walk around and experience the atmosphere and the actual buildings within the palace walls in the city. If you have the chance, see the guard rotation at the main gate as well. Recommend you to buy the combination ticket, even though you don't need to see all the 4 palaces."
4502,5.0,"Was lucky enough to see the changing of the guards ceremony, very colorful! This place is Amazing, so much to see. Make sure you read all of the information plaques. Very highly recommend"
4503,5.0,"A must see. It is better to go with the tour. They have a microphone so easy to listen to. They have tour in Korean, English and in Japanese."
4504,4.0,"It is similar to some palaces in China. But as the most beautiful palace in Korea, it is still worth of visiting. I personal think you need a tour guide to tell you the history of this palace."
4505,4.0,"Beautiful palace in middle of Seoul. We hired han-bok at a near by store and walked around, taking photos, which was a lot of fun Some beautiful sights. However my memory is rather faint (after about a month) what the differences are between Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung other than the latter was bigger and had a big garden (Secret Garden-Biwon) - so if you are pressed for time, you could do either one of them rather than both."
4506,4.0,"A tremendous place to see a real palace inside a metro city. Entering the front gate you will be welcomed by a majestic palace gate. You will ejoy the old building with great maintanance effort make sure you explore the whole complex with a tour guide which will helps you understand each building function and how a royal lived on that era, including technology on those days which affect modern korean people"
4507,4.0,This is my 2nd visit but its much different as compared to winter period. Do not miss the change of guards and be all out and rent a hanbok for great photo around the palace. Of course take a tour if you are interested in the history as this is the grandest palaces in Seoul.
4508,4.0,"You haven't been to Seoul if you haven't visited this palace.  Glad to have visited this place on my first day in Seoul. It somehow enlightened me in an intuitive way of the present way of life of the people. It's something I can't put into words but just felt and understood.  Sense of pride for their heritage,history and culture is very evident in the Koreans.  I'm glad to have patiently waited for the English guided tour. It gave me a deeper appreciation of Korea's culture and tradition.  Highly recommended for history buffs and even better when touring with a guide."
4509,5.0,A nice place to visit and you could spend a whole day here as it is a vast site.  Many authentic buildings and alot of open space with ponds and lakes. There is plenty of information to explain the original site.  A nice experience when visiting Seoul. It only cost about £2. For the ticket so is good value.
4510,5.0,"Beautiful palace, check the times for the different tours in different languages. You can purchase combination tickets to three palaces and a shrine and the tickets last three months so they are a good deal. I was able to use all he tickets in the combination during my two week stay."
4511,4.0,"Be sure and time your visit for Changing of the guard. Very colourful and ceremonial pomp. Beautiful ponds and grounds - worth a walk about. Understandably busy and popular as one of Seouls top attractions. Cheap to get in & take an escorted tour in the language of your choice, if your time allows. There were cultural music presentations as well."
4512,4.0,"Main attraction of Seoul, you can easily spend half a day there around the gardens and looking inside the buildings. It's worth it to join a free guided tour, make sure you check out the schedule in advance."
4513,4.0,"Went on the free English speaking tour (you have to pay for entry though), which was very interesting and made it a worthwhile visit. Nice looking palace and gardens."
4514,4.0,Crowded with locals and tourist but this and Changdeokgung Palace are the ones that you really must visit if you are interested at all and your time is limited.
4515,4.0,"The sheer size of the place is impressive and one can easily spend 2-3 hours exploring the grounds. The place is very very popular and when I visited it was full of guided school and tourist groups.  Unfortunately the crowds detract from the serenity of the experience, so it might be worth visiting at opening time to stay ahead of the flood of tourists..."
4516,4.0,A good way to experience the traditional culture of korea Saw some girls renting hanbok and wear it to visit the palace But as usual the palace is flooded with loud tourist group
4517,3.0,"Most of the precincts of this palace looked dry and dusty. Compared to the Indian palaces I have seen, this palace looked too basic. The best parts were the ponds that we saw."
4518,5.0,"Lovely palace but very crowded , most of the time,but worth going as we get to see the old charm of Korean history , the garden are just amazing"
4519,5.0,Magical night walking around the palace after dark. The concert at the Pavillon showcased classical Korean music and dance. I enjoyed it even more than wondering around in the day.
4520,4.0,"We visited during peak festival time as a family of three, with a 2 year old in a stroller. Overall, this is a great place to visit. We would have enjoyed it more if it hadn't been so busy, but obviously as we visited during a festival it was to be expected. Good: Huge. Seriously. You could probably spend two full days here if you saw every inch of this place. Very interesting. Lots of signs in English. They also have audio tours available in English (and other languages) if you like that sort of thing. Lots of other things are connected to this, including a children's museum. If you like museums, you could spend several days going through all the ones surrounding this Palace.  Bad: Since this hasn't been much restored, the ground is very uneven. It is very difficult to push a stroller or wheelchair over it. The staff do their best to help by putting ramps over doorways, up stairways, etc, but it is still difficult. Not necessarily bad, but be careful about going here on a windy day. The sand/dirt on the ground is very loose and will blow into eyes and noses.  Definitely a must-see if you enjoy/are interested in Korean history."
4521,5.0,The 3.30pm tour is quite good. Lady spoke English well. We could comprehend what she said. Thats a lot in Korea  Ticket full price is 3k Won. Thats it worth.
4522,3.0,"Gyeongbokgung was the first palace I visited and I was awed by the sheer size of it. Set aside about two hours to fully enjoy the sights and catch the changing of the guards ceremony if you can. It gets really crowded at certain parts because of tour groups. Closed on Tuesdays and costs ₩3,000 for admission for adults."
4523,4.0,"We arrived the Palace early as there is guided tour of the substantial palace grounds in different languages: English, Mandarin (and possibly French?)  The guide has done a great job in showing us bits of history, and even teased us with couple of questions to keep up the interest.  A most enjoyable experience but prepared to walk for an hour of so, and some of the grounds were a bit uneven. If you're concerned, then bring a walking pole to be on the safe side."
4524,4.0,"Enjoyed seeing the palace complex, I was glad I was with an organized tour group since I learned a lot of history that made it much more interesting"
4525,4.0,"Personally, I like visiting places of historical and cultural value, especially palaces. Gyeongbok Palace is conveniently located from Metro Station and it gives an insight to the Imperial Korea in the past. I am quite surprised with how well maintained this palace is, given the fact that it was set up in the 14th century. For those of you who like taking pictures, this palace offers many spots to capture 'those' moments.  Even though Gyeongbok Palace was the main palace of the Korean Emperor, I find that it somehow lacks the grandeur of other palaces that I visited."
4526,4.0,"Watched changing of guard practice then the full works. There is English, Japanese, Mandarin audio explanations broadcasted so it's easy to follow. It's open in evenings without enaction. Beside it is the museum which is free. Also it's best location to walk towards Blue House and Buckhon Hanok Village."
4527,3.0,"If you're first time in Korea, I suggest you start exploring the history & culture first, (shopping and entertainment can come later), because Seoul is rich with it. They presevered their culture well. I personally love the palaces. I went straight here after I check in my luggage, just in time for the changing of guard ceremony at 1pm.  To go here, I use metro line 5 to Gwanghwamun station and used exit 2. I started at Gwanghwamun square, where Statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yi are and walk up to the palace. it doesn't take long. Tips: at the ticket counter we bought a combination ticket for the palaces + Jongmyo Shrine for 10,000₩. These include The Secret Garden at Changdeokgung Palace. If you buy separate tickets, entrance fee to each palaces can be up to 3000₩ (and The Secret Garden had an additional fee of 5000₩)"
4528,5.0,"If you ever go to Seoul, you have to go to Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's great with friends or as a solo traveler. Easily accessible from the subway. Makes for great tourist photos. Truly a piece of Seoul you can't miss!"
4529,4.0,good place to learn about the olden days of Korea. was expecting more exhibits though. the guard changing ceremony was pretty awesome. take pictures with the guards too!
4530,2.0,"I love visiting historical places but not this one. The look and style of this palace is very similar to the Chinese one, so, you can still take some good pictures here. But this palace is kind of empty and there is not even a single sign to explain the history."
4531,5.0,"It's like you went back in time! For me it's like I've been to my favorite Korean period dramas. The Changing of the Guards Ceremony is a must see. Lots of photo opps for, I guarantee you!"
4532,5.0,We spend about 1/2 day here exploring the castle and its lovely grounds.  Don't forget -- It's closed every Tuesday!
4533,5.0,The palace offers some great photo opportunities and lets you wander freely and explore at your leisure!
4534,4.0,"The best of the old palaces here. While it will greatly underwhelm those who have been to the Forbidden City in Beijing, Gyeongbokgung is still a pleasant place for a tourist to visit for an afternoon. Definitely check out the changing of the guard ceremony. Also, you can get a photo with the presidential palace in the back."
4535,3.0,I've been here before and it is great to see. Take into account that it's closed on Tuesdays. The palace has been rebuilt several times.
4536,5.0,"THE GYEONGBOKGUNG PALACE AT SEOUL, KOREA The Gyeongbokgung Palace was set up in 1394, and was the very first palace of the Joseon Dynasty (1392 to 1910). The four other royal palaces in Seoul are Gyeonghuigung, Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung and the Deoksugung. These palaces are UNESCO World Cultural Heritage sites Gyeongbokgung was built by King Taejo, founder of the Joseon Dynasty, and is the grandest and most exquisite of all the palaces in Seoul. It is one of the finest examples of Korean architecture. Entry to the palace is via the main gate known as Gwanghwamun. It is made almost entirely of granite and is surmounted by a Korean-style twin roof. The palace buildings, on the other hand, are made almost entirely of wood, and are aesthetically painted with Korean motifs. Many of the royal family’s possessions have been transferred to the National Palace Museum of Korea, on the same grounds, where they continue to be on display. Thus, the main palace building is virtually unfurnished. The main palace building was the former residence of the Korean royal family. Alongside is the beautiful Gyeonghoeru pavilion and the well-manicured palace gardens, both of which retain their original charm. At the entrance are guards, as well as palace “officials” dressed n various colourful period costumes – primarily reds or greens. Tourists love to have themselves photographed by their side – such pictures having high souvenir value. However, the icing on the cake is the very elaborate ceremony of the Changing of the Royal Guards, performed three times a day. It is a journey back in time, to an era of pomp, glory and grandeur. The National Folk Museum of Korea,covered in a previous item, is also on the palace grounds. Hormuz P. Mama"
4537,4.0,"Loved seeing this beautiful place nestled in the heart of such a cosmopolitain city. The architecture was breathtaking, with so much to see for a really affordable entrance fee. There were so many hidden areas to take photos without tourists all over. Had a great time."
4538,5.0,Our visit was timed perfectly... not a huge crowd and pleasant weather. We enjoyed venturing on our own and seeing the beautiful gardens.
4539,5.0,"The palace is huge and it takes time to go around it. There is a museum located inside, where you can see the history of the nation and what the ancient Korea looked like. Make sure you do not miss the shift changing of the guards at the gate of the palace. You can take photo with the guards as well, they wear the traditional clothing. Do not use selfie stick though, the guards will forbid you."
4540,5.0,"Although largely reconstructed after the second world war, Gyeongbokgung Palace is an impressive example of Korean classical architecture. Must-see for any Seoul visitor with a few hours to spare."
4541,5.0,"Take an English-language tour, which is included in the purchase of the entrance ticket. This ticket is free to people 65 and older. Allow at least two hours to enjoy this magnificent and historic palace. Read about it before going and find out the times of the English--language tour."
4542,5.0,"So amazing place and too many travelers on there not special for foreign, it's including Korean as well. If you wear hunbok, the entrance price is free."
4543,5.0,"It takes about 1 and a half hour to look around the palace. If you are into architecture, it is worth of visiting. The ticket is cheap and it is even free if you are wearing the Korean traditional clothes. (Hanbok)"
4544,5.0,"Joseon dynasty palace in seoul. If you enter the palce,you can see not only palace but beautiful garden and so on."
4545,5.0,"This is a must see if you're in Seoul. And do join the free walking tours for the explanation on the palace(about 60 mins). The guides are friendly and knowledgeable. After the guided tour, wait around and witness the changing of the guard. There are 2 types, one just the guard changeovers. Then there's another with major ceremony and a band. not sure which times, but stick around for the major one. There's toilets and a cafe inside the palace grounds near the gift shop. Good photo opportunity near the pagoda facing the mountains at the north side of the palace"
4546,4.0,"I really enjoyed the palace and especially the guard changing ceremony. This is definitely a must-see when you are in Seoul. As I have been there on a Sunday it was very crowded. I you have the time and option to go on another day, than do this...especially when you want to take beautiful pictures."
4547,5.0,"We took the free english guided tour included in ticket and she was very good. The tour lasts about an hour and visits all the key building. The guide will explain how the king and queen lived in their quarters, how the buildings were heated and designed. The palace is beautifully reconstructed and we will return as the work is ongoing to restore more buildings. From the palace it is a short walk to Bukchon and Insadong."
4548,4.0,The costumes...the history...the beautiful garden inside are a must when in seoul...it represents the best of the korean history...one of the most beautiful attractions in seoul...inside you'll find lots of tourists wearing the traditional costume...it will be fun to take a photo with some...
4549,4.0,"So excited visit this place,bcoz im wearing Hanbok (traditional costume of korea) so it looks special when you taking picture wif hanbok infront of the Gyeongbokgung Palace"
4550,3.0,This palace represented the determination of the pple's desire to keep and maintain their history. Rebuilt many times I don't think any of the Kings had lived or used this palace before. So this place is more like a record of what it was like in the past. It is still interesting enough although I wished there were more signage to explain the history.
4551,5.0,"This palace is apsolutly beautiful. An added feature included in the very reasonable entry fee is the most colourful changing of the guard. Well worth a visit, highly recommended."
4552,4.0,"The place is huge so prepare to walk. Since it's Spring, the place was filled with spring flowers and cherry blossoms. A lot of people were roaming around the palace premises in Hanbok which made the scenery even beautiful. The palace architecture especially in the Throne room is so detailed and magnificent. A must visit place in Seoul."
4553,4.0,Reconstructed palaces but historically accurate. Wear comfortable shoes and bring an extra battery to take lots of pictures. Make sure to read so you'll know their past and present. There is a perfect spot in this place where you can literally look at the past on your left and the present on your right. It has coffee and souvenir shops too.
4554,5.0,We were really fascinated about the scale of this palace. It was huge and magnificent. The pavilions are all lovely and all of this is right in the middle of urban Seoul. You can't get any contradictory than that.
4555,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung is the largest of the 5 grand palaces and worth the stop. It can be overrun with lots of kids on class field trips but once you get away from the first few entrance rooms, there is lots of space within the walls to find areas that are very secluded and peaceful too. The grounds are impeccable and stunning with the Bukhansan mountain backdrop. In April, the flowers are blooming, even some cherry blossoms left. The changing of the guards ceremony at the main entrance is charming and well worth the 15 minute stop to catch it. The free Folk Museum within the Palace grounds is also well worth the visit."
4556,4.0,"Entering the compound, like taking a time machine back to the ancient time of Korea, where the emperor still have the Vito power. It also feels like entering a scene in the korean drama. See how the king lived, the life in a grade palace.  At the same time, we can feel that no matter how great a king was, finally it back to the earth, ash to ash, soil to soil.  Then the democracy hit, slowly Seoul becomes the Seoul today, modern, fast pace, developed.  It worth to take a walk to this historical place, but suggestd to do it during spring or autumn, particularly the festival of cherry blossom."
4557,5.0,"I may be wrong, but I think this is the largest and main palace in Seoul. Yes it is huge and could take you about 2-3 hours of you wanted to go to every single area in the palace grounds. A must-visit to see a slice of history."
4558,5.0,We visited at a time when the cherry blossoms and other blooms made this an especially enjoyable place.
4559,5.0,"Our guide advised us that the Palace has been destroyed repeatedly over the centuries, yet the S Koreans have refused to forget their rich heritage. The Palace is immense and very impressive and has been lovingly restored. The place is immaculate and well cared for, and is a must see for all travellers"
4560,4.0,The biggest palace on Seoul..catch the changing of guard ceremony and be taken back to time...The feeling is surreal.Take a stroll at this majestic palace with great view!!
4561,4.0,"The Palace is a lovely recreation of the palace from long ago. Much of Seoul's old buildings were destroyed during the wars, but they did a great job rebuilding and preserving this cultural heritage. I liked walking around the smaller courtyards where there were fewer people and more undisturbed family picture taking opportunities."
4562,5.0,"I loved visiting the Palace. Walked around the palace, explored it fully and enjoying getting to know the beautiful designs, culture, traditions and architecture!"
4563,5.0,This is a beautiful palace -- the largest of the major palaces. The grounds were lovely. Great photo ops!
4564,5.0,"Grandest palace in Seoul set against mountain backdrop. Many pavilions & halls spread out on sprawling grounds, prepare to walk! Closed on tues. Daily changing of guards 10am-3pm."
4565,4.0,"When we arrived there , it had been snowing and the palace gave us a wonderful sight. Just on time for the parade. It was quite thrilling to see these men in costumes and the sound of the gong.... We then entered the complex and visited this huge place. The atmosphere was quite eerie with the snow covering the ground and the roofs. We had a great time."
4566,4.0,"Oldest and biggest palace in Seoul. You'll need time to explore it, since it is so vast. Mostly palace buildings, though it does have a very charming back garden and a shrine as well. Don't miss out on the throne room, I found that to the most impressive building."
4567,3.0,"One of the cultural/historical places to visit in Seoul. The grounds is not as big as Beijing's Forbidden Palace, but it's worth a visit. A good place to go to take a break from all the endless shopping."
4568,5.0,We thoroughly enjoyed touring through this palace and also indulging in the architecture and history of this amazing location. The ceremony of the guards and people in traditional dress was an added highlight to this visit
4569,3.0,Nice place worth a visit for anyone who has not been to Seoul. Changing of the guard is worth to witness. Need about 1-2 hours to complete the tour.
4570,4.0,It is huge there's no other words to describe it. I would have loved to either read more about the background prior or either attended palace tours that they have. I went a couple of days before April so there weren't many cherry blossoms - only a few trees had started blossoming. The scale of the palace complex was huge and I could spend a whole day in it. The huge scale of tourists and students made taking pictures impossible. In addition there weren't any signs at each building providing more information and any furniture to indicate how it would have looked in the past.
4571,5.0,"Grand palace would be an understatement to describe the whole compound of the palace. We gave the self-guided tour 2-3 hours but to tour the whole palace for its entirety, a traveler may need at least 4 hours, take minimal pictures, and a lot of energy to complete the entire tour of this palace."
4572,5.0,"Be sure to witness the ""Changing of the guard"" performed hourly 11 - 3, as a spectacle. The collection of buildings within the palace are interesting but basically not a great deal there. Entry is reasonably cheap."
4573,3.0,Great first impression at the front gate(gwanghwamun) but there is very few too see or explore inside. at least there are frequent guard show at the gate.
4574,3.0,"the march was at 10am sharp, so be there on time, it was an experience but i am not a historical person, so seeing it from the outside and watching the guard shifts was good enough. but definitely a possible site to go and experience korea! and listen to historical stories from a tour guide ;)"
4575,4.0,One of the icon when you come to seoul. This is enough interesting place that you have to visit. Many of tourist come here not only international but domestic too. Few people come here with tranditional clothes and mostly young people. You can ask them for photo. Dont forget to see the schedule of changing guard ceremony and explore the palace. You can find museum at back of the palace.
4576,2.0,"This palace is huge and would probably take a good part of the day to explore. I personally did not venture into the palace quarters (seems like you had a pay an entry fee?) but remained outside taking photographs. Some lovely views guaranteed, what with the mountains some distance from the palace in the North. I actually much preferred Changdeok and Deoksu Palaces though. I found the change of guard procession here to be a tad bit disappointing. Also, tourists come here by the bus load and the crowd was overwhelming at just 10:30am in the morning. Needless to say, I left really quickly."
4577,5.0,"A stunning palace in Seoul. The scale of the palace and its grounds took us by surprise as its in the city centre. Very definitely worth a visit. I would recommend watching the changing of the guard. Whilst it's a reenactment, it's a fabulous colourful spectacle."
4578,5.0,"We don't usually sign up for group tours but this was a good one since we were the only clients on the tour. The palace and surrounding grounds are very grand. We were able to see the pageantry of the changing of the guard and the lovely architecture of the palace and rooms for the king and his family. It is a must tour since one can see old Korea surrounded by a new, vital and pristine South Korea. Our well informed guide shared and explained interesting historical information."
4579,5.0,"A wonderful place to visit for everyone. Lots of history here, beautiful architecture and grounds. Visited there on a foggy day, with mountains and the pagoda breaking through, giving everything a very romantic ancient painting appeal."
4580,5.0,Great that they preserved this area. Was able to see the changing of the guard and the inside of the palace.
4581,4.0,"The Palace is a must-see for a first-timer to Seoul. The architecture is beautiful. We didn't do a tour, just walked around and enjoyed the sights."
4582,4.0,We visited the palace meanwhile a few times and can recommend you to put this on your list too. There are guided tours available in foreign languages. We did a few in English when friends came over and there's quite a difference in quality among the different guides. My wife followed once the Chinese guided tour which was apparently best of all. The chinese speaking guide carried apparently so much more knowledge of the history than the English speaking guides we followed so far. The season I liked most is autumn. The different colors around the lake and the ginko tree area are magnificent.
4583,5.0,"We visited this Palace after our visit to the blue house (Cheong Wae Dee). This is the largest Palace in Seoul and it's really huge. The exterior were well maintained. Even though we didn't manage to get an English language tour around the palace, we enjoyed ourselves by taking lots of photos. The cherry blossom trees were so low that we were able to touch and feel them. It was really a beautiful sight to behold with the lake, cherry blossom flowers and the built of the palace.  It's worth the visit. If you don't want to visit all the other palaces, one should visit this one."
4584,4.0,"You would enjoy this place if you like history - otherwise it would just be a huge place to roam. Quite crowded with lots of tour groups. Located just outside the subway. Do catch the changing of guards ""parade"" at 10am and 1pm (there's one more later)."
4585,5.0,"I was impressed by how this heritage building could be located beautifully in the city center with huge land allocation. The palace was maintained very well, and of course this is a great place for photo!"
4586,4.0,the palace is big. u can explore on your own or join a free guided tour. recommend the tour as it is useful to know more about the history and architecture.
4587,5.0,"as per title, this is the best palace that i have visited in korea (i have visited some in seoul and pusan)"
4588,5.0,Get a feel of what life was like in the days when kings ruled Korea .. The throne room is pretty amazing and the price of the ticket is 3000won which is 3usd.. So worth it! You can also rent a self guided tour device or download the app. Lots of people and lots of photo opportunities.!
4589,5.0,"The Palace is awesome and very big. It's fascinate to be part of korean history. However, they should provide more information about history of the Palace for visitor in the leaflet. Got 1 palace I can't remember the palace name, we can go inside but we have to book in advance more than a week to go in. I thought tourist might not know about it until I ask the guard there. I think the palace I mentioned is summer palace. I really want to go in because the tourguide said if we see from inside the palace out at the window, we'll see the view like the painting. That's make me really want to go in!! The Palace close on Tuesday due to korean drama shooting."
4590,4.0,A very big and beautiful palace. Give yourself a few hours to slowly explore the beauty of the palace.
4591,5.0,"big palace, ticket includes the national palace museum & national folk museum. Only manage to cover the folk museum in about 4hrs time so we skipped the palace museum. some parts is still under re-construction, according to the tour guide it will only be fully completed by 2030."
4592,4.0,We arrived in time for changing of guard. Such a great experience. And walking though the entire palace compound was amazing. Such great history everywhere.
4593,5.0,Beautiful palace with interesting marching parade. Did not go in but the view from outside is significant enough. Near subway!
4594,4.0,"Large facility with a modern museum, as well. Great photo opportunities everywhere. Just don't miss the changing of the guards presentation!"
4595,3.0,"Love the architecture of this palace, the huge building and amazing built of this place will make you feel like a Korean royal yourself! :)"
4596,3.0,"If you've seen your fair share of palace, you could be a tad underwhelmed. It isn't opulent, it doesnt have the grandeur and scale of Ottoman, Spanish or Indian palaces. Its charming though. And low key. There is the customary staged ""Changing of the guards"". You'll see the guards soon after out of their outfits in tees resting against the palace walls smoking a cigarette. Its a collection of korean style units spaced across a large piece of land. Its sandy and dusty. There's a temple on one end. If you're into Korean history, yes the wartime facts will be interesting, but otherwise, its a quick 40 min swing by. Combine with Bukchon Village right next to it. There are hordes of tourist buses that will arrive so prepare to jostle."
4597,5.0,"Love this classics destination in Seoul, not the best palace that I have visited in Asia but defiantly worth a visit to look into Korean history. Insadong and the Hanok Village is nearby as well, they are accessible by foot, don't forget to visit them while you see the palace."
4598,4.0,"For us the palace was more about the beautiful gardens it is set in. The area is huge and you could easily spend a few hours wandering around admiring the buildings, ongoing restoration and the very well maintained grounds."
4599,4.0,This palace offers many beautiful historical structures that look surprisingly Chinese. Even though there were quite a lot of people on this Sunday afternoon. It felt tranquil.  There are also many perfect photo opportunities too.
4600,3.0,One thing I love here is the view of the mountain from the entrance and view of modern building in front. We also l0ve the changing of guards.
4601,5.0,The views throughout the palace were amazing. Enjoyed our time there. Could have spent 3-4 hours to take it all in.
4602,5.0,"We spent a day exploring the palace grounds are were not disappointed. The weather was great and really allowed us to maximize our time there. We started out the day by watching the changing of the guard at Gwanghwamun gate (it's worth watching and occurs every few hours around, I think we saw it at 11 am). We did not partake in a guided tour (not sure if they're available) but we did purchase some audio guides which did an adequate job of guiding us around the grounds. In addition to the gate at Gwanghwamun, there are several other gates leading into the main grounds where you can find the main palaces. The entire place is colorful and features an architectural style unique to Korea. Visiting at this time of year is especially good because the cherry blossoms are all blooming, making the palace's numerous gardens very beautiful. There are also royal residences, guest houses, temples and the king's library/study. You can spend many hours in the palace grounds and I would suggest you visit earlier rather than later, as crowds accumulate quickly and the palace closes around 6pm. In all, visiting Gyeongbokgung palace was by far my favorite experience while visiting Seoul and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city and looking for something to do at a relatively low cost (bar minimum was transportation costs plus admission tickets and paying for the audio tour if you want it)."
4603,4.0,"If this is your first time, try to join the in-house tour, or get a map and read the architectural labels to know the historical significance of the things you will see here. It will make you appreciate the place more than just having your pictures taken in here."
4604,3.0,"The complex is nice and some buildings spectacular. The whole place impress because of its overall size. This being said, there is not much to learn or even to do besides walking outside, along the empty or closed palaces. Certainly worth a visit though"
4605,4.0,"The admission fee is Korean Won 3,000 and you can stay all day. Very scenic and pleasant walk. I visited at the tail end of the Cherry blossom season and there were still quite a few trees.  It being Sunday today, many locals came in their traditional costume, and this added the overall flavour to the palace and gave the visitors many photo opportunities"
4606,4.0,"We visited the palace and the cultural history museum (one price gets both, they are connected inside the walls). Luckily had great weather (required), spring blossoms were out and the coming of age were around in their traditional dresses happy to pose for and with us on pictures."
4607,5.0,Very nice place as cherry blossoms all over .. We with kids visited on april 9. So weather was cold and cloudy. Around 13c ..We didnt listen to the guide so we wouldnt be tied up. We got to take our time in looking for good photos to take wc is the most important . there's cafe also where the kids bought hot choco and muffin. .
4608,5.0,"We went last November . Weather turning cold. The place was awesomely beautiful with many nice nature view... Nice maple leaves all over ..  The buildings are so nostalgic as we see them in Korean drama :) if anyone rem watching roof top prince ..  We went in the period when they have many students coming in hanbok .. Boys wore army uniform . Many tourist requested to take pic with them so as my boys ..  We spent abt 4 hours as we explored almost the entire place while sharing with chn. Very educational .. Love to see the mandarin orange tree..  It's so therapeutic to be Juz sitting near to the pond to enjoy the weather , scenery ."
4609,4.0,"We rent KRW1,000 per one automatic earpiece and it gave us great experience to understand Joseon dynasty history with appreciation on how Art took place in the palace and government administration."
4610,5.0,The main palace used by the royals. Not the largest but gives a great picture of the country worked. Used until relatively recently by the last remaining royals. Highly recommended if you are on a time budget.
4611,3.0,Nothing to shout of. I find the attraction need more signage to better appreciate the things we seen here. The only thing I find nice is the guard changing ceremony.
4612,4.0,"Set against the backdrop of mountains on one side, and modern Seoul on the other, the palace is a popular ""must visit"" attraction in Seoul. Don't miss the colourful changing of the guards at 10 am and 2 pm. You can take photos with the guards as well. The park was huge. Many pretty spots for photos. We visited at the turn of winter to spring, when some of the trees were beginning to bloom. It would be spectacular at the height of cherry blossom season, and during autumn. Loads of tourist busses and tour groups, though, but the grounds are huge enough not to feel over crowded. Our guide showed us the Kings and Queens quarters, the event hall, and even the little building where the king had famously invented the Korean written language characters."
4613,4.0,A must visit if you come to Seoul just like Forbidden city is a must visit if you come to Beijing. It is a very large palace complex however mostly are reconstructed one and during my visit also several spot are still under renovation.
4614,5.0,"Beautiful look into history with many buildings around the palace and a museum. Plan to stay about 1/2 the day there to explore everything. I must have taken 200+ pictures while there. Part of it was free then it was W10,000 ( $10 }"
4615,4.0,"We tour this place for around an hour. We interestingly watch the changing of guards, took some pictures with them, take a tour inside the palace.  A great place to learn the life of the kings in yesteryears - what each room consists of and looked liked."
4616,5.0,Interesting to visit to understand the culture of Korea. I joined the one hour free english tour guide provided at the location.
4617,5.0,It is a marvel that such a historical place is still standing in the middle of Seoul. The details of the building and the whole place is just grand.
4618,5.0,"Jinny was very clear with her explanations, and her jokes were funny! Grand and tragic at the same time. A must visit."
4619,4.0,"Guided tour organized by visit seoul web site provide tours in English, Mandarin or Japanese! Free of charge! However the palace is so large, it took 2-3hours for the tour."
4620,3.0,"The grounds at the palace are deceivingly large, so what we thought was going to be a 20 min walk through the palace turned into 90 minutes or so. This is another good site to see in order to get a picture of what life was like when... There is nothing extremely thrilling about this attraction, but there is quite a bit to see. Thought this was not a bad site, I would recommend this on a nice weather day."
4621,4.0,"Great place to visit, lots of interesting buildings and more of an interactive open space you could walk around. Huge complex with lots to see and great photo opportunities.  Only limitations is that there is a shortage of places to eat/drink (only came across one small cafe) and not enough information on the actual sites you are looking at"
4622,4.0,This palace is still under reconstruction but it's already worth a visit. Guided tours are free if your timing is right and are well worth your time to get a little bit of background. There are some particularly lovely views at the Northern end of the palace grounds.
4623,4.0,rich in culture and history. very interesting to listen to the lifestyle of the kings of yesteryears.
4624,4.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is easily reached via the Purple Line 5 Gwanghwamun Station. The prominent huge statue of Emperor Sejong watches you as you stroll past him at the Gwanghwamun Square towards the Gwanghwamun Gate. It is a good 500m walk from the station.  The 3 colourful guards in traditional Korean military outfits stood solemnly at the Gate as tourists posed photos with them. Don't miss the changing of the guards. The entrance fee to the Palace proper is 3,000KRW including free entry to the National Folk Museum at the back. The Palace is nothing spectacular if you compared with those in Beijing, China like the Summer Palace or Forbidden City. It is just wide and big open sandy ground with squarish traditional houses. Nothing colourful or interesting. It would be nicer during the autumn or cherry blossom season. We were there in late March and all trees shed their leaves and look so gloomy.  The National Folk Museum is more interesting as it showcases the history of the Korean culture. You should spend more time in the Museum than walking aimlessly in the big wide Palace ground unless you take the free tour which offers better insight of Palace. We did not take the free tour as we missed the timing. The other highlights are the pagoda and the traditional Korean houses around the Museum vicinity.  We existed through the National Folk Museum road entrance instead of walking back to the Gwanghwamun Gate. We original wanted to have lunch at Tosokchon for the ginseng chicken (nearer to the Gate side) but the Museum Entrance staff showed us a cross arms indicating not worth the walk back to the Gate. Instead, we walked to Insadong, about 15 minutes away."
4625,4.0,"The guard changing ceremony is really interesting and worth going to see. It happens a couple times a day. There is commentary in mandarin, English and Korean through the ceremony. The guards wear traditional dress which is awesome to see as it is very unique to Korea."
4626,5.0,Refreshing to eyeside. Never a dull moment. Lots of beautiful view. Prepare to do real walking. The place is huge. Really not to be miss place.
4627,5.0,"On a sunny spring day with the cherry trees in full bloom we toured the palace and were in awe of the sprawling magnitude of the palace grounds. I was particularly delighted with the many, many Koreans who dress in traditional clothing to visit the palace. It made it all the more enchanting."
4628,3.0,"Nice palace for a morning visit. Enter the palace via Gwanghwamun gate and try to time your visit to catch the Royal Guard-Changing Ceremony.  The palace was largely rebuilt and restored and it gives you an insight of the living area of the royal family, Joseon Dynasty."
4629,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgug is the best temple in Korea, close to central city and can make a nice half day trip to people staying in Center Seoul."
4630,3.0,"This is a larger park, most people rarely see the deep end of the park. Definitely worth visiting as the national midtown is right next to the castle."
4631,4.0,"There isn't much too see, but if you're on a date, you don't want the experience to just drag on and on. So in that sense, the palace is perfect. Many people prefer to go to Gangnam for dates, but I think Gyeongbokgung and Gwanghwamun area are much better as it is cleaner and more things to do.  Night-hours at the palace is also a sight to see, however, be warned of big crowd."
4632,5.0,This palace need no reservation prior to the visit. Tickets can be purchased outside the palace. English guided tour is highly advisable to thoroughly enjoy the palace and understand the history and story behind what really went on during the earlier days of Korea.
4633,5.0,I went there in Feb - in winter time. There is no flower at all BUT i can see the brownish scenery at park behind the palace which is nice to see and also can see the nearby hill (don't know the hill's name).. the cold n3ver bother me anyway..
4634,4.0,Was my third trip here in ten years but my first visit in late spring. Simply lovely. Especially enjoy the palace gardens at the back! The free guided tour that we signed up for made the visit even more enjoyable!
4635,3.0,"Interesting to visit, but after 30mins the kids were bored. There was a ceremony when we were there so it helped to spiced things up."
4636,5.0,Must come here to see and be in a moment as king and queen of this palace. Beautiful scenery especially during the spring seasons. Be sure to wear transitional Hanbok so can get free admission here.
4637,5.0,"Once you cross the great walls that separate the city from the temple, you will feel you are back in the 12th century. There are shows every once in a while. Korean things... it's a great place to visit. Also, it's very close to the old village and to a walking pedestrian street, very famous too, that I don't remember the name now!! But if you have the time: do it!"
4638,3.0,"Most of the palaces have been burnt down several times (being made of wood), so they are mostly replicas, and not very authentic when there is a concrete lintel across the roof...it wouldn't have taken much to hide the lintel under authentic roofing tiles. Also, you can't go inside most of the buildings due to their small size and fragility - 'wallpapered' floors wouldn't take too many feet pounding across them - so it's not like visiting a stately home in the UK!"
4639,5.0,"Excellent for those who love historical spots and this one is given the bonus of having the National Palace Museum right next to it (free entry). From the old map and looking at palace from a distance, one would feel as if it's back to Forbidden City. The stone ground, steps, carved balustrades, bronze urns, painted ceilings and eaves in main hall, etc etc. As a Kdrama fan, I can't help but get dizzy headed ! There are a few restricted areas but overall there's a good feel about exploring the inner grounds where many old trees survived. Particularly like the huge pavilion connected to a manmade lake. If you visit early or mid April, you get to see more blossoms.....I was lucky to catch a couple of plum blossoms. Time and patience is needed to cover the huge grounds."
4640,4.0,"Spacious palace, cold weather, windy.. That what i feel when i visited this palace. Surrounded by mountains... It so beautiful place to see. An ancient building with the history it self. Make this palace is one of must visit place in seoul."
4641,5.0,Beautiful place. You can feel the history the minute you walk in. Make sure you buy tickets ahead of time for the secret garden
4642,5.0,"Centrally located near Insadong, Bukchon Hannock Village, as well as several museums, this main palace from the Joseon Dynasty is a great place to start your day. There is a subway stop by the same name on line 3 and exit 5 brings you right up into the palace grounds. It's only 3kWon per person for entrance and there are free English speaking tours throughout the day. This is my favorite palace to take guests because there are so many options of places to go from there."
4643,4.0,"If you coming to Seoul. This is must be in ur itinerary. The palace is huge, it take about 1.5 hour to explore. It also have changing guard ceremony before ur enter the palace. if u want to see inside the palace, have to buy entrance ticket about 3,000won. Since this is my third visit to Korea. So i just watch the Guard Ceremony. it also take about 30 minute. after the ceremony end, we can take picture with the Guard."
4644,4.0,A very picturesque palace with a lot of great angles. Make sure to watch the changing of the guard ceremony. It is very colorful and veery photogenic.
4645,4.0,"Need at least 1.5 hrs to explore. Plenty of places to explore and take photos.  The guard changing ceremony is must see - to get the best view, stand at the top corner of the L shaped path where the procession will take place. You can get to see 2 sides of the ceremony."
4646,4.0,"If you're going to a palace, make this one your destination. Entrance fee is nominal and the place is huge. Crowds can get busy with all the tour groups. No food inside, and washrooms are hard to find so go prepared."
4647,5.0,"You could probably walk yourself around this monument with a guide book, but going with a tour guide had us there for the changing of the guard & little nuggets of information as we walked around."
4648,5.0,I had an opportunity to visit this palace. It's unfortunate that it was raining but I really enjoyed my stay.
4649,4.0,"This palace is huge, with loads to see!! The buildings are beautiful and the grounds are well maintained. You can see the ""changing of the guards"" which was pretty cool as well as being able to try on traditional Korean clothes for pictures. The palace was vey very busy - so i would suggest going early to try and avoid the mass crowds. My friends and I spent around 3 hours walking around this attraction"
4650,5.0,Be prepared to get lost in the palace without a map. My fiance and i visited the palace without a guide map and we got slightly confused after a while since most of the buildings look quite similar. The palace is picturesque all around and we loved taking a 1hour stroll within the palace.
4651,4.0,"A beautiful palace giving a glimpse into Korea's past. If you pay for a ticket you can enter and walk around. The trees were bare when we visited but I imagine they are beautiful when in bloom and even in the fall. Couples dressed in traditional clothing walking around make for great photos. If you don't want to pay, you can see some of it and the guard changing for free outside. We saw it at 2:00. They do not do it on Tuesday, and if I remember correctly the whole place is closed on Tuesday. Palace is right outside of an exit of the subway. There is a museum as well with a cafe outside and a cafe inside. A bit pricey for me. The palace is also next to the traditional village which makes for a nice walk and craft shopping - I recommend going to a cafe there afterwards."
4652,4.0,"Ticket entry is cheap compared to a site in the uk. There are plenty of toilets available and a coffee shop. There's plenty of space to move about although key areas i.e. at photo spots, it can get a bit crowded.  There are free tours in multiple languages available which are very well done and last about an hour, you can just turn up at the meeting spot inside the 2nd courtyard in at available times and join. Be prompt as they do go on time and are only 3x a day in English from what I could see.  You can see the changing of the guard for free but make sure you time it right or you'll miss it (check on website).  The cultural devastation by Japan over various occupations means this entire Palace has had to be rebuilt from scratch and none of it is the original palace from the 1500's. Japan actually shipped the entire crown princes wing of the palace to Japan where it burnt down in an earthquake in 1923, only the foundation stone was returned. Don't go expecting to see the original thing as it's not, only a replica from records. Saying that it's pretty impressive that they've managed to do the restoration they have.  It's a grest site and they are still working on some wings which have yet to be rebuilt. Expect to spend a full hour more exploring even after the tour.  You can exit out (and keep the ticket for re-entry) the rear gate to see the Blue House (the modern day korean presidents residence). Hint when you see loads of secret servicemen you'll know you're there...you can't miss them."
4653,4.0,"It's good to be back again. I came here on Winter time and this time with my daughter. I love watching ""changing guards ceremony"" and walking around this palace with Korean Traditional Dress ""Hanbok"". Just come to the information centre and tell them that you will going to use handbok during your visit here. They will help you. Don't forget to use your comfortable shoes.."
4654,3.0,"This is one of those places that you need to visit because it is one of Seoul's tourist attractions... It looks like a much smaller and less ornate version of the Forbidden Palace in China. If you visit here and want to go to the Bukchon Hanok Hillage, be sure to ask for directions as they are in close proximity... Since you are here, the National Folk Museum was also pretty good to see. That attraction was free..."
4655,5.0,"Nice soothing place... Must watch change of guard act, luckily was there at right time when it happened.... JetPrivilege number 201869242"
4656,5.0,"It is better to visit the palace early morning. Plan to arrive at the palace around 08;45, and watch around the palace and enter the palace premises by 09:00. After 10:30 more visitor will be there and miss the chance to get nice photographs. Dont forget the museum, where you can find more information on Korean Culture."
4657,4.0,"The palace compound is huge and you can spend a few hours walking slowly around it. There are gardes, a pavilion in the middle of the lake (though I think visitors are not allowed to enter the pavilion), living space of the royal family, etc. My friends and I studied the Korean history so we tried to tie everything to what we studied. One thing I would strongly recommended is to go with someone knowledgeable about this place or go with the tour as without them the buildings will be just another palace. You can always just take pictures of the area but to make the visit worth the trip having someone explaining things would be the better choice. Please check the operating hours too as I believe they close pretty early."
4658,4.0,I like this place. You can visit the museum first. It tells history of korea. Then visit the traditional palace and you can watch the traditional parade (i dont know the name) The location is nearby the blue house.
4659,5.0,Impressive glimpse into a once private royal residence. I highly recommend the brightly colored and musical changing of the guards. Any place along the rope will afford a good view. Each of the buildings you encounter are unique and the artistry of the beams and roofs are memorable.
4660,5.0,"One of the must see places of Seoul. All palaces are worth visiting, and this one is no exception. Guaranteed a nice visit!"
4661,4.0,Went here first thing in the morning. its a huge place so no worries even if there are many visitors. I enjoyed walking around taking in the fresh air and great sight. Was not able to witness the changing of guards but next time.
4662,4.0,"To me, travel to a new country and city should include a visit or more to the historic and cultural background of the city. We were fortunate to have been accompanied by a knowledgeable English speaking guide which made our two hour walk very meaningful and educational. Since we have visited many similar places in the world, I was impressed by the efficiency of the administration of the Palace."
4663,5.0,We were lucky enough to be there when this palace was open at night. That only happens 4 weeks during the year. The palaces were lit up beautifully and people were very respectful of the area.
4664,4.0,This is closed on Tuesday but the museum is open. Large and beautiful palace in the heart of downtown. A most see if you are downtown. Take the metro straight to it.
4665,5.0,I have been here twice already but I still see the charm. The place is very big and imagining how they lived before then it must be very grand. This place is very accessible riding a bus or a train and around this are other sites as well. History and Architectural lovers would love this.
4666,3.0,"Sorry to be negative here, but as a tourist visiting Seoul I found this very underwhelming, especially relative to other top cultural sites around the world.  There didn't seem to be any rooms to enter, statues to see, etc. it's just a very large palace spread out on a huge patch of dirt.  I would recommend going on a tour - otherwise i think you'll be quickly bored."
4667,5.0,"Appreciate the beauty and architecture of the Joseon dynasty. The biggest out of the palaces in Seoul .... the tour nearly killed off my feet. So be sure to wear really really really comfortable shoes.  Don't rush through it, stopover at the museums to know more about the korean culture. There's also cafes there .... if you need a break.  This tour was one of my favourites ...."
4668,5.0,"My first time here was in Sept 2014 before I came back again in Sept 2015. I followed an English complimentary tour guide the first time I was there. Really mesmerized by the scale of the whole palace. The tour was not 100% of the whole area since it was really big but it covered the necessary parts about the history of South Korea Kings. The view was really something to behold. The 2nd time I was there, I went to the National Museum beside the palace which I didn't manage to go the first time round. Given a choice, I won't mind coming again for the 3rd time."
4669,5.0,"The museum not to big, but have a nice story about Korean Ancestors and culture. We love to visit this places. The Palace somewhat similar China cultural in forbidden city."
4670,3.0,"it was fairly obvious from the start that the whole guard changing ceremony is performed by 'actors' - even the mustaches were obvious it was makeup. I was not very impressed by the whole ceremony - lots of banging and clanging and yelling. But see it if you are there.  The palace grounds are really spacious, but there's mostly barren since these are tourist places now."
4671,5.0,"A lot or tourist from around the world, the weather was very cold. Beautiful landscapes and i really love it."
4672,4.0,It was closed when we are there on Tues but it look stunning from the outer view itself. Detour to National Palace Museum of Korea just next to palace which is eye opening from knowing the history of Korea.
4673,4.0,"It was day beautiful when I visited. Perfect weather , nice sun . The palace is big and spacious. They eat time I visited a palace in Korea so a really good experience."
4674,4.0,A bargain for the entry price! Be sure to time your visit to see the changing of the guard which was spectacular. Worth walking all the way to the top of the park area to see the pond and other buildings.
4675,5.0,"Don't just look around the big palace, head up the hill to look around the older, smalller, more human areas. Much more evocative. My children loved the pool and oldest ( newly restored ) rooms. Korea has made her history come to life! Well done! My kids loved it."
4676,4.0,"This palace site (entry cost less than £3) is being extensively rebuilt, following the Japanese destruction of parts of the original palace during their C20th occupation However, the site is well worth including in your itinerary for Seoul as it is extensive and gives a powerful impression of the development of the Korean historical capital. The attached National Folk Museum is full of detail of historical Korean life and is both free and fascinating."
4677,4.0,"This place is huge, and in a cool area that's easy to get to by the Seoul Metro. Very historic and lots to do in the area when you are finished here. I would definitely go here if your in Seoul."
4678,5.0,"Visited in March, 2016. My only complaint, the water in the ponds were drained for the winter. Still a very impressive place to visit."
4679,4.0,"Been there on 12 March 16 last week, weather was cold but not short of tourist. The view was magnificent, and definitely breathtaking. One thing not to miss is the guard changing parade."
4680,5.0,Awesome palace. Very big. Nice architecture. Should go and visit but not recommended to stay the whole day as it's just while day of walking around. The guard exchange ceremony is awesome to stay and watch.
4681,5.0,"I fell in love with this place. If you plan coming to South Korea, you must visit this place. There's nothing better than historical places in this country."
4682,5.0,Great to spend 4 hours learning a bit more about korean culture and history. I found this really interesting. We joined the free walking tour which was probably the best decision as the guide was able to explain the difference between the buildings and piint out clever little things like the symbolic meaning of the number of animals on the roof beams and the innovative way the korean royalty kept their rooms warm in winter.  The palace is large enough that you wont feel crowded much. Bring some snacks or purchase outside so you have a drink while you wander around.
4683,5.0,"I've been here two times now, and I recommend going in good weather. The grounds are massive so it's really nice to take a few hours to walk around, sit down, look at all the buildings, etc  Watching the guards change is also cool (they do it at specific times)"
4684,5.0,Without a guide it is a stroll through a very interesting park. I visited as part of a VIP package tour while eating the goodies of Seoul. I would have totally missed this gem of a palace right in the middle of Seoul without expert knowledge guiding the way.  There is very little signage and didn't have an audio tour so without a guide you miss out on a lot of historical details of architecture and trees that literally date back to a different era. I would like to thank Daniel Gray and his company Delectable Travels for for arranging this excursion since I have visited Seoul often to eat and have seen many of the other sites before.
4685,5.0,Worth visiting a few times rather than trying to see it all on one day. I loved the smaller palaces and buildings in the back.
4686,5.0,"Be sure to arrive early in the morning to see the ceremonial change of guards. After that, have the opportunity to take photos with these guards standing straight and stiff - but please be careful not to touch them as it is unallowed. The whole place is big and you can have great photos captured at the different rooms within the palace, including the king's room, queen's, princes and many others!"
4687,3.0,"While you should see this palace, there is little information provided to guests without being in a third party tour group. It would have been nice to know what each of the buildings and structures were for for a glimpse into history and what life was like inside the palace walls."
4688,4.0,"Very extensive, beautiful and interesting. The only down fall is the 75 other tourists you are required to accompany on the guided Secret Garden portion of the tour (see pic). I would imagine that a small tour is the way to go next time. All in all it is worth a visit, just be prepared for and endless series architecturally stunning and recently painted empty buildings and complexes. It's surprisingly quite culturally bland."
4689,2.0,"I visited the palace with my partner and got bored too soon. There is not much to do inside the palace. Only a very few spots where you can get yourself clicked. I would not really recommend this site if you are seeking for some fun place and picnic spot to visit. But, if you want to tick one more destination on your checklist then go ahead and have a look at it. You might like it. Oh, and by the way there is a museum also which you can visit. But again, it was a disappointment too. Good luck!!! :) :)"
4690,4.0,this place used to be the seat of power to the old Korean kings. The entrance is cheap and they offer free English tour guides (check the guide schedule online). The palace is big and take sometime to see it all. also there are paid actors who act like old royal guards along with costumes and weapons and they do guard changing ceremony.
4691,3.0,Admission is extremely affordable at only a few thousands won. A nice place to bring visitors who are interested in history if not it can be generally boring as there is no activities or performances around the site.
4692,4.0,The Palace and the Museum is a good place to get to see the Ancient Korean Architecture but we must go along with a Guide else we might not understand anything.... Disappointing that entry into any of the Halls are restricted and Tourists can only see the Architecture from the Outside.
4693,5.0,"The palace is a great visit. A shame that you cannot go into the rooms, but still a great visit to see and experience a little how the royalties lived at that time. I also saw a few families with push chairs, so the facilities are definitely push chair friendly.  Do visit the museum as well, learned a lot about the history of Korea."
4694,3.0,"it is just architecture, certainly must checkout the time for guides if not you will miss a lot. I went in without a guide. There is a free guided tour in the information counter once in enter the palace one the right hand corner. They also give you free map. If you are not really keen of looking at the building, then maybe you can watch the exchange of guards. Or take pictures around the palace. Only cost 3000 won for tickets to go into the palace though. It will be great if you wear the hangbuk . good for photography. Met a few couples doing pre wedding there with traditional gowns."
4695,5.0,"Although not the prettiest royal palace in Seoul, it is a must-see because of the size and many other attractions within the palace. If you can do the evening tour, you are in for a very different experience which is also recommended. You cannot be disappointed with a tourist sight like this palace which summarizes the last Korean dynasty which lasted over 600 years."
4696,4.0,A grand n beautiful architecture. Free guided tour is provided. Can reach easily by bus and by subway. Worth for visiting!
4697,3.0,"It makes sense to go here. What you see, why and how you see it helps give backgound toand understanding of Korea and the culture"
4698,3.0,"In Korea ? Go see a palace - pap some pics and soak up some culture.  Nice 2hr stroll, bonus museum with some artefacts to scope out !"
4699,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is easily accessible by Metro as there is a stop dedicated to it. When you go up the steps, the vastness of the palace will welcome you. We didn't read up on the time of the changing of the guards but I think this is a nice thing to see. Entrance fee is W10000 I think for foreigners and you can wander about the huge palace grounds the whole day. Was amazed at the intricate design inside and outside the main palace. Also, it's amazing how all of these were preserved. Lots of clean restrooms inside the grounds. There's also a coffee shop where you can rest up. Definitely a must see when in Seoul!"
4700,4.0,"Nice view of the Palace from the hotel . So big to visit, and is a land mark for history lovers and Asian Architect seekers. See pictures ."
4701,3.0,"Never ceases to make me go whoaaaa..I just love how Seoul mixes old and new, modern and ancient so seamlessly."
4702,5.0,Great history in Korea represented by this palace. Plenty of space to walk in peace and enjoy the ambience.
4703,5.0,"Korea is so amazing, you cant leave seoul without coming to the palace. the guard change is worth it too, reminded me of mulan!"
4704,5.0,Gyeongbokgung palace is a huge palace in the touristic quarter of Seoul. It is really worth it. You can walk through the different parts of the palace and admire the wonderful architecture of the palace. If you plan to do other palace in Seoul I would advice to take a pass (which is available three months after purchase).
4705,5.0,"I've been to this amazing palace twice now. I can probably safely say I know my way around Gyeongbokgung Palace pretty well. But no matter how many times I see the same buildings or walk the same routes, I'm always amazed. Walking straight from the bustling, central city of Seoul into this amazing historical palace is quite mind-blowing. The atmosphere instantly changes. It really does feel like you've stepped back in time. With beautiful historic buildings, mountain backdrops, and lakes scattered throughout, you are guaranteed to get some of the best photos from your Korean holiday right here! In fact, my photos here were so great and professional looking, it inspired me to take photography seriously on my holidays. If you come here, you will never regret it. It is unique and special, the kind of place that is unique to this amazing country."
4706,5.0,"Close to the fantastics National Museum (free), while you need to pay a small fee to enter in main complex of Gyeongbokgung (worth the $). Plenty of people wearing traditional dresses, a traditional show, very nice palace, plenty of old style buildings, and even is possible to see a show with Korean guard, old style. Awesome. Just don't try the food on the national museum and go somewhere else for lunch, really bad. Easy to get ther by metro, has got a station 2 minutes from entrance of the palace and the natinal museum. Good choice to spend the whole morning."
4707,5.0,"Lucky to be present during the ceremony of changing guards. Epic and interesting, very inspiring view in the midst of the capital's skyscrapers."
4708,5.0,"Great place to walk around and soak in the history and atmosphere. Plenty of people, but also plenty of space to explore too."
4709,4.0,A guided tour is absolutely recommended since you could spend around 2 hours just walking around this place. It was amazing to see the vastness of the palace.
4710,4.0,"Beautiful, restored palace. Very reasonable entry fee that also includes the museum. Because we got there as soon as it opened at 9, we were able to walk the grounds with very few visitors and make it back to the gate for the changing of the guards by 10. So glad we started early because the tour buses started piling in as we made our way out."
4711,5.0,"There's a entrance fee charges to enter this place. Don't miss chances to tried out free costume before you enter the gate. Take picture for remembrance. Don't forget to take we-fie with guard in front of gate they wearing their traditional costume. There a few small palace located inside, walk and enjoy the beautiful scenery around the palace."
4712,5.0,Lots of photo ops. Very large open air sight. Weather will impact your visit. Dress accordingly if very cold. Beautifully re constructed.
4713,4.0,Many people flock to this palace and when you see it you realise why. For me it's a mini Forbidden City as far as the layout is concerned. A must see. Afterwards I walked to the Changdekgung Palace.
4714,4.0,"This palace is easy to reach from central Seoul and it costs only a few dollars to visit. Spend some time wandering around the lovely grounds and eavesdrop on the wisdom of a tour guide speaking your language, if you can find one. Based on the bits and pieces of various tour operators were heard, this place is rich in history, but even if you come uninformed, as we did, you will enjoy it all the same for its beauty."
4715,5.0,"and amazing value for money. If you just have a couple of hours to spend in Seoul, this is a great option."
4716,5.0,Wonderful large palace grounds with excellent access to the buildings. Can get a bit crowded with all the Chinese tour groups because the have 20-50 in each group but the grounds are huge so you can explore the architecture and history without too many folks crowding around. The Korean History Museum is highly recommended and very thorough in presentation of the history of the Korean people.
4717,5.0,"Very similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing, this site contains a complex of courtyards and different buildings, lakes and places where you can walk."
4718,5.0,"Visited this palace and couple of time whilst living in Korea. Lovely walk ways around the palace and beautiful views! Wouldn't visit in winter as doesn't look as nice without the pretty flowers and trees. It's right next to a subway station and if you walk out the main entrance there's a lot of bars and restaurants nearby, and also a nice stream. There's an English tour guide which you can walk around with at set times (check on website). I walked around for about an hour with the tour guide and then did my own things."
4719,3.0,"this was the main residence of the king back in the day, out of the 6 or so palaces in seoul. you can only go in the day time unless its a special season offering night tickets or tours. be sure to catch the change of guard ceremony"
4720,4.0,The whole area is vast and the palace is well preserved. Very detailed intricate designs on the walls and roof... So enchanting and makes you wonder how it was like to live in those palaces..
4721,5.0,This palace is like stepping back in time. You learn so much about Korean history and the architecture of this palace is gorgeous.
4722,3.0,Grand spot. Nice visiting. However the palaces are all similar and less nice than the Chinese ones.  Basically yes you have to go and see but don't expect much.  It is quite surprising to see the mix of modernity in a so small space.
4723,4.0,There isn't anything inside of this palace -- and the grounds are a bit dirty/muddy so wear appropriate shoes. It's sort of like the forbidden city if you've been to Beijng. There are many nice views as you walk around and the setting with the mountains in the background is really nice.
4724,4.0,"This place is pretty interesting. It is not a place that you would visit again and again, but it is one that should be visited a least just once if you are in the area."
4725,5.0,"A place of serenity in the hustle and bustle of Seoul. There are a couple of museums on site. If you are planning to visit the palace and the museums, you will need to allocate sufficient time."
4726,5.0,"Very large facility with different palaces of great beauty. Don t miss the Natioal Palace Museum of Korea (just outside the venue) and the National folklore Museum of Korea (you can access it free and then go back to the Palace just showing your entrance ticket). Both museums are worth a visit. The palaces on the venue are quite a stroll one from the other so take your time. The place was crowded on a cold Febrauary weekday, so I imagine it must be worse in the Summer. Many young ladies rent a Korean traditional dress to visit the venue, it is quite colourful. You can buy a combined 10,000 KRW ticket for all Palaces and Jongmyo Shrine."
4727,4.0,"This is a nice place ... Great and a lot of sad story but the building is nice we spend about 30 mins here , its too rush .I think 1-2 hour is good scenic view"
4728,5.0,"Insight of Korean history, way of living... Definitely take a guide, they will explain a lot of interesting details about this ""forbidden city of Korea"""
4729,5.0,You can't go to Seoul without visiting the palace. Beautiful and the parks are very well designed. So colorful. Totally recommend it
4730,4.0,A definitely must see in Seoul. The palace is wonderfully placed in an very modern area which gives it a splendid vibe. My friends and I were lucky to have witnessed the change of guards being in procession. It was an interesting sight to see.
4731,5.0,"Felt like I have transformed in time and went back to the old times where Korean Emperor, Empress, Princess exist. I want to one day wear the hanbok and take pictures here."
4732,3.0,"Positive: - huge places - all about Korean history - good place for picture - Flower season (April) - beautiful scenery  Negative: - Crowded with tourist, that will pushing you away from the place and cut queue etc"
4733,5.0,"One can walk around and see the grounds, but the guided tour turns it into an experience. One hour to walk through the palace grounds plus 90 minutes to experience the hidden garden. Spring and fall must be stunning. I went in February when landscape was dormant. Still with the time even though it was chilly out. Dress warm."
4734,4.0,"Arrived in time to catch the changing of the palace guard ceremony at 10am in the square in front of the ticket booth. Make sure to keep your ticket, as you will need to show it if you exit then re-enter the grounds for the adjacent National Folk museum of Korea. The rear gate leads out to catch a distant view Cheong wa Dae, the presidential Blue House."
4735,4.0,"Plenty of walking around,clean about there and lots of history. Private guide made this very interesting"
4736,4.0,"Went there late afternoon and watched the change of guards before going into the palace. There were a few tour groups, but not crowded. And once you step away from the centre and wander to the side, you get a really nice feel about this place.  There are many young Korean girls and boys wearing traditional dress and costume and having a great time taking photos. Great place for people watching."
4737,4.0,"While not as grand as the Forbidden City in Beijing, Gyeongbokgung makes up for it with fewer crowds, clean air, and a beautiful mountain backdrop. My friend and I enjoyed exploring the lesser populated nooks of the palace, as well as the lake surrounded pavilions. Make sure not to miss the changing of the guard at 2PM as it was rather spectacular, with guards dressed in old gear marching heroically along the gate to traditional pipe music. Very cool."
4738,5.0,"This palace from the Joseon Dynasty was awesome! The price of the ticket was reasonable ($10 US) and it also including the Korean folk museum, which was by far the best museum I went to in Korea! We waited for the English speaking tour at the front. I would highly recommend the free guided tour!! I wouldn't have enjoyed this place as much as I did without the tour guide. She gave some really good insight and background history that was compelling as you walking around the grounds and visited the different areas of the palace grounds. The guided tour is about an hour or so. We also visited the museum which was included in the price. Go there as well. It was awesome!! It has some spectacular displays with life size depictions of Korean traditional ways of life and past history. It also had a Korean food history area as well which was fascinating too. Overall, I am very happy we went to Gyeongbokgung Palace! A highlight of our trip."
4739,4.0,"Great couple of hours, some good photo opportunities especially the guards on the gates. Close to main centre of town"
4740,5.0,"If you're a fan of sageuk (Korean historical drama), make it a point to visit Gyeongbokgung palace. For just 3000 won for adults and 1500 won for kids, you get to know more about Korean history and bask in the majesty of the palace and the various halls around it."
4741,5.0,The view of the mountain at the back of the palace is just stunning. The Gyeongbokgung palace is three minutes walk from the subway station. I spent my two hours going around the palace. They have started the changing of guards by 11am. I walker around the area instead of just seeing the palace itself. Lovely view! there is a museum on the same area which has a free entrance. It's definitely worth a visit!
4742,5.0,"Of you want to feel like a movie star, wear a hanbok, go to the palace. The traditional dress is beautiful. When my friends and I arrived we were bombarded with requests to take photos with people. It was surreal. The palace itself is beautiful. Lots of information is available about the historical significance of Gyungbukgoong in the Korean capital"
4743,4.0,Crowded with tourists. There's ticket charge but we were lucky enough because we payed a visit on the day which is not charging for the ticket. I got to see so many pretty korean girls with hanbok.
4744,4.0,"We spent about 2 hours exploring the grounds. It's a sprawling palace, so go with good walking shoes."
4745,3.0,"Its a must visit, cos its very much part of Korean history. Location is perfect, near US embassy and busy intersection. Free English tour and you can sit in the park and relax if you must. My son who was an exchange student there took me around, so I knew not to expect much out of this 'palace'. Click a picture with the guards outside if you like and the big statues of the King on the pavilion outside"

4747,5.0,I went on a tour of Gyeongbokgung Palace and it was amazing! I learned about the architecture and culture of Korea while learning about the history of the country. The palace is beautiful and offers a wonderful step back into history while one is completely surrounded by modern buildings.
4748,5.0,"Make sure you join the 11am free english tour. Very informative and the best part it is free. Get to connect this with the gwahamun square, king sejong statute, admiral yi and the folk arts museum tour which are all interconnected."
4749,4.0,"If you have a few hours to admire nature and old buildings, do visit the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Be ready to walk though because the place is huge! You may want to come early to witness the changing of the guards at palace grounds at 10am and also play dress up with traditional royal guard costumes."
4750,5.0,"Hi. I was at this site on October 22, 2015. It's an amazing place which records the history of an important period of Korea history. The empire history. There are a lot of wonderful buildings with its old art and very special coloring and painting. Specially the throne Hal and the Emperor Hal and rooms. Also there are many statues and gargoyles. And many girls wearing the traditional clothes."

4756,4.0,A place that must be visited in Seoul. You can sense the historical values as you walk in to this palace. Well preserved and interesting historical architecture.
4757,5.0,"If you wanna get nice pics of you and your friends in Seoul, this is one place to go. Make sure you go there on a good bright day, to get Instagram-worthy shots.  There are always kids wearing traditional garbs, and they'd be more than happy to take pictures with you, which is nice.  There is a big famous square right in front of the palace get, and you can continue the photo sessions there."
4758,4.0,"The photos speak for themselves. It was an enjoyable experience. A must see for those interested in Korean traditions, history and culture."
4759,3.0,Seoul has the most amazing temples. This one was my favourite it was set out with a lake front with its reflection glittering off the surface. The architectural design of the temple was amazing with such detail put into each area of the temples it was truly outstanding.
4760,5.0,"Entrance fee was 3000 Won for adult, I somehow get a black and white guide book at the admission counter at 500 Won, don't do it, by you can get a briefer colorful version inside the second gate. Also there is a National Palace Museum of Korea which you can enter from the palace. If you want to go inside the museum, and walk around the palace a bit more, make sure you get back into the palace before 16:30 hrs. Otherwise, they won't let you get back into the palace again. The palace close at 17:00 hrs."
4761,5.0,"I loved all the palaces in Seoul, but this one absolutely exceeded all expectations. Well preserved and stunning architecture - colorful buildings with many interesting details. Beautiful gardens. Need few hours for a visit."
4762,4.0,"Easily accessible attraction. Short walk from Gyeongbokgung station. There are many photo opportunities in the palace. Move further in there is another Korea Folk Village inside Gyeongbokgung Palace, free admission. I find the Korea Folk Village better than Gyeongbokgung.  There are also free costume rental (5 mins) for you to wear and take photo near the Gyeongbokgung entrance. Limited pax for each time slot.  Do stay for the guard changing ceremony. There are also free guided tour in the palace. Please check their website for more details."
4763,5.0,"We did the Secret Garden tour which was quite funny (""you have 3 minutes until we move on""!) and pretty interesting. The gardens were covered in a light dusting of snow as we were there in January and the stream was frozen, it was very pretty"
4764,5.0,"Maybe it was the fact that this was a somewhat spontaneous visit without detailed planning and we happened to hit it at the perfect time that the changing of the guard was starting, which was exactly when we arrived. Maybe it was that the weather was bright, sunny and perfect. I think it was more than that. This place felt magical. There was a peaceful presence that can't be explained but we both very much enjoyed it. I found the free English speaking tour also enjoyable and informative helping to bring me up to speed on the Joseon Dynasty. If I had one complaint, it was that the English speaking tour guide had a quiet voice and the sound system didn't help her much. The site is beautiful and historic and not to be missed in Seoul."
4765,3.0,"It was the first day of the korean new year, hundreds of people flowing out of the underground to the palace- because it is free. The palace suituated right at the stop .There was a traditional dance going on, music with drums and a simple dance with people in hanbok. Then go into the musemun for a walk, it is well organised and worth a look.Insadong is situtated not far away so spent sometime there as well."
4766,2.0,"This palace basically composes of many temples, pagodas and more standing on sand. It just looks like an abandoned desert. They don't let you go into the palaces, so there's not much to see from the outside. The similar characteristics of different palaces and the lack of background information makes it a tourist site that is not recommended. Remember to follow a guided tour to have a better understanding of the functions of different structures. Or else you will find your visit boring and meaningless."
4767,4.0,"A beautiful main palace in Seoul. Several attractive shows are : the changing of Guard, the children museum (One of shooting location of Daehan Minguk Manse when they visit palace and Minguk get annoyed by the Train driver :D). The area is huge, so it's better to spare around 2 hours,especially if you bring many friends. The buildings're typical,but pretty. Not forget to mention the small lake located inside."
4768,5.0,"Very large grounds with various out buildings. Seoul is such a modern city that there is very little that is ""old"" so it is a nice change of pace."
4769,3.0,"The palace itself was quite large with many separate sub-palaces. There was not many things to see within each small palace. However, the architecture was quite nice and great setting for photo taking if that is what you are into. There is a huge garden behind the palace. However, we could not afford the time to cover that."
4770,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is truly an amazing place. Once you get there, you will definitely picture out in your mind the setting of the King's feast, gatherings, important events and various historic activities that happened hundred years ago. It is such a wonderful and well-preserved tourist spot in Seoul. Though hundreds of people visit the place everyday, the people of Seoul makes a great job keeping the place clean and tourists friendly."
4771,4.0,"One of the main palaces in Seoul that every tourist should visit. The Changing of Guards, the Main palace and the grounds are a must see. You should wear thou a comfy pair of shoes since the area is wide. Great photos of the place are unlimited. Not recommended on small kids since they may not enjoy the whole experience."
4772,5.0,We went to the Palace and the secret garden. It snowed for a short time and it was magical.The tour guide was excellent and we had an amazing time.
4773,5.0,"A beautiful structure that has been well-preserved and highlights the beauty of the ancient Korean dynasty that shaped the modern society to where it is today. Fascinating folk museum is right beside this palace and it is in reach of Insa-dong (the shopping area), restaurants and other interesting places, too."
4774,3.0,"I have been living in Korea for a few years now and am not particulary impressed with a lot of the temples in Korea. Most are not original and the result of mass reproduction. However, if you're going to see any temples, i'd suggest this one. Its one of the largest, with beautiful grounds, particularly in the sping and summer . The ticket prices are also very cheap to enter."
4775,5.0,A place that you can find traditional korean culture. Hanbok wearing is fee of charge to get in.
4776,5.0,"Came here during the lunar new year. Entrance fee is free as its a holiday. So maybe if you do not want to pay for he entrance fees then go during holidays time. However no guided tour is conducted. Think it's because of the holidays, there is also stalls set up for both adults and children to make craft, eatery, writing wishes. Went to children's museum- if families travelling with children, it's another place can go and experience some of their games and play."
4777,4.0,"It was my first time in Korea, I love everything I've seen. Hopefully, I will have a chance to be there again."
4778,5.0,Awesome place to go! You can see historic palaces and watch the changing of the guards. You can even rent a hanbok here and imagine you are apart of the history there.
4779,5.0,"The palace is so big and full of traditionally scenic paintings in its walls, attic, and rooms. From the tour guide, we could hear explanation regarding the reign and fall of the dynasty. We also could understand on how the relationship of the royal family and their warrior as well as their workers. On the palace yards we also could see digital brief explanation on the development of Korean people from the early stages in a museum, and we also could try playing traditional children game i.e. Circling a Top with skin-band, running a thin wheel with its steel guider, pointing steel-head wooden arrow to small steel basket, a swing, see-saw as well as playing a 'Katepok' (shuttle cock like game) with our ankle. This is great to reminding our children of the old fashioned game apparatus. The most interesting is the Palace provide us with traditional Royal Hanbok clothes for taking picture as a King and Queen of the day. We could also see how the traditional meals are cooked and served on the digital explanation in the Culinary museum nearby the Children museum in the Palace yard. By taking boxes of certain kind of meals from the cupboard, screening the barcode on the media, and we could see the meals prepared, cooked and served on the screen in front of us."
4780,5.0,It is an outdoor experience so I wouldn't recommend it to families with young kids. It is still amazing to find out about how the history was built in Kore.
4781,4.0,Nice to wander around and to check that box. The changing of the guard is the most interesting part.
4782,5.0,We arrived here a few minutes before 1 p.m. and were lucky to be in time for a FREE English speaking guided tour with the low price of paid admission. Allow at least 1 hour and wear comfortable shoes. HIGHLIGHT was all the other visitors from other Asian countries who wore special clothing gowned clothing to their tour and we took photos with all of them
4783,5.0,Just a short walk from the Gyeongbokgung subway stop on the #3 line. Take exit door 5. You can spend a day touring the palace grounds and enjoying the museum. Seniors can enter without paying a fee.
4784,5.0,My friends and I have this in our itinerary and I'm glad we did it. This Palace is so huge that I suggest that you should wear the most comfortable walking shoes you have! The entrance fee for the Palace is 3000 won and there is an additional fee for the secret garden. There's also a coffee shop in the middle of the Palace where you can rest and drink some tea. They also sells some souvenirs.
4785,5.0,I whish come here once a time 'cause I love historical places and because of that I love Korea and living there.
4786,5.0,"If you have a chance to visit this palace, or I think you must visit while you are in Seoul. Guardian Exchange ceremony and Wearing Korean tradional costume are good to have experience."
4787,4.0,This is a pretty impressive palace even if it has been reconstructed after centuries of destruction. Great layout and reconstruction but it gets extremely busy so go early
4788,4.0,"You can spend hours here, walking around, lapping up the grounds and buildings. It is really mesmerising to be immersed into the past, with huge skyscrapers towering over one side of the grounds, and mountains at the other.  There are English speaking tours available at certain points of the day, and you can also watch the changing of the guard, which is pretty cool.  The only reason I gave 4/5 is because if, like me, you have seen many temples in Korea, they all begin to look the same ha! This is definitely one of the very best to visit though - a must see for anyone exploring Seoul!"
4789,4.0,"The area is big. But most of the building is closed. So much to see, only outside of the building. The only building we could see inside is the Throne, but the dragon on the ceiling is nice. There is a museum inside which has a nice display."
4790,5.0,"As I was born and raised in Seoul for 22 years, I can't be more proud of this beautiful palace of my city. I can surely recommend this place for who you are, where you from, and what you're looking for."
4791,4.0,"nice palace, to visit, you can see amazing korean architect. at the gate there are dressed up Guards- try to catch the changing of the Guards. there is also small village at the end of the place to see the tradition life of ancient korea"
4792,5.0,The palace provides visitors with a strong flavour of Korean history and culture. Let the guides take you on an extraordinary history lesson.
4793,4.0,"Our family really enjoyed the visit to the palace. Glad we joined the free volunteer guided tour which helped us learnt more about the palace, than just touring the surrounding. The palace is really huge, from outer court, to inner court, to every little corner of the palace, it tells us so much about how the royal family lived in the olden days. The tour guide was very patient and explained in great details of how the emperors lived, how the palace was managed, and how the princes/ princesses were brought up outside palace. We learnt a lot through this visit, and fell in love with Korean culture even more :) A must visit place, for someone who loves history - like me :)"
4794,5.0,Had a really good time here. Do wait and stay for the change of guard parade. Tradiotional korean costumes and drums.
4795,5.0,"We love to see the palace especially since we watched Korean dramas a lot. The admission fee was not expensive too and we really enjoyed ourselves there to see the rooms, structure, and architecture of the palace.  Awesome place for tourist!"
4796,3.0,This place would look eerie and sad during winter. I've seen photos of this temple during spring and it was beautiful! I would prolly go back some other time when the flowers and trees are in bloom!
4797,4.0,Definitely a must go to if you are a traveler visiting Seoul. Not too much to do though- you just walk around and look at the buildings and cant go inside them.
4798,4.0,A large and beautiful palace complex in the heart of the historic district of Seoul. To make the most of the visit you must take your take to absorb the beautity of the place and understand its history. Large enough to spend several hours and be sure to catch the changing of the guards as well!
4799,4.0,We came at a very untimely visit. Temp is at -18. Can't feel my hands and my face. But the cafe located near the palace is great. Great souvenir items. You can buy a book if you're a bookworm.
4800,5.0,"I visited this palace several times during my stay in Seoul actually but in August I had my favorite experience with an exclusive night visit! The park and main buildings are the most beautiful in my opinion and its location makes it the center palace even if Changdeokgung is supposed to be the biggest and most important one. I especially love the building surrounded by a lake next to the main one and in the park behind, the little tea house is just too cute for words. I totally recommend going there at night if you can catch the special events they're doing for this opportunity and coming at different season as well."
4801,4.0,"We visited on one of the free airport tours. We had a great guide who gave us some great information, but we were a bit exhausted to take it all in. I did enjoy the beautiful buildings (especially the colourful roofs), and the peaceful grounds. Definitely recommend a visit."
4802,5.0,"I went here because it was #1 on TripAdvisor's list for Seoul. I managed to arrive just as an English language tour was starting.  The guide was knowledgeable and pleasant but she didn't really encourage questions. Of course it was cold and windy outside so that may have affected everyone.  The tour and the overall exhibit are all outside so the weather on a particular day may affect your appreciation.  I felt that I learned a lot of Korean history, especially the story of the invention of the Korean alphabet. Well done!"
4803,5.0,"This place is for those seeking peace and serenity yet has a knack for Culture and History. Magnificent structure, no longer 100% original yet eloquently restored. It speaks a lot of the Korean ancestries' creativity and style. Learned a piece of their history even for a short span of time. Didn't know even the pavements speaks how they protect their royals."
4804,5.0,"If you are in Korea on vacation, you should definitely visit Gyeongbok Palace. Even if you live in Korea it is a great place to visit in the spring and fall."
4805,4.0,"I went on the Seoul Historic Tour through Koridoor tours on the weekend. I was going to like traditional Korean places, so it was so much fun.  First, I went to the Jogyesa Buddhist temple, and I could understand of Korean Buddhism. There were also a bunch of great flower-decorations It was nice to see the temple in South Korea, and then we went to gyeong bok palace. Tour guide was explaining to us about Korea Choseon dynasty which was so impressed.  We went to national folklore museum and then we went to the blue house and sa-rang chae.  It was exciting to see all the presidents from the very first and currently one.  I would love to go there again, when my friends visit to Korea next time.  Thanks Koridoor Tours!!!!"
4806,3.0,Thsi is a great place to learn about korean history if you didnt know.  There is a english tour around the premises for tourists and the tour guide speaks good level amount of english  its quite big but also you can go up close to some palaces and look inside- very interesting! i recommend visits! :)
4807,5.0,You must visit. Strongly Recommend. Beautiful sight and palace. No need to explain. Only 3$ closed every tuesday
4808,5.0,"I'm kind of a nerd for this stuff, but I really enjoyed touring the palace and watching the attendants reenact the guard changes and things. It's easily accessible through the metro, so if you're being a tourist in the city you have no excuse! But really... why would you want to miss this magnificent place for free anyways? The courtyard costs nothing to enter, and that's where the aforementioned reenactment occurred. Next to the palace is also the National Folk Museum of Korea (With FREE entry [which I separately reviewed]), which adds a little depth in exploring the history of this rich culture!"
4809,5.0,"If you can explore it for the day, try, its a lot of rooms. I have gone to China to see palaces, but this one had so many functioning rooms. We laughed as we walked recalling the Korean Dramas and we understood what ""living outside the palace"" meant. tons of rooms, different levels.. and adorable"
4810,4.0,A must visit place in Seoul! Amazing architecture and nice walk in the palace! Enjoy the dynasty feel and historic building.
4811,5.0,Wintertime is probably not the best time to visit but if it is your only option this palace is recommended. I thought this was the loveliest palace in Seoul. Due to limited time and it being a very cold day we only saw a small portion of the palace grounds. It is recommended that you bring cash to pay for the entrance fees as the credit card machine was not working the day we visited. We visited on New Years Day and there were many visitors. After visiting this palace walk south to visit Gwanghwamun square.
4812,5.0,The palace grounds were a sight to see. If ever in Seoul I think it's a must. In a city that is full of innovation it's good to see where all can from. The grounds are vast and you are able to roam freely. The structures and mountains in the distance are ideal for pictures. And anyone of any age would enjoy this visit.
4813,4.0,"This was my first time to visit Korea, especially its capital city, Seoul. I wanted to explore by myself, but I didn't know where to start. So I looked it up and found good tour called 'Seoul Historic Sights Tour' provided by Koridoor. It was a small group tour with a group of 5. During the tour I have learned a bit of Korean History and the current Korea. Tour included one of buddist temples and the main palace then Blue house. It was great. Thanks to nice tour guide from Koridoor, I spent my time efficiently in seoul."
4814,5.0,Highly recommend visiting this stunning palace. Spend hours walking through the living quarters and palace grounds. The changing of the guard is also a must see.
4815,5.0,"Both of the times I have visited Gyeongbokgung Palace, the guided tours have been wonderful. The tour guides are funny and very well informed, and the traditional outfits they wear are beautiful. The guards out front keep a straight face even when you're taking pictures, and they look great. The palace itself is beautiful, and definitely worth the visit! Definitely wear sunscreen if you visit on a sunny day though!"
4816,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung is a huge palace in Seoul. Do cater for more time time to explore the palace. Join in the complementary tour to gain more insights into the various parts of the palace. Join in a tour of the secret garden in this palace, spaces are limited for this secret garden tours daily."
4817,5.0,I love the Changing Guard Ceremony. Very lovely place and tour guides really hard to provide best services. Love it!!
4818,4.0,"A guided tour early in your visit to Seoul gives a basis and understanding of the history and culture of this proud nation. Easy to access and to move around, I appreciated the explanations of features I was given."
4819,4.0,"I joined the trip and english tour guide accompanied myself during the trip. From her explanation, i can learn many things about korean histories. They are also on the way to renew and rebuild the building,since some of them destroyed several times based on the history. It is a must have place if you visit seoul."
4820,5.0,Loved this place. Beautiful palace. Watch the changing of the guards at 10am if you can. Can easily spend a few hours here. Very peaceful.
4821,5.0,"Visited this palace just two days ago and had a great experience. When I arrived, I was not allowed inside and quickly realized that I had gotten there just in time for the changing of the guards. It was a great site to see. I wish I had done the tour, but was satisfied that my admission allowed me inside the National Folk Museum."
4822,5.0,"I joined the Seoul Historic Sites Tour on yesterday, 20, Nov. It was so great time for me to learn about interesting history about Seoul. We went to Jogyesa Buddhist Temple and our tour guide, Haley explained about many concepts about Buddism and the palce as well. Visitng Gyeongbok Palce is one of the best moments for yesterday. Haley explained really well about Korean, especially Seoul histories, legends and even scret stories of each builidings and many things around there. Also, I felt like being in Chosun Dynasty when i was seeing the Royal guard change ceremony. The palaces and whole palace area looked sooooo beautiful it almost looked like a huge beautiful garden in the middle of this big city. So, this tour made my day yesterday and i want to join another tours which i could learn more about Korean culture and history."
4823,5.0,"There are a number of palaces in Korea, but this is the best of the best. It is the largest and is beautiful. They offer a daily changing of the guard show right inside the gate (free), but there are a lot of great photo ops and it is a wonderfully quiet place to enjoy, away from the noise of Seoul."
4824,5.0,You just have to come here. It's one of the most picturesque places I have ever been in... Try to come early to avoid the crowds
4825,4.0,"Unfortunately most of this palace was destroyed so it's been rebuilt within the last 100 years. Although it's not 'original' it's very interesting and picturesque. We visited in the afternoon and got some amazing pictures at dusk. It's quite spread out so plan to be there for a few hours. There's a free walking tour in various languages at different times, I highly recommend it!! We arrived part way through the changing of the guard which was a bit of a bummer as its really theatrical. If you go look up the times and don't miss it."
4826,5.0,"The grounds and buildings are very well maintained - especially the gardens and detail paint work on the buildings, making you feel like your stepping back in time. The changing of the guards is a must see ceremony with the traditional uniforms that the guards are wearing."
4827,5.0,"For history lovers, this place is perfect for you. So many beautiful palace and its scenery. This place is so big, be sure to have a lot time to walk around this area."
4828,5.0,Beautiful palace in Northern Seoul. Don't miss the daily changing of the guards ceremony. Entrance to the adjacent folk museum is also free and worth a visit
4829,4.0,Gyeongbokgung place is the best attraction for first time visit. It is located in the center of Seoul. Convenience transport and cheap admission fee.
4830,4.0,You much visit all palaces in Seoul. Palaces are must watch. The structure and the piece of art is something that you will admire. It is very peaceful place.
4831,5.0,"Once you've visit Seoul. Do not forget to visit this palace. It's the best. There are some more interesting inside too, eg. National Palace Museum, Korea National Folk Museum, Korea National Children Museum."
4832,4.0,"Very touristy yes but since this palace was like in the middle of city, it's kind if stepping back to old time. The must seen was the changing guard scene. The palace quite big spend like 2-3 hours there's a lot things to be seen if u into the culture type if not about 1 hour should be enough."
4833,4.0,"Even in the freezing winter days, this palace is still a worty place to visit. Quite a big ground to cover, its interesting to see inside the museum and when you re lucky enough they will open some of the palace doors to let you see whats inside. Its not much, but still interesting."
4834,4.0,"Though this palace is worth visiting, I need to remind anyone who wanted to visit the sight should really wear enough clothes. The palace is not surround by any tall buildings so is cold inside.  As for the free tour guide provided by the palace is good. One should go there if interested in Korean culture.  Most important the guards exchange ceremony is something you dont want to miss. If you dont have enough time to enter the palace, do drop by to the exit of the palace and watch the ceremony. Is really traditional!"
4835,5.0,"Very large and well-maintained complex with multiple living areas, temples and garden areas. Worth visiting if only for the lovely large lake and wooded areas !"
4836,5.0,"I love the changing of guards, I'm curious if they put make-up in their face and if their beards were true. And one thing, the guards and the police in Seoul are cute, do you agree with me guys?"
4837,2.0,If you have free time in Soul you can visit for one hour ..but you should be careful about the weather
4838,5.0,The palace devided into many parts. You can start from the main gate or from another entrance. The pavillion and all royal resident are really nice. You can walk arround and relax at some corridor. You can explore the palace within 2 hours or more.
4839,5.0,Gyeongbokgung Palace is just amazing and was the definite highlight of our trip. There is a free English tour and our tour guide was really lovely and she talked us through the history of the palace and kept our group of around twenty people interested.
4840,5.0,"Try to read up a bit before going there because most of the information board/sign was shown in Korean. Overall, worth a try ! 3000 KRW entrance fee for Adult."
4841,4.0,"I've seen a lot of palaces in my life. This one is nice, nothing special about it. Of course that doesn't mean it's not nice...  The buildings are very nice to look at and you can imagine the work needed to carve and paint it."
4842,4.0,"a lot of stories happened in this palace, i did the search for my luck , the place needs a Guide , you pay for the entrance also and remember doing the tour in the Palaces in SEOUL, take your Hat with you to kill the sun"
4843,5.0,"Some will tell say that there are other Joseon palaces in Seoul that are prettier than Gyengbukgong, but it is the biggest, grandest, and the archetype fr all others. The grounds with the various buildings are enormous, and we find new nooks and crannies every time we go. Make sure you leave time to visit the palace museum and folk art museum adjacent to the palce grounds."
4844,5.0,Be prepared to walk for miles. This place is huge and beautiful. Lots of history in this place. You just have to be patient since they are spread apart. It is like a small city in a city.
4845,4.0,It is interesting to see some of the palace building structure was built small and short older days and the interior was very detailed and colorful. The area is huge and do have your lunch before you go as you may need at least 2 hours to cover the whole area.  Do ask the taxi to stop you at the main entrance not the side entrance to save time. There are a few modern buildings near the main gate to explore.
4846,4.0,Definitely worthwhile to spend an hour or two visiting and take a break from all that shopping. You should try to sync your visiting time to catch the guards changing performance and follow through with a free guided tour of the palace.
4847,5.0,The Gyeongbokgung Palace was so beautiful. My family and I were lucky to be able to visit the palace in the autumn. All the autumn leaves added even more beauty to the scenery.
4848,5.0,I really loved the palace! The museum was really great. The show in the front courtyard of Palace was cool! Totally recommend. Very educational and tons of history.
4849,4.0,"It is an eye opening to see the former Palace for the Joseon dynasty ruler. Though there are not many things to see within the inside those palace buildings, at least we can appreciate how the Korean wanted to preserve part of their heritage . The present day Gyeongbokgung had been rebuilt due to fires during the Imjin Waeran Japanese invasion 1592 -1598 and systematic destruction by the Japanese colonial govt from 1910 to 1945."
4850,5.0,"We got to the palace just as they began the changing of the guards ceremony. If you have the chance to see that, it's worth a wait. Behind the walls there are a lot of buildings, many of which are similar in design/structure -takes a while to walk around but I enjoyed seeing the traditional Korean buildings set against a beautiful mountainous backdrop on one side and the city skyline of Seoul on the other."
4851,5.0,"Whether it's your first trip to Seoul or you've been several but have never fit a trip to Gyeongbokgung Palace you have to visit. If you've been but never during the night, go again. The night views are the things postcards are made of. See the shows - we saw a drum exhibition. Excellent!!"
4852,5.0,"There aren't many historical sights in Seoul honestly, but this is the main palace and one worth seeing. The guards staring straight ahead is a cool sight to see, and especially when the guard come out and do their routine. Cheap admission fee and a lot of space to walk around through. Go experience!"
4853,4.0,"This is an excellent place to visit for a good outdoor walk while taking in the sights of the beautiful palace. We loved all its colors and the views of the buildings with the hills in the background. It's only 3000 won per person, including the folk museum, so it's absolutely worth it!"
4854,4.0,"Taking a metro would be the best way to reach Gyeongbokgung Palace, although I had some difficulty checking the right metro , & language is one of the obstacle. But I had a good time watching the parade, & drum performance - it's worth to spend 2-3 hours getting around . It's huge so take your time to take pictures of the Palace & surroundings. Bring some snacks or fast food. I enjoy visiting the Palace."
4855,5.0,"Fee apply. If you happen to visit, do spend more time here. The place is BIG that require a lot of walking."
4856,4.0,There are too few cultural offerings in Seoul. And that is a pity. This is a work in progress and one that should be visited when in Seoul. Guided visits are particularly instructive and educational. This is definitely a beautiful monument that marks the history of the country. Go see it.
4857,4.0,"Love these historic sites, but the Northern Palace is severely lacking in signage. I suppose this is to help promote their tours and guided visits, but as a visitor who likes to independently wander, this leaves me with a sense of ""...huh?"" Nonetheless, I love that it's not crowded, and also very inexpensive (3000 KRW only, or about $3 USD). The Folk Museum admission is also included. Note to self....Perhaps I should have opted in for the tour...."
4858,5.0,Our family enjoyed the beautiful palace. We went on a weekday so it wasn't so busy and to my amazement there's free wifi :) on the property
4859,4.0,"Stunning relic, beautifully preserved. If visiting in winter, wear rain-appropriate footwear. Allow more time to inspect the exhibits in the Folk Museum, which is situated inside the palace."
4860,4.0,If you're interested to know more about traditional Korean culture and experience the 'feel' of the olden Korean times then this is definitely worth a visit.
4861,4.0,"Nice day out to walk around the palace grounds. I find the explanation a bit lacking. If you did not have a guide, you would not be able to appreciate as much of the history"
4862,5.0,"Very huge palace, so prepare yourself for the next 2.5 hours to go around the palace. Beautiful, and I love the attraction they have for changing guard."
4863,4.0,"We were late after a long walk from the bus station and could only see the last minute of the changing of guards. Already worn out, we only took some pictures with the guards standing there and walked in a little to get the feel. A place worth to explore more and we shall come again on our next trip to Korea."
4864,5.0,do visit for a glimpse of korean palace history. I enjoyed the hour long palace guided tour tremendously. do check for the various timings available.
4865,5.0,The palace is so full of history and the Korean culture is so interesting. I spent half of day capturing it through my camera lens and could have spent another day.
4866,5.0,"The entrance fee is just $3000 Won. Very big had a few toilet which was very convenience for such a big palace. We meet two Korea ladies who also came to take photo in their nice Korea clothing, they are very friendly and we also took some photo with them. We have a fruitful outing to the palace."
4867,5.0,"They offer free tours several times a day. One might have a little problem understanding the guides English pronnounciation. Otherwise, it is a beautifull palace."
4868,2.0,"The palace is old and as advised by the tour guide, many areas were destructed in wars and the remains were not as grand as before. The place is not too large and touring can be done in an hour or so. However as the most popular tourist spot in Seoul, seems a must go. Don't miss out the change of guard every hour near the front gate. You can also walk to the Blue House at the back of the palace which is now the president's office."
4869,4.0,"Beautiful palace. Make sure you you're there for the change of the guard, as it makes the whole thing more special. The National Folk Museum is inside and also worth a visit."
4870,5.0,"This is the main palace in Seoul. The grounds are vast and it contains multiple rows of buildings and walkways. You can spend several hours strolling through them and taking pictures. The mountains in the backdrop make it for a very picturesque scenery that allows the photographer to experiment with different angles and light. I truly enjoyed the experience, despite the bitter cold and lack of greenery in early December."
4871,5.0,Not to be missed when you visit Seoul. We recommend that you do the free guided tour which is very useful to understand the historical background and the architecture.
4872,5.0,"When visiting the palace, you should definitely time your visit so that you will get to see the changing of the guards. It's on multiple times a day but you better check the current schedule for it. The location of the palace is great, as it's right in the heart of Seoul - easy to find if you can find the statue of Sejong the Great.  The whole area of Gyeongbokgung is huge and there's a lot of place to explore so go early and take your time. At the end of the palace grounds, there's also a museum that's definitely worth a visit. Insadong is within walking distance with it's shops and restaurants, so you can easily spend the entire day around this area."
4873,4.0,Exquisite artwork stunning architecture and a great way to learn about Korean history. It's dead center so you can enjoy the historical aspects of Korea and then walk down street and find a really amazing restaurants
4874,4.0,"Check the timetable for the free guided tours. Although the scale of the palace is rather small, but definitely worth visiting for a quick korean history class."
4875,5.0,"The train station (line 3 - orange line, exit 5 Gyeongbokgung Station) leads you right to the palace grounds. It was so convenient. If you time your visit, you could witness the changing of the guards. Also, connected to this is the National Museum and outside the gates are the monuments of King Sejong and Admiral Sunshin Yi."
4876,5.0,For a small fee you can enter the main complex and you may even catch the free english (or Chinese) tours. There is a the changing of the guard ceremony which occurs a few times a day.  The complex is large and you can easily spend hours wandering around.
4877,4.0,"We arrived at this palace around 3.00 p.m. We watched changing guard ceremony. We thought our kids will be bored to see that, but they loved it. The palace are so big. If you don't have time to look around, just visit the gate (gwanghwamun), geunjeongjeon, gyenhoeru, hwangwonjeong. There is national folk museum and national palace museum in this palace. You can reach the palace by using metro subway, stop at gyeongbokgung (line 3) exit 5."
4878,5.0,"The palace is soooooooo big and that we didn't finished it by 3 hours? Omg. Well, it's really a worth place to visit and I enjoyed a lot there especially inside the museum in the palace!"
4879,5.0,The visit is not free but I feel it's worth visiting. Always nice to know how the people in the past (rich or poor) lived and how they contributed to what we see today.
4880,4.0,As a part of your tour to Seoul you have to go to visit the palace . I front of the palace there is an exhibition try to visit it is free of charge and open until 6 pm . The palace is closed at 5 pm
4881,5.0,"An incredible place that is so peaceful! Definitely a must see when in Seoul! This place is exactly what you think of when you think of Asia, beautiful palaces on a tranquil pond and if you're there during early spring during cherry blossom"
4882,3.0,"Beautiful palace walk and nice photo shoot. This place is easily accessible by the metro, ask your hotel staff for directions."
4883,5.0,My sister and I enjoyed visiting the palace. We took a free English walking tour of the place and this helped us to learn about the history.
4884,3.0,"Not a place for kids for sure but those who love to take photograph, it provide vibrant colour and excellant architectural piece."
4885,4.0,"Went on a chilly December Saturday. Lots of people there but it's a big place. A volunteer tour guide met us at the subway station and walked with us, explaining in English what we were seeing. She was great, and only 14!  Chinese style palace, so you keep walking through more and more court yards, each dominated by a higher and more important building. Nice, natural setting with mountains in the background. Particular features are the roof decorations and the underfloor heating systems. Thanks to our young guide for pointing them out.  Look out for the pavilions that stand on ornamental ponds. Imagine yourself in the palace's heyday, enjoying the views and relaxation of these pleasure pavilions. Unfortunately, you need to imagine, as only the reconstructed buildings and the mountains are left.  Easy access from the subway station and a couple of museums nearby. Together they can fill most of a day."
4886,5.0,"This was our first tourist stop in Seoul. Many great photo opportunities and unless you read up ahead of time the guided tour worth it to explain the layout. We went early am to avoid crowds. As we left, the tour buses were beginning to pull up."
4887,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is centrally located near the heart of Seoul, is inexpensive, and is a wonderful example of the beautiful historical Korean architecture that epitomizes the ancient Silla Kingdom. A great place to stroll if the weather is good. Try to time your visit to include the changing of the guard."
4888,3.0,It's a big palace complex make sure to wear your comfort shoe. Not a lot to say since I compare it with Tiannanmen in Beijing. The feeling more or less the same with slightly diffrent characters of building.
4889,5.0,"We going for winter vacation on december in Gyeobgbokgung palace korea, wheater 1 - 3 degree celcius. Bring your therma jacket along, hand glove , hat to avoid cold here. Their service is only to 5 PM then close"
4890,4.0,"Well if you like walking around and looking at some nice Buddhist architecture, this is a cool place to go. It wasn't a huge thrill or anything so you have to be into the history and the meaning of the place if you want to get a kick out of it. For me it was a nice place to take pictures."
4891,5.0,I was surprised to see that the palace was open for visitors at night. all the buildings were illuminated. I had a very good opportunity for very good night shots of this magnificent place.
4892,4.0,"It was a cold rainy day on my visit, so it kind of ruin my visit. The guide armed with an umbrella seemed oblivious we are getting wet and cold . So, we tried to keep up with her and wishing for shelter and hot coffee . The structure is beautiful but also sad that a lot of the buildings were destroyed before. ... do come , on a nice sunny day. There is a nice walnut pastry shop from gyeongbokgung stn exit 2 ...cocohodo....its absolutely delicious and you can walk down further to Tongin market for their famous dosirak lunch tray"
4893,5.0,"It's Seoul's Northern Palace and subsequently also the largest palace in Seoul. There isn't much to say about the Palace other than that you need to go if you're traveling in Seoul. The grounds are huge and the buildings are beautiful. Yes, there are quite a lot of people, but that is to be expected. If you really really dislike crowds, I would suggest the Changgyeonggung Palace (just east of Gyeongbokgung) however this palace is not nearly as impressive."
4894,4.0,"An interesting place to visit, they said that in ancient times the square represents the earth while the circle represent the sky..."
4895,4.0,"Gorgeous views all around at this palace. A lot of people were here, but the grounds are so large that they were spread out pretty well. We went in November so the trees were those wonderful fall colors and made for spectacular pictures. The admission is cheap (3000W) and the tours are free if you wanted to do that. One problem was that there aren't any signs around to explain to you what each building was. Therefore, we were going to do a tour, but as my boyfriend could read the Chinese above the doors, we didn't actually need to do it. The palace is right next to the Bukchon Hanok village, Samcheondong, and Insadong so we visited all of these places in one day. For those of you that count steps, you get a TON of walking doing this haha. So definitely wear comfortable shoes. All in all a really great tourist attraction. I recommend visiting in the Fall."
4896,5.0,"Guard ceremony at the entrance is definitely something to plan your trip around. The palace grounds are beautiful and we learned a lot about korean royal history. The audio guides are great.  There's a museum inside the palace, which takes around 45 to 60 minutes to walk through.  Highly recommended!!"
4897,4.0,Large grounds. Tough with a toddler in a stroller over some terrain but lovely buildings. Thought there might be more gardens etc but overall very picturesque and a must see. Audio guide worth doing. Wear comfortable closed in shoes. Can get muddy. Changing of the guard also good to see.
4898,5.0,"For those who are taking their first trip to Korea should really visit this place. Lots of history, lots of nice preserved architecture and you get to see what's it like back in the days because the staff would wear the traditional outfits as well a small ceremony performance."
4899,4.0,"This palace was beautiful! As there are so many palaces around in Seoul and we were pressed for time, we only managed to visit this one because we spent a longer time there than expected but no regrets! The grounds are massive and if you can spend the time, don't rush and walk around to discover the gardens and other smaller outbuildings. We spent some time in the Crown Prince's garden (towards the right when you just pass the main building) and it was just beautiful. You can even pack a lunch and have it on the benches under the pretty trees if you like (we saw some locals doing it)."
4900,4.0,"A well maintained temple that offers a glimpse into the history of the country. A large spread out area with many buildings to see, so make sure you allow a decent amount of time to get around"
4901,4.0,"The palace is huge!!! It has interesting architecture and beautiful garden. There are also various cultural and art performance, including the change of guard ceremony that is very delightful to watch."
4902,5.0,This place is super cool. It's about $8 to visit. English yours are available and the culture museum is included in the price. The walk around the gardens and grounds is perfect for a warm sunny day. Make sure you stay and watch the changing of the guards and get a pic with one of them.
4903,5.0,"We visited in early December. It was cold enough that the ice was frozen over on the pond. We arrived just as the actors were coming out and putting on their show. There was no crowd so we got a great view. Walking through the facility was a joy and you can go just about anywhere in the facility. Parking was easy and it was relatively cheap. I don't remember what it cost, but it wasn't even a second though to pay."
4904,5.0,"This palace is really huge. The architecture is awesome. If you are lucky, you can see live changing guard ceremony. Only pay 3000₩ for entrance fee. Please wear something comfortable."
4905,5.0,"It's huge, so prepare the most of the day for taking the tours. Make sure to bring water with you. Bring a lot!! Read about the palace in advance so you can enjoy your visit. It's worth all the time and the tickets are cheap. Btw. Buy a group ticket for all the great palaces because it's a money saver. Also bring your Korean friends with you, they can enter for free if they're under 25, and accompany you even on English tours."
4906,3.0,"i don't know Korean language so i hope that when visiting a historic site, i would have english signs to read, but i don't foun many except name signs. you will have free map and a small guidance to look at, an if you have the patience you can open it, see where you are standing and read about it though. still, many buildings look ...just the same for me and i dont really get the sense of it. but the place is very broad and it were hard for me to do so when one hand is busy holding the umbrella and shopping bags .it was rainy and i found the walk quite exhausted. so i don't recommend shopping before going to the palace."
4907,5.0,This is nice place to stroll even on rainy days. Make sure you either get guided tour or audio translation. You will learn history and behind story related to each sights.
4908,5.0,"We visited the palace when it was snowing. Although the guard changing parade was cancelled due to the snow, we were not disappointed. The snow transformed the palace and its ground to an amazing sight! We joined the English tour and it was very informative."
4909,5.0,if you can get a local of hire a guide...would pobably help...my friends knew what was happening and the different buildings ...great day
4910,3.0,This place next to the national folk museum of Korea. i didn't really enjoy this place because i came to this place at the end of november and already cold and windy.
4911,4.0,"great spot for photo opportunity. accessible by subway thru anguk station. i think the entrance fee is about 3,000 kwn per person. not too large but good enough for a brisk walk around."
4912,5.0,"DATE VISITED: November 18, 2014  PROS: Amazing place in the Heart of Seoul. Beautiful Palace. Wait for the Changing of the Guards at around 3:00/4:00pm. It's worth watching!  CONS: Too many people. Some tourists don't know how to follow order to discontinue from walking in and out of the site where Changing of the Guards took place. Geeez!  LOCATION: 5/5 PRICE: 5/5 HOSPITALITY: 4/5 ATTRACTIONS: 4/5"
4913,4.0,"Elegant little palace in the heart of Seoul. Find tranquility from madness of Seoul in the quiet grounds of Gyeongbukgung Palace. Must remember though, Korea was never as big as China so it's no Forbidden Palace but beautiful and significant all the same."
4914,3.0,A place definitely worth a visit if you are in Seoul. It is however a pity that you as a tourist are not allowed to enter any of the buildings.
4915,5.0,"The palace grounds are huge. Don't try and do this on your own. You need a guide to explain the layout and importance of the architecture and history.  Be warned - the steps can be high and tricky. Wear comfortable shoes and take it at your own pace. Visit the Korean Folk museum to get an overview of life. Also, there's another museum by the main gate that features some of the royal cars.  The changing of the guard is impressive. Don't expect the huge pageantry of Buckingham Palace. This is a much smaller ceremony worth viewing.  If you walk all the way to far back corner, beyond the lagoons, you get a great view of the current Presidential House. Be sure to keep your ticket with you."
4916,5.0,Visited the palace in November and the autumn leaves were simply stunning. Also recommend catching the tour - it lasts about an hour and gives you an overview of the various buildings within the grounds.
4917,5.0,"Really nice place.. If you love the story of Korean Joseon dynasty, here is the must to visit in Seoul.. You can try Korean hanbook for free here..😁😁"
4918,5.0,This is one of may favorite places to visit in Seoul. It's beautiful and steeped in rich history. The guided tours in English are wonderful. I would definitely recommend going.
4919,5.0,"A stunning palace experience. It was pure joy, wandering around the grounds and looking into the buildings on the Gyeongbokgung grounds. A must visit for anyone in Seoul."
4920,4.0,Close by to our hotel in Jongno-gu. We could have gone by subway or chosen to walk. As we arrived there was a changing of the guards. Make sure to have a photograph taken beside a guard. The inside of the palace grounds is enormous with an attractive lake like area at the rear. Be sure to allow an hour or two to wander around the surrounds. The entry fee is quite reasonable and you will find an appealing cafe/gift shop towards the centre of the grounds.
4921,5.0,Had a friend guided us here which is wasn't far from our hotel in Myeongdong. It was a good walk and we just arrived in time for a guard change. We didn't make it around the whole place but it was great to look around a traditional area and landscape. It started to rain so it was cut short and could only spend an hour before close but I would like to visit again. Took some really nice photos.
4922,4.0,This is well worth the effort to see while you are in Seoul South Korea. Make sure you go to the front and watch the changing of the guard. A few minutes before the changing of the guard they march in the side yard.
4923,4.0,"It's a lovely palace located in center of Seoul. To get there you can just use the seoul subway line 3 exit 5. The view is so amazing, and you can see the attraction also if you are lucky."
4924,5.0,This is a majestic palace. It basically is the 'heart and soul' of Korea. There is a historical significance to the palace that makes you stop and think about the history that took place in the palace. It was a worthwile half day excursion and I do recommend going when it is nice weather - not too hot or cold.
4925,4.0,"If you like historical places, try this. A huge place and connected to the Folk Museum of Korea. Very interesting."
4926,4.0,"We had previously visited the Changdeokgung Palace and felt that this palace was pretty much the same only larger with far more tourists. My conclusion is if you have time for only one palace, go see Changdeokgung instead. It's only about a kilometer or so up the street. Anyway - we did enjoy the visit here and found some spots not completely mobbed by tourists. There were lots of teens in hanbok which leant an old world authenticity to the site."
4927,5.0,"Conveniently accessed by public transportation and close to a bunch of other attractions like Bukchon Village and Cheonggyecheon Stream, I would suggest to head out early to Bukchon Village, enter Gyeongbokgung Palace and head out to Cheonggyecheon Stream for the evening. The palace is beautiful but can be very full at times, but try to see as much of the buildings as possible, especially the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion and don't forget to see the re-enactments of Korean royal guards in the court yard."
4928,3.0,"This place were huge. Nothing much to see or do here. Empty buildings, dull ground. There are beautiful lake and small cafe. i went here in spring season . Weather kinda hot. This area will be hotter in summer because the surrounding are plain desert."
4929,4.0,This is one of two main palace in Seoul but is more prominent. I would choose this location as it is closer to other sites such as samcheungdong and everything can be done in a day. There's a little confusion to where the entrance is as we were looking for the ticket counter. That is actually inside and there are many ways to get in from the front and southeast and southwest area.
4930,5.0,Like the every bit of the view and the palace. What a technology and I liked the way solders shifted their timing.
4931,3.0,It's worth to pay a visit here. Quite a big compound with scenic view and historical buildings. Get ready to spend 2-3 hours walking around. Remember to take along the brochure at the ticket counter if you were interested to know the history as there is no notice board that put aside for you to read. Do plan your visit to align with the guard changing ceremony. One thing disappointing is some of the buildings are closed for visit.
4932,3.0,"Visited on a rainy day so maybe that is part of the disappointment. Other than change of the guard did not see anything too exciting other than the main area. Very little offered in English so had difficulty understanding the context. I you have to choose one, go for the Changdeokgung Palace instead."
4933,4.0,South Korea is very much famous of its heritage such that it will always be a good idea when visiting to this country to go to the palaces. Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the famous palaces in South Korea. The place is big and you can explore. It is good to go there in the morning. There is an entrance fee of 3000 KRW.
4934,3.0,"I love to see history and building structures and all.  However, I am slightly disappointed with Gyeongbokgung Palace as most of it places are close to public.  Noone is allowed to see what it is inside. So for me, it is a turn off.  This trip is more of like a trip to see building, lakes, and park, and nothing about the palace."
4935,5.0,"This was a palace in the era of Joseon Dynasty which is well maintained. There are two lakes with gazebos: Kyunghoilu and Hyangwonjeong. These two lakes are very beautiful. From time to time, this place is open to the public at night times and you should book at the designated dates if you want to see it. Especially, the night views of these two lakes are the most beautiful. Many photographers gather to take pictures of them."
4936,3.0,"The palace grounds was very huge but every check point is about the same.the king's chambers, the queen mother's chambers then the concubines' chambers. They all look the same. I was a bit disappointed to find out that almost the entire place is rebuilt, it's not the original palace but it was burnt down during the Japanese invasion. and they're not done adding on new segments of the palace. entrance fee is pretty cheap. the architecture seems pretty normal. probably the more interesting thing to do here is to try on the palace guard uniform for free and witness the guard changing ceremony. give this a miss if you are not into touristy stuff."
4937,5.0,"We enjoyed the buildings all around Seoul, but what was even better were the grounds of the palace (trees, lakes, etc.) - especially in mid-November as the leaves were all changing to incredible colors of red, yellow, orange. Endless incredible photo opportunities."
4938,4.0,"Was there in mid September, the weather was just nice for a morning stroll of the palace. Nicely replicated buildings n landscaped gardens filled with rich history. We joined a free guide tour when there. It was an informative tour indeed ... You get to learn not just the history but the clever olden days architecture design of the buildings catering to the different Seasons of the year, and the interesting culture of the palace.  Do go there in the mornings when there's lesser crowd. Do check out their Seoul tourism website on the timings of the free guided tour and the days which the palace is open at night for visits.  After visiting the palace, do pop over to Samcheong dong which is east of Gyeongbokung ... just a short distance from the palace. It's a little quaint Neighbourhood filled with little art galleries, shops, cafe, restaurant. Be prepared to do walk hard as it's road are straight but has many slopes."
4939,4.0,"I walked to Gyeongbokgung Palace early morning from my Lotte Hotel (Fantastic Hotel by the way, one of the nicest I've stayed in anywhere in the world for a reasonable price). During the week day in early morning in the October there was very few people inside the walls of the palace. Made for a great morning visit of solitude, learning history and photo opportunities. As the morning progressed the palace became more crowded with tourists and school tours. If you are in Seoul the Changdeokgung Palace is a must see."
4940,4.0,Suggest to visit this Palace on the first few days of your trip and walk all the way towards the back where the pond is located. The palace is very well maintained. Looks very similar to other Asian Palaces. There is a train station entrance by the museum beside the palace too
4941,3.0,"While I was looking forward to this trip, I did not have any expectations whatsoever so as not to ruin the mood. This is the second palace I visited, and it lies just in front of two statues, one of the admiral and the other King Sejong, seated in a chair, and founder of the Korean alphabet. The ticket entrance was 5000 won, a bit hefty if you ask me. The tour started and I joined a tour with an English translator, kudos to the translator for really trying to explain the history and details of all the buildings.  The architecture and style can somewhat be likened to those found in Shanghai and Beijing, maybe because of cultural influences. I was a bit disappointed though because of the lack of English descriptions of each of the place. Signages are also scant in the area and be ready to endure long walks!  I suggest going here in the morning or early lunch time so that you can have time to visit the blue house which the guide said was one gate away only from inside this palace. Unfortunately, I didn't see the blue house.  In total, I find this palace, nothing special, an average if you ask me, but I commend the departments involved here for really making sure to preserve the edifices. So, in going to Seoul, choose wisely which among the palaces you'll be visiting. This one would not be in my list again."
4942,5.0,"Visitors should put this Seoul attraction on their list. For amateur photographers, it's provides a good opportunity to experiment and compose picture perfect shots. Take note of the schedule of the very colorful and ritual-driven Changing of the Guards as this is one activity that visitors to the attraction musn't miss."
4943,4.0,"This is a very huge complex of buildings, accessible from the Geongbokgung station. Ther is also a folk art museum and a palace museum inside."
4944,3.0,"It's a very big palace, you need at least an hour to walk inside and see whole area however it's beautiful especially during spring / autumn. It's better to visit in the afternoon so you can see the beautiful mountain view."
4945,5.0,"This palace was one of the most important during the Joseon Dinasty, from 1392 to 2010. This palace is well preserved and it is possible to see the role of the king over Korea Peninsula. On that time Korea was only one country It was not divided like nowadays. In front of the main entrance it is possible to see the change of the guard, two times a day. If you are in Seul, you must go there."
4946,3.0,"After all the 5 star reviews, I was anticipating a nice historical museum. However, there are few signs, no description, very little furnishings in any of the buildings. Perhaps six rooms were setup. It was hard to get an idea of what life was like. We got the audio guides but they were not that helpful because there were no artifacts to look at! Not at all comparable to theForbidden Palace which has extensive exhibits"
4947,5.0,"Definitely worth a stroll - beautiful palace and all its buildings, the park in autumn is fabulous. The highlight are the palace guards and the change of guard ceremony."
4948,4.0,The palace had recorded many dynasty of Korea. Rent the audio guide if you come by yourself. There is many gates into the palace and how its expended over dynasty. A must for history lover.
4949,4.0,We got to Gyeongbokgung Palace on foot from Bukchon in mid afternoon and caught the changing of the guards which is one of the attractions. It was quite fascinating and impressive and worth the visit. We were unable to visit the entire palace.
4950,5.0,"Went here at the palace with my fiance and my sister November 2o15. It was the perfect time because it was autumn. We arrived at the palace before 1 PM. We waited for the changing of the guards ceremony to start. Watch the whole ceremony which was 15 minutes long approximately. I had fun watching the changing of the guards ceremony, i was looking forward to watching this."
4951,4.0,This is 1 of the highlights in Seoul and is really worth a visit. The architecture is awesome and the palace itself is beautiful. Loads of great photo opportunities and if you are into culture and history it really is s must visit
4952,4.0,"Oustanding place to visit, the palace was pretty and very clean check many other places and was such a good nice trip"
4953,4.0,"It very much reminded me of the Forbidden Palace setup in Beijing, but felt much more extensive. The fall colors on the trees were fabulous. It seems to be more beautifully landscaped in Seoul. It was big enough to feel you could get lost. We did not do a tour, but many people were and you would learn a lot more by taking a tour."
4954,4.0,"Come at time of change guard ceromony. Huge palace, good if you like history. come earlier to explore close at 5 pm"
4955,5.0,"were here for leisure, 3 of us really enjoy the beautiful scenery, clean place. visited in early morning, this place open at 9 am. All tree change colour of leaf make it refreshing your eyes. Only rainy that stop us to enjoy more, also don't miss the guard palace parade. with those cute guard"
4956,5.0,This place is must visit when you are in Seoul. It gives you an insight of Joseon dynasty architecture. Once you are here then dont miss the changing of the guards at the main gate.
4957,5.0,"It is in central city of Seoul. And the palace is Main and First palace of Joseon Kingdom (1392 ~ 1910).  It is comparably new relic, instead Gyeongju city is from BC57 of Silla Kingdom (BC57 ~ AD935).  Anyway it has many merit to visit because it is inside Seoul, easy access.  :)"
4958,5.0,"Located right outside Gyeongbokgung station, entry into the palace costs 3000 won. You can also exchange currency there. Architecture of it all is amazing. Don't forget to bring your camera or you will regret it ! :D"
4959,3.0,"As much as I've enjoyed the forbidden city in Beijing, I had a good time exploring Gyeongbokgung Palace with my camera. historical architecture and beautiful garden walk which I often seen in Korean period drama! It was very very crowded when I was there."
4960,5.0,"You will love Korean history here and will start to watch Korean historic dramas afterwards. It is so big that you may ramble in its labyrinths for hours, it seems like desert even if there are many visitors. Don't miss the change of the guards: feel the rhythm of the drums."
4961,5.0,"Such a stunning place, visited late in the afternoon. Park closes at 5 sharp so give yourself plenty of time to venture around the grounds."
4962,4.0,A lovely palace to see. Easy to walk around for all ages. It's inexpensive and if you keep your ticket the museum is free too. It was so beautiful on the day I went and the leaves were changing colors.
4963,5.0,"I went here on a Thursday which I think was good because it was not that many people there as I would expect it to be on a weekend. Very easy to get there by metro and the entrance is only 3000 won, a little less than 3USD. The park is really nice especially in autumn with a lot of different colors and a lot of space. Defiantly worth a visit. There is also a museum of Korean people and history connected to the palace where you get free entrance if you went to the palace. It was also good for those that doesn't know that much about the development of Korea and its people."
4964,4.0,"I went there during the national holiday when you can visit for free. Very good place to know more about korean culture. If you go to this place, don't lose the opportunity to visit the museum with the history of the country. To know the Gyeongbokgung Palace, walk around and go to the museum you have to spend few hours."
4965,4.0,We didn't get to see much of the gyeongbok palace because our tour was in a rush. But they had an interesting architecture & heating system which was explained by our local guide.
4966,3.0,The fall is the best time to visit this palace and Seoul. Do not except a fancy place cuz you will see a simple and quite buildings but it has the Korean style which you like👌
4967,4.0,"A sprawling area with beautiful gardens and trees. The change of gaurds takes place everyday at 11:00, 14:00"
4968,5.0,"This is the best palace amongst all. If you have the time, then you should visit this. Quite nice but this cannot compare to the magnificent Forbidden Palace in Beijing."
4969,5.0,"Its the best time now ...autumn,cooling but not too cold. You can visit the museum n garden furst n option to enter the palace."
4970,4.0,The Gyeongbokgung or imperial palace is a must visit for visitors to Seoul. The main entrance is impressive and visitors can see the parade of the royal guard behind the compound of the gate at fix time interval of the day. Inside the palace compound visitors can appreciate the beauty and majestic setting of the various sections of the palace. The throne chamber is very impressive and visitors can also get to see Korean in traditional dresses. A must stop itenary for any visitor to Seoul.
4971,5.0,"Very impressive and beautiful structures. Perfect place to walk around and enjoy the scenery for an hour or two. There are local high-school students - ""volunteer guides"" who will offer to walk you around for a small tip...it is fun but if you have an access to Wikipedia, you would learn more... I suggest against the museums there. They are underwhelming."
4972,4.0,This is really a very beautiful place. The only drawback was that they were doing some major building in one area. Lovely autumn colors and a very easy place to navigate on your own. Also very close to some great museums.
4973,4.0,I love the huge area of this palace. Love the structures of the buildings. Love the surroundings. Love the scenic views of the nature inside the palace area. This place is damn relaxing!
4974,4.0,I just love Korean culture. Visiting this place is a reminiscent of the Korean royalty. It's just sad that they don't exist today :(
4975,5.0,"I had a great time here, I spent a couple of hours slowly taking in the atmosphere, beautiful buildings and fantastic autumn leaves."
4976,4.0,"This is one the tourist recommended site so we decided to give it a go. It is situated in quite a large area, we are not allowed into the building so we have to view it from openings that have been built for tourist I reckon. The man building which I supposed is where the King reside is beautiful, looks like the bernal building is handcrafted, with so fine detail and beautiful Colours. There are other buildings but we are not allowed in. With the autumn leaves falling and trees turning brown accompanied by cold weather, it was a pleasant trip. The highlight is probably the changing of the Guards, not as elaborate at the one in Buckingham palace but still pleasant to watch. Overall it's quite nice and I would recommend everyone a visit to the palace,"
4977,5.0,"Spring - Summer - Fall - or Winter, in each season the palace will have its own beauty. If you should choose only a ""gung"" to visit, this is the one."
4978,5.0,"The Palace was great. We had a beautiful day to walk around the grounds and enjoy the scenery. When we were there, there was a lot of young girls wearing the traditional dresses. The hanbocks were beautiful with lots of bright and vibrant colors. Nice to see them."
4979,4.0,"We got lucky with our DIY tour to the G- Palace, as we arrived at the outside palace square we saw Koreans fully dressed in gala uniform only to find out that the changing of the guards was about to happen-3:00 pm. Wonderful ! So the best tip -- be there before 3 pm , long walk to toilets-- it's by the parking lot! The walk between Bukchum to the G Palace had a Redtaurant with the famous chicken with ginseng soup dish - must try at least once in a visit to Seoul. Add Salt &!pepper to taste :-)"
4980,5.0,Although it is rebuilt from the ruins the Japanese invasion left it is an impressive insight in the historic king's palace and with a 1 hour tour in english you get all the essential information.
4981,4.0,"We went as a family with an elderly using wheelchair. Firstly, the Palace is good to visit as it is rich in history and the changing of the guards is great to watch. The palace has a beautiful garden on the side and a beautiful lake too. The colors are just wonderful in Autumn. Toilets are available before you go into the palace and there are toilets in the palace too. There are cubicles with sitting toilets. However, I can't say that the palace grounds are exactly wheelchair friendly because the ground is sandy and certain parts are paved with very large slabs with huge edges and not convenient to push a wheelchair. We ended up pushing the wheelchair through the corridors and into the side gardens and lake. Plenty of places for good photo shots. There's really no need to join a tour. You'll manage visiting this place on your own."
4982,4.0,It is free for seniors. It was bigger than what we expected with a lot of walking. We were rewarded with a colourful autumn foliage at the other end of the palace ground. The guard changing ceremony was also worth watching.
4983,4.0,Went on a lovely sunny day first thing in the morning when the palace opened so it was quiet and pretty. The grounds are huge so lots of photo opportunities. The museum attached is free to enter and also worth a visit.
4984,4.0,"Its really large for visiting. U should spend at least half of day here. There are many beautiful sights in autumn. And the street around the palace is also nice, too. The ticket included 2 museums also."
4985,4.0,"This was a MUST SEE for us and should be for you, too.  VERY reasonable admission ticket...about $2.50US. They offer tours in English at 11AM each day they are open....closed Tuesdays. I would also assume they offer tours in other major languages during the day.  WEAR comfortable shoes/sneakers, as there is a lot of standing and walking involved. Some stairs, uneven places. Our guide was very good, a charm, really.  Magnificent buildings, colorful and well versed by our guide. Just walking around on your own might not give the same presentation...TAKE A FREE TOUR, if possible. Allow just over an hour if you take the free tour. Food shop is small but offers the basics and more...water, iced coffee, tea, GREAT ice cream, etc. Tables outside and inside. VERY, VERY reasonable. Then, on your same ticket, you can go right next door to the Folk Museum and see that. A very good deal.  Very memorable and again, a must see while in Seoul."
4986,5.0,I love how we seemed to travel in time. We were early so we were able to enjoy the place to ourselves.  Free to the Public on Wednesdays.
4987,4.0,"Enjoyed it, not as much as the secret garden and other palaces or the shrine, but definitely the largest and most visited temple. Skipped the tour and walked around on my own. Not much to see except the very spartan buildings, all the area around has been cleared sort of, very little vegetation."
4988,5.0,"unbelievable what has been built centuries ago, and is still in such a good shape. I believe there is a lot of energy spent on keeping it in good shape, but it makes you feel how it has felt in Korea in the 13th century"
4989,4.0,"It is recommended to spend around 2 to 3 hours . There is a ceremony of changing guards around 10pm which take around 10 to 15 mins . Administration is quite cheap . But the building structure is almost the same , you will lose interests after 2 hours ."
4990,5.0,The wide courtyards and the architecture of the palace kinda gets you back to thinking how it was 700 years ago. Must have been very regal. What I loved most was the gardens at the back of the palace which were full of autumnal colours. You can easily spend 3-4 hours here and don't miss the food at the Gyeongbokgung café. It was my first Korean meal and the Tteokbokki and Veg Bibimbap was amazing!Not forgetting the Kimchi!
4991,5.0,Gyeongbokgung palace was an absolutely stunning place to visit. We went on the last day of Chuseok so it was very busy with school groups and visitors for a festival.  It's very large but there's lots to see with several old buildings open to view and walk around. There isn't too much to say other than it was a truely breath taking place.
4992,5.0,The Palace is a lovely place to spend an hour of 4 with nice buildings and a lovely Garden. On site is also the Korean Folk Museum.
4993,4.0,If you're looking to learn a little more about Korea's history and enjoy some historic oriental architecture this is a great place to start.  The palace itself is within the city so it is a comfortable find (public transport will get you there easily). Within the palace there's plenty of space to relax - especially if you venture beyond the palace rooms and into the garden area.  Makes for some great photographs and a relaxing break.
4994,5.0,"This is the only Palace my husband and I visited in Seoul. It's a large complex so prepare to spend 2-3 hours to explore. Admission was free when we got there but rented audio guide cost 3000 won. There is free guided tour (English, Japanese, Chinese) starting at Heungnyemun Gate (2nd Gate), make sure to check the time if you planned to follow. We just missed it. My favourite spots are Hyangwonjeong Pavilion and Gyeonghoeru Pavilion."
4995,5.0,We loved visiting this palace! Very well signed for an American tourist. Don't miss the opportunity to see how the ruling class lived.
4996,5.0,"Ancient place, we can see many historical palaces which is in every palace has a different story. They have a schedule to ""changing guard"" if you are lucky you can see that."
4997,5.0,"Visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace is definitely a must if you are in Seoul! Try to visit the palace when the change of guards is happenning, it will be an awesome experience. We also wanted to attend a free English guided tour, but since the group included 50+ people and the guide's voice couldn't be heard, we decided to discover the palace on our own. If you don't attend a tour, it's better to be prepared on what you will see and read descriptions, otherwise after some time the visit can be boring. For us it was a great experince!"
4998,5.0,"Took the train to the stop just in front of the palace also named after the palace. Try to get there by 10 am as teher is a changing of guards parade which is quite fun to watch. you can also take pics with the traditionally garbed guards at the South main gate. Much like the Beefeaters, they cannot talk and will not move. make sure to line up and be orderly!  the palace was well preserved and there is much space to walk about and roam despite the tourist hordes that were everywhere. We went in all the way till we arrived at the back garden sanctuary which feature ponds, trees and small hillocks. this was a gem of a garden in the heart of Seoul and a great place to just sit down on the grass and imbue the tranquillity of the place. The looming hills just beyond the walls were a magnificent backdrop as is the pond to the east where there was a picturesque pagoda on the island in the centre. Many shutterbugs were capturing the beauty of the place. Do take the exit where the National Folk Museum is ..take the EAST gate and from there you can take a leisurely stroll past arty shops to Insadong where u can have a wonderful lunch in one of the traditional eating houses in the side lanes!"
4999,5.0,"We got to watch the ceremony sharp at 3pm everyday. Actually they have 3 times everyday. In morning, 3pm and late evning if i'm not mistaken. The largest palace in Korea it is, with beautiful original hundred years of architecture! Not to forget, do try to don the guards' uniform for free! The place to try the uniform is near the front gate."
5000,3.0,Nice palace with colourful guard to take picture. It was raining that day therefore did not take any photo. I prefer Cheongdeokgung.  However it's directly link to metro. Easy to find.  It's also near the museum where it's more informative.
5001,5.0,We had a tour guide to show us apround but just going by yourself would be fine too. It was very busy with kindergarten kids everywhere but I think it would have been so busy other than that.
5002,4.0,"I love this place, you can caugth many things when you walking around the palace. A beautiful natural view, traditional culture touch, guards atraction, try guards costume, and feel like a part of kingdom. Really touching and i promise that i'll be back in autumn."
5003,5.0,"Nice place worth to visit and walk in Seoul, where one can familiarize himself with the Korean history and culture. It is good to know the schedule of guided tours before you go to visit. Usually the free guided tours in english are available two or three times per day, but you need to know the time. However, even without a guide you can easily understand the meaning of each dwelling by reading the information tablets. Also there are many nice places to take a photo."
5004,3.0,Can easily be done in an hour. Only $3USD. Good photo opportunities. Not much history or displays or artifacts. The buildings look the same after you see a few but definitely Wow for a while.
5005,4.0,"After watching several historical dramas, the palace exceeded my expectations. It is larger and prettier than it appears in the dramas. Several areas were closed and we missed the guided tour, so we most likely didn't have an ideal experience."
5006,5.0,This is a beautiful place and is a must-see during a visit to Seoul. It's interesting to watch the changing of the guards and the museum is also worth a visit. My mother and I were able to enjoy the place without a tour.
5007,4.0,I only had time to glance into the palace by oh boy it was impressive as nothing I ever seen with the mountains in the background. There was a sense of grandeur and warmth that was unlike anything I ever saw and I didn't even really get to go inside to look properly. It's a must see in Seoul for a reason. I only gave it a four because I didn't have the time to go inside. But I urge you to make time and go see it. Booking a tour is probably a good idea too.
5008,4.0,This is a must to see if you are in Seoul.Great to see some Korean heritage. This is a well maintained part of history and a very large palace area. You can get a voice tour which is operated by touching there guide map and it tells you all on the location. After the tour one can relax with a walk around the lovely gardens. It is a very serene and tranquil place in the heart of the hustle and bustle of Korea.  I would recommend to go early in the day as it is extremely popular with coach tours and school parties
5009,5.0,My third time at the gyeong bok gung palace - always fun to visit and have a peaceful walk through the palaces. Takes about 1.5 - 2 hours to complete the walk from entrance to the exit. From the exit you can see and take photos of the Cheong Wadae (blue house).  I would also recommend Chang Deok Gung which is pretty scenic too.
5010,4.0,"This was the number one palace and the ground are large and used four times a day for the changing of the guard ceremony. We went to the 3pm, less people. Times change best to check. The museum outside is worth a visit, bit the exhibits have no English explanations."
5011,4.0,High light of Seoul. Great to visit in a beautiful day. you can ask for tour course. Closed on Tuesday.
5012,4.0,This is one of those place you have to visit while in Seoul to get a glimpse of days of yore. It can get packed with tour groups so quite difficult to get clean shots without photo bombers. Check out the changing of the guards and have your photos taken with them.
5013,4.0,You get to observe the march & changing of guards at the main gate of the palace with a closeup photo allowed standing next to the guard
5014,3.0,Went to Gyeongbokgung Palace on a cloudy day which made it not so good for photo shooting. Worth visiting if you want to know about Korean history.
5015,4.0,"This was a surprising start of our visit to Seoul. Free entrance due to some school holiday, excellent digital guiding system, impressive location ... Close to subway station with the same name, good café at the subway entrance."
5016,5.0,"Time it so you see the main changing of the guard, allow at least three hours to see all it has to offer"
5017,4.0,"The palace was very big and luckily we went there when it was sunny, so it was a nice day out. Also there is museum inside the complex"
5018,2.0,"Our group of 5 from Europe had our last day in Seoul and we got to the palace to see the grounds. The main palace closes very early at about 5:30pm. We got to the door at 5:30 which is the last ticketing time, and the man would not let us through. Our guests had never been to Korea before. The ticketing man and other man who guards the entrance were both so cold and without feeling. As a local, I led the group there and tried to explain in Korean, and was rebuffed so coldly. There's no ombuds service and no customer service in Korea to help improve this kind of poor service, which is too bad since people come with the expectation to be delighted by their experience here. This is one of the main palaces which most tourist try to see. There is a lovely queen's garden, and a good museum all in once place. The servants quarters is a little like a maze so fun to wander through."
5019,5.0,"Most probably the most famous palace in Seoul. And also the biggest. Large area, with a lot of beautiful, colourful buildings. Good to visit on Monday, when the other palaces are closed. Free guided tours are available, but you can enjoy it on your own, as well, especially if you have got a basic knowledge about Korean history. If not, read the panels all around the place. Check for evening visits, as well, for a more misterious scenery. Accesible by metro. Visit the museums inside."
5020,5.0,Very interesting trip. enjoyed the tour. Invest in the audio unless you are on a tour with a guide. Was interesting to learn some of the history of Korea.
5021,4.0,"We went during Mid October 2015. Ticket prices 3000 Won per adult which at the time was equivalent of less than £2. Gyeongbokgung is very easy to get to by the MRT on line 3. It is closed on Tuesdays. Recommended time spent in this attraction: 1.5 - 3 hours.  Firstly, before entering the actual Palace, on the left side of the entrance, there is a free service where you can wear the costume/uniform of the ancient imperial soldiers and take pictures for five minutes. There are timed slots where you can queue up and I think they allow up to 10 people per hour to borrow these costumes to take pictures. I didn't note down the times, but it was something like 11:15, 12:10, 13:15 etc till closing. I highly recommend this as it really adds to the overall experience.  At the entrance you will see guards in the ancient soldiers uniform standing guard and patrolling (much like the Queens guards in London) You can take pictures with them (but not if you are wearing the borrowed uniform - it is forbidden, we saw a girl get told off for doing this).  Inside the palace, though it's not as big or as grand as the Forbidden City in Beijing, houses the ancient architecture with the big halls for the Emperor, his Queens and officers which are beautiful and inspiring. The stone sculptures on the stairs and the roofs look amazing and the artwork inside the halls are exquisite. I definitely recommend a visit to Gyeongbokgung for anyone passing through Seoul, if not for the history then at least for the art that is the palace itself."
5022,5.0,"The palaces are beautiful, but this one is the largest, and is just amazingly beautiful. There is so much to see and the pagoda in the pond I spent hours looking at it. I went here twice, each time I found inner peace. Cheesy yes but true."
5023,5.0,You should visit this great ancient Palace. It's located in Seoul and it's very easy to get there. Subway Gyeongbokgung Exit 5.
5024,5.0,"Very easy to find. We went to a weekend and there were still no queues to speak of and it was not very busy. The palace is so large that you can easily find a space were there are no other people, which makes it feel like a real escape from the city. It is also very interesting and beautiful. I have been to many similar places but because of the size, setting and few clouds I would say this is definitely one of the best, well worth a visit."
5025,5.0,"Korean traditional palace, flowers and trees are very beautiful in autumn.  Historical palace in the historical district within Seoul City  Catch the changing of the guard ceremonies!  Inexpensive admission fee of 3,000 won  Free English tours are apparently at 11am, 1:30pm and 3:30pm.  World heritage site by UNESCO"
5026,5.0,gyeongbokgung palace is absolutely beautiful. its a must visit if you are going to seoul. make sure to wear comfy shoes and clothes as the palace is huge.
5027,4.0,"I've been there in winter days, and enjoying snow.! It's my first time to playing in the middle of snow, and I'm happy that time.! The place are very broad, but there is no restaurant or shop if you want to eat something.!"
5028,4.0,Bring comfortable shoes because this place is HUGE!!!! Make sure to check the times for the changing of the guards ceremony at the front of the palace. Incredible to see the incredible artwork and detail that went into building the palace. We didn't get to make it to the center to the blue house due to our children being tired but make sure to try and visit.
5029,4.0,"i've seen many tourists during our brief stay at the Gyeongbokgung Palace, although we didn't stay that long, it's worth the visit, probably we'll go back there if time permits on our next visit in Seoul!"
5030,4.0,You must try the free palace guard outfit! Its refreshing here. I love the nature. And the history. There is a free english tour guide every 11am. Try it.
5031,5.0,"It's really worth visiting, the grounds are huge! It houses the National Palace Museum and Folk Museum, worth a visit too.  They provide a quick (1hr, believe me it barely scratched the surface) free guided tour, just be at the meeting point at specified hours. The Palace Guide book can be bought (W500) at the information counter before the entrance."
5032,4.0,"i went there on OCT 2015 with my sister and my cousin (total 3 people), my sister already pre booked the free tour guide in English for 2 pax, and we add 1 more pax during arrival, we really highly recommended to join this free guide if you are interested in the history or story behind each building. strongly suggest not visiting on OCT since it is picnic season and the place is full with students. the tour using free guide took 2 hours in total."
5033,4.0,It is a very huge park. 2 hours are not enough to walk through every corner in this palace. The architecture is unique and colourful. Free to experience the costumes. Limited only 5 mins to take picture for each person. The view is awesome in the palace is awesome. Actually it is quite similar to China Palace.
5034,4.0,This is a Magnificent Palace and is a must visit when you are in Seoul.  It has various sub-palaces / theme architecture and you just have to visit them all.
5035,5.0,"Breathtaking palace, it is in a giant park that is lovely to walk around. Free English tours are apparently at 11am, 1:30pm and 3:30pm. 3000 won admission. You get about 30,000 wons worth of wow factor though :) The folk museum is in same park (free admission). Go go go."
5036,4.0,"large open area with different palace buildings and nice ponds, very relaxing. easy to get around, signs in english."
5037,4.0,"Great place to check out for a little taste of the old Korean housing. The area is enormous so your not right on top of other people. There are a lot of big groups coming throughout. Great photo opportunity area, dress warmly. Lots of walking around."
5038,4.0,Beautiful scenery surrounded the palace. Colourful autumn leaves was definitely a stunning background photo. It wasn't too crowded during weekdays. Easily reached by public transportation. A must visit place in Seoul.
5039,5.0,It's a beautiful place ! It allows to have a taste of Traditional Korea Culture. The national palace museum of Korea inside Gyeongbokgung is worth a visit as well.
5040,4.0,I actually enjoyed myself even though the buildings look similar after a while. Place was huge so the guided tour helped a lot. The changing of guards ceremony was nice too. A couple of pretty spots for photo taking too.
5041,4.0,If you like history this is a good place to go. There is guards dressed and standing at attention when you enter the Palace. I would suggest going on their tour.
5042,4.0,Watching the ceremony is a must. The palace is beautiful. And the surrounding area is so neat & beautiful. Many art galleries & so clean..
5043,5.0,"The huge size of the palace complex is quite overwhelming, but exploring each quarter was never boring. The buildings are beautifully preserved/restored. The gardens are well maintained and clean. We were there just in time for the guards changing ceremony, which was interesting to see."
5044,5.0,Nice place for photography. The best time for picture is around 10 am on a sunny day. There is another pond close by.
5045,4.0,"The mountains provide a lovely backdrop to Gyeongbokgung (although the city is right behind you too!). It's easy to get to and makes for a nice wander away from the busy city streets. I arrived early and it was so peaceful, but the crowds tend to draw in as the morning goes on. They hold ceremonial changing of the guards at set times through the morning - apparently the guards are military personnel who 'drew the short straw' - some of their faces might give this away :-)"
5046,4.0,"When we arrived, we walked right into the start of the royal guard ceremony. It was indeed rewarding to watch the event. The palace grounds were crowded and we were indeed fortunate to be able to take photos with the young ladies in their hanbok costumes."
5047,5.0,"I naturally connected to the Gyeongbokgung Palace after watching a Korean Soap back home. The palace is an excellent place to connect to original and traditional Korean culture without living the city centre.  I was able snap pictures with traditional guards who looked like statues, I never knew they were alive until they moved.  While many tour companies do tours of the palace, you can go there yourself, buy the ticket and walk in."
5048,3.0,"There is no doubt that the palace is grand and it covers a large area. I did get the feeling though that it was a shell and that outside of foreign tourists there was little else going on there. The buildings themselves that surround the main palace are all empty and you can only go inside a couple of buildings that were furnished by the Spartans.  I think if you goto Seoul, you do HAVE to visit but don't expect too much apart from a clean pretty palace with nice gardens."
5049,4.0,"The name means ""Palace Greatly Blessed by Heaven.""A nice place to visit. The palace was first built in 1395. The entire complex covers 250,000 square meters. We saw the Presidential Residence at a distance."
5050,5.0,This place offers such a breathtaking view... Really nice place for photos too! It's a little like a maze. Best to go when weather is not too cold so you can explore the place better :)
5051,4.0,"Much of this palace has been recreated following destruction, but it is very much worth seeing. The structures as well as the gardens and grounds make for a wonderful experience."
5052,4.0,Very pretty especially if you haven't been to China or Japan. Skip the other palace across the street unless you like walking in a big park.  It's rebuilt recently the architecture and design is quite similar to Chinese palaces. Worth a couple hours if youre in the area.
5053,4.0,"We didn't get to go this year because it was closed Tuesday, the day we set aside for the 2 palaces near each other. 4 years ago, the 11 of us (grandparents down to youngest 4 years old). We didn't do a guided tour which was great at the other palace this year but it was still beautiful."
5054,5.0,This is a charming palace and well worth visiting. I would highly recommend that you take a guided tour to get the full benefit of your visit. Due to the time of our visit we were unable to seen the Secret Garden as you have to take the site guided tour which is offered 4 times a day (in English). Our private guide indicated that it is a place well worth visiting.
5055,5.0,"I have visited here many times over the years as I enjoy the peaceful strolls through this Korean historical cal site. The many traditional palace structutes, well manicured grounds and the serene location in the heart os Seoul make this a great escape. My favorite part is the lake which is in the center of the palace grounds. It has a beautiful pagoda and is filled with lillies. It is easy to get lost in thought and imagine how beautiful this place was long ago. The entry fee is inexpensive. You can buy a ticket book to access here, three other nearby palaces and a temple for 10,000 Won. That is under 10 US and is a bargain."
5056,5.0,"The palace is tremendously pretty, colourful and big! Lovely place for pictures and lots of Korean teens in their traditional gowns taking selfie! Very fortunate the day of visit was the only sunny and hot day in the week! Spent about 4 hrs walking around, could have been more had the National Palace Museum offered more English translation of the displayed items."
5057,5.0,"A huge sprawling complex, recreating the richness of the centuries of Korean royalty. Best with a guide as it is massive and busy! Loved it. Make sure you see the stationing of the guard gates. Terrific."
5058,5.0,Visit this palace 2nd time. As the last 2 years autumn there are many people visiting this palace not only tourist but the native koreans as well taking chances to go out and enjoy the sceneries before winter coming. Today im so lucky as there are act perfomances from the past dynasties. And also lots of beautiful koreans high school students are wearing han bok and walk around the palace. This is a must kept historical place at korea.
5059,4.0,"It is one of the top ten tourist destination in Seoul so don't miss it if you are here for the first time. It is big place and offer free museum entry, although you will need to pay 3000 won to get to see inside the palace but it is worth it absolutely.  Very easy access as it is connected to the Gyeongbokgung station, just walkout of the station as it is right in front of you ! Can spend just one hour there to have a quick tour if you are not into too much history !"
5060,5.0,"Well if you ask us the history and what the guide was talking about , we were actually not much into it, but the beauty is too good. One of the main attraction to be visited when you in Seoul. Change of guard ceremony was interesting we were there I think 3pm or 4pm and we got to see it!"
5061,5.0,"To understand Korea's 5,000 years of history & ties to Confucius theology, one needs to set aside some time & wear comfortable shoes to walk thru these grounds, see the restored beautiful and best of all five palaces - much like going to BJ to see China's Forbidden City. Our escorted group tour took us via the back by way of the Blue House (Presidential compound - like America's White House) onto the vast complexes - once housed over 7,000 rooms in its 500 buildings, ancient & historic designs in harmony with nature, haven & earth - and how once Imperialistic Japan virtually nearly destroyed SK's rich history and artifacts. The performances, special showings and the daily changing of the ""costumed"" guards are extra bonuses when timed - otherwise, there's plenty of see, visualize and appreciate - of a nation and its people, proud and mindful of its past while steering ahead of its destiny - despite its modern day South-North separation and threats of war."
5062,4.0,"An ideal place to spend 1/2 the day. I recommending getting the audio guide, it is cheap and a good way to get the details of what you are looking at."
5063,5.0,Palace is one of the most traditional thins in Korea. The most important palace for the royalty. Very romantic. Big. There is a museum also which worth a time.
5064,5.0,"You can see the guard changing ceremony and take a picture with them. Very historical. When I was visit there, there was a place for try their guard clothes. Not hanbok, and it is for a guy. But they are allow women who want to try it too.  If you have only few days in Seoul, you can't miss out this place. Actually there are another palace but in my opinion, this is the most famous palace."
5065,4.0,"This is one of the must see places here if you are in Seoul. It is one of the most beatiful temples in Korea and it has a great Changing of the Guard ceremony. You must see this if you are in the area, but you have to be there before 12pm or you will miss it."
5066,4.0,"Either read up,on your history or go with a guide to get the full understanding of this site. The king's quarters, the queen's quarters, the different lanes for walking, the meaning of the colors in the building, all need to be explained etc. The history is very interesting and the grounds are large with many buildings"
5067,5.0,Go and check it out theres free English tours as well  Make sure you wear comfortable shoes from outside it didn't look that big but you walk abit  Great to take photos
5068,5.0,There's changing of royal guard ceremony at the entrance and free tour guide. One of my favourite place to see in Gyeongbokgung palace is Hyangwonjeong! It is so beautiful!
5069,4.0,"I went to Gyeongbokgun Palace last winter. There's a pond inside and it was frozen, just like a mirror. The palace was so big that I walked around 1 hour. I experienced the buildings there and thought about the drama I saw before. There were so many toursits there, as it is really a must-go place in Seoul."
5070,5.0,"If you want to know more about Korea's culture this is a good place to visit. You'll see the structures of their Palace and the guards too. It is muddy when it rains so it would be difficult to walk in the place.. It would be helpful if you have a guide with you so that you would learn more about the structures, what the buildings are.. what they where.. etc."
5071,4.0,Loved all the lovely colours on the buildings. Culturally rich. Good for business travellers on short stay for a 1/2 day outing.
5072,2.0,"There were guided tours in the different languages, but you must check the timings before you go, otherwise you might miss it.  Otherwise, everything in the Palace has been reconstructed. It was something I did not expect. I peered into the many buildings and was empty inside. However, as it was autumn and the palace grounds were quite serene, we managed to find a spot on the grass to chill at. The whole scenery of the place is also very peaceful. You might spot Korean girls in their traditional Hanbok, walking around to snap photos in the palace grounds.  If you would like to know more about the history of the place, I would suggest you find a tour guide, otherwise, it might not make any sense to you."
5073,5.0,"I love these. My Korean friend helped me to visit one of the best sightseeing. At the first time, I had a few time thus I will back here soon."
5074,5.0,"We bought the package which include the admissions to visit other palaces for ₩10,000, and is valid for 3 months, although we were only in Seoul for four days but we did go to other places on the next day. There is a free guide tour and we joined the English tour at 3.30pm."
5075,4.0,"A must in our itinerary when visiting Seoul is to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace. Rich in history and culture of the Ancient Kingdom...Each structure inside has a story, and the best time to visit is autumn."
5076,5.0,"lovely setting - needs a whole day to fully explore all aspects of this stunning, vast inner city temple area....... go on line to view pics"
5077,4.0,"Easily reach by metro station with few mins walk. If you have been to Forbidden City in Beijing, this palace might be a little small and empty. If you have not been there, this is a good place to go. Some comments said its very Korean. I'm not too sure have they been to China's palace? I personally find that they have lots of similarities.  If you are there, just do remember to check out the guard exchange time table which i think this is one of the highlight. They have long exchange ceremony and short exchange ceremony. Besides, they also have a costume booth at the left corner before you heading out. You can put on the exchange guard traditional clothing for picture and they are for free."
5078,5.0,"The Forbidden City in Beijing covers 12 times the land area of Gyeongbukgung, but I find the latter more beautiful ( I included a few photos). It was burned down by Japan in the late 16th century, and not rebuilt until the 19th. Behind the palace is the mountain, and in front Sejong Daero, a large boulevard with statues of two of Korea's historical heroes. Also right by is a performing arts center, and a Palace Museum. It's at the heart of Seoul."
5079,4.0,"Let me start at the beginning: Gwanghwamun. It is picturesque and photograph-able from both Sajikno as well as the nearest traffic island on Sejongno.  Try to visit early to avoid the hoards of children on day trips from school and the tour bus crowd.  Once inside, if they are starting the pomp of the changing of the guard, I would use that as an opportunity to get a head start on the above mentioned, unless you're a huge fan of such proceedings.  The complex is quite large and some of the structures imposing but it sits on barren land (which I doubt was the situation when it was in use) which gives you the sense of emptiness.  Since it is a sprawling complex without a lot of reference points, I'd recommend either turning to the left or right once inside and working either clockwise or counter-clockwise, respectively, along the periphery. If you walk up the central path, there's a lot of nooks and crannies that you will miss.  Personal highlights were the Hyang-wonjong Pavilion at the far north of the complex and the view of Gyeonghoeru from across the water. The National Folklore Museum is supposed to be worthwhile but I was too hot and tired by the time I came upon it. It is scenic in its own right, with a 5 story pagoda perched on top.  The entrance fee is not that high, so it provides a good return on your investment."
5080,4.0,"I signed up for a free tour from the visitkorea.or.kr website and thoroughly enjoyed the place. The guide Jun, a retired South Korean volunteer, was excellent in giving our small group of four the background to the palace and use of different buildings in Gyeongbokgung. I learnt so much about this palace and its inhabitants during the Josen era in the two-hour tour, from why there are three entrance gates and why they have different heights to the different uses of the different kitchens in the palace. It was really intriguing to also see the sun dial invented during that period by one of the scholars and more importantly how it is used. Do I recommend this place? Yes but especially if you have a guide to help you fully appreciate the rich culture and history this palace embodies."
5081,5.0,It's very Korean!!! A must see attraction to visit downtown Seoul! Near to a Seoul Metro station very convenient and accessible to visit.
5082,5.0,"If you visit Korea there are numerous temples available to see, but this is as it states, a palace. The scale and workmanship is impressive and the changing of the guard is a spectacle worth seeing. Very peaceful place in the middle of a hectic city."
5083,5.0,If you visit seoul you must go to Gyeojgbokgung. It is very beautiful and very huge so prepare yourself with water and snakes if you have to but my advise is to eat well then go. It is much better to visit it early in the morning or after 11 I'm not sure which times it opens but after 4 pm will be so crowded
5084,5.0,This is one of the most visited Palace in Seoul. I would highly recommend visiting specially during the change of guard happens. I went twice during my trip because the first time it was raining and the next day the weather was beautiful so I went back to enjoy the sights and palace.
5085,4.0,"The biggest of the 3 main palaces in Seoul, it does stand out from the rest. It has late endless compounds . While the palaces seemed clean, they were hardly big or grand in comparison to some of the other countries like those in Thailand or India.  The good thing was that the place was maintained really really clean../""still if you are in Sepul, worth a visit"
5086,2.0,I preferred the Changdeokgung palace. This one felt more commercial. There was a huge platform constructed for a musical event. The changing of the guard was not waht I expected. Very disapponting
5087,4.0,"Watch the traditional Palace guards changing ceremony performed at the entrance. The palace grounds were massive, surrounded by situated at the foot of the northern mountains and great to exercise your feet. The buildings were beautifully restored, demonstrating the rich heritage of ancient Korean dynasty."
5088,3.0,"From far away the palaces felt majestic and remarkable, but going closer to the buildings one could feel that most buildings of the palace are replicates, given that the Japanese and the Korean War have destroyed most of the buildings.  There were tours given and if you did not have time to catch one could walk around the palace compounds and there are signs which give a brief historical summary of the uses of buildings.  Walking to places that were not allowed when guards were not looking was interesting. You could see the empty interiors of certain buildings and how they do not look authentic from the insides. On the other hand, there were some places not refurbished recently that gave the scenery for photography an authentic feel with aged wood and discoloured paint (after all, the original palace was not as colourful as it is today with the advent of modern dyes that were more vibrant)."
5089,5.0,"Is a big place, to really enjoy this place you need a bout 2 hours. If you like to take photos, you may need to allocate more time in this area."
5090,5.0,"Beautiful palace and a wonderful walk through history. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit there. The changing of the guard is short in timespan, but the colors were beautiful."
5091,4.0,"I enjoyed this palace. It is a very big area and you could be there for hours. There are some guards at the entrance in traditional dress so that is interesting. If you have been to China, this is very much the same as sites there. I visited quite a few in China, so just this one would have done me. If you have never seen anything like this then you must go."
5092,3.0,Good for history buff and also to witness the change of guards. Accessible by train (gyeongbokgung station exit 5) but shouldn't spend too much time here.
5093,4.0,"We visited the palace during Cheusok. It was fairly busy but the visitors were fairly pleasant. I don't know if it was due to the holiday or not, but there were quite a few young people in their traditional dress wandering the site. Their presence gave an authentic air to the visit that was exciting."
5094,3.0,"One of the few palaces in Seoul, a favourite amongst tourists.  It is small in size and if one has visit The Forbidden City in Beijing, this palace is much smaller in scale. It does not have the opulence and grandeur as normally seen in a palace.  Must understand the history behind the palace and how it was largely destroyed during the Japanese invasion and the palace was only rebuilt in the 1990s due to shortage of funds. So what we see now is a rather new landmark.  To make it interesting, one can also enjoy the walk around the palace in the traditional costumes i.e. hanbok but the rental shop isn't inside the palace, One has to rent from the shops outside the palace.  In my visit, it was really enjoyable to see a few local girls dressed in colourful hanbok, and they welcome picture moments with you."
5095,4.0,its like going back to the old time in Joseon era. like in the drama. the place is sooo good. dont walk too fast. you need to enjoy your time here..
5096,5.0,My wife and I really enjoyed the two hours we spent wandering around the palace grounds. The price of admission was low and the grounds are gorgeous. It is a wonderful place to walk around and soak in the beauty of the grounds and the landscapes around the palace area!
5097,5.0,"I enjoy walking the grounds at my leisure, soaking up the ambiance of the Joseon dynasty. Being on the palace grounds helps brings all those Joseon-era kdramas to life.  I have been to Seoul twice in the last 2 years and I have visited this particular palace both times. 2/2=100%"
5098,5.0,"It was a lovely early autumn visit, the surrounding trees just starts to turning yellow. A beautiful historical place to relax and enjoy."
5099,5.0,I strongly recommend a visit to the palace. We visited wirh out 4 years old son and had a lovely time. We started with the National folk museum and visited the palace on the way back to the metro station. I recommend this because you will experience much shorter waiting time to purchase a ticket
5100,5.0,Interesting Palace - free to over 65's! Lot of walking as it is very spread out. Worth a visit to aquaint yourself with it's history.
5101,4.0,"The grounds of this palace are expansive and you can wander around for hours, seeing the gardens, ornamental ponds and many palace buildings .You can also witness the colourful changing of the guards ceremony which is staged at regular intervals, or participate in a free english tour (these depart 3 or4 times a day). It does tend to lack a little character because basically all the buildings are new and there is nothing much inside the buildings to see (it was ""restored"" after being destroyed in the distant past). It also does get very crowded. However the entrance fee is a modest W3000 (or you can get a combined W10000 ticket and visit 4 sites within 3 months) and it makes for a pleasant diversion. You can also visit the folk museum at the side of the palace (for free) which also has a very interesting open-air section of historic shops, buildings and statues. Certainly worth a visit when in Seoul."
5102,5.0,"An interesting look at how the King use to live  I went in autumn and the scenery was really beautiful with the different coloured autumn leaves. The nicest view is one where the pavilion is.  They have scheduled tours but if you would like to walk around on your own but still get to know the history of the place, I would recommend to rent their audio tour where you can easily point to what you want to know (on the map) and listen to the historical facts. This is available in several languages."
5103,4.0,"We managed to catch the first changing of guards ceremony, which was quite interesting. The area is quite big and can get very crowded as well. The interior was alright but the view from the palace was awesome! I was told my the locals that this is not the most beautiful palace in Seoul though."
5104,5.0,"i don't know where or when but the moment i walked out the train station for this palace, i was in love. i had come just as the changing of the guards happened, it was so amazing. i can honestly say, i enjoyed everything, from the random pots of flower to maps in the floor. i had so much fun just walking around and taking pictures. you were able to view into the palace rooms but they were still in preserve. everything was perfect."
5105,5.0,Plan to visit 2 + hours and it is so fun to see the changing of the guards. Displays are good and the grounds are beautiful. We did this palace one day and the West Palace another day. Bothe were great and worth seeing but do it in in separate days to keep it from being overwhelming.
5106,5.0,We took a taxi from our hotel to the palace. IIRC it cost about $30 round trip. We arrived in time for the changing of the guard ceremony which was nice. Also took a guided tour. We enjoyed touring the palace.
5107,5.0,"This is one of the palaces in Korea. It's very big, picturesque, and calming. Getting inside is not a problem at all. We went as part of the Incheon tour in between connecting flights. You can find them at strategic locations at the airport. We only paid around 5-8 USD for food. I highly recommend going via this tour if you ever find yourself at their airport."
5108,4.0,"Amazing with this Palace, it is very big place, we can see traditional korean palace with background modern korean skycrapper. But too many tourist/visitor as we visit"
5109,4.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is a beautiful place, well preserved and tourist friendly. You can practically take pictures anywhere, and at the same time learn about where the emperors of Korea used to hold their meetings and banquets. Place is huge with lots of touristsand be sure to bring a decent camera, as there are quite a number of things you should take photo of. Families with young children might want to consider bring a stroller as place is really huge and only transport is by foot."
5110,5.0,The palace has so much history. It is definitely one of the most famous palaces in Seoul that one has to visit. getting to palace is quite straightforward. Spend more time in the palace and explore all the rooms.
5111,4.0,"This place is really BIG but it was worth the visit! We joined the free guided tour so as to really understand the buildings in the palace grounds. Be prepared to do a lot of walking and follow the guide closely. Because of the size of the crowd that turn up on the day of the tour, sometimes the guide cannot afford to wait for everyone in the group to catch up since they have to keep the tour within the strict time slot."
5112,4.0,"In a previous visit, I actually saw the museum and some of the palace, but I went back for a second visit to finally see the whole ace properly, and I'm glad I did. The queues o get into the main palace were very long, but pretty fast, and be sure to have your ID and stuff with you when you go, just in case. The whole place is beautiful, gardens, buildings and everything, with many photo opportunities. I stayed 'til after sun down and saw the lights come up and then it was a different beautiful all over agsin. Definitely recommended."
5113,5.0,"A beautiful place to walk around and take in the history and gardens. Time your visit for a guard changing ceremony to experience the theatre of the ceremony. Refreshment facilities are available but it's best to be self sufficient. There are plenty of places to stop and rest, but no substantial food to purchase. The gift shop offers some lovely options for souvenirs also."
5114,5.0,"Information points are in english as well. Take the tram tour when you get there. It follows the wall and allows you to cover more points in a shorter time. There are other guard towers that you can walk to and once you've seen a couple, you've seen them all, but it is a pretty cool experience. Their are random personnel dressed as warriors which makes it cool as well. At the INformation center where the tram drops you off at there is an archery range where you can pay to shoot a recurve type bow and arrows at wood targets. There is also the gift store with the archery range. Pretty cool experience overall."
5115,5.0,Huge palace. Beautiful infrastructure. It would've been good if they could place international language boards at each sight.
5116,3.0,The palace is nicely preserved.The entrance fee was trivial but it would be good to have a guide to explain the different rooms.
5117,5.0,Very amazing Korean architecture that has intricate details and I was very eager to see and understand more! Glad we got a guide for the tour to bring us around!
5118,4.0,Interesting history and especially when the King had guards watching when he defecated and smelled and tasted it to make sure he was healthy! THe changing of the guards was fun to watch as well.
5119,5.0,"Traditional palace located middle of city.  There is performance on certain time. Its free and looks nice.  In front of the 경복궁, there is a 광화문광장. I tried 한복 for free! Its not the traditional way to wearn but enough to get experience of wearing korean traditional clothes. It was really awesome."
5120,5.0,"If you set aside the history part (which is worth it in itself), it's absolutely beautiful and so big! The colors are unlike palaces in other countries. They also have free guided tours. Definitely worth it!"
5121,5.0,"This is great way to savor the culture of Korea, our group had a local guide who gave us specific details of the architecture and history of the palace.The Palace guards are very accommodating for photos."
5122,5.0,"It's a must to visit this wonderful place for any one who come to Seoul , here you will find the palace , monuments of the ancient loyal family , the wonderful park behind the palace , it's so good time you take for the family and any tourist who travel"
5123,3.0,Got there just on changing of the guards so there were bus loads of tourists which made the area very crowded making what should be a peaceful place rather hectic. Had a better experience at other palaces.
5124,5.0,Start at the gate and try to catch the changing of the guard..check for times.. we were able to don the uniforms after the change in the courtyard..tons of fun. Then stroll around the massive complex of structures and visit the adjoining museum to get the history of the dynasty. Walking further through the grounds will take you to the folklore art museum which was included in the price. Overwhelming and informative.
5125,4.0,"We got there just before the changing of the guards, so we were able to see the ceremony. A photo opp.  The palace was interesting. There's a lot of history behind it, so I hope you have a knowledgeable tour guide."
5126,5.0,very interesting and stunning introduction to traditional Korean architecture. Definitely good to purchase a printed guide (inexpensive) or take a guided tour.
5127,5.0,Well worth a visit while you are in the area Excellently maintained and spotlessly clean We arrived just in time to catch the changing of the guard with this adding to the magic enchantment of this beautiful palace
5128,4.0,"There's not much of ancient Korean history you can see in Seoul. And this palace is a must see. However it is less well maintained and less impressive than, say, its equivalents in Japan. (I realize that 35 years of Japanese colonial rule may have contributed to the comparatively poor state of Seoul's palaces). I would also replace the thin sand with gravel (grass?) as ground cover. Otherwise it feels a bit dusty."
5129,5.0,The palace was overwhelming but I completeley enjoyed the tour. It was very informative in terms of Korean history.
5130,4.0,"Worth visiting if you want to see beautiful palace grounds but could only look inside the windows. Also, I wish tour guide spoke better english."
5131,4.0,"This is the biggest and most impressive of the 5 palaces in Seoul. Its also the most visited, and does get pretty busy. Its totally worth getting an audio guide, to learn more about the buildings and the grounds. And make sure that you dont miss the guard changing ceremony. According to my guidebook its happening every hour, but actually its only every second hour, so you may want to check this in advance."
5132,4.0,"It's a perfect blend of nature and hystorical place. The place and palace it self is a very iconic, it's a must take a selfie spot. Inside, you'll see a beautiful lake and a scenic mountain. For a first timer in Korea, this is a lovely place. Get your camera ready and load it up with lotsa pictures!"
5133,4.0,"A must for anyone's visit to Seoul. Access to the entire Palace grounds is provided so that one can experience at their own pace the lifestyle of Korean royalty. See the conservative nature of the Confucian royalty. From throne room, to living quarters, to the changing of the guard dressed in traditional Korea military garb, the visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace is a pleasant adventure."
5134,3.0,"1 hour tops. Zip through. Take a few photos. Read a few signsZip out. I love history, but not with thousands of people elbowing me."
5135,4.0,"Changing guards ceremony was amazing, it's a colourful event with flags, trumpets and a loud drum. definitely a must see attraction, combines the harmony of nature and the orientalist architecture."
5136,4.0,"This is an awesome palace, not unlike the Forbidden city in Beijing, in terms of its design and magnitude. We were fortunate to get there just in time for the changing of the guards, at the front of the palace. The guards with their uniform fake moustaches and goatee beards were a funny sight to behold. There was an entrance fee involved, but good to know that anyone over the age of 65 gets to enter free. There were 3 main pavilions leading oneself to the back, where the kitchen and living quarters were located. My favourite building would have to be the one standing on v high stilts, surrounded by a moat /pond......absolutely beautiful and tranquil. We were able to appreciate the stark contrast between this complex of ancient buildings and all the futuristic skyscrapers in its backdrop. This palace is very well maintained. And worth a visit."
5137,5.0,"beautiful palace, with lily ponds, and gorgeous views of the mountains behind, this is a gem, glad we took the time to go visit!"
5138,3.0,"I know that I am in the minority here, but if you have visited other palaces in Asia - for instance in Beijing - then this place will definitely pale in comparison. It is still interesting, and the architecture is beautiful, but it is a style that is found in other palaces. If this is your first trip to Asia, this will be interesting."
5139,5.0,"The Palace is a very popular spot with Tourist, so it is crowded all day. Take a pair of good walking shoes with you, because the visit takes about 3-4 hours on foot. If possible , try to visit around lunch time, between 12-13:30, when most of the Tour groups would be on lunch break."
5140,3.0,"Beautiful palace and was lucky enough to catch the changing of guards process. On the general Seoul tourist website, it only mentioned the time was at 10am, but it changes guards 3 times a day. !0 am, 1 pm and 3 pm."
5141,5.0,"Changing of the guards is at 11:00am , 1:00 pm and 3:00 pm. It’s nice to watch the changing of the guards as it will give you an Idea on the Korean culture. There are scheduled tours around the palace with different languages. Get ready to walk and walk and walk under the sun (it depends on the season as we went there during summer), but it’s definitely worth it."
5142,5.0,Free to see the changing of the guard which happens several times a day. Long parade with Korean music and traditional costumes to get the guards in place to make the changing of the guards. Those 65 or older can show passport and get free admission ticket at the ticket booth.
5143,4.0,The changing of the guards is worth the visit. It is a large place and wheelchairs are available if needed.  A college student offered us a free folk museum tour in English which was very thorough and interesting.
5144,5.0,It is great to visit the palace. The guides are good and it is so large that you can feel the silence everywhere..even when it is very crowdy
5145,4.0,"Very cheap admission although a bit disappointed that none of the buildings had any furniture in them, unlike when visiting a British stately home for example."
5146,5.0,"I have seen the Gyeongbokgung Palace several times in Korean dramas, and was really excited to visit this palace. I visited the Palace on a weekday, in the early morning where there were less people. At the ticketing office, a cheap information booklet is sold for 500won that offers a comprehensive walking guide to the palace. I spent the day walking around the palace, admiring the architecture of the palace, including the huge Gyeonghoeru. The Hwangwonjeong was also a very serene place to take a break. The palace was linked to the National Museum of Korea where a huge collection of the Royal History of Korea is housed. Their gift shop also offers a huge selection of Korean history and culture books in English, of which I got a few."
5147,5.0,"The palace complex is huge, and the entrance fee is relatively inexpensive. Walking through the palace complex allows for one to experience the rich culture and history of Korea."
5148,5.0,"There's a museum there, and other museums nearby too like the Museum of Contemporary Art within 2 minutes walking distance which you can pair with this trip.  The weather was good when we visited and it was lovely walking the palace grounds. The museum is a 3 level, informative place that brings you back to the olden times with many real artifacts nicely preserved.  Titles and descriptions come in Korean, English and Mandarin and the place is spacious and neat.  Definitely worth the visit here to learn about Korean history."
5149,5.0,This is the replica of the palace from the last Joseon dynasty since the original structure was destroyed during the Japanese occupation. It's about 3 dollars to enter and they have free English tours available which takes about an hour . The changing of the guard parade is really colorful and you can take pictures near the guards but you can't really touch or get too close to them. It's really big and in the summer can really get hot so bring provisions. At the back there's a gate where you can pass to get near the Blue Palace for some photo ops.
5150,4.0,"Worth visiting. Come just before 1pm, as this is when the change of the guards ceremony begins. Then, you can have a guided tour (about one hour, but worth it to get some explanations on the palace and its history.) There's an English tour at 1:30 pm."
5151,5.0,"Even though the palace is a reconstruction, it has been beautifully recreated in every detail. I arived there early as to avoid the crowds as by the time i left it was started to fill up. The whole palace complex is HUGE! It does take a bit of time to walk around it. There some wonderful buildings here."
5152,3.0,"The area of the palace is very large, so it takes a lot of walking to visit everything. I used English audio guide, which told me details of every building and gate, what was it's purpose, when it was destroyed and rebuilt, but I missed general history of the palace.  Buildings are very pretty and well preserved, with beautiful paintings on the wooden ceilings and walls. However, they are all very similar to each other. You can't enter them, but you can look through the windows, and they are all almost empty.  The best for me were ponds and garden. You can't even get close to the buildings on the ponds, but even from the distance you can tell it's something different.  It took me over 2 hours, and it was hot day. If you visit on such a day, don't forget to bring a bottle of water."
5153,3.0,"I used the Free English tour. You learn a little history - get told your ticket gets you into the folk museum next door (which I actually found more interesting).  The Korean psyche has zero time for the Japanese who raped the country and its occupants over a 40 year period until they got nuked.  During this period this Palace which once comprised 550 buildings was reduced to one or two so what you see is a reconstruction in progress.  Something you have to get used to because if the Japanese did not blow it up, tear it down or use it for target practice then fire will have reduced it to cinders at least once and possibly several times."
5154,4.0,"A great place to walk around, especially in the fall or spring. Large tours visit regularly on weekends, however."
5155,5.0,It's so neat to see the historic restored houses/palaces set up in the middle of the city. It's a larger area than I had expected. Good for an afternoon trip.
5156,3.0,"If you are a Korean history craze or k drama fans, you may not find it interesting. It is clean, well kept but simple and small scale if compare to China. Should visit once but won't go back. It is close to the famous ginseng chicken soup place. Can walk there after your visit."
5157,5.0,I was completely in awe of this palace. We spent hours exploring the grounds and taking pictures. The architecture and history in this place are not to be missed!!
5158,5.0,"I went here first thing in the morning. To beat the crowd but even after every one showed up it was still fantastic. Alot of temples and history. Expect to spend about 3 hours including the museum, which is a must sea as well."
5159,3.0,"A vast, sprawling and frankly uninspiring estate of allegedly very old palace buildings, of which all were empty inside, and which had been so thoroughly refurbished in and out it looked as though they'd been built last year. There are vast open flagged spaces between each of the buildings, and probably the least unattractive is the one in the picture on Tripadvisor. There is the changing of the guard - a bit of a Disney luridly-coloured 'show'. with the actors not looking as though they're enjoying it much either. What saves it is the intricate tilework, soffits and external dressing of the buildings, which are worth photographing. There are barely any cafes inside so bring plenty of water."
5160,5.0,I did my daughter's first birthday photo shoot here. Well maintained. Huge. too much walking and too much to look around. Best to visit in fall or spring. Palace tours available in different languages.
5161,4.0,"need to relax and free your mind from shopping and eating, this is the place to be for a little peaceful getaway, very romantic and photogenic place, it does require walking as you would in the shopping mall but the difference is, you are actually spending quality time with you loved ones and bonding with your soulmate."
5162,5.0,We spent a couple of hours looking around this beautiful palace. I've not seen anything like this before right in the centre of the city. The architecture and the gardens are amazing at every turn. You really get a feel of how things used to be and you forget you are in the biggest city in South Korea!  Highly recommended especially if the weather is good.
5163,4.0,"Cheap to visit at 3000KRW! The place is huge and a lot of walking is required.  Interesting change of guards every hour from 9am to 3pm.  You get to see the Emperor's court and his throne, concubines' rest quarters, servants area, a beautiful lake and a museum.  Good place for photography."
5164,5.0,"inside center of the city,you can find such a beautiful place to explorer.good place to relax when you tired of noise and shopping."
5165,4.0,"a palace that you should see. Very easy to reach, because the subway connected directly to the place."
5166,4.0,"Definitely the top palace to visit when in Seoul. If you go, the morning changing of the guards is a must see (longer than the rest). A great expansive property to explore and hard to believe it's only 10% of the size it once was!"
5167,5.0,"wonderful place, romantic, great to take pictures, in the middle of the city center, also special night visits possible"
5168,3.0,Would be better if some description can be put in front of each of the rooms. I asked for digital guide but the staff seems did not understand.
5169,5.0,"Wow, beautiful palace and so unique. We didn't go inside but we're already so much impressed with the beautiful and immense outside. Watch the nicely dressed guard in their original costumes at the front gate. From you walk in 10 min to Insadong"
5170,5.0,"As a local people in Seoul, I think from time to time what place should I recommend to foreign people visiting Seoul, Korea. Several palaces, and Jongmyo Shrine is the first places to recommend. Korean palaces are relatively small compared with palaces in other countries (for example, the forbidden city in Beijing). So for someone who think size matters, this palace is not an impressive place. I just hope tour guide can properly explain the history, culture, and architecture of this palace."
5171,4.0,It is a beautiful palace! With a nice park around the palace. But the other famous palace which is bigger looks exactly the same. I recommend going to one of the palaces if you don't have that much time.
5172,4.0,"Plan on spending at least a few hours at this extensive and very picturesque location which comprises quite a number of buildings, plus a museum on Korean culture and history."
5173,5.0,I would recommend visiting here if you are in the area!! We had a lot of fun and really enjoyed our time here. LOVED IT!!!
5174,4.0,Great palace to visit -- Would recommend to more detail in English or English speaking tour guide to get full effect of site -- Beautiful Palace
5175,3.0,"It is undeniably a must place to visit in Seoul, it is unique because it is an ancient palace surrounded by the skyscrapers out there. You can see a contradictive view. The only downside is that tourists can just have a look at the building but not inside the building. I would like to see how does inside look like for bedroom and kitchen."
5176,4.0,"There is a reason why this place does not get an excellent review from me but let me tell you about the Pro's first. A great place to be for families who wants to visit and explore the palace and while many think that the place is just touch and go, you are wrong, this place is fairly huge. My cousin and me walked around the area for at least 2 hours before we decided to go. At certain part of the day, there will be some performance by the Korean citizens to portray how the guards used to do during their change of guard ceremony. At certain days, you can even try out their traditional clothing.  The cons is that it is closed on Tuesday and although I have been here for 3 times, the traditional wear area was always close. Not sure if it will get open anytime soon though. This is the only downside but overall, I would recommend anyone who has never visited an ancient palace to come and visit"
5177,4.0,"This building says it all. A traditional palace with a great structure, great architectural concept and great art."
5178,4.0,"IfFyou travel to seoul dont miss this one. And the ceremony too. Its really large area i think,but its nice"
5179,5.0,"Very traditional palace, with beautiful gardens and constructions. Inside there is an interesting museum about Korean history and culture worth the visit. The guards of the palace dress typically as in Joseon Dynasty."
5180,5.0,"A must see whilst in Seoul,amazing history and the buildings are stunning.Take your time and see everything,it was very hot while we were there so take a lot of water with you,having a guide was also a must have as the knowledge they give you is something you could not get on your own. We so loved South Korea."
5181,5.0,Changing of the guards ceremony was amazing. All the uniforms were so colourful. Don't miss this event. Not sure how often it happens each day.
5182,4.0,"Went during winter. Its beautiful and amazing. The snow, frozen lake and etc. Would love to go again on other season."
5183,5.0,The change of guard procession was interesting. Bring a hat and plenty of water when visiting during those hot days. A must-see when visiting Seoul.
5184,5.0,I took the english tour. I think they are open everyday and every 2 hours. It took about 2 hours and it was very informative. The palace ground is very large and beautiful. You can take the tour and ask questions or leave and wander around yourself. It's a good way to meet new people in your group who speak the same language or take pictures for you. Very recommended. I got great photos from it
5185,5.0,"My perception of Seoul before actually visiting was that is a largely artificial city with no real history or culture relative to places like Hong Kong. Seeing Gyeongbokgung Palace and a some of the other cultural sights during my visit proved me wrong.  I happened to arrive around when an English language tour was about to begin, so I joined up (it was free). I won't give any spoilers, but the guide helped me understand why Seoul might not have quite as much of its pre-modern history on display compared to some other cities.  Further, the on-going work to rebuild Seoul's heritage sites is impressive and uplifting. I'll look forward to future visits to see it unfold."
5186,5.0,"If you visit Seoul and don't see this palace, you need a doctor. It's like visiting Beijing without seeing the Imperial Palace.  Try to check the times for the changing of the guards. It's a colourful event with flags, trumpets and a loud drum. Kids will love it. The best views are are on the left side or near the front gate.  Guided tours are handy, but it's fun to stroll at your own pace. The palace grounds are greener near the left side at the back, cwhere you'll find a small lake. This area also has more ornate decorations and several gates and doorways.  The palace rents out baby strollers, but the large cobblestones will give your child a serious massage."
5187,5.0,"It is one of the main attractions of Seoul together with the Seoul tower and other famous neighbourhoods like hongdae, gangnam and itaewon"
5188,5.0,This is the biggest palace in Korea. So large that it took hours to complete the sightseeing in the inside of the palace.
5189,4.0,I recommend a tour because I regret not getting one. It was still interesting and worth seeing. The temples have a lot of beauty and great detail to them. I expected more greenery but I'm assuming that's too much for cost of upkeep
5190,5.0,Visited this palace with my aunt. It was big and beautiful and although filled with people it just felt desolate...like just imagine how it was when a dynasty lived there. Just open space. Like all palaces the design is colorful and bright with flowers in the cut outs and trim.  The changing of the palace guards was a big to do...there was this whole official ceremony and everything and that was really amazing to see.
5191,5.0,I love Korea culture so i was so happy to visit here. Many places I seen in movies and very large. I spent many hours here. People were friendly and I loved the folk museum. It can be crowded so go day time.
5192,5.0,"From entering this palace... you are just in awe of its sculptures, scenery and the colourful guards... You will see many building types, including pagodas, a huge museum of korean life, a street village and plenty of gardens for picnics.. Its amazing. Well worth a visit."
5193,5.0,A beautiful palace in the middle of Seoul. This place has some amazing photography options. They just opened a new part on the east side which is great for the photo lovers. You could spend all day here if you wanted. And dont forget about the free museum in the back right of the Palace.
5194,5.0,This is quiet and neat place  If you want to feel korean culture You should visit here Must visit place
5195,4.0,"This is a massive complex on the edge of the city centre. It takes a couple of hours to do it justice, so dress appropriately and don't forget the umbrella."
5196,5.0,Well maintain palace with a picture perfect view! Need to purchase a ticket to go in and worth every penny. The palace is big and there is a tour in the preference language but please check the time!
5197,4.0,"A prominent tourist attraction, this palace is on the A list of most tourists. The palace and its surroundings are kept to be pristine so as not to damage or harm its antiquity. Hence, tourists can only observe the palace from outside although they can still wander around the site. The weather is very humid and hot in summer esp. because of the lack of trees around the complex. Still, this palace is worth the while."
5198,5.0,"This is closed to insa-dong . One can walk this palace before walking around insa -dong, and some of the old ancient looking house. Sovereign is better price here."
5199,5.0,"i like walking in this palace, ever though sometimes its kind of busy but still a good place for talk a walk, growing the inner peace and taking a photograph esp in the spring and autumn"
5200,5.0,"The palace was really easy to get to if you take the subway. Entrance was 3,000 won. You could purchase a combination book that included tickets to other palaces for 10,000 won. The book is good for 3 months. The grounds definitely involved a lot of walking, so make sure to bring some water! Great tour!"
5201,4.0,Very interesting to learn a bit about Korean history. It was well worth waiting for the free English tour. The guide spoke English well and was very obliging.
5202,5.0,I highly recommend it. All the temples that you can see in Korea are simply great and all of them have English tours for free. It could not be better.
5203,4.0,"It is not the most beautiful palace of Joseon Dynasty, but it functioned as the main palace. You can feel the Joseon in the palace. Don't forget to dress up as Korean Traditional, Hanbok. Free admission!! Public Transportation recommended."
5204,4.0,A wonderful surprise when you first glimpse the palace across the courtyard. Colourful guards defend the front gates. Such a spectacle. Miles of buildings and then out to the park at the rear. Cross to the folk museum for another look at the history of the Korean people. A great day out.
5205,5.0,"histirical beautifully constructrd koearian palace, nicely dressed soldiers and the gardens sorrounding the complex give you the feeling like you are traveling in time and live with ancient Korean kings.  there are good tour guide who lead the tourists and give information about every single corner of the palace, free of charge."
5206,5.0,"This is a great place to spend a couple of hours. The history is fascinating about the Japanese occupation and impact on this site. Beautiful lake and a very calming vista over the waterlilies, especially on a hot day. Architecture is interesting to see how the Korean's design their palaces. It is also free to visit on Liberation day, 15 August. The locals love it as well, so it can be a bit crowded on the 15th."
5207,5.0,"Most of the buildings you see at this palace complex, including the main throne hall and the famous front gate, are recent reconstructions. This palace is in fact one of the least historically authentic ones in Seoul, not to mention crowded. As a Seoul resident, I mainly come for the 2 museums on the palace grounds, the National Palace Museum and the National Folk Museum. The former has a good restaurant and a brilliant shop."
5208,4.0,Busy road to cross to get to the palace. Enjoyed seeing the changing of the guards. Large compound which was impressive to walk around but busy and pushy crowds to go into the actual temples.
5209,4.0,This is a must visit palace and garden. Really worth it! Middle of the city! For small kids it can be a bit to big as you can walk around for hours.
5210,3.0,Worth to see. Not too old. Needs lots of walking to see all the palace areas and many uphill and downhill..
5211,4.0,"Right in the heart of Seoul, this is a must-do if you are interested in learning about the history of Korea. The palace grounds are beautiful. Be sure to do yourself a favor and hook up with a tour guide so you can learn as much as possible. And bring your camera because the sites are amazing"
5212,4.0,"It was very big and and very empty because I went during the MERS scare. Beautiful architecture. If you want a tour guide, you have to call ahead. I got to go to a small building that is normally off limits."
5213,4.0,"cultured and heritage always one of the best thing/place to visited especially when they have and related with long great history. the scenery was awesome and the environment was really harmony. as advise, you should have more than 3 hours if you want to finish visit this place or maybe more than that.. its really big and really nice..."
5214,4.0,"This palace was visited as we had 10 days in Seoul. I personally found that when you visited the first couple of temple's everything seemed the same. There were some nice lakes and an interesting museum to look at the history of south Korea however, 2 to 3 hours was enough for me. The war museum is a must. It deserves to be no 1 on trip advisor."
5215,5.0,"Great place to spend some time imagining how life was like. Excellent museum of the palace as well, just to the left when you come in the main gate. Try to catch the changing of the guard for a ceremonial treat!"
5216,5.0,"This is a very beautiful place to visit and take photos (you do not need a long time there)our tour guide from ""Korea private tour"" was great"
5217,3.0,The Korean people lost generations of culture and history though the Japanese occupation so what you see is not original but its also not to be missed. Please visit as it gives a wonderful insight into a Korea in the past. If you are familiar with Chinese or Vietnamese architecture it is worth gettin an informed guide to explain the subtle differences between each culture. They may look the same but they aren't.
5218,4.0,"Cultural heritage never seized to amaze me everywhere I go to a palace or castle.  Preserve well, and the details is superb. The museum is a breeze and easy to learn.. Need more english explanation though..  Must visit..."
5219,4.0,"A really nice place to go to, when I went there it wasn't to crowded so it was really nice to just walk around and enjoy the scenery, see all the old buildings, see the gardens and the ponds was especially nice and quiet."
5220,3.0,"If you are into the history of Korea then this is a must see. I am not, but I learned alot on the tour about the history of korea, the living conditions of royalty as well as the servants etc. The architecture was amazing, the amount of detail in the painting was impressive. Glad we went."
5221,5.0,Importnat and one of the five palaces in Seoul. Very typical structure for Corea and exciting structure.
5222,4.0,Amazing photo opportunities with a wealth of history and culture. Definitely a must see location of South Korea. Interesting architecture and stories of the past.
5223,5.0,"I was so impressed with Gyeonbokgung Palace. It is very well maintained and very easy to get to. Take a subway ride, come up the stairs and there you are. Truly amazing how they have kept this beautiful piece of history in the middle of skyscrapers and buildings. They offer free guided tours and I really suggest taking one. If you go in the summer months be sure to take lots of water, an umbrella and a hand fan as there is no shade. Pictures will not even do justice of how amazing the palace was."
5224,5.0,"Very beautiful with lots of history and a lovely garden, located very centrally so other attractions around. Don't miss this if you're in Seoul."
5225,5.0,"A must see when traveling to Seoul. There is much history in beauty in this palace! The Joseon period is a huge part of Korean history. I highly recommend doing a guided tour; they're free and happen multiple times everyday. The tour guides know a lot about the place and its history, and you see a lot of the palace without getting overwhelmed by its complexity."
5226,4.0,"Immersed ourselves into this really ancient romantic palace! Wearing the ""hanbok"" taking photos! The roofs and exterior façade were exquisitely done up! Check out the Pagoda nearby!"
5227,5.0,"Must do visit of a stunning, over 700 year old main Korean royal palace in central Seoul. Closed on Tuesdays."
5228,5.0,"Basically everything in Seoul is crowded, and this place is no exception. There are some lesser-known palaces around the downtown area that are equally beautiful (if not as huge). I prefer them, actually, over this palace. (Changdeokgung)  Insider tip: if you're visiting in the summer with little kids, let them play in the fountain directly in front of the palace. It's a bit of a hike from the front gate, but a great way to avoid a kid with a case of the grumpies."
5229,4.0,"This was a great experience, i thought the arhictecture was so interesting, and gives a real feeling of traditional korea. even though it was very rainy, there were still many tourists which is understandable as its an outstanding palace. I would recommend not going during monsoon rainy season though if possible."
5230,5.0,"Very nice park. Beautiful building, with 2 descriptions: English and Korean. Enter cost 3$, I was on Saturday day and it wasn't full of people."
5231,5.0,"You can introduce by yourself in Korean History, you can feel in the time of these palaces and close your eyes and to imagine beeing inside the palace some hundreds of years ago, really is phantastic to transport in the time, all you need is imagination and to look slow every passage of korean history and to read and understand the texts of every place in the way."
5232,4.0,"The visit to Gyeongbok Palace was one of the highlights of my trip. I was able to be there at 10AM for the changing of the guard. I loved seeing the colorful uniforms and hearing the traditional drum being hit. Later I was able to sit near the pond where the King used to entertain and throw parties. The architecture is wonderful, as well. Lots of walking. I recommend bringing an umbrella for shade during the summer months."
5233,4.0,"well. you're not going to Korea if you're not going to this palace! it's true guys, i'm not kidding. I've seen a lot of korean palace in korean dramas, but never thought the history behind it. lucky me, when i was there, there was a free english tour guide to lead us about this palace, it's really worth my time"
5234,4.0,"On a glorious sunny early summer day, I had the opportunity to enjoy some of the sights of Seoul, that bustling Korean metropolis that is surprisingly (for a Westerner) full of unexplored history. My first stop was the Gyeongbokgung Palace just near the Presidential Palace and the centre of the business district around Jongno-gu. A bit of history from the official guide. The first palace buildings were built in 1395, three years after the Joseon Dynasty was founded by King Taejo (Yi Seong-gye) after the capital of the newly founded dynasty moved from Gaeseong to Seoul (then known as Hanyang). The entrance is a grand courtyard, similar to the classic imperial Chinese design for the Forbidden Palace, it is breathtaking! After then, a range of buildings, temples and garden lakes were constructed and which survived until the Japanese occupation resulted in almost all buildings being dismantled. Now, lovingly rebuilt, they exude peace and harmony with a dose of tranquillity around the gardens and lake. A great place to visit during a free couple of hours and in the heat of early summer, bring plenty of water.."
5235,4.0,"Stunning in size and culture. One of the top two palaces to see while in Seoul. Make sure to get in before too late in the day when they stop letting people in, you need sufficient time to visit around!"
5236,3.0,"The gardens in this palace are very lovely and relaxing place to walk around. We came here on the weekend and although it was a bit crowded, you did not get the crowded feeling while walking in the gardens. The infomation about the history of the palace was a bit limited."
5237,5.0,"A true icon of korea. To really appreciate this country, you must most definitely need to see the palace! A lovely place. Plan at 3 hours to get around the big place. I love it here. Been 12 plus times!!!!!"
5238,4.0,Beautiful architecture and a charming man-made pond inside. Perfect place for k-pop fanatics to visit.
5239,4.0,We visited the palace and we're lucky to start by watching the guards change performance. The visit was enjoyable. At the end we entered the attached museum which was fascinating. The only problem was the hot weather did not help us to enjoy the palace outdoor.
5240,5.0,"I visited this place with my host. She told me stories of how she use to come here and played when she was a kid. Then she told me stories of how she brought her kids here. I think hearing her stories and hearing about the history of the palace gave me more of an understanding of what this palace meant to Koreans. It was a really wonderful place. It is the perfect place to see and feel the past, present and future."
5241,4.0,The Palace is the largest in the Seoul and dates back to the late 1300's. The grounds are large with many buildings and 2 lakes. It's a marvel to see the work of all artisans that created all the buildings and landscaping. It's like going back in time...
5242,5.0,Golden roof of Kings Room is totally amazing. Excellent guide and well described. Number one place to visit.
5243,4.0,"Definitely worth a visit, nice buildings and if lucky get to see change of the guard in the traditional gear."
5244,5.0,The biggest palace resides in the heart of Seoul.Entrance fee: about 5 US$. Free guided tour in English - check the information for details. Fabulous building and history
5245,4.0,Please plant more trees for shade. It's quiet beautiful but sometimes it just get's too hot during summer.
5246,4.0,Beautiful Palace and Gardens. We also arrived just in time to see to changing of the guards. Very spacious so be prepared for a lot of walking. Museum next door provide very educational historical background of Korea. We went during July when all public tours were free.
5247,5.0,"The Palace is very beautiful and worth a visit, it was in my opinion the most beautiful thing I saw in Seoul. At the entrance to the palace you can see the traditional guards and there are various events during the day that you can watch, such as the change of the guards. At the entrance there is a sign with the timetable for these events, it is worth to wait for one of them!"
5248,5.0,Had the opportunity to see the changing of the guard and English speaking tour of the palace. There was a special tour of the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion - Korean language only. But the guide found me prior to the tour and gave me an overview. This tour is only available for a short period of time - so glad I was able to see this peaceful palace.
5249,5.0,Very beautiful. The best out of the 4 palaces in Korea. It is optional to buy a group pass to visit all 4 palaces. I will not recommend it unless you have plenty of time to visit all 4 palaces. Its pretty much the same.
5250,5.0,"This is a very beautiful palace and is worth the visit. We just arrived at the end of the 10am changing of the guards and you should make a note to arrive to see the whole thing. Apparently the ceremony is conducted several times a day and is full of pomp and noise, but is fun."
5251,5.0,"From our hotel Biwon, that was not so far to get on this royal great place. It is one of the five Seoul and surely Korean sites,that count as the World Heritage Centres of the world. We headed along the Yulgok Road and got in the front of the main gate of the Royal Palace, that is, Gyeongbokgung Palace. Before we entered inside, or within the great square, stone paved, we witnessed to such great royal ceremony, that was done by the royal guard in the very beautiful red and blue costumes. Many of them carried the spears and royal flags. Took some pictures. Inside we found ourselves entouraged with tipically korean architectural design, presented by the buildings at one or two storeys, the wood fences, the stairways, that led to the doors of these houses of high noble men of old Korean royalty. This palace was built by the Joseon dynasty in 1395, one of the most important dynasties throughout the whole history of Korea.On the site there are five grand palaces. This place have had the turbulent history, the palace was two times demolished. First time it was during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592 - 1598) and second time, it was in the more recent history, that is, in the years of repeated Japanese occupation of Korea, from 1910 until 1945. Really immense square, with the great blue sky above us, elegant, nice coloured palaces all around and large stone plates under the feet. Here again we saw the Royal Guard, this time in the procedure of changing the posts. The very beginning of our stay in Seoul, and how it was impressive !!"
5252,4.0,"I've been to all the other palaces but don't think I can pick a favorite. What's nice about this one is the size (it's the largest) and even though it tends to be the busiest there's a lot of ground and buildings so the people get spread out. A trip to this palace gives you the opportunity to visit the National Palace Museum or the National Folk Museum. I've been to both museums and don't consider them ""must sees"" but are nice if you have the time and if you only have time for one I would recommend the Folk museum over the Palace museum.  I've been here twice, once in the Spring and again in the Fall. Both times were beautiful because there was bloomed cherry blossoms in the Spring and colored leaves in the Fall.  9am-6pm, last admission at 5pm Adult 3,000won (about $3) 7-18 1,500won (about $1.50) 6 & under free Other Info: watch changing of the guard ceremony and have your picture taken with one, special night time openings Palace Website: www.royalpalace.go.kr"
5253,4.0,A must visit place in South Korea to have a glimpse of the country's rich history. Do not miss the royal changing of the guard when you visit.
5254,5.0,In chosun's palace is remains now. also there is so clean insid. Many drama is in this palace and maybe half thousand of history. I like this palace
5255,5.0,some of buildings are not original due to sad invasion history. there are many signs with good information on most of buildings. there are few museums right next to palace. take your time will take approx. 2~4 hours
5256,5.0,So good to see the palace in person. We saw this each time we watch historical Korean Dramas and being here just made it more real for us. So good that they maintained this.
5257,5.0,A glimpse of Korea during a different era. Make sure you are there for the changing of the guard ceremony
5258,4.0,"In retrospect, this place probably requires a tour guide. At least for the front section it's just a series of very open assembly spaces on sandy ground. We missed any gardens to see the changing of the guard (a bit anti-climactic). The price was right, though (thanks MERS). Perhaps a couple more information stations would have brought the place to life."
5259,5.0,This is one of the encient place in Korea. I have stepped up to this palace afternoon lazily after my tiredness of visiting Lotte World. But once i arrived there i become refreshes with this historical monument and it made worth of voting there. I would like to recumbent people to visit there once you are there in Seoul.
5260,5.0,"Our tour to the palace was fantastic. Already a fan of Asian imperial dramas, it was fun walking in the 'footsteps of kings' and imagining life in the past. The near by Museum was educational without being too encompassing and we were able to take in both before lunch."
5261,4.0,Nice place. High recommended to visit in Seoul. Be ready to do lots of walk. Many nice photo spots inside.
5262,5.0,"A must visit, Parade ceremony is a definitely not a miss.. have ample amount of time to visit the palace."
5263,5.0,"First time that i visited this country and city, and everyone told me ""you need to visit this palace"". They were not wrong. The palace is huge and is the best way to understand about the culture, the past and the difference between South Korea and the other asian countries. The entrance fee is not high, and also can buy one ticket that includes the visit to other palaces. Use comfortable clothes because you need to walk a lot but the views and buildings are amazing. Inside you can also visit one museum that is really nice. Amazing place for summer or winter!"
5264,5.0,"Other than the huge amount of visitors in the afternoon I have nothing bad to say about this palace. Very large, beautiful buildings and gardens. Especially the area around the pond is beautiful, quite easy to spend an entire afternoon exploring this palace!"
5265,4.0,"Coming from a very young modern country, visiting ancient historic sites like this is an eye opener. It is so enriching to learn about the rich culture of another country.  Gyeongbokgung Palace is a beautiful place to visit , a must see. It is a huge place, so be prepared to do some walking & spend some time here.  But it is worth it. After all, there are no better places to learn about another country's culture than actually visiting their historic sites."
5266,4.0,Great palace - try to go so that you can see the changing of the guard. Seemed like Fridays are the day to go if you aren't part of a tour group. We roamed here for 2 1/2 hours and still didn't see everything! There's no food sold here so bring a picnic/snacks if you plan on taking a break towards the back of the palace where there's benches to sit and eat under the trees.
5267,5.0,Yes it is one of the best attractions in Seoul. It is a very big palace with huge garden. Don't forget to wear very comfortable shoes to walk in. And if you have a Korean customs to wear this is the best place to take some photos while wearing their beautiful dresses It is very recommend to visit it during the guard change to see it.
5268,5.0,"Great priority palace to visit in Seoul. Be sure to go on the Secret Garden tour as well, then explore the neighborhood afterwards. Nice small eateries in close proximity."
5269,5.0,"As you'll read in other reviews, this place is huge! You can easily spend an entire afternoon here which should allow you to see everything. There's quite a bit of walking, but you get a good idea of the architecture and culture."
5270,3.0,"Went there at april 15 But if u want to see some sakura leafs I suggested u to go somewhere else  The place is huge Inside there are castles, folks houses, museums and also hanbok rental in the front of gate. Plenty of tourist when we went there  In my own opinion, i prefer to go to japan temple's or japan's castle But it still a place to go if you want to sightseeing at seoul"
5271,4.0,"The Palace was rather big, the atmosphere around the palace was very nice despite the large crowd. I think this place would be best visited in spring or autumn when the weather and temperature is just right."
5272,5.0,"We went to all the palaces in 1 day. This palace was pretty closed to where we were staying. This is considered the second most huge palace in Korea. On the day we went, there were free entrance for all tourists. I guessed this has to do with the recent MERS cases. There were not many people there. Was quite empty. Reached in time to see the changing of guards. Was pretty impressive with it. The changing of guards last around 15minutes. After which we headed inside the palace and it was HUGE!! You can view the beautifully structures of the palaces, the building of the home of the King and Queen. We spent an hour walking around and had our rest at a café in the palace itself."
5273,5.0,A pretty big palace. it's not as big as The Forbidden Palace in Beijing but it was nice. It definitely had the Korean architecture and culture. The pavilions were nice but pretty empty. Worth a visit!
5274,5.0,I was able to visit during a business trip and loved the beauty and history this provided. I did not get a guided tour which probably only adds to the experience but will loved my visit.
5275,3.0,"I spent little time there, mostly due to the great heat of the day. The palace seems to be mostly grounds (though I could be wrong about that). There are great local places to eat nearby."
5276,4.0,"The guided tour helps you understand and know what the palaces were about, the tour guide I had have good English but her voice volume was a bit too low."
5277,5.0,Beautiful! I went with an old roommate that I had while studying abroad in Korea. She was able to explain the details of the palace and give me some history. It is really pretty and I highly recommend it.
5278,5.0,"A nice place to spend a couple of hours just walking around, taking in the lovely gardens and historical buildings. Highly recommend it!"
5279,4.0,"Let us say that if there is only a palace to be seen or if you have little time in Seoul, it is good that one that it is necessary to visit. Attention the palace is closed for the visits on Tuesdays. Opening hours are from 9am to 6pm. Cost approximately 3'000 Won for entry and half for children until 18 year old.  The palace dates from the 14th century, and it extends over 40 hectares, it is a city in the city, count 2-3 hours to see the main buildings. A project of restructuring is in progress for a duration of 20 years reason why all the structures are not accessible.  NB: every hour there is a change of the guarding in the entrance of the palace which deserves to be seen with its traditions."
5280,5.0,"This palace is huge, you could literally spend all day there. The changing of the royal guard ceremony is fun to watch at the very front. The pond is beautiful! We were able to walk through and take pictures in front of the blue house and see the national folk museum of korea. If you can only see one temple in seoul id highly recommend this be the one!"
5281,4.0,This amazing old hunting park used to be the King favorite spot to chill. Now the public can visit this place and enjoy their time. The place is massive and tour guide are available. You can see the old Korean building and nice swamps. I highly recommended this place. Please wear sport shoe as it might be a long walking there.
5282,4.0,The place is huge! We spent about 30 minutes looking at everything. Absolutely worth seeing as it's convenient and is in the middle of town. We were in a rush so didn't go into the museum but it's definitely worth seeing if you are pressed for time and can only visit one palace.
5283,5.0,"The palace grounds are huge! Each building is so beautiful and unique, they're similar but completely different to Chinese or Japanese palaces (if that makes sense). There's a museum inside the grounds which you can enter with the palace ticket. There is a changing of the guards display every hour on the hour at the entrance. The palace is so easily accessible by metro, there's no excuse not to visit!"
5284,5.0,"Enjoyed a walk through this palace, partially with the English tour that`s included in the entry fee. The palace is really nice. The guided tour was informative and added to the experience, although the guide did go much in the detail neither followed a chronology.The only real disappointment is that you need to book in advance to enter the palace building on the west side (surrounded by a small pond)."
5285,5.0,"After wandering through all of Seoul's major palace complexes, I've picked Gyeongbokgung as my favorite. It is a huge complex with a number of beautifully designed buildings as well as a wonderful garden at the back. Although the garden at Gyeongbokgung Palace is not as big or as English-garden-like as the one at Changdokgung, it is a very pleasant an beautiful place to stroll through. Make sure to take the free guided tour and then wander around on your own as well because the tour doesn't cover everything (although the tour lasts for about an hour, the complex is just too huge). Try not to miss the guard changing ceremonies because they are a treat. The times are clearly marked at the notice boards as you enter. You can also try out the guard costumes at the building to the left as you enter through the main gate. It is open just before and after the guard changing ceremonies. Spots fill up quickly. Among all the palace complexes, this is the most archetypal, the biggest and perhaps the most majestic. Changgyeonggung has some of the most beautiful clusters of buildings though. There is no entry fee during July 2015."
5286,4.0,"Being the largest of the five palaces, I would say this is something you definitely should set aside time to see. The National Folk Museum of Korea is also within the premises, so make sure you have a few hours available. We spent 2,5 hours but didnt get around to see all the different buildings."
5287,4.0,"Much of the palace is reconstruction which lends a feel of in authenticity. Nevertheless, it is a lovely place to wander. A tranquil spot in the heart of Seoul."
5288,5.0,"this place is awesome! Dont miss the changing of guards program. Everything is well kept, will make you feel like you were transported to a different time."
5289,4.0,Great to visit and walk around when you are visiting the city. Beautiful gardens and well manicured grounds as you see all the history inside.
5290,4.0,"This is the biggest palace in Seoul, and definitely worth a visit if you're in town. It's not the most amazing thing I've ever seen, but it's a very scenic and pretty palace with a massive area to walk around on a nice day.  Also it was free during July 2015 so that's a bonus! Go now if you're here this month."
5291,3.0,"It was great! We took lots of pictures, because of course the place was beautiful.  There were also free tours on specific times in different languages.  It was a long walk back, because from after the tour, you have to go all the way back. there is no other exit, except from where you came in.  We tried to find one form another way, but there was really none.  It's a HUGE place."
5292,5.0,"In most places, the historical sites are usually a bit out of the way from the city. But not in Seoul, it's really interesting how the old palaces are intertwined in the very modern architecture. I went during a heavy rainstorm with thundering, so not the best time to go, but also allowed for some quite dramatic photos! Definitely worth checking out!"
5293,4.0,I visited this historical place during winter. It was a peaceful place and we can see the traditional architecture in this palace.
5294,5.0,"Definitely worth visiting! Beautiful, historically important location in the heart of a modern city. Tranquil, green, and pleasant."
5295,4.0,"The largest palace complex in Seoul. It has many buildings and each has its specific history, of course you'll have many photo spots. Don't miss the guard change ceremony at the gate. It is also near to the National Folk Museum. You'll need 1 to 2 hours to cover the whole complex."
5296,4.0,Not a great palace but one of the must see. It represents Korean traditional architecture. When you see other palaces around the world you might say this is not that great but definitely worth a visit
5297,5.0,"One of the best things to do in Seoul. The palace complex is large and reminds me a lot to the Beijing Forbidden city. The good things is that it is not obercrowded like the Beijing one, so you will really enjoy it!"
5298,4.0,"I like visiting historical places, and this one was no exception. I found royal Korean customs interesting when our tour guide narrated the events that transpired in the queen's chambers. Of course the traditional architecture was also something I really marveled at."
5299,5.0,Architecture at its best. You will find peace within yourself when you spend at least two hours in this place. Take some fresh air at the park and entertain your eyes with magnificent assets from the past at their National Folk Museum :)
5300,5.0,"This was our favourite palace in Seoul, it was close to our hotel and we were there in the morning when the guard change happened- don't miss this one (they do it few time a day). The palace is enormous but easily accessible even without a guided tour as we did. We bought a brochure where we bought the entrance tickets and it had a map and all the necessary information about the palace in it."
5301,5.0,"I went to the palace with a korean friend. The tour lady was very good, and let go a couple of funny jokes to lighten the atmosphere. The tour is 1h long, because the palace is so big. The architecture is beautiful. Simple yet refined, the wooden structures are assembled without any nails or metal and symbolize asian acient design. I think this is a classic visit on the Seoul To-do list."
5302,5.0,"I happened to be here during July which apparently all the palaces and museums are open for free!!! and also coincidently to have enjoyed the free guided tour provided by the palace, all of which has made the whole experience so much better!"
5303,4.0,"It is a beautiful historical Korean temple. We had just come from Beijing and went to the Forbidden City before arriving in Seoul, so in comparison, it is less impressive. Nonetheless, being Koreans from Los Angeles we were still very glad to have seen it."
5304,5.0,"A great palace to walk around. It is a part of Korean history. Even it is a replica, the original one was destroyed."
5305,4.0,"This palace has been destroyed, twice I think, so what you can see today has been entirely rebuilt. The grounds are huge and nice for a stroll around - but there isn't too much to see here in terms of exhibits, etc. The changing of the guard ceremony has interesting music and costumes and my kids really enjoyed seeing it."
5306,5.0,"This is a palace worth visiting. Main Royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty, this has a lot of architecture and numerous palaces rooms inside. One of the biggest palace in Korea."
5307,4.0,"Seoul at night is like a teenager who just discovered life after school. All of those who spent hours working, chasing deadlines, staying in on piece after meetings and reunions are the same that cluster bars, restaurants, plazas and more, giving this city an unique sense of dynamism and restlessness. That is why from time to time it is more than necessary to breathe and relax, and believe me, there is no better place in town for this action than the gardens of Gyeongbokgung Palace! Want to contemplate Korean architecture while promenading away from the intense rhythm of town? Well, think no more, this is your place."
5308,4.0,Enjoyed a free walking tour. The history and architecture is well worth the visit. Wear good walking shoes.
5309,4.0,Today I visited the palace and to my surprise the entrance fee was free. A sign was posted that named the other nearby palaces also as free for the month of July due to MERS. This palace was just as beautiful as the others that I visited on my trip to Korea. I also enjoyed the Korean Folk Museum which is also on the same grounds.
5310,5.0,Decided to do a palace tour via the subway. Subway was right next to the palace. You can buy a multi-ticket whilsy there. Gives you access to other palaces in the city. Worth it if you see 2 or more places. Good museum at the entrance too.
5311,4.0,"Located in the heart of downtown Seoul, Gyeongbokgung is an easy must-see visit. The Changing of the Guards ceremony welcomes most visitors. The first portions may have more visitors, but be sure to wander to the back parts as well. I especially liked the Parujeong building. Pavilions by the waters are particularly beautiful in spring and peaceful after an occasional snowfall. Amisan chimneys are noteworthy. Do visit the free Folk Museum, connected to the palace grounds."
5312,4.0,"Cheap admission (~ 3 USD) and worth to see the traditional face of Seoul and Korea. However, do not expect anything breathtaking."
5313,5.0,"Make sure to catch the changing of the guards in the afternoon! Love the ceremony and brightly colored attire.  This is closed on Tuesdays, by the way, so plan your Seoul itinerary accordingly."
5314,4.0,"A must visit for Seoul. See the changing of the guard and the elaborate show for tourists.  The grounds are nice enough, but not very large. Back then, it seems the Koreans were not that affluent when compared to China or Japan."
5315,4.0,"The best palace in Seoul. Gyeongbokgung is the largest and so I'd recommend choosing this one over any of the others. You have the addition of the National Folk Museum once you're inside. Tickets are dirt cheap! The palace isn't open on Tuesdays which I thought was a little odd but other than that, we had no problems getting in."
5316,5.0,I enjoyed walking around in the palace. It gives me a rough idea of the rich culture of Korea. Nice place to do photo taking and what makes me happy theres a free palace guard uniform wearing. My whole family manage to try the guard's uniform. We were able to watch also the guard changing ceremony. There is the restaurant and souvenir shop at the palace ground. Must see place.
5317,4.0,"If you are first timer in Seoul, include Gyeongbukgong Palace. Tagged as Palace blessed by the heavens. The largest among palaces in Seoul. One shouldnt miss watching Changing of Guards ceremony.. Relieve olden times and Be amazed looking inside Kings throne. They are just a few things to visit when youre inside the palace."
5318,4.0,"Beautiful Palace for Korean standards. However, if you have been to China or Japan you will be slightly disappointed. Nevertheless, definitely top of your list if visiting Seoul."
5319,3.0,It was quite boring as I not a history lover.The palace was well maintained and the area was quite big.Nice place to take pictures to proof that u had visited Korea.I watched the guard changing ceremony and it was quite nice so I gave this attraction three stars.
5320,4.0,"hundred years building, is a landmark of seoul, how well the palace is, and very easy to go, follow by train."
5321,4.0,"Beautiful,the museum is wonderful,if you visit during the autumn it's a bonus it looks wonderful with all the different colours"
5322,5.0,"This complex is huge and expect to wander through here for a day. If you're lucky, you will see reenactment of the palace guards and see it all lit up during the annual lotus lantern festival."
5323,5.0,"The palace is gorgeous and the ceremony of the change of guards is very entertaining and educational. Closed on Tuesdays but on all the other days the times are 9:00, 1:00 and 3:00.  Would recommend to those who want to see a little bit of the history of Seoul."
5324,4.0,"must see !! the garden was designed very beautiful. you will feel suprised with the pool, mandarin duck & birds inside the garden. even it's artificial garden but it's still looks natural."
5325,5.0,Just like any countries it is best to visit historical places . It is a huge place. The paintings on the wall of the place was intricate . They were able to preserve some of the furniture used in the olden time. However the bad side is that you can only look from the open windows as visitors are not allowed to enter the rooms.  Make sure to visit during the change of Guard! During morning and the one we watched was during the afternoon at around 3 P.M.
5326,5.0,"Biggest palace I visited in Seoul. Is worth paying the admission tickets and walking through. There is a lot to see. The architecture is amazing, leaning about the culture is fascinating. The changing of the guards is a great show. This place is a must see in Seoul."
5327,4.0,This palace captures the glorious history of Korea. This is very close to the Business Centre of the city and business travellers also can visit this place with just 1 hour break.
5328,4.0,the palace was the last home of the last remaining korean royal family. a place that has a lot of history and tragedy. its beautifully maintained
5329,5.0,"It is a very nice palace, and gives an interesting glimpse of the Korea history and culture. But, to me, the most interesting thing was the changing guard ceremony. Complete, with drums, music, everything. Just fantastic, do not miss it. Site has schedules. Beware, it is closed on mondays - not on tuesdays, as site says."
5330,4.0,I recalled all the K-dramas I watched set in the early history of Korea. It's a very huge place and it's great to note that reconstruction is currently ongoing at some parts. It's good how they continue to rebuild some of the parts of the palace. It shows how important and how they value the preservation of their culture. Changing of guards is one of the must watch activities when visiting. Tourists can also try to fit in the guard's costumes near the gate.
5331,5.0,"Visit this palace several times already,watch out for different exit. I always hear something new from tour guide when we visit this place so I always curious of any other story. You will see a palace complex with different usage, size and form. People in the old days really have great passion as you see on the building. This place is big and may be windy so prepare a jacket, March can still freeze you in this place. Take pictures with some buildings and as you walk out some dust may fly so walk slowly. For 1395 built, this palace still look amazing. Never iss this when you are in Seoul."
5332,5.0,"I and my family members enjoyed visiting this palace. And we had so much fun wearing the guard costumes and having some great photos, too. It was nice to see the moment of of guards changing the shifts."
5333,5.0,"every hour they change their gate guard and they performed guard changing ceremony, so nice and snappy to see. the palace was great and nice to visit."
5334,5.0,"This is definitely worth a visit, but you will enjoy exploring the palace more if you read a little about its history first. The lakes and gardens are a good place to take a break and rest a little while contemplating Joseon history."
5335,4.0,"We were there at sunset and stayed until dark. It was the perfect way to see it , since after dark it has a special magic. This should be on your shortlist if you are in the area."
5336,4.0,"So I came to visit this palace after visiting Tokyo's Imperial Palace 3 days prior. This one is a lot better and looks more authentic. There are free tours for various languages throughout the day. Make sure you get there on time, but even if you don't you can just search for the tour group and join them midway. They tour guides are very knowledgeable and they teach you a lot about the history of this palace. In my opinion, you need to visit this place with a guide otherwise you won't appreciate it's history and what each building represents.  It's better to go on a weekday. I did and there were plenty of areas where you can take photos without anyone in the background. Bring bottles of water with you because you are outdoors and it gets hot. There are no vendors except inside the museum, as far as I could tell."
5337,5.0,The temple isvery nicely located and full of peace the architecture is very beautiful and needs personal attentin The area is fully covered by beautiful old trees The templealso reflect the life style of the king
5338,4.0,I went with my mum to visit Seoul and for the pair of us we knew 0 Korean. It was definitely very easy to find the place and getting tickets was as easy as it could be with English and Chinese signs too.  The first thing we saw when we got there was the guard change over - I believe and it was really cool to see. The actual Palace itself was huge and you are free to look at most part. I really like it!
5339,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is the biggest palace in Seoul located in the center of the city.  Most of the area in the palace including the Throne Hall has been burnt but rebuilt is 20 century. You need at least 2-3 hours to walk around and to enjoy the great local Korean atmosphere with also group English speaker tour guide provided by the palace and it is free of charge. At every 2 pm the also have the guard patrolling show available at the main gate which worth to see and taking some photos too.  Within the palace, there is 2 museum available one is National Palace Museum and the other one is Korean Folk Museum, if you only have enough time to choose one only, the palace museum is what I would recommend."
5340,5.0,"Largely reconstructed but still stunning. Do not miss the National Palace Museum, which displays a lot of stuff from this an other royal palaces."
5341,4.0,The palace is an interesting place to visit to learn about some of Korea's history. Make sure you arrive for the 'changing of the guard' ceremony.
5342,5.0,buy the multi ticket admission for all the palaces to save money on entry. if you go to one palace head to this one.
5343,4.0,Magnificent and beautiful architecture. You can simply walk around and experience the beauty but no enter is allowed. Sometimes can get very crowded. Bring a nice camera with wide angle lens and dress with colorful costume are always a good idea.
5344,5.0,"First visit was done alone and stupidly i covered the first part of the palace and left before exploring the back part of it. It was sooooo amazing to see the lake and different parts of the palace which really brought me to the history of how the palace people lived in the past. Take some time to sit by the lake and absorb the surroundings. You will really feel as if you were brought back into history. Go to the east side of the palace after you end the museum visit. There is a vintage corner which shows a tiny vintage cafe, photo studio and how the commoner lived in the past. Definitely worth that 3000won ticket price and I'm sure it's better with the english language guide to understand the history of the palace."
5345,3.0,I have been to palaces in Beijing and so this is not really as interesting as to what I anticipated. I would recommend having a tour guide otherwise it will not be meaningful to walk through this. Guard changing ceremony is worth waiting for and definitely one of the key attractions to watch.
5346,5.0,"You should have a good camrea with, great for photo-shooting. Don't miss the gate guards changing shifts every hour, it's great."
5347,4.0,Be sure to take the English guided tour to get the most out of your visit. It's free of charge (inclusive in the access fee) and very insightful.
5348,5.0,"Nice way to spend an afternoon wandering around beautiful parks and little pagodas, etc. Get an information pamphlet (like 500 KRW) so you can add some history knowledge to your gazing. They are available next to where you buy the tickets."
5349,5.0,"This is one of the must sees in Seoul. Easy to reach with public transport (subway station Gyeongbokgung or Anguk from where you can walk through some very nice streets), you can spend half a day walking around the palace grounds. Be aware that most of the buildings aren't original, but are restaurations from 19th and 20th century. The overall setting of this palace within super busy Seoul is amazing."
5350,4.0,"Do not be fool. This palace is amazingly big! I spent an hour and a half and still.didn't manage to cover all the grounds. Still, the lake area is amazingly peaceful. Pretty much own time own target too."
5351,4.0,"The natural beauty at the palace, it's manicured lawns, sprawling campus, the beautiful backdrop of hills were truly impressive. Having seen the magnificent palaces and forts of India, I didn't get awed by the palace buildings. Most of the structures had a similar build, simple but beautiful wooden structures. The palace is very well maintained. The most beautiful building was two storied structure built in the middle of a pond on the western part of the campus.  There is a museum with Korean cultural artifacts, nice to spend some time here. There is also a theme park based show casing a Korean village, nice for kids."
5352,4.0,Love the place and people in traditional costume were professional. The hourly ceremony is interesting so don't miss it!
5353,3.0,"Basically it is a old castle with a big open court yard. There will be a lot of tourists getting off of fleets of buses. Lots of large tour groups, some with matching hats and tshirts.  There's not a lot of shade, it will be wise to bring some water, an umbrella, a hat, and some sunscreen. It is close to a lot of bus and metro stops.  Overall, it is something to visit after eating some ginger chicken and taking a breaking from shopping."
5354,4.0,"Well,maybe because i expected it too much so when i got there i was disapointed. If you wanna go there,it is not far from the station. But i forgot the station's name. It is kinda confusing to reach it,you must really remember the station's names since typical station in Korea are almost same. It costs about 3,000 won."
5355,5.0,"This place is huge, we spent 3 hours with a guided tour and we visited the buildings and grounds that are very important and have a royal history significance but architecture wise words could not explained how intricate and beautiful the place and the history is amazing. It is must if you visit Seoull very accessible by public transportation or do hop on hop off bus and that is one of the stop."
5356,5.0,"I was on a 1 day trip in Seoul, Ms. Guide was very nice and funny, she spoke very good English, so there was no problem to understand everything she said. Probably single trip would be more interesting, than in a group of random ppl, but I didn't have time for organizing everything by myslef. The company picked me-up from the hotel, so I didnt have to worry about anything. Unfortunately I dont remember how was the trip called and via what company. I've ordered it from the hotel. Palace is beautiful, very big, a lot of interesting places with museum, where you can learn something about history. The place is amazing but, like all places in this type, very crowdy, so it's very hard to take a good picture without random ppl."
5357,4.0,"Although the palace is recently restored, it's on a huge site with beautiful parks and lakes between the buildings. The folk museum is also worth a visit"
5358,4.0,Its good to be here and witness the guard changing ceremony.. we are lucky when we went there is a parade and also flea market held opposite of the palace. Great place for photo taking.. I prefer to came here durong winter. As summer is too hot to handle in an open area..
5359,5.0,"After a few hours of sleep, and just a tad hungover, we started our adventure to the historic Gyeongbokgung Palace. This palace was on acres upon acres of land. If you visit at the right time you’ll get to witness the guard ceremony at the front gate. We noticed a lot of visitors doing their usual “peace sign” photo ops at the front of the palace and then leaving the grounds which caused us to wonder whether or not we wanted to spend the 8000 Wons to go in further since no one else was going inside. I am so thankful we opt to pay. Once we were inside everything just seem surreal. It was honestly like going back in time, and the architectural details of the reconstruction of the palace and its surrounding buildings were magnificent. And quite frankly, after a long night of partying this was the perfect way to detox."
5360,4.0,"This is the first stop on the Incheon Airport Seoul City Tour. It is an amazing place but we were only there for about 45 minutes. If we are ever in Seoul for a couple of days, we would likely go back and spend at least a half day there. But if you are at the airport for a long layover, coming here on the 5 hour tour is sorth it"
5361,5.0,"This palace in my personal Seoul palace rating gets well-deserved 2nd place. It doesn't differ much from acrhitecture point of view from other palaces, but nonetheless it's beautiful and impressive. Guard ceremony is interesting. You can check times of ceremony at the gates - there is info sign with schedule and type of ceremony."
5362,5.0,An excellent palace with so much to see... the change of guards ceremony is a must see as it reflects the local Korean culture and is colourful...
5363,5.0,"I ended up going on a day when there weren't any performances going on, but they did have guards that were traditionally dressed at the entrance. It wasn't too crowded, but it was fairly difficult to get a good view of the blue house because a good amount of the tourists congregated at the viewing area. The palace grounds were gorgeous, and getting to go to the Folk Art Museum was also great. The girls I went with and I just kept looking at the museum from afar until we finally worked through the palace grounds and figured out what it was. The mock village that was set up was pretty cool too."
5364,4.0,"Unfortunately wooden structures tend to burn down over the centuries. This is a neat palace, but it's not that ancient. The free walking tour in Seoul (found at the official Visit Seoul web site) was nice, because they guide explained what we would have otherwise missed."
5365,5.0,"if you a Saeguk K-drama fan, u should come here to get the feeling. subway station: gyeongbokgung station, anguk station also can"
5366,5.0,"If you only have time to see one palace in Seoul make it this one. There are free tours everyday: Tours depart in front of the Information Center at Heungnyemun Gate (흥례문). Duration: 1 hr - 1 hr 30 min Tour Schedule: English: 11:00, 13:30, 15:30 Japanese: 10:00, 12:30, 14:30 Chinese: 10:30, 13:00, 15:00  The entrance fee to the palace is 3000won. You can also buy a combination ticket for 10 000won. This will give you entrance to the following four Palaces: Changdeokgung Palace (including Huwon, Secret Garden), Changgyeonggung Palace, Deoksugung Palace, Gyeongbokgung Palace and Jongmyo Shrine.  Please note that Gyeongbukgung is closed on Tuesdays.  The changing of the guard is also worth seeing so make sure you time your visit with that. 3 times per day, 10 a.m., 1 p.m., 3 p.m.  After visiting the palace you can walk to Tosokchon restaurant to have its its signature samgyetang (chicken ginseng soup) made with glutinous rice, gingko nuts, ginseng, garlic and jujube, as well as 30 different types of medicinal herbs and grains. The line at the restaurant might be long but it moves fairly quiclyk and it is a must have when visiting Seoul!"
5367,5.0,Most amazing place for foreigners. Architecture and history combined at one stop. Not to be missed when in Seoul.
5368,5.0,Originally visited in July 2011. Had a 12 hour layover in Seoul and took the opportunity to book a half day tour that brought us primarily to the Gyeongbokgung Palace. We were able to witness the changing of the guard ceremony and explore the grounds for quite some time. The colors of the clothing and architecture were memorably vibrant. Following our palace visit we went to the nearby museum to learn more about Korean culture and history.
5369,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung is the most interesting place in Seoul. You will see Korean traditional architecture in this palace. You can enter the area for free if you wear traditional clothes, Hanbok."
5370,5.0,"Huge palace with loads of history behind it. Good to have a rent a audio guide which is available at the information counter for a small fee of 3000 won.  The palace is repainted every 30 years. Thus, might look a bit too surreal depending on when you visit  Change of guards ceremony can be viewed at specific time. And need not purchase the entrance tickets if you just want to view this cause it happens outside the main entrance."
5371,3.0,"It was pretty nice, but a little dull and hard to find a nice path through to see everything. A lot of the buildings look the same. I found the insides more interesting than the outsides, but, of course, you're not allowed to go inside, you can only look through the window. There were a lot of school kids there on field trips, but I didn't find it annoying. We were used as props in pictures for what we figured was some kind of scavenger hunt, which was amusing. Unfortunately, we came on a day when there was a concert, so we didn't get to see the changing of the guard :("
5372,5.0,"I and my family were so excited to visit to Korea. I got strong impression when I had company trip to Korea several years ago. At that time, I decided to be with my parents. Especially I was comfy with strong security in Korea and Korean were quite kind and warmhearted. Anyway it is very recommendable to visit Korea with your family.... I went to two palaces as my guide's recommendation... actually she preferred 2nd palace named Changdeokgung palace.Gyeongbokgung palace is representative, I was told it is the biggest one... it looks like forbidden city but it was built up around 30 years later than Gyeongbokgung palace. I went to Chankdeokgung palace as well. it is 2nd palace... there are 5palaces in Korea. the second palace was completely different.. it is also recommendable with many interesting history.SEEING IS BELIEVING.My tour guide was very enthusiastic and her story telling was so helpful to understand ,catched our concentration and touched us.. it was one of my strong impressing in Korea until the end day.. My collegue let me know one tour agent in Korea. We stayed for 5days, except for one day, we joined guided tour with her. she was very proud of their company(tour agent).. she was professional. When you travel to Korea, I want you to be with a good tour guide with very forsure agent. The agent name was very unique.. Anneonghaseyo Tour.. haha..It was available to have costomised tour with very reasonable budget...I was told it was handled by family that's why I could trust much more than other contries for trip. If you have any plan to travel to Korea, contact here.. I have business card of that agent.. Everyone will be satisfied with ..."
5373,5.0,"This place is huge! Palace buildings have intricate designs with beautiful surroundings (ponds, trees, etc). The guard changing ceremony is a must-see, an amazing experience indeed. The official English tour provided for free is also very helpful. Highly recommended."
5374,5.0,"I visited the place with one of my Korean business partner and he made a digestive short history of the palace, king and following Japanese occupation. The palace has been restored to a very original condition and there are plenty to learn if you want to understand Korean pride."
5375,5.0,"Tried to explore all area of the palace and strolling under huge ginko tree really made my day. No need to hurry if you want to find hidden gems in here. If you visit with hanbok, you don't need to pay admission fee."
5376,4.0,"The palace is very impressive, especially being in downtown Seoul. The best part was underneath the King Sejong statue in front of the Palace gates. There is a huge museum underneath, with a lot of cool Korean history. There was a good Turtle Ship section with a big 1/3 scale model you could go inside. Overall the palace itself was too packed for me, but the museum under the statue was fun to see."
5377,5.0,"If you were to go to one of the palaces, i recommend this one. We went on the weekend and there were some students who offered to be free tour guides (to practice their english) . Spent about 3 hours on the palace grounds"
5378,5.0,"Never fails to be impressed by the architecture and history of the place. Going there on a Saturday means jostling lots of people.  Easy to get to the place using the subway. And from the palace there are other attractions nearby, notably the ""Stream""."
5379,4.0,"big palace with great architecture... changing guard ceremony, you have to see it........................."
5380,4.0,"this palace is quite huge and has so many colorful buldings. the details are amazing. gyeongbokgung is the largest palace in korea. if you like history and culture, i suggest you to buy integrated ticket for palaces, including jongmyo shrine and secret garden guided tour, only for KRW10.000"
5381,4.0,It is the biggest palace out of the 5 palaces in korea. The admission ticket cost around 3000 won per adult and it is easy to walk around even without tour guide.. there will be royal guards changing ceremony and we can either watch it from in front of the entrance or inside..it's quite interesting and quite a sight..nice..
5382,3.0,I came here because it is among the top of the list for Seoul attractions. For me Seoul itself is just a hype. Maybe due to k-wave. You don't have to enter the castle. Just stay outside to see the performance around 10am.
5383,3.0,It is definatly worth a visit but don't expect too much. Korea is still rebuilding and getting their sites back to their former glory after the Japanese occupation. It was good and it is worth a visit but I would recommend a walk around changdeokgung palace and it's secret garden if you only have time for one
5384,3.0,"If you've been to the forbidden city I would say skip this palace. Being newly built, It feels more like a movie set than a walk through history. Maybe in a hundred years it will gain some character."
5385,5.0,The well-preserved palace is a must-see attraction in Seoul. Be sure to take the time to wander around its extensive grounds.
5386,5.0,"I had been to the palace before during the day and it was very nice, but this time there was a week where it was open at night time (normally closed at night). It was 3,000 won for a ticket, but was well worth it! Only 300 foreigners were allowed to get tickets.  The palace at night was very different and a different experience. If you are lucky and visit during one of the few times it is open at night, GO."
5387,3.0,"Took my son's fiance and her dad when they visited last week. Palace is big and will take at least 2-3 hours to see it all, so plan accordingly. If your visiting in the spring or summer have water with you. There are tours in various languages (English 3 times a day) and they are part of the fee. Plenty to see and more is being added as the restore the palace."
5388,4.0,One must go for it. It is one of the Korean traditional cultural places. It has a garden as well where you will find various colorful flowers and trees. Very nominal entrance fee.  Visited October 2014
5389,5.0,Very well staffed palace and grounds it is worth it to take the tour of both the palace and the secret gardens.
5390,4.0,Go and enjoy the traditional Korean cultural sights in the palace! But prepare for the scorching hot weather. Also some steep steps and all to climb. Worth a visit definitely - especially if you are interested to view some traditional and cultural artefacts!
5391,4.0,"Nice palace, and a big site with extensive gardens and a folk museum (think history of Korea), to visit.  Only cost a couple of quid, definitely worth it."
5392,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace, the most beautiful and largest of all five palaces. free guided tour provide and well explains the culture and building structure."
5393,5.0,I visited the palace in the first week of april 2015..such an amazing traditional korean palace and a must see if you are planning to go to Seoul. You can imagine what stories happend behind those old doors during the royalty days
5394,5.0,For people who are patient and have enough time...This beautiful palace has a hidden gem! If you enter the palace and have the folk museum on your right make sure to go to the left ( west) You will enter the garden grounds and tour pick up point. The garden is beautiful with temples in the lake!
5395,5.0,"I was staying in an apartment right in front of the Palace.  This royal palace is imposing by its size and its majesty. There are tour guides to take you around the palace.  Everyday, at every hour between 10 am and 3 pm, soldiers in costumes of the time when the palace was created (1395) march in musique for the change of guards. It is fun to watch."
5396,5.0,We visited the palace whilst attending a family wedding. We had recently seen a program on TV documenting the rebuilding of the palace and to see it in reality was just awesome. At the time of our visit it was during Korea's Labour Day celebrations with various displays taking place. A spectacular none of us will ever forget.
5397,3.0,"It's a beautiful palace, huge and peaceful compound. If you really want to reap the benefit of the histories behind, grab the free tour guide available near the ticket counter. Walk around, take your time. Visit the place in the morning or later in the evening since it's more comfortable. We went there near noon approaching end of spring, so yeah, the sun was not exactly nice to us :D."
5398,5.0,"Nice place and very large place, very good for exercise ..There are free guides for foreigner and Korean...Clean and tidy"
5399,5.0,This is a huge place including a Presidential Museum which is worth seeing. Beautiful grounds and buildings. A good few hours are required to see it all and it's well worth it
5400,3.0,Nothing much to see. The guards are unusually dressed in red and blue and are worth a look. The palace is a series of bulidings in a large walled compound with gardens and plenty of gravel.
5401,5.0,The palace complex is huge with many beautiful buildings. The grounds are usually quiet which is a rare delight for a location in the middle of Seoul. The history about the palace is well explained and very interesting also.
5402,5.0,You should visit during guard change hour. It's quite nice to see the tradition ceremony. The palace is quite big and worth seeing
5403,5.0,The palace is located at central Seoul and offers english speaking guide. its easy to go there (metro and taxi).
5404,3.0,"interesting and indeed a must-visit place but at the same time there's nothing too much to see. the palace complex is huge and beautiful, though."
5405,4.0,"This palace is amazing. It's absolutely humongous, with a large park around. The buildings are beautiful, and provide a nice insight in past Korean building style. Also, the clash between the palace, The mountains and the 21st century city is entertaining. We went on a Sunday and stumbled upon a Taekwondo demonstration at the Folk museum, great fun!"
5406,4.0,"Having seen a number of Palaces this was by far the best as we were in time for the changing of the Guard ceremony. It is extremely colourful, loud and bewildering but a great experience."
5407,3.0,"This place is quite large, clean and well managed. Old buildings reflected the royal life of the Korean leader long time ago."
5408,5.0,"Great history and architecture.Don't miss costume parade. Also see the Folk Museum nearby. Facility accepts credit card, but the entrance fee is very nominal."
5409,5.0,"This palace is somewhat like a ""mini-Forbidden City,"" and is definitely a must-see. If you do not view the Changing of the Guard ceremony - about an hour, it is most difficult to convince your friends that you have actually been to Seoul."
5410,4.0,"Beautiful palace of the empower. Very extensive compound of old buildings and relics. I wish we'd had a tour guide to tell us more about the place, but it was still pleasant. Very in expensive to visit. Be sure to go all the way to the back where it is more green and there are beautiful koi ponds."
5411,5.0,"I thought I was just going to spend a few minutes looking around this place. Well, I didn't realize how large it was until I spend hours trying to just explore it. The place had several buildings (not just the main palace) and it had really nice gardens and bodies of water. Then it was quite a surprise to see a really awesome view of the mountains at the back of the palace. What's just as amazing is how accessible it was. All that you needed to do to get there is to get on to their really convenient train system and hop off at the station right next to the entrance of the palace. Really a must see. If I had to visit only one place in Seoul, this would be it."
5412,5.0,Great place....and bring along your handycam... record the changing palace. It did have certain time... and the place is so nice. Especially during spring.
5413,5.0,Palace is huge and gives you good idea how kings lived in Korea back in the days. Great historical experience. Guards change is highly recommended - happens only couple of times a day so make sure to visit at the right time.
5414,5.0,"If you choose just one palace to visit in Seoul, choose this. It's beautiful and in a huge area so be prepared to walk a lot. There is also a beautiful lake with a little island and temple."
5415,5.0,"On our first day in Seoul, my spouse and I visited this Palace which we came to know as one of the five largest palaces in Korea and was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty. The palace was aptly named Gyeongbokgung Palace - ""the Palace Greatly Blessed by Heaven"". This palace has a remarkable history as it was destroyed by fire during the Japanese invasion and it took years to rebuilt and restore this palace. We feel blessed too to be able to see this majestic and beautiful palace. We toured the numerous rooms such as the Throne room, Pavillions, the Pond, part of the Queen's residence where the garden of the four chimneys of Amisan are located. The distant Mount Bugaksan and Mount Namsan can also be seen from the Palace grounds."
5416,5.0,"This is where you can feel the richness of Korean History. The palace is beautiful, ancient and well preserve. You can take a lot of good pictures in this palace, there are many hidden details to catch, like the window locks and wood frames. It was Thursday, 11:30 am when we visited and almost every ground in the palace is already crowded with tourist and kids on excursion. We got lucky to see the changing of the guards in the main gate. It is very interesting ceremony. This is a must see!"
5417,5.0,it was my first impression when I first saw the palace. It is really hige and grand where it needs a huge effort to maintain its condition!
5418,5.0,The changing of guards ceremony is like a scene in a Korean darama series. The experience will bring you back to the past. The architecture of the structures and the huge area will give the tourists a good view of the history and stories from the early dynasty and the King's life.
5419,4.0,"Spacious, beautiful, worthwhile seeing. Minimal cost as it be seen with 4other palaces for 10,000 won. Great value. Take time to see the museum as well."
5420,5.0,"My family and I were very lucky to be able to see the Changing of the Guards. It was huge and beautiful! I am so amazed by how they were able to preserve the palaces with minimal modernization (well, minimal from what the eye can see). Should you visit, make sure you're at the palace by 1pm or 3pm. They have the Changing of the Guards and it's such a sight to see."
5421,4.0,There is the guard change 2 a day. The museum provided good English guides and labels. There is a museum shop at basement - good prices equal to common shops but better selection.
5422,5.0,we went to see this place with my daughter and worth the trip. we are there early morning not much people so we have a good view of the place
5423,5.0,Highly recommend it.. Best time to go early AM because much less tourists around. Very good place to see and experience Korean history
5424,5.0,"This palace is huge! There's a lot of nice grounds around the area. It was more fun to take the English tour in order to find out a little about some of the buildings, etc. It was a free tour, just check for the times. There are a couple of museums in the area that you can go to also, which were well done, but not the most interesting museums, to me. Also the blue house is outside the gate and there's cool areas of Seoul all around the palace."
5425,5.0,You get to walk around freely around this well preserved historical palace. Wonderful and mesmerizing.
5426,5.0,"I thought this was going to be a 15 minute activity, max 30 minutes. See the palace, take a pic and get out. So mistaken! The grounds of this place were huge! Go on a clear day and you get views of the mountain in the background. There's a free folk museum too which is rather interesting (coming from someone who doesn't really like museums...). Get away from the main temple because that's where the tour groups gather."
5427,5.0,"The complex was great to see and explore. Most things have an english translation, so it is very US tourist friendly. I did the audio tour and there was a good bit of history, but not as much information about how the buildings were used as I would have liked."
5428,3.0,"This is a very large palace. It is often the most commonly cited palace but make sure that its not the only one you see if you are time-constrained. The Changdeokgung (UNESCO site) is a more balanced better choice. If you intend to see at least these two, save some money by getting the all palace pass."
5429,3.0,"Attracts many so plan early if you want good photo ops, else enjoy the people. My second visit here and it was only average. I believe I would enjoy it more if I had a historical guided tour."
5430,4.0,"Although a small amount of buildings are original, most of the buildings on the palace are actually rebuilt after they were destroyed throughout history (fires, japan invasion, war ...). They still accurately show the way of life and style of the times of the emperors.  I advice you to take a guide, otherwise you'll be a bit lost like we were, looking at gorgeous buildings but without knowing exactly what they'r history is."
5431,4.0,"The place very accessible by metro and very interesting guard changing ceremony (traditional costumes) that performed hourly. Free guided tour in different languages are available, just look out for the time slot. The tour about an hr and the guide was knowledgable. The last stop was at the pavilion which is the shooting scene for Kdrama (Moon embracing the sun). The musuem is free entry with good details of Korea history and culture."
5432,4.0,"Lots of people from different countries. The place full of history, very beautiful, very colorful, must see! Children will certainly like it."
5433,4.0,"There are free tour guides on selective hours for selective languages to explain on the building, cultural and also history of Korea. You can feel the atmosphere of being in a palace during the ancient time. It is definitely worth a visit to know more on Korea history and also the beautiful scenery is really great."
5434,4.0,We were there at the time of a changing of the guard ceremony and it was very interesting. Definitely a must see part of Seoul.
5435,5.0,Stopped by the museum and learned a lot about Korean history and culture. The grounds and very nicely landscaped and the buildings very grand. This is one of the best places for photo opportunities.
5436,5.0,You can't possible visit Seoul without making a stop here. The guided tours are free and interesting. And the photo opportunities are endless. Make sure you walk towards the back which includes a pavilion situated in the middle of a lake and accessed by a stone bridge.
5437,5.0,"On the Seoul tourist board site, you can reserve a free guided tour (in english) of Gyeongbokgung Palace. We met our tour guide in front of the ticket booth and were fortunate to see the changing of the guards at the palace (check times and dates). Through our helpful guide, we learned about the Japanese administration building that was built during the japanese colonial rule symbolically at the main gate of the palace. It was only destroyed and the magnificent gate replaced in the 1980s. As you walk through the imposing buildings which are elaborately painted, we learned the paint was imported from China and at times cost more than the buildings. Don't miss the interesting sun-dial in front of one of the king's main rooms. Nearby Gyeonbokgung Palace is the traditional korean neighborhood (Hanok Bukchon village) with nice small shops, art galleries and restaurants."
5438,4.0,"Went there during winter and it's quite good for taking pictures. But other than that, there's nothing much you can do there"
5439,5.0,All of the palaces in Seoul are amazing. We were fortunate enough to enjoy our visit this time during cherry blossom time. The history is very interesting and the place very peaceful and relaxing to just stroll and spend time.
5440,5.0,"Unique and gives an insight to Korea's history and its architecture. Has a nice museum that contains a lot of interesting information about their culture and their past as well. Wait for the changing of guards at the entrance, grab a brochure while waiting, it will tell you what the guards' attire represent."
5441,4.0,"The area of the palace is pretty big and very nice to walk in. My ""minus"" is, that the temple as an attraction itself is not really old, but newly built. In my opinion, there are more beautiful, authentic temples in Asia... Awesome during cherry blossom season (which lasts only for about two weeks ;))"
5442,4.0,"It is a huge palace but basically looks the same after awhile. Interesting to see the guard change ceremony. Probably the only one that worth seeing, the rest would pretty much be smaller scale than this one."
5443,5.0,The palace was so beautiful. There were several lovely buildings including one on the water. The roofs and beautiful decorations under the roofs were incredible. The grounds were quite peaceful and I could understand why there were so many visitors.  We were lucky to be there on the weekend when they have guard marching ceremony. Quite colorful and enjoyable.
5444,5.0,"I went there with a guided tour for a hole day that included this magnificent Palace. Located north of downtown dn near the Cheokbokung Palace. There are so many different beautiful buildings in this áreas de the different trees in Bloom, ( before entering They Tokyo us to de National Folk Miseum which is very nice!), you really need a lot of time to see everything, but we were so walking so fast. At the end is the principal ""keep"" with the little lake around it that made an idillic pictures! Wonderful! Entrance is 3000 son (2400 for groups of ten or more persons); children 7-17 pay 1500 ( or 1200 for more than 10) under 6 and over 65 are free. Closed on Tuesdays and always open At 9:00 a.m. . Closes between 4-5:30 dependiente on the month. This is a MUST visit while en Seoul!"
5445,4.0,"If you just want to have a sticky beak without paying for a ticket (though they are VERY cheap - 3000 or 4000 won I think), you can go inside the first gates and walk around the courtyard area.  It's quite a lot of walking, and bit rough for the pram/stroller, but doable none the less."
5446,4.0,Such a beautiful place of you love history. There's also a resting place where you can drink coffee.  Changing of guards also happens during weekdays.  My fave place is the Museum.
5447,4.0,"We had a luck to see guard change with all their ancient picturesque costumes,we joined to free English guided tour , there are few such tours each day ,it take about 1.5 hour,and we spent another 1 hour there to make pictures. Thicket cost 3000 won seniors elder 65 years free."
5448,5.0,"We toured Gyeongbokgung Palace with a guide Who was certain to get us there in time for the colorful changing of the guard! Despite a chilly gray day, we enjoyed the ceremony along with a huge crowd. After wander through of all the buildings/grounds, we also stopped into the Korean folk history museum that lies just beyond the palace grounds. Good way to spend a few hours of your tour-time in Seoul."
5449,5.0,"During weekend, there are guard changing ceremony. Very cultural sight. We rented audio guide. Great value and we learned a lot (even our 7/8 years old kids)"
5450,5.0,"I ended up spending 5 hours here. It was great. They have the changing of the guard several times a day which is quite dramatic. I took a free English speaking tour at 11, but they have them at various times. Then I went to the Folk Museum at the end of the palace complex, and the National Palace Museum at the front of the complex. Great way to spend the day for only $3. Highly recommend."
5451,5.0,"I traveled here as part of the Free Seoul City Tour available from the Incheon International Airport tourism department. Our group of 20 was guided by a very well versed and knowledgeable guide. The grounds are absolutely beautiful and very well maintained, as is the palace itself. The backdrop of mountains and cherry blossoms certainly add to the mesmerizing experience here."
5452,5.0,"The palace was quite huge. However, I didn't feel tired of walking as the surrounding was very captivating. Enjoyed watching the change of soldiers and also the architecture of the entire building. Totally a must-not-miss place of visit"
5453,5.0,Well maintained and proudly displayed - this palace and its' surroundings are a must do while in Seoul. You can have a sense of the history and pride of the Korean people. You can spend a lovely afternoon on a 'date' or with your entire family. Was only 3000 KRW (3 bucks). Highly recommended
5454,5.0,"Discover the very first palace in Seoul, explore the different parts of the palace and don't forget to have your photo taken with the door guards."
5455,4.0,"It is not glittery, rather simple for a king. Yet it was an enjoyable place. Sit around the lake and enjoy the view and cool air especially in spring."
5456,4.0,"The visit of the Gyeongbokgung Palace is definitely nice with guided Chinese Tour (as my mum is visiting). The guide is FOC as per ticketing but you need to follow the timing if you are visiting. There are four languages namely Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese. The areas inside those palace are forbidden to entry as more Chinese Tourists are visiting such places, they like to touch the historical structure which will damaged them. As the structures are slowly built due to fire and war damages. Overall, the guided tour is good. After the tour, you may exit the back door and you will see the Modern Korea Prime Minister Office and Ministerial Offices. You can go back in to the Palace with the tickets. Right at another corner is the Museum of the old Korea where you see items from the different Dynasties to the old villages of Korea."
5457,5.0,"Do not forget to catch the changing of the guards. We caught the 4pm one at the main gate, and it was such a colorful treat! There weren't a lot of people when we went there, so we were able to go around and enjoy the serenity of the place, especially the part beside the pond/lake.  Read more about it in my blog: https://jeffer.wordpress.com/2014/03/23/south-korea-pt-2-a-dose-of-royalty/"
5458,4.0,the large compound of mostly reconstructed buildings is worth a visit and the small admission fee. guided tours in English help visitors understand the historical significance. it's a great spot to take pretty photos of the typical Korean architecture.
5459,4.0,"Nice place to visit as you can see the old architecture design of Korean palace. From there, you can learn more about their King & Queen buildings. Interesting to see how ancient korean guards warm themselves and how the smokes are channeled to another buildings. Amazing too to see how they maintain their buildings (nets are around the roofs, or sharp small sticks around) to prevent birds droppings on the wooden roof)."
5460,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung is more for sight-seeing as the rooms around the palace are mostly enclosed. The sceneries surrounding the palace is scenic especially when I visited during winter. Don't miss out on the changing of guards ceremony which is the main focal attention of Gyeongbokgung. There is also a booth for you to try on hanboks.  For those of you who are expecting a museum-like setting with artifacts and exhibits, this palace is not really like that. For that, you may want to visit Unhyeongung, located quite nearby to Gyeongbokgung. Unhyeongung's rooms are more open-concept with artifacts and multilingual (Korean, English, Mandarin & Japanese) descriptions of every exhibit."
5461,4.0,"Since this is the biggest palace in Seoul, of course you should see it. Lots to see and photograph, even though it is much reconstructed."
5462,5.0,A vast piece of awesome architecture coupled with unique and authentic South Korean Heritage. Love seeing the Palace up close. Reminds me of the Forbidden City in China. One of the best tourists spots in Korea!
5463,5.0,"Whether you have 36 hours or a more extended stay in Seoul, you should definitely stop by Gyeongbokgung (gung = palace). There are several palaces in Seoul but this one has the largest compound. If you don't much about Korean history, I would recommend the guided tour (which I think is free) and is offered in several languages and throughout the day. It's interesting hearing about the function of the different buildings and getting a sense of Koreas's imperial history. Definitely must see/do."
5464,5.0,"Beautiful, impressive and interesting. Be sure to catch the change of guard. This season is great since most of the trees were in blossom."
5465,4.0,"The palace is of course a must see. It is an awesome sight that shows a lot of the history of Seoul and Korea, However, it doesn't ""breath"" this history as you would hope. Large parts of the original buildings have been destroyed in the past and are now rebuild. So it feels more like a life size museum or rebuild than like an ancient place. If you set your mind to this, you will still be able to see the beauty of the place."
5466,5.0,"It was absolutely lovely, entrance fee is only 3,000 won and it is nice to spend half the day there slowly exploring the beautiful architecture!"
5467,4.0,"This palace is pretty crowded, but for a reason. The architecture is stunning and the detail in construction is remarkable. It is big and will easily take up a lot of your time if you wish it to. If you come to Seoul, you have to see Gyeongbokgung."
5468,4.0,"When visiting this palace, you should join the tour as this will help you understand the story behind the palace and the Royals. Schedule your trip before hand so that you can try the free Hanbok wearing, watch the changing of the royal guards, and tour of the Palace on half day. Visit the palace in the morning as there are more people in the afternoon."
5469,5.0,"The site is huge, and there are so many aspects of the property that the best thing is to join a free tour so that you can learn as much as possible about life in the palace. Certainly worthy of a visit. Plan at least 2 hours."
5470,4.0,"Enjoyed a half day visit to this palace. Entrance cost was cheap, but would get more from the visit with a good guide - I recommend one for best experience. Changing of the guard is quite nice and very colorful attire."
5471,5.0,There were guided tours in English! The place was huge so even after the tour there were more places to explore. the tours have set time so you can explore and come back to join the tour.
5472,4.0,Its a must to visit. This place is full of culture and history. Best to go with a guide so that they are able to explain every details
5473,4.0,"clearly one of the things not to be missed in SEOUL, if you are into monuments. I have lived 5 years next to the palace to know it quite well under many different seasons, Winter can be quite nice with SUN and SNOW. Expect people but the palace is big, however not as big as the FORBIDDEN City in BEIJING. There is a FOLKS museum inside that is worth visiting (you need 1.5 h) and you can have a lunch there, quite nice to take a break from the busy city. Dont expect to see much furniture into the buildings, Korean Palaces are always very barren...the whole thing makes an enjoyable experience for a half day."
5474,5.0,"What an amazing experience to see up close many of reconstructed and existing palatial buildings. I was also impressed at my tour guides knowledge of history. I just wish that the Japanese army had not detroyed, desecrated and simply made such a mark on these grounds. The grassy patches near the Queen Dowager's residence really made me feel sad. You must visit these palaces while in Seoul!"
5475,4.0,"The palace consists of many, many buildings. Design, painting and architecture of those buildings are almost the same. The main gate and the place hall are the most beautiful ones."
5476,5.0,"Seoul and Korea itself has many palaces scattered all around. Gyeongbokgung Palace is unique as it now has a change of guards routine and also reenactment of guards training all about its compound.  You pay a fee to enter the palace compound and you can have a guided tour in various language. If you are not a museum/palace sort of person, just enjoy the attractions outside the paid palace compound."
5477,4.0,Enjoyed walking the grounds and seeing the beautiful painted buildings. Some have furnishings you can glimpse from the doorway. If you are 65 or older it is free to enter. There were many tour buses when we arrived but it was not over crowded. You can also watch the colorful changing of the guards. Enjoy!
5478,5.0,"Very big temple area, try to get there when the guards change. This area is very big and you can easily spent 2-3hours here. Remember to bring good walking shoes and not clip claps. You can buy a guided tour, or just go there yourself, easy to find. If you have the time go visit the folks museum next door."
5479,4.0,Take a walking tour to get the most information about these many buildings and how people lived here. Catch the changing of the guards.
5480,2.0,"Not much info onsite, so I focused on architectural details instead. In this part of the world, there are truly grand examples of this style."
5481,4.0,"this is 1 of the 2 palaces you can visit in Seoul, it's probably the main one people visit, it's truly magical and picture perfect. it gives you a great sense of how the royalties lived and there's so much history in this place, even though a lot of the buildings were not the original as some of them have been destroyed by fire, but they did a great job of reconstruct them to their initial appearance. I enjoyed it a lot and spent about 2-3 hours there :)"
5482,5.0,"We were amazed at how beautifully presented all the buildings were. They were lacking in information though, even the tour guide didn't tell us much. Great place. Must see. Do some research before so you know more about it."
5483,5.0,"I really reminds me of the Drama RoofTop Prince, and that's the reason we're here too.  #MickyYooChun #MyInspiration"
5484,5.0,"This is, if not the most beautiful and biggest among the 5 grand palaces in Seoul. Go early as it does get busy around mid-afternoon. You can spend a few hours in here getting lost in the beautiful traditional architecture and the atmosphere. That and you are standing where in the past royalty have been."
5485,4.0,Surrounded by the modern city buildings the Temple is a haven of tradition. Close to the Metro it is easy to get too. The Temple is a traditional Asian style of open spaces and exotically roofed buildings. I do always feel that more could be made of the internals of the buildings. With traditional furniture and features. Well worth a visit when you are in Seoul.
5486,4.0,Gyeongbok Palace is a must see if in the Seoul area. It's still in process of being restored but well worth the trip. Not overly exciting but nice. If you time it right you can get the tour in English or Japanese.
5487,5.0,"must visit attraction when you are planning to go on holiday to visit Seoul, you must visit it twice in the morning and at night when they open the light, also during the day you have to watch the ceremony for changing the palace guards"
5488,3.0,"Went to Gyeongbokgung as our first destination during our Korea Trip. It was winter, and was really cold. We saw the changing of guards session. The place is quite huge and it wasn't crowded during the winter"
5489,5.0,"It's a beautiful antique castle. They have people dress up and shows of how they use to dress, and march for war. Definitely a place to visit in Seoul."
5490,3.0,"It's a large beautiful palace with a mountain as it's backdrop (sorry, I don't remember the name of the mountain). We were lucky there was no entrance fee when we went there!"
5491,4.0,"We were there when it was the peak of autumn, and the beautiful palace garden was filled with bright colours. As many other reviewers would point out, it would be good to come in time for the guard-changing ceremony, where you get to see the different units marching around in the main square. You can plan in advance with the ceremony timings here: http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_2_1.jsp?cid=292853.  The grounds are clean and well-maintained, although I wouldn't wax lyrical about the sights (other than the garden yes). I might have unfairly compared this to Beijing's Forbidden Palace, but if you have been to Beijing, you might get what I mean. Nothing that much to see when you really look into each of the halls or rooms here.  It's a short walk to Samcheongdong (use the eastern exit, and work north for 7-10mins), so you could always plan to have lunch or teatime at one of the cafes or restaurants there."
5492,5.0,"You really haven't seen a ""Changing of the Guard"" until you've been to the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Strolling around the grounds gives one a lot of photo ops...but the Guards themselves were the highlight for me!"
5493,5.0,"You've seen one palace, you've seen them all. There are sooo many dam palaces in Korea that I felt I had to go to as many as I could. I'd have to say this is my favorite but they all look the same with little differences... This one is special because they have people in costumes at the front and around the palace. I went during winter so I don't know if the other palaces just didn't have people in costumes because of the weather or because I was there so early or if they just didn't have them. But it was great seeing the customes and wondering how they were keeping warm in the freezing weather."
5494,4.0,"We got to try on the Korean traditional outfits for free. It was up for grab. We, four of us, put on the outfits, which I forgot the name, and took a photo. The photo seems like we were a fuzzy family, but, all of us were just close friends."
5495,4.0,There are several palaces in south korea. I personally prefer this one. I didn't buy the package that includes tours to several palaces. Best time to go is during the change of guards where you can snap photos of the guards in traditional uniforms.
5496,4.0,"Beautiful Place. It was winter so there wasn't much greenery but it is still very nice. Also got to see the 'Changing of the Guards"" ceremony. Very informative. Can't wait to go back in the summer."
5497,4.0,The palace and grounds were rebuilt after Japanese occupation ended in 1945. For me this dropped it to a 4. A bonus is the grounds are next to the seat of government and a small museum that is a quick history of 1945 forward.
5498,5.0,"Very good spot to visit in Seoul. It is very interesting place, changing the guide is a great ceremony, don't miss it!"
5499,5.0,Entrance fee is not expensive. You can look around limited places in the palace but it's big and there are many places to see. There are some performances in particular time so check it out before you go this place.
5500,5.0,"Went when the palace was lit up for one night. It was beautiful. Definitely worth taking someone there on a date, or for pictures."
5501,3.0,"The Palace is spectacular, huge and majestic. Its a good place to learn about the History of Korea. It is also considered as a well maintain historical tourist spot. However, if you are not into historical or culture then it is okay to give it a pass."
5502,5.0,"Amazing place for some photography skills practices, its vary huge place you might need double battery pack ;)"
5503,5.0,Join the free guided tours for a more thorough appreciation of the beauty and the magic of this place. It's not just a pretty photogenic palace. It's a well preserved place steeped in Korean culture :)
5504,5.0,You can't stop in Seoul and not make a trip here. We came during a changing of the guards ceremony. The colors and action were amazing.
5505,5.0,"It's a ""Must Visit"" palace if you come to visit Seoul. Very nice and big. Before going inside the palace, you should visit ""National Palace Museum"" in the front first."
5506,4.0,A big Korean art traditional architecture style; Located in many station exit but i chose exit5 from Gwanghwamun station; As i came early opening 9am time; So wandered around at Cheonggyecheon canal area before heading these place.  The palace itself very big space area; with many complex building inside; the Korean colorful rooftop style is so delicacy and charming; combined with Korean National Folk village museum; where admidssion fee already plus these 2 places visit with costing 3000 KRW from the palace entrance.
5507,4.0,"I've been in the palace last 2012 but then I decided to go again as I'm with my friends who are first timers. We went there at a wrong time as it was closed but instead, we stroll around the outer grounds of the palace. It was my first time in that area but I love there! We play under the big tree! It's winter but you can still see orange trees/ leaves around the area!  We came back here the next day. We arrived just in time for the ceremony. It was so colorful and by watching this, you will be amazed of their traditions and culture.We availed the English tour and it lasted for an hour. Very helpful indeed to understand its history and the place itself. How I wish I can turn back time!  In 2012, we went there in Autumn so it was full of color but this time since it was winter, the trees were already bald. But nevertheless, the beauty of the palace is still there.  Big palace, Rich history, Beautiful scenery.. perfect! :D"
5508,3.0,"The palace grounds are huge, but after a while, all the buildings start looking the same. This is not like European palace with lavish decorations. Korean palaces seemed to have been very austere in the same-same sort of way. Or so it seemed after visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace. Plus, most of it has been rebuild not long ago, so it doesn't exactly look ancient."
5509,5.0,This place offers the window of the rich culture of this magnificent country or should I say city. Well preserved historical palaces and noticeably clean environment makes this place a must to visit. The place is located inside the city itself so there will be no problem in getting to this place. There's a large parking space for tourist bus and private cars
5510,5.0,"Visiting Gyeongbukgung Palace is a great way to start off a trip to Seoul. Conveniently located near a train stop or bus stop, you can step through one of the gates from the modern world into the past. With the admission fee being very reasonable (₩3,000) for an adult, you can explore on your own or take advantage of a free guided tour. I recommend taking the tour which lasted about about hour to get more of the history of the palace then take another hour or two to explore and watch the activities of the Palace guards. Additionally, if you want to make a day of it, the National Folk Museum and Palace Museum are next to the Palace and a free attractions to round out your visit."
5511,4.0,Nice Palace right in the middle of Seoul. Looks and feels just like a scaled down forbidden city. Take a tour it will help to understand the place better.
5512,3.0,"I was determined to go to Gyeongbokgung palace (it is closed on Tuesdays). It was a perfect centerpiece for Seoul. I was looking forward to the changing of guards ceremony but was cancelled due to the frosty grounds (it snowed two nights ago). I was a bit disappointed but managed to see the palace complex. I was very careful not to tread on the slippery grounds (partly also I had sneakers that don't grip well with ice). I suggest not going to the palaces at winter time as activities are cancelled. Facing the palace was the modern Seoul. It was a perfect mix of the ancient and the modern Korea which has shaped the country. I ventured the palace by myself and they offer free tour guides on fixed times (usually in the afternoon). The information center which is on the gate going to the main palace was very helpful and I was thankful that. (The information center has staff that speak Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and English)."
5513,5.0,Other than the palace itself I think the other attraction is the changing guard ceremony. I just coudlnt get enough of it.
5514,4.0,"It was a very huge place and beautiful too. We were lucky to arrive a few minutes before the Changing of the Guard Ceremony. Unfortunately, due to time constraint, we were not able to explore the place. Make sure to spend at least 2 hours exploring the palace grounds and visiting the National Folk Museum."
5515,4.0,"A historical place to visit while in Seoul. It is commonly packed with tourists, the area with all nice painted buildings. We strolled around the place roughly for an hour where we had many snap shots of the palace, of the trees and of the pond. Walking around the place might be exhausting but compensating with worthwhile experience. We were fortunate to witness the guard changing ceremony and their parade with all their traditional and colorful costumes and had some photo shots with the guards later. It was a wonderful cultural experience to be at Gyeongbokgung Palace."
5516,3.0,This palace doesn't have the grandeur of palaces like the Forbidden City or the intricacies of temples like Angkor Wat. It is very cheap to visit it. But it's only worth visiting if you have nothing better to do.  The temples here aren't as interesting as the ones in Japan or China.
5517,3.0,"The place to be if you are a tourist and looking for a palace to view. Nicely painted buildings, details, and such. Packed with people. Lots of people. This was the only place that I encountered in Korea where the staff were actually not as polite as usual - don't know why. Must be all the foreigners.  The tops of all the buildings were wrapped in wire mesh to keep the pigeons off, and the grounds have a drainage issue with lots of water on the walkways making in wet and slippery (ice !).  Picturesque from a distance - try the ""other"" palace just 500 meters up the road if you are looking for pictures - Deoksugung Palace - it has a nicer feel to it and is a lot less busy."
5518,5.0,My first snow experience is here. Fascinated to see all the snow beside the palace. Amazing view. It makes me love Korea more.
5519,5.0,near the center of seoul. very accesible when you are inside you will feel like you are back to the old korea with the changing of guards and parade
5520,5.0,"I fancy history and this palace made me fantasize of living during the Joseon Dynasty. I am a fan of the korean TV series ""jewel in the palace"" and this place was the actual scene location of the said series. unfortunately, the royal kitchen is under restoration during my visit few days ago and this fix is expected to be done by 2016. i suggest if you visit during autumn or spring. it was winter during my visit here and most of the trees and grass are dried/brown. Though the buildings are so colorful, and the changing of guards ceremony is entertaining.  I suggest that you include Bukchon Hanok Village and Changdeokgung Palace tour on the day for this trip since these attraction sites are just located near to each other, esp. if you enjoy walking :)  For tour guide map, visit: http://www.royalpalace.go.kr/html/eng/guide/guide02.jsp?dep1=1&dep2=2  For info about this attraction: http://www.royalpalace.go.kr/html/eng/main/main.jsp  How to get here? - take the subway and alight at ""gyeongbokgung stn"" (line 3, orange line) - If you want to include a visit in gwanghwamun square, alight at ""gwanhwamun stn"" (line 5, purple line), enjoy the park while walking towards the palace. - or you may avail of the bus tour packages.  For more info, visit: http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=264337  Changing of guards ceremony: 10 a.m. - 3 p.m. (3 times per day, 10 a.m., 1 p.m., 3 p.m.); 11 a.m, 2 p.m., 4 p.m. : only the guard exiting ceremony (for more info, visit: http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0003001006003&p=en&art_id=52624&lang=en)"
5521,5.0,This place is one of the largest and well known places in Korea. It is interesting to see all the different building and I also saw the changing of the guard. This ceremony is a must see when you go to the palace. I believe it happens around 10 am. You can easily access the Palace off the Seoul subway.
5522,5.0,Even though most of the place has been rebuilt- it is still a wonderful cultural experience. Try to come before 3pm and at specific times in the courtyard where you buy tickets you can try on the traditional guard costumes. It is a lot of fun. Plus they have tours in a variety of different languages so make sure to come early if you would like to go on one.
5523,4.0,"The ceremony starts at 1100 , 1400 , 1530 hrs. After the ceremony, you can take pictures with the guards. There is admission fees into the palace. hence we did not purchase the ticket. We just watched the ceremony which takes about 20 min."
5524,5.0,"A beautiful history to listen to. Better take pictures first. Then I recommend to attend the guided tours which are available in different languages at a scheduled time. A ground exhibition is also performed by the palace guards. And after that, visitors can take pictures wearing the guard uniforms. By the way, the entrance fee is only charged when you go into the palace. But for the grounds outside it (but still part of the whole compound) where the exhibition takes place, it is free for all."
5525,5.0,Make sure you get there by 11am and get a good spot to take pictures of the change of guards. It is a beautiful palace and it looked amazing in winter. The lakes were frozen and the sky was blue....gorgeous!
5526,5.0,"A large open plan area with a number of interesting buildings that give you the feeling of the architecture. Watch the colourful changing of the guard ceremony and then take in the museum. Here you will get an insight into the social history of the country. Finally, if the folk dancers and drummers are on, this is a must see session in the auditorium. It's really an excellent show. Be prepared to spend a half day there. You won't regret it."
5527,4.0,"Palace very well upkeep and when compared to China palacce,this is far from it..disvovered that most items are written in Han languages. .so perhaps back then korea had copy from China . winter is ice every where n lakes are frozen..palacces are fantasy n n ever get sick if visiting palacce."
5528,4.0,"Huge area.. plan on spending at least 2 hours here, if you plan to cover the National Palace Museum and the Folk Museum. Don't miss the changing of guards ceremony."
5529,4.0,I suspect even nicer in less cold seasons! We got lucky and saw the guards marching outside the palace entrance. Inexpensive to visit quite a bit to see.
5530,4.0,"I have been to this Palace twice now, and have still not seen every bit of it. There are many really nice things up towards the front that give you a really nice view of the history of their old kings. But, after that, these palace grounds are large and spread out, so lots to see. Very reasonable price, I think around US $7. It is really well maintaned, and I recommend an optional guided tour, no additional cost, and available in English. The changing of the guard outside the grounds is pretty interesting as well, you can do that without entering the palace."
5531,5.0,"This is an amazing cultural treasure, and definitely requires a couple of hours of time investment to properly do it justice. Make sure you pay for the entrance to go in (it's ridiculously cheap--maybe $5?) and try to watch the changing of the guard. The colors of the costumes, along with the music is truly a magnificent experience."
5532,5.0,"5 visits to Seoul, I came here thrice! I specially visit the place again as my previous trip I came in early autumn and mid autumn. Very much wanted a view of the palace in winter! It's lovely, the only thing is it will be more beautiful if it snowed. Simply loved this attraction so much! A great way to spend a morning in Seoul... I'll be back here again in the other seasons."
5533,4.0,"This place is huge, it’s impossible and pretty unfair to just squeeze an hour trip to this place. There are just so many things that left my curious soul wonders, how it was like hundreds years ago when the palace was first built, with its interesting and magnificent architecture – each with its functions and purposes. The palace then went through tests of time from various wars and attacks and some of what remains had been re-built and preserved impressively.  The buildings after a while would felt the same and boring. So we escaped to the garden with wonderful colours of autumn, and landscape of the Bugak mountain on the background. The view was so beautiful, making a popular spot for wedding photoshoots and photography outings. I’ve been to the palace twice – each to different sides of the compound. During both times it felt like going back through time, and getting lost in the history of Korea."
5534,4.0,"I visited this palace in the fall and was able to check out some really nice Korean history. The structures are amazing and well kept. And there was even a musical performance with traditional dancing. Located close to Insadong and other museums, it's a must visit for a traveler in South Korea."
5535,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is an awesome palace. In terms of scale, it is smaller than the Forbidden City in Beijing but equals it in splendour. One can't help but feel the rich history behind it and the traditions and ceremonies that it once held. Although it is Korean, there is a Chinese influence in the architecture and layout.  While we were there, we were fortunate enough to catch the Changing of the Guard ceremony at 1pm. This takes place a few times a day. The palace is one of the top-rated places we visited in Seoul."
5536,5.0,"If you want to know the history of this country, you must come here."
5537,5.0,The place I most wanted to visit in Seoul. Why Buckingham palace when you have this in Asia? I'd vote Gyeongbokgung any day. Don't miss the change of guard!
5538,5.0,"This palace is an absolute must see in Seoul, they have a guard change ceremony every day at 1pm except Tuesdays, really impressive. The museum is close by and free of charge, good café over there for a short break and coffee."
5539,5.0,The layout is very similar to China's palaces as it is based on China's principles. However it has it's own charateristics especially in the backhouse. Charming.
5540,3.0,"This is th only palace we've visited in Seoul. Overall, it was okay, nothing spectacular but full of history. I especially enjoyed the museum part and the opening march in the morning coz it showed a brief preview of what is was like during the early days."
5541,3.0,"It was relatively easy to find the palace by metro. We arrived at 2 pm just in time to watch the changing of the sentries at the gate. The entrance fee is considerably cheap. However, you can only look at the palace from the outside and are not allowed to enter the buildings. This was a disappointment as it is better to walk through the buildings. Because we didn't follow a tour, we were unable to understand the culture or history except by reading the description on the plaques or by looking at the Chinese characters on top of each building. It is a relatively big place with a lovely lake that was frozen when we were there. Before we left, we also saw the changing of the guards at 3pm. It was an interesting visit."
5542,5.0,What you see in the Korean dramas are as perfect as this palace. Amazing architecture and landscape. You'll feel like a royalty as you traverse the surroundings. Try finding the secret garden too. Hold her hand and have a nice walk.
5543,3.0,"Much like the certain areas of the Forbidden City in Beijing, these are sets of buildings once used by emperors/royalty but on a regular day, they are mostly empty halls/rooms. Preserved well, though."
5544,5.0,"Even that this place is not recognized by UNESCO we found it quite impressive. There are plenty of things to see inside, to relax, think, learn... Definitely is the masterpiece of the Palaces in Seoul. My mouth waters when I think about this place again... The into drawback are the packs of tourist and even we visit with a freezing cold temperatures."
5545,3.0,"Again the palace had been mutilated by Japanese occupying forces. Infact the main frame of the palace was dismantled and a Japanese administration building was built right in the middle of the palace grounds. This building had just very recently been removed. Then they attempted to re create the original palace. The wood carvings on the ceilings are all gone, substituted with paper walls or just painted a plain green, To see what it had looked like, refer to the Forbidden City. The roofs are also recreated with cement instead of wood carvings and porcelain tiles and porcelain figurines. Very sad really. The Japanese occupying forces really even removed the historical past of Korea."
5546,4.0,"Certainly not the best palace we have ever gone to, the Forbidden City in Beijing is way better, but this palace is one of the best two that Seoul could offer. Granted, the architecture of the place was nice and grand. However, there were a lack of signs and enough explanations throughout the palace to explain what was in front of us. Try to go early to avoid the large amount of visitors."
5547,4.0,This palace was featured in so many K-dramas (e.g. The Moon That Embraces The Sun)! Very pretty palace indeed and there is a lake somewhere in the palace!
5548,5.0,First visit to this building But too bad since we were joining a tour package and we dont have enough time to explore the whole area. But I love the detail of the building.. with red and green colour domination. I should go again one day.
5549,5.0,"Beautiful architecture, managed to view the Guards' performance which was fun for the kids to do. Great photo opportunity. Lots of little shops and restaurants are located nearby too."
5550,5.0,"nice palace, can see some faint tint of chinese culture, been destroyed before however the stage pavillion is of original , so is the three chimneys located in the queen's garden. went during winter so it's of a calm serene feel but still fabulously grand."
5551,4.0,"full of tourist.. but like people say, you don't go to Seoul if you not go to this palace :) the palace is nice, even its crowded with tourist.. Nice experience"
5552,3.0,"This review is only somewhat helpful to those reading. I watched the changing of the guard, which was neat, and went inside the museum next door, but did not go inside the Palace (I felt it was a bit over priced and I was pressed for time). The changing of the guard is a popular attraction, so I figured it was worth mentioning here - it was an ok experience. They change approximately every 20 minutes if I recall correctly."
5553,3.0,"We visited this palace during winter so it was really cold to walk around the palace. Since the palace was burn down by Japanese and during the Korean Civil war, all the structures were rebuild. Some of the parts were not rebuild because no one know what the original structure looks like. There were exchanging guards ceremony everyday which was a highlight for visiting the palace. Other then that, go to China visiting the Chinese Palace seem more educational."
5554,5.0,"It was a beautiful sight, snow falling and on the ground. Very busy at 10am and 3pm but inbetween a lot quieter. See Korean History."
5555,4.0,"This has to be seen at least once to understand the grandeur of the palace and the surrounding buildings and grounds. If you see only one palace in Seoul, this may be the best.  Our timing was good and we were able to see a fun reenactment of an ancient changing of the guard. The National Palace Museum and the National Folk Museum are both in the same complex (and these two museums are free; the palace itself has a modest entry fee)."
5556,4.0,"To me, if you've seen one Korean palace you've seen them all, so if you're going to see just one, make it Gyeongbokgung. Check before you go so that you can get a tour. There are only three English language tours a day. The palace is a huge maze of buildings and it's easy to get disoriented if you're going through it on your own. Also, you have to go to the souvenir shop to buy the guide booklet, but it's only 500 won."
5557,4.0,"They maintain all of the artwork in its place beautifully... it was my first time in South Korea, I really miss the friendly people although the couldn't speak really good english."
5558,4.0,Amazing amount of shops in those 4-5 shopping complexes that open until 4.30am! My favourite shopping complex among all these is Migliore. You need keep shopping and learn about the price before buying because you may find another stall selling the same piece of clothing cheaper. High quality Korean clothes and fashion accessories at great prices
5559,3.0,It's not as luxury and huge if compared to Beijing Zhi Jing Cheng. Overall just walk around and take come pictures.
5560,4.0,"My main purpose is to watch the royal guards changing ceremony. I love to see guards wearing colorful clothings, with NO smiling face. Ritual are performed every day between 10am,1pm and 3pm in front of Heungnyemun Gate. Be there 30 minutes before ceremony started. You can enjoy photograph just next with guards, in 10 minutes session."
5561,4.0,I really enjoyed visiting this palace and learned a lot about Korean history and culture. Try to come early to avoid to many tourists. Korean museum is very close and you can visit for free and reentry to the palace again.
5562,5.0,"Pros: Beautiful Palace, well-maintained, and has guides during specific timings. Sadly, I missed it. But it was a sight to see.  Cons: There are many opened areas, I would suggest to bring along an umbrella or visit the Palace at a less sunny timing. The signboards around the Palace are pretty scarce, would help if there are more signboards to help introduce more to the tourists who aren't following the guides around."
5563,5.0,"It sits on top of the city's main road, on the skirt of the mountain hill, located wisely and strategically,in the heart of the Korean Nation. It is an oasis in the bustling city of Seoul. Once you are inside it feels as if you are somewhere totally different. It has the King's and Queen's premises and several other building compounds. What's interesting is, they are simply and efficiently designed. When you see this and the other historical buildings in the city and compare them with the modern buildings, the architectures of that time were way ahead of this century. The palaces suggest that those people knew how to built so many complex structures beautifully and aesthetically thousands of years ago, but they lost their memories somewhere along the time. I wish this kind of simplicity, efficiency and some of the aesthetics were used more often in their modern government institutions and establishments as well as residential high rises. There is a free guide tour in English every hour or so, you can join her and enjoy the history and the stories of the palace. Also there is a guards' changing ceremony, it is interesting to watch. Sorry that I can't remember the times. The tree leaves' autumn colors are adding more romanticism to the atmosphere if you visit in late October/beginning of November."
5564,3.0,Not much explanation in English. We tried getting audio guides but they were not available. Doesn't feel so special especially if you have been to similar but bigger places in Asia like the forbidden city.
5565,4.0,"When we arrived there, it was just about time of changing the officer of the palace... so watching it feels like we went to joseon dinasty... Love it... But seeing all the trees with no leaves because of the season, so I'm thinking, that this palace will look alot more beautiful in spring or autum."
5566,3.0,"Nice if you are into history and ancient architecture. Not too nice if walking around with kids due to uneven flooring slabs, plenty of steps. Good place for photography and watching the guards changing ceremony. Tosokchon is a hop and skip away though."
5567,3.0,"the palace is nothing to rave about, like most historical monuments in Korea, it was rebuilt recently, but the guides , who speak english, are so inventive and polite that they make the visit very pleasant"
5568,5.0,"Great slice of history. Highly recommend to appreciate the extent of Korean documented history. And very well kept--the Koreans are obviously proud of this. The changing of the guard ceremony was fun, too."
5569,4.0,Plan ur trip time carefully. Free english guided tour available at certain time(cant recall) pretty much strolling in the castle ground. The guards exchange ceremony is held in front of the castle gate (also at certain time of the day).
5570,5.0,"Very big place... in here like in a film Korean Dynasty.. There is a museum library inside this place, you need to visit it ..."
5571,4.0,"This is a must if you are in Seoul as there are so much to see and do around the area Recommend that you can start the morning walking around the strip just in front of the palace where there is a museum of sort underground. Then have boiled ginseng chicken lunch at a nearby restaurant (there is a famous one nearby) before heading to the Palace. At the Palace ground, you can witness the changing of guards, and sometimes traditional dance performance, and also a visit to the museum inside. Spend the late afternoon walking along the street at the right of the palace (when you are facing the main entrance) which are lined with boutique shops and restaurants. You can also walk up the hill and look at the traditional houses."
5572,4.0,Worth the visit as the place was really grand and it was right on the heart of the city. Get a good idea of how the ancient palace was and how the royals lived. Nice buildings and a nice park right at the back. Too bad most buildings were only rebuilt in the 1990s.
5573,4.0,"We did not really walk through all details but we admired the setting and space of the complex, the colors of Korea, the culture... Sit there just for the nature, or a walk at the garden and its nearby streets would be nice enough to spend the day."
5574,4.0,Well worth a visit and hopefully you will be as lucky as us to get a student guide that will show you around and be informative and all they want in return is to practice their english. These guides were waiting at the exit from the Metro Subway station.
5575,4.0,"This palace has an extensive garden, beautiful ponds and in November, the leaves in the park were turning yellow, red and gold. A nice quiet place to visit even with lots of people."
5576,4.0,Prepare to spend hours in this palace as you proceed from one section to another. You will get to see many different ranks of sections that you saw from K drama. Pretty interesting with various spot to explore.  This palace is huge so be prepare to have a little picnic in between your exploration by the pond to take a break to enjoy the scenery.
5577,4.0,"Built in 1395, this royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty is also known as Gyeongbok Palace. This is a fantastic palace situated right at the heart of modern Seoul downtown. A must-see for a visitor in Seoul, this palace showcases a medieval ritual of flag/march ceremony by modern soldiers trying to recreate the magic of ancient Korean empire.  A guide is recommended for exploring other various parts of the palace including interesting anecdotes about first writing of Korea, or how medieval Koreans used to keep their palace rooms heated without air-conditioning/gas heating technology."
5578,4.0,We reached the Palace around 11plus on a sunny day. It's the perfect timing to take nice shots under the hot sun despite there is cold wind. We tour around the whole palace & wanted to visit the Rose Garden but it was too tiring after walking for so long inside the palace itself.  Each building structure is still in good condition and the beautiful scenary is unforgettable. Do have a heavy breakfast before you visit the palace in case you ended walking for hours without knowing it.  We were so lucky to see the guard parade around 3pm and its magnificent before we decide to come out from the palace.
5579,5.0,I was only in Seoul for 3 days but this was the first palace I went to and my favorite out of all the ones I visited. It has the museum in the back which was free and fantastic.
5580,4.0,Interesting and a good walk. Also many interesting things to see in the vicinity. I would recommend it.
5581,3.0,"The day I went was cold and rainy, but we still walked the palace grounds. We didn't have a tour guide, so we didn't have the history behind what we were looking at. I would recommend getting a tour guide if you do go."
5582,4.0,"I had a great time walking around Gyeongbokgung. It is a massive ground with awesome architecture, courtyards and gardens which make for attractive photo opportunities. The site provides a quick glance into the history of the palace. I had a very peaceful time exploring the entire place and if you are willing, you can leave the hustle and bustle of larger groups by venturing deep into the gardens."
5583,4.0,"Because the Korean Dram Jewel In The Palace, i went to korea and my tour guide let us visit this palace  This palace has huge area and the scent made me feel i was back to ancient Korea  Dont forget to take a lot of picture there to prove u are already in one of beautifull palace at Joseon Dinasty  U can see at severall time an ancient soldier changes the duty like at Buckingham palace ( i forgot what time)"
5584,4.0,Great place to take photos. Big enough area so that you can get away from the tourist groups. We went in autumn and the leaves were nice reds and yellows.
5585,3.0,"The lieu is too picturesque during autumn, the weather is fine, but it's too crowded. It is best to save a half day of your travel itinerary in touring around. If you want to hear and learn more about the Joseon Dynasty and anything related to the Gyeongbokgung Palace, it is recommended that one should be in the area at around 11 AM. There are women in hanbok who will tour you around and explain details of the palace which the internet won't."
5586,4.0,"Little of the original old palace remains, and the ground houses mostly reconstructed buildings and museums, but it's pleasant for a few hours' of walk and exploration nonetheless. Don't expect anything remotely approaching the grandeur of Beijing's Forbidden City, but what it has is well kept and presented.  Despite the presence of numerous tour groups, the area is big enough that finding a quiet, scenic spot all to yourself is easy, all just a stone's throw from the bustle of city centre. The cultural park area to the east of site is free of charge and many Seoulites happily spend leisurely time there."
5587,5.0,"This is a reenactment of the changing of the Royal Guards during the Joseon Dynasty. The ceremony itself can be seen from outside the palace on the street. To tour the palace, tickets are required. (I also enjoyed touring the palace.) The traditional costumes and ceremonial aspects of the ceremony were beautiful. I was told that research was done to make it historically accurate. The whole ceremony takes only about 15-20 minutes. For something that is fun to see and no cost, I would certainly recommend it for visitors to Seoul, South Korea!"
5588,5.0,"If you do anything in Seoul, this is it. You can spend hours at Gyeongbok, and you can blow out your camera in the process. Recommend you take it slowly and explore all the nooks and crannies."
5589,4.0,"Huge courtyards! Beautiful place. You have to come here when it's sunny though.. Nice place to take pictures, i even saw a couple shooting there prewed pics here. The most interesting attractions was the guards that stood still like the guards in england, but with more colorful uniforms and hats.."
5590,5.0,It is amazing that you will find red leaves inside when travel in Autumn.
5591,4.0,Beautiful palace. We would have left much earlier if we didn't jump in with the English tour guide. Probably would have given a lower review if not for the guided tour. Without the tour there wouldnt have been much to see.
5592,5.0,"A wonderful place to see. I saw some previews of Korean telenovelas but I don't pay much attention to it. Seeing this place, now I appreciate it more. A huge place and lots of history in it. It's worth a visit or 2. Take your time."
5593,4.0,"At the entrance the change of guard is colorful, and inside is great ; in smaller scale reminding of the forbiden city in Beijing . Going on the left hand-side of the buildings toward the north are gorgeous gardens, even nicer that the secret gardens of the East Palace, then continue clockwise south to the entrance, pass the street, turn left and a few blocks away is Insa-Dong. Seniors entrance is free."
5594,5.0,Nice and beautiful especially when we visited because its autumn season. Love the colors and palace. I also enjoyed the watching the changing of Royal guards🍁🍁🍁
5595,5.0,"Excellent view of ancient history in a city that evolved around it! Grounds are well kept, convenient."
5596,5.0,"I really love it palace and open something new everytime. You can stay inside, look at palace or wall and see mountain or modern high-rise buildings. It is really lovely, you can take free excursion or go through to see Blue House"
5597,5.0,Don't miss the chance to visit this lovely palace and walk it's very large grounds. Gives a great perspective of the history in the region.
5598,3.0,"Change of guard is worth watching. The museum or place inside is small, nothing much to be seen. Ticket for just 1 palace is 3,000Korean Won."
5599,5.0,take a good camera much time and enjoy it .....its just soo beautiful .... alone to go around sea the nature and the buildings all those colors
5600,4.0,A very nice and easy tour. Please make sure you have an excellent guide who understands the complete history of the palace. Everyday at 10am the changing of the guards ceremony is a visual treat.
5601,4.0,"Had a very nice time here. The grounds are quite expansive, so put your walking shoes on. The English self guided walking tour was good. They didn't give you a lot of information at each site on the headset, so I would say that if you want more, sign up for a tour."
5602,3.0,"Yes! A very big one~~ We spend three hours here but still not able to make a round.. Maybe we stop too much. HAHA  My favourite band was here one the same time and day I was there.. But I missed them as the place is too big.. Visit the museum on the outside of the entrance before u left, U can learn lots regarding the palace there..  Two significant in one time.. Yeah! Gwanghwamun and Gyeongbokgung. Save the subway fare.. Plus, u can walk down to the Gwanghwamun Square to visit the King sejong statue and also the Admiral Statue.."
5603,4.0,"Interesting architecture mainly the imposing gates Changingc of the guards, 3 times a day. The pond is interesting too"
5604,4.0,"Great Palace, but tour is enhanced if take the audio guide. Check out the changing of the guard very interesting. Also Cultural museums on property are very interesting"
5605,4.0,It is a place you have to visit if you are in Korea. History and Korean tradition It is a place you have to visit if you are in Korea.
5606,4.0,Visited this palace with my family on amazing autumn day in October. My wife attended the free guided tour and it was rather comprehensive. Connected to the subway and directions are clear. Worth a visit.
5607,4.0,"Having a trip to Seoul isn't complete if you're not visit Gyeongbokgung Palace. You can see a history of South Korea. Try to explore all the places and you'll find the ancient feeling of South Korea. It's very big complex and you'll find many traditional houses of Korea. They have free guided tour to explore all the places, they provide English, Chinese and Japanese speaking guide. Please pay attention to the schedule, at that time my friend and i missed and we just explored by ourselves and naturally followed the crowd of group. hehehe.. There is a big beautiful pond inside. There are more building inside and some places you need to pay the entrance ticket again."
5608,5.0,"Come with an open mind and don't expect the palace to blow your mind off. This palace is not the most beautiful, impressive and ornate palace in the world but it has it's own charm. I guess ancient Koreans are not into manicured gardens and jaw dropping architecture.  But there were beautiful gardens and the the palace is very well maintained. I had fun exploring the palace grounds and it was nice to find a spot to sit down, and enjoy the cool breeze and just relax for a bit.  Visitors get to see a glimpse of how the royal family lived in the past. There's even performance on the changing of guards at the palace gates.  And if you have the time, follow the tour. it was very informative and the guide was pretty jovial."
5609,4.0,It sounds cliché... but you have not been to Seoul until you visit one of the five grand palaces built by the Joseon Dynasty. Gyeongbokgung Palace is the largest of the five. A must-see.
5610,4.0,It was the only palace we visited in our trip and it was really big and gorgeous. We spend nearly half day at this palace and the National Folk Museum just next to the palace.  It was the beginning of autumn and the view around the palace is so gorgeous. We followed a free English tour at 11am for an hour and our tour guide gave a very good explanation around the palace. Very informative indeed.  Totally worth it and i would highly recommend a visit to the palace if you are visiting Seoul.
5611,5.0,"Learn a lot on the history of Gyeongbokgung Palace with the palace tour guide giving a good historical background of the palace ground. I already visited this place twice, once during a cold, chilly winter in December 2013 and this year in June. Never gotten sick of it. I am looking forward to the palace kitchen being overhauled!"
5612,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is just a few minutes by foot to where we stayed. We booked for a free guided tour starting at 10am-11:30nn. We were 7 in the group including 2 kids. The guide gave us a very insightful overview of Seoul's history and it's architecture. The area is huge as well as the number of tourists. You can actually get inside and watch the changing of guards ceremony at the big open grounds just before the gate where you need to present the tickets. So if your schedule is really tight and just want some photos of the guard changing ceremony with their colorful outfits, just be there by 10am or 1pm, no need to purchase a ticket. Going out we passed by the Folk Museum and used the side exit that leads us to the Bukchon Hanok Village."
5613,5.0,"I visited many palace in Korea but this one was best one , when I entered the palace found a place which i could wear Korean dress for free and had 5 min time to take pictures with this beautiful dress . There is timetable for wearing dress so you have to wait in line for specific time , just 20 people each time can wear the dress not more . Don't miss cultural army marching in front of entrance too ."
5614,4.0,It's easy to get to Gyeongbokgung Palace by metro. The palace is big and has lots to see. I suggested not to go in winter cause it's too cold to explore the palace.
5615,5.0,Amazing palace. The architecture and artistry are breathtaking. It is well preserved and well kept. Definitely a must see piece of history in Seoul.
5616,5.0,"Beautiful and very well maintained. Continue along King Sejong Ave. and see the King's and also Admiral Yi's impressive monuments - against the background of the mountains surrounding Seoul. Amazing, considering that Seoul is a very large city."
5617,4.0,"Aside from the mesmerizing grandness and vastness of this place, the free shows (re-enactments) outside the palace gates does all the difference. It's not everyday that you get to be in a grandeur palace with ancient-looking guards performing right in front of you.  This place should be visited by everyone who visits South Korea."
5618,5.0,"This place was well worth the time and walk. It's quite massive and full of history. You will find yourself taking photo after photo. If you have kids that don't like to walk much, make sure you have a stroller, etc. Highly recommend this spot."
5619,4.0,"When I visited this place in mid of October 2014, the troops parade has been started. I have to run fast to take their pictures. I was so happy to see them, feeling like in Joseon era. The whole building are amazing. I love the architectures of this palace."
5620,5.0,"ceremonial guards, gorgeous landscaped, well maintained grounds, organized and inexpensive. A lovely way to spend part of your day. Also if you just want to pass through on your way to other locals such as Bukchon and Samcheong. Enjoy"
5621,4.0,"GyeongBokGung is perfectly located, with the packdrop of the BukHanSan mountain on one side, and the modern buildings of JongNo on the other. This makes for stunning pictures and an amazing setting. Also noteworthy is the grand entrance from GwangWhaMun Avenue (with the statues of Admiral Yi Sun-Shin and King Sejong the great), as well as the changing of the guard at the front gate of the palace. The palace itself is very nice, large and extremely well maintained, with a nice natural area (with gardens, lakes) on the North Side. I'm ""only"" giving it 4 stars because as the ""national touristic attraction of Korea"" the palace itself doesn't rival in size with similar world renown landmarks in other cities (Forbidden City, Versailles...) and people with very high expectations could get disappointed a bit."
5622,4.0,this is where I found a picture perfect view. I feel like I'm one of the Korean novella star. The place is huge. I find it hard to find the exit bec. they don't provide a map
5623,4.0,"It is a grand palace with major restoration after destroy during the Japanese invasion. There are tourist guides with multi language which you can join at your own interest. The english speaking guide have clear pronunctiation and easily to understand. By standing in the palace, you can imagine and position yourself like you are in the dynasty of Joseon. It is a good experience to feel the ancient noble arts."
5624,3.0,This is a very grand palace made of wood with all the pretty engravings. Gyeongbokgung is the place where the King sits in. You will get to see the original seat where the king sit in in Korea.  There are also guards standing outside the door and if you are lucky enough you will get to see them change shift and do some marching along the front door.
5625,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung palace was awesome! The grounds are beautifully kept and very large - we could have easily spent half the day walking around the paths to check out the gorgeous architecture. The grounds is connected to a museum that boosts some of the nations greatest artifacts. Keep in mind that this place can get very crowded with tourists and children on field trips, so I recommend trying to go during the week day. The cover price is fairly cheap (about $4 USD), but you can also purchase a ticket book that is good for the rest of the month to visit the other nearby Palaces in the area."
5626,4.0,"The courtyard portion does not require a fee and may be enough for most for the visit. Especially, to watch the changing of the guard. The entry price was reasonable, so probably worth it. A free English tour is available, but did not use it because of time constraints."
5627,4.0,"We arrived at the palace in time for the changing of the guard - a colourful ceremony that was brief enough for even the most impatient amongst us to enjoy. We then took a walk around the palace which is a shadow of its former self, having been burned down by the Japanese. What has been rebuilt is fine on the whole but there are some real highlights like the pagoda on the lake."
5628,4.0,"For those who like Korean architecture, this is a treat. I joined an English guided tour hoping to learn more about the historical stuff behind the place. Unfortunately, the group was quite big, and the tour guide was using a tiny loud speaker, and so most of the time I couldn't hear what she said. Which was a shame. They could have use those wireless units or limit the size of the group. What you see here are just buildings, and no artifacts. For those you'll have to go to the museum."
5629,4.0,Were lucky to catch glimpse of changing of guards. Was very colourful & interesting. One complaint though: very dusty as palace ground is sandy
5630,5.0,Except for a few buildings this is a recreation but what a fabulous recreation. We took one of the English tours and it was really interesting. The building are absolutely amazing. It was crowded in the main areas but the grounds are so vast it was easy to find quiet places to photograph or relax. Don;t miss the changing of the guard ceremony it is picturesque and colourful
5631,5.0,"Love, love, love the place - nice excursion, touch of the past - magnificent. I went to the place on my last day in KOREA AND WOULD NEVER FORGIVE, IF I WOULD NOT SEE"
5632,4.0,"Lovely place. I especially liked the pond with the coy fish. There were a lot of noisy school kids at the gate that were shouting ""Hello, hello"" at western tourists which was annoying, but luckily the kids scattered around the large area after the gate so we could enjoy rest of the visit."
5633,4.0,"Went on a Chinese holiday so it was quite busy, but the grounds were clean and had lots of greenery."
5634,5.0,"This was such a great place to visit!! The buildings are lovingly and beautifully maintained and there was so much to see!! The history of Korea was fascinating, so much I didn't know!!"
5635,4.0,"Though this Palace is Seoul's grandest, it was certainly not built on a grand nor large scale as BeijingForbidden City.  What i am surprised was that the moment we exited the Metro station, we were met with a strong 'sand storm'! And this had continued throughout the next one hour or so when we toured the Palace!  We were surprised as well as disappointed that the Korean Government did not invest in well paved roads inside their supposed grandest Korean Palace ! Instead, sands were seen everywhere, in between buildings and practically - everywhere!  I would strongly suggest ladies to tie up your hair or at least wear a cap as well as put on your sunglasses!  Maybe it was the time of the year we visited (October)? Anyway, you have been forewarned!"
5636,4.0,Want to know about Korean history and culture this is the place Lot of character and it portraits the life style of the kings.
5637,4.0,"Not quite as par- like as the other nice palaces, but grander and very nice. Close to City Center, of course, and an easy walk."
5638,3.0,"This is the biggest palace in Seoul. In my opinion, it is not the most beautiful one. Changdeokgung palace is better. The layout of the buildings is not as aesthetic as Changdeokgung's. Landscaping is noting to shout about. However it has daily changing of guards display to keep visitors engaged. It is good for a stroll."
5639,3.0,"As a keen photographer we stopped short of entering. There were literally thousand of people there when we went! Luckily the entrance gate had guards dressed in full regalia and I got some awesome photos of them! (free) and some art shots (close up) in the first courtyard. Worth a look as a photographer if it is very quiet, but there is a better temple (see my other tripadvisor review). Take your choice...."
5640,5.0,We had a great time here. Our tour guide was a plus as he gave us plenty of historic information as we walked around. I liked that this palace contained traditional furnishings in some of the buildings. We even saw the changing of the guards!!!
5641,5.0,the entrance to the palace is just the beginning and is usually crowded. move further at the back where the pond is. its quiet and less busy in the forested area. there's a huge mountain in the background if you move past the pond.  make sure you allot half-a-day to explore this palace to make the most out of it!
5642,4.0,The palace is quite huge so we were lucky to have followed a free English tour guide from the visitor center. We avoided the crowds as much as we could while still seeing all the major attraction the palace had to offer. The tour was almost an hour long but it gave us further insight to the history and lives of those living inside the Gyeongbokgung.  The ticket also comes with free admission to the folk museum located within palace grounds.
5643,4.0,"The change of guards ceremony was not too bad, the palace is huge with lots of turning, prepare to walk alot to explore the whole palace, at the end of the palace, there is a free museum to visit. I highly recommend the museum if you wanna know more about korea history."
5644,5.0,A must see while in Seoul...to complete your visit. Take the Seoul City Tour for the day which offers a trip to all palaces in the city.
5645,5.0,This is the big one with an entire garden area attached. Lovely. They usually have some sort of show so that the area gets very crowded. At the top of Gwanghwamun street.
5646,4.0,"We did one of the free tours and found it useful for the history and background, making sure we saw all the highlights, and saving us from crowding around the information boards to read descriptions. Tours start just inside the ticket gate near the information booth on the right. Though the website (which also has the times) says the tour numbers are capped, they aren't in reality. You can see the changing of the guard at the front gate without buying a ticket or entering the palace, as it takes place between the front gate on the main road and in the courtyard before the ticket gate."
5647,4.0,"There are so many palaces that one can visit in Seoul alone, but Gyeongbokgung Palace should be THE go to palace. It is the largest one in Seoul. If you are not a palace person, going to this one will definitely be satisfactory. Like in most palaces in Seoul, you'll find here the famous pillars, well-manicured gardens, the intricate Joseon Dynasty design, well-restored hanoks and the must-see changing of guards. Walking around here can be very tiring, but it's going to be worth it because there's a lot of beauty to see. You will feel like you are away from the hustle and bustle of the city outside its walls.  This palace is also very near one of many art and culture hubs in Seoul, Samcheongdong.  There is a money changer right beside the ticket counter, but do not have your dollars exchanged here. Last time I was there 1USD=985krw. Have your dollars changed in Namdaemun Market or Myeongdong Shopping District instead.  And again, do not miss the changing of guards ceremony. You can experience this even if you will not pay for the palace entrance (I think), so do not miss it!"
5648,5.0,"Great palace, for reference it is much smaller than the forbidden city, but the gardens and the lake give something else to this palace. In my opinion it would be my first choice when comparing with Changdeokgung, nevertheless both attractions deserve a visit. I would set from 90 min to 2h for a good look around."
5649,4.0,"This was the first palace that I visited in my trip to Seoul, Korea. I expected the compound to be big, but I just never realized how really big it is. It's such a beautiful place. I was there early this Spring and there are blossoms everywhere. I wish I had more time to just sit down and just admire the beauty at the lake. Make sure you wear a good pair of shoes because there's lots of walking involved."
5650,4.0,"This place was good but just a little bit fake, everything was tooo perfect. The bricks the structure and the paint. I am not sure if this is a newer building. It was so hot, however it was relaxing."
5651,3.0,"It was an unintentionally visit for me. Been there since 2013, 13 hrs before my next connecting flight so that was the chance to get around in the city.  The palace has nothing much to see, building style is the combination between Japanese and Chinese. I was not sure about the ticket price but it was worth for paying.  If you wanted to pin this on your travel map that's fine, but for me once is enough. There is something else to see in Seoul."
5652,4.0,Very relaxing to wander around and take your time to just look. If you prefer you can go on a guided tour.
5653,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung palace was the first royal palace built in 1395 during the Joseon Dynasty. But it was devastated by the Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592 and the restoration began in 1990 and revealed what it is today. The palace consists of official quarters, living quarters and resting places. The most representative structures of the Joseon Dynasty, Gyeonghoe-ru Pavilion and Hyangwonjeong Pond are still relatively intact.I recommend you take a special trip to Gyeonghoe-ru Pavilion. For this tour, you must reserve in advance via internet or phone."
5654,5.0,But didn't do tour. Investigate if you can go in without a tour. That would be great if you could. We were lucky to catch a traditional show in front of the palace during a cultural event. Also a laser show on the front wall/gate. Check for events there!
5655,3.0,"This palace is seriously run down by tours, and it gets super packed for the changing of the guard. It is really just a reconstruction and thus historically it is of limited interest. Changdeokgung is countless times more interesting to be sure to check out that one."
5656,4.0,"I could only spare a couple of hours for Gyeongbokgung Palace, and I recommend that you allot more time for this. It's a lot like the Forbidden City in Beijing, but I found there were more green areas where you can walk and just sit.  Didn't take a guided tour, so I just figured out my own routte.  To the left side of the main corridor, there's a larger area. One of the pavilions has a man-made lake in front of it, with benches along the edge. You can spend a few minutes sitting there, just taking it all in.  There was also a Janggu exhibit. Janggu are those big jars where they store Korean sauce in. The exhibit was in one of the inner areas, and tells you about how they prepared the Korean sauce.  In one of the inner areas, you might also find painters along one of the ponds. It gave off a very peaceful vibe.  Went there in late September, so the weather was beautiful and I went on a weekday. There were more than a few kids on a field trip there, but it still wasn't crowded."
5657,4.0,"Nice view of the past. September was a good time of the year to visit - not to crowded. Majestic buildings, lots to see."
5658,4.0,"We were with a group, so we had a guided tour. Lovely grounds, nice views of the surrounding area. Interesting to see a palace in the middle of a bustling city!"
5659,5.0,Amazing complex of palace with extraordinary art and architecture. It also has colorful painting. Perfect when in bright day.
5660,3.0,Very beautiful palace with a very tranquil feeling. Really worth a visit. So much history. The staff is very helpful.
5661,4.0,"We lives in modern city, it is very unlikely for us to see such palace. It really nice and spectacular. Lots of tourists visit too. Entrance fee: 8,000won (can only visit 1 palace)The palace book guide cost 500won whereby you buy and bring it with you. If you wanna to visit all the palaces, you can buy from here too (cost more). Recommend for those whom really likes historic buildings and not likely to see in own country."
5662,5.0,Definite must see for the cultural aspects. You'll need at least 3 hours here (if you walk fast). Go during a good lighting day there are lots of color & details.
5663,5.0,"I went to the palace in April 2014. Although it was very busy with lots of us ( turists ) I was able to enjoy the whole visit. You can rent the audioguides for few Won, just need to leave you ID with the officer, but I think it was really cheap, like 2-5 dolars per device. You can actually walk around and enjoy the most amazing historic places inside the place, and if you are K-Drama fan like me you will be transported to Faith ( drama starring Lee- Minho ) the rooms, the gardens, everythign was breathtaking. A recommended visit..You even have access to the front of the Blue House once in there, for not addictional cost ..Back again to K-dramas ( City Hunter starring Lee-Minho) If I ever visit Korea again I will go and make a more paceful visit, slower and take way more photos.Bring your camera along, or you will be missing spectacular picture moments."
5664,4.0,"We asked the taxi driver for Changdeokgung but he took us here instead. Apparently Changdeokgung is closed on Mondays. This place is huge & simple, not much to see except for the Korean Folk Museum. We missed the National Museum, so make sure not to miss it. We also watched the palace guards marching in traditional costumes. Lots of photo opportunities. Overall a very good visit."
5665,5.0,This is by far the best palace Ive been to among the five palaces. Especially the palace in the lake. Allot 2-3 hours when visiting this place as this is really breath taking.
5666,5.0,"Seoul is a very interesting city in that there are palaces in the middle, while being surrounded by skyscrapers. This particular palace was incredibly majestic, and it seemed that even locals go there just to relax on the palace grounds. You can definitely spend a whole day exploring the different areas, and a guide book is only 50 cents CAD."
5667,4.0,"I really enjoyed learning the history and culture of South Korea, and this was a nice place to start, incredible workmanship and ingenuity, in a beautiful park like area.."
5668,3.0,"Very big & crouded palace. From my visit, after doing pretty much all the palace section, I've came to realize that it pretty much looked the same.. Therefore, it's up to you guys to decide if it's really worth it. I did enjoyed the guard change !"
5669,5.0,"You don't need more than 1.5 hours to conduct a thorough visit of the Palace grounds. We knew exactly what we wanted to see, and the map we had made it easy to follow along. Looking at the map, you can proceed through each quarter in the numerical order indicated. You'll find yourself eventually graduating from the Southern wing of the Palace to the Northern one as you visit each quarter in that order. My favorite sights were the Hyangwonjeong pavilion and Gyeongheoru pavilion. I would also pay to see this place in the Winter when it's covered by snow. Finally, my understanding is the Palace was built, destroyed, and rebuilt several times over the past several hundreds of years. Keep in mind the quarters are as close a replica as it gets to those in which the King lived/held his meetings/etc... but they're not authentic."
5670,5.0,We loved the ease of access to all areas of the palace and temples. It was a lovely warm day and we enjoyed the exercise. The ornate buildings and statues were very cool and good information was available to read at each location. Nothing to dislike here.
5671,3.0,"I didn't actually go inside the complex (I did this for the other palace Changdeokgung Palace) but the exterior was really nice and I got to see the changing of the guards which was a really cool experience, so I recommend sticking around to see that if you can!"
5672,4.0,"Area was huge, you could probably get lost if your sense of direction is not that good. We had a tour guide so it was easy for us to go to the other buildings. The area was reconstructed because it was damaged during the previous world war and a lot of construction is still ongoing when we went there (kitchen area being built). Very good work on the buildings though and all of the decorations done. You really need to checkout the golden dragon on the ceiling if you are there."
5673,5.0,Very well kept & informative. Nice refreshment stop to rest up from alot of walking. Not allowed to enter the buildings but that is probably why they are in such god shape.
5674,5.0,"Book the secret garden tour as well, and book in advance. Its a long walk about 2.5 hours but easy to do and well worth the effort. The place has been kept in immaculate condition. I would highly recommend this tour while in Seoul."
5675,3.0,"The palace is old, and surprisingly small. Perhaps I just did not see too much into the history of the place. I noticed though that they have put more significance in places that would not have been significant had it not been for tourism purposes. But the facade of the building is interesting. It is a good place to visit one time. Just to get it out of your system. But not to revisit."
5676,4.0,"Following the style of the Forbidden City in Beijing, Gyeongbokgung is much less impressive but what's great about it is the pine grove and white sand ground that make it feel so aged and natural. In ancient time, Korea didn't have a big forest to build a large palace as China did. The woods for the palace were delivered from China, to whom it used to submit. Thus the houses are much smaller, especially the doors are low and narrow. Interesting place to learn about the country."
5677,2.0,You can pass this place. You could check out the guard changing ceremony if you like that kind of stuff.
5678,4.0,A nice palace within the vicinity of the city. A pale comparison to Forbidden Palace in Beijing. But anyhow a nice place to visit when you visit Seoul. The Museum there is also very good.
5679,4.0,"Lovely grounds but the ratio of strolling to special sights was not ideal, and it was easy to get lost. The best part really was getting there -- walking up the boulevard past two massive statues of war heroes, ideally when dark enough to see the entrance all ablaze."
5680,5.0,Very important historical and quiet place I suggest for all travelers of Seoul.
5681,3.0,"Pretty palace with nice scenery. It is fine to go here just to look at the entrance, try on traditional clothing, take some photos and watch the guards. Don't really know what the tickets were for, all the fun was outside."
5682,5.0,This place is really wonderful!! Just hope that it is not so hot like when I went! I would go back here so that is why I'm giving it an Excellent rating. And only $3 to get in - awesome! They have a beverages and gift shop if you need that. I want to go back for the free English tour in the early afternoon. There is quite a bit of walking around here so those with trouble walking should beware. Bring your camera. I walked here from the Folk Museum.
5683,4.0,"Amazing place to visit to know a bit of more Korean culture while in vibrant Seoul. Very easy to reach, just follow the direction of Palace going out of Gyeongbokgung subway station - the map is described on official website (http://www.royalpalace.go.kr/html/eng/guide/guide03.jsp?dep1=1&dep2=3). On the same website is the information about free tours in English. The ticket costs 3000 wons for the whole site and I advise to take one of those free guided tours, so you learn a bit more about culture, history and architecture. However, it was very difficult to get used to my guide, since she had a very strong Korean accent, it still gave me a small insight into the place. I've been there at around 13h and saw the ending of the traditional guard show, which was fantastic experience!"
5684,4.0,i work in the city of seoul and having such a great tourist spot is just amazing. the trip was just a walk away from the hotel I am staying at I just joined in some of the tourist
5685,5.0,"While living in Korea, we traveled to and visited many sights. The palaces located in Seoul make it easy to travel a short distance to be transported back in time when emporers ruled. This one is beautiful in many season and relatively flat for those with physical impairments. And the admission cost is perfect for me as I'm a shoestring-budget tourist, by choice."
5686,5.0,"Three are not only king's and queen's office and living rooms, but also a large museum with full history of Korea. Beautiful gardens and pond make me feel peaceful and healthy while I and my family walk on unpaved ground"
5687,5.0,Be prepared to walk and walk and walk. Toilets are strategically located. Impressive maintenance of the gardens! Especially the trees! Keep up the good work!
5688,5.0,"Gyeokbokgung palace is the biggest among the 5 palaces in Seoul. I recommend that you visit this and wait for the changing of the guards. Entrance fee is cheap, 3,000 won. It takes around 2-3 hours to fully explore the palace complex. Also, do not forget to try hanbok costumes."
5689,4.0,I cannot believe the bus loads of tourists I saw at this place. This is the most popular palace in Seoul. The backdrop on the mountain makes it more elegant and it is also close to Gwahamun Square. We paid US$3 to get in.  The grounds is quite large and there are two museums on its premises. I love the ponds with pagodas in them. I also love the structure with no paint on them and even the display of the jars were beautiful. We were able to see the entire place except for the museums although we entered one of them.  I also love the horsemen statue in the platform of the subway station near the palace.
5690,5.0,"This palace is unbelievably large. You definitely want to have a guide, whether a human guide or an electronic one. We were traveling with our own guide and we learned so much about the Korean people and the buildings in which their royalty lived. The buildings are beautifully painted, with very bright colors. Be sure to look at the ceilings in all the buildings because they are decorated very elaborately (inside and out). This is a ""must see"" in Seoul!"
5691,4.0,I suggest you take the guided tour because you would understand why the palace was created as such. Visit is not complete without witnessing the changing of guards. Be aware of the schedules for these two.  The place is big and is full of people.
5692,4.0,"I took a guided tours to visit the Palace. Gyeongbokgung itself means ""the palace blessed by Heaven"". This is a complete historic building to let you learn more about Korean people way of life and their historical life. I would recommend to take guided tour because of not so much signage or maps available to allow self guided tour. If you are lucky, you will be able to see the Guard Change ceremony on the main gate. Behind this palace, there is a Presidential House called 'Cheonghwadae' or 'Blue House'. Prepare yourself for a lot of walking, from the main gate to the exit gate."
5693,3.0,Good way to spend a couple of hours in Seoul. Guided tours are essential because there is not much in the way of signage or walking maps available to allow you to do a self guided tour. The complex is sprawling so without a tour guide you will have no idea what you're looking at. Be prepared for lots of walking. Interesting look inside the Korean imperial court during the Chosin dynasty.
5694,5.0,"I had the opportunity to visit this amazing compound during a 14 hour layover in Seoul. Awesome train ride from Incheon Airport into the city and voila! there you are all of the sudden facing this gorgeous monument surrounded by a modern world beyond it's walls.  This 619-year old beauty is a must visit regardless of the length of your visit to Seoul. You will, without a doubt be inspired and in awe. From the ceremoniously dressed guards and the colors of the ceilings to the contrast of the beautiful mountains and modern buildings, this is one of the best preserved historical sites you will ever see."
5695,3.0,"Actually got the 3 palace day pass and went to gyeongbokgung, cheongdukgong, the shrine and secret garden. Initially it was all pretty interesting with the architexture and all, but quickly got monotonous since all 3 palaces were almost the same. Advise: Go with the tour, you ll learn a lot more and feel more engaged, and skip on the other 2 palaces. One is more than enough. Shrine and secret garden good for taking pictures"
5696,5.0,"This is unique place which a must visit place in Seoul. This is a palace spread over a large area where, you can feel the ancient times of Korea.  I was there with a Korean friend where we managed to join the free guided tour (as I remember starts at 3:30 pm). If you have any interest on history or like to know some info about this palace, I recommend you to join this free tour where a guide English speaking guide takes the group for guided tour almost for a hour. Most of the things that you learn from this tour cannot be grabed by just walking around in this place.  I’m not a big fan of Korean dramas, still I enjoyed this visit. If you are a fan of Korean drams related to historical event, this is a must visit place.  Seoul museum is also located in the same premises, so you can visit there also. If you have some sort of an interest on history and have 1-2 hrs to spare, don’t miss this experience. This will give you a memory to recall that you visited Korea.  If I happen to visit Seoul again, I will repeat this visit."
5697,3.0,Not really a person who likes historical buildings but be prepared to walk if you are going to explore the place as the whole place is HUGE!
5698,4.0,"This was similar to all of the rest of the palaces. However it had one of the buildings on a lake here, which was really pretty. This was extremely busy but worth a look round. It was a lot bigger than Changdeokgung Palace, however once you had seen one of the buildings you had seen them all!"
5699,5.0,"Solemn and dramatic, the guards and the music along with blossoming trees make it beautiful. Check the schedule, come at 10 AM. Inside it's just a nice place to walk, we loved it. At the end take pictures with guards, they don't mind it."
5700,5.0,you have to visit this place - it is very beautiful and peaceful. have a time for meditation. you can also find some quite place and have a picnik.
5701,5.0,Super good palace and it is quite large. Slow down your pace while you visit this palace. Sit somewhere in the palace and that is really tranquillising. Mesmerising scene!
5702,4.0,"This is the 1st place i visit when i reach Korea. The palace has so many visitors and majority of them are the Koreans. If you ever watched an old Korean drama series and wish to feel how the era looks like, you have to visit this palace. The area are so big, and the buildings are as it should looks like. Great view."
5703,4.0,"The palace was very busy when we visited it. There are various tours that take place, and you can get a guided tour if you want. We chose to just stroll through the various buildings and gardens. It's a really well maintained complex, and the gardens around the palace are a great place to relax after you tour. There are information boards all around to read about about the various functions of the buildings you are viewing. It's very centrally located and is close to other attractions in the city. You also have great views of the mountains near Seoul."
5704,4.0,"We hired through Internet a free guide, from some group of volunteers and it was a very nice old man, Mr.Lee, who spent more than 2 hours explaining us everything about the palace and the buildings that compose the place. A good experience that I recommend everybody to do, cheap and worth it."
5705,4.0,"This was our first visit to a Korean Palace. Overall a good experience, the place grounds are extensive and there is alot of walking. Did not take a guided tour although that might have been better. The buildings all look the same and you cannot enter most of them. They have a formal changing of the guard every so often, we just happened to arrive when they were conducting it. Also at the end of the day (near 5PM) they have a ceremony with traditional dress and pomp and circumstance where teh guards march around and there is a marching band of sorts. We visited in late July which is quite warm in Korea but this day it was cooler with lower humidity. If you go in summer expect it to be very hot and humid. There is a fee to enter the palace grounds and another fee to be able to go to the pavilion which is in the middle of a small pond/lake. We did not visit the pavilion. The cost to enter for 2 adults and 1 child (11 years old) was around 10,000 Won. This cheap in my opinion."
5706,3.0,This is only a small palace compared to others in Asia and not as interesting. The changing of the guard ceremony was very touristy and not the real thing like Buckingham Palace. The museum was only average also. I would only recommend this palace for its history.
5707,5.0,"I suggest to read a little about Gyeongbokgung before visiting the area. This way you will be able to appreciate the place more.  The palace is huge and each building has it's own story to tell. Go to the large open space compound and you will see small erected rocks. Those are used to separate different ranks for ancient Korean officials.  ”一” = grade one (highest rank) ”二” = grade two ""三” = grade three ""四” = grade four And lower  If you see the center pathway, you will notice the center walkway is higher than the rest. The center walkway is walked by the king. The side pathways are for generals and scholars separately. You will notice huge ring like object on the floor at each side of the compound. It is used to pitch shelter if it rain. But it's only for Grade 1 to Grade 3 officials only.  Read more and be Wow!"
5708,5.0,one of my most favorite places we visited while in seoul. absolutely gorgeous palace. would love to visit again.
5709,4.0,"Saw a guard changing ceremony there. Is a good place for sightseeing and photo ops, LOL. Also, if you like the ancient Korean heritage, this is the place. The information are also clear and they are everywhere, so don't be afraid you've got lost :)  Nearby, there are also a Children's museum (?) that you can also visit by paying some fees. I don't know much since I am just passing by, but I saw the sculpture on their front door. It seems nice."
5710,5.0,"I visited this place as part of my short Seoul trip.  I loved the amazing view from the statues on Sejong - it looks really great for a European who has never been to this type of Asian culture before. We spend there two hours of incredible walk - having a local friend who gave us some insight on Korean culture. Every part if completely different and worth of visiting - lake, buildings etc.  The only negative aspect was the fact, that inside the buildings there is almost nothing - completely different from the collections inside the European castles."
5711,4.0,"The guard change adds a historic feel to the place as they really dress up for it. Overall the place is huge and is best seen with a guide, as you get insights into things you wouldn't otherwise pick up on your own (not many signs or explanations) or from your guidebook. Such as - who's the most powerful person in the palace? Hint: It's not the king!"
5712,4.0,This palace complex is very large. It is also pretty busy. We saw lots and lots of tourists from several countries. The National Folk Museum and Palace Museum are also here. You could probably spend an entire day here if you wanted to. We just spent a couple of hours. It's conveniently right off the subway as well.
5713,4.0,"This place is large so expect to spend more than an hour inside. Reached there just in time for the first changing of guards ceremony. Should watch if you have not seen it. There are guided tours for English and Chinese. Though it's not UNESCO certified, but it's the first palace build. Worth visiting if you just want to pick one palace to go to out of the many other palace around the area."
5714,5.0,"coming from a country that nothing much historical monuments were still intact, these kind of places in S.Korea tickles my interest. took a lot of cool pictures here."
5715,5.0,"There are complimentary lockers for visitors to put the shopping bags. A big place to see, with restored furnishings. Easily accessible by train, with artifacts displayed along the passageway. The change of guards ceremony is very realistic"
5716,3.0,The palace inside it self has many restoration going on. The place is quite pack with people. The palace it self is colorful and the palace ground is peace and quiet. If your planing just a stroll around. It would be a great place.
5717,3.0,"I think the restoration has not ended yet, you can only walk on the outsides of the buildings and it has been restored from the ground so it has this feeling of being a little bit like a theme park.  Said that it is still a nice play to walk inside and to compare it with European palaces, it is pretty different in concept."
5718,5.0,This palace is a beautiful example of historical Korean architecture. It is wonderfully colorful and the palace grounds are a peaceful respite from the hustle and bustle of the city that surrounds it. Plan to spend at lease a few hours while there. The walkways are coated in small gravel so I recommend closed toed shoes. There are food and drinks available for purchase.
5719,5.0,You can watch the changing of the guards free at the main entrance of the palace. It was captivating. Traditional Korean dress and customs on show lovely.
5720,5.0,This is a must see place in Seoul! Our tour guide has so many interesting stories during our walk tour. It's a nice feeling of having a chance to glimpse Korea culture. The palace is so grand and there are multiplex structures besides it which is just as interesting to see...  There is also a museum near the palace which you can do a quick tour.
5721,4.0,This palace is right beside the Folk Museum of Seoul so you can spend a good half day here seeing both. Recommend if you want to see more then just a palace!
5722,4.0,"Interesting history, the palace is very well conserve and maintain, lots of rebuilding, since some had been destroyed by Japanese occupation period. Very easy to come by subway, exit virtually inside the palace area. One of the must visit places in Seoul."
5723,5.0,"When I was in Korea 55 years ago, this location was the previous Japanese Headquarters Building. These grounds are amazing and I especially enjoyed the statues of the inventor of the Korean language and also the only Emperor to defeat the Japanese navy. If you had to choose between this and the Seoul Tower, go here."
5724,5.0,Complimentary English guided tours provided- the tour guide was extremely professional and helpful. Most beautiful palace
5725,5.0,Love it! Awesome view plus great architecture back in the olden days. We went on Wednesday and the admission was free. Yayyyy lucky us. Haha
5726,4.0,"3000 KRW to spend the whole day. You can op for a tour, or latch yourself with another tour (seen people doing that some time) pack some water and sandwich. It's hard to find food in the palace itself."
5727,4.0,Large sprawling complex somewhat spoilt by mass tourism and careless juxtaposition of modern buildings. Make sure you catch the changing of the guard which is colourful and take a short English tour.
5728,4.0,Enjoyed our time here. Only Few train stops from Myeongdong. Very serene. The place is well kept with beautiful gardens with mountain and lake backdrop. Loved the white and pink cherry blossoms
5729,5.0,"I love Gyeongbukgung,but maybe it's because it's the first palace I visited in Korea. The grounds are huge - the scope of the palace is really surreal.  There is a changing of the guards ceremony with music. You cannot go inside and crawl around the palace, no, but you can look inside some of the rooms.  The palace is also centrally located to the National Folk Museum (free and worth a visit) and Bukchon Hanok Village. Insadong isn't too far away either."
5730,5.0,"This was quite a nice and interesting place to visit. If you make it to the palace I recommend taking a tour, but it is still fun to explore on your own. when I went they were working on a few buildings but what is open is pretty amazing, especially if you are into history. And while there you might as well pop over into the national museum."
5731,5.0,You must never give this place a miss if you want to know more about korean history. Visit both place.... The royal palace itself and not to forget the folklore museum.... You will make your journey complete
5732,4.0,"The guard changing ceremony (scheduled at certain time of the day) was a pleasure to see. I like it.!. The show takes 10 minutes and then you can go take pictures with them. Go with the guide and listen to history will make the visit more interesting than wandering around aimlessly. After the 30-40 minutes tour, then be free to wonder around. The place is huge, exploring all of the place (alone) took about 3 hours. Nice souvenir shop and cafe as well selling quite expensive items but of very high quality. Locker is provided FOC."
5733,5.0,"This is the largest (huge) palace in Seoul and definitely everyone should visit the palace on their first visit, or even on the second if your coming in winter the palace is nice to see under snow cover. We got the Multi site tickets here which let us in to a lot of the temples around Seoul and saved some cash. The museum in the back was pretty interesting, not extremely exciting, but let you see a lot of props and artifacts of the time, showing how they lived and worked during the old era. The staff during the winter were nice enough to give out hand warmers on a bitter old day when we first came in January."
5734,4.0,"Our group went on a short trip to this palace, it was very easy to get to from the metro, even for people who don't speak a bit of Korean. We walked around, enjoyed the palace and gardens. It is close enough by some shopping as restaurants as well, so it is good place to make a day of sightseeing in Seoul."
5735,4.0,Love the place. Everything is well maintained. Went there during winter so it was really beautiful looking at the buildings encased in snow.
5736,5.0,"This temple is extraordinary! It is surrounded by breathtaking, mountainous views, and packed full of information regarding Korean Chosun Dynasty. Hour longTours are available in several languages, including Korean (of course), English, Japanese and more. A must-see!"
5737,5.0,"Lots to see at this palace! A piece of Korean history that will leave you in awe! Interesting and very peaceful. Ensure you get a chance to see the guards march and the traditional Korean singers and dancers. On top of all this, it was very affordable. Make sure you go:)!"
5738,5.0,The complex was large and walking was very easy - just make sure you budget enough time to see it all. It takes a bit to get from building to building without feeling like you need to rush.
5739,4.0,"A very large complex to walk around so for best understanding take advantage of the free English guide who meets you outside the information office for on the hour departures. Her tour took about an hour and her knowledge really did help as she explained the history of the palace from first being built in 1395, later burned and abandoned for almost three centuries, occupied and destroyed by the Japanese and then the start of the rebuilding in 1867. Oh and that clever old way of central heating. The reconstructions did not distract from the visit and overall we came away with a great feel for how Royal Life might have been. Look out for the changing of the guard ceremony - effectively hourly - and combined entrance into the Folk Museum"
5740,5.0,Architecture. The painting decorations on the wooden beams. I should have spent this day visiting the North and experience the thrill of being close to evil
5741,5.0,Take your time to stroll down the Palace and enjoy the beauty of the nature and old Korean architecture. Such a peaceful place.
5742,5.0,"Got a chance to visit The Secret Garden. It was quite lovely, although a bit of a hike. The Secret Garden area is wider than the Palace grounds itself, so try not to miss the tour there.  The Changing of the Guard Ceremony is of course a must-see. You can take a photo with some of the guards for the short time that they are posted by the gate."
5743,5.0,Come here early and plan to stay 3-4 hours. There are so many things to see ... some perfect places to take pictures. Make sure you are there for change of the guards.
5744,4.0,It's one of the place to visit as one of the most beautiful palace. There's a lot of things to see and it is a huge area.
5745,5.0,"This is on my list of must see on my first day in Seoul and it didn't disappoint. True to its description, it's a grand palace with imposing gates, stunning throne hall and large lawns for leisurely walks. The palace is huge and doesn't have much information around so it's advisable to go with a tour guide. Either join the free tour given by the palace or sign-up for free walking tours from visitseoul.net. I think the latter is much better because the group would usually be much smaller than the ones who join the free tour by the palace.  Once you're done touring the palace grounds you may want to check out the Blue House and National Museum which are both strategically located behind the palace. Oh! don't forget to checkout the changing of the guards at the from yard which happens like every hour or two."
5746,5.0,Much bigger than I thought it would be. Did the free English tour which is offered several times a day. Would recommend the tour as it told stories behind the buildings. There are no signs describing the buildings if you go on your own.  Changing of the guards was interesting to watch but seemed ingenuous and very fake formality.  Folk museum was very good and would recommend. Also nice place to cool off at the back of the palace complex.
5747,4.0,Good place to see in the heart of Seoul. Beautiful palace and lots of people. We got to see the beautiful palace.
5748,5.0,My first visit in Seoul was Gyeongbokgung Palace. We traveled there from Pyeongtaek by train and then subway. The subway brought us right to the palace. It was a warm day. We enjoyed watching the changing of the guards. They allowed tourists to pose for pics with the guards. I enjoyed the architecture. There were tours given in English but we did not have time to wait for it but would have liked to have gone. Water was sold for 1000 won which is roughly $1. The admissions was 3000 won per adult which is roughly $3 per person. This is worth a visit.
5749,5.0,"I lived in Seoul for one year before visiting this palace. I wish I would have visited sooner, this is the largest palace complex I have visited in the Seoul area. The palace, museum, and gardens make for an half day trip. We expected to spend about two hours on the palace grounds but actually stayed around four hours. I didn't get a chance to explore everything in that time. I will go back and visit again. If you want to visit a beautiful Korean cultural site I highly recommend this palace grounds."
5750,5.0,"I love this place during the winter. It's simply breathtaking. Gyeongbok Palace offers expansive royal grounds. A glimpse into the royal lifestyle during the Joseon Dynasty. They have changing off the guards, queens gardens, beautiful parks and tea houses all on the grounds. The colors and architecture are beautiful and it's really neat to have this piece of ancient history in the middle of the modern, urban, City Hall area, backdropped by glorious mountain peaks."
5751,5.0,More than meets the eye. The park and buildings go on forever. I highly recommend going on the free English tour to get the most out of the visit.
5752,5.0,"Incredible palace! A huge, sprawling complex of various different painted wood & stone buildings, spread over a large area near the middle of Seoul. Me and my sister were lucky, in that we just happened to visit while the changing of the guards ceremony was taking place. Very interesting ceremony with lots of traditional Korean dress and instruments. We also happened on a day where entry to the palace was free, although it is normally not that expensive.  Highly recommended for a nice chilled day out. We didn't visit the museum when we went there, but would like to if we go again."
5753,4.0,"Great architecture, nice clean parks, very near the presidential palace and the main square /street where the king statue can be seen. Also, you can wear a hanbok ( traditional korean costume ) for free in the middle of the square."
5754,4.0,"Things to bee seen : guards exchanging places, the palace and the most beautiful thing is the garden behind the palace overlooking the mountain."
5755,5.0,"Beautiful, picturesque palace against a mountainous backdrop. Loads of history to take in as you stroll the huge palace grounds. The ceremony for the changing of the guards is well-worth a watch."
5756,5.0,"It's the biggest palace in Seoul and worth a trip. Lots of history on the inside, flanked by high-modernity on the outside. You can wander around for hours. Buy the 50-cent guidebook and take yourself on a nice walking tour of the place. It really helps to understand the Korean culture and its history, and its just a pretty impressive place. At the very back of the palace is a back exit that leads to the front of the Blue House, Korea's equivalent of the White House, where it president lives. You can tell where to go by the guards who search bags at the exit. Walk through and you can walk back in by showing your ticket."
5757,4.0,"Walking along the pathway leading to the gates of the Palace i notice a tree full of yellow Pears that demand a snapshot.We dont have this kind of fruit trees in Malaysia.After paying for the entrance fee by our guide,we enter into this huge garden with old Korean style buildings,ponds,trees and the National Folk Museum.Especially like the various artificial display of Kimchi dishes.Lots of historical artifacts and a great place for photos.In one of the buildings outside there's a room with a display of traditional Hanbok - Korean Clothings that you can wear and take photos with.Did not see the changing of the guards though.Located in the middle of modern Seoul, its a must visit place."
5758,5.0,"This historical palace is located right in the middle of modern Seoul and this is so cool to see the contrast of the past and the future.  The palas has a very large area to walk and a lot of old buildings to see. The big building inside the lake is gorgeous.  Do not forget to visit the nice souvenir shop. You may also have a cup of tea inside. If you are in Seoul, you must see this palace."
5759,4.0,"It is a recommended place to visit, you can enjoy a traditional architecture in the middle of modern city"
5760,5.0,"We went off to view what we thought would be just another palace, and it was a bit more. We arrived as they changed the guard giving a good photo opertunity. The place was buzzing but because of it's size was able to appear less packed. Everything is well maintained and vibrant in colour, spotlessly clean and of great historical value. The extensive grounds are well kept and worthy of a walk around time permitting. Recommended"
5761,5.0,"This place was just breath taking! It is huge and the contrast of this palace against the backdrop of the modern city added to its excitement!  It has been restored over the years and there were still new parts that were being restored (kitchen area in particular). This small part of construction did not take away from the jaw dropping effect of this place. The attention to detail, from the original stone taken back from Japan to the extreme detail in the painting, was simply beautiful!  You need at least a few hours to properly explore this palace - which you can do at your own pace (with or without an audio guide (for an extra fee)) or join a guide for detailed information and history! You can then move straight onto the folk museum which is free of charge if you pay for the palace entry. We were also lucky enough to see the official changing of the guard - which was enriched in culture and more history!  They have even built a train station directly at the palace (you get off and basically walk into the palace) which is great for convenience and makes it very cheap to get to.  If you are struggling to decide on what to do or torn between what to see - you MUST see this!"
5762,5.0,Majestic palace right in the heart of the city. Fengshui dominates the place... The palace was built on sprawling grounds and to me it is the pulse of the city. As Korea does not have a royal family anymore this palace is not used now. The palace is so well maintained and cleanliness rules the day. Be prepared for a long walk thru the palace and stop to capture the artistic handiwork of yesteryears...
5763,4.0,"Beautiful palace with rich history. Absolutely loved the place. Stunning back drop. CHEAP entry, should definitely raise the admission price. Free entry to National Folk Museum.  It has a very handy location. A definite must see!"
5764,4.0,This was the 2nd time I visited this place but it never failed to took my breath away. Everything was so beautiful n stunning!
5765,4.0,"LOTS of history, lots of amazing Palaces and sight seeing places, and also a home of Kim Nam Jae's Hapkido gym. I highly recommend this place, and the famous chicken restaurants around it. Such as the Korean Chicken soup pass the Popeye's chicken place... ironically speaking."
5766,5.0,"We reached this palace right a few minutes before the guards changing ceremony at the entrance, so if you can catch this, please do so! We explored this huge palace after that and it took us a lot of time to explore this place. There are free tours available if you are interested to join. One of the must go places in Seoul!"
5767,5.0,I took the free English tour which was great as you heard a lot more about the place. There are lots of photo opportunities and I would recommend going at a time where you can see the changing of the guard ceremony.
5768,3.0,"I bought the entrance tickets for 3000KW with English Tour. It has other languages as well but subject to availabilities. The tour guide brought us through most part of Gyeongbokgung Palace and it lasted for about an hour, it could have been longer but partly cause of the rainy weather we skipped some. For photos, do visit http://nkikichua.blogspot.sg/2014/03/wanderlust-seoul-korea-day-2.html :)"
5769,4.0,"Must join the free tour!!! The tour guide was great, she told us about so many things that I otherwise wouldn’t notice. The palace was a bit crowded though and it would be better if the tour could be longer to go through more places. Anyhow, this is a must see location. If you are going to only 1 palace in Seoul, this is the one. Reserves at least half a day for this palace if you are joining the free tour and make sure you check the tour time before you go so that you wouldn’t miss it."
5770,3.0,"I suppose it's a must do if you are in Seoul but don't get too excited.  There are free English speaking tours throughout the day, we caught the 11 am one. The tour had about 40 people to start with and 25 by the end. I guess some got board.  The site itself is not that old as it was reconstructed in 1995 so don't go expecting ancient wonders. But it is a good place to visit to get some Korean culture."
5771,4.0,"Another side trip during a business trip in a cool winter season,,, getting around the place is quite challenging specially if one is not used to this kind of weather, great experience anyway specially seeing the traditional ""changing of the guards"",,,"
5772,4.0,When you get out from the metro subway you will find yourself stunts by the mega old architecture right in the middle of this seoul metropolitan city.  It feel like you travel the time back to where the King and the glory of Korean history.  One thing that I missed is the brief history or the explanation of the building meaning etc. If you like history means that you'll need a tour guide.  Not far from this palace you will easily find the national palace museum thatbalso beautifully arranged.
5773,3.0,Its like visiting a studio! A very interesting place to visit because you can wander around the palace and explore the history of the old and ancient Dynasty!
5774,4.0,"As said in the title, this palace is beautifully maintained. It's huge, so expect to spend a lot of time there, and although we had a difficult time finding the ""entertainment hall in the pond"", we were glad we found it. The whole place is like a maze without many signs, so make sure you have a good map or a guide. Most of the items are removed from inside the buildings but there are still things to see. It's worth your time. Parents with young kids, you need strollers for this."
5775,4.0,We went with our tour and she tell us the story of the beauty palace at the end we watched the changing of the guards
5776,5.0,"Me and my mom went there in the morning to walk around the palace and we were surprise that there is also ""Changing of Guards"" in the front area of Gyeongbokgung Palace (you may ask the ticket vendors for the schedule as this is only appears few times a day). If you are going around, you must be wearing comfy shoes at least and try to bring water because you might be surprised how big the Palace is. If you are fond of watching Korean Soap operas, you might consider yourself living in them because the palace is well preserved that it really looks like you are seeing the past and the traditions. If you get tired just a halfway, please take a good rest then try to finish all the buildings as this might surprise you a beautiful view. We went there last Autumn and seeing the whole Palace amazed me. However, if you want to know more details for every building, it requires a tour guide."
5777,2.0,"This is a grounds that contains a palace and various affiliated buildings. It was partially rebuilt in 1867. There is a modest 3000 won entrance fee so you are not risking much to go in. We toured the palace and grounds on our own. The replica buildings are magnificent and ornate but there is inadequate description of the history and contextual setting of the buildings. Also you can look into many of the buildings but you cannot actually go inside. We did not engage a tour guide as we wanted the freedom and informality to explore on our own but there is generally inadequate information (plaques, descriptions) to really appreciate the grounds and the replica buildings. If you really want to appreciate the site a tour guide is needed. There are some ramps for handicap access but there are also many steps. This destination is a work in progress as a tourist attraction but at modest cost it is interesting for a short time."
5778,5.0,"We attempted three times to go to Gyeongbokgung palace. Let me save you time a little bit of headache...IT IS CLOSED ON TUESDAYS! The second time we tried to visit President Obama was there so we couldn't go into the palace.  The third time we finally got to see everything. It's a large compound so wear comfortable shoes and bring a camera. If you have one with a good zoom lens it will come in handy, as you can't actually go into many of the buildings.  You can't miss this if you go to Seoul, the architecture is nothing you've ever seen. Breathtaking to see the details and colors used when everything was built. Buy a guide for 50 cents, it will give you information and a cheap souvenir to take with you. It's only a couple dollars for admission, worth it to walk the grounds. Don't miss the changing of the guard, the ceremony isn't very long but it's entertaining. You can take pictures with the guards on your way out."
5779,4.0,"This is the signature palace complex in Seoul with a myriad buildings in a range of smaller sections. There are many guided tours and at several specific times you can watch a colourful changing of the guard.  The best by far is the picturesque little pavilion on the lake at the very end of the palatial complex: you may recognise it from many popular photos of Korea. This is the most beautiful and tranquil spot in the whole complex with most sight-seers running out of steam long before they get there, so you can enjoy it almost as if it's your own."
5780,4.0,"This palace is huge, We entered it from the back door the one facing the President's Blue house. The garden was breathtaking, The museum was so-so. It is well worth the entrance fee, because there are just too much to see. be sure to watch the guard changing ceremony that take place at 10 am at the main entrance. I think it last for about half an hour or so. There are so many palaces in Seoul, but this one is the probably the most visited and most beautiful."
5781,5.0,"It was the first palace that I visited in korea I went on winter, so everything was covered in snow, was so pretty! I will try to go on spring when the flower blossom! It´s worth going! If you don´t have time you can visit only this palace."
5782,4.0,"Make sure you have sun protection because most of the areas in eh palace is not covered  We had a free tour guide, one of the Korean high school students so it was great to learn a lot of the history and culture of the palace. There was a big sign outside the train station for free tour guides which we did not regret.  We only spent about 1.5 hours here and that was enough"
5783,4.0,"I will totally want to go back again next time, with a guided tour and 3 hours to spare. The whole palace is huge and not exploring all the corners are a waste imo. I just spent an hour to realise that I am only at one section of the palace! Its a total regret that I did not allocate enough time for this visit. However I learnt a lot during that short hour. The palace is worth visiting! Would advise to hire a guide to learn more about the place."
5784,3.0,"Nice manicured grounds with plenty if nice photo opportunities. If you come expecting to see anything original, you will be sorely dissapointed. Almost all the buildings were built in 1999 onwards as the originals were destroyed long ago. The buildings outside the palace grounds that house your Macdonalds is likely older."
5785,4.0,"I visited Gyeongbokgung in November of 2010 and May of 2014. In 2010, I visited the palace as part of a tour and this year I had the opportunity to visit again, but at night (the palace is only opened at night during certain times of the year). Both experiences were great, just completely different. In 2010, the tour was a great opportunity to see so much of the palace grounds, plus the Folk Museum and learn a lot of history along the way. Our time in the palace this year was much shorter (simply based on our schedule), however it was amazing to see the palace transform as the sun set. Whether you have a few hours or maybe just 30 minutues, Gyeongbokgung is definitely worth a visit."
5786,5.0,"I had a 11 hour stop over in Seoul, South Korea. I took a 5 hours guided tour of Seoul during this time from the airport. This tour just cost $50. This included a traditional lunch in Seoul. I would surely recommend this tour if you are having a stop over.  The Royal Palace of Seoul was part of the tour. For a history buff like me, it was a walk through history. Is is the biggest of the Grand Palaces. First constructed in 1395, later burned and abandoned for almost three centuries, and then reconstructed in 1867. Most of the palace is well preserved. And some parts have been beautifully reconstructed.  It is a huge and beautiful complex in the heart of the city. So if you wish to really understand and enjoy the historical significance of the place you will need a minimum of 2-3 hours.  I suggest you get a guided tour so that someone can explain the significance of each building and architecture there.  Hope you get an opportunity to visit this magnificent and historical site."
5787,3.0,I visited this palace as part of a day tour of Seoul so we had our own guide. That was helpful for providing extra information about the different areas of the palace. I am not sure if there is a brochure in english available here like at other palaces. At other places it was 500 won.  This palace is nice. The grounds are well kept. The buildings are in good shape but they are also not very old. This palace was rebuilt after being destroyed by the Japanese. I did not find this palace as interesting as Changdeokgung. I think the buildings are very similar but the secret garden at Changeokgung makes it the more beautiful option.
5788,5.0,"This palace ( ₩3,000) with the Folk Museum within (free entrance) gives you great insight into the Korean culture. The grounds are big so prepare to walk a bit. It is beautiful and has a scenic view of both the mountains and the downtown of Seoul!"
5789,5.0,"I mean the palace from the drama comes to life :P A heavenly, peaceful place to tour with your friends, loves or families. Its soo huge that you need at least 2-3 hrs to tour every nook and cranny. The view is magnificent, beautiful lakes & temples, huge gardens with nice grass patch to lay on to relax under the cooling weather. Its gives a enchanted feeling of how royals, courts, servants etc used to lived. Guided tour will let you understand the stories of every path you walk, every temples you see. I miss out the museum that shows the history of Koreans back in the traditional era & the joseon dynasty tales so gotta be there early in order to explore all the places."
5790,4.0,"The Royal Palace is situated in the heart of Seoul, South Korea and it is accessible by subway. It occupies an area of almost 700 thousand square metres and was built in the Joseon Dynasty back in 1395. It was destroyed two times over the years because of foreign invasion and occupation and has been rebuilt and restored by 2010. The Korean name of the Palace means "" Palace greatly blessed by Heaven"" and it was inhabited by the Royal family. The Palace compound is huge and is composed of many different structures for various purposes. I was most impressed with the Geunjeongjeon (throne hall) near the entrance where officials of different ranks would queue up along two lines of stone markers on the left and right of the open court signifying seniority during ceremonies, declarations and audience with the King. Attraction number 4, Gangnyeongjeon and Gyotaejeon, i.e. King's and Queen's quarter as well as number 12, Gyeonghoeru, a two storey pavilion sitting on a pond for royal banquets and entertainment are also worth checking out. I was extremely lucky because when I arrived at the main gate, there was a change of guards in traditional and brightly coloured uniforms which added a touch of humanity to the solemn structures behind the walls. I was told it was done on the hour during the day. The temperature during my visit was -7 degrees centigrade and as it is a vast span of land with lots of open space, make sure you wear enough warm clothings. It may be a better idea though to visit at warmer times. Please note that the Palace also closes for one day during the week, so check with your hotel before you make your trip."
5791,3.0,"If you have been to Forbidden City in Beijing, you will see the familiarities of these palaces and I was not in awe with Gyeongbokgung as I have visited some nice palaces in Asia. There is almost no tree in the inner court and it's really hot after a long walk, even though I visited in early May. Unless you are into history or culture, don't expect great scenery such as beautiful Chinese garden there."
5792,5.0,"If you wanna know more about South Korea's culture, you should go here. It has temples, garden and a lot more about the country's origins. It is very huge that you need at least two hours to explore the place. I think it also has guided tours that could help you understand each location in this palace."
5793,4.0,"Before going, make sure the palace is open. We were there on a Tuesday but it was closed! The palace is in the midst of the modern Seoul, which makes it more interesting. It covers a large area (I don't know how many acres of land) and consists of a number of palaces. There is even a lake inside which adds to the serenity of the surrounding in spite of lots of visitors. The changing of guards is worth watching. The whole parade is about 10 minutes or a bit more. If you are not with a tour, get on the subway and get off at the palace station, the decoration inside the station is very unique. Besides the palace, there is also the museum where you can see interesting things too."
5794,4.0,We visited the palace in the night when it opens up for visitors for two weeks in spring. It was quite a unique experience and very beautiful. Call the tourist helpline to book the tickets for foreigners. The palace walkways are stony so the ride on the stroller would be bumpy for the baby however there are ramps in most places with steps. There is a small cafe in the premises so good place to eat and relax. The complex itself us not very big so easy to cover in two hours at a very relaxed pace. The ticket cost is KRW 3000. Very accessible by public transport
5795,5.0,"The building is very authentic. Two thumbs up for the maintanance effort. Even it's an old bulding but the cleaness is maintain very well. Try use hanbok in here, you'll love see yourself in Korean traditional clothes. For Korean Drama lovers, don't forget to visit the park behind Gyeongbokgung palace. Drama ""Rooftop Prince"" took a crucial and popular scene in that park."
5796,4.0,Highlight of our visit is the free trial of old Korean costumes and the photo opportunity. Located within the city proper and near a train station so this should be a stop for every visitor. They also have some guards parade at specific periods but they are not really elaborate events. there is a section of the palace where you have to pay but we chose not to enter.
5797,4.0,Located on the exact heart of Seoul. You dont have to go inside to fully enjoy the atmosphere. Theres two free museum (palace museum and folk museum) and the sidewalk around the palace is connectec to the presidential bluehouse. Westville and Northville are unique and hip neighborhood adjacent to the palace. On sundays farmers market and flea market opens right in front of thr palace.
5798,5.0,"We planned our visit around the time of the ""Changing of the Guard"" ceremony at 10am. We arrived about 15 minutes before to get a good spot. It is very colourful and quite spectacular and lasts about 20mins. Following the ceremony we purchased our ticket to enter to palace grounds. There are free English tours however we walked on our own. The grounds are magical. It is wonderful to see a royal palace over 700 years old. We entered from Gwanghwanun Square and continued up to the The National Folk Museum (which is free to enter). It is possible to exit near the museum and then walk to Bukchon Hanok Village. This palace is a must to see!"
5799,3.0,"Not too bad, the place is huge and packed with lots of tourists. Yet another touristic spots. Nothing special about it. You may want to walk further down to Insadong street."
5800,5.0,"I visited this palace on a Saturday. If you come early, it is not so crowded. I entered via the east gate from Samcheongdong-gil, after a tour of the cute little area Bukchon, where ticket lines are far shorter and you get a prior glimpse at the National Folklore Museum ;) The gardens are just beautiful, as are the colorful buildings and a little pavillion in the middle of a little pond with a bridge leading to it. Although large parts of the Palace buildings were destroyed it is great to get an impression how the buildings looked in their former glory. Descriptions of various buildings and palace complexes are also in English, so it is very tourist friendly. Overall, a very nice palace, and after having seen both this and Changdeokgung Palace, I would recommend a visit to this palace more. And if you get lucky, you can see the guard change at Gwanghwamun main gate, which is very worth it with their colorful flags and costumes!"
5801,3.0,Buildings not as intricate or beautiful and grand as those in china. The Gardens blooming in spring were well maintained and enhance the otherwise unspectacular architecture. The guards at the entrance in bright red and blue and yellow were good for colorful photography. As structures have been rebuild and renovated from its original it appears too modern and artificial.
5802,4.0,"The guard changes at 10, 11, 1,2,3 and 4. There are two different ceremonies. Interesting to see. Buildings were interesting. The country has such history and it is amazing to see this, in the middle of the city. Very easy to access from the Seoul Metro. The directions say 5 mins to walk from subway, but that may be from the platform. Once you get out of the station, you are there. Reasonable cost for admission. The ground can be uneven due to the large stones. Can be difficult with a stroller or wheelchair, if you are planning to go there."
5803,5.0,Bring your camera and spend a few hours walking around the different buildings and parks. It can be crowded but worth a visit.
5804,4.0,"I would first see the Changdeokgung Palace. The palace looks almost similar but this is the main palace and you just must see it. If you've taken the English tour in Changdeokgung Palace, you could skip it here. There are museums inside, which had good reviews. We just didn't have time to visit them."
5805,4.0,"This is the first place I visited the moment I dropped off my bags at my hotel in Myeongdong. I was here quite early on a Sunday morning and coming out of the subway exit seeing the Palace museum and even just the rooftops of Gyeongbokgung palace with sunrise behind it was already enough to make me feel I am really in Seoul. The gates open at 9am and if you are planning to visit other palaces just buy the palace pack which costs around KW10,000($10) and this includes the tour of the secret garden in Changdeokgung palace which is another UNESCO heritage site. Take note of the scheduled openings because they are closed on Mondays so you have to plan which palace to visit on certain days. As you enter the main gate (Gwanghwamun gate) look up and see the colorful artistry painted on the ceiling of this entry and beyond this gate it is a majestic site. The admission office is located at the right side after you enter the main gate and where you can also get a tourist map of Seoul. They have scheduled tours depending on your language and there are small buidings on each side where you can sign up and garb up in hanbok or guard costumes and have your picture taken. They have posted times for this too so if you get the chance sign up for the block of time and see what you look like in Joseon garb. It took me around 2-3 hours and make sure you take a picture of the Gyeongheoru pavilion its on the west side of the palace where the king supposedly entertained foreign dignitaries and diplomats. It is very picturesque and set in a lake with mountains as your background. There was a lot of people but the gounds are vast that you won't feel claustrophobic. Don't forget to visit the National Folk museum and the childrens museum at the rear of the palace. Entry to the museum is free but I rented an audio guide to get a little bit more information on the displays, which cost me around $1."
5806,4.0,"If there was only one palace you visit in Seoul, make sure it is Gyeongbokgung. Well maintained and on extensive grounds, you'll also see many other gates, halls and paviions. Time your visit so you can see the Sumunjang (Royal Guard) Changing Ceremony at 10:00, 13:00, 15:00 (20 minutes). If you go at 11:00, 14:00 and 16:00 you'll see a shorter 10 minute 'Gate Guard Duty' ceremony."
5807,5.0,"All the guidebooks to Seoul will tell you that Gyeongbokgung is a must see, and this is absolutely true. The history of this palace is covered extensively elsewhere, and all the practical information required is in the excellent KTO page http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=264337  We bought an Integrated Ticket of Palaces which covers Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung, Gyeongbokgung and Jongmyo Shrine. This was excellent value at 10,000 won.  It was lovely wandering around Gyeongbokgung by ourselves but our visit would have been enhanced had we joined an English speaking tour, so time your visit for one of these groups. There are seats by the lake in the middle, so it is perfectly possible to bring a picnic and enjoy the visit at a leisurely pace - most of the visitors are either in large tour groups or school children on a history outing. This means that the palace is always busy; however there is no reason, if you are an independent traveller, to rush around and not appreciate the beauty of the whole compound, including the National Folk Museum.  If time permits, it is best to spend the whole day in this area as Insadong and Bukchon are close by, with its art galleries and independent craft shops. This is Seoul at its historical and cultural best and it would be a shame to factor in Gyeongbokgung as simply one more thing to cross off your Seoul 'to do' list."
5808,5.0,"Quite a mouthful to pronounce, Gyeongbokgung actually means ""greatly blessed by heaven palace"". Originally built in the 14th century, most of the buildings were destroyed over time but have now been faithfully reconstructed. Apparently some of the original buildings still exist. If you only have a day or two in Seoul make sure you visit this palace. The magnificent Gwanghwamun entrance gate overlooks a major square which is also worth visiting. The buildings take you back in time to the Joseon Dynasty and, if you're really into these kind of palaces, I suggest you take as much time as you like. We felt a couple of hours was enough for us but enjoyed roaming around and taking in the historic atmosphere which contrasted nicely with modern day Seoul. Better to get there as early as possible to avoid the crowds although make sure you see the changing of the guard. This colourful reenactment takes place 3 times a day, between 10 a.m and 3 p.m, and is well worth watching. The guards are dressed in royal uniforms and carry traditional weapons and musical instruments. For a moment you feel you are actually living in the 14th century."
5809,5.0,"Only know two palaces in Seoul that is popular, Gyeongbokgung and Changdokgeung. When I went over, bumped into a lot of local students who were on study trip, so it's very crowded. Changing guard ceremony is quite a moment to see. After that you can take a photo shoot with the guard in front of the gate Gwanghaemun. It is the top tourist destination too. Easily reach by subway orange color."
5810,4.0,Had a nice walk in the palace and also visiting the folk museum just outside the actual palace compound.  Had a great lunch too in a traditional house in the district just east of the compound.
5811,4.0,"Surround by many visitor mainly from main land, the palace was well maintain and is looks totally Gorgeous to me. All the scene in Korea Historical drama come in live, and the feel just amazing ."
5812,4.0,"All of it is worth to visit, you will experience new cultures and histories of South Korea. It is very unique and beautiful"
5813,4.0,"If you have limited time in Seoul, I would recommend seeing this palace. Once you exit the subway exit, the palace is right in front of you. However, after a couple of minutes, things start looking the same. There are different buildings that you cannot enter. There is a history museum in the middle of the palace that is very well done; like Smithsonian type exhibits."
5814,5.0,All of them are well worth the visit Gives some idea of the longevity and uniqueness of the womderful Korean people and culture
5815,4.0,Not sure if it will be every Sunday that they have the changing of guards as it will be boring if you goes there without any 'show' or even a tour guide to guide you along. We were greeted by a teacher before we reached the palace. She had offered her student to bring us around the palace for a tour as part of the boy's curriculum. The cute Korean boy was indeed very good and speaks very good English. Entrance to the palace = Won 3000 only.  I enjoyed very much on every corner of this palace and after knowing the history behind it. I happened to be there during the cherry blossom and it was indeed very beautiful seeing the blooming flowers.
5816,4.0,This is a huge palace complex where the buildings do tend to look like one another. The changing of the guard ceremony was precision marching at its best. The costumes were very elaborate.
5817,4.0,"Schedule your visit during the changing of the guards as it makes the trip more worth it. The palace is huge and it gets tiring to look at the royal rooms after quite some time. Still, you should go and be amazed that this piece of tradition is smacked right in the center of a busy metro."
5818,5.0,"This place was amazing and quite large (area wise). We took the subway from Sangsu Station (Hongdae) to Gyeongbokgung Station which is right near the palace. Make sure you take exit 5 when leaving the subway station. The palace sits right behind Gwanghwamun Square which makes for a great photo op. We arrived the gate, and the first thing we stumbled upon was the changing of the guards which was pretty cool. You can take pictures with the guards to when they are stationary!  Once we stopped posing with the guards, we entered the courtyard and headed toward the ticket counter. The price was really cheap (3,000 KRW = Approx 3 USD). We walked the grounds in it's entirety and was amazed by the detail and the scale of this complex. The cool thing is, if you look toward the mountain, you feel like you're actually in a time warp in the 1300's as their is no modern skyline.  Finally, this is a one/two punch if you were to take advantage of it as the National Folk Museum of Korea is around the back of this complex. All in all, that is one of the few places where it is cool to go multiple times."
5819,5.0,"Great place to spend 1-2 hours roaming around in this beautiful palace. Do catch the guards changing ceremony (earliest at 10am). This place offers many spots for nice photos! Gyeongbokgung Palace Station (Seoul Subway Line 3), Exit 5."
5820,4.0,"We didn't do all the palaces of Seoul, but if you are going to do one of them it should be this one. Not on the scale of Forbidden City in Beijing, but still very impressive.  Again very cheap entry fee, free 1 hour tour guides in different languages which was very informative, and the changing of the guard which is definitely worth the wait (many of these throughout the day) and great for photo ops with historical dressed soldiers.  Next to this are 2 museums (Folk and the Palace museum). Both are interesting and depends if you have time in your schedule. Folk is included in Palace ticket."
5821,4.0,"The grandest of all five palaces in Seoul. Remember to take brochure near the entrance. There is free guided tour (in english, japanese, chinese) but the chinese speaking guide that we followed was too soft speaking, barely could hear what she said even she spoke with amplifier, so i suggest to walk on your own with a brochure. Sad that i was too engrossed walking around taking pictures & forgot to refer back to the brochure for understanding the details of the palace.  Things to do: 1. Try hanbok for free. Need to register & wait for your turn. Closed during lunch hour. Can try posing & taking pictures with the guards wearing hanbok. 2. Watch the guards changing ceremony every hour from 10am-4pm. All the guards are really tall & fit. So funny that my nephew was so intimidated by the guards that he asked me to carry him haha."
5822,5.0,"Very interesting place with many things to see. To hire a guide would not be a bad idea, otherwise one can read all in the travel guide."
5823,4.0,"Having just visited Gyeongbokgung while on a short holiday break in Seoul last week, I would say its a worthwhile visit historically.  The entire infrastructure and size is comparable to Beijing's Forbidden Palace, though internally, many of the rooms are similar after a while. I have always have an interest in Korean historical artefacts, so while internally, it is not as elaborate in terms of design and ornaments decoration, the feel of how the royal palace was like in its heydays is still pretty interesting. Like all huge palaces, there are a labyrinth of the walkways, and it is easy to get lost if you are not following a map of the place.  Be prepared for an average of 3 hours exploratory walk, if you are intending to cover the entire area.  While there, be sure to visit the National Arts Museum, and the National Palace Musuem. A visit to both, together with the palace, gives a very good insight to the lifestyle of Korea during the Joseon dynasty period."
5824,4.0,"The first place I visited during my trip to Korea. Nice palace and definitely a must-visit in Korea. Too bad that I went during rainy day. The weather is so cold and the ground is a little bit muddy and we need to find a shelter inside a coffee shop to warm ourselves up.  We missed out the guards changing ceremony as we were late. Anyway, we still able to see the guards changing their position and marching a little, not too shabby."
5825,4.0,"If you are a first time visitor in Seoul, then it's a must see. they have guard change every hour. the whole complex is huge so get about 3 hours in there...you can also visit the Korean folk museum, national palace museum, and blue house (presidential office) right next to it."
5826,5.0,"A true exmple of Korean spirit of persistance, perseverance and art.  Huge wooden structures.....nicely decorated place yet exhibiting simplycity of Korean Emperors.  They keep organising cutural shows there dipicting ancient traditions and stories as well. Which makes it a must go attraction in seoul.  Nicely Managed place.......be ready to walk a long stretch to cover every part of it."
5827,4.0,Access to this palace was very easy - just get off at the Gyeongbokgung subway station exit and its big entrance is right there. The palace structures were huge and the grounds were expansive. I particularly liked a spot near a small temple surrounded by water with swans. I can sit there for hours just taking the beauty of the whole place all in.
5828,5.0,A must-see if you into history or culture. We visited in the morning and joined one of the few guided tours in English. Come here if you wish to learn about history and view the palace and ancient artifacts  Tips: The English tours are limited to a few timings per day so do plan ahead.  The palace is a 10-15 min walk from the train station. You can't see it from the station but it is not difficult to find your way there.
5829,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung, the ""Palace Greatly Blessed by Heaven"" is one of the ""must visit"" attractions in Seoul. It is centrally located in the heart of Seoul and can be covered in half a day with the nearby Gwanghwamun Square, Admiral Yi Sun Shin Monument, King Sejong Memorial Hall and the Cheonggyecheon Stream.  The nearest subway is the Gyeongbokgung Station at exit 5. We didn't use the subway. We were at Insadong, and we walked for about 10 minutes from Ssamji-gil and arrived at the Gwanghwamun Gate around 2:50 pm.  At the time of our arrival, there is no ""Changing of the Guards Ceremony"". We were not disappointed because the tall Imperial Guards standing at the arched gateway in their costumes make awesome photos. Admission tickets at 3,000won each are purchased inside the grounds and you can photograph these guards or watch the changing ceremonies at the Gwanghwamun Gate for free without purchasing admission tickets.  Free guided tour starts at the reception office inside Heungnyemun Gate. English tours are at 11.00am, 1.30pm and 3.30pm. Groups of 10 to 30 people require reservation. It is advisable to use a guide otherwise you'll be walking around and snapping pictures without a clue of what you are looking or photographing at.  The Gyeongbokgung Palace has some Chinese architectural influence and it reminded us of the Forbidden City in Beijing. There are some cherry blossoms here and it was said that the Japanese, during their occupation, had planted some of the trees on sacred and offensive locations within the palace ground. After the occupation, these offending trees were destroyed. But today, the remaining cherry blossoms add a softer touch to the Palace and provide a lovely landscape.  Gyeongbokgung Palace is a huge complex consisting of many areas, pavilions, ponds, halls, chambers and gates and will need about 2 to 3 hours of your time. The hexagonal Hyangwonjeong Pavilion looks impressive and it was a pity they barricaded the bridge to prevent entry. It could only be admired from across the pond. Hyangwonjeong Pavilion will look best during autumn.  Lockers are available and smoking is not allowed anywhere in the palace area, except at designated sites.  Date of visit: 19 April, 2013 Season: Spring Temperature: 12°C"
5830,4.0,"We only went to one palace and we chose Gyeongbokgung cos the reviews said that this was the most majestic :) We went early, just before 0900hrs. Taxis will drop you by the side entrance, but do walk to the front (Gwanghwamun Gate) for the changing of guards. There's a few museums within the area, the National Folk Museum which we went to and the palace itself was pretty interesting. For those who like architecture, its pretty great :)"
5831,5.0,"This is one of the bigger palaces in Seoul. One could easily spend 2-3 hours walking around. They have Guided tours every couple of hours till about 3:30pm. If you miss this, definitely get an audio guide, it could get a bit confusing without one. Changing of Guards ceremony happens 10 - 3pm every couple of hours, dont miss it! The National Folk Museum located inside is a must visit if you are interested in knowing a bit more about their History, Culture & Traditions."
5832,4.0,This Korean architecture of this expansive palace contrasts markedly with the contemporary Seoul skyscrapers. One highlight is the hourly changing of the guard parade. There's an English tour conducted periodically which is essential if you want to understand what the place is all about. I believe they also have an audio tour available as an alternative. Well worth seeing to get a flavor of Korean history and culture. There were surprisingly few westerners there when we visited.
5833,5.0,"Superb architecture. Very interesting mix of buildings, gardens and temples. It has a good restaurant and is just besides a metro station."
5834,5.0,"Very attractive place and of course it's one of the list of a must go in Seoul. Easy to reach and sparkling place to visit. Very helpful staff and nice people too. Don't know why I saw so many Thai people, even wonder if I were in the wrong country. I like the soldiers in the fancy old style clothes just like in the dramas. Good for all generations!"
5835,3.0,"It was supposed to be grand but despite the vastness and a couple of displays of the old settings of the palace, I came away without feeling impressed. It did cross my mind what a big place for the workers to get from place to place in the compound."
5836,5.0,"Arrived there at 10AM and caught the Changing of the Guards. There is even a small free brochure, in English, about this event. At 11AM there was the English tour. This really added interest with the new perspective on the Palace and its place in Korean history. Well worth the trip."
5837,4.0,It was my first time in Seoul so I definitely wanted to see one of the palaces. Gyeongbokgung was beautiful and the weather was superb. We happened upon free entry on May 4th. It was great to walk around and there were actually quite a few girls in traditional costume and they were wonderful to see against the historical backdrop. I also recommend visiting the National Folk Museum next to the palace grounds.
5838,5.0,the grandeur and size make it impressive. you may try traditional clothes for free but you must line up for your turn. well worth it.
5839,5.0,"This was a great spot to visit! The grounds were so beautiful and we really enjoy seeing the old buildings and palace. There is a large pond and even an exhibit of the large jars they would use to ferment food in for feasts. There is not air conditioning in many of the buildings, so summer time can be hot - bring water! If you go at the right time of day you can also see the ceremonial changing of the guard that was really interesting! One of the neatest things is that the entire site is located in the middle of the city so you can see sky scrapers right past the palace!"
5840,4.0,Time tour visit at main south entrance for one of the 4 daily guard changing inv ceremonies--- fun to see.
5841,5.0,The area is immaculately preserved. They also make it so tourist friendly with the free Hanbok wearing and the changing of the guards ceremony for show.
5842,4.0,"If you are just going to Seoul for shopping, I'll say you may not like going to these historical places which can be a little dry.  But it's highly recommended especially for 1st time visitors to take some time off to read, see and learn how is the history like and how much hv been destroyed after the war. Take your time to stroll the gardens to take the city stress away. Try on the guards uniform for a fun photo taking at no costs.  Every country's historical buildings are to be respected for what they have been through with time. So we think its not a fair comparison to compare the different palaces. Just have an open mind to learn more of what was recorded during that era."
5843,3.0,reminder of how imperialism - in this case Japanese tried to destroy the local narrative. Nice walk but ...
5844,4.0,"Korea is a place deeply entrenched in history. In Seoul, this main royal palace is part of that legacy. For a first time visitor in Seoul, I was awed by the magnificence of this grand place. I witnessed the changing of the guards which is a colorful ceremony and had a guided walk exploring the ceremonial hall, the king and queen quarters, the palace office and the peaceful garden by the lakeside. Upon exiting the palace, you will find the current Presidential Headquarters together with a museum which showcases Korea's culture and history."
5845,3.0,I didn't find this as interesting as Changdeokgung palace but it is different. Catch the changing of the guards if you can and on a nice day it is very pleasant to wander around the building complex and the grounds.
5846,3.0,The Palace was closed when I went on 30 April (not sure why) but it did look impressive from the outside.
5847,4.0,"I visited this and Changdeokgung palace. It's different. Although I prefer the Forbidden City in Beijing, palaces in South Korea is different in architecture and layouts. The garden is beautiful.  Only went into Chandgeokgung palace. Skipped the secret garden as it was raining and didn't think I will get to appreciate the beauty of the garden (not that I know) without the sun!"
5848,4.0,"A wonderful experience walking around the palace grounds, the National Palace museum is located right beside the palace representing the majesty of the 500 year history of the Joseon Dynasty."
5849,5.0,English tour guide was excellent. The cherry trees had just started to bloom so the visitors from all nations and the native Koreans seemed to be more interested in the trees than the buildings.
5850,4.0,Make sure you do not miss the exchange of guards which start around 10am. It is almost an hour show and worth watching. Take note that this takes place outside Gyeongbokgung and you need not purchase a ticket to watch this!
5851,4.0,Would have been even prettier if the cherry blossom trees had bloomed :( Very well kept and clean. The paint on the palace roof is still very vibrant.
5852,4.0,"This palace stands out at a main intersection. If you've already been to another of the big palaces like Changdeokgung, as I had, then it will look familiar. Nevertheless, they have a changing of the guard every 2 hours or so, which is very colourful and makes a good photographic opportunity especially on a bright sunny day. It's worth a look. Take note that it is closed on Tuesdays."
5853,4.0,"with a very good guide, one can learn a lot from this place. loved the ""changing of guards"" ceremony with actor-guards in complete costumes."
5854,5.0,"This palace is a ""must see"" for any trip to Seoul. The surroundings are absolutely beautiful with mountains in the background, manicured gardens and fish ponds. You can experience how the royal family used to live hundreds of years ago and then step out the gate into downtoen Seoul. Walking shoes a good idea due to the large area to be covered and the uneven surface area (ancient paving stones, not concrete). The changing of the guard ceremony also interesting as well as the exhibits of life in ancient Korea."
5855,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung is definitely a must visit tourist attraction when you're in Seoul. It's at the heart of Seoul and lets you experience the history of how life was like for South Koreans. The architecture of the buildings are amazingly beautiful. There are performances at the grand entrance, tours in different languages for free and it costs less than $3 to the admission fee. This place is definitely huge so make sure to wear walking shoes."
5856,5.0,"We were here a few years ago. The palace is really cool! We loved learning about the history and all the detail in the architecture. The guard ceremony was neat also. they have headsets to describe everything you are seeing. However, not long after we got there we met a teenage girl that wanted to practice her english so we let her be our tour guide! Loved this place, a great experience!"
5857,4.0,"There are a couple of palaces in Seoul. Both are different enough to enjoy separately, but you must see at least one."
5858,5.0,"Gyungbok Palace was used as a King's place during Joseon dynasty. You can feel Korean royal family's life and there living standard. Also, you can enjoy beautiful nature in Gyungbok Palace. Don't forget other palaces around Gyungbok Palace like Changduk Palace or Changgyung Palace."
5859,5.0,The changing of the guard that happens at 10am is free and was pretty cool to see. You need to pay 3000 won to get in to see the rest of the site but it is worth it.  The site is very big and you also get access to the folk museum
5860,5.0,"one of my favourite destinations in seoul, this is a MUST SEE! how beautiful the grounds are here, and so serene and relaxing in the heart of this very very busy city. great for a picnic lunch, be sure to allow yourself a few hours here to just relax, wander around and enjoy this quiet. really really magical!"
5861,5.0,"Guide books advised us that the gate opening took place at 9am. This is incorrect. The gate opening takes place at 10am. You can catch them warming up at 9.45. It's worth watching though and try to get to the palace early to avoid the crowds. We got there for 9am and we got some lovely photos, tour groups start pouring in from about 9.30am. 11.30am is the first English tour."
5862,4.0,plenty of phoyo opportunities with guards changing and the buildings and you can try on a uniform and watz around its very funny and worth doing and as always everyone is friendly
5863,4.0,Prepare for a long walk if we want to explore the whole areas. The whole were very clean and well-maintained. The palaces have colorful detail and interesting pattern on many parts of them.
5864,4.0,"We visited the palace as a family on a Sunday morning and spent appr 2 hours here. As has been mentioned in many reviews, a lot of parts of this palace are rebuilt due to destruction suffered during Japanese occupation. Nevertheless, it remains very impressive. Since we had our two children with us (10 and 15) we didn't opt for any tours (they tend to get bored easily) but just wandered around the grounds. There were plenty of information tablets near all major sites and all were available in English so no language barrier there. We arrived at appr. 10.50 and were able to take some shots of the kids with the colourful guards in front of the palace. The changing of the guards on the hour made for a lovely video shot. Once inside the gate the ticket booths were located towards the right hand side. When we went in there were only 2-3 people queuing in front of us so no delays in purchasing tickets. The grounds are huge so you can easily spend some hours just wandering about, taking scenic shots (and have them taken by Koreans of you as well!). We had a coffee outside the cafe in the sun which was lovely and priced similarly to the rest of Seoul. Overall a great place to start your sightseeing. Very easy to do and beautiful shots to get. I would make sure you go in good weather though since virtually all of it is outside (you will only be able to look inside the buildings from windows)."
5865,5.0,"Due to the destruction of much of their heritage during several periods of Japanese occupation, Koreans are in many cases literally rebuilding their history. So many (parts) of their old temples and palaces seem a bit 'new'. Having said that, Gyeongbokgung was a lovely place to visit and see part of their architecture and heritage."
5866,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the many attractions in Seoul. The place presents a vivid view of the life of South Korean royalty during the olden days. It is easy to get around the palace grounds because of multi-lingual signage all over the area (English, Korean, Japanese). There is also an audio tour provided to visitors who want to avail of it. The palace grounds is so vast. It has certain similarities with Chinese architecture.  To get to Gyeongbokgung, you can take the subway or the bus. You can also take the Seoul City Tour Bus which has its last stop at Gyeongbokgung."
5867,5.0,We visited this Palace on our first day in Seoul. It was the perfect introduction to Korea and antidote to jetlag. We walked for about three hours..you can spend even more time there. Bring water and snacks. Take time to rest and enjoy the beautiful lake .
5868,4.0,"The palace was not too big, 2 hour was enough to spend there. The things I like from this palace was, there were Hanbook rent for free, beside the cafeteria. But had to queue, since many local and tourist used this facility."
5869,4.0,"Wow ... What a great piece of architecture ad restoration. This palace is the largest and one of 5 palaces in Seoul. I joined a tour and this was one of the inclusions.  It was good to have someone explain all the history and show me through. Wonderful colors and history.  Look out for the changing of the guards - a parade of wonderful costumes, sounds and pagentary. Lots of people scrambling to get photos but wait until the end and you will get shots of guards leaving .  I wish I had more time as tour only allocated an hour which also include the national folk museum. This is a must see if you have limited time. The other palace I saw was very similar ad I don't think it's worth doing two palaces."
5870,5.0,"Just use a jacket, long john, and sneakers, and ... you are ready to enjoy Gyeongbokgung Palace in winter. It may provide a slight different experience when we visited Gyeongbokgung Palace in the thickest snow in Seoul history in 2010. It was a little bit chilly, however, it was wonderful seeing the guards hand over ceremony. Do not forget to take pictures by wearing traditional guard costumes for free - a brilliant opportunity."
5871,4.0,"It was amazing to see how totality lived... And there day to day habits. The architecture is a sight to behold. I was amazing to see how Japan and chime ha influence in the way they developed there land and also to know that korea has been invaded by both but still in the end Korea fought through. Even if your not big into history the views, plant life, and entertainment is enough to take up your whole day. Don't forget to see the changing of the guards. And for 3,000 won you can't beat that... Plus free admittance to the national folk museum right next door."
5872,4.0,"I liked the fact that this complex was restored very well. Though it suffered a lot of damages due to the war and the Japanese occupation, I found this royal palace to be a more sober and enjoyable example compared to Beijing's Forbiddne City. More information available in english, less crowded, and very clean"
5873,5.0,This palace is spread over a huge distance.There are lots of buildings are beautiful. This is palace is worth seeing. On buying the entrance ticket we were given a map and an English guide. This was good as it allowed us to walk around the grounds at our leisure. the only problem is that my map reading skills are nil. It was quite cold when I went there but I can imagine this place would be amazing with blossoms.  It ia worth seeing.
5874,5.0,"Definitely recommend this. See the changing of the guard, and they also do a little performance every hour. Recommend getting a tour. Its much more interesting as you hear about the kings and queens who lived in korea back in the days."
5875,5.0,Great Place to be. Wonderful seeing the guards hand over ceremony in the morning. The views inside are great. Guided tours In Englishare even more fascinating. Dont miss the photo spot near the ponds inside.
5876,2.0,"Nothing exciting.  Its ok but not a match for other parts of Seoul, dont go out your way to go.  Kids were bored inside 5 munutes."
5877,4.0,"Its a very interesting place to visit. Especially if you get there to see the changing of the guards. It shoows you the historical way of the past, and afterwards you are allow to take pictures with the guards once they are in position at their post. I wish I could have seen it in the summer time when the trees and flowers would be at full bloosom."
5878,4.0,"A huge and impressive palace complex, which does bear some comparison to both the style and layout of Beijing's Forbidden City. The front gate guards change every hour on the hour, and offer a colourful photo opportunity. Line 3 to Gyeongbokgung, and exit 5 to the front gate."
5879,5.0,"Well kept, vibrant and well preserved. You will enjoy an afternoon stroll here and definitely enjoy visiting the museums. Nice souvenirs and reasonably priced. They have great views to take pictures of and is one of the palaces that you would think of revising."
5880,5.0,"My boyfriend and I came here after the one hour tour at Changdeokgung in the huge park east of here. We decided to stop in before lunch as the site is smaller on the map. Poor planning! This place is HUGE and has so much stuff inside! You really need to set aside a lot of time for this area! There are 3 museums in the area you can see (one is hidden under the statue of a man sitting on the street in front). After you check out the changing of the guards, you can check out tons of buildings on the inside. If you bring kids, this is definitely a full day! Luckily there is a variety of things here to do that keep it interesting. A must-see in Seoul!"
5881,5.0,"If you will like to visit only 1 palace, may I suggest this one. English guided tours run 3 times a day, please check for the times. Its especially useful to walk around with an english speaking guide, it breathes life to the place.  The palace grounds is the largest amongst the other palaces in Seoul. The spaces is majestic and grand. Located next to the Gyeongbukgung palace are a few museums, which is included in the ticket price of 3000won.  There are guards dressed in traditional costume at the gates. There is a guard change ceremony which makes the visit interesting."
5882,4.0,"i have visited this amazing place at my second day in Seoul and it was -6C but still i spent hours around... lucky me i saw the changing guards ceremony in the morning and went around with a local tour guide which helpful to understand every spots inside the palace its a huge complex, silent, clean (even icy everywhere) and brought me back to the past when i walked and sit silent inside the complex.. when i was there, i took many pictures and i just couldn't stop to do it... it a must place to visit when you are in Seoul and spend more time around... for sure i will be back here if i visit Seoul in other season (it was winter)"
5883,5.0,Our family love to visit museums and historical landmarks. This palace is a really nice place to learn about the traditions of the Koreans. It is well preserved and worth a visit.
5884,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung is one of the 5 grand palaces of Seoul and very rightly so. It was mostly destroyed by the Japanese after the Korea occupation and so far they have only been able to restore half the buildings! It occupies a large area close to downtown and can be easily reached by subway - just stop at the station with the same name (line3). One of the highlights is the changing of the guards which happens every hour. It also houses the National Folk Museum, a comprehensive guide to the soul of Korean people, including the history of the ever present Kimchi. You should not miss both."
5885,4.0,"Do drop by this area and view the palace. It's huge and a lot of historic moments that you able to experience. Around it, there are other palaces as well. If you have time, can visit all, else just choose this one and it's good enough to leave good memory :)"
5886,4.0,"This is probably the largest palace in Seoul. The vastness of the grounds is imposing and certain structures are really fascinating. The main attraction, though, would have to be the changing of the guards that happen at 10am. Be sure to see it, as there's nothing quite like it. You can take the guided tour or go around on your own. It's not very difficult to go around, and the maps indicate which are the notable landmarks to visit. I thought it was fascinating, but despite being so large, it somehow pales in comparison to Cheongbukdong. It's still something to see, though."
5887,3.0,"It was ok, nothing overally special I didn't think, but then I was by myself. I watched the changing of the guard and then looked around the palace, might have been more beneficial if you got a guide."
5888,5.0,"As a largest palace in South Korea, there are many different palaces within the palace to view and take photographs. There is even a pond right behind the King's concubines' quarters that has a pavilion in the centre.  The only thing I disliked about it was that I spent at least 3 hours exploring the palace, including the 2 museums within the palace."
5889,5.0,"Fantastic place so much to see and read about ,great help is the Guide book (in various languages ) Great place to spend the day ."
5890,3.0,"It's kind of interesting to walk around the Palace grounds and imagine what live was like, but every building looks the same because they've all be recently rebuilt. It kind of lacks the feel of a historic site. Feel free to just watch the changing of the guard ceremony and take a picture for a guard or two, but don't spend more than an hour here. There better things to see."
5891,5.0,"A major cultural and tourist attraction. Not to be missed, along with the Palace museum,which houses artifacts and gowns of the royal family ."
5892,5.0,"We arrived at 10am to see the changing of the guard ceremony which was really fun to see. Then we bought our tickets and waited for the start of the English tour. The grounds are massive, so allow enough time here. We only spent 30 minutes in the Folk Museum which was not nearly enough time, but we were in a hurry. I'm still amazed at how reasonable entrance fees are in Seoul--just three dollars US for this place. I highly recommend seeing this palace."
5893,5.0,This palace is located at the base of a mountain on one side and the busy city of seoul on the other. It is beautiful to see the traditional Palace surrounded by the modern Seoul of today. This palace is large and takes a while to walk all the way through but the buildings are beautiful and the history is interesting. We missed the tour so we took one of the information booklets and did a self guided tour and it was great. There is a lot of information given in the booklet. The tickets are inexpensive and the changing of the guard is narrated in 3 languages. Definitely a must do in Seoul!
5894,4.0,"The massiveness of the palace, the kings swimming pool, and the change of guards is also a wonderful sight."
5895,5.0,"This is the #1 palace to see if you can only see one. Highly recommend the tour. Only a few english tours a day, so check your guide book or the website for schedule. If you can't make the tour, pick up a pamphlet at the information office, there isn't any signage on the grounds explaining what anything is. Changing of the guard happens every hour on the hour, that's worth seeing. Also recommend the integrated palaces ticket if you plan to visit a lot of palaces. It's a good value and saves the standing in line at every palace to buy tickets."
5896,4.0,"This palace is very beautiful and huge. If you are a kdrama lover, you'll find some parts of the palace that is used to shoot some kdramas. It was winter when we visited Gyeongbokgung, so it was very cold. You can just wander around by yourself or guided by available tour guides there."
5897,4.0,"The National Folk Museum (in the grounds) is free. For those interested in Korean history and culture, it is a must. $3 to wander around the palace grounds is not bad value but adds little to your knowledge or understanding - it is merely a photo opportunity."
5898,5.0,It is old palace of traditional ear in Korea. Pretty beautyful and attractive place.
5899,5.0,"Definitely worth the visit. Best schedule is 3 pm changing of the guards with music and very choreographed procession, then quickly buy tickets and take the free guided tour in English. Our guide clearly loved that place /the guides are volunteers/ and even though she said it will be an hour, it was 1:40 overall. That gives you still a good hour until the closing time to soak up the atmosphere.it was quite damaged in the Japanese occupation, so they are rebuilding it, but its huge and not too crowded. A wonderful insight into the history of Chosen dynasty."
5900,4.0,On a very short visit to Seoul we visited the grounds of this palace and a couple of rooms. I wish we had more time and better guidance to the variety of things to know about this palace.
5901,4.0,Going to this palace end of february with a group tour. so we know about the history abaout this palace. What a nice palace.
5902,5.0,This is the second time we have visited this Palace just to watch the parade of soldiers who perform the Changing of the Guard. They are wearing colorful costumes and march around some of the area of the huge forecourt. There are many performances on the hour and some are short - 5 minutes or so- and some are 20 minutes in length with photo opportunities available.
5903,5.0,"It was my second time visiting the palace and I am still fascinated by the beauty of this place. I would always revisit Gyeongbokgung. On a little side note, I was once in October and the other time in February, I would recommend going in fall, because in winter it is freezing cold!!! and the ways are quite muddy."
5904,4.0,"Although most of the buildings are rebuilt in recent years, there are various guard changing ceremonies held throughout the day. at 11am 1pm and 3pm there is a procession with drums and music and at 2pm and 4pm is a simpler guard changing ceremony."
5905,5.0,"Very interesting, clean. A great place to see the history of Korea. Very beautiful grounds, well kept, not crowded."
5906,5.0,We learned a lot about the history of this palace and the effect that the poor relations with the Japanese has had on this treasure. Most of it has been rebuilt. Go on the hour when there is a changing of the guard.
5907,5.0,"It was only coincidental that we went during the eve of the Lunar New Year, but it was great that we did because we got to see some traditional performances outside the National Folk Museum just beside the palace grounds. We also got the chance to have a free photo-taking session dressed up in traditional Korean costumes. The palace and its grounds were also amazing, like you were in a Korean historical drama, and everything was covered with snow, so it was such a great scene to take in. We were also lucky enough to see the changing of the palace guards at Gwanghwamun. This is a must place to visit in Seoul!"
5908,4.0,"this is the also one of the ""must see"" place when you go on city tour, at front of Sejong King Statue, go on there at 10.00 then you will see the guard changing ceremony, and after that you can taken your picture with them, it was great,,,"
5909,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace or the Palace Greatly Blessed by Heaven was built in 1395 and consists of several buildings including a Throne Hall, residences of the Crown Prince, the Concubines and Court Ladies, a library, a pavilion in the middle of a (frozen) pond, all surrounded by sprawling gardens. The property is beautifully maintained and there is so much history around it. This should be part of every first-time visitor's itinerary. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot of ground to cover. I went in January, at the height of the Korean Winter, but enjoyed the walking tour immensely, despite the cold. Get there early in the morning (I arrived before 10AM) to avoid the queue at the ticket booth and the crowds. Don't miss the colorful Changing of the Guards ceremony that happens daily at 11AM. At the end of the ceremony, there's an opportunity to have your photos taken with the guards. The entrance fee of KRW3000 -- roughly US$2.50 -- is a small price to pay to see this picturesque, historical attraction. From my personal experience, it's not necessary to pay to join a group or package tour to get to this attraction. It's easy to get to this place. I went on my own and didn't have any issues. From my hotel in Myeong-dong District, I took the Seoul Metro (move from Line 4 to Line 3) to get there. Exit 5 takes you right to the doorstep of the Palace Museum, a few steps from which you'll find the ticket booth for the Palace itself. When you get to the Palace, there are free information brochures in all languages and best of all, free guided tours. English tours are scheduled at 11AM and 1:30PM."
5910,3.0,"It was a lovely, cold day. I was a little underwhelmed by the signage and organization of the Palace, but I loved that the museum attached was free and well-done."
5911,3.0,"This is my second time visited this place,first time is at 2003.To me it is nothing much different.You can see a lot of tradisional Korea style building all the way.We walked a lot to see all the houses and palaces as the place is very big and spacious except the specific palace which need to buy another ticket.You have to pay more if you want to visit more palaces. We bought ordinary entrance tickets only.The first time I came is during summer time,the scenes are so-so.The second time is during autumn,the views are totally different because we can see very beautiful maple trees."
5912,4.0,"I saw the guard changing ceremony at 3 pm on a Saturday. There are several free English guided tour per day. I was on the last one of the day at 3:30 pm. The lady was really nice and showed us the most important part of the palace. The explanation gave us a good perspective about the life of palace. The tour lasts about one hour. If the weather was not freezing the day i was there, I am sure I will be more happy about the trip. The only indoor place is the folk museum on the side. Overall, I enjoyed the palace tour."
5913,2.0,I've been here several times over the past decade as people have come to visit me in Seoul. My guests aren't usually too excited by the experience. I routinely ask locals if they've been and locals rarely have been more than 1 or 2 times in their lives.
5914,4.0,Too bad that we went here in the afternoon that is why we missed the changing of guards. What I really like the most is the big landscape of the palace and the mountain views in the palace. When we where there the small room in the middle of the lake reminds me of Moon embraces the sun. I really want to go there but it is restricted to visitors. We were already tired at the time when we visited this palace so we spent a little time in here.
5915,5.0,The name translates as the Palace of Shining Happiness. This palace has survived a lot of wars and rulers making is historical site a representation of how strong korea is as a nation and it's citizenry. The interesting folk museum and palace museum is housed here including beautiful traditional korean gardens. When in gyeongbogkung you must witness the royal changing of the guards that happens every hour from 10am - 3pm and of course have photos with the korean guards as well
5916,4.0,"The main attraction of going to Gyeongbokgung is to watch the changing of the guards. They say it is historically accurate, complete with exchange of passwords and stuff. It’s best to time your visit to watch the changing of the guards, and then go on the free guided tour which I think runs every hour. The tour guide gave lots of interesting information about the architectural features of the palace, like why there are three “lanes” going into the palace from the gates, or how the palace is heated during the winter months. She also gave told us a bit of history of Korea, the palace and the kings that occupied it. Overall it was 2 hours well spent.  If you’re into walking a lot, Gyeongbokgung is walking distance from Insadong, Jongmyeo Shrine, Changdeokgung Palace, Gwanghwamun Square and Cheonggyecheon Stream. So from Gyeongbokgung there are quite a number of choices of places you can go to."
5917,4.0,"Visiting a palace is an essential item in your Seoul itinerary. Gyeongbok-gung is one of the top palace and it is worth a visit as it is within easy reach via Subway.  Taking pictures with the guards are free and they are all dressed in traditional Korean Costume, if you time your visit correctly you can see the changing of guards too !"
5918,4.0,The name translates as the Palace of Shining Happiness.

5919,4.0,Worth a visit for a glimpse of historic Seoul. The changing of the guard (a few times a day) is fun to see and hear.  The palace is wonderful to see juxtaposed between the mountain on one side and the modern city on the other.  The place is massive. You could explore for hours easily.
5920,4.0,"Impressive, huge Korean style royal palace. A must see in Seoul, but beware visiting involves a lot more walking AROUND buildings than inside them, and January in Seoul is usually bitterly cold, so dressing appropriately is essential (i.e. at least skiing-type clothes). I enjoyed the visit in spite of the cold, although I expected it to be a lot more about interior decoration than it proved to be the case."
5921,4.0,We went there this Jan and we saw the ceremony of the guards changing. Really nice. The palace is huge and really nice altough not the originsl one - that was distroyed long time ago and they rebuild it after that. It is well preserved and you can feel the days of the dunasty. Also you have access to the national museum and there are lovely exhibitions. Go and visit!
5922,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is interesting in the fact that it layed in ruins for over 200 years! From the late 16th century until the mid 19th century Gyeongbokgung was abandonded, Changdeokgung Palace was the main palace of the royal family during this time. Therefore, it must be noted there is basically nothing inside the palace that dates before the major rebuilding period of the 1860's.  So while there are a few buildings that are between 100 and 150 years old, sadly much of the palace was destroyed during the Japanese Colonial period. What we see today is a masterful reproduction of the original with a few important authentic Joseon buildings still remaining. Most of the buildings that we see are very recently built, just in the last 20-30 years.  Nevertheless, I always enjoy my time here. For one, the palace has a grand atmosphere, the buildings are large and are built in classic Joseon architecture. My favorite palace is without a doubt Changdeokgung, in large part because it is the best preserved palace and the gardens are exquisite. I do feel however, that the two palaces compliment each other. Changdeokgung is the authentic Joseon palace, which is typically called the most ""Korean"" of all 5 Joseon palaces. Gyeongbokgung is really a product of the final years of the Joseon Dyansty, and the architecture is built in a style that is supposed to legitimize the Korean King as an Emperor.  For anyone who enjoys history (like myself) you will enjoy Gyeongbokgung. I had plenty of time in Korea, so I was able to visit all 5 royal palaces on more than one occassion. If you only have time to visit one palace, visit Changdeokgung, but if you have more time, by all means enjoy the grand Gyeongbokgung Palace."
5923,4.0,"Not much to see when you're inside the palace. As the palace was destroyed and burnt before, many parts are still under reconstruction. However, it's worth watching the changing of guards taking place at the entrance of the palace every hour of the day. You don't have to pay to watch this."
5924,4.0,"After repeated requests from our tour guide for a chance to don the Hanbok ( traditional Korean costume), my daughter and i finally got the opportunity to do so within the confines of the Gyeongbokgung Palace. It meant cutting short the palace tour proper and queuing up for about two hours at a designated place. When noontime came, the attendant advised us that they would be closing for lunch and would be resuming at 1 pm. Since we were already next in line, our Korean guide pleaded that we be allowed a few minutes extension since our bus was no longer capable of waiting for us much longer.They understood our predicament and finally conceded. My daughter and i were given the choice of color and kind of costume we wanted to wear. A costumed Korean ""lady-in-waiting"" assisted the both of us inside the dressing room. She asked us to remove our rubber shoes and produced two pairs of Korean shoes for us to wear . She then motioned us, one at a time to go up an elevated platform, to spread our arms as she went about fastening the costumes in a wrap-around fashion on top of our shirt and pants. Our guide ably took our souvenir shots wearing these costumes at the palace grounds. We boarded our tourist bus, happy at having completed the Hanbok experience.."
5925,4.0,This is a must-see if you want to learn and see old Korean style buildings. It is beautiful. Do not miss the change of the guards. Easy to combine with the shopping area (authentc Korean style) Insadong on walking distance.
5926,5.0,"Considering Korea has lots of these palaces, we aimed to see the best and chose Gyeongbukgong and we were definitely not disappointed. Our visit was like a time travel to the early days of how Korea was like. As a K-drama fanatic myself, it was definitely worth a visit if you go to Korea."
5927,5.0,"this is a beautiful palace, with traditional guards out front. there are several ""changing of the guard"" ceremonies throughout the day, make sure you stay for one of these."
5928,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung is a great palace, a traditional Korean palace open for tourists and citizens. There are several scenic palace and places for tourists, including a banquet place, and beautiful garden and lake with snow on the surface."
5929,5.0,"Gyeong-bok-gung  The magnificent Gyeongbokgung, which was first built in 1395, had a painful and bitter historical background. The Palace, or the complex, was actually destroyed twice under different circumstances during the period of 600 years. The present spectacular Palace complex was rebuilt to their past glory and splendor only as from 1990.  The Palace complex is very important to the people of Korea, as it is a national symbol of sovereignty to them. Visitors should not just admire the beauty of the well-kept gardens, ponds and lakes, but spend time to appreciate the various structures, some of which were constructed entirely according to Korean architectural designs; others were built under foreign influences. Different palaces were also built to serve different purposes, such as grand halls for ceremonial functions, rooms for discussing affairs of the State with officials, halls for entertainment, rooms for reading and writing for the monarch, private quarters of the royalties, and for their servants.  There are four main gates in the Palace Complex; the most famous gate will be the Gwang-hwa-mun, where traditional ceremonial changing of the guards is performed at fixed intervals. But most important of all, visitors should avail themselves the opportunity to visit the adjoining presidential ground, which was closed for many years for security reason, but opened to the general public only in early 2011."
5930,4.0,"i have been there for more than 3 times, in different seasons, winter is the best time to pay the visit, especially after the snow"
5931,5.0,Visited Gyeongbokgung late November so it was starting to get chilly. It is easily accessed via the Gyeongbokgung Palace station on Seoul Subway line 3. We were able to catch the Changing of the Guards. Don't forget to take tons of photos with the guards and the lovely red and yellow foliage.
5932,4.0,Easy access from subway. The exit/entrance from subway was decorated to have a feel of the historic palace. A palace with cluster dwellings for the palace workers. Beautiful architecture and carvings made for good photography. They have a procession of guards at certain time of the day. They have FREE guides done by students in English! You can see them in their bright orange jacket. A few other museum around the palace grounds. This place is huge! Take us a few hours to cover the whole ground. Only our hunger for lunch stop us from covering the whole ground. There's a cafe in the museum building to have hot coffee. We head to Insadong for lunch which is nearby across the street. Visited in December 2012.
5933,5.0,"The palace is a must stop if in the Insadong area. This is a Truly a photogenic stop with a piece of the past in the middle of a shiny modern city, complete with the mountains and trees framed perfectly by the design of the palace and surrounding gardens. It was a very cold outdoor walk for us on X-mas eve but worth it for the history and beauty. Warm up after in any of the nearby coffee or tea shops, there's even a Starbucks located just up the street. ;) I imagine summer and fall are the best walks here for the gardens and Koi ponds that were very frozen over at the time of our visit. A Lovely walk about.. back in time."
5934,5.0,Just amazing when it's covered in snow ... we wanted to rent hanboks but was told that it was unavailable due to the weather. Very nice walk outside the palace along Samchongdonggil towards other museums and plenty of cafes to chill along the way ...
5935,4.0,"The snow doesn't stop anyone from visiting, I think it made the place more beautiful. Wear decent shoes in the winter though, because the paths were not all cleared of the snow and it was deep in a few places."
5936,5.0,You may have watched some dramas and well reality is better than on tv. I went to Gyeongbok during fall and it was magical! The trees were turning red and yellow and with the mountains in the background everything seemed like a dream. It is one of the best place to go in Seoul! Very pretty.
5937,5.0,"Enjoy walking around at this palace, tickets include museums visits. Trees in the garden are very nice during my period of visit. Walking distance to InsaDong. Easy access to this palace"
5938,4.0,"The palace grounds is nice and really big,but I wished they did not run of English guide books though because there are some beautiful structures that I have missed, especially the very photogenic pavillion. I enjoyed the hourly changing of guards ceremony as well."
5939,4.0,"Imagine large palace with interesting stories behind them.... hence, it'll be good if you manage to catch a guide that gives free tour at regular interval.  Be sure to get there before 4pm or so (please check closing timing as it differs time to time) as ticketing close an hour before closing time... we missed it by ten minutes during our first trip there :(  There's a National Palace Museum at the side with some interesting displays, taking about an hour or less to finish viewing, a good side visit if you have some time on hand,... or happened to missed the ticketing time (like us)"
5940,3.0,This is part of Gyeongbokgung Palace so I'm not sure why it has it's own post. The palace was beautiful.
5941,3.0,"Even on December 23rd when it is below 0C/32F it was packed--I have only one photo that does not have 10 other tourists in it. Very large--largest palace I think (at least with half of Changdeokgung being closed). Even though it was packed, there was an odd feeling of vacancy there because of how large it is."
5942,4.0,"We took the English tour and it certainly gives more information than what is posted on the signs around the palace. The palace is pretty, even in winter, but I think it would be nicer in warmer weather. The changing of the guards was cut short due to extreme cold weather (a little below freezing). The information here really complements the Jongmyo Shrine tour (we did the shrine first, but either order would work)."
5943,3.0,"as it snowed and rained the day before, the staff sprinkled sand everywhere to prevent people from slipping on the frozen water puddles on the ground. shoes became super dirty with mixture of water and sand = mud but still, it's for safety reasons. palace is just like any other regular palace with courtyard etc.."
5944,5.0,"There are many Palaces in Seoul so unless you have a lot of time, you need to limit the ones you do see. I chose two and this is one of them. The reasons are that it has a changing of the guards ceremony and also the beauty of the grounds. This palace has the oldest history of Royalty in Korea (the Joseon Dynasty) and is the largest and once inside and you see the enormity of it you will understand the Royalty that it once stood for. The changing of the guards starts inside the main gate and marches to the front of the entrance, which is also called the Gwanghwamun Gate, so if taking pictures, you need to place yourself inside first. I actually like the changing of the guards ceremony at Deoksugung Palace better, but this one is good also. Once inside, and you need to buy a ticket, the grounds are enormous, and go forever. I like the Kimchi building with the different size kettles, and the large central pond. There are many buildings here. I would suggest doing this tour earlier in the day rather than later, as it will get tiring. Definite visit on your Seoul trip."
5945,5.0,"My visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace was a definite highlight of my time in Seoul. It is the largest of the five Grand Palaces from the Joseon Dynasty, and it's grandness and majesty have to be seen to be believed. Make sure you get there in time to see the changing of the guard, which happens every hour from 10am to 3pm. The National Folk Museum is also housed in the grounds of the palace, and is well worth a visit. Admission to the Palace is 3,000 won (adults) and 1,500 won (children)."
5946,4.0,"The palace offers free guided tour (first one for English starts 11am) but unfortunately the timing was not right for us. We were told that there are uni students giving free tours of the palace as well but we could not locate them. That was why we decided to rent an audio guide for 3,000won. The content was informative but if you don't mind reading, I recommend that you skip the audio guide and go for the free guide book that you can find once you enter the ticketed entrance. The written guide comes with illustration & pictures, to give you a better idea on what to look out for.  The palace is very accessible. We took the metro to Gyeongbukgong metro stop. One of the exits will lead you straight to the palace. The palace wasn't very crowded when we first got there at 9am, but the crowds started to stream in by the time we left at 1pm.  The buildings in the palace are small but the palace grounds is quite large. Note that many of the buildings are restored works rather than originals. The landscaping looked nice and left me desiring ti want to see it in spring & autumn."
5947,3.0,"It's a huge place, but a lot of the buildings were actually restored and not its original state. There are also some buildings still under restoration. After a short while of walking, the buildings look kinda similar to me, but that's just me.  The changing of palace guards ceremony was pretty interesting though, so that's something you should check out if you have the chance."
5948,4.0,Nice palace. There is a very elaborate changing of the guard ceremony that takes about 15 minutes and start in the center grounds and moves out to the front gate and finishes in the center court. Definitely worth the trip.
5949,5.0,"Honestly I was inspired to come here because of historical KDramas like Jewel in the Palace, Yi San and Roots. It's truly magnificent and inspiring. I was lucky to witness the changing of the guards so check the times before you go so you don't miss out on that aaand the other ceremony, I think it was crowning the King or him visiting-it was a spectacle to see all his subjects lining up and all the musicians and dancers in celebration. I rented the audio guide and tried to match it with the map. I suggest at least having that if you miss the guided English tour-otherwise the visit may deem boring and meaningless. Come with an open mind to discover the wisdom and experience of a different culture! The tickets are beyond cheap as singles but you can also buy a pack-one for each palace as well. Enjoy!"
5950,3.0,"Feels a little bit too restored, but there is a great juxtaposition between the Japanese and Korean architecture here. The changing of the guard is great to see as well and the complex is huge! Definitely worth a visit in Seoul."
5951,2.0,"I used to see lively events at the Gyeongbokgung premises five years ago when my family visited the site. There were bult-up rooms with characters and figurines inside as well as Hanbok costumes photos sessions. On 17Dec2012, it was a great dismay as many rooms are boarded up."
5952,3.0,"Maybe I'm biased because I already visit a gazillion palaces and historic sites in Beijing prior to my Seoul trip, so Gyeongbokgung did not really stand out as a ""must see"". However, I will say the highlight was watching the changing of the guards ceremony as that was something unique to me. The guards are all really tall and good looking like in the Korean dramas, which is always a plus :) I did not go into the palace, but if you love sightseeing and history, perhaps it's worth it!"
5953,3.0,We got a free tour by booking online via the Korea Tourism Board. It was interesting and scenic although some parts can be dragging. Entrance ticket is quite cheap too.
5954,4.0,"With so many palace around, we decided to just go to this one. The entrance fees is pretty cheap. Took and audio guide too, but found it not necessary as there is a free English guided tour. Remember to go see the guard changing ceremony."
5955,4.0,"I'ts actually my second time to visit gyeongbukgung palace. First time during autumn, this time at the onset of winter. I'd say it looked better during autumn but then there was no snow yet when I came, so...  What facinated was the history that unfolded on its walls. It's a visit, even just to bring home that iconic picture in front of its gate:-)and during the changing of the guards ceremony"
5956,4.0,Nice to see the changing of the guard. I think they have it each day and definitely worth checking out.
5957,5.0,The in-house guide was great and informative! She was also passionate about what she was telling us. I now understand the Koreans grief over losing their royalty because of the deeds of the Japanese.
5958,5.0,You can see very beautiful scenery around the Palace especially in Autumn. Colorful trees will take your breath away :)
5959,5.0,This place is very neat. It is well kept and beautiful. It does get busy so get there early and see everything before the crowd takes the place over.
5960,5.0,"What a beautiful palace, and as with all monuments in Korea, so well-looked after ... the changing of the Guard is not to be missed, the soldiers are so impressive in their costumes... also very rewarding visit inside the King's quarters, plus stunning pagoda building of the National Folk Museum ..."
5961,5.0,"All place are very beautiful there althought many people but still cozy, relax and comfortable.. Beautiful and wonderful palace.."
5962,4.0,"Nice place to take photos. Quite a bit smaller than the Forbidden City in Beijing. But, there distinct differences in the Chinease architecture and the Korean one. But, you have to look for it. If you find it, its work the visit. Especially, if you arrive in time for the ""Changing of the Guards""."
5963,5.0,"Visited Gyeongbokgung during autumn and had a very pleasant time here. The complex is rather large, with at least 13 points of interest, and spent about 3 hours leisurely strolling the grounds and exploring the buildings. Arrived at 9am (opening time) on a Saturday and found very few people which quickly increased in number by 10am.  Entrance fee is KRW3000 (~USD2.70), and tickets can be bought just past the main gate (called Gwanghwamun), on the right side. The brochure is available after entering the next gate (Heungnyemun), and don't forget to pick one up! This is an excellent brochure and was quite sufficient for exploring the complex. It includes a timeline of Gyeongbokgung, a map, and each major area is described along with diagrams and photos (some with colour). Note that the National Folk Museum (the pagoda building) is a separate free attraction and lies outside of the palace complex (though seemingly part of it). Just be sure to keep your ticket if you end up in this pagoda building as you make your way back to Gyeongbokgung (there is a ticket check between the two).  The highest concentration of visitors are in the main throne hall and main residences but the crowd thins the deeper you go within the complex. While the buildings after sometime become similar, the entire complex is still worth going through, though not as picturesque. For instance the ceiling of the queen dowager's residence (where the ten longevity chimney is also located) appears untouched with worn out colours, and provides a good insight into what these ceilings looked like pre-renovation. Jibokjae had an unusual architecture, and the pond with the pavilion is simply pretty.  The route based on the numbering in the brochure allows one to circle the palace complex, ending at the main throne hall and out the main gate, in time for the hourly changing of the guards. This is a reenactment of the original ceremony from the 15th century and occurs every hour from 10am-3pm, making for an interesting addition to a visit here.  Note Gyeongbokgung is closed on Tuesdays (together with Jongmyo Shrine). If considering visiting the other three palaces and Jongmyo shrine, best to get the combination ticket, which is good for one month. These are all within walking distance but likely difficult to properly appreciate in one full day, and requires greater stamina too. Other nearby attractions are the Folk Art Musem as mentioned, National Palace Museum, and Insadong for traditional shopping and dining.  To get to Gyeongbokgung Palace by metro, take Subway Line 3 to Gyeongbokgung Station (Exit 5)."
5964,3.0,"If you've been the palaces in China, you'd probably be disappointed. The architecture (excuse me for my ignorance) is very Chinese. The palace is not particularly grand or spectacular."
5965,3.0,The perfect place to experience to get a real historic palace as seen in Korean drama.If you only have time to visit one palace then make it this one and can easily spend 3 hours around the royal palace.
5966,5.0,"With the entrance fee is a free tour of the palace and grounds. The tour was great and very worth the time. If we had wandered around the palace on our own, we would have enjoyed, but I think we would have missed large parts (it is much bigger than it looks at the beginning). The tour guide was great, and explained a lot of things about the architecture and features of the buildings that were really interesting."
5967,5.0,"I visited this historical site in Seoul just over a month ago when I went to South Korea for the first time. I very much enjoyed my time there, the sights, sounds, smells and tastes - I wrote several blog posts about this mega city and made a video. Please go to my blog site for more detailed impressions: http://www.junyingkirk.com/?p=3711, and also a link to my Youtube to see this palace for yourself: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erwK3xFVOvI&feature=g-upl."
5968,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace was arguably the most beautiful and remained the grandest of all five palaces, Changdeokgung, Gyeongheegung…It was the central building of the King’s residence. There were 9 rooms , the central room was where the king slept and the surrounding 8 rooms were where the court ladies kept night watch. It was worth seeing and you could spend little to lots of time checking it all out. Opened at 9am and there were just a few people here and there."
5969,5.0,"The palace is very well built, beautiful lake is there with nice pleasant gardens, the stone and wood carvings are a must see, you may have a chance to see the cultural show near the museum which is worth a see..."
5970,5.0,Palace grounds are immense! Each building is unique in its purpose though the architecture is pretty much the same. Check out the official travel site for free English guided tours.
5971,4.0,"My mum and I visited this palace (supposedly the grandest) and combined it with a trip to the National Folk and Palace museum (which are on opposite sides of the palace and both free). The entire experience took about 3.5 hours.  It was beautiful, but parts of it are undergoing restoration. We did not take the free tours, but we did take one at the Changdeokgung Palace and there were many similar features ( I recommend that you take one so you can appreciate the significance of all the little things) like the number of pathways, the colouring, the animal statues on the roofs etc.  Make sure you catch the guard changing ceremony (supposedly every hour), this is at the front of the palace (near the main entry point)"
5972,3.0,"This ""palace"" is in a park full of other historic replicas and a museum introducing visitors to Korean culture. It was all a bit strange to me."
5973,4.0,The palace and grounds give a feeling of serenity in the middle of the city. Gradually being restored to its former glory. Worth a visit to escape the bustle of the city and exceptionally good value
5974,5.0,"a great architecture histories palace. i like the feeling of pretending myself as one of the general in the ancience years ago who walked from the front to the main hall and stayed there, waiting for the king. this is a place to know historic of korea and refresh of all screen that i seen in korea drama..haha"
5975,4.0,"It's quite an experience to really step into a historic Palace where most people only view them in dramas. Kind of crowded in the morning. They have a ceremony at specific timings where there's music and guards ""marching"".  It's a huge palace. When we are there, some little parts are undergoing construction. But we still enjoy our trip there."
5976,5.0,Wear your walking shoes this place is huge. The Female English tour guide had interesting insights into the role of women in Korean palaces--think concubine verses wife.
5977,3.0,"We enjoyed the beauty of this. Unfortunately, when we went it was cold and I don't think we gave the palace due justice. There isn't much to do, but we also had our son and were not able to spend a good amount of time taking a tour or audio tour. I am certainly glad we saw this beautiful palace though."
5978,5.0,Its an amazing and Historic place where you can learn a lot about South Koreans. Keep your schedule free for most part of the day as the area is huge and could find a lot of things of interest.
5979,5.0,"It famous of its name "" Korea first palace"", strategically located at the heart of Seoul. You must visit this place as it is where the history of Korea is born. The royal of Korea is establish here.  Chinese, Japanese and English translate is available here, the chinese translator could speak fluent chinese enable us to understand the story of this Palace. It is a place full of ""Feng Shui"" arrangement and every single building has it own meanings. Then you could discover that how smart the Korean built it country.  If you come Korea but miss this place then you know Korea nothing better. I would strongly recommend you to visit here and follow the tour guide translate so to help you understand what you are seeing."
5980,3.0,You need to know in advance when you would like to visit as this place has weird times for visitors. They seem to favour tour groups.
5981,4.0,"This is a very cool place right in the middle of the city. It reminds me very much of the forbidden city in China, but apparently is older. It is much smaller scale than China and not as busy. If you are in the downtown area it is well worth the visit. The changing of the guards happens everyday at 11am and is really interesting. The costumes and pageantry are very interesting to see."
5982,3.0,Spectacular imperial guards changing shift performance.  Get a feel of the actual shooting spot in the Korean's imperial series. It is amazing that the palace is situated right in the center of bustling city of Seoul.
5983,4.0,"Similar experience to visiting the forbidden city in Beijing, though a much smaller and lesser extent but still interesting to see the Korean royal palace."
5984,5.0,"This palace is the grandest of the palaces and enormous! Would be worth waiting for the English walking tour if you have time (otherwise grab a guide from the information booth to the right of the main gate). There is a guard changing ceremony ( at set times, cancelled due to weather at times); we got to see the guards at the gate. I'd also recommend taking the opportunity to dress in traditional costumes at the tea house (free, must sign up)."
5985,5.0,"This was the first site we visited in Seoul. We joined the English tour, which took a little more than an hour. The palace gave tremendous insight into the prevailing culture and principles of the Joseon dynasty. I was impressed that, unlike other palaces, there was no emphasis on excess and luxury. Instead, they had a stream for purifying the mind, simple dwelling places for the royal family, and even a quiet place for the king to reflect. The buildings were big, but relatively austere.  After the tour, we watched the changing of the guard ceremony at the Gwanghamun Gate. This happens hourly from 10am to 3pm, so you can catch it before or after the tour. Entrance to the palace costs KRW3000 (less than UD$3), tours are free."
5986,3.0,"It was raining heavily as we get out from the metro station. To make it worse the National Palace Museum is closed. As we enter the side entrance from the museum, we saw the ticket counter and information counter all closed. Quite a number of visitors or tourists seems to be upset coz not allowed by the guard to enter the palace. Maybe it's already closing time. So, advisable to visit this place in the morning."
5987,4.0,"Even though I visited the palace on a weekday, it was full of tourists and Korean schoolchildren on field trips. It's good to remember that the palace is closed on Tuesday."
5988,5.0,We were very happy to experience the palace. It's very exotic for us to see this kind of architecture and splendour. You have to go there when the weather is good as you have to walk around the buildings.
5989,4.0,The place is very big and so it can take quite a long time to visit the whole palace. You have a guide book provided to help you get around and understand the history of the palace. You can also see the contrast between the palace and the view of some of the main buildings in Seoul.
5990,4.0,The Palace is a remarkable reconstruction of the Joseon Dynasty era but it lacks details showing how people lived during that period.
5991,4.0,"A must visit place, to understand what it was like to be living in palace years back. Take a walk in the grounds, and understand the different parts of the palace, its purpose, occupants and its history. There is also guard change ceremony, which is pretty interesting too. Go on a weekday if you want to avoid the weekend crowds :)"
5992,5.0,"If your visiting Korea, this palace is definitely a must see. The palace area is so large, and the scenery is so beautiful with mountains in the distance. It almost feels like your not even in the city. The palace guards are dressed in the traditional costumes, so don't forget to get a photo with one! I'd also recommend getting a tour, or at least a map (it's easy to get a bit lost here!)  The folk museum, wasn't really worth checking out, in my opinion. I found roaming around the traditional buildings more exciting.  Also I think it only cost 3,000 won to get in. Very cheap! So definitely check this place out!"
5993,4.0,"Large grounds, so be prepared to spend hours there exploring and learning. Try to read about the Palace before visiting and spend time reading the various signs explaining the buildings. Very crowded. Nearby, the National Folk Museum is located. Good place to visit for a historical background of the daily lives of the ordinary Korean people."
5994,4.0,"Where do i start? I kinda got lost inside the palace, I was walking somewhere I think is suppose to be the servant's area and I have no idea where i am by the time i notice i was lost. It is really nice place to have a look. and Just a tip, bring along a water bottle and a cap if you are going around noon, you would need that :)"
5995,4.0,We visited the Gyeongbokgung palace to watch the changing of the guard and get a tour of the palace. It's a great experience for young and old. Great look into the history of Korea. Also the free cultural museum accessable from palace is also awesome. Our English tour guide was knowledgeable and funny. Highly recommend it on your visit to Seoul.
5996,5.0,"It's the grandest of all the palaces in Seoul, South Korea. It majestically dominates the Ganghwamun Square. It's actually a complex of many buildings sprawled in a vast area.Its main daily attraction is the changing of the Royal Guards ceremony in full traditional colorful costumes during certain times and many says its comparable to the changing of the guards in London."
5997,3.0,"Maybe it was a rainy day, maybe it was when all the trees looked dry, maybe because I had too much expectiation... or maybe it was because we could only see the palace from the outer garden (you cant view the rooms, etc). So it was just an okay experience for me."
5998,4.0,"We visited the Gyeongbokgung palace complex our last day in Korea. It is a large sprawling area, with views of the current Presidential 'Blue House' which is to the rear of this area. It is unfortunite that most of the structures are recreations since the Japanese destroyed most of the buidling after their 1910 annexation of Korea. Definitely take either the guided tour, or rent the earphone that tells you about the structures. I enjoyed this quite a bit, especially the colorful and musical changing of the Guards. The other nearby palace complex was also good, with its secret gardens."
5999,3.0,Architecture to be appreciated. And historical facts learnt. Beautiful vast palace interior to roam around.
6000,4.0,"Visiting the Palace during Chuseok just added to the experience. There were people dressed in traditional costumes, dancers, and special events going on in the children's section, including traditional games. The Palace wasn't crowded, we were able to roam around and take lots of pictures. The Palace is easy to get to, and there is a money exchange inside which is very helpful. Be sure to give yourself enough time to walk to all the different sections. One of my favorites was the replication of a village from the 1940's, including the comic book shop. I would recommend that you either eat before going to the Palace, or take some snacks with you. It is so big that it takes several hours to see everything. There are places to fill your water bottle and the bathrooms were clean."
6001,5.0,"Gyeongbok Palace has to be the number one attraction in Seoul. I never get tired of watching the changing of the guard, the changing of the leaves, or the changing faces of the tourists from all aover the world who flock to its grounds. A vast expense of land in the center of Seoul yours for exploring at your own leasure without too much interference from low key museum staff. Take a camera of course and be prepared to walk away with hundreds of wonderful compositions from magnificant architectural roofs to detailed close-ups of ancient fixtures and doors. Well worth spending a half a day exploring preceded by and with a follow on late lunch or early dinner. High noon is the spectacle of spectacles with the changing of the guards, so don;t miss it. One of many palaces in and around Seoul but in my humble opinion the best preserved and most professionaly presented and maintained."
6002,4.0,Lovely palace in the centre of Seoul. Gardens are spectacular as are the courtyards - shame about the 'empty' rooms.
6003,5.0,Showed us the beauty of the ancient Korean kings and restoration of this magnificent compound. Well worth the time to wander these grounds.
6004,4.0,"This is indeed a nice palace located at the middle of the busy city. It is accessible by Seoul Metro and the palace itself is big and cool enough! There's no need to purchase the ticket and enter the palace, just take some pictures outside the palace is good enough! Don't forget the be there at 10am then you would see the changing guards ceremony for free! After this palace, you can just walk to Samcheong-dong, Bukchon Village and Insadong by walking! Easy!"
6005,5.0,here is the perfect location for families and couples..really nice when u like traditional culture its here perfect to see it....u can make many pictures and when u come at morning u can see many many more.....
6006,4.0,The guard shift-swapping ceremony was impressive. The building itself was so-so... perhaps i wastoo impressed by the Beijing Palace or the Paris Palace Versille
6007,3.0,"Went here during the obligatory tourist day of a business trip to Seoul.  We watched the changing of the guard shortly after arriving at 10. A few people brightly dressed as traditional korean warriors marched around a bit but didn't really do much else.  Pretty impressive overall though and a fairly large complex to explore. We had a group tour guide who was full of interesting information about the place, which brought it to life a bit more.  Some of it is original but much has been extensively restored, but done in a sympathetic manor.  I guess it depends how much you like this sort of place but we took about 1.5 hours to see all the major bits of the complex and I thought that was enough."
6008,5.0,"This was my favorite place in Korea. Everything is gorgeous! Also, they serve sikhye there which is to die for. I cannot wait to go back to Gyeongbokgung."
6009,4.0,We went during chuseok and it was perfect timing (also free). There was tons going on. A little crowded but the place is huge. Really did not expect it to be that big. I would suggest taking a picnic along and finding a nice spot to chill. Changing of the guards was pretty cool.
6010,5.0,"got to see where the emperors used to live and it's an amazing place, everybody should visit it...................helped me to better understand Korea..........................................................."
6011,5.0,This is worth the time to visit. It shows you what life was like back in the old days. It is also a good picture opportunity.
6012,5.0,"This palace complex is the largest and totally worth visiting. It has some interesting architecture and great photo opportunities. Be sure to go northeast in the complex to get some tea or coffee for a break. They also have an area where you can wear costumes for fun at no charge, which provides some photo ops. Just past that area is the building that has a nice body of water in front of it - reflection pools, and they are beautiful. Then at the northwest corner towards the pagoda is the folk art musuem, which is totally worth the visit and free."
6013,3.0,i initially planned on joining the free english tour of this palace but decided not to when i was there. it's a big place from what i see outside. i managed to catch the changing of guards ceremony. it's still considered outside the palace so you don't have to pay admission fee to watch it. i'm not exactly a fan of places with historical value and all that so i moved on after watching the ceremony.
6014,4.0,"i was here on a sunday in October,the weather was quite warm for me but the sun are real big.remember to bring your sunglasses or you won't be able to open your eyes to see the historical building which are still colourful and well maintained.please be prepare that you will need to walk quite a lot,plus taking photo,watch the shift changing of the palace guard.the palace closed on Monday so take note if you are planning to go there."
6015,4.0,"I joined the English tour in the afternoon. Unfortunately, not everything the tour guide said was understandable; her tone was also not too exciting.  Anyway, you get taken around about half of the buildings, and are given some history and explanation of some features. When the tour ends after about an hour, you are free to explore on your own.  What I liked the most are the two small islands, one on the west and one on the north of the complex --- together with the surroundings, these create opportunities for some amazing photos."
6016,3.0,"if u never been to seoul, this should be a stop on ur trip.  i enjoy the open space within the grounds of the palace.  i gave gyeongbokgung palace average only because i just went to beijing and visited the forbidden palace, which is amazing. gyeongbokgung is not as grand as forbidden palace.  i believe my experience would be better if i have a tour guide or use a english audio guide."
6017,5.0,"The sheer enormity of Gyeongbokgung Palace can be a bit daunting, but I do encourage anyone visiting Seoul to take a few hours to wander through the grounds of this amazing palace.  After passing through Gwanghwamun Gate (the main gate of the palace, which is itself enormous and visually stunning, especially as it is lit up at night), there are many structures to walk through within the temple's vast walls, along with amazing courtyards, pavilions, statues and traditional Korean gardens. Each gate and doorway passed through provides new and wonderful sights to take in. The temple's vibrant color scheme of teal, red, purple and orange -- seemingly standard throughout most if not all of Korea's temples and palaces -- is a delight to behold.  The National Folk Museum of Korea, as well as the National Palace Museum of Korea, are also located within its walls, and tours are available for both.  The palace is very easy to get to, with close access to the subway and bus routes, and seems surprising and almost out of place in the middle of such a busy city. But once inside its impressive walls, one can quickly forget that you're in a bustling, modern city and allow yourself to be transported to a different and distant time.  Although it attracts a lot of tourists, I highly recommend spending a few hours visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace -- you won't be disappointed. And if you can visit on a weekday the crowds will be far fewer."
6018,5.0,"The architecture of the buildings and the landscaping of the grounds are simply awe-inspiring. I visited on a very busy Fall Saturday afternoon. Thousands upon thousands of people around. Yet the immense palace grounds afforded many locations to get away from the crowds and watch the birds, look off to the mountains in the distance, or simply sit and enjoy the nice Fall breeze. A drumming team was practicing outside of a building on the grounds with a large pond surrounding it. The gymnastic abilities and rhythms used by the young drumming team were incredible.  The majestic beauty of this site, the incredibly cheap entry fee of 3000KRW, and the availability of programmes and pamphlets in English make this attraction a must-see."
6019,4.0,"huge palace, well preserved and very2 beautiful parks inside. autumn colors full blown. can have picnic inside"
6020,5.0,Not much in the way of furnishings as they were all burned or destroyed but be sure to look for times for changing of the guard so you don't miss it.
6021,4.0,"If we had visited China's Palaces, this palace seems small and quiet. But the entrance fees is only 2400 won! But there is a different culture and life in this palace which also houses a Museum where we could see settings of several events, such as making of kimchi.  But the best thing of all is there are a group of Korean costume-cladded maidens who are there if you want to take pictures with them. They seemed not to speak English, but by using the international language (hand gestures), they were willing to take some beautiful pictures with us.  There are a lot of historical facts which the guide will talk and talk but this historical piece is worth a visit even without the ramblings!"
6022,5.0,"This is a beautiful palace that has loads of buildings to see, excellent grounds for a nice stroll, and even free events and demonstrations on a regular basis. We visit this palace every time we travel to Seoul. Its in the heart of the city, however when you pass through the palace walls, you forget where you are and get lost in the romantics of history and culture!"
6023,3.0,"I suppose that everyone will go for a visit when you are first time in Seoul. Being Chinese, I am not so keen because we do have similar structure in China. Well, the guards were a bit of good experience since you can take photos arounfd them. Other than that, pretty average experience for me. I actually got in there because I got lost on my way to other locations."
6024,5.0,"I'm in awe with the size and scale of this palace. I'm also so very happy I dropped the 3000 Won for the audio guide. It was highly informative and provided me with a much richer experience than if I'd just bumbled through the place. For a moment I stopped to listen to the free tour and it seemed quite worthwhile, too, providing even more color than the audio guide. I would recommended it if you're into a slightly more structured walk. My favorite part? Hyangwonejong in the back - a phenomenally beautiful pagoda and pond. I could have spent hours there."
6025,3.0,"We spent about two hours at the palace. There are plaques at each building in English so we were able to learn quite a bit about Korean history, even the part about why coffee and coffee shops are so popular in Korea. An interesting place to visit if you have couple hours free while in Seoul as the admission was very low compared with other historical places around the world."
6026,5.0,"This is the meaning of the word Gyeongbokgung and it fits the palace so well. I arranged for a two day stopover in Seoul and checked online for places of interest. This was on the top of my list. I arrived in Seoul and stayed at the Sky Hotel which had free shuttle service and was two blocks from the metro for downtown Seoul. Excellent location!!! Took the metro to the Palace and arrived just in time for the changing of the guards which was absolutely beautiful and very entertaining with music, costumes, drums, marching bands, etc. I enjoyed it so much that after I toured the palace and grounds, I stayed for the next guard change which is on the hour. The Seoul metro makes it very easy to get around the city and it is very reasonable also. Two days was enough time to see most of the important sights of the city. Food was delicious esp. the area called the Samcheongdong with its wonderful street food. Also went to the Jeongdong theatre for the ""Miso"" showing (full house). You can take a city bus tour (hop on, hop off) for only ten US dollars, I real bargain!!!"
6027,4.0,"While the palace was rebuilt after the war, they clearly want to share a bit of Korean history with you. I'd take a tour though, as the outer buildings don't have a lot of information included."
6028,5.0,"The palaces were briliant, so much history behind them. The cost wasnt so bad either, we paid 9000 korean won for 4!"
6029,5.0,"You can't go to Seoul without visiting this extraordinary palace. You also can't miss it, it's right in the middle of one of the busiest areas of the city, near City Hall and the US Embassy. Fascinating look at the ceremonial side of the Korean royal dynasty, the massive buildings are impressive and the smaller pavilions are beautiful, especially the ones sitting peacefully in the small lakes. And make sure you see the Changing of the Guard ceremony, great pageantry & very colorful. Also, don't miss the Folk Museum which is on the palace grounds (look for the very tall pagoda). Great place to start a visit to wonderful Seoul!"
6030,5.0,I went during the Korean national holiday and Chinese national holiday so lots of tourists there. The place covers a lot of acres and definitely has a few buildlings that offer fantastic photo spots. The changing of the guards is nice to watch and it's explained in English in addition to Korean and Mandarin. Admission prices in Seoul are generally a bargain compared to European and American sight admissions. If you have to pick one palace to visit in Seoul this would be the one. Deongsukgung would be the other as they also have a changing of the guards.
6031,5.0,"This is a former royal palace, most of which was destroyed during the Japanese occupation of Korea. Buildings have been restored and are a fascinating insight into times gone by."
6032,4.0,"It is quite nice. It is similar to other palaces in Seoul, but on a much bigger and grandeur scale. What was really impressive though was seeing the changing of the guards ceremony."
6033,5.0,"They have done such a wonderful job with the palace and although very touristy wasn't as crowded as some places I have been in both Europe and Asia. Thought the palace was beautiful, the guide books are very informative and there really is so much to see. I LOVED the gardens at the back of the palace leading off the folk museum. They were absolutely stunning."
6034,5.0,Good experience to see the building. There are so many tourists but I still enjoy the great walk around here.
6035,5.0,"I visited this Palace in 2009 when I was in Seoul - I found my way there from Incheon Airport and spent a glorious few hours there. I also happened quite co incidentally to be there when a special event was being held, one that had not been held ever before. It was a re enactment of a feast day and I managed to see much of it before I had to leave.  I did not do a tour, but wandered around by myself and found it an amazing experience and if fortunate enough to return to Seoul, I'd certainly visit it again."
6036,5.0,"The name ""Gyeongbok"" translated as ""Palace Greatly Blessed by Heaven"" seems somewhat of a misnomer given that it was destroyed by fire at least twice and the scene of much murder and mayhem during the Joseon Dynasty.  All visits begin at the rebuilt front entry which leads into a wide, open courtyard. At noon, we saw the colorful changing of the guard ceremony which was accompanied by drums and horns. A not-to-be-missed event!  Along with the admission ticket, you receive a pamphlet showing the palace complex layout and details about the buildings. These should be read carefully, or the place just looks like a bunch of empty buildings, along with bridges and walls decorated with stone mythical beasts. The government has done a magnificent job restoring this treasure, except they really need to install more trash cans!  The complex deserves at least 2-3 hours, although I suspect tour guides do not give their charges that long. I'd advise wearing really comfortable shoes. There is no problem finding a taxi to elsewhere in Seoul from out front of the complex. If you walk a bit, there are many restaurants around."
6037,5.0,"I didn't do a formal tour but still loved the palace. Lots of history, beautiful grounds. Visit this if you can!"
6038,5.0,"Very conveniently located with its own subway stop this is a great place to walk around in the fall or spring when the weather is comfortable. Lots to see and plenty of space to switch your legs while admiring the amazing architecture,"
6039,3.0,"If it is a nice day, the palace is quite pleasant to walk round. If you like walking try Kings Tomb (closed on Mondays like a lot of attractions in Seoul). Kings Tomb know as Soleung in Korean is just outside of Seoul in Kyongi-do - From Gyeongbokgung it is around 30 minutes by Taxi - around $10."
6040,1.0,My friend and I walked there and then turned back around. Way too many tourists and we don't like to be associated with tourists since we like doing things out of the norm. It looked nice but it was rebuilt anyway. Plenty of other things to see and do in Seoul. Go eat some Bosintang. Yum
6041,3.0,"The palace was good to see and ironically centrally located in the middle of the city, but there is not much there other than a few of the remodeled buildings. Needs more descriptions beyond the book at the ticket counter. The changing of the guard was neat to see with the colorful dress and music."
6042,5.0,Manager to catch the changing of the guards. Not grand but provided photo opportunities. Worth visiting along with the nearby markets.
6043,4.0,"we watched the changing of the guards in front of the palace before exploring the vast grounds of this place. we liked the gazebo on the lake which is found towards the back of the grounds. we also visited two museums (with free entry) which are in the palace grounds - the national folk museum and also the national palace museum (unfortunately, not many English signs here so we did not stay long)"
6044,5.0,"Great half day experiencing aspects of life in 1300s Korea. Lots of restored or original buildings in which lived the Korean royal family.  You can pay for a audio guide which has a GPS to know where you are, which triggers audio recordings with pictures on the little PDA. It didn't work perfectly, but well enough to be very informative. Make sure you check the plug and headphones - one of the ones we had was faulty.  There are men dressed in traditional guard uniforms, who perform a ""changing of the guard"" ceremony, with flags and Korean marching instruments - well worth seeing with lots of comparisons with the equivalent in London.  There is a museum next door, but the displays are almost completely in Korean, making it hard to figure out what a lot of it is about. But for a cursory overview of Korea's history prior to the Annexation by Japan in 1910, well worth a visit."
6045,4.0,"We went on a free walking tour of this site, which is huge. We saw the changing of the guard at 10am. There are regular times for the guard changes and these are advertised. It costs 3000 won (approx. $3 AUD/US) to enter. There is a lot of walking, but all flat, except for a few steps up and down to go through each section. We went with ""Seoul City Walking Tours' with the 'Seoul Culture & Tourism Volunteer Guides"". These tours are free and have to be booked online in advance. The booking procedure is easy and you receive a confirmation email. The tours specialise in specific areas of Seoul and are not general tours. There are 17 to choose from.The guides are paid a small amount from the government and our guide would not accept a tip for his fantastic work. Tommy was our guide for our first tour, we did 3 in all. He was relatively new as a guide. He is such a lovely person. We went to very interesting places with him. Have fun as you walk and learn!"
6046,4.0,the garden and compound is so huge the lines for the entrance ticket were long great architecture  wear covered or rubber shoes as there will be a lot of walking from one palace/room to another its quite dusty in spring (i visited them in spring)
6047,4.0,"I like the decorations and the buildings, it's a very good palace. and the most amazing part is changing the guards which occurs every hour. No way to visit Seoul without visiting it."
6048,4.0,Typical palaces as in similarities to the ones in other cities like Beijing. It has a very big compound so walking end to end is quite a distance so prepare to have good walking shoes.
6049,4.0,"Wear your rubber shoes during the tour, take the afternoon english tour so it is not too hot. A bit boring after being to Beijing, Tokyo and Cambodia"
6050,4.0,"Went there on a biz trip in Jan 11. Client organized local tour which of cuz, couldn't missed out the magnificent palace. Maybe it was my first encounter with winter weather and it was freezingly cold to walk on the snow (lots and lots of walking) and I didn't get to enjoy the scenery due to the coldness. Hence, be prepared to put on heat pack and extremely thick socks with boots before going there!"
6051,5.0,I strolled through this palace. It was interesting. Well kept. Changing of the guard was very enjoyable.
6052,4.0,"Went to the Palace to get a feel of Seoul. By chance just got there as the guard was changing - it's quite a spectacle with falgs, banners and unusual uniforms - it was quite fascinating. The paalce complex is ok, a bit like a small Forbidden City and it certainly gives you the feeling of how grand it must have been"
6053,4.0,"A lovely place to spend a few hours strolling around, watch the changing of the guard and wander into the folk village. If you are over a hustle and bustle of Seoul this is a great place to come."
6054,4.0,Another well preserved palace located in the city centre.  A huge place with beautiful landscapes for photography.  Guided tours are available too at certain hours of the day.
6055,4.0,"A very good place to show Korea hundred years ago, the buildings are preserved well and impressive.  If you like to take photos definitely this is a good place to go."
6056,5.0,"A much more compact place than the Changdeogung Palace but main buidlings-wise, more or less comparable. But what sets it apart is the secret garden area which gives you a good impression of what it was like hundereds of years ago. Most buildings here are original and not rebuild as in the other places. Do take the English tour because it gives so much inside info on this attraction. A plus !"
6057,5.0,The palace is super big.... I couldn't finish exploring the palace during my one hour visit. Was too tired and had to back...
6058,4.0,"We had a great time here, largely due to an excellent tour guide who had a good sense of humour. (Though, one of the people we met who wasn't a native speaker of English found her accent difficult to understand. We personally found we could understand 90% of what she said, but English is our first language.)"
6059,4.0,"Wear comfortable walking shoes and bring a bottle of water. Be prepared for the often dusty areas paved with gravel. There are many steps to climb without handrails in order to see inside many of the palace rooms. Allow time to do a guided walking tour with English speaking tour guides. There's a sign at the gathering place inside the palace grounds for the scheduled tours, which are free.  Please read the other reviews of this palace. I agree with most of them, and don't want to repeat."
6060,3.0,"We arrived at Gyeongbokgung Palace around lunch time, it was very hot and too much glare from the sun. Maybe its better to go in the afternoon and in time for the English-speaking tour guide but there are free English booklets that you can read while walking around the palace.  There is also the Gogungddurak museum shop and cafe where we had our lunch."
6061,4.0,"The palace itself and surrounding are beautiful, but in my opinion the park behind is beautiful, with artifitial lake and great deep green. Try to get on late afternoon, when sun starts to set down and enjoy great play of colors"
6062,5.0,"Impressive architecture with the National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum on the grounds as well. Time your visit to witness the changing of the guard and be sure to see the gardens in the rear of the palace, especially the lovely Hyangwonjeong pavilion. The combination ticket for all the palaces in Seoul, including the Secret Garden and Jongmyo Shrine is well worth it if you plan on seeing more than 3 of the sites."
6063,4.0,There is free hanbok wearing at the souvenir shop which was such a memorable experience! Each person has only 10 minutes to wear the hanbok as the line gets pretty much long. I suggest you go and patiently wait in front of the souvenir shop at lunch time (like what we did) so you get to be first in line when they open up. Ask someone to take your photo standing in front of the nearest palace so you have a great background.
6064,4.0,"This is the one of the place you need to visit when your holidays in South Korea.You can explore by yourself and it take 2 to 3 hrs to complete this area. The entrance fees is around 2,400 Won.You can bring along bottle of drinks and cap if you visit summer season as the place is big for your to explore where you can snap beautiful view either the traditional palaces or lake.You also can try their traditional dress for snap photos with free fees. The best is when you arrive in you can see the changing guard with some of traditional music. We also can snap photos with the guard when they are on duty.Please don't miss this place in your holidays itinarary."
6065,5.0,Beautiful and very nicely programmed in the summer. Took out of town guests there on the weekend and the museum was free. It was a delight to see all the extra performances.
6066,4.0,it's big so wear comfy shoes and a fan may be helpful in the summer as Seoul can get incredibly humid. Though this is one attraction not to miss while in Seoul.
6067,4.0,"If you are in Seoul, this is a must see. Try to get a guide if possible. You probably need about 1 hour here maybe an hour and a half. You will get some nice photos. Try to time it so you see the changing of the guard. This area is bigger than you think so keep walking and move around or you will end up being here longer than you need to."
6068,2.0,"A place where you do strolls, sit for a chat, enjoy the scenery, take pictures of the guards and... thats about all. The buildings and structures are not sophiscated and are quite plain. The place is well.. relatively big but there aint many artifacts. There is not much to explore and the history is not as rich. It projects itself more of a location for movie/TV makers rather than a palace with history. Quite disappointed as reviews say this is the best palace in Seoul."
6069,3.0,Perhaps we have seen the forbidden city and temple of heaven in Beijing so our expectations may be high. Also it was rebuild so may not have the same feel. However. the translation equipment was great to use. We advise tourist to pay tthe 3000 cos you really can understand the history. The changing guards was also a good thing to watch. We caught this at the right time so it was really good.
6070,5.0,All visitors to Seoul should stop by this palace. Very amazed by the grandeur of the structures and the beauty of the architecture. Be sure to come on a cooler day as we visited during a heat wave and found ourselves dripping with sweat. Also do not make the mistake of spending too much time at the main gate and the first palace building as it is only a small part of the overall complex.
6071,4.0,"I first visited Gyeongbok Palace in 1968 and have gone back periodically since then. It is always more enjoyable with each successive visit. Archaeological excavations are constantly going on, and buildings that had been destroyed are gradually being restored. The military unit that used to occupy the rear part of the palace near the Blue House is gone and now that part of the palace is accessible as well. There are guided tours and self guided options as well. Being interested in history and old buildings, I have found that it is impossible to see all there is to see in one short visit. Be prepared to walk: it's quite an extensive complex. I used to prefer Changdok Palace/Secret Garden as my go-to palace in Seoul. That may still be the case, bu Kyongbok palace is giving it a run for the money."
6072,5.0,"Wow, just wow..the place is so big, so beautiful, it draws you back in time, come at 12 noon, there are guards exchange ceremony, for those who came for a photo time, the best time to do it is at that convenient hour."
6073,5.0,Get amazed with the uniqueness of Seoul - a well preserved ancient palace in the middle of the metropolitan city. It's amazing how these two sentiments blend together.
6074,4.0,The palace is completely rebuilt and it is worth a visit to understand Seoul's past. There is a great guards ceremony every our in the main entrance
6075,5.0,Loved the palace and worth visiting. definitely go there and its not far from the city centre. I took tons of pictures here which i enjoy doing. At the entrance the guards are all dressed up in traditional old uniforms which was nice to see.
6076,4.0,"Been here twice and still think that's this is the most interesting attraction in Seoul, other then the shopping. The place will take u back to the olden days in Korea. It would be great if u can get a guide to explain the features within this palace to get a better understanding."
6077,4.0,"this will likely be the first place you go to as a ""sight"" in Seoul. In terms of the colours of painting/decoration it is certainly distinctive and different from anything else you will find elsewhere in the world, other than Korea. It is somewhat like the Forbidden City in Beijing in terms of the size of the site (not as big though) and it will take half a day to get around. I happened to catch the palace guard parade thing more or less by accident so worth timing it for that (1pm?)."
6078,3.0,"Great history of the palace but extensive walking to get to each building. We arrived on a hot, humid day and gave up before we say everything. But the free brochure explains each building and the history quite well."
6079,5.0,"I love visiting palaces. If you like watching korean epic dramas, you could relate on the drama scenes by seeing the palaces. The changing of guards is very colourful too"
6080,5.0,"Despite all the modern advancement of the towns near Gyeongbokgung Palace, this place will never shed its beautiful history. The palace, though standing for centuries, has retained its beauty - from the 5 colors that symbolized korean culture to the detailed structures it has - all perfect and amazing as of this moment."
6081,4.0,"I grew up in Korea and was at the Palace about 15 years ago. I remember it to be one boring trip then, since I lived in Seoul.  Two days ago I visited the Palace with a friend from Japan. The Palace was nicely presented, although rather crowded with tourists.  Make sure to check out both new and old museums. Also make sure to visit in the morning around 10am to see traditional Korean music and guards!"
6082,3.0,"One sparsely adorned pavilion after another. No tree cover at all; it is scorching hot under the summer sun. If you don't want to expand the energy or have limited time, skip this tourist trap."
6083,5.0,"The relocation of the water mill grounder, authentic traditional house, totem poles, etc are truly appreciated. There's no better way to visualize the way of life the Korean."
6084,4.0,"It reminds me of the forbidden city palace in Brijing, but much smaller. The museum inside the palace is very nice."
6085,3.0,"The changing of the guards is worth seeing. It takes place in a massive empty square and the guards move around it, so you get good views of the whole thing. It's very colourful and makes for good pictures. Besides that, there is not much else to see besides the buildings, and the main gate."
6086,4.0,"A very interesting Palace that was built more than five hundred years ago, although it was once destroyed by fire that took many years to rebuild near to its original state. A huge Palace with lots of history in it."
6087,4.0,"it is not to compear the palaces in China, but it is nice. Not much crowed and can be visited easily in half day. Tha guide lady was very nice."
6088,5.0,The famous palace here... A must see for every tourist! Vast area inside... I wonder how many servants the King has inside the palace grounds!?!?!
6089,4.0,"Really beautiful. Not as organized at Changdeokgung, but the architecture is magnificent. Be sure to catch the changing of the guards"
6090,5.0,"Don't miss it, after going here I doubt you'll need to go to another palace in Korea. The place is impeccable and the maintenance is great."
6091,5.0,"If I have to compare, I would prefer Deoksugung Palace than Gyeongbokgung palace to visit during holiday. Why? Gyeongbokgung is too crowded since it's the main center of the palace to be visited by the tourists. The main attraction would be the changing of the guards, the history of the palace, the national folk museum and the national museum.  However the last time I came here I can't enjoy it that much since it's very crowded with people. Even the pictures that I took were not as beautiful as ones I took at Deoksugung. Perhaps, one suggestion, come to Gyeongbokgung during weekdays, and not in a spring, winter, or summer break. People are coming not only from Seoul but also China and Japan. I really find it unattractive in a huge commotion like that.  Nevertheless, for 3000won, this area is really worth to visit. This palace area is so huge that even 3 hours will last like a flash. And make sure, you're not coming during holiday. It'll be an awful experience.You can't really enjoy the scenery since it's too noisy and crowded."
6092,4.0,"We went to se the colourful changing of the guard, on the hour from 11 am but check times and days that it happens. We did not pay to go inside the palace, preferring to go nextdoor to the National Folk Museum which is free and very good."
6093,4.0,"I got here just in time to see one of the changing of the guard ceremonies, which I thought was a hoot. Architecture is my main attraction at such places, so seeing the outside and the courtyard was enough for me, so I didn't pay to go inside."
6094,3.0,All I can remember is it was sooooo hot and burning hot it was. Best not to go in the hot hot summer. There is nothing much inside well compare to the Forbbiten city in China. There is free custom photos though and you can go out to the musem for free and get back in. On special days if you wear the triditional clothes you can get in for free. Ticket price 3000 Won
6095,5.0,Elaborate palace but sadly the present version is mostly reconstruction after dismantling during the Japanese occupation. Be sure to catch a view of the Blue House by exiting at the rear gate.
6096,5.0,"This was worth stopping by to see! We had a 10 hour layover in Seoul on our way to Beijing. We didn't have enough time to see every single thing here but it was still worth it! You can get here either by taking a bus or by going via the metro/subway!  Take lots of pictures! Bring comfortable shoes! Take pictures with the ""soldiers"" up front!"
6097,4.0,This palace is beautifully restored and a popular attraction for locals and foreigners alike. Well worth the time. Get the audio tour!
6098,3.0,"We arrived at Gyeongbokgung palace early in the morning as we wanted to get in as it opened and hopefully avoid the big crowds. When the doors opened we were surprised to see a large number of tourists already on the grounds. It turns out there is another set of doors that apparently opened before the front doors. This place gets very busy very quickly, oh well, such is life with major tourist attractions in big cities :)  The architecture of the palace is exquisite. The blossoms were in full bloom so it made for a very picturesque settings. We spent several hours walking around the grounds (some spots are off limits as they reconstruct areas) and we were even able to find a few quiet spots to relax. I highly suggest going to the Folk Museum as it really gives a nice view into ancient Korean life.  On our way out we were fortunate to catch a guard show. The entrances are guarded by actors(?) dressed in traditional Korean attire (they even have fake beards to look the part!) They performed a choreographed march for about 10 minutes. I assume they do this throughout the day so hopefully you happen to be there at the right time.  This isn't the most amazing palace that i've been to but it was definitely worth going to. A must see when visiting Seoul."
6099,4.0,"Lot's to see here, architecture, culture, history... the grounds are well maintained, and there are lots of areas to sit and relax and soak up the surroundings and history. Definately worth a visit if you are in Seoul. It's a shame the locals in Seoul are so rude, I will never return to Seoul or South Korea."
6100,4.0,"Not necessarily my type of thing but if you are in S Korea for a couple of days then you shoudl allow time to visit, inexpensive and won't take too long. Make sure you go to the front of the palace and see the soldiers."
6101,5.0,"Although Gyeongbokgung Palace is rebuilt after the wars, the new comes with its advantages. The whole place is well thought out.  Stepping off the subway, the stone lined Gyeongbokgung subway station bring visitors centeries back preparing them for a palace visit. Steps outside the subway exit, ticketing booths are easy to spot. Remember to keep the ticket stub because you will need this to re-enter the palace after exiting for the Blue House and the Folk Museum.  Upon entrance, information desk is on the right where one can obtain brochuer and map in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese. Tours are available in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese. Royal guard changing ceremony occure on the hour. English tours at 11AM, 13:30PM, and 15:30PM. I joint the english tour which lasted 65 minutes. The tour ended on the north. After the tour, I exited the north gate and took photo of the Blue House Cheongwadae. Coming back to the palace requires ticket stub. On the way back to the entrance, I exited the east gate to check out the Folk Museum. Again, entering the Folk Museum and coming back to the palace requires ticket stub. After a relaxing walk back to the entrance, just in time for the Royal Guard changing ceremony.  The two hour walk was not very demanding. There are also handicap access throughout the palace. However, most path are pavers which are not heels or slipper friendly. I saw young visitors exhausted so this may not be a very excited place for the very young. Those may need a lift of spirit at the Lotte world.  I strongly recommend the tour and reading up the guidebook. It's a very relaxing tour and the guidebook is short and sweet. The Korean government did a great job and made the palace visit relaxing and stress free."
6102,5.0,went to visit Gyeongbokgung palace on 11 July and very amazed. The palace is linked from the subway station. It situated in front of modern roads and buildings. The changing of guards ceremony is a highlight of the attraction. It's very colourful and such an eye-opener to see a traditional ceremony in front of a modern street. The palace is huge and all architecture looks the same inside. Nevertheless it was very worth the visit.
6103,4.0,It was nice to visit this place again because they are well managed and was kept very clean. Very similar architecture with china's Forbidden City.
6104,5.0,"The Palace is very big, and nice to walk around. While you can find the performance schedule of 'changing soldiers' every day. Very impressive performance - you will see the soldiers wearing Korean traditional costumes marching with Korean music, and at the end of the performance, you can take photos with the soldiers!!"
6105,5.0,the changing of the guards is what makes this palace different from other palaces. very colourful
6106,4.0,"very huge, so huge that you could get lost, entrance was also very cheap, nice place to learn about korea"
6107,5.0,"This is my favorite of all the palaces in Seoul! The buildings are beautiful...there is so much to see. The changing of the guard ceremony is something not to be missed. My favorite spot is the small pond in the way back of the grounds.(Hyangwon-jeong) The day we were there, there we lilly pads in the pod. The pictures we took of the pond, gazebo and mountain in the background were breathtaking!"
6108,3.0,"It was very interesting to see the palace. It was very spacious with plenty of colour and unique architecture. It was kind of disappointing to hear that the entire palace was burned multiple times during the Japanese Occupation and again during the Korean war. Even though none of the buildings are original, it was nice to see how the palace would have looked during its prime. I would definitely recommend a visit as it is a major attraction in the city."
6109,4.0,"Although all the palaces in Seoul have been rebuilt after 20th century devastation, they are worth visiting to get a feel for the history of the city. They are cheap to enter and have great free brochures about the buildings and the past."
6110,3.0,"This place is refurbished, so a lot of buildings aren't original. Is easy to get to the place but if it's a rainy day you could have some difficulties because most of the place is outdoors. This is one of the highlights of the city, so you should go."
6111,4.0,Very interesting and beautiful to see the architecture! but also very big
6112,4.0,"Just seeing and hearing, through the tour guide, how the Korean people lived and were governed during the 16 and 17 hundreds made the trip to the palace worth it. Also the palace is connected to the Korean cultural center which was very interesting."
6113,5.0,I used the tour guide recommended by the Hotel. Amazing value for money. Strongly recommend it.
6114,4.0,"It was my first time there, so it could have been better to have clear path to go around the palace for tourists, but it is nice sight to visit though. I wish i had more time to visit thoroughly."
6115,4.0,"the buildings are well preserved. and if you are lucky, you get to take photos with the guards of the palace too!"
6116,5.0,I was blown away by the palace restoration and artwork. It is a prime example of Korea's past. There were palace guard re-enactments to transport you back in time. A must see for any visitor in Seoul.
6117,5.0,"This place is huge! And it was hot, so I recommend going as early in the day as possible. There is a museum out the back side as well, and they have a special children's section. We saw Korean school children on fieldtrips. It was fun."
6118,4.0,This is big suggest you have a guided tour so that everything is explained. Get there so you can enjoy the Changing of the Guard ceremony which is very colourful {11am each morning}. The Folklore museum excellent so just give yourself plenty of time and be prepared for the crowds!
6119,4.0,Liked - the history and buildings - very cheap to visit
6120,4.0,"This Palace lies in the center of Seoul and is surrounded by busy roads. It is very cheap to enter and the buildings are pretty and well maintained. It is a very busy attraction, I cannot stress this enough! You may well have to line-up to see inside a building or take photos. Try and time your visit to coincide with the changing of the guard ceremony."
6121,5.0,Went with a local tour guide and enjoye all the explaination of the history of the Palace. So big. Never knew the King had so many wifes ! hihi
6122,5.0,"This place is LARGE and is getting larger. Its been razed by the Japanese in the past and has been rebuilt (and is still being rebuilt) but its a journey into a significant part of Korea's history. English speaking guides are available and are very helpful in order to appreciate the significance and function of the court dynasty that used this as its central palace for state affairs. Although school kids are here by the hundreds on field trips, the size of the palace grounds is so great that you can find yourself alone in a side courtyard in quiet. The restoration is wonderful with great attention to detail. Some of the recaptured landscaping offers aesthetic perspectives that convey an earlier age and culture worlds away from the frantic pace of Seoul just a few hundred yards away. The walled enclosure really leaves modern Seoul feeling far away. Its an inexpensive ticket and one can easily spend a couple of hours here."
6123,4.0,"One of three palaces we visited in Seoul. Beautiful architecture, rich history and lots of knowledge imparted whilst touring the palace.  We entered the palace grounds directly from the station. The station walkway to the palace itself was amazing as it was themed as a palace. The palace is enormous with so many different chambers and grounds. My favourite section was the structure surrounded by a mout. We were there on an icy Korean day, so the mout was frozen up. The palace also has a curio shop and oppposite the shop you can dress up in tradional Korean attire and take photos. The curio shop is very good and we found some excellent gifts there at very good prices - this is Seoul after all and stuff is not cheap but this shop was very well priced so say the least. There is also an excellent western restaurant at the palace, which sells slightly different meals and has a nice arty feel about it. The restaurant itself also has a large curio shop and you can find good books, puzzles, fans, cufflinks etc at very good prices there.  Well worth a visit - this is Seoul - a city that promotes arts and culture."
6124,5.0,"This palace, and its neighbor to the East, is beautifully restored and well worth visiting. You can enter some of the buildings.  Recommended: Take a free, guided tour, either from the Palace (times posted upon entry) or by reserving one at the Korean Tourist Agency (http://www.visitseoul.net/).  Hidden treat: National Folk Museum of Korea is at the NE corner of the palace, and is excellent, with free guided tours."
6125,3.0,"I guess the palace look quite like a lot of other asian palaces. Most of it is not original, but restored or (more often) rebuilt. It's a place you should visite if you're in Seoul, but don't expect too much. The most charming area is at the back of the garden - a little pond with a hexagonal pavillion."
6126,4.0,"If you are to take Seoul's subway line number 3 to the Gyeobokgung station, you'll be mesmerized by the artistic subway columns promoting Korea's cultural artcrafts. Taking exit number 5, you will see South Korea's grandest palace. Although it was a rainy day during my tour, I still opted to catch the 11 o'clock English tour and learn the rich history of the country. Perhaps I am indeed a big fan of fairy tales and kingdoms the reason why I was so attentive with what the tour guide says ^_^. The most romantic part of the place was the Hyangwonji Pond and the Hyangwonjeong Pavilion. I did make sure to see and visit the site as this was filming location of the first appearance of Kim Soo Hyun in the famous drama, ""The Moon That Embraces the Sun"".  After the palace tour, the ticket may still be used if you wish to visit the National Folk Art Museum at the back of the Palace or have a glimpse of the Blue House (Korea's presidential house).  The cold wind that almost blew my umbrella and the pouring rain didn't matter. It was still an amazing tour. Hope to visit again on a fair weather."
6127,4.0,"The palace is pretty big, though once you have visited one palace, the rest looks pretty much similiar. Though they tell a different story. And so a guided tour helps or the guide booklet that is made available at the palance entrance. There are various activites that happens within the grounds of the palace. Depending on the time of the day, you will be able to experience the changing of guards at the entrance of the palace. There are some family oriented activities available within the palace vicinity as well.  The amazing thing about the palace is that it sits beautifully against Mount Namsan and the Han River."
6128,5.0,Wow to think of how this is so magnificent even now. I love the colors. How sad that it was burned down by the Japanese. See the palace where the last queen and king were assassinated.
6129,5.0,"This palace is immensely huge, or rather, the grounds are. The buildings are placed around the grounds and signs showing which building belonged to who are easily accessible and clearly marked. You can easily spend half a day here just walking around and taking it all in. The buildings are well preserved, the paint and colours glorious and bright. You can enter one building if you take your shoes off and leave them outside, this gives you the chance to get a closer look at how te Royal Family lived, but the sign with the overview was severly lacking here, sporting titles such as ""a lamp""... I would have preferred a brief history or something like that.  Depending on he timing, you can catch the changing of the gard at the entrance, definitely worth it. I caught this by sheer luck and was pleasantly surprised. Very colourful, very ""old, Asian film"".  The museum is also absolutely worth a look. It shows the history of Korea and the traditions of its people, very educational and entertaining.  Outside the museum is a circle with sculptures of all the animals of the Chinese horoscope, excellent touristy photo opportunity ;-)  The museum has air conditioning, but the rest is outdoors, prepare sun lotion, hats and water if you're going!  Kafeteria and shop is just outside the entrance. Neat tip: if you want to send cards, you can buy both cards and stamps here AND send them from here. The staff will show you."
6130,3.0,"Nice touch of Korean history walking the grounds. Nestled in the heart of Seoul, this is very accessible. But it is not on the scale of the Forbidden City - and definitely worth visiting. There were the colourful guards marching around and they even wandered off into the business district outside the palace walls. Nice sight."
6131,4.0,"This place is larger than I had imagined, but it is quite the place to see. The museum is also attached to the grounds. The changing of the guards is quite th scene."
6132,4.0,This is the biggest of all the palaces and the most well-preserved.
6133,5.0,"The changing of the guard was enjoyable. The museum is also worth taking in and walking around the ground, is a nice way of spending an afternoon."
6134,4.0,"This palace can be covered in much less time, but I spent about 5 hours exploring. Took the free English Tour which leaves from the Information office at designated times. Tour guide was impossibly nice, but a little hard to understand. Still, she tried very hard to make sure we got the gist of what she was trying to say. My tour group at the peak of the day was only about 15 people which was a nice size. The tour took about an hour and she did provide a few minutes here and there for us to linger.  I also bought for 3000 Won, an audio tour (right next to where you buy your tickets). I do recommend this as it provided a good number of additional tidbits that the guidebook and tour did not. It is also on a GPS so the audio/video clips just start playing as soon as you come up to a landmark. So after my guided tour, I doubled back and visited most of the places again with my audio guide. Try to time it for the changing of the guards. Not as spectacular as some I've seen in other countries, but certainly worth checking out.  I ventured out to get a better look at the Blue House (out the back gate, just make sure you have your ticket for re-entry), but did not have time for the Folk Museum which you can also access from the side of Gyeongbokgung. Make sure you have plenty of water and food if you need it, with you if you're visiting in the summer months. There is only one cafe at which to buy food & drink and it is located towards the front. There are large circular drinking fountains if you're not picky, though these are more 'faucet like' so folks do 'wash' in these too. I saw them cleaned frequently though.  I was surprised at how precarious many of the spots were - you have to climb to most of the buildings on rather tall stone steps. The ground is stone paved in many places and the stones are roughly hewn and you can easily trip. Just be aware if you're planning to go with anyone with mobility issues or young children.  I took the subway to get here. Get to Gwanghwamun station and there will be signs and maps that lead you to Gyeongbokgung. It was an easy 5 minute walk straight ahead from the exit that I took.  The only thing to realize is this palace has been completely restored from the ground up after it was razed by war and fire, so it is all a 'replica' if you will, if you are a real stickler for that. That aside, I think it is well worth at least a couple of hours visit."
6135,4.0,touristy guard change during the guard but well worth getting a photo of
6136,4.0,"Yes, this palace has been reconstructed but the innovative South Koreans had no alternative if they wanted to rightly showcase their proud history.  The guards at the main gate were incredibly still as tourists posed beside them.  The 1100 changing of the guard was impressive: much music amid solemn ceremony and marching.  The Palace's reconstructed buildings occupy a large area. Reconstruction is ongoing with some traditional cottages being built.  The entrance fee (KRW3000 was particularly good value). One can combine this with a visit to the free National Folk Museum.  Don't come on Tuesdays: it is closed."
6137,4.0,"One of several major palaces in downtown Seoul; once you've had a guided tour of one you will recognize the main features of the others. I'd avoid the audio tour for this one, though; the equipment is very temperamental and the sound keeps cutting out."
6138,4.0,A must-visit for first time Seoul visitors. Provides tourists with a glimpse of historical Korea. Get the combined tickets for all the palaces (costs 10000 KRW)
6139,1.0,"Ok, it had been a long flight and I was tired, hot and dehydrated. I'd also taken a wrong turn and gone in the wrong direction for a while, so when I got to the complex I was a bit grumpy. It looks beautiful, a bit like how I imagine the Imperial Palace looks in Beijing, but I then made the mistake of taking a free booklet describing the complex.. although it was first built in 1395 it burned down in 1592 and waited 275 years to be rebuilt only to be largely destroyed by fire again less than a decade later. Rebuilt again, it was pulled down in 1915 and in 1926 the Palace area was severely disfigured by the construction of a colonial building. Rebuilding began in 1990. So that was it - the whole lot was no more than 20 years old. Indeed if you look at the edges you can see the construction ongoing. All well and good, but rather disappointing. I have underwear older than that! I consoled myself by imagining the complex as a model, with me shrunk down to size. (C'mon, how many of you have looked at a really good model and NOT ever hought that?) But even that was little consolation - the reconstruction wan't accurate - the guide booklet admits that three buildings in the inner part originally had a hall joining them - so why rebuild them without it? And an island further along originally had access to the north - so why rebuild it to the south? Mind you it is a moot point, because the complex could more accurately be renamed the Do Not Enter Palace. Wherever there was the danger of actually seeing something interesting, a rope hung in front of you with a Do Not Enter sign and the occasion guard sitting around reading a paper. Why? What 20 year old thing am I going to ruin? And why close 90% of the doors and windows? Are the insides not accurate? Are they just storage for wheelbarrows? Why build a complex at all if not to open it up and show it off? I could understand it if it were 500 years old, but 20, no. The one place I really fancied a look around was a reception hall built on a lake. You could see it from the edge of the lake but the doors in the wall were firmly shut. When, at 10am, I saw 5 people being let in I thought my luck had changed, but I wasn't allowed through. The guard pointed out a sign (in Korean) that had a website on it (sorry, I didn't make a note) and said I had to make a reservation. Again, why? So their 20 year old building wouldn't get visitors? Nowhere did I see any indication that you could book, indeed had to book, in order to get inside, not even in the official booklet. And how frustrating it is to find one of the better areas off limits because my ESP powers were off that day and I hadn't guessed I had to book ahead. Totally frustrating, and frankly, they could do with a weedsprayer for some of the main areas and a gardner to turn the weed patch that is the ""beautiful terraced garden"" into what it should be. Cute squirrels though.."
6140,5.0,Easy to get to by the subway - Gwanghwamun Station on Line 5. You walk out the station and there is a statue of King Sejong- past the statue is the Palace with the guards in uniform. Worth visiting for a look at a bygone era and existence.
6141,4.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is close to the city center is thus the most frequented by tour groups. Visit early in the morning to avoid the crowds. The National Folk Museum of Korea is connected to the complex, so visit this as well when you're in the area."
6142,4.0,Loved the changing of the guards! Afterwards we were invited to take pictures with the guards who were very patient with the many tourists.
6143,5.0,Great view into Korean history. Do the self guided audio tour or join a live tour. Well worth it.
6144,4.0,"Compared to the palaces in Beijing, Gyeongbokgung Palace are not that impressive as a whole. But there are some interesting parts in the palace that are awe-inspiring. Its big moat in the middle of the palace & the changing of the guards are just a few of it."
6145,4.0,"the palace is intersting to visit if you would like to see one of the Korean palaces. However, the palace is not original and has been rebuilt recently, which explains the good quality and freshness of the painting."
6146,5.0,"I've heard people say that if you've been to Beijing, Seoul palaces are not that impressive. Well, I haven't been to Beijing so I don't know if that's true but I really, really loved Gyeongbok Palace. Get the audio guide so you understand what each building was for. It's a pretty emotional experience, knowing the royal family is gone.  You can spend more than half a day here because the National Folk Museum and National Palace Museum are here.  Check out the changing of the guard!"
6147,5.0,"This is the prettiest palace in Seoul, for sure! Go there in the morning, when no one else is around. If there's a snowfall, you'll get beautiful pictures of the rooftops and park. There is also a great folk museum there, for those who don't have time to go to Yongin."
6148,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace (景福宮)... the most Beautiful Palace ever !! Myself and with 6 other of my girl-friends are first time visit palace. We manage watching the colourful changing of the guards on time at around 10am and walked around for about 2 hours.  Admission Fees : Adults 3000 won (Closed on Tuesday)  getting there by subway : 1. Use exit #5 of Gyeongbokgung Station (Subway Line #3), 2. From Exit #2 of Ganghwamun Station (Subway Line #5), walk 400 meters"
6149,4.0,The guard changning in front of the palace is scheduled hourly from 10 am to 3 pm. I watched 10 am round and it's enjoyable especially when I was trying to take picture. I also had a chance to watch 3 pm round as well since I was still in the area. The routine is definely different from 10 am round and it's also shorter. My recommend'd be go for the 10 am round. Gyeongbokgung itself is pretty to an eye. It's a great spot to picture (day dreaming in my case) of how people in earlier era live.
6150,4.0,"Many explanations are written in Korean, and little in English. Toilets are not commonly found within the compound either.  However, exhibits are openly displayed for good viewing. The exhibits are also very well maintained too."
6151,5.0,One of the most beautiful palaces in Seoul (Go for this one if you had to visit only one).  The changing of the guards which occurs at 2:00 pm is worth watching.  Take some documentation / map about the palace to understand the history of the place.
6152,5.0,"Loved the palace, history and culture! We watched the changing of the guards and walked the grounds for a couple of hours. The national folk museum is on the property and has free admission."
6153,4.0,"Changing of the Guards every hour on the hour, ending at 3PM. It's a must see. Wear comfortable shoes and take lots of pictures."
6154,3.0,"One of five palaces in Seoul, it has been fully restored. It's a large fenced complex with many different buildings. Most of the buildings cannot be entered, but some, including the throne room, have the doors open so you can see inside. Do take the video tour, it has a built in GPS so the narration automatically starts as you approach each viewing point. The changing of the guards, every hour on the hour, is colourful and worth seeing. My favourite parts were the stone animal statues and the large pavilion set in the water.  Probably not interesting to small children as there's a lot of walking and not much to do."
6155,5.0,"I made it just in time for the free English tour, and followed our guide around for a couple of hours. I really enjoyed learning about the history of the palace from 1395 all the way to the present. Of course, a tour in this area isn't a tour without a good ten minutes hearing about King Sejong :) but overall, I loved it. And the palace is BIG, so wear your walking shoes. My puppies hurt after running around this place!"
6156,4.0,"The palace is a very tranquil place set amongst a bustling city, it was very interesting and gave a good insight into Korean history"
6157,4.0,the changing of the guards ceremony was interesting. would have been better if there was some sort of english version so visitors could understand what was going on.
6158,5.0,It seems like they have a lot of students going there for field trips
6159,4.0,"good to visit this palace and with the map and discription, you know the history of korea a lot. i recommend to exist on the west side and go for ginsing chicken for lunch and use the same ticket to resume the visit after. since the famous restaurant is right at the west side exist."
6160,4.0,Very Big palace so be prepared to walk. The change of guard ceremony is nice to watch. Only thing that was not so nice is the dust in that place. Either beause of the number of people who visit or since the historic site is historic large area is plain ground. What is beautiful is the various carvings of animals and the one that is breath taking is the throne. Pls plan to first thing in the morning as dust & heat combination in the noon would be difficult to handle
6161,4.0,"Beautiful. Make sure to walk around the whole area, which has fabulous gardens."
6162,5.0,"We were there around 2pm, and we were able to watch the changing of the guards. It took around 15 minutes, and guests can go up close to take photos or videos. There are no barriers so you can feel free to take photos.  The palace itself is big and beautiful. We feel this is the most beautiful one of the palaces."
6163,5.0,"It is a huge palace complex that you can wander around. It's a great way to spend a nice afternoon outside. If you are visiting, to see some well maintained or restored traditional palace buildings. I would say it is a definite must to see at least one of the palaces if you are visiting South Korea. For those that live here, you should have been to one by now."
6164,4.0,Get the schedule for the ceremony from the Korean website and go watch! It is amazing to watch the guards continue to perform this tradition.
6165,5.0,"Changing of the guards, the history and architecture, the gardens and the surrounding mountains all within the modern city of Seoul"
6166,4.0,"amazing. i went to this and i went to the palace in beijin, this one is a lot more pleasent. clean with nice architecture and lake inside."
6167,4.0,I had a blast and learned so much on this trip. The buildings are breathtaking and the it was weird because it was smack in the middle of a highly populated area but it was quiet... The colors on and in the building were beautiful. I truly had fun. I love learning about South Korea's culture and history.
6168,4.0,"I'm not a history or culture enthusiast, but visiting Seoul is not complete if you dont visit all those palaces. It's nice because it was my first timer, what you expect will be the colourful unique designs. Excellent for photo taking and memorable photo of Seoul trip. nothing much to see and expect on the changing of guard , just a procession with colourful guard marching and playing traditional musical instruments. easily accessible by subways (Gwanghamon or Geongbukgung st)."
6169,5.0,"Absolutely stunning and a must see. You can make your way around the palace and the surrounding neighborhood on foot an enjoy the splendor. Reasonably priced at 3,000 won Try the follk museum too it's free"
6170,4.0,"great for learning about korean culture, architecture is nice too. it is massive, so recommend visiting when youve got some energy!"
6171,5.0,"I along with my friend had a nice trip around the Seoul. We enjoyed it very much. For me it was like a dream to observe the Korean Traditions, History and culture, wearing Korean traditional, dress I felt myself a Character of King Sejong, the great.  I personally think we should preserve and promote our history and culture for the upcoming generations and the organizations like Touch Korea Tour are doing this in a remarkable way here in Korea. The visit of the National Museum of Korea introduce us to the culture of Korea, the seasons, bridal, birth and funeral ceremonies, music instruments and all that was very unique to us. It also gives us comparison of various ages of empowerment and emperors in Korea. It also tells a clear story of the downfall and rise of Korea. Our guide Sunny Park while explaining all the history of Gyeongbok palace created such an environment and interest that I felt myself to be a part of that era. She explained us the in detail about the various parts of palace and the ruling situation of various emperor. Indeed she proved herself a kind and competent resource person. It was very interesting and romantic to visit the Historical Street behind the palace. The Combination of modern and ancient culture of Korean Society was awesome. I recommend every visitor to visit Gyeongbok palace if you wana explore the real culture and tradition of Korea."
6172,4.0,"Good for learning Korean culture for those who is very curious and interested but to some it will be boring and tiring. When I went there, a ceremonial parade was taken place where there are Koreans who wear hanbok so we took a lot of pictures, you'll see different kind of old building of Korean Monarchy."
6173,4.0,History of the Royal family during that era.The way they lived in such huge grounds.To cover it 2hours plus was not enough time The high light was the changing of the Royal Guards very spectacular.
6174,3.0,"Worth a visit, probably good idea to have a guide."
6175,4.0,absolutely worth a visit make sure you are there when they have the changing of the guard ceremony in the traditional costumes. very colourfull
6176,4.0,"Located in the heart of downtown Seoul, the Gyeonbokgung palace is a must. Not only are tickets dirt cheap, you can also gain access to multiple different sites including the neighboring palace, and the Folk Museum.  Beware though. The palace is closed on Tuesdays. Always check on the website to make sure they are open as they tend to close it down for various reasons."
6177,5.0,Variety of very good museums and very well restored palace buildings.
6178,5.0,Lots of excellent examples of ancient Korean palace architecture and life. Good for a walk around. Definitely worth the money.
6179,4.0,"This palace is a great place to visit to get a glimpse of Korea's history. Definitely get an audio guide if you do not take a guided tour. Without the background information, you are likely to miss out on a lot of key facts."
6180,4.0,"This was a great half day trip. The history was interesting, the grounds are nice and inside is the folk museum. If the weather is nice, take a picnic."
6181,2.0,"If you have seen any European, Chinese, or Japanese palaces/temples, this will be a bit of a let down. The architecture is nice enough, but there very little interest-holding power here. Nicest thing about the place is the mountains in the background.  Thronging with tourists as well, not a MUST SEE if I'm honest."
6182,5.0,"Ponds, nooks, crannies, pavillions, surprises, ....its all here. The changing of the guard is quite a ceremony so don't miss it. Check with tourist office(s) to find out the daily schedule (depends on time of year of visit)."
6183,5.0,"If you are short on time, and only have one palace to visit while you are in Seoul. I really recommend Gyeongbokgung Palace to be your pick. It has an extensive ground. They layout is great and easy to navigate through and the buildings are so beautiful. I was just in time to see the cherry blossoms still in bloom. It is a beautiful and serene place. A must see on my list of things to see while you are in Korea."
6184,4.0,"get ready to walk around into the traditional houses and around the little lakes they have in this complex. and all the while, catch a small glimpse of how life is during the Joseon dynasty. love the atmosphere and wonderful view during the spring- and winter too."
6185,4.0,"The greatest and earliest of the Five Grand Palaces constructed during Joseon Dynasty dated back to the 14th century, Gyeongbokgung Palace is worth a stroll to those who explore Seoul for its culture and history. Being restored after ruins by time and wars, the Chinese-look-alike palace is sizeable enough to hold your stay up to half a day or more by its hordes of halls, courts, pavilions and royal quarters.  Come early around 9 am to witness a royal parade before finding yourself passing through regal passages which lead to 5 outer courts (used to serve administration affairs including the Throne Hall), 3 inner courts (private residences of King, Queen and His Mother) and Donggung (the Palace of the Crowned Prince). Somehow, the most radiant shall be 2 pavilions in the backyard and of which, the Hyangwonjeong pavilion on a small island is the most photographed.  What is more, the environs of the Palace may excite you as well. The next door Museum of free entrance with a recreational exhibition of ancient Korea readies to expose more about the history of the dynamic country. A wee further is a food street packed with restaurants and coffeehouses of all ranges and cuisines. Also, it takes 15 minutes on foot to reach Jogye Temple, one the most important Buddhist temple in Seoul and its nearby shopping street. Or you can tour to Mount Inwang, featuring the Zen Rocks, right in the backdrop of the Gyeongbokgun Palace."
6186,4.0,"Seen on many travel posters, tourist brochures for a reason. The setting, the water, and the porportions of the main building is pretty close to perfect."
6187,5.0,"The palace was huge, 2 hours was not enough to walk around everywhere. Lots of excellent places to take pictures and take in the culture of a life that has all but passed.  The temple was nice, the park inside and the palace was great to see. It was hot and open, so bring water and snacks, but you can also buy inside.  There is a free area where you can try to wear traditional clothing, but the wait time is quite long.  The entrance fee is like 3000W each, which is great value and the train station is right beside, as well as ample number of taxi's.  Insadong is right infront of the palace, so great way to also do your shopping.  The palace was one of the highlights of our trip."
6188,5.0,"Visited this and CheongDuk Gung. We liked this one better--more spacious, more impressive. Terrific gift shop at the adjacent Folk Museum. Didn't stop to take a photo in traditional costume but it looked fun."
6189,4.0,"The grounds of this palace was just stunning and huge. Free guided tours are provided in several languages. A children's museum and an art museum are also here. I was expecting to be here for about an hour, but ended up spending 3-4 hours here."
6190,4.0,"Join the free guided tour. Guide was very good, speak very good English and share not only about the palace history but also on other Korean tradition and culture. Tried to catch the change of guard. The museum next to the palace cannot be missed. Entrance to museum is included in the palace ticket."
6191,3.0,"Managed to see the change of Guards which was some thing different from the British type. It was a good day, as it was raining the whole day. We went to this Palace by MRT line"
6192,4.0,"I liked the location, from the palace courtyard I could see the mountains surrounding the palace, and could almost imagine how it was during the olden days. Awesome. However, if you look the other way, you can see the tall office buildings now surrounding Seoul, so on that end, you can get a feel of the old and new in Korea.  Make sure to catch the changing of the guard (around 3pm). After visiting the palace, have some coffee at the museum cafe just before boarding the subway to your next destination."
6193,4.0,"There are many palaces in Seoul,and for most you can't visit all of them. So if you have to visit one of these beautiful palaces, I would say it has to be Gyeongbokgung.  It has its beauty and it is HUGE! You can wonder aroundt the palace enjoy sceneries. I recommend to visit the palace during the changing guard ceremony. Which I find it very entertaining and exciting to watch. This is on 11.00, 14.00 and 15.30. You can visit this place at any day but Monday!  TIPS: I went there two times already. In July, it's very HOT! so you may need to bring umbrella along."
6194,5.0,If you only have time to visit one palace in Seoul make sure it is this one. It is absolutely spectacular and you could easily spend a whole day there. The first day I went it poured with rain so went back a week or so later on a sunny day with blossom starting to appear. Just spectacular in a large city.
6195,5.0,The big palace in Capital city of Choseon dinasty were devided by the political reason in early 1900's. Gyeingokgung is the main core place of that big palace and there is the historical spot where Korean last Empress got assasinated by Japanese Yakuja during the termoil era...
6196,5.0,Enough to see and keep you and kids entertained for half a day.
6197,5.0,"This is one of the palace that you must not miss. Beautifully preserved with rich cultural site. On a sunny day, this place is excellent for taking pictures, very colorful, good view of the mountains. The palace a big place and need a few hours to really enjoy and relax walk to have glimpse of this location. Too bad we missed the changing of guards."
6198,4.0,"I think that one visiting Korea should not miss this place. It is in the heart of the city and very near other must see places like Gwanghamun park and the Blue Mansion. We got to see the changing of the Palace guards which is another good experience. The place covers a vast area and considerable time is needed to go around it. There was also free admission in the National Folk Museum which was also very educational. It might be very helpful though if they placed some historical description on each palace and not only on the entrances. Still, it is a must see for me."
6199,4.0,history + scenery = awesome. u'll regret if u dont visit this palace.. a very huge palace.. u can see guard ceremony every hours :)
6200,5.0,"While much of the site had to be recreated due to unavoidable outcome of war and occupation, the site is fabulous in detail and grandeur. Our English-language guide was very knowledgeable and provided much more history and information than a self-guided tour could have.  I give it five stars..... well done."
6201,4.0,A beautifully preserved traditional architecture in the center of modern Seoul. Its gardens and lakes are picturesque spots that will provide perfect shooting locations for photography enthusiasts. Take advantage of the free hanbok wearing at the souvenir shop!
6202,5.0,Very nice place. Apart from the Palace it is also a park with a great view of mountains.
6203,5.0,love the tour guide...she explained everything in detail..do check out the time for the free tour guide...we managed to get more than 10 people to save 600won for the entrance fee..it will be great if you can get more than 10 people and the ticket will be 2400 won ;)
6204,3.0,"The palace is under some construction in East areas at the moment. I recommend going in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid the masses of tourist buses and crowds point-and-clicking doing their 'been there done that' poses in enough time to get back to their bus tours. We arrived in mid-afternoon and spent the rest of the afternoon there until closing time at 6pm. The folk museum is North East of the palace and you need your ticket to re-enter the palace grounds after visiting the museum which is free. There's a lovely little coffee shop at the museum with small alfresco area to laze in the afternoon sun while sipping your coffee, or in my case, eating my softserve! No food is allowed in the palace grounds, so eat up before heading back in. The palace buildings were destroyed during the Japanese invasion and also the Korean war, so it lacks the historical 'feel', however beautifully reconstructed. Many families and couples take time to stroll through the park as it is quite a peaceful place when crowds have gone."
6205,5.0,"With or without the cherry blossoms, the palace site is one beautiful place you must visit when you are in Korea. Colorful palace guard clothes and flags compliment the intricate design of the roofs of their halls and gates. The vast space makes it good for strolling/roaming around while holding the hands of the one you love and occasionally sneak a kiss or two. :) There are many tourists here but with how huge the site is, you definitely can find a private place where you can sit down and have a heart-to-heart conversation amid the pavilions, lake, and the beautiful backdrop of the Bugak Mountain."
6206,4.0,"Two hours were barely enough to explore the lovely grounds, gardens and various palace courtyards and buildings. Allot more time if you wish to visit the folklore museum (also part of the complex) or linger to soak in the atmosphere. Northward views are majestic ---- looking at the palace buildings and the backdrop of mountains ---- and help transport you to a long-ago era. But look south and you suddenly see the office blocks of downtown Seoul, which bring you back to present-day reality."
6207,5.0,"If you only have time to visit one palace in Seoul, visit this one. It's big, elegant, and fun to walk around. You can also visit the national folk museum from there. Plan to spend about 2 hrs there... It's the nicest one in that area thrust me."
6208,5.0,I love walking around the grounds and go to the Folk Museum which is on the premises. The little pavilion on the small island is lovely.
6209,4.0,"I visited in February, it was very cold as it was mostly outside, but it also made the grounds even more beautiful. I felt sorry for the guards having to stand in the cold, but it looked like they had plenty of clothes on under their uniforms! The uniforms are very colourful and are certainly a 'highlight'. Try to catch the changing of the guard. Entry into the grounds is very cheap, especially for Seoul, and you can also visit the cultural museum, which was good for warming up on a cold day!"
6210,5.0,"Part of planning our itinerary for the day is looking up the different attractions clustered in one area, say Hongdae area. My friend and I decided to dedicate one day to do a 'cultural' tour. We planned on going to a couple of the palaces in Seoul, as well as a museum or two.  Gyeongbokgung Palace comes highly recommended in different Korean travel sites. It is the main palace in the Joseon dynasty. Anyway, we chose to get there before 1:30 PM so we can join the English guided tour of the palace.  The place was already packed with tourists and locals alike. There were different tour groups as well, but the place was big enough that it didn't feel crowded. We paid 3,000 Won each for admission into the palace.  The tour guide spoke English but with a very distinct Korean accent. Being exposed to the Korean English a lot more than my friend, I found it easier to 'understand' compared to my friend. The guide was very knowledgeable and inserted some anecdotes into her tour.  The tour lasted for one hour, but we weren't able to cover everything, so we were left to explore the rest of the compound.  There was also a Royal Changing of the Guards (I think) ceremony as we were leaving.  The reason why I suggest you start your Cultural tour here is that you won't need a tour guide for the other palaces since they are basically set up in a similar fashion.  Restorations are currently being done on some other part of the compound."
6211,4.0,"its big, you can see the imperial life in the palace and the history of it."
6212,3.0,This is a must see in Seoul! There are about 5 or 6 palaces... this is by far the best one! There is also a free tour in English everyday. I believe the tour is around 2p.m. Check their website to make sure though. Have a great time!
6213,5.0,There are so many things to see. You will appreciate the stillness of Seoul inside. Do not forget to visit.
6214,3.0,Easy to get to by subway. Need more scheduled tours.
6215,5.0,"I went there as part of city Morning Tour, just in time for 10:00am guard change, which, I'm told, happens 5 times a day even on a weekday. It started with a sound of a gong, then soldiers in colorful ancient costumes walked in patterns while playing various curious musical instruments. It’s a huge territory with a Museum with mountains on the backdrop. Beautiful! Lots of memorable pictures. By the way, the Morning Tour gives you a choice of leaving you (for free) at Itaewon – the international district. Take this opportunity! If you choose to get back to the hotel, it would be extra $10, and you’ll miss Itaewon."
6216,5.0,"Good guide, well organized tour around the immense palace space, learned something!"
6217,4.0,"Great place, definetly worth seeing when in the downtown Seoul area the admission is cheap and it is within walking distance of the subway. Beautiful grounds, most likely better suited for the history loving folks, who are able to imagine how these grounds must have looked and funtioned in the 15th century. Perhaps not so much for kids, teens or adults that require more visual stimulation for enjoyment.  The palace grounds could be enjoyed any time of the year, but probably best enjoyed during the mild weather months when a leisurely stroll through the lush grounds among beautiful flowers and tree blossums is possible."
6218,4.0,"If you have to pick to see one Palace ,this is it! nice and amazing art with history.. I love it."
6219,5.0,I had a Korean Goodwill Guide from the Toruism Board take me to Gyeongbokgung Palace and it was something I'll never forget! My guide Mr.Kim was a fountain of information throughout the palace tour... so much information it was hard to remember everything he told me but I tried! I took hundreds of photos at Gyeongbokgung Palace to remind me of this incredible experience. The palace is a huge complex of several buildings and features a changing of the guard ceremony and lot of people in colorful traditional palace costumes.  Very highly recommended... especially if you can go with a Goodwill Guide.
6220,4.0,"I've been visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace in late March, which is just a bit eary. Everything is still wintery brown and dry. However, I think it must be a beautiful place when the trees are in full bloom which should be in April I think. The layout reminds me of the Forbidden City in Beijing. I think it's well worth a visit. Try to catch one of the free guided tours and the ""changing of the guards""."
6221,4.0,I think this is the main palace out of all the palaces you can visit in Seoul. The architecture is impressive and well-preserved. We walked around the huge ground for an hour and a half and visited the different halls.
6222,5.0,"On our way to gyeongbokgong palace we meet group of volunteer students who offer free English tour within gyeongbokgong palace... This made our tour interesting... Special thanks to Alex Kwon, who spent almost the whole day getting us around gyeongbokgong palace and educating us about their rich culture:) Just outside the palace youll see gwanghwanmun square."
6223,4.0,"we needed many hours to see most of it, don't miss the guard's show."
6224,5.0,"The 1st royal changing ceremony start about 10.30am and the ceremony is about 10minutes only. Then you can take pictures with the guides..but dont be surprised that they will not smile at all. You still can take pictures with them and outside the palace even you dont but the ticket but to get inside, you have to buy ticket at only 3000won. They are more places to explore inside including korean national folk museum."
6225,5.0,"It's a scenario of the old times, beautiful place to spend some hours. Plan to be in front around 11AM that they have a ceremonial."
6226,5.0,"I have been there a few times already and it never gets boring! A great place to visit for a day, also for a picnic. Very well maintained . Don't miss the show at the entrance of the palace, it feels like going back in time! There is one part of the palace that you need to book at least a day before you visit, if you don't you cannot get in. Absolutely loved it!"
6227,4.0,"Enjoyed the trip to the Palace very much as we managed to catch the change of guards. It definitely is a sight to see.  The palace itself also has beautiful architecture and is a huge compound to walk around.  Tips: Check when the times for the change of guards are before you visit, and choose a palace you want to visit because visiting all of them may not be a very wise use of time in Seoul."
6228,4.0,"There are a number of well-reserved, ancient imperial palaces in Seoul, and visiting at least one of them is probably on the agenda of most visitors, and rightly so. They are held with a degree of reverence by the Korean people, and during our August visit here were many more Korean tourists than foreigners. Gyeongbokgung Palace is well-situated for most tourists, as it is close to the lovely Insadong neighbourhood with its restaurants, shops and art galleries, as well as being a five-minute walk from the interesting Bukchon Hanok Village with its Joseon-dynasty traditional houses.  Try to join one of the guided tour groups: they are informative but not overly talky. The palace is surprisingly large, and well-preserved. I found it amazing to see these huge palace structures dotting Seoul, throwbacks to the 14th and 15th centuries, surrounded primarily by modern buildings less than 30 years old. In Seoul it seems that there's very little that's ""old"": everything is either ""ancient"" or ""modern"", and Gyeongbokgung Palace is an excellent example of the former.  A 1-2 hour visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace would be a core component of a fruitful day in Seoul that included this historic site, some shopping and gallery-hunting in nearby Insadong, and a nice meal at one of the many restaurants in the immediate vicinity. The changing-of-the-guard ceremony doesn't have quite the pomp-and-circumstance of Buckingham Palace, but the colorful costumes are amazing and a photographer's delight! Overall Gyeongbokgung Palace didn't blow me away in the same manner as, for instance, Angkor Wat in Cambodia, but it is a worthwhile visit, and definitely part of what I would call ""the Korea experience""."
6229,3.0,Was a nice 3 hours looking around this relatively new copy of this 600 year old Palace.
6230,3.0,"The palace complex can be reach from 2 stations nearby - Gwanghwamun and Gyeongbokgung. It's good to start the visit from Gwanghwamun Gate as you can see the Imperial Guard at the entrance. There are souvenir shops in the complex area. During winter, you should go to the lake nearby Hwangwonjeong and get the experience to try their traditional top-spinning on the frozen lake."
6231,5.0,"If you are in Seoul, shell out and see a palace. This one is fine."
6232,3.0,"Nice Palace, but nothing grand about it.. Typical tourist stop. Worth taking a couple of pictures i guess :)"
6233,4.0,"Went here on a balmy, brisk Sunday afternoon in February. Temp was about 10C and the skies were clear and sunny with no wind. Beautiful day!  This was a great to decompress after a long, anxiety filled week.  I didn't know what to expect and a guide would have been nice but is certainly not necessary. It was relaxing to just stroll the ground, looking at all of the buildings and reading the plaques. The architecture is incredible and being there, you can imagine the 14th Century King holding court or strolling by the pond.  There are many benches and places to just sit and take it all in, which we did. We didn't have time to visit the Folk Museum or Palace Museum and will try to see them next time.  We saw the changing of the guards and snapped a few photos - in its own way, its as momentous and magnificent as Buckingham Palace.  Incredible to contrast this incredibly historic spot against what greets you right outside the gates."
6234,5.0,"I seem to find something new every time I visit Gyeongbokgung. The folk museum located inside the palace is great, the changing of the guard is really neat to watch. Just a beautiful area and lots of culture"
6235,5.0,"a day spent wandering around the palace and local museums with lots of free information in lots of languages and free guides who are helpful, if difficult to tell that you don’t want their help. Exploring on my own I find things that they may not show you, but they are there to ask when guiding others."
6236,3.0,"Went there by Metro , 5min walking and you will be at between 2 main road. You will see Emperor Sejong status. From there you can start your photopgrahy till you enter Geyongbukgung. By the time i arrived , there are some traditional dance show i assume. The building is well preserved but the paint to me is like a modern built one. Walk around and the lake in there are frozen. I like frozen lake. Great view and worth to be there if you visit Seoul!"
6237,2.0,"I would not make a special visit to this palace. Both the architecture and the palace ground is uninteresting. The National Folklore Museum is equally dry. (I personally found the exhibits very creepy. May because I am Chinese and a bit superstitious.} However if you are in the area you should not miss the interesting local designer shops, cafes and creative houses in the intricate lane ways east of Samcheongdonggil. If you were here around dinner time there are also numerous restaurants to choose from along this picturesque road."
6238,5.0,Traditional look at Korea as it was in the old days - very interesting and enjoyable
6239,4.0,"The guided tour was great. If you miss the schedule, they do have audio guide equipment for loan. It also offers free Korean clothing try-on service, so make sure your ask for the location before heading in."
6240,3.0,"If you have time to kill, then it's worth a visit. But if not, it's not imperative to make a stop here. This place has been rebuilt and is rather sparse and sad to say, lacking character or charisma. We did watch the changing of the guard, albeit a bit of a let down."
6241,5.0,great free english tour.... and colorful guard changing ceremony...close to culture museum and Blue House
6242,3.0,"I'm not going to kid you here folks - historical site tours are not for everyone. For anyone who has seen the Forbidden City, Angkor Wat or the Grand Palace in Bangkok, Gyeongbokgung Palace might not pack much of a tourist punch.  Having said that, if you enjoy Korean history or just the pleasure of exploring culturally significant sites, then Gyeongbokgung is a good choice for a day trip - especially if you visit near-by Insadong-gil (Insadong street) and explore the many wonderful side streets, alleyways, temples and galleries that the surrounding neighborhood has to offer.  I also encourage a quick visit to the very nearby Bukchon Hanok Village. It's a collection of traditional houses and streets that have been protected and restored, and I think it provides an excellent complement to a day of cultural/historical exploration!"
6243,4.0,Interesting to see the old palace and see how the royalty lived then. They had a much simpler life than I expected. Take the guideded tour. Tour is a definite must-do i you are visiting Seoul. Combine it with a trip to Inadong market - a few blocks away.
6244,4.0,The palace is huge. It requires couple of hours to walk through all major sites. It is sad to learn that all major palaces in Seoul were damaged or nearly destroyed in the past. But the remnants of the original palace and the newly reconstructed parts are definitely worth visiting. One can imagine the power those nations in Asia enjoy in their history. It is hard to imagine how large it was if the huge complex with many buildings represent 40% of its original size.
6245,3.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace has been under a restoration process for some years and so far a lot of the buildings have now been outwardly restored. The contents of some are still to be placed. The site is huge so good walking shoes a must, and it does get hot here so plenty of water.... Not many places to get food or drink on-site. The Palace certainly opens your eyes to how things used to be"
6246,4.0,Gyeongbokgung is huge!! I had a great time taking pictures and exploring all the entire place. Unfortunately I didn't have the time to attend the 'palace ceremony' (was rushing to somewhere else) :(
6247,4.0,"Highly tourist-ed but a great and easy see in the center of Seoul. Enjoy the walk around the Palace grounds (not a huge amount to see) then be sure to enjoy a bit the plethora of restaurants and drinking establishments (Hofs) around the area. When the smoke drives you coughing from one restaurant or bar (or every one), a walk along the canal is nice!"
6248,4.0,"Vast grounds and beautiful foliage, this place will give you a historical lesson of Seoul in the past"
6249,5.0,"The cultural experience of korea in the heart of Seoul. Easy to get to, v.big, but i wouldnt recommend visiting it in Winter. It gets too cold there and the absence of trees takes away from its beauty."
6250,3.0,"Nothing to cheer about but a historic palace... nothing to do beside walk around, look around and take photo... One thing gonna take note are, just exit from the Gyeongbokgung main exit, walk to your left end and there is a shop street. A shop selling a very tasty chicken and serving fresh draft beer~! It's a great dining experience in winter time~! Please look at the picture for reference~ strongly recommended~!"
6251,4.0,See what's it like back in those days... Went in Winter and there's ice everywhere..
6252,5.0,You can spend a good few hours here if you really looked at everything in detail and walk to every section of the palace.  There's a free guided tour (different languages at varying times) available but this is after you buy your entry ticket into the palace (3000 won).  You can't go into any of the buildings but there's some that you can look inside with a description in front.  The changing of the guard is definitely worth seeing as well and occurs every hour.  You really need to walk around the palace to appreciate why some people who worked in the palace in the olden days never even saw the king once the entire time!!
6253,4.0,Probably on of the best preserved ancient palaces. If you take the time to go through all the detail you will be amazed to see the brilliance of ancient times. Plan about two hours.
6254,4.0,"It's the biggest and most well known palace in Korea. How long you stay there is up to you. You could blow through it in an hour, with the pamphlet and a camera or you could stay there for hours with a guided tour. My biggest complaint about any palace in Korea is that they are INCREDIBLY well maintained, so they sometimes lose that feeling of history and age with every coat of fresh paint they slap on, but I have lived here 3 years and they are still pretty amazing sites. They are huge complexes in the center of one of the worlds largest cities and they really give you an idea of what life was like in Korea ages ago. Fall is the most beautiful time to go because it is not too hot and the fall colors actually make it even more gorgeous than in spring (aIs surprising as it sounds). It also gives you really beautiful views of the mountains, the Blue House where the President lives and it is quite large. It might be difficult for kids that are too small because you just look at things, you cant really interact or enter buildings, but kids above the age of 7 I'm sure would find a way to enjoy it. It's perfect if you are taking family visiting Korea, if you are a family visiting Korea, teens, friends or couples."
6255,5.0,The Korean government is currently reconstructing the buildings of this palace. Before the Japanese ocupation the palace had 800 buildings; during the occupation all but 10 buildings were torn down. The project to restore Gyeongbokgung is a fifty year project; half the project has already been completed. The reconstruction has been made difficult by urban expansion. The work done so far is very impressive and I look forward to seeing Gyeongbokgung in all its glory in the future.
6256,5.0,"Though buildings are extensively reconstructed, it is enjoyable to wander around and immerse oneself in the historic architecture of a bygone Korea."
6257,5.0,"Worth a visit - it was extremely cold when we did, but the grounds are gorgeous. I'd be interested in seeing the grounds in warmer weather. There was snow on the ground for us. The buildings are lovely and you can pose with the colorfully dressed soldiers at the entrance."
6258,5.0,"we were only in Seoul for 27 hours, but we managed to visit this palace. It was definitely worth the visit, it is very easy to get to, picturesque, and the changing of the guards is very cool!"
6259,3.0,"pretty much a watered down version of forbidden city of beijing. has some korean influence on some of the elements though. can visit if have time, admission is cheap and not a factor."
6260,5.0,A nicely preserved old palace. The changing of the guards is an interesting spectacle. The Korean Folklore museum inside the complex shows a lot of Korean history. The only thing I didn't like was the wheather: it was minus 15°C... brrr
6261,3.0,"Had good shows of guard exchanges, royal family tour. A smaller version of palaces with chinese roots of zodiac stone statues and rooftops."
6262,5.0,"This became one of the highlights of our tour, not only because of the Palace and grounds, but also we got to try on a traditional Korean costume!  First, the Palace and grounds ... the area was bigger than I expected and had a bit of a tiring walk to explore, but I didn't mind because this meant it didn't seem to be as crowded. The Palace and other buildings were majestic and I liked the feeling of history it brought for me. We arrived there at around 3PM, which was perfect timing because we witnessed the ""guard"" show. Not sure if it was meant to be a changing of the guards, or a reenactment of a historical event (I wasn't paying attention when they announced it) but I did enjoy the show.  Then there's the traditional Korean costume. As we explored, we noticed a sign beside the coffee shop showing some traditional costumes. Turns out that they allow you to try on a traditional Korean costume! And it's for free! But when we got there, they already had quite a long waiting list and couldn't accommodate us anymore. So my friends and I went back early the next morning, just so we could experience this. The costume place opens at 10AM, and they allow you to have it on for about 15 minutes, in which time you can explore around in costume in nearby areas to give you the perfect photo opp. :-)"
6263,5.0,"Bring a camera. You'll find lots of beautiful pictures. It is large, so be prepared for a lot of walking. You can buy a little box that describes what you are seeing in several languages. Enjoy!"
6264,3.0,"The palace is pretty new. I assume that the original was destroyed. Lay-out and look similar to Forbidden Palace but on a smaller scale. There are guards and shows by them, and the kids will enjoy them."
6265,5.0,"My hubby and I went here on our first date, and had lovely time. Check out the folk museum next door (and let me know if you find the boys water jugs!). One thing I love about Korean public attractions is that they are reasonably priced, so you can return again and again. Obviously, as my first date, it has a special place in my heart, but it still has plenty to check out. It's also very convenient and close to many other attractions or places to go (Statue of Lee, biggest foreign language bookstore, Tomatillos). Over all, the palaces are very similar, except one has ""Biwon"" which is the secret garden (not Gyeongbokgung, though) If you have been to the Forbidden Palace in Beijing, you may be disappointed. It is very similar, but smaller, but has it's own beauty, nevertheless. By comparison, the process of getting in here is much easier. Since my husband and I are leaving after many years in Korea, we recently went back to take photos again. Second time around, it was beautiful and awe inspiring. It has sections designed to draw kids as well... I recommend it!"
6266,4.0,Its really nice. It reminded me of the Korean soap operas. When you're inside you will imagine how life was like in the old times. The place is very clean and well kept.
6267,4.0,"Visit one and you got the idea of how it look like all. Pretty bland and less ornaments compare to palaces in Japan. But its Korean humbleness who win peoples heart. Humble, pure and tradition above all."
6268,4.0,Make this one of your places to see while visiting Seoul. Very beautiful & intricate remaking of some of these structures. Do some research on the history of this palace or else you'll find yourself just looking at pretty buildings.better yet get a tour guide. you wil be doing a lot of walking so prepare yourself. Visit the National Museum of Korea which is on the grounds. It is located way in the back and is free admission
6269,5.0,"The palace is clean and there is a wonderful performance on changing of guards at certain time of the day. However, there are a lot of tourists in the palace and it is therefore very crowded."
6270,4.0,Changing of guards ceremony and the historical palaces
6271,4.0,The Royal family lived in such simplicity and it is a good picture on why Koreans can be so hard on themselves to excel sometimes.
6272,4.0,Very nice palace. Unfortunately the interior is shown only on small maps and not with open windows to let you look inside. Palace guards are very helpful with foreigners
6273,5.0,Tour guides in every language. Bring walking shoes though. Bring a good camera. The changing of the guards is worth seeing all by itself.
6274,4.0,I have forced my korean partner to explain me how to get to this place from one of the suburbs. Took a city bus and got there by 25 min. Easy to find and follow. Difficult to believe that all complex was rebuilt during last five years or something. Gorgeous view on the mountain from one side and on the modern city on other. Unfortunately had not time to visit museum. It seems that Palace wants me to come again. Many people are walking around and a lot of schoolchildren run around.
6275,4.0,"Between Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung, i prefer Gyeongbokgung, as there is more to see and the secenary was much better.  There is also the guard changing ceremony that happens every hours in front of the palace and if u want have some good food. At Gyeongbokgung station exit 2 there is Tosokchon (토속촌) the famous Samgyetang shop which even the president of korea patronises.  So all in all a good all round place to visit."
6276,3.0,was having a high hope when coming over to checkout the palace. When we arrive it is a bit of disappointing as it look bit barren / empty.  if you're visiting here on summer i suggest to visit here in the evening as the sun is too hot to move around.  there is a museum nearby which the access is free of charge :)
6277,4.0,Take the free tour. Really worth the 1 hour time. You will be given time to take photos.
6278,3.0,"Very fortunate to catch the changing of the guard at 9.30am, loved the costumes and music, especially the drums, but buildings empty of furniture or artefacts. Best thing was proximity to Folk museum which was great."
6279,4.0,"We missed the free English tour which started at 9am (outdated guide book said 9.30am..) and so my husband and I rented 2 gps self-guided tour handsets which was cool. We chose the one-hour course and the sets pointed the way to visit the palace in a meaningful way. Each time you strolled to a location of interest, the handset automatically starts and tells you more. The only downside was that the handset was a tad hard to use (we were told that ""to hear more about XXX, press more"" and we could not find the ""more"" button). Would recommend you devote at least 2 hours, and give this priority in your itinerary."
6280,5.0,"It was one of the must-see sights, so we did and enjoyed it very much... just walking around the grounds."
6281,4.0,"take a good picture in one of their parks, we the ground is covered with yellow leaves. I love their Autumn, we have none."
6282,5.0,We spent a couple of hours wandering around the palace and could have spent more time. A highlight was a young woman being photographed in her hanbok (with flip-flops on underneath!). The wood carvings and painted ceilings were amazing...as were the tiles (and animals) on the roofs.
6283,5.0,"For anyone who loves palaces, this is one palace you shouldn't miss. It's magnificent ! Since it was autumn, the beautiful falling leaves and colorful trees made the palace all the more beautiful. You have to walk quite a bit to see the whole area but it's so worth it!"
6284,4.0,"I am quite surprise when I reached this palace. I don't have much expectation as I thought this is just a palace with buildings and garden. What surprise me is the surrounding scenery. What a beautiful place! I went there during autumn, and the leaves are so beautiful, especially the scenery near the lake. The ticket is quite cheap. Worth visiting!"
6285,4.0,"This palace was so overcrowded that I had a hard time finding a good photo op, but the Changing of the Guard was really cool and worth the trip. The Banquet Hall was very nice as well. Personally, I preferred some of the other palaces, probably because they were less crowded and there was more time to stroll and enjoy the grounds."
6286,4.0,"Gyeongbukgung is the crown jewel of Seoul's collection of royal palaces, with complete access at no more than a few US dollars. You could honestly spend all day wandering its huge expanse, there's just so much history there and so many different styles of architecture to appreciate as well. Besides the main pavilions, I recommend seeing the Hyangwonjeong Pavilion towards the north gate and the Gyeonghoeru (Royal Banquet Hall), set on water. But honestly, its worth it to just take your time and wander through the whole thing leisurely and read the posted information along the way. I loved Gyeongbukgung so much I went twice during my trip! On a side note, do not miss either the National Palace Museum (separate 1,000W admission) or National Folk Museum attached to Gyeongbukgung."
6287,2.0,good museums within. but you can tell it is just too touristy. not ORIGINAL
6288,3.0,Try to go to the palace when they have the traditional guards march. Good picture opportunity.
6289,4.0,"I walked through the palace areas, but except for a private house at the entrance and the throne room, most of the ""appartments"" where empty/unfurnished. The palace was renovated in the 1990s and one can often feel that it is not really that old. I watched the change of the guard and the costumes were very well done. Overall a pleasant visit. It can be seen as an afternoon away from the stress."
6290,3.0,I went in throught the back entrace and walked all the way up to the main gate. Saw the changing of the guard
6291,4.0,"The first thing that crosses one's mind when Gyeongbokgung is mentioned is history. That first impression will be reinforced when you set foot in Gyeongbokgung. Not only is there history, there is also culture, colors, architecture and so on.  This place is so fascinating that I spent about 4 hours exploring every corner of the palace ground! When my poor feet complained, I sat myself at one of the many benches under shady trees and did some people watching.  It is amazing how they reconstructed and preserved this place in a very original state. It's definitely worth more than KRW 3,000 (the price of the ticket)!!  The must do's at Gyeongbokgung are: 1. Watch the changing of guards that happens at every hour from 10am to 3pm. When you hear the drums beating, be sure to be at the main entrance area. 2. Snap a photo with the guards at the main door which is facing Gwanghwamun. 3. Take a look at all the (kings, queens and princes') quarters that are opened for public viewing. Only 1 or 2 allows you to actually go into the quarters. But be careful of shoe theft. 4. Stroll along Hyangwonjeong Pavilion. The view around the hexagonal pavilion is just magnificent. 5. Take a walk to behind the palace, where you can get a glimpse of the Blue House (presidential palace). That's also the road to the National Folk Museum, a recommended drop-by where you can see the evolution of Korea.  The only don't is not to visit on a Tuesday as it is closed.  The Palace is quite wheelchair and stroller friendly. At places where there are stairs (except those where you have to climb up high e.g. to the main hall/quarters) there are paths for wheels.  There is a cafe near the Sujeongjeon hall, west of the main courtyard. Inside the cafe, you can also find a souvenir shop."
6292,4.0,"Very cheap admission (KRW2,000) for what you get. There was some sort of changing of the guard type thing around 11am. Unsure if it's hourly or at a certain time of the day. Over crowded with tour groups in the front main buildings. There's plenty of ground to cover in the back and fewer people."
6293,4.0,"We went to Gyeongbokgong palace only to watch the Opening of Royal Guard Changing Ceremony at 10 am in the morning at the main entrance. This is a great opportunity to experience the rare traditional scene just in front of us. We were so excited and took photos with the traditional costume of the Guards after the ceremony. While waiting for the ceremony to be started, we took the opportunity to visit National Palace Museum located on the left of Gyeongbokgong main entrance which is free admission."
6294,4.0,Nice to walk around and to discover the many hidden corners.
6295,4.0,"I have one day to visit the sites of Seoul while on a recent business trip. This was a must see and the changing of the guards ceremony made it especially nice. It helped that I had an excellent tour guide, but all in all the beauty of the grounds spoke for themselves. The museum on the grounds was a bit hokey. Then again, I'm not a big museum person so probably not fair to criticize! I recommend this on the list of things to see -- if you go here, I would skip other temple sites. This was clearly the best."
6296,4.0,"Be prepared for a good walk as the palace compound is huge. The former kings must have chosen the place due to its good fengshui as it overlooks a mountain. If you want to know more about Korean history, head onto the museum inside the place which is covered by the entrance fee. There is basically information on how Koreans evolved over the years (i.e costumes, food, handwriting, traditions, etc). Also a good place to enjoy the air-condition after the long walk under the hot sun.  Love the trees and intricate architecture.  Be there before 10 am if you want to witness the changing of guards. The palace is closed every Tuesdays to allow it to be used for filming (presumably Korean period dramas).  As you head out of the palace, cross the road and walk straight for about 50-80 metres and you can find the Museum of King Sejong. TYou won't missed it because there is a huge statue of the King in front of the museum. Though small-scale, it's loaded with information and best of all, it's free. Do watch the short 4-D show to learn how the Koreans fought and won against their enemy with only 1/3 of the battleships. It's so surreal.  On your left after you cross the road as you exit the museum, you will find one of the biggest Starbucks in Seoul which is 4-storey high. A nice way to chill and end your trip to the palace."
6297,5.0,"Big place, definitely a must do. You could spend half to a full day self exploring."
6298,5.0,"I absolutely love this palace. It is breathtakingly gorgeous and ripe for photo opportunities. Free English tours are offered at 11:00, 1:30 and 3:30, which I highly recommend. Be ready for some fascinating information about the palace construction and Korean history."
6299,3.0,This is 1 of the Five Grand Palaces and its the biggest located in the north of Seoul. Its a great visit for history buffs or those that love structures and want to see how the Joseon Dynasty lived. It is a huge space so expect to spend more than 4 hours if you want to fully enjoy and absorb the palace. The changing of guards is a nice bonus however some might find it a spectacle meant for tourist. One of my favourite structures is the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion surrounded by a man made lake. There is also the National Folk Museum of Korea which shouldn't be missed as you get a glimpse of how the Koreans lived through time. There are tonnes of photo ops for photography buffs however with the amount of visitors roaming around it can get annoying or tough to get good shots. Nothing a little patience can't fix.  Overall I would say its worth a visit if you are at Seoul. Easily accessible via the subway. Plus how can you go to Seoul and not visit a palace!
6300,2.0,"I'd like to start off by saying that I'm a history buff - especially the dynasties of East Asian countries. Having read so much good reviews, I made this palace my top priority during my visit. To say that I was disappointed would have been an understatement. It was like a palace on a budget. Don't go expecting the splendor of a bygone era. The sprawling grounds are filled with identical buildings with little to differentiate from one to another. Even my poor hard-working tour guide was hard put to infuse much enthusiasm into the group which had gone there with so much anticipation."
6301,4.0,"I went to Gyeongbokgung Palace the day after my arrival as I was informed that the palace was a must see in Seoul. It was certainly that. The entrance is a large open area with the palace in front of a serene mountain backdrop. Although not the original construction (rebuilt in late 19th and early 20th century), the buildings attempt to recreate the original design and appear to have achieved that very well. As you walk into the palace grounds you start to see just how massive the location is and the many different buildings it has to offer. I enjoyed the Geunjeongjeon (throne hall) and Gyeonghoeru (pavilion on the water) the most. The Geunjeongjeon holds the most interesting interior and the Gyeonghoeru offers the best spot for pictures. The many other buildings are interesting to look at and you can enter some of them for additional close ups of what the palace may have looked like. I spent a few hours here and that was just about right, which included viewing the changing of the guards which was pretty interesting as they are in traditional dress. The Korean folk museum is worth the charge of admission (free) for a quick walk through, but only advise visiting if you are staying in Seoul for an extended period. The drawback to the palace is the lack of interior in many of the buildings to give a sense of each buildings purpose and also of the daily life of the palace inhabitants."
6302,5.0,"The palace grounds are only a short distance from the subway station which is next to what is now the National Palace Museum. Gyeongbokgung Palace is in an area of central Seoul known as the Palace District. The grounds of Gyeongbokgung Palace are extensive, yet on first entering them from the nearby subway station you may find yourself (as we did) watching the Changing of the Guard Ceremony - an interesting spectacle if only for the colourful costumes!  After purchasing a ticket for the palace grounds (either W3,000 or W10,000 if you buy a combination ticket which includes other attractions) you enter through the impressive gateway into beautifully kept grounds with a number of elegantly restored and graceful palace buildings set against a backdrop of the mountains of Bukhansan National Park to the north.  As you walk around the extensive grounds, you can admire the architecture and ornate decoration of the different buildings (Gyeonghoe-ru Pavillion and Hyangwon-jeong are set in their own man-made lakes) and marvel at such a peaceful setting in the midst of a bustling city.  You are not able to enter the buildings (there are very few objects inside anyway), but you can see enough of the interior to appreciate the elaborate decoration and beautiful architecture.  Note that the palace is closed every Tuesday.  You can easily spend most of the day here, especially if you visit the National Folk Museum ( and gift shop) in the same grounds (entrance is free), which is interesting to anyone who wants to find out more about Korean history and culture."
6303,4.0,"When in Seoul as a tourist this is the #1 attraction. When on business and having 1-2 hours spare time during the day or weekend, visit this place. Although reconstructed after much destruction by the Japanese colonists and relatively simple for a palace, the overall experience is great and the grounds make for a nice walk. Entry WRN 3,000. Be prepared for herds of tourists though during weekends & holidays, so probably during the week is a better experience. When I was there in August it was quite warm but above all very humid, so prepare for some serious sweating while walking the grounds. The National Folk museum in the back on the right is OK, if you have another hour and to cool off, but more interesting for locals than for foreigners. Entry for the museum is free. Showing your palace ticket will let you enter the palace grounds again."
6304,3.0,"Of cause you have to see the royal palace if you are Ib Seoul. But dont put your expectations to high. The palace is surprisingly modest, but of cause its interesting to see how the king lived. Please dont see the change of guards. It seems to be only made for tourists and children and its simply a joke to watch. The guards are clumsy and lazy. In stead try to get access to Gyonghoeru-house in the palace-area. Not lots of tourists have the chance to go there and its interesting"
6305,4.0,"With changing of the guards, wide expansive grounds and its very location in the centre of the city, Gyeongbokgung Palace gives visitors an insightful glimpse of the rich traditions of the Josun dynasty. Although Changdeokgung Palace is a UNESCO heritage site, the limited access to protect the site ironically makes it less of an experience."
6306,5.0,"I had to do a rush through due to time constraints, but I wish I had a whole afternoon to spend here. This place is HUGE!! When you enter the grounds, you think....this is it. But it just keeps going. Wear comfortable shoes! If you watch historical Korean dramas, you'll really appreciate this place. You'll get a understanding of the whole royal family, servant quarters. Great photo opportunities. Although the kids had no appreciations for it, they loved all the running around they could do."
6307,5.0,"Make sure you bring your walking shoes, the facility is huge! We saw a lot of people with bad shoes on. This is an amazing opportunity to see history. What a treat! The museum is also quite good. It is well worth the money and your time. Great for kids and adults. It may be difficult to bring someone in a wheelchair."
6308,4.0,"The low cost of the palace makes it worth it to just walk in and take a look around. I believe a majority of it is all reconstructed, so you aren't looking at centuries old buildings. You can still be impressed with the grounds and the effort to protect the culture and history."
6309,5.0,"It's 3000 Won to enter, which isn't bad. This palace is really intact and you can tell that they keep it preserved very well. The architecture is amazing! You can't fully go inside, but you can take a peek inside, to see how the other half lived back in the day."
6310,5.0,Entering the Palace grounds is deceptive - it is really a large complex and you could spend a good deal of time exploring the buildings (re-creations). There are ceremonies near the entrance with folks in period costumes. The architectural details are beautiful. There is a good museum across the street. We did the palace grounds - then had lunch (bibimbop) nearby and then went to the museum. You can also walk to the Blue House from here - that's the Korean White House where their President lives.
6311,4.0,"Having seen so many palaces and temples in Asia, we inititally thought this would be an hour long, in and out, type of attraction. To my amazement, between the palace, the changing of the guard and the two museums on the grounds of the palace, we spent the better part of the day here.  The Palace grounds themselves, house many different buildings in more than once style, so it is worth it to wander and see all the areas and the gardens that connect them. Everything is well kept and protected. Some buildings have rooms furnished and set up to give one a glimpse of how daily life was conducted in this palace. Although the changing of the gaurd is an obvious tourist catch with university age guards with glued on beards, it is still a fun and colourful display. There are two free museums on the grounds that are most definitely worth a visit as well. The Royal museum contains a restaurant, that while not cheap, offers high quality food that is very tasty."
6312,4.0,"We did a three-hour morning tour which included this palace complex. We watched the colourful changing of the guard procession at 10.00am.  The complex contains beautiful ornate buildings set against the majestic mountain backdrop and with a serene man-made lake in the middle.  Unfortunately there wasn’t much to see inside the palace buildings as everything has been removed.  Nevertheless, something not to miss on your Seoul holiday.  Also in the complex is the National Folk Museum of Korea which we were only permitted to pay a fleeting visit to due to time constraints. It looks full of interesting exhibits and will definitely merit a longer visit when we next visit Seoul."
6313,4.0,"I think the many many other reviews have said it all. Just want to share some info that visitors may need. There are free (?) guided tours in various languages. And on weekends, there are free guided tours by volunteer organizations, which is what we took. Our guide was a 13 year old high school student. While we were there, we could try on Korean traditional costumes for free and for a very good laugh. ;) The palace is closed every Tuesday.  While Gyeongbok Palace is definitely worth a visit, we heard that Changdeokgung Palace and its gardens were even better. Unfortunately, did not get to see Changdeokgung as we went on a Monday when it was closed ;( so do plan your trips!"
6314,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung palace, the obvious seat of government in older times, is a showpiece for the city, staring down at the city's main avenue through the reconstructed Gwanghwamun gate, giving it the proper sightlines so important in eastern palace layouts. Seen from the outside from the newly built pedestrian center area of that avenue, the gate and palace grounds are nicely framed by a backdrop of green mountains. Being the main palace in Seoul, it features a number of displays, including performers in traditional dress showing various aspect of court pageantry. Also worth visiting is the folk museum within. The buildings are predictable large and ornate, and more geometrically laid out than at other palaces. The detailing and shape of the roofs are unique, and the large number of carved stone figures, some of them unfortunately encased in transparent boxes due to unruly visitors, interesting indeed. As usual in such palaces, the women's sleeping quarters have a more livable look to them. Maintenance and upkeep are very good, reflective of the country's current prosperity."
6315,4.0,"Worth a visit if you have some extra time. There are many palces in Seoul, so pick one and go. This one is one of the biggest ones, another one to consider is the Changdeokgung Palace, also a big one and that one is a cultural heritage site. The Gyongbokgun Palace took us at least an hour to get around and we could have spent longer. Lots of walking here, be prepared and not in a rush.  This palace I believe closes at 6pm, and the last entry is at 5pm, so get there before then or take pictures from the outside only. It is worth going inside to see more.  The subway exit will be obvious once you get to the right one because the walkway sort of looks like a palace would look only a little more modern. Sorry do not remember which exit number, but all the travel maps will probably be able to tell you which one.  There are gift shops inside this one and the other ones.  Anyway worth a visit, lots of walking, need good walking shoes, refreshed camera battery, etc..."
6316,4.0,"A rather colourful palace, certainly more so compared to the Forbidden City in Beijing. Quite enjoyed the pagaentry in front of the palace."
6317,5.0,"I visited Gyeongbokgung Palace on February 14, 2010, the second day of Seollal – the Lunar New Year celebration, and managed to get inside without paying a ticket. Not sure now if it worked for other visitors but on that day, I was wearing two items belonging to the 'hanbok' suit, a silk shirt and a soft cotton jacket, which I bought in Insadong area, earlier the same day. (Of course, during the wintertime, you will not wear just those two, but some more layers above to make you warm.) Although the Gyeongbokgung palace itself was an interesting experience for me (it was my first visit to a Korean historical site), I particularly liked an internal museum that is located within the site – the National Folk Museum of Korea. The museum provides an insight to the old textile manufacture, the works in the field like harvest & many food descriptions (including their beloved kimchi specialty) and many more things. I specifically enjoyed studying exceptional male and female dresses, including those intended for wearing by royalties or in weddings.  Within the same area of Gyeongbokgung Palace there were several outdoor exhibitions and workshops related to the old skills, like kite making or so. It looked to me that those workshops were established intentionally during the Seollal days because Koreans are likely to practice playing traditional games and folk custom, including wearing their colorful 'hanbok' suits.  Near the area of Gyeongbokgung Palace is a large rectangular square that was populated with hundreds of people, playing with kites flying etc. Although it was freezing cold those days in Seoul, I suppose that the lunar year celebrations are probably the best time to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace (as well as the other similar areas of the Korean capital). It is obvious that most of the locals, who do not plan to travel to the countryside for visiting their families and relatives, spend those days to visit the palaces too. That means it is a good opportunity to mingle with Korean people and learn about that part of their lifestyle."
6318,5.0,"My 1 of Korean friends told me that the palaces are all build with science and all paintings have great meaning. Even a stone locates with science and even a line in painting means the life. I visited again the palaces and then I touched deeply. Most things what I saw, where I visited are always have meaning of life. Nowadays Korea have been modern like Western but still they have many important traditional things. So I recommend you to visit the place if you want real Korea thing."

I lived in Seoul and visited several of them, and, although I believe this is the only one that costs money, it is also the best one. I would highly recommend a visit to anyone who is in town. When I was there, admission cost only 1000 won, so it was a great value."
6323,2.0,"this palace probably presents the image of Korean history, culture, palaces stuff, but think again to bring teenagers to this place. this was the first place I visited during my visit to Seoul and all I could say is 'errrr.. can we go somewhere else?' this place is fantastic for enthusiastic people who's interested in Korean history, etc. but for teenagers, this place is better avoided. we won't like it."
