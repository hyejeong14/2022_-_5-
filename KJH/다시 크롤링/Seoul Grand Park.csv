224,5.0, Its cheap theres a lot to see and its a mustgo place for those with children 
225,5.0,"The sky lift over the lake at this season - no flowers, no snow - alone was worth the visit. The lake was frozen at the edges. The calmness and reflections were peaceful. We bought a package ticket. However, it only included one ride (between the zoo and the zoo entrance or between the zoo entrance and the main entrance). Would recommend to save th the ticket for the latter ride.  The zoo was bigger than imagined. There was a good variety of animals, and more than 6 tigers. The living conditions of some animals were not as satisfactory."
226,5.0,The Seoul Grand Park has a good zoo and rose garden. I did not see roses in past visits but this time (late Oct.) the rose garden was filled with roses. In autumn the autumn colours are fascinating. However this year was dry and the summer was unusually long so the ginkgo and maple trees were much less attractive than last year. I like the park because it has a bird house where one could see various birds face to face ie not caged. The zoo is very large and has a wide range of animals.
227,4.0,"The zoo is big and nice, better you buy the package ticket wich incl elephant tram and sky lift. The only minus thing is there is not much option for food. Mostly sell sausage, teokkebi, and other korean food. So, if you want to eat other cuisine, bring it from home/ buy it before get in to the zoo. Oh, there is also 1 kfc outlet wich always full and dunkin doughnut before the ticket counter."
228,5.0,"We went there to visit the Zoo, we ended up visiting the whole place and spend the whole day there. The zoo is big and there is a lot to see. There is a sky lift that goes over a huge distance with amazing views. We did not expect something so nice - we were also lucky to go there in autumn when all the leaves were changing and the views were incredible. Definitely go even just for the sky lift ride - it was amazing!"
229,5.0,"To access this area I would recommend using the lift as it provides an aerial view of the zoo. Within the zoo there are many animals on display from giraffes, elephant, lion, etc. The zoo is well- kept and the grounds are so pleasant to walk through. There are even some activity areas such as a rock wall and elephant trunk slide."
230,5.0,"We drove. Traffic was pretty backed up getting to and from the parking lot and Waze was directing us away from the parking we needed, beyond the ""Seoul Zoo"" parking sign, so we ignored Waze. We were able to pay for parking using our debit card, didn't need a Korean bank card or won. 5,000 won for a smaller vehicle and 10,000 won for a larger. From the parking lot, follow the crowds to get tickets for the Elephant Tram or walk 1km to the main entrance of the zoo. At the zoo entrance, buy tickets to enter the zoo. There are stroller rentals available, we were also able to use our debit card for this. 3,000 won, but had to leave ID there until we returned. Strollers were nice. The zoo grounds are beautiful. It was hot out, but I bet a trip in the fall would have been perfect. I was expecting to see a lot of sad exhibits based on other comments, but they seemed pretty typical compared to any other zoo I've been to. I thought the spacing was good and yes, there's a lot of walking, but it didn't feel like too much. My kids had a lot of fun. I thought the food/drink choices were good, too. You can also bring your own food and drink in if you wanted. When leaving, you have to buy a return trip for the Elephant Tram or make the 1 km trek back to the parking area (which is also the same as the entrance to the subway)... I recommend going, especially if you have kids! It was fun!"
231,4.0,"Easter weekend travel to Seoul Korea and we knew we would have to visit the Seoul Zoo during April, my daughter loves animals and zoo's, we came here in Dec 2018 and it was too cold and the animals were all housed inside so it wasnt fun last time but this time it was amazing.  The weather was very nice, sunny and cool, no icy floor, the cherry blossoms were still in effect so lots of people were still taking pictures, all the animals were out and about instead of locked in large rooms.  Kids get in free so when we went there was many school children which was very nice to see them enjoy the park."
232,5.0,"The park has been one of my favorites in Seoul. It had been under renovation for many months but fortunately the renovation was completed when I went there in early Nov., 2018. The aviary was extensively altered. Now the visitors are isolated from the birds by glass panels. However some new species have been added. I like to go there in late Oct. or early Nov. as the maples and ginkgo trees create a beautiful mix of red, orange and yellow colors. The park is very large and I like the zoo most. To save walking, it is better to take the chair lift to the top and then walk down the hill. Once back to the zoo entrance I usually take the chair lift back to the main entrance, around sunset time. The view (from the chair lift) of the lake at sunset is fascinating."
233,2.0,"I love visiting zoo’s and seeing different animals. However, I recommend not visiting this zoo. I travelled 1.5 hours to get here, and I feel like my time travelling and visiting was wasted. There were many different animals, which was probably the best point. Each enclosure was small, dirty, and there was no sign of a zookeeper anywhere. Usually on my visits to the zoo I see many zookeepers tending and feeding the animals, but during my visit here I didn’t see any. Many animals looked sad and hungry, often eating dry leaves. The monkeys were also acting out at each other, probably because the cages were so small. As I mentioned, I love to visit the zoo, just not this one."
234,5.0,"About an hour bus ride from Seoul is the Seoul Grand Park with Zoo. It is a fun place for friends and families. The place is huge and so many animals to see. You will see bears, elephants, birds and a lot more. The entrance fee is not that expensive which comes with a free ride to the zoo bus and skylift. It goes uphill so you will get tired going up so be sure to bring some water and snacks to replenish."
235,4.0,"It is a place where you can touch, see, and enjoy animals. Especially, in spring and fall season, you can see flower, rose,chrysanthemum and use the elephant train to get to the entrance quickly and the family can go on a picnic."
236,5.0,Almost everyone goes to Seorak Mountain on autumn season and we head from a Korean friend to visit the Seoul Grand Park for autumn and it was really beautiful. Worth to visit on autumn!
237,4.0,"This is a park in massive area which includes multiple different attractions. The zoo has most visitors and is a pretty good place to any ages.  Facilities: Zoo, Garden, Camping Zone, Seoul Land(Amusement Park), Contemporary Museum, etc. We only entered the zoo. But, there was a rose garden as a season special and it looked nice, too.  Location: This is in Gwacheon City. But, only 4 stops away from Metro Sadang Station (line #4). Accessibility is great from Seoul. From the metro station, it's a short walk to the park. There are some food stalls in the way. It's fun to watch and I recommend having foods here because foods inside the park are much more expensive.  Zoo: - We bought combined ticket of 10,500 won for a lift, a elephant bus and an entrance. After buying the ticket, go to the lift station on the right and take the lift until the highest area of the zoo. Walk around the zoo and take the bus when it's done. This seems to be the best way to save money.  - The zoo was fine. Food stands, bathrooms, benches are everywhere. Bird Zone is like a Jurassic Park. If you are lucky, you'll be able to see parrots very closely. We were very amused to see apes. I think Ape Zone is the best part in this zoo.  - I was a bit disappointed not to see lions. There were MANY constructions and some animals aren't staying at where they are supposed to be. Bat cages were empty.  - It's a lot of walking anyway. Be ready to get tired.  - There's A-Zoo tour on the website to travel comfortably riding on a cart for children or seniors. It's not available at the ticket office. I think they should fix that.  - Even though there are animals of many kinds, there are still many this zoo doesn't have. So, don't expect to see every one you can imagine.  - There's an arboretum in the zoo. It was just okay level.  - There are a number of visitors in the zoo. But, this is a huge zoo and there's no chance to wait to see something. We liked it.  - Some of them close at 18:00. You'd better enter before that if you wish to see everything."
238,4.0,"Most of our visit was in the Zoo Park, many animals of all types, we did not see what some may think as abuse, Great walking self guided tour, getting up the hill you ride a Ski Chairlift, safety netting below. we were 4 adults and all of us enjoyed the 3 hrs or so we were there, quick lunch spots throughout. A tip we did not have our Passports with us a discount would have been applied, not sure of amount. Not far from Downtown Seoul, we would visit again in 2 years when we go back"
239,3.0,The park was one of my favourites but unfortunately it was under renovation during my last two visits (April 2017 and April 2018). Not a great deal to see during renovation as many of the major attractions were closed. Hope to see it again next year.
240,1.0,"I came here on an a Korean language class trip and was appalled by the living conditions of the animals. The enclosures were too small and the animals looked absolutely miserable. Some of them were acting out obviously because they were going crazy in their enclosures. I couldn't believe the beautiful animals they had that were being kept prison. They care more about having different types of animals (there must have been at least 15 different types of monkeys) than the welfare of the animals. One monkey was kept in a large, empty concrete box with just a swing to keep it entertained and it broke my heart to see the monkey sitting in the corner, baring its teeth fiercely at us. Do not visit this animal prison, you are only contributing to the problem!"
241,4.0,"Seoul Grand Park is actually quite close to Gangnam, a quick trip through the mountain, just about 15 min from Seoul Arts Center. It is a huge aerial that has hiking routes, a lift, a museum and a zoo. So definitely a destination where one can spend a lot of time. Once there it feels like it is hours from Seoul although it is very close, completely different scenery and environment there, quite relaxing. The zoo is quite large and has a large variety of animals. Grand Park is a great destination for a getaway."
242,4.0,"Public transport to and from Seoul Grand Park is easy; several buses are available and there is a subway station that leads directly to the park entry.  You can either walk, take the lift, or ride the miniature train(?) to the zoo or the theme park.  Entry prices are reasonable as are the lift and train prices."
243,3.0,"Primarily came for the zoo. It's a bit overwhelming in term of the size. The place is so huge and be prepared to do a lot of walking.  In term of animals, a bit disappointed. The only marine I saw was sea lion. No more dolphin. Didn't get to see many animals.  The only nice thing I like is the sky lift. If you visit must try sky lift."
244,5.0,"Among all zoos I visited in my life, I think this is the best! Environment is clean and animals seen are all appear healthy and happy! Many different animals/reptiles there and you would not be bored. Only thing is, do not go during Winter. It is quite cold. One more reminder - it is a non-smoking park."
245,3.0,"My kid loves animals so it was her 1st time in Seoul so I thought lets go and visit the Zoo, The entrance to the zoo is very far so once you get off from the Metro you arrive at 1 entrance from there you can buy a ticket on the elephant train and then get off at the zoo entrance. Once you get of the elephant train, you have to pay again to get back on it lol  The actual zoo is very large but due to winter most of the animals are kept inside, you can still see them but it would be better if you visit the Zoo after spring. The paths are slippery with ice so be careful.  Next to the zoo is Seoul Land an amusement park, it was too cold to go there so didnt bother."
246,3.0,"Good for long walk and if you have time.  Also a nice place for picnic.  Each area has separate entrance fees.  Sky lift is a must to see the scenery from above.  We did see much, some animals are not there during our visit. But we enjoyed walking due to cool breeze and autumn colors."
247,5.0,I love animals so Seoul Grand Park was great place for me. Place was clean and there were many animals. You can also cable car and see the beautiful view.
248,5.0,"A larger area with a museum, zoo and amusement park in it. Separat entrances and fees. Just a short subway ride out from Seoul and in a nice setting with mountain back drops."
249,5.0,"I went to the zoo and it was great all kind of animals were there. My advise to the people who wanna participate in activities like feeding the animals or playing with the dolphins to come after midday cause almost, all the activities starts in the afternoon starting 2.30 pm and also later. The attractions park is pretty big and the views are just beautiful you got the mountain and a huge forest it was perfect.  Ps: if you are planning to go to the zoo and to the attractions park it s better to free the full day cause just for the zoo it takes min 4 hours to see all kinds of animals. And its better to wear some comfortable shoes cause you walk a looot."
250,3.0,"Seoul's Zoo, the Grand Park, is located by easy metro ride from the city. Has lions, tigers, wolves, bears, and a good primate selection. Unfortunately all the bird exhibits are currently closed for health reasons and the dolphins have been returned to the ocean, so there are not any substantial marine life displays aside from seals. Animals seem generally well-read for, with some species benefiting from better habitats than others. Some of the wolves seemed a little sad, elephants seemed to have a very small space, and seals appeared cramped too. The zoo is in process of building some new enclosures and will hopefully improve those living conditions. Minimal English signage but enough to find one's way around. We visited on a Wednesday afternoon and the park was virtually empty, which made for a very pleasant time. Plenty of clean public restrooms and at least one convenience store in addition to numerous snack food vendors. Food prices not marked up. 0900-1900. $5 entry, $10 2-part skylift one-way. Take exit 2 from Grand Park metro, walk toward main building then turn right at building and walk 300m to the Sky lift. Recommend taking sky lift out to end of park and walking back to metro. We didn't think there was enough to see to merit buying more skylift passes."
251,4.0,"We went together with 2 other families and there are a total of 6 children (aged 2 to 8) and 6 adults. We only manage to go to the zoo though we bought the package price.  Generally, I am pleased to go there as my girl (aged 8) is the only child who is interested in seeing those animals (except that she is disappointed that she did not get to see dolphin there as the dolphins have gone back to nature.)  My younger daughter aged 6 did not enjoy seeing the animals as much as like the playground there ( similar as the rest of the other kids)  Good to allow the children to explore and see the real animals out there."
252,4.0,"We visited this Park in the night after 7pm, having taken around 50-min subway ride from central Seoul. The subway station nearest to the Park is named after the Grand Park itself.  We were there primarily to see the cherry blossoms. There were of course much fewer cherry blossom trees compared to Yeouido or Seokchon Lake, nevertheless, this Park is much more spacious and bigger and with fewer people as compared to the ever crowded Yeouido or Seokchon Lake.  The cherry blossom trees are to the left of the entrance to the Park. It was still a nice sight to behold even in the night, due to the brightly lit night lights. For the cherry blossom season especially, there was some nice, romantic decorations and also a row of 5-6 pianos freely available for visitors to play a nice melody to accompany the romantic ambience of the place. Could see many couples and families with children being enthralled by the place, taking we-fies and photos.  Overall, a nice place to visit in the evenings, after the main crowd visiting the zoo and other themed-attractions have left."
253,5.0,"One of the most picturesque autumn sceneries in Seoul! We had a grand time in this huge park! It was a very long walk from Exit 2 of Seoul Grand Park subway station to the park's ticket office. But it was a pleasant walk as the weather was just a bit nippy. We bought tickets for the elephant ride so as not to take a further hike to the park entrance. At the same time, we bought Sky Lift tickets (one way) for our ride back from the park to the main ticketing area. I highly recommend riding the sky lift! A fun and exciting way to see the park from above! The park is very well maintained. There is a bus that goes around the park with designated stops should you wish to ride while visiting different areas. Take a map at the reception area to serve as your guide."
254,5.0,"This park complex is accessible by train so easy to get to. This massive area consists of a park, gardens, zoo, amusement park and eateries, as all as a large contemporary gallery. There is also a chair lift system in two sections (which is VERY long and has beautiful views) as well as ground transport taking you from one attraction to the other (or back to the train station). Great for a half day out from the city or (especially if you have kids) you will need a whole day or more."
255,4.0,"For all flower lovers. Festival runs from May 27 - 12 June. Beautiful varieties of roses in different hues and decorations. Gorgeous for photographs, enjoy the beautiful flora or just relax and gossip/picnic in the shade like the locals. Probably much less crowded during weekdays, and some jostling with couples, young girls and ajummas for the best shots. Tis the season of love and as Robert Burns would say: My love is like a red, red rose That’s newly sprung in June My love is like the melody That’s sweetly played in tune. Opens from 9 am to 7 pm. Entrance fee KRW2000/head. Directions: Subway Line 4 to Seoul Grand Park station, exit 2. Walk straight till you reach the big fountain. Continue to the right for 15 mins walk to the Rose Festival or you can take the KRW1000 elephant shuttle and disembark at the first stop."
256,4.0,"If you have a day , in a good weather you may have fun with your children who loves to walk and explore animals . It's fun with young children. Suggest to load your food and fruits and enjoy ."
257,5.0,"The Grand Park is very big and for half a day I could not finish seeing just its zoo. The zoo requires a separate ticket and has a separate entrance far from the main park building. The zoo entrance is a good 15-20 minutes' walk from the main entrance and it is better to go firstly into the main entrance/ building and to buy a ticket (1000 KRW) for the elephant train to take you to the zoo entrance. The zoo has various animals, birds and insects. There is also an elevated bushland at the rear, but there is nothing much to see in there except some occasional fungi/ mushrooms. I like the bird aviary where one can find red crowned cranes; the aviary is quite large. On the weekend there are numerous children and the atmosphere is great. I would think that it takes more than one day to see the whole grand park."
258,4.0,"Had a great day at Seoul Zoo last week with two couples and three children. We love the ski lift that slowly takes you to the top of the zoo and lets you walk downhill all day! I thought the leopard , lion, tiger, and bear exhibits were great and now that the temperatures are dropping, they were much more active. Everyone loved the dolphin show which was the perfect length and featured both dolphins and sea lions doing neat tricks in an indoor amphitheater. We also enjoyed a nice picnic at one of the many picnic tables throughout the park. This zoo could use a little modernization and some of the exhibits were a bit tired, but it remains an overall great experience. Oh yeah, they have a baby elephant!"
259,5.0,"I had an Amazing time there. I've been there twice and that's because of how beautiful it is. And specially when you are an animal lover. It's perfect for couples, friends, families. I recommend going there when weather is nice. Not too cold not too hot. The view up there was absolutely breathtaking. It was like painting. قضيت وقت ممتع هناك وكان أجمل يوم قضيته في كوريا الجنوبية. ذهبت لهناك يومين متتاليين لشدة جمال المكان. انصح به بشدة لمحبي الحيوانات. المكان جيد للأزواج للأصدقاء والعوائل. انصح بزيارته عندما يكون الجو ربيعي. ليس حارا جدا ولا باردا جدا. المنظر عندما ارتفعنا على الكرسي المعلق كان أخاذاً.. كان وكأنه لوحة مرسومة وليس حقيقة."
260,5.0,We visited with a 3 year old and a 7 year old and we had a lot of fun. There is quite a bit of walking but there are trams and gondolas to ride. Quite a bit of animals to see and even a small amusement park area. We had great weather in Oct. Worth a visit if you have an entire day to spend.
261,5.0,"Great outdoor time with family and kids of all ages. There is a nice zoo, a fun amusement park and a museum. Easily reachable on subway line 4. A much better experience than Lotte World as far as the amusement park is concerned. Sometimes they have discounts for foreigners."
262,4.0,"Huge place. Very nice view of mountains behind it. The Zoo is pretty big and they have a lot of animals but the facilities needs to be improved. I don't mind going back tho, must see place if you're an animal lover."
263,5.0,"If you're ever in country and you want to experience the ""Big City Park"" you must definitely visit Seoul Grand Park, it has so much to offer from Sightseeing, Attractions, Rides(for children too), Archery, Ski Lift, Zoo and so many restaurants and snack bars its the perfect place to go for fun with the family or with your friends."
264,2.0,"We went there in August and it's too hot for us. We could only walked for half an hour and decided to leave. The zoo is pretty old. The staff is not good at providing information (as we walk along the way to the zoo from cable car station, we just realized that there a shuttle bus to the zoo but the woman at the information didnt tell us. So we have to walk under really hot weather)."
265,4.0,"The zoo is vast. Lot of animals. The chimps entertain. Take the skylift, sit and relax. Best thing is the dolphin and seal show. Ask for timings of the show at ticket counter. Sit near the front if you want to get wet. You can use the subway to reach there."
266,4.0,"The zoo is a part of Seoul Grand Park outside Seoul Grand Park station line 4.On weekends, take the subway...it's not worth all the traffic driving there.As you exit the station there is a long walk to the grand park main entrance. There will be some (imo) offputting smells, mostly form the boiling bundegi (silkworm pupae) Theres even a KFC and a convenience store...recommend you get some water as the zoo is big. You can get water and ddrinks inside as well. At the entrance of the park you can walk further to the zoo but that isn't recommended. Go to the booth and pay 1000won for a ride on the elephant tram. The tram hits all the sites at the park and drops you off infront of the zoo. You can also ride the skylift for about 5000won. The zoo is big. Frankly too big. What I mean is there are many of the different animal pavilions are separated by long stretches of trees and grass. So you're walking uphill a lot and seeing nothing for that time. It's nice if that's what you want to see but it seemed like a lot of wasted space. Some(many) of the animal pens were rather small. The monkey and ape sections were tiny. The park is relatively clean and there are plenty of food stall along the different paths. Unfortunately they all sell the same things like sausage, ""corndogs"", and fishcakes-on a stick. And coffee. Bad tasting coffee. The ""meats"" on sticks were pretty bad. Don't use the bathrooms here. Use at the subway or, if you have the time, go to the museum across the road...wonderfully clean there. You can take the skylift from the rear of the zoo and save yourself the walk. It's fun and you get a really wonderful view. Expect long lines when people are starting to leave. FYI, be aware of your clothes on the skylift. Adjust miniskirts when you sit. If this is your first trip to Korea you'll see people all over the place camped out on blankets and mats. They're not homeless. Don't give them change. The zoo is a very nice park to spend the day with friends or family. wear comfortable shoes. Bring snacks and water. Bring wet tissues."
267,5.0,"애들데리고 가기 너무 좋은곳, 가격싸고 볼거리 많고, 약간 많이 걸어야하는 경우가 있지만 약간의 운동은 모두에게 좋을듯. 입장료는 싸지만 케이블카는 싸지 않네요. 다양한 동물들을 볼 수있어 좋네요. If you want to visit a zoo that's not too pricey but has lots of things to see would be this place. It is really big place so get ready to walk for a bit. The zoo entrance fee itself is quite cheap but the cable lift is pricey. My kids love this place."
268,4.0,though it is publish that the zoo is 10th largest in the world there are some places that is a bit poorly maintained and no more animal display. i dont know if it is just for the start of spring. this is still inside the metro but a but far from where we stay in Myeongdong. though it is still connected to the Subway
269,5.0,"Very nice and big zoo, we were there for 5 hours and did not get to see everything. Even though it was quite busy on a Sunday, the park is big enough to not feel trapped in the masses. Some very nice pavilions (especially the tiger part), but also unfortunately some very small cages for certain animals. End of March is still a bit cold and some animals were thus still kept inside (which is good for them, no complaints on that as an animal lover), and the grass and flowers still have to set in. I certainly recommend the place, it's a must visit, but would advice to go mid April or later. Also very cheap (3000 WON for an adult)"
270,4.0,"You got to be well rested before you visit this place, wear comfortable shoes and pack some drinks and snack for it will take you the whole day to see this place. The seoul grand park is 3 parks in one. You have the Zoo, Seoul land theme park and Science museum. So all ages is covered! there is something for everyone! Different admission fees, For the zoo it is around W3,000 a bargain if you ask me. There is so much to see, just be prepared to walk since its a big zoo. Bigger than the one in Singapore. Although the design is an open/fenceless zoo, since it was winter, some of the animals were in their enclosures. You got to plan which animals you would like to see since there are trails (color coordinated painted on the floor). For the Seoul land theme park, I just took a look. Looks good from where i was standing. It is also big with rides for both adult and kids. Across the grand park is a new building which is the science museum. It closes around 5 pm so if you like to see this place, make it a priority before the other 2. Its a nice museum for kids."
271,5.0,"We took the chair lift into the zoo top end, to save on up slope walking. After getting off the chair lift, most of the animals can be seen up close thanks to the glass enclosures. Most animals can be seen fairly active and not hidden sleeping in their holes. Toilets are plenty in the whole zoo and kept clean. As it is not peak season, the kiosk selling snack food are close, which is alright as there are still indoor eating house to be found. I would high recommend this zoo for the opportunity to see the animals up close safely."
272,4.0,"I went to Seoul Grand Park in early November, and its a right time to visit the park if you wanna see the beautiful leafs change color into red or yellow.. Its a big and beautiful park in Seoul!"
273,4.0,"Lots of different animals, huge pavilons, especially bird pavilons, where you can pet your cockoo if it lets you :)) Dont miss the dolphin show! And probably you will be surprised how Koreans are obssesed with tigers :)) Tickets are very cheap. Recommend you to buy tickets to rose garden!!"
274,3.0,"Right outside the metro station, around 30 min by metro from meyongdong.  Has a zoo and amusement part section and rose garden. charges separately for each section, so you can just choose where u want to go. The park itself is free of charge, only need to pay for transport within the park: e.g. elephant train that circulates around the park stopping at the various sections and the 3 different ""sky line"" (its actually like ski lifts that goes across diff areas of the park). the scenery is quite nice as there's a pond and river with red leaves, many Koreans take a picnic there and families visit the amusement park and zoo."
275,4.0,"It is a nice place to see the nature inside the downtown of Seoul. Even we move around only at the Zoo, it took one day. When we arrived at the park, buy tickets to take the elephant shaped bus, cable car and entrace fees. Can see different kinds of lovely animals at there. The only thing is the taste of the food are not delicious at the restaurants and are expensive comparing with the taste. Street food of fried potatos and BBQ are okay. Also you can enjoy one cup beer with 2,500 Won. After one day trip in the zoo, we felt so tired of walking. Anyhow it is such a good place especially if you love animals."
276,5.0,"Even though it's located in the mountain, it's close to the city and it's a very nice place to spend a day. Recommended seasons are summer and autumn and in order to take advantage of the resources, you better take the cable car from the very beggining and go to the top of the park and then you start from the top to the bottom, otherwise you will have to take a walk up to the mountain and in consequence be more tired..."
277,5.0,"1. Very approachable, directly connected with subway, then short elephant or skyline journey to enter in. With 1 year old we preferred train. However the skyline are quite safe with netting beneath the path all the way so we returned through skyline. It is around 30 min with two changing stations. The mountainous surrounding are worth watch. A lovely sightseeing if that is your interest.  2. Very neat and organised. Follow orange, yellow, blue, brown line to have one particular tour like deer park, birds, African safari. dolphin route etc. We did dolphin and birds. Because the bird one is mostly within building with cooling that kept my baby comfortable. Dolphin show and seal show were 10 min or so. No extra payment.  3. Food outlets, toilets, nursing rooms are available all over for very cheap. Just carry picnic mat and buy food from there. They have burger king, cafe tiamo, c4u, Korean food restaurant and street food for cheap.  4. Hiring stroller is excellent idea. The stroller is very comfortable with enough room and shade. Do not carry your bulky ones. 2000 won for it whole day.  5. Forest bathing needs trekking and time. We skipped it for next visit.  6. Definitely one visit is not enough, too much walking, too much to see. If your kids are zoo lovers or you are bird watcher it is very very worth.  7. One day trip for 2 adults and a baby was covered in less than 40 000 won. This makes it all the more awesome. I am sure for a second visit. And, oh. ...It is ranked in top five zoo in the world 😊"
278,4.0,it is just zoo. can you take a train. and it so nomal if you vist spring or fall it's good but winter and summer is bed
279,2.0,"This was probably our least favorite of all tourist sites we visited while in Seoul. But I will admit that is probably clouded a bit by it being the last day of a 9 day visit and we were exhausted. We arrived by subway and the walk to the entrance to the zoo should have been our tip-off..it was so very loooong. A long walking avenue of sorts. Street vendors on both sides was the positive part. We enjoyed seeing and easting their wares. From there a walk across a huge entrance area to the loooong line for the ski lift to the entrance to the zoo. It is suggested you take the ski lift all the way up the side of the mountain and walk down the mountain through the zoo. This is a very wise suggestion. However, there is one lift that goes 1/2 way up, then you must switch to another to go the rest of the way. There was again a huge, sloooow line for the 2nd lift, so we opted to just go ahead and visit the zoo starting there. The zoo itself was very disappointing. It is billed as one of the largest zoos in Asia, and it may be as i haven't visited any others. But this is not a good zoo. There is a not a large variety of animals and their enclosures are extremely dated. The whole place felt kind of run down to me. We have visited, many zoos in the U.S. and each zoo always seems to have at least one exhibit that is special or unique...not here. It was fun to visit as a way to mingle with all the Korean families out of for day and to be outside, but not worth all the walking."
280,5.0,"Recently I conducted a photo workshop focused on photographing wild animals. Rather than trying to stalk and photograph the critters, we ramped up our odds of finding subjecs by heading off to the Seoul Zoo. Yeah, a zoo - a place that I had thought to be a rather lame place to take photos.  Well, I was wrong in so many ways. First, the Seoul Zoo is no longer that third class park with dingy animal exhibits and less than optimally cared for animals. The place is simply amazing. It's huge, clean, beautiful and a real joy to be during a fine spring day. The exhibits include many walk-ins, including a massive enclosure of cranes, storks and other waterfowl where the public can see birds wading, swimming and flying without any barriers other than a hand rail. There are other walk-ins for tropical birds where the birds literally flutter around you. And the tiger exhibit is really exceptional - but naturally not a walk-in exhibit!  Second, it's a great place to take photographs. Sometimes it's almost as easy as shooting fish in a barrel; but other times, such as trying to catch cranes in mid flight, one can appreciate what goes into quality wildlife photography in the field. Also, there were many young couples courting there with their ubiquitous selfie-sticks. Naturally, the place had more than its fair share of kids, but because the place is truly spacious, they were not underfoot as they could have easily been in a smaller park.  It's been decades since I've had such a good time at a zoo. The last time was the San Diego Zoo. The Seoul Zoo is not (yet) on the same level as the San Diego Zoo, but it is coming up close to that level. For W3,000 admission, the Seoul Zoo has to be one of the hidden gems of Korea.

281,3.0,"I visited the Gwacheon-located Seoul Grand Park and it was overall a positive experience. I only visited the zoo section, and not Seoul Land, the amusement park. For what it's worth my friends have told me that Seoul Land isn't really worth it, compared to Lotte World or Everland. The zoo features many animals, of all kinds and species and from all continents. There's pretty much everything you can think of : reptiles, big mammals, seals, éléphants, lions... The park is also perfectly located in between mountains and offers a stunning view. It also has a fairly large choice of dining and snack options. My bigger complaint with the park is that it feels a bit run down. Enclosures are fairly stale, and a some animals seemed a bit unhealthy. It also lacks some kind of a theme (safari, themes for different clades or cintinents), special events allowing greater interaction with animals or staff, as well as a session dedicated to children for example)"
282,5.0,Its is most amazing and entertaining place in Seoul. The place is full of exciting rides and even the most adventurous place. its lush green landscaping is one of the most unique.
283,4.0,"if u don't have your own car, u need to walk a lot from the near station.  seoul grand park has some attractions inside, amusement park, rose park, animal park. and then u can use a bus to move there in reasonable ticket."
284,5.0,"A great place to spend the day away from the City. We went early in the morning and had the zoo almost to ourselves for the first hour, before the school groups arrived. Not that they were a problem, quite the opposite. It was nice to see how well behaved and attentive they were as the learned about the different animals. The skyway was fun and saved us a walk and the plants and flowers both in the zoo and the park were beautiful."
285,4.0,"My in laws took me and my wife to the Seoul Grand Park. We only went to the zoo but it was well worth it . The spring blooms were popping all over the area despite the cool temperature. My mother in law needed a wheelchair to get around so we rented one from the park. Only problem was some steep hills but we all pushed her. Cost was minimal. Due to the sparse crowd were able to park near the entrance . The elephant train was also nice about a dollar per rider. Lot of coffee and food places were every where . They have canceled the dolphin show . But all other exhibits were available . The park is accessible by car and the metro. So there is also a carnival of rides for those who want to do it . Announcements were in Korean and English . If you have an afternoon you want to go, by all means go. They also have guide books in various languages to assist you."
286,4.0,"I love it! We went to the zoo, ride the sky lift and watched the animals. Botanical park are so lovely. The zoo itself is really pretty."
287,4.0,"The park in itself is a welcome break from the hustle and bustle of Gangnam. Entrance is free and you have the option to either walk all the way up or take a scenic tour via the cable car service. We visited on a Sunday; here, I observed how Koreans really value quality time with the family. There are benches an wide open spaces where you can go for picnics, drinking fountains are everywhere. Walking trails ranging from easy to difficult can be found all over the park."
288,4.0,"This is a lovely green park, south of Seoul. While most people come here to visit the zoo or the theme park, the park itself can be enjoyed for a long 1-2 hours of a peaceful stroll. The park is easily accessed by a nearby Metro (Seoul Grand Park station on line 4), but be prepared to walk some distances, as the park is huge."
289,2.0,"Perhaps I am just spoiled having recently visited a few zoological facilities in the United States and being from Columbus, Ohio where noted animal expert, Jack Hannah was the Zoo Director for many years and remains Director Emeritus. The things that I really liked about the Seoul Grand Park Zoo is it's ease of access. It is very easy to find and very easy to get to. That says a lot for a Korean city like Gwacheon, which is part of metropolitan Seoul. The grounds of Seoul Grand Park are expansive. It is a great place just to go and hike and you can see many locals who go there to do just that. The walk-ways double as access roads for shuttle busses and service vehicles, so they are very wide. The park is full of beautiful sprawling hardwoods and little island of green grass where you can sit and relax. Many have Korean-style wooden decks that are covered with aesthetic local-flavored covering and there are some places that are African themed with covered pavilions suitable for groups to relax. Seoul Grand Park is not ALL Zoo, but it has many different parts to it. At the parking lot you can find wide walking avenues lined with trees leading to the entrance to the general park. There are adequate western-style restroom facilities throughout the park. You have the option of taking a lift into the park or taking the ""Elephant Train"" which is just a Tow vehicle pulling several passenger platforms. Hold on to your children though--the driver only has two speeds, stop and escape velocity. The Elephant Train costs about 600 won each time you use it and it only takes you to the entrance of the Zoo and the other parks. I think there were three or four stops in all. Once at the entrance of the Zoo, the admission for adults is 3,000 won. They will only give you one ticket for your entire party and it will have the number of people on the ticket, so don't get separated before you go through the Zoo entrance. All that being said, once inside the zoo I was really disappointed at the obvious wear on the infrastructure. Everywhere you looked facilities cried out for a coat of paint and rust treatment. We came upon so many of the different ""herd"" animals and they were in vast outdoor enclosures. That's great for the animals I think, but they were so far away most of the time that you couldn't really observe them. Fortunately the park is loaded with casted replicas of the animals. It presents a lot of photo opportunities for the kids I guess. One of the things we really wanted to see was the Dolphin Show advertised on the English Web Page for the Seoul Grand Park Zoo. When we finally found the Marine Pavilion, the ticket windows had shutters pulled down inside. There were no signs showing the performance schedule or the admission price for the Dolphin show and we couldn't fined anyone around to ask. There were several marine habitats built around the perimeter of the Marine Pavilion, but they were not well kept. The water was dirty with a dark green tint and the walls of the habitat had not been repainted in years and there was a lot of places where paint had either worn away over years of neglect or chipped off the surface. I wouldn't be surprised if the Marine mammals had died over the years because of the poor conditions. After all, there was only one or two of each of the varieties of sea lions per habitat and they didn't seem too healthy. They rarely came out of the water and because it was so dirty it was nearly impossible to see them. I later asked an information attendant about the Dolphin show and she told me they hadn't had a Dolphin show in over two years despite being advertised on the English Web Page. From the looks of the outside of the Marine Pavilion I'd bet they are hoping to eliminate the marine exhibits by attrition as the animals die off. No I can't verify that, but the generally lacking upkeep of the Marine Pavilion and surrounding marine habitats, the lack of performances, and failure to care for the animals by just cleaning the scum out of the habitats or changing the water is highly suspect. I will give high marks to the Mountain Goat exhibit area. They have a manufactured rock cliff mountain that is really high and there was a huge herd of goats spread out on practically every available ledge and plateau and they were actively climbing up and down, passing each other on narrow pathways of rock--all looking quite natural. It was awesome to see how sure-footed they were and I felt this exhibit really captured the essence of the animals. The Giraffe habitat was also well done. There were three out in the open when I was there and they have a second-story platform where you can look at the eye-to-eye if they ever come that close. I really enjoyed the Meerkats too. There were only three in the exhibit, but it looked somewhat small. The interesting thing is that the pen was relatively small and they were only separated from patrons by a short Plexiglas wall. It would be easy for unsupervised children to feed them junk. I did notice that one child was eating something while I was there and one of the little Meerkats scurried over beside him and stood up just inside the Plexiglas waiting to see if there was anything edible coming his way. But it was fun to be able to see these little guys up close. They are adorable! The brochure that you get when you enter the Zoo says there are shuttle busses running around the park that will take you between venues or to the exit, but we were at all of the venues listed as stops in the brochure and we never saw a bus run. When I asked the information attendant as I was leaving she said the busses were running earlier in the day, but we were there for about 4 hours and never saw the bus once. If you want to go get some good exercise and be bathed by the sprawling hardwoods as you hike the hills throughout the Zoo and surrounding hills, this is a great place to go. After all, it costs only 3,000 won to enter. Perhaps that is the difference between the cleanliness and better upkeep in the Zoos I have visited in the United States--all of them have a much higher entrance fee. You'd pay $3 dollars or more for just a bottle of water in a US Zoo too, but here at Seoul Grand Park bottled water is only 1,000 won and they have free water fountains, food and souvenir/toy shops throughout the park. They have stroller rentals available as you enter the Zoo and there are also some coin-operated lockers available and I think they cost 500 won."
290,4.0,"I've read a couple other reviews here and I share generally the same sentiment. The zoo itself is incredible, there are tons of animals from all over the world to see. The rose gardens are amazing as well. I took a gondola ride that goes over everything and provides you with amazing views. I am however slightly concerned for the animals. You can literally put your hands about 3 feet from the cages and feed the animals food. I saw people giving the Gibbons cheetos. It was sort of funny, but I felt guilty watching it. Different country, different views on how a zoo should be run, but overall I had a great time."
291,4.0,"I am big fan of ZOO's in general and I was looking forward to see this ZOO. You have direct subway line to get there. ZOO was really cheap, like 3USD to enter for whole day. A lot of animals to look at. I loved it.  But, there is one point to mention: I do have worries about taking care of the animals there. You can see that animals are not in the best shape and not happy as well... Especially the cage for jaguars is very(!) small... So this fact was a dark side of my visit :(  But ZOO is in the beautiful environment, so you really feel escaped from the city."
292,4.0,"I like to visit zoos whenever I go on holidays. It rained a bit on the day of my visit though.  The zoo is actually within a huge park. To go around the zoo itself is similar to going on a nature walk due to its size. Some of the buildings were a bit old and run down though. The bird exhibits were all closed off to visitors although the birds were there (couldn't read the Korean signs saying why). Tiger exhibit was being renovated in new area. Other animals seemed to be relatively ""happy"" (compared to the animals in Tokyo Ueno Zoo which seem to have gone neurotic, i.e. walking in circles etc.)  Was very quite when I went, which was good."
293,5.0,"My honey and I spent a lovely day at the zoo in May. This place is huge, so comfortable shoes is a must. The lions and snake pit were by far my favorite. However I will say the food selection wasn't so great; just my opinion. Make sure to purchase the three part package deal."
294,5.0,"This place was amazing and so big we couldn't even do it all before we got tired and a little too hot for the day. There are many animals and they have nicely done enclosures. The guide map was in English but we found very few of the staff spoke English. However this wasn't too important as we wanted to just see the animals. They had an amazing dolphin and seal lion show that was included with the entrance fee. There was an impressive green house with many many different species of lovely plants. We also took the sky lift to get a birds eye view (and return to the front) and it wasn't very expensive. The zoo is non-smoking which was nice. There were several food options and one had a lot of good Korean food options with a serve yourself kimchi bar. There were colored lines along paths if you wanted to do a particular loop with each taking about two hours to complete. We didn't use these, but it was a nice option. Overall this zoo was enormous and very nicely done. We were glad we were able to visit and little sad we didn't get to see the whole place (or have time to to return again on another day)."
295,4.0,"We went to the zoo as well as Rose Garden. The Zoo is huge and we spent more than half a day there, taking our time to explore the whole park. Rose Garden is beautiful and there was a performance going on when we were there."
296,4.0,We went to Seoul Grand Park to go to the zoo. We had not realised just how gigantic this place is! There is a LOT to do there and we really could have spent more than a day and done more things.  The zoo is good generally although some of the exhibits were a little disappointing. I was a bit concerned about the welfare of some of the animals. But they are doing some things up so hopefully that will improve.  The surrounding area is fabulous. Lots of gorgeous views of the forest. Apparently there are lots of hiking trails too.  There is also a cable car option which we might do next time to get a better view!
297,5.0,Came here specially to see cherry blossoms and not going to the zoo. Love the entire park as the cherry trees were in full bloom and the crowd was not as much as Yeuido Park.
298,4.0,"Children's park, zoo, children's museum and more and most stuff is free. Wear good walking shoes and keep yourself warm!!!! Went in jan and March and will go back again"
299,3.0,went there in january really cold buts was a nice experience anyway I was well prepared for the cold and would not recommend going there in winter
300,4.0,"Nice BIG park, but avoid going in winter! There isamusement park but super expensive! Also an Art Museum but close on Mondays The Science park is opp this place so u can plan to visit both on same day."
301,2.0,"the weather was v cold yesterday and there were hardly any visitors. the area was huge, and it's difficult to tour the place with young kids due to the unbearable cold.  if you must visit, then here's what I would recommend. exit from the subway and walk straight ahead for 5-10mins, there is a building right in front. buy you tram ticks here. do not attempt to walk to the zoo with young children, it's a very long walk. 15mins at least.  the tram goes to seoul zoo and seoul land. alight at the zoo and proceed to buy zoo ticks and sky lift ticks. they are sold at different counters.  take the sky lift right to the top of the zoo and make a leisurely walk downhill. the sky lift is about 10mins, gives you a great elevated view of the entire area. worth the money in my opinion."
302,4.0,"Seoul's Grand Park is very huge, a 1.5 walk to the Seoul Zoo takes about 15 minutes.  The scenery is great - with tall trees, cool weather and the backdrop against the mountains I was there early in the morning, there were groups of Seoul's seniors up and about.  My expectations of zoos are on the high side as I am most familiar with the Singapore Zoo. Seoul's Zoo strikes me as vast. There are many animals to see, but it takes some time to walk to see them. A lot of food and beverage outlets were not open when I was there on a Monday morning.  It is also challenging for non Korean speakers to learn more about the animals, as most of the signboards have these information only in Korean - a little English will be certainly helpful!  I think the park is not a must-go, but will be good if you want to take a break from the hustle and bustle of the city.  I was here in October 2013 and the weather was slowly turning to autumn. For the full works of an Autumn about in Seoul, head there in November."
303,4.0,"I visited this place in october 2013 , the weather was really good for traveling around this place. All animals seem to be still fall asleep as we came (around 10am). This place is not smelly and well kept, and the track from one place to another is easy, they even provide free shuttle bus every 15mins. We watched Dolphin show for free, and somehow it's interesting .  Don't miss the Kangaroo feeding experience where we can try to feed them, and also the Bird paradise (awesome!!). To visit , use subway Line 4, Seoul Grand Park Station Exit #2 . Admission is 3000Won, and Skylift is 9000Won from entrance to Zoo (nearby lion and tiger exhibition). I recommend to use the skylift since the view of the zoo from upside is nice."
304,3.0,You can finish the zoo by walking. No tigers during my visit and the aquarium was closed. Lovely Giraffes though!
305,5.0,"This is a really nice zoo that is clean and beautifully laid out. It is also inexpensive. Be prepared to walk a lot but there are so many creatures to see. Our favourite was the nursery where we saw a baby orangutan, chimpanzee, Meer cat and 3 baby tigers."
306,5.0,"We are a family of four, we have a 9 year old daughter and a 3 year old son. We went to Seoul Grand Park on Sep 1 2013 and loved it. I would highly recommend taking the subway, line #4, stop SEOUL GRAND PARK. If you exit out of exit 2, you will walk about 1/4 mile to the SGP tram loading/unloading zone. I would recommend paying to ride the tram as the entrance to the zoo is about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile uphill (and trust me you are going to be walking uphill enough). The tram cost us 2,700 won. Although the tram area looks busy as all get out, trams came one right after another, only waiting about 30 seconds between trams. They moved us out like cattle! We were pleased with the tram. So, once the tram stopped, we bought our tickets to the zoo (they included a special ""theme"" ticket allowing us into another attraction, I am all but certain it was the rose garden, but we never made it), and we entered the zoo (9,600 won total, I could NOT believe how inexpensive it was). Ok, once in the zoo, either take the ski lift all the way up to the top and walk down and call it a day, or find a good spot to tighten your walking shoes. The walk to the top is uphill, you will earn your view of the lions and the other ""cats"", but it is well worth it. I've never been to a zoo that had over 6 lions, not lioness, lions! This zoo has it ALL, from Bison, Bears (so many), Dolphins to Deer. The highlight of the day was the deer eating out of my daughter and son's hand (although it's probably not recommended by the staff, if you have little ones than bring lettuce or carrots, my kids just fed them the green leaves they found on the ground and they ate them). We had absolutely no complaints about this zoo, in fact it blew away our expectations. Bathrooms extremely clean, convenient stores selling soda and snacks for regular prices (not jacked up because it's in a zoo, a soda was 900 won), and such a wide variety of animals. Tip #1 - allow a FULL day here. So, the end of the day we hopped back on the tram and we thought it would take us straight to the loading/unloading area we boarded the tram when we arrived....no. It made one stop at Seoul Land prior to heading back. Tip #2 - there is MORE at the Seoul Grand Park than the zoo!!! Who knew right?? Well, we do and we are definitely heading back soon! We had an incredible day!"
307,4.0,"Before I review the zoo at Seoul Grand Park, I must state it is always my preference to view wildlife in their natural habitat. It is a much more thrilling and worthwhile experience.  As far as zoo's go, Seoul Grand Park offers a variety of animals, with accurate information on the different species. All zoo exhibits are far too small for wild animals. But we should make it clear in modern-day zoos most animals are now bread in captivity or incapable of returning to the wild for a multitude of reasons. Zoo's today are primarily for education, not exhibiting ferocious, exotic, or bizarre animals just for the wow factor. Zoo management can always work to improve the conditions and how animals are ""shown"" to the public. I am therefore judging Seoul's premier zoo in comparison to others around the world. The zoo is comparable to many in the US, but certainly a peg below the San Diego Zoo in both diversity in species and exhibit quality. Seoul Grand Park is far better than any zoo in China (that I've seen), even with the exclusion of the much loved panda. The exhibits are cleaner, more spacious, and the signboards provide far more information than other zoo's I've visited in Asia (and some in the US).  I enjoyed my time here, the exhibits were often interesting. But like most zoos there were individual exhibits that just needed to be larger and better kept. This is by no means unique to Seoul Grand Park, even in the San Diego Zoo there are old exhibits that need renovation/expansion."
308,5.0,"The zoo was easily accessible from the subway station and the website provided the stops and exit information, which was very helpful for foreigners. We were pleasantly surprised by the view and location of the zoo. It was enclosed in a beautiful mountain area. The admission fee was extremely reasonable, but visitors will need to plan on spending an entire day there to be able to experience the whole park. We were there for almost five hours and were only able to see a little over half of the park. The animal exhibits were unbelievable. We saw so many different species of animals. It was a little rainy on the day that we went so some of the events were cancelled. The monkeys had all had babies recently so it was so neat to watch the mothers interact with their children. This is a family friendly place and a must see attraction when visiting Seoul."
309,4.0,"Seoul Grandpark is easily accessible via subway M4.  It is a grand park, and suits the natural lovers the most. THere is no entrance fee for the park, yet seoul government taken good care of it.  Recommendation :  a) Go via subway m4 b) Visit in the morning, the air was fresh c) Suitable for all family members d) Take the trains to go around the park, as the park is so huge and will be a burden to elderly e) Visit the zoo, entrance fee was 3000 won with many animals, so worthwhile f) Highlight of the Zoo : silverback gorilla, dolphin show at 1130am g) U may spend 3-4 hours easily there."
310,5.0,"I've visited this awesome place around october 2012 with husband and a daugther. Since we are from Malaysia, this is my first time visited seoul with this fantastic view in autumn season. Coming here not because of their animals but wanted to see and feel how colorful autumn trees look alike with our own eyes. One thing that my daughter like is sitting on the chairlift while we enjoy the very beautiful sceneries from above. t's a worth visit this place only in an autumn season for people like us."
311,5.0,"For the short time that we had in Seoul and the fact that we only relied on the subway to get to Seoul Grand Park, we were pleasantly surprised at the variety of birds to be seen there. The park is easly accessible by Seoul Metro, had KFC on the grounds and is clean and safe. Late March is really not a good time to see lots of birds but still, we still saw at least thirteen new bird species in a space of four hours!"
312,4.0,"Snow boarding and the rollercoasters, also i find the shooting range very interesting. one good point is the beauty of the scenery."
313,4.0,"Guess choosing to go in winter was both a good and bad idea.  The brutal cold was not forgiving, but the view was worth every shiver and frostbite I suffered. The zoo being surrounded by mountains, which made the view amazingly beautiful and the streams within made the view even prettier. There was buses to bring visitors around the zoo, which was fairly big, but it is definitely a good workout.  The zoo was not catered for visiting in the winter as most of the enclosures were closed, and animals being put indoors, where it was heated. The conditions of the indoor enclosures was pretty bad and the smell was pungent and took getting used to.  What I loved most though, was the baby animals section where we got to see various animals up close just separated by a glass panel. Seeing the baby leopard up close was amazing .  Would return again to have a look at the animals in their natural enclosure if I ever go again in spring or autumn. Mainly because of the affordable admission and the wide variety of animals we can see. But this time, I would take the free shuttle and not walk the whole area. =P"
314,1.0,"The conditions these animals have to live in is awful. The zoo owners clearly care more about attracting visitors than they do about their animals....their winter habitats were concrete jail cells, and most animals looked visibly unhappy/underfed. The habitats set up for the warmer months didn't look any better, really, and pretty much just looked like cages instead of places to make the animal feel at home. I was so sad by the time I left, and couldn't even bring myself to see the whole zoo. Please don't support them, and rather go to a zoo that takes care of their animals properly."
315,5.0,"My family went there during early winter just after the first major snow fall for the year. Seoul zoo is nested in the Seoul Grand Park cluster easily accessible via subway. The place was quiet, peaceful and fabulous. The team tried their best to make the visit enjoyable by pointing us in the right directions as the animals from the warmer are kept in in-house shelters. Not a zoo expert but the big cats, dogs, birds of prey and deers appear well-fed, energetic and expressive,  There are plenty of snow for snow fights as well.  In my view, it truly deserve to be recommended for a visit especially for kids. Price-wise, the ticket price of KRW7,000 per adult is very reasonable given the long and scenic cable ride from the entrance, the shuttle to the zoo entrance and the energetic animals."
316,4.0,A lovely place with lots of interesting nooks and crannies. I was certainly glad of the ski lift taking us back down when we left though. I was too tired to walk all the way back down after a day of exploring.
317,2.0,"I love animals and I love zoos -- when animals are treated right. This zoo was not one of those places. The animals were thin, some with fur missing. Animals paced back and forth. The cages were small, concrete slabs (not habitats). One cage no bigger than my bachelor/studio apartment had 3 cheetahs in it! Even the grounds themselves were drab. I do not recommend going to this zoo -- there are plenty of better ones that treat animals kindly and with respect."
318,4.0,"Grand Park is located near subway station 437. It is better to buy pass for two cable ways (9,000 W per adult - one-way). After first one you need to buy entry pass to Zoo. Second cable way is longer. Then it is pleasant to go through Zoo down. There are lot of different animals and birds. Some of them are especially pretty."
319,3.0,"There were a lot of animals here, but I didn't feel that their enclosures were up to international standards. Many seemed very small and sparse - some looking just like jail cells."
320,5.0,Seoul Zoo is a great place with or without kids. There are many different animals to see in a huge park. It is very well maintained with lots of interactive displays. Including many places to eat & drink.
321,4.0,"This was a great experience taking the kids out for a day of fun! The roller coaster rides for kids are awesome and they will feel like they experienced a real thrill, but that it was not scary. One of their favorite rides was the water roller coaster!"
322,5.0,"The two places I have enjoyed visiting at Seoul Grand park are Seoulland Amusement Park and Seoul Zoo. My day at Seoul Zoo was especially enjoyable, it is a nice area to walk around, there are two different sky lifts one in the lower area and another at the top part of the Zoo which is on a fair slope. We enjoyed the sky lift so much with its fantastic views that we took both skylifts up to the top of the hill, walked around the various attractions and took the lower sky lift back down again as we thought it was neat! The other thing we liked the most was the dolphin and seal show. It was the best I have ever seen and I recommend everyone to go to it but the queue to get in is always very long so buy your ticket for a later show, go and look at some of the animals then come back at least 30 minutes before show time and get in the front of the queue if you want a front row seat."
323,5.0,"Here you can find Seoul Land an amusement park, a science museum for kids, a zoo, a contemporary art museum, race track and more! There is a tram you can ride as it is quite far to walk from place to place."
