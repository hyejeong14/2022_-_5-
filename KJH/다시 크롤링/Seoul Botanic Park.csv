6,3.0,Ive visited for my baby in winter Because i heard that its quite warm inside but its was not really good than i expected  I think its better to visit during  summer so you guys can look around outside When i visited theres nothing outside but i still have to pay the same amount Even theres nothing outside whats the reason

11,5.0,I liked it a park kept in a maniacal way the only flaw that a park lacks a basket where you can throw a paper perhaps for the separate collection that in Korea is respected by everyone even by children

17,1.0,Committed a day to this needed an hour or so To be honest one of the most boring gardens Ive ever explored Most of the plants are in mediocre shape and there arent any particularly beautiful or special plants or flowers  The inside conservatory is split into two parts Tropical  Mediterranean In the Mediterranean section are a ton of cacti from the USA and plants from New Zealand and Australia as well as some plants from other far flung places by very definition NOT in the Mediterranean  Poorly maintained and poorly organized Compare this to other botanical gardens in neighboring countries and it is a joke If you want an afternoon out wandering around average plants then its not bad but if youre expecting to see some beautiful or special plants youre better off exploring google or finding another garden somewhere else in Korea

22,2.0,"Doesn't accept cash payments anymore, barring access to people who don't have/don't want to use a credit card. If I had known this, I wouldn't have bothered. The only redeeming feature is that is surrounded by a nice (free) park.  P.S.: fear of the virus is a poor excuse since cards can be just as filthy as cash. May I suggest providing visitors and staff with hand sanitizer instead."
23,4.0,"Great walk in the Botanical Garden, not the same as in summer or spring of course, quite new so everything needs to grow more.Strolling around and enjoy the walk in the fresh air. Try to to find the time to do this.In february can be very cold so dress accordingly !"
24,5.0,I was pleasantly surprised when I visited the botanical garden. It has opened relatively recently at far western end of Seoul. The glasshouse is designed like a lotus leaf and quite beautiful itself. You can walk a sky-bridge and see plants from above too.
25,5.0,"If you love plants, this is a must visit place. There are different variety of plants in the garden and trees in the park.  Directions: Take Exit 2 of Magongnaru Station (Line 9) and walk approximately 1 km"
26,5.0,"I just visited last Sunday and truly enjoyed myself. It’s a close walk from the station and it was easy to get there from south Seoul by the express train. The garden itself is lovely...and nicely decorated. Divided into various country areas with some fascinating plants and fruit trees. It’s still quite new, so the place inside as well as outside the restaurant feels fresh and nicely kept. Walking around the greenhouse garden made me really happy. It’s a nice place for a date too. There are spaces to explore within the building attached to it and I found interesting displays. Furthermore, there are other nature areas outside attached to the garden such as wetlands which I didn’t explore because I spent around 3 hours within the botanical garden and later had a nice meal in the 6th floor. There is a korean cafeteria and a Italian/fusion restaurant. I had herb bibimbap and it was really good. I’d like to go back here again and explore outside areas next time. As I can only attach 10 photos here, more pictures are on my Instagram @katfuz"
27,5.0,"If you are a botanical lover, so this is it! The first botanical garden in Seoul and it's really nice even in the middle if a hot day."
28,4.0,There are beautiful flowers and plant in the park. One will take at least half a day to roam around the place. A plus point is that it is located near to metro station. Some of the flowers are gorgeous and if at the right time of the year one can even see Sakura there.
29,5.0,"This is a fine botanical park which is under preparation. Currently, they allow a free temporary visit for limited facilities. Good to visit for families and couples. For tourists to enjoy flowers too.  - Not famous yet. There aren't many visitors. - The grand opening is May, 2019. Prior to that, it opened to the public on Oct 11, 2018. Many facilities were still under preparation when we visited. - The entrance is free for some time. - A huge park with kid playgrounds, exhibition halls, flower gardens, snack bars, cafeterias, etc. - The main botanical garden is the highlight and very amusing. Lots of interesting plants, balloons, a sky bridge, etc.  - How to reach: AREX & Line #9 Magoknaru is right outside the entrance. Line #5 Magok is pretty far to walk. The location is a bit away from the center of Seoul.  - Good to enjoy cherry blossoms and fall foliages.  - The pond is large and so peaceful. There's a huge I Seoul U sign near the pond.  - The park is supposed to reach until Hangang(Han River). But, it was under construction when we visited."
