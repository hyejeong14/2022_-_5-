53,3.0,"Gwanghamun Square is not really an attraction in itself in my eyes, it is a big open square in front of Gwanghamun Palace hence it is hard to miss and as the palace is a must visit for any tourist in Seoul chances are you pass by this square anyway. There are two large statues, good for a picture, and to the left and right office buildings and the American Embassy. From there anything in Gangbuk can be easily reached, City Hall is just down the road so in Cheonggyecheon and many other sights. Just one thing to keep in mind is that this square is also often used for demonstrations, all peaceful of course, but when seeing lots of police and masses of people you know what is going on."
54,5.0,One of the most popular touristic spots in Seoul. Good to visit. - The best time to visit is when it has the least protest. - The cascaded water path having the tree of Korean kings on the ground is impressive.
55,5.0,"Square is amazing, super beautiful and well worth the stop. I would highly recommend avoiding on Saturday due to protests, it does not make it in passable but more difficult to traverse."
56,3.0,"If I am reviewing the square itself then I would say it's a concrete slab of open space surrounded by streets and buildings on all four sides. It's not as large as the one in Beijing but is still quite impressive in its hugeness. Yes, there are a couple of impressive statues of long departed men that are good for a photo op but other than that there is nothing to do here.  However, come on a weekend when one of many public protests occur and now we have something to talk about. When I visited there was a massive (think 10000 people or more) protest against the sitting government and calling for increased solidarity with the US. Without getting political, I found the energy, excitement and noise to be quite contagious and tbh, deafening. This is where the square comes alive... speeches, music, flag waving, videos, marches, chants, police, pamphlets, angry people, happy people, confused people. And I guess it is the square with its openness and inviting stance that enpowers its citizenry to gather and demand change in one collective voice. Therein lies the purpose of a square... I guess."
57,3.0,"Just down from the two large palaces you will find this quite interesting square in the center of the road containing a statue of King Joseon (sitting) and Admiral Yi Sun Shin on a Pedestal.The square also has some interesting potted trees.The Admiral was famous for his battles with the Japanese during their invasion in the 16th Century, at the time Josoen was on the throne."
58,4.0,"Just 10 years ago, this public square replaced 10 traffic lanes as part of various environmentally friendly renovations going on in Seoul. The big rectangle runs from Gwanghwamun Gate on the North to Sejongno Sageon intersection on the South. We walked its length from the intersection, en route to Gyeongbokgung, the city’s premier palace on a Saturday afternoon. I saw no greenery anywhere on the square to soften the effect of its vast concrete underfoot, but many attention-grabbers beckoned, including two big statues.  We encountered the first statue almost immediately, at the Southern edge of the square. It depicts a standing Admiral Yi Sunshin (1545-1598), who led the defeat of the Japanese Navy in the Imijin War. A nearby fountain, known as the 12.23, commemorates the admiral’s 23 battles with 12 warships during that war. The second statue, also nicely crafted, appears in the middle of the square, showing King Sejong (1397-1450) seated on a throne. Among other accomplishments, he created the Korean alphabet.  While looking around the king’s statue, we discovered an entrance at the rear that led to a lower level with two free exhibition halls focused on the king and the admiral. History buffs, we spent about 1 hour here, learning fascinating information about both men. Returning to sunlight again, we came across a book fair on the square, where many events are held for the public.  Three traffic lanes flank both the East and West sides of the square and a Metro entrance is in the square itself. Government administrative offices appear beyond the lanes on the East Side and the Sejong Center (performing arts), which we also visited, is the standout building on the West side."
59,4.0,The square is large with 2 huge statues of Korea's historical figures. And in the background you can see the mountain and the palace.
60,2.0,A busy main road with a central area surrounded by a few civic buildings sums up the square. Not much to see except a couple of statues and lots of traffic. Leads up to Gyeongbokgung Palace and gate.
61,3.0,Not much to do here other than see the statues. I presume they have events here throughout the year. Seems to be popular with tourists. In a great area as there are lots of coffee shops and restaurants nearby. Good to visit after the palace as it’s just outside.
62,4.0,This is the massive and impressive public square in front of the main entrance to Gwanghwamun Palace and its full of interesting statuary and plenty of plaques explain things that used to be there and things that still do! Great views of the palace and its main gate. Loads of life and bustle about and its very close to the main shoppibg areas and lots of eateries.
63,5.0,"Great historical figure, lots to learn about the Korean alphabet and their way of thinking based on this historical figure"
64,4.0,"This square is just in front of Gwanghwamun Gate, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace. The square has 2 imposing statues, ie King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sun-Sin. To know more about the 2 figures, suggest you visit the underground museum, located just behind the statue of the king. Free admission. Nice to spend about 10 to 20 mins enjoying the air con and use the toilet before moving on."
65,4.0,"This is a very formal and grand public square in honour of the well loved Emperor Sejong.  There is a museum in the basement (free admissions) which is below the statute of the Emperor. Look for the interesting displays on the history of Korea, Hangeul language and the lifestyle of the early days.  You could watch a short movie, which is very informative, in this small museum.  Back to the Gwanghwamun Square, there are many spots for nice photos."
66,3.0,"An imposing square -- with a Joceon Palace to the north and statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sun Shin adorning the median. Obviously not worth a trip, but when in the area it makes for a lovely stroll (as long as there are not more anti-American demonstrations along the way, since this is also the site of the US Embassy)."
67,5.0,So magnificent! I loved majestic architecture in this place. I also loved the way that the guide introduce me the history of Korea and this attraction.
68,4.0,Absolutely loved the mountains in the background and to see the palace in the distance. The statue is very well made. At the sides of the square is a floor plaque for each year with something written next to it (wasn’t in English so unsure what it said but I found it really intriguing). I loved the buildings and really feeling like you were in Seoul.
69,4.0,"Along this busy street are many statues and historical markers to Korean history. This is where parades, events and demonstrations happen. At the end of the street is the palace. Well worth walking the entire length."
70,3.0,The statute is massive and situated right in front of the palace entrance so it can’t be missed. We went early and managed to avoid the crowds.
71,4.0,"We were walking through the square, saw the massive statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sunshin, so we decided to stop in. I found this museum very engaging for being devoted to only two historical figures. Turns out the King Sejong created the Korean language and was an early model for the value of scholarship. Admiral Yi's story is simply amazing and the exhibits in that portion of the museum are fantastic. We intended to just have a quick look and ended up staying for two hours. We were pleasantly surprised. Also, the museum provides (for a charge) activities for kids. We loved making the wood cut prints - my kids still have theirs! If you have some time, stop in and see what this museum has to offer!"
72,5.0,"On my way to palace G and N market, you can’t miss this square. Easy to walk through, very interesting statues (king and admiral) what is explained. Try the underneath museum. Really good to get a taste of Korean culture and history."
73,4.0,"An impressive and centrally located area where you can find colourful water fountains at night, the Statue of Admiral Yi Sun-Sin and Statue of Sejong the Great amongst others. There is also the Memorial to the Sewol Ferry Victims which currently dominates the park as well as a man with a sign protesting the presence of American troops in Korea.  However, for us the most memorable was the memorial to the Sewol ferry victims where 250 students died in a tragic ferry accident. The memorial shows photos of the students and allows donations too."
74,3.0,Wind blowing will make your face frozen when walking in this square. King Sejong's underground memorial/museum can be your savior to escape the winter cold. Nice to walk in this square until you reach Gyeongbokgung Palace.
75,4.0,"Visited Gwanghwamun Square to take photos of the King Sejong statue. When I arrived at the statue, I found that there's a museum dedicated to the king down under the statue. Admission into the museum is free and there's no crowd at all. Worth visiting."
76,4.0,we had to line up to take photos of the statue of King Sejong which is 6.2 meter high. we also visited the museum dedicated to honor him near this statue. must see.
77,4.0,This square is in front of G Place and not to be missed as it has huge statues of two prominent people who shaped South Korea and a underground museum. One can spend a few hours here during early morning and during evening go around this square which a water fountain and plants blooming with flowers of various colors on the side path. This square is also used for various cultural and political activities as adjacent to this square there is a row of foreign embassies. The day of our visit a meeting between the North and South korea was scheduled and there were many groups which were celebrating as a mark of this historic occasion. We were served local delicacies and sweets and we all danced with them and participated in their prayer. The G square houses huge bronze status of King Sejong who is believed to have consolidated the Joseon Dynasty and also the founder of Korean alphabet. There is also a bronze status of the 16th Century Japan-Korean war hero Admiral Yi Sun Sin in a standing posture holding a sword. In front of this status is a water fountain having 23 jets symbolizing the 23 battles he fought. There is also an underground Musuem built in the memory of this King & the Admiral.
78,5.0,Part of the beautiful boulevard that leads to the Palace. Enjoy a leisurely walk past reminders of Korea's history. King Sejong who brought the Korean script to life.
79,3.0,"There are often markets on the square and the views of the palace are great, the square is also very centrally located and surrounded by interesting buildings."
80,5.0,"The Gwanghwamun Square is a large, long, thin, traffic free area which extends down from the Gwanghwamun Gate to the statue of Admiral Yi Sun-sin of the Joseon Dynasty. Apparently it is a protest free zone. On the weekend that I stayed in Seoul the whole area was taken over by many small, tent like stalls with groups, mainly of school kids & young people in a massive arts and crafts event. I liked the fact that at least two locations on the square (it's more like a long thin stretch of land between two large thoroughfares), they had built stages and people were performing different forms of music and dance. I sat around for quite some time in the warm October sun enjoying free entertainment on both the Saturday and Sunday afternoons.  In addition to the imposing statue of the Admiral there was also one of King Sejong the Great of Joseon who created and introduced ""Hangul"", the native phonetic writing system for the Korean language.  Nearby you have the City Hall, the Cheonggyecheon stream and, of course the whole Gyeongbokgung Palace complex. And the well ""fortified"" USA embassy is close by as witnessed by the fairly significant police presence."
81,4.0,"Located in front of Gwanghwamun Gate, so that was nice! The fountains and statues were good to see, happy I went!"
82,5.0,"I think most tourist would only take pictures with or of King Sejeong and thing surrounding it and not go to their museum. The museum btw is free entrance so if you want to take a deeper look on your travel, you must go there. There aren't a lot of people inside and there are a lot of things you can learn from the place.  Anyway, I do love how this place is just near the Gwanghwamun gate and when you take your pics, you have it as you background. This place is definitely a must and it's also near Cheonggyecheon stream."
83,4.0,"Gwanghwamun Square leads to Gwanghwamun Gate - another attraction nearby but for us the entire square was worth doing. From the fountains to the statues and sculptures, not to mention just watching things go by. We enjoyed our time here."
84,4.0,"This is a big plaza in front of the Gyeonbokgong. There is a huge statue of King Sejong, who invented the Korean alphabets."
85,3.0,"Gwanghwamun is not really a square but a large rectangle in the center of Seoul, directy in front of Gyeonbokgung Palace. There are two famous statues in the middle of the square which divides the highway in two. Many tall buildings are on each side of the street."
86,5.0,"I much preferred our recent visit to Gwanghwamun Square than in the past, it was full of atmosphere with a local community fair in progress as well as a large memorial to a recent disaster in Korean to view and ponder, it certainly was a busy public square. Also there are two fabulous statues of great Korean people, Admiral Yi Sun-Shin and King Sejong who have left their mark on Korean society and culture, check out the fun water fountain, most likely enjoyed more in warmer months. At the far end of the square, away of from the business centre, is Bukaksan Mountain in the distance with Gyeongbokgung Palace in the foreground. There is no shade on the square so sun protection is required and recommend a good pair of walking shoes for an enjoyable day out in Seoul."
87,5.0,Great statue of one of the most important man in the history of Korea. He invented the Korean script to replace Chinese characters. Very spacious to walk around and take pictures.
88,4.0,When we were there this year the square was set up for viewing of World Cup matches so there were many tents round the statue of King Sejong the most revered monarch in Korean history who created the Hangul. We had a nice wander around and saw the statue of Admiral Yi where there was a mountain. There was a moving memorial exhibition about the Sewol ferry disaster where bodies of a number of people have still not been found and families are still waiting for an investigation to be done and those responsible held to account. The square is really impressive esp as you walk towards Gyeongbokgung and the mountains behind it. A must visit site when in Seoul - easily accessible to Cheonggyecheon and other sights.
89,5.0,Nice place to walk around and see thing a lot people here they hangout and do a lot of different thing ! A lot a shop and coffee shop also!! Beautiful view of the mountains too and very clean!!! And very safe!! I will be there in June 5 2018
90,4.0,It looks like a mini festival in here with so many small shops and vendors around. Though it might be a little expensive to buy items from here. The square in itself gives a good feeling if the weather is good. Recommend spending an hour walking around the place. I got a paper engraved in Korean with a popular saying which was pretty cool as well.
91,4.0,"Gwanghwamun square located so close to Gyeongbokgung palace, just across the street. Nice place to stroll around."
92,5.0,This area in the front of the Gyeongbokgung palace is a very nice place to be. It is a great area which give you several connections to other nice places. The big staties remind to the history of Korea. You can free walk in the middle of this grand street
93,4.0,"Gwanghwamun Square's located in front of Gyeongbok Palace and connected to Cheonggye Square. At the square had King Sejeong Statue and at the back of the statue is The Story of King Sejong (세종이야기). Moreover, its also had a statue of General Yi Sun-Shin, who had victories against the Japanese navy. And now the square had located Sewon's victims recapture tents."
94,4.0,"It was a very impressive square. The area was huge and there was Gyeongbokgung Palace and Bukhansan National Park in the background. The square contained imposing statues of Admiral Yi Sun-sin, a military leader and King Sejong the Great of Joseon, the creator of the Korean alphabet.  As we walked towards the statues we passed a memorial for the victims of the 2014 MV Sewol ferry disaster, most of whom were students. There was a tent set up with information and it seemed that the families of the victims were still searching for answers. It really pulled at the heart strings."
95,4.0,It is a huge square with lot of rich history especially on the King who created Hangeul. It also shows the different things that he has founded or created.
96,5.0,This city square highlights the best of Seoul. A touch of history at one end mixed with the modern day hi tech world. As you walk from the LED screen billboards towards the Palace grounds. You can see many historical statues and city buildings. Try to get up to the palace gates prior to 10am to see the changing of the guard ceremony.
97,4.0,"Take a picture of the famous statue on this square. and a very near to the Gyeongbokgung Palace.  On the weekend, there so many crowd and people walking in this square. If you need to take a good, quite picture. try in the early morning 7-8am.  Sometimes this square has a lot of demo and people marching to protest or make some campaign related with government or organization/activist."
98,4.0,"Be there before 8am to avoid the crowd, it is different to walk in a wide street without anyone around you. Great opportunity for photograph. Enter the palace and watch guard changing shift at 10am."
99,5.0,"My friend and I walked from our place going to Gyeongbokgung Palace, before arriving you will pass by first at this beautiful and historical square. The square is heavily guarded. The statue of King Sejong the Great is located in the middle of the square. For us, we felt it was an additional free treat, who did not expect to pass by in this place before reaching the palace. This site offer another glimpse of the colorful history of South Korea. The statue is really huge and attract tourists. Worth for photo opportunity."

102,5.0,"big statue in the middle of the road, in line with the Gwanghwamun gate, gyongbokgung palace & national folk museum"
103,4.0,Most statues are just that....a statue. As a photographer I took it as a bit of a challenge to get a good photo. Just down the street from the Gwanghwamun Gate of the Palace. A quick easy walk and you are there. Another spot for locals and the selfie craze!!
104,4.0,"it is like a must-see but i won't be that WOW. but the square is quite big and you may see a prison-like building there, which is the US embassy... it is a quite bizarre view"
105,5.0,"We visited this place on our way to Gyeongbokgung. We took exit 9 from Gwanghwamun Station. We were so amazed to see to the King Sejong statue with mountain and palace. It felt so huge. Under this area, there is a museum about King Sejong and all his efforts to invent hangeul."
106,3.0,"Large outdoor area nice for a walk, specially when there are exhibitions or markets like food festival are there. You can enjoy the walk while trying different foods and chat to nice Korean people."

There, you'll find a statue of King Sejong the most venerated king of Korea and, further down, a statue of Admiral Yi Sunshin, a naval commander noted for his victories against foreign invaders. A good place to stretch after being in the palace crowds."

Loved the square and a random festival was going on while we passed through. The palace on the end of the square was amazing! I was surprised Seoul was so clean and modern.
115,4.0,"Gwanghwamun Square is a lovely square that was opened in 2009. It is located across from the Gwanghwamun Gate to the Sejongno Sageori intersection. The Royal administrative buildings known commonly as Yukjo-geori (translated to Street of six ministries) are located here.  The square is divided into six sections. Towards the centre are two statues. The first is the bronze statue of King Sejong The Great. The second is the statue of Admiral Yi Sun-sin who was a naval commander during the Japanese invasion in the late sixteenth century.  On either side of the square is the Waterway of History. There is also a fountain. In front of the statue of King Sejong is a sundial, a rain gauge and a celestial globe – all invented by him.  There is a gallery nearby which houses the exhibits of the King."
116,4.0,"Viewing this square is more about the people and the politics that the statues in the square. Whilst the statues themselves might be of interest to a historian, around the square you will see people protesting and campaigning for various things. It's worth taking a local who will tell you what's going on with the current state of (very interesting) affairs in South Korea and it's relation with the rest of the world."

During our stay, there are some activities in this area: booths for remembering the victims of the ferry accident, concert, choir performance and protests. Since English is not always used by Korean, most of the time we had no clue of the nature of the events."

126,5.0,"There are various ways to get to this place. The nearest would be Gwanghwamun Station (Seoul Subway Line 5), Exit 1, 2 & 8. It is just opposite Gyeongbokgung and near one part of the Cheonggyecheon stream so you can cover a few places within a day. There's also a King Sejong museum which I didn't get to visit due to the timing. There's a Sunday flea market (information accurate as of 2016) at the square too, can check it out if you pop by on a Sunday."

129,5.0,Not everything is as at seems. The statue is only a top of the iceberg. Under the statue is entrance to a large museum area that I recommend visiting. It is very interesting to read about King Sejong and also to learn about the battles at sea with the Japanese navy in ancient times. Highly recommend it.
130,5.0,The great statues tell some history of Korea and are an impressive site to see. But there are also still the people demanding the truth about the Seawol accident.
131,4.0,This is just outside the Gyeonbokgung Palace. The monuments are really nice. If you're lucky you will see a flea market where at one stall Hanbok is sold. So rather rent why not buy the entire get up. That would be a nice souvenir!!
