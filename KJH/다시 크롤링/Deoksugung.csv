248,4.0,Locating before City Hall this place is easy to access comparing to other palaces of Seoul With only 1000 won you can experience minor version of Gyeongbokgung or Changdeokgung Good place to take a walk and have fun Stone fence around the palace is also popular to visitors After watching palace escape through the gate and circle around The best time to visit is from early to mid November with fall foliage
249,4.0,A small palace compared to that of Gyeongbukgung and Changdeokgung This palace is perfect for those who wanted to visit one but do not have much time The palace allows visitors to understand the ancient Korean culture There is a change of guard ceremony at fixed timings here
250,5.0,This is probably one of my most favorite Palace in Seoul definitely in the top three It seems like it lies in the center of Seoul the way it is positioned surrounded by modern architecture of Seoul hotels restaurants the City Hall and other important buildings Its so easy to get to by train bus or taxi and it is within walking distance to other attractions The Palace house also a gallery and a shop Its great to stroll around these old buildings and imagine how life might have been way back in the Joseph Dynasty Right outside of the Palace in the small street on the right of it lies a famous Belgian waffle shop which Id recommend trying Its not Korean but it is claimed to be one of the top 5 dessert shops in Seoul
251,5.0,There is a common believe that most South Korean Temples look pretty much alike and that is an undeniable truth Nonetheless there is a hidden differential beauty on each one of them Here at this temple we could appreciate the differences  This palace also has a lot of dynamic history as has been occupied not only by the Korean Royal family In 1897 after the incident when Emperor Gojong took refuge in the Russian legation he returned to this place and named it Gyeongungung again During the Japanese occupation of Korea in 1592 the residential buildings became a temporary royal residence after all the other palaces were destroyed by fires  Many of the structures here have since been removed or sold In 1933 all buildings except for a few central and western style buildings were removed It was then made a park and opened to the public  At the end of the trail you may walk youll find a turquoise Blue Fountain European looking On the left of this you will find a smaller part of the palace detached unit and on the right of the fountain youll be right in front of the Deoksugung National Museum of Modern  Contemporary Art  Its important at the door to purchase the full package ticket so that you can appreciate both Palace and Museum  Since 2007 restoration work to restore Deoksugung Palace to its original specifications  This work has been ongoing We do recommend extensively this palace although we couldnt appreciate the full beauty as it has been a bitter winter this January but in Spring must be definitely wonderful  Dont miss it
252,5.0,I visited 2 palaces Deoksugung  Gyeongbokgung during my visit to Seoul last month though Deoksugung is not as big as Gyeongbokgung but Deoksugung is quite unique compare to Gyeongbokgung You can find both Joseon Dynasty  Western influences in this palace something that you cant see in another palaces in Seoul 
253,5.0,Why pay for tour guides when you can hop on and off the subway and visit so many places in Seoul This is yet another great place to mark on your tour and enjoy your photos for years to come
254,5.0,A well maintained palace in the modern city It is smaller than Gyeongbokgong and Changdeokgung Beautiful scenery
255,4.0,Ive been here a few times over the years and it never disappoints  I love the fact that it has a changing of the guard ceremony 3 times a day I think and other stuff going on too  Once inside though it feels like a different world with a park like ambience plus a mixture of Korean and Western architecture which makes it unique for a Korean palace I like to just sit and watch the world go by here  I walked here but its close to City Hall metro station if youre using the underground
256,4.0,This is a much smaller palace as compared to the grand Gyeongbokgung palace and is in the heart of the city We landed there just in time for the changing of the guards ceremony which is again not as elaborate as the one at Gyeongbokgung but is still nice You can watch the ceremony from the street You need a ticket only to enter the palace grounds The visit does not take much time as the palace grounds are small The guide pointed out to us some of the structures dating back to 1600
257,5.0,A smaller palace in the middle of town Well worth a visit especially if you take the free guided tour about 50 minutes Time your visit to see the changing of the guard which is quite entertaining
258,4.0,Deoksugung is right at City Hall Station I went there to see the City Wall the external wall of Deoksugung This time I went inside the palace as there were lovely maple trees showing beautiful autumn colours Happened to see also the show performed by the palace guards
259,4.0,Deoksugung is the only palace open at night and the way it is all lit up is both beautiful and atmospheric There was a childrens concert going on when we visited which we stopped to listen to
260,4.0,Have to go at the right time to see the changing of the guards in front gates They let you take pictures with them afterwardsIts free and it was really cheap to go into the gardens after if you wanted but we did not go in
261,4.0,I really liked this palace Not as well known as the others but deserves two visits First the afternoon changing of the guards is fun to watch and you can stand right next to the guards Second this palace stays open at night and makes for some great pictures with the lights on the grounds and the surrounding buildings
262,5.0,What a beautiful palace to visit at night We stayed 5 minutes walk from the palace and was reading about the palace being open during the evenings  Definitely highly recommend an evening visit It had a romantic atmosphere and was lovely to visit as a couple  Entrance is 1000 Korean won per person The grounds houses a art museum and some modern art installations are visible on the site Made even more special once lit up As the palace is situated near the city hall and I the heart of the built up city the tall skyscrapers are even more visible at night when they are lit up with their neon lights Spectacular blend of old with the new modern backdrop  Will definitely return during the day It might be the smallest palace of them all but I would definitely recommend a evening visit as you will experience it in a way you cant see the others
263,4.0,But pretty small With the audio guide no need to spend more then an hour Part of the palace pass which contains five palaces Come early to see the changing of the guards but dont enticipate something european
264,4.0,Adjacent City Hall is Deoksugung Temple Grounds which is down the road from the main palace Outside this temple you can find the Royal Guards performing their Change over ceremonies and other cultural displays Once you get inside you will find that this temple ground is larger than it first appears with a CafeGift Shop forested wild pathways council buildings an Art museum temple grounds  buildings and many large art installations If you arrive during the Korean holidays the temple is free entry otherwise you will have to pay to enter There is plenty of exploring to be done in this little area which almost appears hidden from the surrounding city streets like an oasis for people to come and relax or to learn about Art  History or even get a bit of exercise away from the traffic heavy streets of Seoul I highly recommend a visit to this temple even if it is to waste a little time on your journey around the city
265,4.0,Good display of the Changing of the Guard on the outside of the palace gates between 10001400 You dont need a ticket to watch it from the street Lasts about 15 minutes with photo opportunities with the actors after the show is over Worth the trip to see the traditional dress and the parade
266,4.0,1 Closed on Mondays  2 Get the Royal Palace Pass entry to multiple museums  including The Secret Garden; less queuing saving money and all sites are worth a visit  3 The actual review We visited on a Sunday and saw the changing of the guards  narrated in Korean and English Photo opportunities with the guards were free after the ceremony Mix of oldschool Korean buildings and western buildings but all worth a visit Its small but you cant argue with the price Theres a free guide at the entrance and not the one to visit if you only have time for one but can easily be done in a day of other activities
267,5.0,Visited during a day trip it was very cold but the day went well as the Palace is easy to navigate and you can listed to the tour in English as well as have an English tour book
268,5.0,Deoksugung is one of the 5 royal palaces in Seoul It is covered by the Royal Palace Pass but entry is only 1000KW It is a small palace compared to the other main palaces but I think one of the nicer and more interesting The architecture reflects a blend of Korean with western influences
269,5.0,This palace is a lot smaller compared to the others Easily walked through the entire grounds within 30minutes The changing of guards is not to be missed The audio guide can be rented at the entrance
270,4.0,Interesting collection of traditional Korean architecture eg Daehanmun Gate Junghwajeon Hall etc a fusion of Korean and European architecture in Jeonggwanheon Hall then more classical European in Seokjojeon Hall and the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art both fronted by a European garden All overlooked by the high rise buildings of modern Seoul I relatively small complex easy to traverse in 60 or 90 minutes but the architectural contrasts are a highlight Along with the changing of the guard 11am 2pm and 330pm Noisy colorful and informative  really well presented and plenty of photo opportunities at the end
271,4.0,This palace opening hours are 9am to 9pm I visited this palace just before 6pm initially hoping to stay until dark to capture the compound with its lightings However the palace is rather small with only 6 buildings in total As such I spent only an hour here and left not willing to wait till sunset around 8pm  The buildings architecture and design are generally the same as other palaces One unique building is Jeonggwanheon Pavilion built by a Russian architect incorporating Korean and Western designs This pavilion was used for banquets for foreign visitors when they visited the palace
272,2.0,We ventured here for the free rental of Hanbok and the changing of guards performance  Changing of Guards ceremony 11001st Time  14002nd Time  15303rd Time Closed on Mondays  We queued for the Hanbok at 1300 as the sign stated that the counter will be opened at 1330 The counter eventually opened at 1345 with crowds overpowering the queue We voiced out to the crowd and the attending lady in charge Yet the lady in charge replied that she only attends to the people who approached her first regardless of the queue Hence we voiced out to the crowd that there was queue and be sensible to those who have waited for 45mins We were lucky as the crowd were English speakers and they take heed to our comments Beware of the lady attending to you she was rude and abrupt Well we were here for the Hanboks just swallow what her comments were
273,4.0,I went there after being rather unhappy with a museum visit This place saved the day as it was a wonderful way to learn about more recent Korean history and understand how things moved there The mixture of old traditional style Korean architecture with what came to be more fashionable once Korea was influenced by the west is a interesting sight to observe By all means that time to sit and watch observe the landscape Though I did find it annoying that for the museum you needed to buy an extra ticket so I didnt go
274,5.0,A high school student called Esther who is my volunteer guide made the trip perfect She was able to explain about the different buildings meaning of motifs and emblems and story of the Princess Weather is very good in June with sun and nice temperature Just in time to catch the change of guards after my tour Best experience thank you
275,4.0,We didnt go inside the palace but watched the lavish and dramatic changing of the guards at 330 I think the other times are 12 and 2pm but check that if going We get lucky enough to try on free Hanbok costumes to experience the change of the guards and pose with the guards after their ceremony The whole thing lasted about 20 minutes and there were explanations in English The outfits were colourful Theres a huge drum thats beaten too
276,5.0,We went to Deoksugung We were very lucky to be escorted by a volunteer guide He was 16 years old and spoke good English He took us through the various buildings of the palace and gave us a detailed explanation of the uses of the buildings and the history This place was not to big and it was an excellent experience Definitely worth a visit
277,5.0,The changing of the guard ceremony takes place outside of the palace grounds in a small courtyard next to the sidewalk You are very close to all of the participants who are in very colorful costumes Great for photos The park like setting inside the gate is very peaceful Hard to believe it just off a busy street

281,5.0,The ground was not as big as Changdeokgung palace but it was one of our most enjoyable places visited in Seoul mainly because we were given free guided tour and we were also allowed free use of hanbok the traditional South Korean dress After the Royal Guard changing ceremony there was announcement to encourage picture taking with the palace guards which we did while wearing our hanbok  Tip Changing of the guard ceremony is held at 1100 1400 and 1530 closed on Mondays Try to get there at least an hour before the changing of the guard if you want a free guided tour We were there just after 1000am where we saw this youth group who are offering free guided tour At this time the group managing the free hanbok were not yet available We took the tour which was only the tour guide and myself and my wife so it is practically a private tour The guided tour took about 45mins After the tour we went out of the palace and proceeded to the stall of the group that is offering free hanbok We registered and was fitted with hanbok  both my wife and myself We were wearing the hanbok during and after the changing of the guard ceremony and took plenty of pictures of us wearing them  Please note The stall for the free guided tour and the hanbok experiences are NOT inside the palace They are at the left front side of the palace gate
282,5.0,The scheduled Changing of the Guards was cancelled due to fine dust warning issued by the government  But the whole palace itself is a good attraction to visit
283,4.0,This was our first self tour of the Deoksugung Palace Interestingly the entrance fee was waived for the next few days we got lucky We also witnessed a demonstration right outside the palace Lots of Korean and US flags  The palace ground is quite bare and brownish I guess in winter it doesnt look its best What was interesting to do was play a few ancient sports that are on display and we made full use of trying some of the ancient games The palace has an interesting mix of traditional Korean and Colonial style architecture  The law with the fountain area looks really nice and the Museum of Art is quite an interesting albeit boring for kids exhibition  It was a nice day to be out and about as the sun was shining bright on a cold crisp winter day Worth a visit check the box
284,4.0,We went Deoksugung Palace to see the changing guard ceremony at 11am  only 15min  First we went to the hanbok counter to get the free hanbok We can choose the hanbok and we can wear it for photo around the gate for 10min We took many pictures with the free hanbok
285,5.0,It was a strange feeling because it was deoksugung which had come decades ago after the emperor Gojong was abandoned by the pressure of japan in the palace history guidbook he lived here and was called Deoksugung palace the name of the palace is not pleasant However we was doing the gate changing ceremony to remember tttttthe dignity of the palace when the king was inhabited could we go to the royal court as easily as we do now the couple gave free admission togethere as a national merit
286,5.0,Standing in the middle of one of the busiest city junctions a visit to this place can be clubbed with that of City Hall This Palace is considered one among the five grand Palaces of Joseon Dynasty Located near the City Hall Metro station this Palace complex houses a very well maintained garden the National Art Museum influenced by the Western Architecture along with other traditional structures The changing of guard ceremony is also held in this palace which is another major attraction for visitors

288,5.0,I seriously fell in love with the palaces in Seoul This one is definitely definitely recommended to visit The only palace where you can observe the Kings throne closely Even though its pretty small compared to other palaces its still beautiful One of the building isnt painted like other buildings its said that the Emperor Gojong lived there when hes old and passed away at that exact building Theres a mixture between western and eastern architectures here I will come back for sure and maybe will try to book a tour for the Daehan empire history museum  the only building with western influences where Emperor Gojong used to live and entertain guests
289,3.0,Arrived at this palace 15 minutes before the changing guard ceremony What i can suggest please pick a spot facing the gate as usually this side can get a first chance to take a pic with the guards and no crowd yet ; One more thing if you go inside the palace for senior citizen 65yo is free

294,3.0,I liked Deoksugung the least of Seouls five grand palaces Thats because its myriad buildings present a mishmash of neoclassical Western and traditional Korean architectural styles A palace since 1593 Deoksugung took on a new look in the early 1900s when King Gojong instituted a program of modernization and reform In addition during my October visit a wall enclosed a large portion of the grounds further detracting from a cohesive whole Construction work was under way with windows in the wall revealing only dirt and construction materials  I found the buildings interesting to look at separately especially Jeonggwanheon Hall a fusion of Western and Korean The king drank coffee here and entertained guests This small structure features a verandah and metal railings and fits in better with the Korean halls than with the massive Western buildings One of the latter now holds the Daehan Empire History Museum and another features the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art  I came here on a weekday to watch the changing of the guard at the entrance gate and stayed to visit the palace itself The guard ceremony proved to be absolutely spectacular with at least 50 participants dressed as Josenera soldiers and bandsman in vivid yellow or brilliant shades of purple The ceremony lasted about 10 minutes with a woman describing what was happening over a loudspeaker in English and other languages She then invited spectators to approach the soldiers to take photographs  Excellent free brochures about the palace are available in English Information signs most with details in English exist throughout the complex and tours are available in English The admission fee for adults is 1000 KRW about 1 US

299,4.0,This palace and the surrounding grounds are much smaller than the nearby Gyeongbokgung Palace but it is still worth a visit if you have an hour or so to spare We arrived just as the changing of the guard ceremony was starting 11am which takes place just in front of the main gate There wasnt such a big crowd so we had a good view of the ceremony After that we took a walk around the westernstyle garden and the interesting buildings in different architectural styles Part of the site was under renovation but there was still plenty to see including the Modern Art Museum

314,4.0,We were fortunate to arrive just as one of the guard changing events was happening at the gates Very colourful though take the authenticity with a pinch of salt  one of the guards with moustache and pointy beard was definitely a woman Inside it is a delight though not exactly packed We spent an hour there which was sufficient

331,4.0,This is one of my favorite palaces in Seoul I like that the palace is surrounded by modern buildings Its like a little part of history in the city The changing of the guard ceremony is really cool too
332,4.0,Very nice and historical temple Many things to see and nice areas to just walk around in Definitely a must when you visit Seoul
333,4.0,Another majestic palace in the middle of the bustling Seoul These palaces are close to each other and its all worth seeing
334,5.0,The Deoksugung Palace was the home of the king of the Joseon Dynasty and was used as a residence of Emperor Sunjung right up until his death in 1919  The imperial buildings have been restored to their former glory and gardens that are well maintained Guided tours are also available fpr groups or just couples if you book ahead on the Deoksugung website  The grand Western Seokjojeon Hall is architecturally splendid I would have loved to have been able to make it inside had I made a reservation only 5 people are permitted at a scheduled time on a first come first serve basis Through the windows the banquet hall looked like the set of Downton Abbey It makes for utterly gorgeous backdrop for landscape photography  Its highly recommended to watch the Changing of the Guard procession outside the main palace gates at 11am 2pm or 330pm Its a ceremony with lots of drums flag waving marching and military formalities stretching back over hundreds of years Afterwards tourists are welcome to come and take photos with the guards  Finally a great little tip Make sure you check out the Jeongdong Observatory located next door to the palace in the Seoul City Hall Seosonum Annexe Building From the observation deck 18th floor you can capture panoramic views of the Deoksugung palace grounds CBD skyline City Hall grounds and other landmarks  and its Free Youll get some amazing photos as a souvenir
335,5.0,I have visited in the past and enjoy the colorful changing of the guard ceremony Please see my review from 2012 my first visit for exact directions and location of Deoksugung Palace All renovations now completed inside Our visit this time all changing of the guard ceremonies were cancelled because of the hot weather Always be cognizant of the current weather as they may cancel ceremonies if toohot or too cold
336,4.0,A small palace that is open until 9pm and has a stone wall with scenic ginko trees during fall season and a weekend market It is set within walking distance from Myeongdong and has its 330pm changing of the guards that is quite unique and charming They also provide english tours so check its website
337,3.0,On a brief visit to Seoul earlier this year we visited the Deoksugung Palace It is a collection of buildings some dating back to the sixteenth century that have survived wars and some dismantling by the Japanese last century Some of the buildings seem to have been restored while other have the foundations only The grounds were neat and well maintained
338,4.0,Long queues Booking would be recommended We were in the queue for over half an hour and it not protected from the weatherPalace interesting but the highlight is the changing of the guard which is worth watchingThe palace is well maintained and many young Koreans tend to wear national clothing which makes a colourful background
339,4.0,The exchange of guards are extended up to the external side streets of the palace You can also enjoy the view from the top of the building across Deoksugung on weekends  How to get to Deoksugung Palace  Address 99 Sejongdaero Junggu Seoul    99 Direction Get off at City Hall Station Seoul Subway Line 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Exit 2  Seoul Subway Line 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Exit 12 turn left at the exit and walk straight for 30 meters
340,5.0,We managed to secure tickets for the Secret Garden in Deoksugung on our first day in Seoul and all other days for our Seoul trip was sold out While the weather forecast was not good we proceeded on to visit this palace and its garden  Of course it would be a much better visit in gorgeous autumn weather but we managed to enjoy the gardens and the castle complex with its spectacular foliage before the huge downpour Do allow at least half a day in good weather to fully appreciate this complex
341,3.0,The backdrop with leaves etc was dramatic But there really isnt anything to see inside the structures and we could only appreciate from the outside Wish there was more The changing of the guards was a nice bonus
342,4.0,After my 16 hour flight and few hours sleep walking through a new city can be quite daunting but this was the best place I could have ended up the palace and buildings were lovely and there wasnt too many people I was also there for the guards show which was also very entertaining
343,3.0,I plan to go to other palace but our dinner dragged on until 2pm This palace seems to be the only one still open without reservation  The lightning is not good enough so we werent able to truly appreciate the palace but its a unique feeling strolling around the historic place at night
344,4.0,The Changing of the Guards ceremony was quite elaborate and more detailed than that of the larger Gyeongbokgung Palace Unfortunately the viewing area was smaller so it was hard to enjoy all the pageantry drills and musical instruments The grounds of this palace are adjacent to the City Hall so one sees the contrast of the modern and traditional buildings
345,3.0,Unless you cannot visit Gyeongbokgung Palace or Changdeokgung Palace do not bother to visit here as it is a very small palace
346,4.0,Had the opportunity to witness the change of guard Steep in tradition the colours were just beautiful to watch The palace was beautifully built location was super convenient A beautiful experience in Seoul
347,4.0,This palace was very near our hotel and close to City Hall which is one of the most active places on weekends We strolled the grounds which while not as impressive as those at other palaces were pleasant The Changing of the Guards is colorful and impressive and is worth scheduling your time to catch
348,4.0,The regular changing of the guards ceremony is worth seeing with an English language commentary A very convenient location just across the road from Seoul city hall and the city hall itself is worth visiting the basement had an archeological display As for the many temples we visited one tends to forget the specifics of each palace I remember that one of the palace buildings had an organised tour only way to get in but this needs to be booked in advance By the way I was entitled to free entry to many of the palaces and temples due to being over 65 a great deal Worth a visit and easy to get to
349,5.0,We took the subway here and exited at City Hall station It was a smaller palace complex but nice nevertheless We came around lunch time and were fortunate to be able to witness the changing of guards ceremony here It was a very colourful affair Entrance was KRW 1000 which we reckon was cheap As most of the main palaces were near each other you can actually walk from one palace to the other if you dont mind walking
350,4.0,Although I unfortunately missed the changing of the guard it gave me the opportunity to visit this place at night where everything is beautifully lit There was some music and a traditional play was conducted Ununderstandable for me but fascinating nevertheless
351,5.0,It was very surreal for me to be walking along the same paths as many kings in the past The buildings are truly impressive and certainly worth your time A ticket to get in was 1000 won or a little less than a dollar Soooo glad I came here
352,3.0,Nothing special unless you have the time and walk with a guideThis was the last palace we have visited maybe we had enough
353,3.0,This palace is near City Hall and costs W1000 to enter It is closed on Mondays  There are free guided tours in English twice a day at 1030  1330  The palace was the home of two kings the first in the 16th17th centuries and then again in the 19th20th centuries  The best building is the Throne room which has exquisite dragon carvings on the ceiling  Note that the complex houses the Seokjojeon Hall Anybody can visit the basement  not much to see there particularly if you cant read Korean The best parts are the first and second floors But you have to book on the site webpage in advance Or for foreigners there is a special rule to allow up to five to sign up on a waiting list first come first served This hall was built in about 1910 and is a mixture of western and Korean styles The hall is now the Daehan Empire History Museum and is definitely worth a visit The visit is guided and should take about 45 minutes  Time to visit would be up to an hour longer if you go into the hall
354,3.0,This is a place with a very interesting history but they have not made anything of it It is some nice buildings and very little information Thats it
355,5.0,Korea is rich in its history this is just one of the many palaces to visit The recent Goblin drama was flimed outside the walls of this palace too 
356,4.0,Located at the corner of Seouls busiest downtown intersection Deoksugung Palace is famous for its elegant stone wall road It is also the only palace that sits along side a series of western style buildings that add to the uniqueness of the surrounding scenery The Changing of the Guard can be seen in front of Daehanmun Gate and is very popular even for many visitors Closed every Monday Subway Line 1 and 2 City Hall Station Exit 1 2 or 3
357,3.0,This is a smaller palace and area Very pretty if you want a smaller experience than Gyeongbokdung palace
358,5.0,We visited this palace during a bright sunny day Encountered some outdoor traditional Korean entertainment during our visit It was a great experience On the good side of this visit is that the entrance fee is waived for foreigners and we could go back as many times as we wanted We opted to go back a second time during our stay in Seoul because we were with a local friend who couldnt enter one of the buildings without registering online
359,4.0,We visited many similar palaces all over the city where there were hundreds of people rushing about This palace was different because it is smaller less visited and peaceful A great place to visit in the evening Trees were blooming as well Very cheap to enter at KRW 1000
360,4.0,Stayed for a few days in the Plaza hotel which is just in front Deoksugung and was curious to know what is inside  Entrance fee is quite affordable and you get a decent guide for the different buildings however personally I enjoyed much more relaxing under the shadow of the trees just enjoying the view than learn about the history of the place
361,4.0,The palace was not too large in compared with Gyeongbukgung or Changdeokgung but it was easier to find as it was right out City Hall station and opposite the City Hall of Seoul Half of the palace was as traditional as other palaces in Korea but the other half was totally different with Westernstyle building pond fountain and garden that made me very impressed
362,5.0,This place is an absolute must when in Seoul The walk in the park is refreshing and some of the templespalaces are dating back two centuries ago There are also some newer building that have been added in recent times
363,5.0,Deoksugung Palace is a relatively modern royal palace closely associated with King Gojong under oppression by Japanese rulers The palace has classy buildings and ground as well as wooded areas Although this palace is not as popular with foreign tourists as Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung Palace this Deoksugung Palace is well worth a visit especially because it is so conveniently located in the city center across the City Hall acting as a peaceful oasis for relaxation and reflection You can also visit National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in the palace compound The Changing of the Royal Guards take place in front of Daehanmun Gate which is quite colorful and popular ritual for many visitors and passersby Metro stop City Hall Stop for Lines 1  2 as well many bus stops are close to the palace gate
364,4.0,This palace is a definite to see if in the area The compound is relatively small so you would only need to spend an hour or two here Pretty gardens and nice quite spot in the heart of Seoul
365,4.0,This is a relatively small park and I will recommend coming here during the change of guard for photo opportunity  Apart from that it is a nice and relaxing place to take a stroll in the area and view both traditional and modern architecture within a single location
366,3.0,Very convenient to the CBD area and a short walk from some of the major hotels Lacks information and signage to give a feel for how the place looked in its prime and how the place was used Odd collection of buildings of various ages some in traditional style and some in western read brutalist ugly style Worth a visit but 30 minutes probably all you need
367,4.0,Another one of the great Seoul palaces filled with grand colourful structures If you have seen the others and pushed for time you could skip this albeit on a smaller scale However the guided tour was informative and made the visit interesting Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful
368,4.0,Two reasons to visit Deoksugung Palace  its centrally located next to City Hall right in the middle of the city and its less crowded compared to its bigger and more illustrious siblings If you only have 1 hour to spare and would like to experience a Joseon Dynasty palace this is it At only KRW 1000 entrance fees you not only get to experience this but also to witness the Changing of the Palace Guard ceremony at 11 am and explore the beautiful westernstyle architecture of Seokjojeon Hall and its lovely fountain garden
369,3.0,There are many other palaces that are more with to visit I then this one This one is nice but if only you have lots of time to kill in Seoul Otherwise you can skip it It cost 1000 won
370,5.0,It was the first palace we went to and it didnt disappoint We got lucky to go around 11am to witness the changing of the guards ceremony Inside the palace is windy so its relaxing to walk even if its so hot in the afternoon We went there in the 2nd week of June its summer already Not that big compared to Gyeongbokgung
371,4.0,I actually tell visitors to visit Deoksugung instead of Kyeongbokgung many times If you want to see a palace this is a good starter palace to see You will not be walking in wall to wall bodies like at Kyeongbokgung You get way more bang for the won so to speak I was pleasantly surprised by Deoksugung
372,4.0,Not quite as impressive as the forbidden city but nevertheless a nice green spot to visit for about 1
373,4.0,Went to this palace as part of a half day tour Really quaint and pretty Beautiful structures with colorful roofs At 11 am They do a changing of the guards I likes this visit a lot But dont do a tour  read up on it and take your time The grounds are beautiful
374,4.0,We stopped by to see the elaborate changing of the guard ceremony and have a tip View from the street side of the roped square for best pictures without commercial store or kiosks in the background You will also be able to get a better shot of the drummer and get in the square when the ropes are let down for a picture with the colorful guard folk
375,3.0,Nice temple although not the nicest in Seole I loved the arcitecture construction Around all places in the center of the city
376,5.0,Another beautiful palace where we happen to came across a reenactment of a Korean coronation ceremony The grounds are very pretty too
377,5.0,Deoksugung has a different character compared to the other wellknown Korean palaces like Gyeongbukgung or Changdeokgung For me this is mostly because of the mix of Eastern buildings next to Western buildings which are greatly influenced by neoclassical architectural styles Deoksugung is also softer and feels less imposing than Gyeongbukgung possibly due to the less extensive grounds  I visited Deoksugung in the cherry blossom season and it was lovely especially in the sunset and as the lights started to come on Deoksugung is the only palace that is open until 9pm all year round allowing you the opportunity of walking in palace compound at twilight Its pretty amazing to feel that youve been transported back several hundred years only to look up and see a modern building or sign in the distance  If youre not fond of mingling with the tourist crowd but yet wanted to visit a Korean palace Deoksugung is ideal for its size location right next to City Hall and character
378,5.0,We really enjoyed the free one hour drumming performance and were lucky to catch the end of the changing of the guard which happened around 1130
379,3.0,Im not sure why its listed as a separate attraction since its part of the palace one of many buildings in the palace The buildings are replicas and are empty The story we were given is that they are afraid that if they furnish the place the furniture could be used as weapons
380,4.0,Deoksugung palace is one of the five grand palaces built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty This palace is smaller than for instance Changdeokgung Palace or Gyeongbok Palace but really worth a visit Entrance tickets are really cheap and the buildings on the palace grounds are an interesting mixture of Korean and Eastern style buildings The Deoksugung palace is also the only palace which stays open in the evening A visit in the evening is highly recommended because the buildings are beautifully lit If youre a photographer dont forget to bring your tripod
381,5.0,I decided to visit this palace quite last minute and was impressed by the architecture inside it East meets West The change of guard ceremony was a lot more impressive than the one at Gyeongbokgung Palace Dont miss it
382,4.0,Last palace i visit when i in south korea and this palace near from Seoul City Hall you just need cross the street to go to Seoul City Hall
383,4.0,This place is spotlessly clean full of history great palace and grounds Takes a good 2 hours to do this properly Great to see the changing of the guard and they are photo friendly the cherry blossom was out Had a coffee at a nice place inside Well worth the walk
384,3.0,Its not expensive for the ticket and you can walk around enjoy the old Korean style palace It took me just 20 minutes to see them all as well as going to the toilet on the other side of the palace
385,3.0,The Admission 1000 won  The Palace Originally built during the Joseon period one of the historic palace It is situation between modern buildings interesting to see the old and the new in the same place  Beautiful architecture great for photo opportunity There is also a western style garden fountain nice place to sit down relax and enjoy the view  The changing of the royal guard ceremony that takes place every day at the main gate Definitely mustsee You dont need to buy admission ticket to see this because it is right outside the palace  The Subway Station Exit 2 or 12 of City Hall Station Subway Line 1 or 2
386,4.0,This was our first Korean palace experience We enjoyed walking around the grounds We went on a Sunday afternoon and it wasnt very busy I recommend adding this to your itinerary Entrance fee is small and its a great way to spend an hour or two
387,4.0,One of the palace in seoul Located in city hall They have a changing of guard ceremony every day Entrance fee is 1000 krw
388,4.0,I would do Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changdeokgung Palace first If you are then still keen on yet another palace Deoksugung is a good choice Much smaller than the other palaces it is rather more intimate and there are less tourists Also it has not been rebuilt so the atmosphere is more historic than at Gyeongbokgung
389,4.0,This is one of the most interesting Palace I have visited History of it is good but the traditional and modern buildings within Deoksugung is more interesting It shows how South Korea slowly learning from the western culture Interesting place
390,4.0,I stayed in The Plaza Hotel so it is very easy for me to reach this palace The buildings are well preserved and incredibly beautiful exactly like what you see on the dramas or movies Definitely clean and tidy in every corner of the complex Too bad I only spent less than 1 hour in this place I will advice you to spend at least 2 hours in order to really enjoy your moment there It has particular times where you can see the traditional dance performance and palace guards shiftchanging ritual
391,4.0,As I have done most of the palaces this one didnt have anything special no must see factor until I went round the Historical Museum This was the tick in the box for this Palace The w1000 also includes the museum and if you want to walk round head over as soon as you arrive and get yourself on a tour It is access by tour only and they leave every 30 minutes but gets full quick as the groups are only small Shoes off and slippers on they gave me an English audio so I could follow round but obviously the passionate guide was giving the locals much more than I was hearing All renovated in the last 10 years but decorated as best as they could from old photos and with some of the original furniture The history you get is the best thing and even some photos of the old emperors and emperoresses Your 1000 doesnt also get you into the art gallery that will cost you more
392,5.0,Nice collection of palaces both ancient and modern eastern and western Quite small compared to other palaces but well worth visiting as so unique making great photographic juxtapositions If visiting on the weekend go up to Jeonddong Observatory beforehand so as to get a birdseye view in advance
393,5.0,The only opened palace when we were there You can see the difference between the old and new korea when you are in this place
394,5.0,This palace is downtown across from city hall They have a changing of the guard twice a daydont miss it
395,5.0,While this palace doesnt have the sprawling grounds of some of the others  it is stunning The lawns are so wellmanicured and the mixture of the architecture styles is quite interesting to see Some of the more European style buildings were constructed on the palace grounds during the Japanese occupation I believe there is also a small annex of the Seoul City Art Museum inside the grounds which holds small exhibitions I got to see a gorgeous collection of antique Cartier jewelry by chance in there one day Such a fun surprise I would say this palace is a must see
396,4.0,Being the smallest one among the four palaces I got to in Seoul not sure how it compares in size with Gyeonghuigung which is the only one that I didnt get to among Seouls five palaces this is not a palace like Gyeongbokgung which is kind of a world of its own with its huge grounds where youll get an immersion experience of the Joseon era days but what this palace offers just because of its significantly smaller grounds compared to Gyeongbokgung is nice contrasting views of traditional palace buildings  their modern highrise counterparts right outside the confines of the palace grounds including the interestingshaped allglass structure of Seoul City Hall which can be seen from the raised platform around the main palace building which will kind of give you an idea how far Korea has come from those days of the Joseon Dynasty And those relatively small grounds of the Palace actually merge on one side to the left of the main palace building while facing it or equivalently to your right if you go all the way to the end of the pathway from the entrance gate after coming in from the street with the grounds of a big museum with a lovely fountain in front although Im not sure if the museum is considered part of the Palace for admission purposes or if it can be entered from another side  And unlike at the other palaces the main building of this palace can be entered not just to look at from right outside so you can get a closeup view of the throne stage Also present here at the entrance gate are two or three ceremonial guards didnt see them on the way in at about 10 am though only saw them on the way out about an hour later but Im sure theres no big ceremony involving a lot of guardsmen in colorful attires with some holding beautiful flags as at Gyeongbokgung since theres simply no space here for such a ceremony  Coming by subway City Hall Station Lines 1  2 is where to get off and youre pretty much right outside the Palace once you get out of the station onto the big street Sejong Daero just a 1to2minute walk to the entrance gate And what I suggest for the ticket is getting an integrated ticket for 10000 won the equivalent of 10 US dollars which is good for like a month and which gives you admission to four of Seouls five palaces except for Gyeonghuigung which Im sure is a small one maybe even smaller than this one  Jongmyo Shrine; also do keep in mind that this palace along with Changdeokgung  Changgyeonggung are closed on Mondays whereas the main palace Gyeongbokgung  Jongmyo Shrine are closed on Tuesdays
397,4.0,Recommended for families and couples who do not like shopping Great place to learn about korea culture and history while taking in the scenic views
398,5.0,The palace is situated near the City Hall Metro Station with some historical buildings and colourful trees The parade of royal guards is held 3 times per day at the main entrance of the palace We had an enjoyable time visiting this palace
399,4.0,A nice architecture and you can also experience the guard changing ceremony here However there are certain timing of when this ceremony will take place so you will need to do a bit of research went for 11am ceremony To go here take subway to City Hall Line 1 or 2 Exit 2
400,5.0,Subject Deoksugung Location Seoul South Korea Asia Title Deoksugung Palace  a snapshot into South Koreas history ID 443966790  A tour of this palace is a must The English tour guide was knowledgeable enthused and provided an overview in a manner that encouraged questions allowing you to feel the Palace and hear the different spaces For those of us who need to see hear and read the pamphlet available is well written and outlines in details the different Courts and Halls as well as the different time periods and what was taking place With this being my first time to Seoul it was a great introduction  Because it was a group of us we made reservations to be hosted by a English speaking tour guide And yes there is a small entrance fee I hesitate to quote the amount here as who knows when it may change
401,4.0,A very small Palace but the Royal guard changing ceremony is good Its the only Palace that has both Korean and western buildings Same as Gyeongbokgung if u wants to watch the Guard changing ceremony the time will clash with the guided tour so can only choose one
402,4.0,I happened to go on the perfect day I got there right when the changing of the guard was happening happens at 1100am 2pm and 300pm And it was free for everyone that day normal admission is 3000 The National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art Deoksugung is free but you need to make a reservation for the Seokjojeon Hall Neoclassical Western Style Building This place is great to see the difference between modern and old but youll be done in an hour maximum Go to City Hall Station Exit 2 from Line 1 or Exit 12 from Line 2
403,4.0,Came to visit Deoksugung Palace as well as to witness the changing of guards ceremony which was done thrice a day at 11am 2pm and 330pm Entrance ticket is attractively priced at 1k for adult and 500 for child  The changing of guards ceremony is very spectacular However there is only Korean and Chinese narration provided during the ceremony thus may have to read up the before the visit to fully appreciate  Overall a good way to immerse the Korean history after days of city shopping
404,4.0,This Palace is across the street from City Hall It is not as large as the other palaces but has the Changing of the Guard Ceremony which is very interesting and if you make special reservations you can tour the European buildings from the early 1900s which is unique here Only 1000 won 1 to enterso worth it
405,5.0,Im grateful that I visited this place during the spring season and witness the cherry blossom trees It is also nice to watch the Royal GuardChanging Ceremony in this palace
406,4.0,Seoul has many of them this one is right next to the city hall fee is less then a 1 euro and you get a free 40 minute english guided tour very nice With guide is better they has as well the change of the guard which is interesting Inside is as well a museam which has a extra charge if you want to go Worthwhile to visit if you have time and the weather is nice
407,5.0,Staying right next door The Plaza I have no excuse not to visit this palace In fact it is the first palace I visited in Seoul I deliberately waited to write this after visiting others To me this is the most quaint It was the last day of autumn  I joined the morning English tour which was very informative Especially on the Joeson Empire  Then I wandered into this part of the garden which took my breath away the glorious colours of autumn  I bought the Royal Museum Pass The MMCA in this palace requires a separate entrance charge
408,5.0,Nice place full of autumn Colours 1000 won for a good walk in the palace Not as big as the Gyeongbukgong palace so the walk is not as tiring
409,4.0,We visited this beautiful place by night on our way back to our hotel It has a palace with a central court a bell building and a fountain It is one of those that has been destroyed during the Japanese colonization and currently only a third of the original building is left but what is left is worth seeing
410,4.0,OK I admit it  I was a lucky one But first some background Outside the main gate at certain times youll have to look up they have a stand for individuals to dress in traditional outfits and take photos This is timed to coincide with the changing of the guard ceremonies replicating the traditional method of days gone by They select a tourist to participate Being selected made the visit inside even more magnetic Its not huge inside but it shows some history including some modern aspects If you like history sign up for the Seokjojeon Hall in advance on webpage Its newer but fancy If your time in Seoul is limited youd probably want to skip the palace tour
411,5.0,The palace is located right in the heart of Seoul It is a nice respite from the busy urban area Be sure and attend one of the Changing of the Guard ceremonies
412,5.0,The living quarters of Koreas first and last but one emperor who enjoyed coffee Its a charming place to visit even if youre not interested in the history If you love taking photos its a wonderful location The trees are beautiful and so many interesting details inside and outside the buildings  Honestly Im not interested in modern history 20th century but I suggest you go with someone whos wellversed in the life of King Gojong Its a very human story worth listening to  Occasionally even on weekdays theres a ceremony of changing the guards in front of the palace Catch it if you can
413,5.0,Got some lovely photos of this palace The buildings are beautiful and the grounds are lovely to stroll around We spotted a couple taking their wedding photos in traditional garments Its free to enter if you dress in traditional clothes too
414,4.0,Its strongly recommended to buy combined ticket for all the palaces 5  10 000 W and try the guided tour Its free all guides speak fluent english and explain all that you can see Palace seems similar to other ones so Its really useful to have a guided tour which explain all the differences and show you what makes this one really different from the other 4
415,5.0,Deoksugung palace is smaller than other palaces But it attracted me more cause I could enjoy it with less people there I was there when theres a ceremonial not the guards changinghappened It took place in front of the palace gate and they even had a parade on the street No need to buy ticket at that time I was so lucky I could enter the palace for free By the time I finished going around the parade just returned back so I could take more photos The location is close to city hall
416,3.0,A visit to this palace gives the visitors a quick taste of the old times Korea of what it would have been This palace comes complete with a regular show of the changing of the guards out the front about three times a day The guards are part of the show rather than actual guards protecting the palace There are quite a few ancient buildings which have been reconstructed along with fountain  statues around the peaceful ground  Tip We spent an hour wandering the ground to pass time but a good tip would be to save some time to try on the free Traditional Korean costume dress up right outside the front for some photo opportunity We found out too late that this great tourist experience was just outsider and complimentary when our tour bus arrived for the pick up
417,3.0,The palace itself is not very impressive but the change of the guard is something It takes place outside the gate Well worth to see Nearby are other attractions like Seoul City Hall and the end of the Cheonggyecheon stream Not far from the Gyeongbokgung palace
418,4.0,I choose to see the changing guard ceremony in smaller palace because less people than in bigger palace like Gyeongbokgung palace and its more comfortable for me since travelling with a baby It was more than I expected The ceremony was great I can watch whole ceremony without difficulty because I am not that tall They asked foreigner to hit the gong and asked them to wear hanbok during the ceremony They were also hanbok free to wear near the ceremony area You can wear them for free But not all tourist is permitted they see how tall you are so their hanbok is not being walked on hanbok
419,5.0,This palace has a show of costumed Korean guards in front of the gate Fun Entering the gate is only a couple dollars Inside is a very interesting and characteristic collection of ancient buildings reconstructed statues an arbor and a fountain Walking on the grounds is peaceful with pathways through the trees Finally for extra admission there is an art museum at the far side with very good exhibitions which change regularly Modern traditional western and Korean art are displayed in various large scale shows throughout the year in this awesome space
420,4.0,Besides the palace you can also visit its garden fountain and modern homes The changing of the royal guards is a mustsee
421,4.0,Different to other palaces  many different styleage buildings and the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary art is up the back The grounds themselves are beautiful well worth an afternoon stroll and rest from the hectic pace of the city
422,4.0,Deoksugung was strikingly more modernized with foreign embassies It also has a guard changing ceremony 3 times a day Its close distance to city hall makes it easy to drop by to visit I had the combination ticket to all 4 palaces so I came by to visit this one as well There are 2 English tours per day Check the website for timing
423,5.0,to combine history and modern art in a short excursion within the centre of Seoul  palace buildings quaint park and a branch of the MMCA
424,5.0,We didnt end up visiting inside the Palace as we arrived in time for the 2pm changing of the guard ceremony and discovered it was actually done out of the street Very colourful with pomp  ceremony The drummer was a highlight such a powerful swing At the completion of the ceremony the public were invited to take photos with any of the ceremony participants Fantastic  free Thank you Seoul
425,5.0,A wonderful place to just wander around and feel relaxed Was very well priced less than the price of the subway So its definitely the place to go where lots of local children are also exploring their culture and history  My husband and I were here mid morning just missed the free English tour but thats ok You can feel the history inside the walled residences  Also hang out for the procession its pretty spectacular
426,4.0,The Deoksugung Palace is conveniently located next to the City Hall subway station It is not a big as the other palaces like Changdeokgung or Gyeongbokgung palaces but is unique as it has 2 western styles buildings inside which was the residence of the royal family for a while There is a tour of this residence which is interesting The changing of the guards is definitely the highlight of the palace From there I walked down to Sungnyemun Gate and Namdaemun Market
427,3.0,We understand that this is the only royal palace which can be visited at night illuminated OK we saw it by daylight Japanese invaders did a fairly thorough destruction job and we could not visit the Westernstyle building as it takes only groups of 5 people at a time on a first come first served basis \xe2\x80\x93 and we were 7 and 8 As Seoul royal palaces go this one is certainly not a must but the very colorful procession of the changing of the guard three times a day 11 am 2 pm and 330 pm is certainly worth the sight The procession crosses the premises from the Westernstyle palace and heads for Daehanmun Gate close to City Hall where they perform some martial movements rhythmed by drum beats \xe2\x80\x93 a popular photo op the more so that visitors are invited to join the guards for pics at the end of the show

435,4.0,I kinda like visiting those palaces and stuff whenever I am travelling I have to say that although this might not be one of the best but still it was worth a visit  They had this changing guard ceremony everyday at 11am if I was not mistaken Probably you should not miss it as it might be the highlight of the place  But to keep those traditional palace surrounded by tall buildings and in the heart of the city was amazing
436,3.0,As with all the Seoul palaces this place is majestic and peaceful The only issue with this one compared to the others is that most of the information signs were only in Korean and this turned us off going to other museums
437,4.0,You can try on hanbok and take photos around 15 minutes for free However they have the timetable so be sure to check first
438,5.0,While not as large as Gyeongbokgung Changdeokgung or Changgyeonggung Palace Deoksugung Palace is the serene and beautifullycanopied seat of Koreas brief imperial power As it was originally constructed as a residence not designated for royalty Deoksugung possesses a humble quality enhanced by the beautiful foliage landscaping the premises It is historically significant as the only imperial palace and the place where Emperor Gojong died in 1919 It is a beautiful mix of eastern and western architecture a testament to Gojongs desire to lead Korea onto the world stage in the early 20th century The thricedaily changingoftheguard ceremony transports visitors back to the Joseon dynasty and is a mustsee if visiting this palace Admission is inexpensive and guided tours are free Our English tour guide was charming polite and wellversed to answer questions
439,5.0,Very close to city hall this palace is very peaceful We had a free tour which explained a lot and the changing of the guard ceremony was very colourful and interesting
440,5.0,I didnt expect much from this palace its small a third of its original size and gives an impression of a lessthankorean palace sibce there are modern buildings in it BUT It has difinitely exceeded my expectation Firstly it was considerably less crowded than Gyeongbukgung even in its peak time which is 11 am when the Changing of the Guard takes place Secondly the Changing of the guard is a wonderful experience you can follow the marching band around and watch the change comfortably and then even pause a few times to let you take photos with the guards Thirdly the history of the different buildings that compile the palace is very interesting One of the buildings is a fusion between traditional korean architecture and imperial architecture and to my opinion it was spectacular  For the meek price of 1000 won I recommend going I arrived around 920am so I even managed to get a free english tour with a guide before following the marching band  Overall I spent 3 hours exploring including the guard change and half a guided tour
441,4.0,Spent a very charming hour walking around the palace looking at the buildings and soaking up the history Its surprising quiet when you think it is just across from City Hall and has some lovely gardens to walk around in Great to pop into as it is not a big palace the smallest of the 5 in Seoul and has some interesting recent history  the site of the joint Soviet  American commission in 1946 where the USA tried to get the Soviets to accept a unified democratic Korea
442,4.0,After a long day and on my way to an evening flea market and some dinner I passed this nice little palace Open until 2100 hours and well lit it was little gem for a very little price
443,5.0,It is smaller now than the other palaces but relatively uncrowded so you can explore easily Great free English speaking guide and if you go to the main residence you may be able as a foreigner to book a time for entry It is worth it and the free English audio is excellent Not as grand as the Gyeongbokgung palace but rather restful If you had time Id do this first as the explained features are the same and the history of the murder of the Emperors wife takes on meaning
444,5.0,I love the grandiose Royal Changing of Guards here If I were you go at the entrance if they will be having the said ceremony See it up close and take a picture with the guards
445,5.0,What a deal People over the age of 65 gets in free Located right in the middle of the city Besides access to the spacious grounds there is a walking tour of the Edwardian style Palace Unfortunately it is conducted in Korean but one can rent the audio tour It is very comprehensive and takes over 75 minutes so be warned
446,4.0,The palace complex comprises of many buildings halls It is so close to the City Hall subway station The entrance fee is only KW1000 very minimal isnt it The place is like a mini park and it would be nice to just sit down and relax there The guards look interesting with their traditional dress Ask the information center about the time for change of guard Its unique and worth waiting for
447,5.0,Located in the middle of several touristic spots This palace gives you the opportunity of scape of the big city and see some beautiful buildings The entrance is very cheap Around 1 US dollar Theres the change of guard constantly going on And its a great opportunity to have a bit of the spirit of old Korea and take pictures with those characters Theres free wifi inside and its not allowed to smoke
448,5.0,The entrance to the Palace grounds is a canopy of cherry blossoms Allow at least an hour to visit the many buildings There is a separate art museum which charges an entrance fee We got to see the paintings of a Korean artist which were stunning There was a concert of popular Korean music given on the grass in front of the museum There is the possibility of visiting the Palace rooms This takes a special ticket for which the concierge at our hotel arranged It may be possible to arrange this per Internet There is no additional charge to visit the Palace but a reservation is essential
449,5.0,I had a nice stroll in this beautiful place Sat on one of the bench and idle with nice views of the surrounding and architecture Many walks of life visits this place  I noticed many school children in uniform here Elderly with their grand kids walk hand in hand enjoying the surrounding and time together At interval times there is The Changing of the Royal Guard is in front of Daehanmun Gate which lasts about 1hour A well preserve piece of history in a modern city  Consists of traditional palace buildings landscaped and forested gardens a statue of King Sejong the Great and the National Museum of Art which holds special exhibitionsLocated near City Hall Station
450,5.0,There is a great changing of the guards ceremony at around 11 AM it is absolutely worth it The palace grounds are beautiful with many nice areas to take pictures especially in the gardens Surrounded by skyscrapers its definitely a nice natural and historical haven right in the middle of the city
451,4.0,You cant help but notice when visiting this ancient Palace that you are surrounded by modern day high rises in the heart of the city  This was a very popular Palace for school children to visit as there had to be several hundred children on site  The grounds are very nice and much bigger than expected There is a mixture of Western and Korean architecture Make sure to grab the brochure expaling everything at the entrance way  Definitely worth a look Very cheap to get in only 1000 won but free if you are 65 or older

455,5.0,Webhad several hours to spend in seul and this place was great place to visit Spent there more than an hour It cost around 1 to enter and u get instructions in several languages If you have few hours free in the city this place can be very nice visit for you
456,4.0,I have been to Seoul in November 2015 in good weather although its cloudy and some time rainy however very enjoyable if you have fear to get wet by rain bring an umbrella with you  This Ancient Palace is located in Seoul city surrounded by the modern urban infrastructure it is near to the City Hall Station Subway The palace belong to the Joseon Dynasty You will feel very nice after entering inside most of the area is surrounded by the plantation and in Autumn seasons different shades of maples pleasing the viewers the nature lovers will definitely love this place  In a very big compound there are different types of building of 15th  16th century people who like to visit historical places  attraction this place is definitely worth to visit for close attention and details you should have sufficient time considering the opening and closing of the palace There is museum inside basement 1st and 2nd floor and to visit the place prior reservation is required via Deoksugung homepage
457,4.0,A nice example of the palaces but time your visit to watch the changing of the guard It is very colorful and adds to the ancient feel of the palace One of the buildings house the National Museum of Contemporary Art Worth a couple of hours
458,5.0,This Palace one of four major Palaces in the same vicinity in Seoul is pretty much directly opposite City Hall and theres a metro station at City Hall so its easy to get to and find This is a smaller Palace than some of the others and has a few more laterbuilt buildings so is quite distinct from the other Palaces The Palace guards are interesting to see and photograph and you dont have to buy a ticket to go into the Palace to see them as for obvious reasons they are on the outside of the gate They are used to having their photos taken As a consequence you can also see much of the changing of the guards from the street too free of charge much like Buckingham Palace And the changing of the guards at Deoksugung and at Gyeongbokgung not far up the road for that matter has just as much pomp and ceremony with colourful uniforms and a marching band as Buckingham Palace or Horseguards Well worth a look if you can time it right
459,5.0,We watched the full changing guard ceremony and got the chance to wear Korean hanbok free for tourist before entering the gate theres a booth on the right that provides Korean traditional clothes for tourist to wear just need to fill out your name and took a photo with the head of guards The booth closed around 2 or 3 pm Very memorable
460,4.0,I was glad to see this palace just wish it was in the day not night time even though the lighting was kind of nice at night
461,5.0,There are other main palaces that are closer to each other and make it easier for people to do palace tours at the same day and Deoksugung is often left out because it is a little far and in different direction But its right across Seoul city hall and very easy to find It has nice parks and very unique because it has museums within it too During weekends and holidays I think there are highschool student volunteers doing English guide I went in August 15th the Korean Independence Day and they opened for free There will be some other national holidays when they open for free so check it out before the visit
462,4.0,We stumbled on this palace on our way from Namsan Park to Gyeongbukgong Palace It costs about 2 USD to enter the palace and it is certainly worth it Spend about half an hour wandering the beautiful grounds
463,4.0,Easy to reach by metro Buy a combination ticket for all the palaces and jongmyo for 10000 KRW Ther is a small empire museum in the basement the larger palace museum is only open for guided tours The changing of the guard is a nice show to see Most of the action takes place outside the Palace ground in front of the main entrance so better try to be outside than inside to see the ceremony
464,4.0,Unfortunately we missed the changing of the guard but its a beautiful palace for sure Definitely worth going to even in the dead of winter I recommend it
465,5.0,The palace complex is a wonderful place to roam around The main throne room has a decorated ceiling that is really intricate detailed and colourful Many other buildings also add to the understanding of how court life must have functioned To see all of the buildings be prepared to spend the whole day
466,5.0,Exclusive and free experience that you can watch in front of the palaces gate Just curious that some performer are westerner dressing in an old traditional Korean guard uniform I found it a bit strange
467,4.0,I was there after visiting the Art Museum and I watched the changing of the guards at 11 am It was quite an experience with all the marching and drums performance
468,5.0,As it was quite near our hotel this was first We chanced upon a Changing of the Guards ceremony and it was quite interesting and the colors were fascinating We toured during the MERS scare and there were not a lot of tourists around Our photos were quite nice as it appeared like we were the only ones around its a small palace and its something you can quickly finish up in an hour or two
469,4.0,This palace is an ocean of serenity in the middle of a very busy part of Seoul and while the palace deserve a visit as it is the change of guards is a fantastic sight to see great and a fantastic recreation of Korean history
470,5.0,Stayed about 2 hours which about tested the limits of a 3yo Nice microcosm to see what a Korean palace is like without having to travel too far and having to feel obliged to walk the extensive grounds of a bigger palace like changdeokgung
471,4.0,We choose to visit Deoksugung because of its size We would like to be able to tour the ground and thought that Gyeongbok and Changdeok is too much for our group of elderly and small children to walk through and cover all  We arrive exactly as the changing of the guard ceremony is about to start at 11 am and lucky enough to find a booth in front of the main gate that offer services of young korean student for a free tour to tourist They were official and looked very professional with their orange uniform and obviously they get the support from the local govt The purpose is to practise their english with foreigners and to learn more of their own culture which I thought were very nice  Sara our guide was only 14 years old about the same age as my eldest daughter thus they were instantly having a girl talk  she showed us around the palace complex stopped every now and then to explain about the buildings and their history  The complex also has a museum but we choose not to go in so cant comment on that one
472,3.0,The guard changing was interesting tradition passed down though generations guards in traditional clothings martial art demostration Theres a carpenter outside the wall Need to buy tickets to enter premise More of preserved architectures for photography Not for wet weather
473,5.0,I recommend everyone to see the guard changing ceremony It is pretty fascinating They are actors but it is nice to see the tradition is still preserved There was yellow booth set up beside the entrance so you can try hanbok or traditional Korean clothes for free and get to take pictures with the guide while wearing it I recommend to get the free volunteer guide before you get in Ours was a high schooler with excellent English and he gave a lot of good explanation and insight of the palaces and Korean culture I love how the public restroom was warm and has heated water Got to escape the coldness outdoor for a little bit
474,4.0,located near the city hall good to walk around and see korean palace Convenient access but nothing much to do there
475,5.0,One of the Five Grand Palaces of Joseon Dynasty\xe2\x80\x9d is easy to access as it is located in the city centre in front of Seoul Plaza and City Hall  I really recommend to check out official information about time of changing guard ceremonies we saw one at 1400 and it was the biggest performance  took around 30 mina  with also music show and martial art show They are WORTH watching Tourists are also encouraged to take photos with the guards   For palace itself it is a big complex with both Western and Asian architecture Additional Westernstyle buildings were added during Korean modernization period in XIXXX century  Highly recommend to visit this palace
476,5.0,I never dreamed there were so many beautiful palaces in Korea This palace seemed smaller than Gyeongbokgung but equally as impressive
477,5.0,I got to witness the change of Guards and a terrific lady from HighSchool  who was volunteering to Guide Tourist around for free the entrence fees are nothing dont forget to bring your Hat and it takes more than one hour all rebuild after the fire  you need to learn about History there for sure
478,3.0,This palace is within walking distance from the City Hall Station Had I not visited Gyeongbokgung the next day I would have rated it very good Somehow the modern cityscape surrounding the palace ground spoils the flavor of the traditional palace architectures  The Royal Guards changing ceremony is a must watch if you do not plan to go to Gyeongbokgung Do check out the schedule in advance so that you can optimize your time Be at the entrance before time so that you can watch from a good spot The schedules during our visit in the last week of Oct15 were 11 am 2 pm and 330 pm The ceremony last for 30 minutes and I found it a bit lengthy at the end The colourful costumes of the Royal Guards make some of the otherwise plain photos stand out  It is also worth to pay a visit to the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art which is also inside the palace compound If youre here at the right time during autumn which we obviously were not you should be able to see a blaze of vibrant autumn colours
479,3.0,Should come if you are into history and stuff Im not one myself so just stepped by for landscape but it is nice
480,4.0,It might not be the most impressive of the palaces in Seoul but its still worth a visit and entry really doesnt cost much at all You probably dont need to spend much more than an hour there and definitely not more than two but the architecture alone is worth the price of admission even without taking into consideration the historical importance of the palace Signs are in English Korean Japanese and Chinese so almost any visitor can learn about the historical details
481,3.0,It was a very cold day  0 degrees so my walk around the grounds was brisk The entry fee is only 1000 won about 150 AUD so inexpensive  There are free tours leaving twice a day and there are brochures just inside the gates in English There are a number of plaques dotted about that have a short paragraph in English explaining the relevance which is very useful Overall it is a peaceful place that was largely empty in December and is was easy to stroll around and look at the gardens although they are pretty bare in winter  The grounds also house the Daehan Empire History museum which has tours of the 1st and second floors of the palace I peeked through the windows was worth a look if you like palaces and you can reserve your place in the free queue almost every hour  I didnt know this before I went so the tours were full Check it out before you go the rooms looked lovely In the ground level was a museum about the history of the dynasty Im not really sure there was an english brochure which didnt explain much and none of the displays had english translations so I am not sure what it was about Give it a miss if you are in a hurry although it is nice to get in outside from the cold  The changing of the guard was at 11am and I was able to see them marching from behind the hall all the way through the gardens to the outside gate Ignore the cheapskates who say to not pay go in and see it It was a good spectacle  Allow about an hour and there are plenty of toilets and drinking fountains throughout as well as a few vending machines if you want a quick drink or snack
482,3.0,My family visited the Deoksugung Palace after lunch at the Grilled Fish Street  The palace provided a glimpse into how the royalty lived  a feel of their architecture their residence ondolstyle sleeping quarters garden  and a little of their history  We arrived just before 2pm and managed to catch the changing of royal guard at the palaceto be more precise an reenactment  It added to the experience  On the whole the visit was educational but not inspiringa single visit will do
483,3.0,Not really that impressive Can cover the palace ground in less than an hour However the changing of the guard is quite interesting It can be viewed at the entrance of the palace and hence not necessary to pay the 1000 won fee Its done 3 time a day
484,4.0,Deoksugung is a nice palace that is surrounded by tall buildings and a bustling city This place is a quick walkthrough compared to other palaces in Seoul but its worth a visit if you have been to the other palaces
485,4.0,A bit smaller than Gyeongbukgung but still beautiful Perfect for those who want to see the historical era of Korean Kingdom but have limited time During autumn the palace garden looked very beautiful The changing of royal guard ceremony is also very interesting to watch
486,4.0,this is the place that u see what a gorgeous colourful tree what colour u wanna see u will see u will enjoy with step u walk through
487,4.0,We visited Deoksugang Palace on a recent visit to Seoul It makes a great stop if you have a limited amount of time to visit one of the four main palaces in Seoul It gives you a taste of what the palaces were like back in the time of the Joseon Dynasty This palace complex is compact all the sites are within easy walking distance of each other and the signs are in English as well as Korean It is easy to get to either by subway or via the Hop on Hop off city bus tour of Seoul Consider a visit here if your time in Seoul or interest in Korean palaces is limited It is worth a halfhour to an hour of your time
488,4.0,it was great walking along the stone wall side of deoksugung palace is beautifull  especially when autumn It is a famous destination for the domestic and foreign tourist
489,4.0,Deoksugung 1000 for adults is one of the Five Grand Palaces of the Joseon Dynasty located next to Seoul Plaza and City Hall in the city centre Opening hours are 9am to 9pm closed Mondays  This palace served as the residence of the Royal family twice during late 16th century and then again at the turn of the 20th century providing well preserved buildings of traditional Korean and Western architecture  Here you will find a collection of traditional Korean style entrance gates lovely inner courtyards worship and residential halls pavilions and landscaping all quite similar to what you see at the much larger Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces You can also watch Changing of the Guards ceremonies here at Daehanmun Gate  Two unique inclusions at Deoksugung include the Western style buildings at Seogeodong Hall which was built in European style in 1910 and the adjacent building used to house the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art MMCA  Deoksugung branch  One of the things we very much enjoyed about visiting Deoksugung during the autumn was the fantastic fall foliage display seen throughout the palace grounds There were numerous spots where we found multiple colours of tree leaves that made for lovely photographs The autumn scene here was considerably more impressive here than at other palace grounds visited during this trip to Seoul  We were however disappointed to find the MMCA Deoksugung Art Museum closed during the time of our visit There was no indicated closing on the MMCA or Deoksugung websites nor at the place entrance which was odd  Overall we quite enjoyed spending time at the Deoksugung Palace Not only was it exceptionally beautiful this time of year but we found it more management a place to visit compared to larger palace grounds around Seoul You can comfortably browse Deoksugung in 3045 minutes or longer if you want to visit more leisurely This is a very good and cheap attraction visit to consider making during trips to Seoul
490,5.0,Beautiful place and interesting ceremony of changing of the guards sad to say I could not really understand the English accent of the commentator who would switch from Chinese to English But these are quiet and picturesque grounds in the middle of a busy city Had a lovely time walking around with my husband and enjoying a quieter part of Seoul Went to the Museum also located inside the grounds Free to enter  Go to City Hall station Exit 2
491,4.0,Went there around 4pm and just managed to catch the royal guard changing ceremony Entered the park too to snap good photos of autumn The view is stunning
492,5.0,Try to catch the changing of the guard ceremony but also do pay the 1000 Won to enter and take a walk around Its a gorgeous place to take some pictures and feels like a sanctuary in the middle of Seoul
493,4.0,Simply beautiful lots of color great place to take pictures I love my family and we had a wonderful time learning about Korean history\xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xb0\xe2\x80\xa2
494,4.0,Take a stroll near the wall to see the beautiful Ginko tree line Just dont step on its fruit or youll smell like dog poop forever
495,4.0,We did not pay the entrance fee to enter the palace We came to witness the guardchanging ceremony which take place three times a day 1100  1400  1530 in front of Daehanmun Gate It is easy to get here by subway either Exit 1 or 3 of City Hall station We came earlier and took a stroll along the stone way path beside the external wall of the palace which is very picturesque especially in autumn The guard changing ceremony is quite interesting and they even allow us time to take pictures with the guards after the ceremony
496,4.0,The entrance fee is cheap and the palace isnt that big so be sure to stop by even you have little time because its worth it Though its small but its beautifully compact Be sure to walk along the path on the outer part of the gate because the road is one not to be missed for its beauty in all season
497,4.0,not wearing the hanbok yet i still feel like a princess taking a stroll around the castle listening to the birds  enjoying the weather
498,4.0,This looked like one of the smaller palaces but it provides a lovely glimpse of old traditional historical palaces looked like We went on a quiet day so didnt get swamped by crowds
499,4.0,This is a nice place but there are Bigger palaces in the city 1000 won very reasonable admission Nice to take a stroll down to Myeung Dong area from here
500,5.0,If your plan includes Namdaemun Market then it is very likely that youll walk past this palace Therefore Ill highly recommend you pay a visit to this famous landmark and soak in the ancient context behind Korean royalty many centuries ago  The most unique section in this palace is the attached Western neoclassical European styled buildings This is a stark contrast on the conventional and traditional Chinesestyled palace facade
501,4.0,This is also known as Gyeongungung Palace Its one of the 5grand palaces built by the kings It has garden forested around and also has a square with the statue of King Sejong the Great
502,5.0,This palace is a quick walk from my hotel so had to visit en route to Namdaemun market Beautiful grounds
503,5.0,This is the palace I visited other than Changdeokgung It was not as big as Changdeokgung or Gyeongbokgung But inside there is a combination of old palace and modernlooking palace plus a modern contemporary art museum  At the beginning you can watch changing of guards And that day Friday October 9th 2015 at around 121 pm there is a traditional modern fusion music show MUST WATCH Im not sure if its held everydaynot
504,3.0,At the time of my visit the main hall was completely under wraps for renovation That said you may find \xe2\x80\x93 as I did \xe2\x80\x93 that this compound offers more of a cool leafy break from frantic downtown Seoul than a serious competitor to the other of Seouls palaces  It has very much of a parklike layout that seems to encourage relaxing and strolling The two main structures at the time I was there were the completely incongruous neo classical Museum of Modern Art and Royal Museum buildings \xe2\x80\x93 two structures which look like theyd be more at home in Washington DC than in Seoul  The entrance fee is very modest I believe 1000 Won so it is not a great financial investment to check it out particularly in the middle of a hot day I dont know if it is worth a special trip but if you have other sights nearby lined up then its logical to stop in
505,4.0,This is included if you get the combination Palace pass It is near City Hall It is very much like the other Palaces but very nice On reflection I would not get the combination pass as in my opinion you do not need to see them all as they are much the same
506,3.0,My parents and I visited this medium sized palace on a sunny day and we saw the changing of the guards parade which was quite interesting although it gets draggy after a while You can take photos with the guards at the entrance and if you have children the guard will pose for you as well unlike the stiff royal guards at the Tower of London This place is for you if you enjoy photography of architecture and outdoors There is a cafe and resting areas within the compound but there are lots more eateries including Dunkin Donuts just outside the entrance you can find a seat there facing the entrance and when the changing of guards ceremony starts you can enjoy the whole ritual while you munch your donuts but chances are the tourists will block your view There is a contemporary art museum located within the compound and also another historical building inside but I found the former a little boring and the latter only allows guided tours at specific hours which you need to book in advance because of restrictions in group size
507,4.0,Interesting place to visitVery traditional and cultural Accessible from main street and close to amneties
508,5.0,We watched the changing of the guards The walk along the tree lined path was lovely along the way to see all the cravings on the buildings  At the end was a pond and and the 2 huge buildings were amazing  One holds works of arts the other was a home but we could not get in as you have to make a appointment to see all inside or as a tour  The ground s are beautiful and peaceful away from the traffic of the city
509,4.0,More compact than other palace sites and has one modern palace on site If you are short on time this should be your one palace visit
510,5.0,This is my favourite palace of Seoul Its not to crowded and the mixture of western and korean architecture is simply awesome Entrance fee is very reasonable 1000 for adults
511,4.0,It was interesting to see this traditional palace sitting among all the sky scrappers Hopefully youll have a tour guide that can give you some of the history about the place
512,3.0,Deoksu Palace served as the kings residence twice during Josecon The site was originally the home of Prince Wolsan and King Seonjo lived here temporarily after returning to the capital following the withdrawal of Japanese forces in 1593
513,3.0,Smaller than Geongbukkung not sure I spelled it right It has its charm but the great palace is better
514,4.0,As my aged parents couldnt walk alot so we chose this palace to visit We went there to watch the guardchanging ceremony It was interesting  we enjoyed the short martial art performance too After that we went in  take a slow stroll around It was quiet  not so many tourists We sat down to eat icecream  drink coffee at a outdoor snack kiosk It was very relaxing
515,3.0,if I compare Deoksugung to the other palaces Deoksugung is quiet and peaceful but the scale and size is small so its not that dynamic and exciting
516,5.0,Unexpected quiet and serene palace beside a main 10 lane road The serenity was so relaxing The palace building were impressive However the best thing was the changing of the guard ceremony at 11am I did not know about it so was surprised when nearly run over by the parade Got a really good view and the ceremony had many parts Took about 25 minutes and was followed by a martial arts display There were a lot less tourists here so much more enjoyable
517,3.0,Most of the Korean palaces are restored This does not take from giving you the view of how they would have appeared during the period as the Koreans have painstakingly reconstructed the buildings using the techniques and styles of the time But they do tend to all look the same once you have view more than two I would recommend you to visit one that appeals to you and spend some time viewing that one and they have the rest of your time in Seoul visiting other interesting places
518,5.0,My aunt and I came upon this little place by accident we were actually trying to catch the metro for another palace The interesting thing about this palace is that its remains lie across the street from Seoul City Hall where there is always a concert or market or something going on When you walk in the palace itself is just beyond the trees and paths of greenery The designs of the palace itself are those that one sees in all the palaces flowers with bright colors and repetition of all the designs As you walk further into the area you come across a museum of art which is separated from the palace by a little pond with a fountain The hustle and bustle of the street and city beyond the palace walls all but disappears Its crazy to have the two contrasts of old meets new in this small area
519,5.0,The perfect time to visit is during the week in the morning right after the palace has opened Thats the perfect time for pictures without crowds of people This palace is beautiful and shouldnt be missed I suggest taking a guided tour and attempting to catch the changing of the guard ceremony
520,4.0,Deoksugung is one of the most beautiful palace of Joseon Dynasty It is really famous for its own beauty There are a lot of delicious restaurants around Deoksugung If you wear Korean Traditional clothes you can get free admission
521,4.0,Gyeongbokgung Kyongbok may be the largest Joseon Choson dynasty palace in Seoul but Deoksugung Daekso Duksoo is perhaps the most charming The central palace itself is small and empty except for the throne in the middle of the throne room but the details on the roof are exquisite The small side buildings are also worth investigating including the bizarre hybrid turnofthecentury Russian gazebo behind the main palace building Make sure to check out the impressive Buddhist bells on the grounds of the palace The contrast with surrounding modern buildings is striking and makes for a good photo But the most impressive thing to see is actually the changing of the guard where sentinels in colorful Joseon dynasty costumes parade about in front of the entrance gate If you arrive 15 or 20 minutes before the changing of the guard go inside the palace grounds to see them marching out of the gate before beginning the ceremony After a short display of martial arts theres a moment when they allow tourists to have their pictures taken with the unsmiling guards; youll only have a few minutes so if youre interested be quick to take advantage of the opportunity Check in advance for the schedule for the changing of the guard Changdeokgung may have the Piwon Secret Garden  the single most interesting Joseon dynasty site in Seoul  but the grounds are enormous; Deoksugung is much more manageable and can easily be seen in an hour
522,5.0,I find that the most interesting thing about this palace compared to the others in Seoul is that shows the JoseonDaehan royal familys late attempts to Westernize which can be seen in the architecture Its a pity that so much of the palace was destroyed by the Japanese after King Gojong died The complex also contains one of the very few historic 2story buildings from old Korea Most buildings in traditional Korean architecture only had one floor
523,3.0,Just around the corner off the Seoul City Hall Plaza lies the royal palace of Deoksugung or the palace of virtuous longevity It is more subdued that other palaces in Seoul yet has an equally long history In addition it mixes traditional Korean imperial architecture with the grand scale of European colonial architecture and landscaped gardens Like many royal Korean palaces it was built in the 1450s and survived centuries until destroyed during the Japanese occupation and then rebuilt A pleasant hour can be spent walking around the buildings and gardens
524,4.0,This palace has history for modern the Greater Korean Empire If you do not know its own history it can be boring as it is only just a residence for royal families There is a free guided tour for brief history of Korean Empire and life of royal families in Seokjo Jeon a modern architecture in early
525,4.0,With all the palaces Ive been to around Seoul I finally got to see changing of guards The temple as I was early was not too crowded compared to other bigger palaces so I had a chance to roam around freely and take photographs
526,3.0,Its cool to be there and take some pictures of the guard change Other than that its just a pleasant walk through the palace complex Nothing astonishing
527,4.0,Easily reached by subway and bus this palace holds a changing of the guards show that recalls former glories and offers a quiet place in the heart of Seoul While the buildings are not on the scale of other palaces this is more intimate and gives an idea of a home rather than an official palace It is small but the buildings offer themselves for study and contemplation The gardens hum with the cries of cicadas in summer and eventually as you wander beneath the trees in which they live you come to pergolas and benches to rest on The final stop in your visit must be the art museum  this houses changing exhibitions and so each time you visit you will see something new Currently the art of Le Quede is being shown and this painter of Korea under Japanese rule then divided is worth visiting The entrance price covers both the palace and the art museum  good value for money
528,4.0,I was really lucky to be able to see this Royal Guards exchanging here wich took place at 1430 The whole ceremony took about 15 minutes This really worst watching and inside the palace ground is also really nice This is the only palace ground that have both the Korean culture and the Western culture here
529,4.0,Its just next to the Seoul City Hall Very easy to find  The entry is free So if youre around have a look
530,4.0,This palace is very small and not very interesting It consists of the entry gate a paved courtyard with a throne hall and another building in the traditional style There is also a tiny Europeanstyle garden and 2 large imposing neoclassical buildings built when Korea became an Empire at the end of the 19th century and opened up to the West One of these appeared to be an art museum with no identifiable entry from the palace grounds; the other Europeanstyle palace building was a mystery museum that was not mentioned in any guidebooks or the official Seoul Visitors Guide The sign in the front said a reservation was needed to see parts of the building but other parts could be seen without a reservation Upon entering this mystery building to visit the nonreservation parts I was ushered outside by the nonEnglish speaking staff before I could close the door behind me  clearly I was not welcome despite what was on the English signage The whole complex can probably be seen in 30mins or less The one redeeming feature of this otherwise boring place is the Changing of the Guard Ceremony This is the best show to see in Seoul and is very entertaining with a band martial arts display traditional dancing and military procedure It lasts close to 30 mins and is wellworth seeing The crowd control barriers are placed quite close to the ceremony so you get a much better view than at Gyeongbokgung
531,4.0,Deoksugung Palace is located at the corner of Seouls busiest downtown intersection and is famous for its elegant stonewall road  To see  the changing of the guards is an impressive ceremony involving 50 participants who dress up as Joseonera soldiers and bandsmen  To get easily use the metro line 1 or 2 to City Hall Station The operating hours are 9am to 9pm The entrance will cost you 1000 won for adults and 500 won for teenagers 718 years old
532,5.0,Deoksugung Palace in the intersection of Seouls busiest downtown Close to Citu Hall Station Seoul Subway Line Exit 2 Admission 1000 Ceremony changing the Royal Guards Schedule 1100 1400 1530  Closed on Mondays Also available free tour guide in many languages Provide Tradional Hanbok for free to walk around and take a picture with the guard also free postcards Awesome must try
533,4.0,Unfortunately we were the last tourist to visit there just 10 min before the entry closed But even in evening time the palace still looked beautiful If I have chance to visit here again I would like to come in the day time Good for family or couple the path from the entry gate to the palace square is green and make you feel refreshed
534,5.0,I have always wanted to see the inside of this palace Deoksugung was featured in the popular Korean drama called \xe2\x80\x9cGoong\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Hours\xe2\x80\x9d but its so much more than that Built in the late 14th Century this palace still stands today as a reminder of Koreas rich cultural past For less than the price of using the buses in South Korea people get to walk through the royal palace grounds and see the throne room of the king The mighty throne with two golden dragons swirled in the roof over the throne gives the feeling of power and might During my time there there were two young men who performed with long sabers in an intricate dance of the ancient kings warriors If youre a nature lover the trees bushes and flowers are absolutely breathtaking I highly recommend entering the courtyard in the center and walking down the stone path to kings throne room for that is the very path that many a foreign dignitary had taken The King had a separate room for his queen servants children guests and guards so there are many rooms to look inside of The sparse furniture used back then allows the visitors to see the traditional ways of life for the King It truly is a must see while taking a tour of Seouls historical sights
535,5.0,Theres not much to really say about shrines and palaces but I think the Jongmyo Shrine and Deoksugung Palace is definitely worthy of your visit Youre literally walking in world history and its something that many of us young folks have taken for granted
536,5.0,The changing of guards is the main attraction of this palace Be sure to be on time to watch it and get a nice view And you can have a picture with the guards after the event
537,4.0,A modest price gets you into this lovely Park and Palace complex has some old displays and the National Museum of Contemporary Art If you like contemporary art Preferring the historical background of the Palace there isnt a large collection of buildings but the Palace building is impressive At intervals during the day there is a changing of the guard ceremony at the main gate opposite Seoul PlazaCity Hall It lasts about 10 minutes and there is a lot of marchingdrums beating and shrill horns blaring Dont know the details as it all in Korean but its certainly a colourful impressive ceremony You can hang around afterwards at have your picture taken with the participants
538,4.0,Last month my mother and me visited the Deoksugung Palace It is a must visit as it provides us the opportunity to view how exactly were the Korean traditions its architectural and artistic excellence and definitely the warmth that it possess for tourists even today It has an art museum as well which is worth appreciating The most beautiful is the parade or the ceremony which showcases the true culture of Korea You will also find a coffee shop to refresh and rejuvenate I loved the clock that told the time using the sun in earlier times You will also come to know about the king who lived in Deoksugung Overall its a great place to visit
539,5.0,We went in November and it was raining and cold We were fortunate to arrive just in time for the changing of the guards The experience was terrific and we took advantage of the photo op We happened to take a tour earlier and had learned a lot about the significance of the architecture which made this tour more interesting for us Theres not actually so much to see the buildings are sparsely decorated and you cannot go inside them but it is worth seeing nonetheless if for no other reason than to see the changing of the guard
540,4.0,famous for its stone wall some building still under renovation mixed of korean and western style buildings
541,5.0,We were just in time to watch the changing of the guards ceremony After the ceremony there was a martial arts using sword display by 3 guards Then we were allow to take photos with the guards in their colourful attires It was an hour long event Next we proceeded to visit the palace As in the other palaces there was the entrance then the gate to the throne hall and the open stoned courtyard with stone markers Up in the ceiling above the thrione seat is a pair of engraved dragons Then it was to the other pavilions and buildings There are many tall trees to give shade unlike in Gyeongbokgung Palace and the palace ground is also not so large Right at the rear you will see a nice fountain and the National Museum of Modern and contemporary art at the back Entrance to the museum is free and it is worth a visit
542,5.0,The Palace itself is not that interesting buildings that are empty of fixtures and fittings inside not much to see but the park is nice and there is a small cafe overlooking a lake The changing of the guard is great  such colourful costumes music and deliberate ceremony we loved it Over 65s get in for free and low cost for others Worth turning up for the ceremony which takes place at the entrance to the palace so no need to go inside
543,4.0,We had a great time watching the changing of the guard Vermont that happens 3 times a day 112 and 330 But remember to bring a hat on a sunny day as you will need to stand in the sun for thirty minutes There is water juice and dunkin donuts available just next to the entrance so dont worry about being hydrated The palace is quite nice and lots of walking to do My dad was on wheelchair and we found the place disabled friendly There is a little water garden near the cafe which is not very great One Wednesday in a month they have free entrance also free entrance for 65 and if you are wearing hanbok  Otherwise the ticket is just 1000 won Fun place
544,4.0,We came across this accidentally as we were walking from Namdaemun to city hall Entrance fee was only 1 My wife liked the handsome guard at the entrance  its cool that you can take pictures together Nowhere near as big as the main palace but beautiful and very wellmaintained
545,5.0,We visited this palace and found it was very peaceful and beautiful with the cherry trees in blossom
546,4.0,The Deoksugung Palace is beautifully kept right in the heart of the city With frequent palace guard changing ceremonies and guidedtours in English this was quite colourful and educational Entrance fee is inexpensive and the grounds have been maintained well
547,4.0,Deoksugung Palace and gardens is a mustsee in the middle of Seoul  just across from the City Hall  Seoul Plaza The entrance is via the impressive Sumumjang gate where a changing of the guard ceremony is regularly held Entrance is cheap  free if you are 65 or over and have a passport or driving license They sell a handy little guide book which will fit in your pocket and costs just 500 Won Over the years much restoration work has been needed reflecting Koreas troubled past and rather inconvenient neighbours But the various structures are well worth looking at and on a fine day with the trees in blossom it is a magical place to stroll round
548,3.0,Entrance fee is cheap so worth going in for a look although this palace is pretty small  We were lucky to witness the changing of the guards when we arrive  Take pictures with the 3 guards standing at the entrance They looked nice in their tradtional costume
549,5.0,This palace is one of the smallest but might be the best to go to It is right beside the City Hall It has a very elaborate changing of the guards ceremony at 1100 200 and 330pm It has a pond that turns into a skating rink during winter The National Museum of Art is inside The western style palace of the last emperor has an English audio tour that describes in detail the history and circumstances of the last Korean royal family All of these for just 1000 won per person
550,5.0,Well here is the main place in Seoul I recommend for a couple or family Here is much smaller than Gwanghwamun Gate near here Especially Seokjojeon Hall I love this place
551,3.0,Not the greatest place but when I saw it there was something like a play with made it a little more exciting but you can walk through it in half an hour
552,5.0,I went here around 930 AM and it was nearempty People say that you should wait till later to avoid to tour groups but there was probably 5 other people here when I visited This palace grounds is amazingly preserved and it shows the traditional architecture of the Joseon Dynasty I highly recommend buying the combination ticket for the other palaces if you are going to visit them as well It costs 10000 Won 10 USD
553,5.0,The changing of the guard ceremony is a great show to observe Colorful and musical military precision and expressionless execution by the guard

555,5.0,I found this place better well during Autumn among others I guess each grand palaces has its own distinction Deoksugung Palaces during Autumn flows with warm colors both inside and out Though the place is not as big as Gyeongbokgung you can just sit and relax while having coffee or a Korean ice cream
556,4.0,This is a very nice park to sit and walk in and the added bonus are the palace buildings This part of Seoul has limited green space left over and it allows you even in the winter to sit in a bit of peace for as little as US 1  It has a number of nicer building to look at  one always wonders how much is really old and how much has been restored  And with respect to the ceremonial guards  checkout all the glued on moustaches and beards ;
557,4.0,Most hotels concierge will tell you theres nothing much to see here But this palace is quiet has a mix of architecture styles and is quite interesting Do not miss the changing of guards ceremony and check with hotel the timings especially during winter if too cold apparently there is no ceremony In the Seokjojeon hall theres an interesting guided tour foreigners follow the Korean group with audio guide about King Gojong and his son Sunjong the last monarch of Korea Sadly the Korean tour moves very quickly from room to room and those listening to audio guides are ushered out to another room before its finished The audio guide is very informative
558,4.0,It is a welcome experience to see the changing colors of autumn in parks and palaces and in areas surrounded by flowers and trees One beautiful place to visit is Deoksugung palace A very nice attraction in the middle of the city We wanted to see the trees and the leaves and walk around the whole place and feel the cold wind and the cozy ambience We werent disappoined We got what we came for We even played with the fallen leaves on the ground and took lots and lots of photos Its even more exciting because we got to wear a hanbok for free even for just a very limited time There was the usual changing of the guards ceremony which we didnt watch anymore because we saw them in another palace before Outside there are restaurants where you could eat and rest after hours of walking around the palace
559,5.0,Seoul is a city full of palaces and if you have limited time is not easy to decide which one to go Undoubtedly this was my favorite one  I felt this palace was the main intimate it wasnt the biggest or with the lost impressive constructions but seemed a comfy place To host modem buildings along with the historic sites was an interesting contrast which I enjoyed  The best of all is that at 1100 am we saw a show in the outside quite impressive and free even that we paid our entrance ticket They even allow you to take pictures with the characters for a long period Very sensitive
560,2.0,This late 16th century palace and its numerous reconstructions really fail to impress The park itself is lovely at best with a nice pond and fountain in its middle but the palace is anything but unique The National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art lies within the park but it was being renovated while we visited in August so we could not visit it of course nobody bothers to tell you that when you buy the ticket to the park  apx 1US Skip it
561,4.0,Among all the palace this closed at 9pm the rest like GyeonbokkyungChangdeokgungChanggyeonggung Palace all closed at 430pm a tourism hot spot yet closed at 430pm unbelievable
562,4.0,There are many palaces in Seoul but none are as quaint as Deoksugung Its probably the smallest palace but they have a changing of the guard ceremony on the hour daily What I like the most about this place is that it is smack in the middle of the city so you can see Seouls skyline at night as a backdrop to the many buildings Also there is a westerndesigned structure that I believe has been converted to some art museum Dont forget that this any most other palaces are closed on Mondays and go on a clear night for one of the best palace experiences in Seoul
563,5.0,Cherry blossoms all around Seriously one of the most beautiful parksattractions Ive been to Its like a different world once you step into the gate its like in the middle of Seoul and it seems worlds apart with the serenity  Mustsee if you visit Seoul I think I paid something around 1520 for it but its worth it
564,4.0,After you pay a small fee you can enter this huge park during fall with nice yellow color of the leaves You can spend hours in this park but dont forget the watch the change of the guards This park is opposite city hall The Seoul city bus has a busstop here
565,4.0,Take the subway to City Hall Station line 12 the palace is just beside the station Nice to visit in the evening where the colors and breeze is wonderful
566,4.0,Definitely go visit and enjoy a pleasant couple of hours Well kept grounds and lovely castle buildings Beautiful autumn scenic views in the middle of the city
567,5.0,Beautiful grounds Had a very enjoyable time walking through Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area
568,4.0,Managed to catch the show and was really glad we made it It s something different and interesting The signs stated it would start at 2pm but the ceremony only started 230pmthere were photo opportunities with the guards in costumes before and after the ceremony
569,5.0,Right across the large square from City Hall Beautiful palace as usual in Korea very well maintained A popular place with school children So you get to see plenty of children apart from the impressive palace
570,5.0,Get off at metro called Town Hall and not very far is this Deoksugung Small entry fee and it like a big park and lot of old building to explore around Got cafe and WC on site Most building you cannot go in but they have left door open so you can see throughThe paintwork of assorted colour is beautiful and architecture design are amazing The roof have mini Gargoyles It was a perfect hot day and just lovely to walk around We were Lucky there were Cultural festival that day and all soldier wearing uniform and changing of the guard Big giant drum of gong were played and Korean Band in bright yellow and blue uniform played music As well as important men in their costumes Masses of people stood and watch and allowing to have photo taken with them It was a Great day for a little cost Took us over two hours
571,4.0,Chance upon this place while walking along the main road; I didnt know there were several palaces here in Seoul Its a nice place to visit to talk around enjoying the architecture and the garden The entrance fee was relatively low 1000won
572,5.0,Easy to find this not so big palace Just right in the city centre Subway station next to the gate You can also watch the changing guard ceremony  a few times a day The palace are very calm peaceful and clean There also some snack and coffee shops in front and back corner of the yard where we can sit and relax enjoying the palace surrounding scenery Beautiful
573,4.0,Very quick site to see They have some sort of changing of the guard ceremony daily Costs 1000 won about 1 USD to get in Mix of korean and strange Western buildings Theres also a small museum in the back thats included in the entrance fee
574,4.0,Just strolling around the area sightseeing and poof  out comes a palace out of nowhere Love how you can randomly find something like this out of nowhere and be in awe It was also good timing as they were doing the changing of the guard So relax and enjoy the show By the way  I was alone and kinda wandered into the exit side of the entrance and ended up inside the palaceSo if youre alone wink wink  not sure if theres a fee to get in but feel free to wander and explore that side of the entrance
575,4.0,When you visit this palace please make sure to time it with the guard changing Its really nice to see young men parading 
576,5.0,You really need to visit this amazing palace when you are traveling in Seoul It is one of the Five Royal Palaces in the city all of which are located in the district of Jongno District and Jung District so they are reasonably close on to the other and you can get a cumulative ticket to visit them all Do not miss it
577,3.0,Its nice to found such historical and cultural place in the middle of the city Here you can see the history of the place and found the museum inside the palace area Also theres a small pathway outside the palace that famous because of the view and the story behind it
578,5.0,This is the palace that you can and should see in the evening when the lights turn it into a kind of magic The best 1 admission ever And in a city where so much is rebuilt this has some original buildings
579,5.0,This beautiful historic palace sits in the very heart of downtown Seoul It is nearly directly across from the City Hall building which is an incredible mix of old and new itself  My husband myself and our Korean friend MeeKang spent a relaxing spring day here It is a wonderful respite from the hustle and bustle from one of the largest cities in the world The grounds are shaded and beautifully kept You can pay for a guide or follow along in a pamphlet or map We were lucky enough to have a personal friend guiding us  I am not for certain but I seem to recall her saying that a few historical KDramas had been filmed at this palace The classic Korean architecture has been very well maintained; and you can take a peak into the throne room and personal living chambers of the king and queen themselves  Toward the back of the palace was a small museum with artwork from several wellknown Korean artists Admission is free with your Changdeokgung Palace ticket and I highly recommend you take a moment to peruse the selection within  One of my favorite parts of this palace tour was visiting the first coffee shop in Korea Apparently one of the kings who inhabited the palace was a great coffee lover; so he created a little pavilion in which to enjoy his favorite beverage You can take off your shoes slip on some house shoes and walk around inside of it Its great fun to imagine what it would have been like to witness a real coffee ceremony with the king so long ago  I would recommend visiting this palace on an offday  a weekday thats not so busy perhaps Just remember that most Korean establishments are closed on Mondays I think it only cost 3 or 5 US dollars to gain entrance Im not sure how this would bode for those in wheelchairs pushing strollers or on crutches The outside gardens and walkways would be just fine but once you got to the main buildings and had to traverse the centuries old thresholds I think it would present a challenge  Also not so sure young children would have the attention span to fully enjoy this palace; but older children might have a lot of fun following along on the map and reading the place markers explaining what each building housed and what its purpose was
580,5.0,We visited it around 8pm Supposedly it closes at 9pm but you need to buy the ticket in advance because the ticket counter is closed after 6pm We got a combined ticket for several palaces The palace is beautiful at night There werent many people so it was a really nice visit
581,4.0,Really relaxing palace to visit its smaller and less crowded than Gyeongbokgung I found the combination of Eastern and Western style buildings to be interesting as well The throne hall and other buildings are small but very pleasing to the eye Its also quite easy to reach from the metro and a changing of the guards ceremony is done here I was lucky to arrive right at the beginning of one Admission is cheap and I would advise adding a visit to this palace along with Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung
582,5.0,Great relaxing stroll through Korean history Time your visit and make sure to see the changing of the guard It was pretty interesting You can see most of the grounds in about 30 minutes There is a free modern art museum at the end of the park The entire thing cost about 1 to get in
583,5.0,So peaceful and less busy than any of the other palaces we visited Came with the combination ticket that you can purchase for 10000KRW Really easy to get to using the metro Really Peaceful to sit and relax in if you have time while visiting Some western buildings also in the corner of this palace however these were not open when we went A must see
584,4.0,In the right middle of Seouls central business district you can feel the touches of old Korean royal palace Even though it is not a fullscale royal palace structure of Chosun dynasty you can feel the touches of royal palace buildings in about 30 minute walk Autumn season after lunch time will be the best timing This palace is very close to couple of hotels such as The Palace Lotte Westin Chosun Koreana
585,4.0,The palace is lovely  not as ostentasious as Changdoekgung but less busy and more accessible Try and download the virtual palace app before you get there  its really helpful in explaining the significance of the sites  The Mueseum of Art situated in the palace grounds is small but very well curated During my visit there was a retrospective of Korean art from the 1940s Take a moment on the steps of the gallery to look out over the top of the palace and the city scape behind it the effect of coexistence of old and new is awesome  The changing of the guard happens around 1400 daily  and really is a site to behold Get yourself out of the main gate a few minutes before the start for a good view I found that standing to the sides of the entrance gate provided me with some shade and a really good view There is an opportunity to take pictures with the guard directly after the changing  it makes for some really awesome shots as they stay in character
586,3.0,An opportunity to see how Western architecture sits with Eastern architecture Unlike other contributors I felt it looked out of place but it summarises Korean History A great change away from isolationist policy to the embracing of the West The palace was used by the King after the annexation of Korea by Japan whilst Gyeongbokgung was renovated and rebuilt after its destruction  Expansive grounds but yet again limited information Nothing particularly special with the rooms devoid of furnishings  There are three guards standing outside the museum where many people have there photo taken  I do think it is a real shame that these palaces are not showcasing Korean history as what little I have found on this trip has been very interesting  If you are visiting the main 4 palaces and shrine then get the combined ticket for 10000won It also includes the secret garden tour
587,4.0,I lucked in on Cultural Wednesday  free entry on the last Wednesday of each month Mind you the tickets are only 1000WON Large gardens and walkways buildings from several dynasties and the modern art museum has been installed in one of the modern palaces buildings Alas it was closed for renovations at the time If you are interested in history and architecture it is worth a visit It is not as large as some of the other palaces so an hour or two is probably ample  and be prepared to walk
588,4.0,According to various online resources visitkoreaorg the palace booklet etc you name it Deoksugung Palace was originally belonged to Wolsandaegun 14541488 the older brother of King Seongjong 14691494 of the Joseon Dynasty It became a proper palace when Gwanghaegun 15751641 ascended the throne and gave the palace the name Gyeongungung in 1611 Afterwards the name was then changed back to its original title of Deoksugung  Visitors can enjoy watching the ceremony of the changing of royal guards at 1100 1400 1530 It takes about 10 minutes to finish the show Personally I prefer the Gyeongbok Palaces ceremony better as the compound is bigger over there and the result of the pictures taken there came out way nicer  One interesting building within the palace is the Jeonggwanheon Pavilion  \xe9\x9d\x9c\xe8\xa7\x80\xe8\xbb\x92 Literally the name means \xe2\x80\x9cPalace from which to watch the garden silently\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a very zenlike name This building was renovated and reopened in 2006 It was the first western style building built in the palace in 1900 Widely known as the Kings Lounge it is said to be a place for the King Go Jong to enjoy coffee and snacks and hold various banquets here Influenced by the western culture and lifestyle Go Jong enjoyed drinking coffee and spending his leisure time here The back of the building had secret passageways to the Russian Emissary which still exist today  for more reviews check httppheurontaycomdeoksugungpalaceseoul
589,3.0,Heres a complete link to my review II Deoksugung means Palace of Virtuous Longevity It is actually one of the four main palaces of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty If you have been to the other four palaces \xe2\x80\x93 Gyeongbokgung Changdeokgung and Changgyeonggung you might feel like theres no need to visit this place anymore because it may look just the same But no It isnt In fact when I entered the area I was amazed how perfectly the Traditional Korean palace erect alongside a European structured museum  Since we just had our lunch around the area we just walked from KTO Headquarters to the palace However the fastest and easiest way to get here is through the subway You have to get off at City Hall  Exit no 2  httpsplurkwordpresscom20140517mission1triptodeoksugungEB8D95EC8898EAB681andstonewallwalkwayEB8F8CEB8BB4EAB8B8
590,4.0,Liked this palace  smaller more interesting layout and of course the impressive changing of the guard ceremony It also lies aside the new modern Western residence that the last King built in the early 1900s which we were told will be open to the public probably October this year What makes this palace so intersting is that mix of old and new What was once the garage is now a cafe This coffee habit started life in the Jeonggwanheon Hall where the King drunk his beloved brew  but got poisoned  which supposedly stopped him producing any heirs Great modern stories mixed in with the old history The changing of the guard ceremony a bit staged and a tiny bit off putting when you can see the velcro and the odd Nike trainer on the soldiers None the less a good spectacle and an even better photo opportunity
591,3.0,Since our kids are not really big fans of palace tours we opted to just time our visit to the Changing of the guards Its a delight to watch as we were almost brought back in time with the display of guards in uniforms marching in front of the palace gates There is also a tent across the gate which lends traditional Korean clothes to visitors Photos can be taken with the guards after the ceremony
592,3.0,A beautiful place to sit back and relax but if you are after Temples and dont have much time in seoul I would not suggest this to be the best out of the lot  Its a nice place to have a cold drink and read a book this temple is included in the 5 palaces in one ticket
593,2.0,This is the only attraction that had an admission feebut there was little seemost of the buildings had been demolishedand those that remained had nothing in themthere was an art gallery which I was in and out of in 5 minutespoor reward for a long walk on a hot day
594,3.0,I went here at night so I missed all the guided tour Comparing this palace to the other it is relative small If you are only going to one palace I recommended you to go to the others first
595,3.0,You will find almost nothing but empty palaces The pattern is nice but its can be seen in other places in Korea Ticket is cheap just 1000 KRW but really that cheap is not worth
596,3.0,This is a very small property since much of the original Palace land has been sold off for development The buildings that still exist are nice and there is an english brochure available for 500 won Admission is only 1000 won for adults The whole thing can be seen in under an hour Inside the walls it is very peaceful you can bring a lunch and enjoy a nice meal on one of the benches
597,5.0,Following our visit to Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung we had some time to visit Deoksugung The history of this palace is covered extensively elsewhere and all the practical information required is in the excellent KTO page httpenglishvisitkoreaorkrenuSISI_EN_3_1_1_1jspcid264316  We bought an Integrated Ticket of Palaces which covers Changdeokgung Changgyeonggung Deoksugung Gyeongbokgung and Jongmyo Shrine This was excellent value at 10000 won  After the history lessons at the first two much larger palaces we did not join a tour as the palace is small enough to wander around independently with notes from your guidebook It is situated in delightful gardens with many seats dotted around so you can bring a picnic or rest your weary feet if you have been shopping too much in the nearby area  There is also a Changing of the Guards ceremony at this palace and the National Museum of Contemporary Art is in the same compound  Although this palace is not as big as Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung I gave it a five star rating because of its convenient location right in the centre of a shopping area which means you can just pop in for a quick visit and get some history and culture along with some art as well
598,4.0,Small in size compared to the big and famous gyeongbokgung palace Situated right next to the city hall metro station Very convenient to reach Had the modern art exhibition when I visited But the guard changing ceremony is not to be missed In fact can be better appreciated here as crowd is less If you reach early can take photographs with the royal guards Very friendly But the palace complex itself is small in size and some parts are under renovation hence closed But can spend few hours here
599,5.0,Must visit place To get a feel for culture Just oposite to City Hall Entry 1000won If you lucky you will see parade too
600,4.0,Would highly recommend the changing of the guard ceremony in front of the entrance particularly if you have kids Guards and soldiers are dressed in full traditional costumes and regalia with traditional music playing the background  In the middle of the ceremony the audience is invited to take pictures with the soldiers  I saw tourists in traditional costumes  I think there is a tent near the front providing costumes to add to the experience  The palace grounds are well presented we had the extra bonus if cherry blossoms with the palace buildings here and there along the grounds We found an hour was sufficient to walk around
601,5.0,Situated in the center of the city right at the subway exit Not a very big one which makes it a good choice when you dont have much time but still want to do some sightseeing Entrance is only 1 but theres additional charge for entering the museum located inside Pretty crowded among netizens during lunch time Make sure to check the schedule of changing guards ceremony outside the main gate
602,5.0,While changing guard ceremony is a must see and free at the palace gate you can be part of it by registering at the tent in front of the gate There are also many clothes to lent to visitors to have a taste of traditional costumes men women kids Looks like we are travelled back in time contrasted with the surrounding skyscrappers I was invited to be in full dress and hit the drum as part of the ceremony A white guy looked at me in full guard costume with envy or not If you found it too cold to stand in the wind there is a cafe in wall glass and chairs facing the gate
603,4.0,Nice palace with a variety of architecture to include Korean mixed Korean architecture designed by Russian architecture western style buildings They had some interactive games and the kids enjoyed playing the one that they played We watched the changing of the guard which is scheduled at various times and occurs at the front gate This palace had a nice thrown room that you could go in which was unique If you only have a chance to visit one palace then I would go to one of the others as there are multiple palaces in Seoul such as Gyeongbokgung but if you have time or are going to be in Seoul for awhile then this is a nice visit It only took a few hours Fee is reasonable as we have found most of them to be in Seoul
604,4.0,We visited this palace at night which was very interesting to see all the buildings lit up The grounds are not as extensive as the other palaces so if you can only choose one or two to visit I wouldnt pick this one but if you have time to see them all this one is worth a visit I think this palace is interesting because of its proximity to so many modern buildings history meets the city
605,4.0,It was a truly unique experience to watch the elaborated change of guards ceremony in front of Deoksugung Palace it was like a walk into history The ceremony happens three times a day at 11am 2pm and 330pm Traditional Korean outfits or better known as habok could be borrowed for picturetaking with the guards after the ceremony  The palace itself is surrounded by the busy urban traffic located just above City Hall Subway Station opposite Seoul Plaza Within the ancient walls you will find old Korean palaces and westernstyle buildings forming a stark contrast against the modern skyscrapers of Seoul The charm of the past the beautifully lined trees and the serenity of the palace ground is enchanting Just be sure not to visit on Monday because its closed  If you are visiting during winter drop by the iceskating rink opposite the entrance of Deoksugung and have fun doing one of the Koreans favorite winter sport for as little as 1000KRW
606,3.0,Significantly smaller than the other 3 places in Seoul Only 1000 won to enter so not expensive It does not take long to see all the buildings We did find the changing of the guard at 11am to be quite impressive
607,3.0,This is the smallest of the palaces I visited It was quite cheap but the one with the least amount of information and least restored There is a changing of the guards but its not as elaborate as the other palaces as the space is smaller But it is closer to City center than the rest The museum inside is an additional fee
608,4.0,Deoksugung is one of the four palaces in Seoul and it may be the easier one to access right next to City Hall There is a small entrance fee KRW 1000 I think but it is worth it as you can freely wonder in the park and around buildings with skyscrapers in the background There is also a Museum within the complex at the back where it is possible to view Korean artwork for the early 20th century for an extra fee There is also a caf\xc3\xa9 with a souvenir shop on the grounds  There is also a changing of guard ceremony at the entrance three times per day which is worth watching for traditional costumes and music If you can only see one palace make it this one
609,4.0,It was a unique experience visiting the palace surrounded by the busy city life and traffic Within the walls you witness the old palace in its time The trees were beautiful lining the walk towards the grand palace  While the palace was smaller compared to the Chinese palaces it doesnt loose its grandeur  Best visit in Autumn to witness the foliage of the ginkgo and maple trees  The change of guard is elaborate and not to be missed Check the schedules  Dont miss this
610,4.0,As we stayed at the Westin during our Seoul holiday we could walk to the palace within 10 minutes For a few Wong you can see some interesting Korean architecture and even more important you can relax It was snowing during that day and this made the atmosphere just perfect The palace itself is not that big but it gives you a good idea about the life a century ago Love it
611,5.0,What a pleasant surprise tucked next to City Hall an elaborate and accessible Changing Of The Guards ceremony apparently running all the time; very inexpensive ticket price; immaculately restored and kept grounds and buildings all in a compact space Perfect for the tourist with limited time this gives a reasonable idea of the architecture and style of the glory days of Korea just as the Japanese were taking over There is a constant delicious juxtaposition of the spacious grounds surrounded by the totems of modern life shopping malls and skyscrapers Unlike the much bigger Gyeongbokgung palace where one may feel at times transported to the 17th century at the DeoksuGung you always see the context  the value Korea places on its history and its future both A further plus is the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art tucked in the back of the grounds like a forgotten relative Quite tame and not really very modern the museum is now showing Masterpieces of Modern Korean Painting an interesting set of tableaux clearly designed for a Koreanlanguage audience Still its worth a visit
612,4.0,Deoksugung is easy to get to from Line 1 Metro stop city hall it sits along side the modern western style building I arrived just as the changing of the guards ceremony was starting the ceremony happens every day except Monday at 11am2pm and 330pm After watching the ceremony you can line up and have your photo taken with them the security guards are more then happy to taken your photos The grounds are very peaceful and many people go there and just sit and enjoy the scenery As it is the smallest of all the palaces it is rather plain however due to buying the combo ticket it was worth going in and checking it
613,5.0,Just across the street from the City Hall Plaza where there are often events being held this little palace is a must visit while in the area The park inside is beautiful and the walks around provide a respite away from the busy city outside of the gates There is also a changing of the guard ceremony here that is an extra treat to catch
614,3.0,The smallest of the 4 Seoul palaces on the UNESCO heritage list This buildings and surrounding park is nice for a walk But nothing terribly exciting about it although I enjoyed being there and seeing the architecture
615,5.0,This was the first of 2 palaces we visited We enjoyed this one better than Gyeongbokgung Price was vey low the grounds were beautiful and as an extra treat we happened to be there for the changing of the guard Very easy to access from the Metro line 1 City Hall stop Lots of older buildings to see with English signs Everyone enjoyed this palace
616,5.0,Of all the changings of the guard the one at Deoksugung Palace is the only one that felt personal At this location the changing of the guard is close enough to reach out and touch the guards you can feel the drumbeat and you can take photos with them after the ceremony As a photographer this allows for some wonderful closeup photos If you are going to choose one Changing of the Guard ceremony Deoksugung Palace is the one  The Palace itself is interesting but fell third behind Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung Palace for us One of the Five Grand Palaces of the Joseon Dynasty Deoksugung Palace however is unique in that it offers the only example of a palace built in western style Seokjojeon and the first western style built in Korea The juxtaposition of ancient old and the very modern surroundings is fascinating and disconcerting all at once  Well worth the nominal admission price the best part of our visit to Deoksugung Palace was the ChangingoftheGuard Ceremony outside the main gates a free attraction and one of my favorite in Seoul
617,4.0,Not the biggest palace but right in town and can done quickly if you dont have too much time try to assist to the guards shift change quite entertaining and explained in English
618,5.0,Nice palace to get a rest in the evening Specially nice during weekend to combine with looking on activities in the place in front of the city hall
619,5.0,It was really nice to walk in and really get a chance to walk in the emperors shoes It was calm and peaceful  And the best surprise is the recently dated structures and modern art galary by Korean artists  This palace visit is kinda like ta prohm to the Ang Kor Wat in Siem reap vs this to the Gyeongbokgung palace  All in all still awesome
620,5.0,I enjoyed this Palace lots of history I arrived by subwayline 1 to City Hall the station stop was right at the entrance to the Palace Entrance fee was only KRW3000 which was well worth it there is so much to explore Be sure to check out the Changing of the Guard Ceremony which they do several times a day not to be missed there is also a very interesting Museum and a gift shop which offers some very colorful gifts After visiting Deoksugung check out Namdaemun Market which is a short walk away you will find anything here also a great place to grab a bite to eat
621,5.0,We really enjoyed this Palace We arrived early by subway at stop City Hall line 1 this puts you right at the entrance to the Palace By arriving early we avoided the crowds  were able to get some good photos of the grounds  Palace By luck there was also a reenactment parade with all the people dressed in traditional costumes from the workers right up to the kingemperor Entrance fee is only KRW3000  its a really peaceful place Just remember its closed on Mondays like most things in Seoul regarding tourist orientated business 
622,5.0,One of Koreas grand palaces and located near the City Hall The changing of the guards is one of the attraction at 11h  14h The big drum sound brings in the courtyard the guards in colorful period costumes performing the daily ceremony accompanied by martial drums You have the opportunity to listen to the explanation in English It helps to understand The entry fee for this palace is 3000 won and you need time if you want to understand what was going on in that century and please yourself with photos opportunities The palaces the large pound the water clock shaped like a bell ancient artillery pieces the museum and the surrounding is large you will need time It can also be hot an umbrella could be useful We enjoyed it We love history
623,5.0,Ys the changing of guards is highlight n pls note it is every hrs during show time ie 1100 1200   But most dont know there is a souvenir shop serving drink the view is good and souvenirs are inexpensive but pretty That s why I think you should not miss  After visiting this in the morning you could simply walk to nearby attractions easily You may consider to go there by taxi and arrive exactly in the gate without Any walking and good timing
624,4.0,One of Koreas grand palaces its located near City Hall which probably explains the police presence The changing of the guards happen at around 11AM and 2PM Make sure you catch it since its a treat with men in period costumes performing the ceremony accompanied by martial drums and voice over annotations in Korean and English so youll understand whats going on You dont have to pay the 1000 Won entrance to witness it since it is happening outside the gates But dont scrimp on the entrance fee as inside is a peaceful and expansive compound housing temples retainer housing royal buildings including two Western style buildings that wont be out of place in Europe or Washington DC  There are even replicas of an ancient artillery piece that fires multiple arrows and a water clock shaped like a bell Lots of photo opportunities in this area and its not too crowded
625,3.0,we happened to walk past this palace as the changing of the guard was happening they certainly turn it into a highlight of the palace with narration in a couple of languages  the grounds are relaxing and there is a nice contrast between the low old buildings resting below the higher modern buildings the entrance fee is only W1000 per person
626,4.0,Deoksugung literally means the Palace of Virtue and Longevity in Korean or Chinese It is not well known that the Chinese was very much the official language in Korea although King Sejong created the Korean scripts in the late 15th century  I will mention the modern dimension first The place is near the City Hall One building houses the national museum of art which is not worthy its great name but holds special exhibitions I was impressed by a modern Korean painter who adopted Western techniques in his paintings Also Western style was introduced into the architecture and landscape in the compound  Without knowing the history one will not find the palace particularly interesting So let me add a historical flavor This place was used as royal places twice First was during the Korean resistance to the Japanese invasion at the end of the 16th century Since all others palaces were burned this place served as royal palace for a while It became a royal palace again after King Gojong ended his yearlong refuge in the Russian embassy in 1907 Gojong ascended the throne at the young age in 1863 and was under the influence or control of his father and later his wife He declared himself an emperor but was forced by Japanese to abdicate the throne to his son the last emperor His death and Wilsons 14 Points in January 1919 triggered the March First Movement which aimed at Korean independence
627,3.0,As we were going to City Hall we passed Deoksugung Palace and decided to enter it since we were already there I think we only got charged 1000 won although others say the charge was 10000 won I remember thinking how cheap the entrance fee for this palace was and that was the reason we decided to check it out  If youre going around Seoul in a taxi you will notice that there are many palaces nearby In my country theres only one palace There was a gate called Daehanmun gate and supposedly a changing of the guard but we didnt see one  We went to the throne room of the palace where dignitaries were received You see the seat where the king would sit down If you saw one of those period Korean drama of the Joseon dynasty this is how it looks like It wasnt really huge  We also saw Seokjojeon from afar and it has fountains Unfortunately for us it rained very hard while we were at the throne room and so we didnt really get to visit the rest of the palace  The courtyard very quickly flooded and I dont know how people knelt here during the Joseon dynasty period to give respect to the king The pavement wasnt even smooth and it would hurt anyones knees who knelt there for a period of time  As soon as the rain subsided we decided to leave the palace grounds so we can proceed to where we were really going
628,3.0,This is probably the most accessible palace in its proximity to Seoul city hall but the alterations to it during the long Japanese occupation gives you the impression that this of the three major palaces within Seoul is the most affected A multiple palace entry ticket is good value though palace entry is generally quite cheap and this palace is included There is probably little point in visiting this palace too if you are seeing the major palaces to the north
629,5.0,The palace houses that I visited last September were accessible  one can enter and see some of the exhibits but this time all the houses in the palace ground was out of bounds 10000KRW to entetr the palace grounds The ceremony in front is free though Last year I missed the changing of the palace guards ceremony so this time I made sure I was there early Be sure to check out the time; 11 am 2 pm and 330 pm I was visiting the Deosugung palace at 10 am but a few guards had already came out then Once it started at 11 am it lasted long enough for everyone to take pictures with all the royal guards There is a make shift tent by the gate where you can put on the Hanbok dress for free and take pictures with the guardsI was at the changing of the palace guards ceremony at the Gwanghamun palace too and I think the Deoksugung one was a more colorful experience with a guard that looked like a warrior agent answering my friends question about his role during the Joseon Dynasty This visit made my day and my week in Seoul
630,5.0,You can be the Commander of the guards during the Changing of the Guards Ceremony through httproyalguardkr A fantastic experience You get to wear to wear the costumes and perform in the changing of the guard ceremony I thought I would just be a guard standing in the backgroundbut actually you are the general and all eyes are on you during the ceremony  
631,4.0,Be aware of time if you want to see changing of the guard with traditional soldiers which can be organized at around 300PM Beside historical building some modern buildings inside makes this place very interesting mix of western and Korean style  My trip was in the end of October when the almond trees surround the palace banks dyed yellow fall colors I admired the most beautiful time of the palace At this time the streets Doldamgil the area around the palace as well Jeongdong church is worth a visit  The entrance fee is so cheap just US1
632,4.0,This is a smallest palace I think but does have nicest changing of guards as you can get really up close and personal Also there are some interesting little tidbits within the palace not seen other places It has an art museum but I would mostly go for a nice walk and the guards ceremony
633,4.0,This was our first stop in Seoul as we timed it perfectly to see the 3pm changing of the guard with traditional soldiers Its also right across from the City Hall which at the time had a massive riot police reinforced demonstration Korean style So you may get to see 1000 riot police while watching this 15 min ceremony  Great first sight visit for us and the palace inside is very quaint Had some western buildings inside which makes this place very interesting mix of western and Korean style Only costs 1000won to get in and if you are in this area definitely worth seeing  But ideally you time this with the changing of the guard ceremony although you will see this at the other main palace as well  Walking distance to the outdoor Namdaemung market and South Gate so ideally you combine this with those visits
634,5.0,\xc4\xb0f you have limited time in the citythis is the best place to understand Korean cultureThe palace is smalljust one building to seeThe interesting one is the changing of the guardsIt can be viewed 3 times a day;11001400 and 1530 except mondaysI really enjoyed that seremony
635,5.0,It is only 1000 won to enter the complex which is ridiculously good value The Western style Seokjojeon palace was closed for renovations but the whole place is such a beautiful oasis and you can get good photos of the old buildings with the modern city scape behind Very close to the City Hall A must visit
636,5.0,The changing of the guard can be viewed three times a day at Deoksugung You can all borrow for free traditional clothing and take your picture with one of the palace guards The palace grounds also house a museum of contemporary art The palance is directly across the street from the renovated City Hall
637,4.0,Deoksugung is located across from city hall and is a very quiet attraction when not visiting during the changing of the guard The cost is only 1000 won and is a nice relaxing area to walk around with a little gallery located on the grounds  Well worth the admission
638,4.0,Not the oldest palace but fun to explore and visit the beautiful landscape Was able to watch the changing of the guard and loved the detail put into the uniforms and process
639,5.0,having worked in the busy city of seoul deoksugung quickly became our favourite place to escape to whenever we could as a beautiful peaceful retreat without a doubt this is my favourite place in seoul the grounds are often way quieter than the other palaces and there are beautiful little nooks and crannies to picnic at everywhere there are lovely buildings to explore and amazing tales to learn here  be sure to plan on staying for a few hours here and just soak in the beauty great history but even more amazing perhaps great refuge in this hectic city
640,5.0,Located across the street from City Hall this palace was easy to find There is an entry fee 1000 WON or US 100 to visit the palace we were here to witness the Changing of the Guard Ceremony  Held daily except Monday at 1100 1400 and 1530 the ceremony lasts about 20 minutes Fantastic colourful costumes and narrated in both Korean and English  The was a very strong wind when we were there and that may have been responsible for the small crowd It was an advantage for us as there was no contest for a spot to photograph the event  One of the best free shows weve seen
641,5.0,Some say once youve visited a palace you need not see the others I would rather look at it differently as Id like to think each palace has its own tale to tell This shows a great combination of history and the metropolis within arms reach They even held a Korean Cantata outside which gave the viewers another taste of Korean culture Great place to sit relax and contemplate Very cheaply priced as well I think it merely cost me KRW 100000 to get it 
642,5.0,Amazing how they keep the tradition There was a TVRadio show photography and paint exhibition that time at the city hall just across the street but all eyes on this palace Awesome thing to watch
643,4.0,honestly all the palace look the same for mebut still worth to visit especially for looking up the changing guard ceremony so colorful and so misticaldont miss to take a picture with the guards later on
644,4.0,just happened to walk by to take the metro and realized that it was free on the day I decided to check it out It is a nice park with historical buildings around Although sometimes with many reconstructed  newly painted buildings I feel it loses its authentication a little bit It is nice to see how the eastern and western building combined as the entertainment room was built with Russian Architect with eastern flare Surely is interesting I agreed with others that if you dont have lots of time around Seoul dont just spend time looking through palaces Just pick one and enjoy other attractions
645,4.0,Visited during Autumn The palace appeared good with colourful trees all over It is very interesting to see and learn of the Palaces architecture and its various satellite structures around it  Will visit again
646,4.0,The sprawling palace grounds contains the palace and many other sattelite building set amidst a park like setting The palace building was getting renovated when I visited so could not get inside not sure if it is open to public in the first place but the rest of the buildings are small one storey wood buildings This dates back to the early eighteenth century and gives one a sense of life  history from back then It is conveniently located near the Namdaemun city center and costs just 1000 Won less than US1 for entry Thee are guided tours I had one morning to spare and visited this place and spent about 15 hours Liked it The only reason I didnt give five stars is that there was no wow factor but it is definitely worth a visit  Hope you found the review useful Enjoy your trip
647,5.0,There are many palaces in Seoul and unless you are spending a long period of time there impossible to visit all so I chose 2 that I thought would have colorful changing of guards ceremonies and I was not disappointed with Deoksugung The Palace is located on the main street of Sejong and more importantly right across the street from Seoul City Hall and Seoul Park You can take the number 1 train green line or the number 2 train dark blue line and get off at the city hall stop Take exit 2 or 3 from the station and once thru the turnstiles look for and elevator It will let you off at street level directly in front of the Palace Check for the times of the changing of the guards but they are listed at 1100 200 and 330 It seems it may be more frequent as I was in that area a number of times for other attractions and it always seemed to be going on Position your self more to the left of the entrance as the procession enters from the stoned and brick side street to the left of the Palace especially if you want to take pics I videoed the ceremony with my Ipad and the pics were great This is a must for any visit to Seoul something that friends and family back home will appreciate Not something you see everyday The grounds of the Palace are spacious and clean but looks barren The day we visited the Museum and another building were closed for renovations and there were very few people on the grounds There are many trees offering shade if a warm day and a teacoffee house toward the back with tables and chairs outside It was just peaceful to sit and look around at all the history and culture of Korean royalty There are a number of buildings to view although the landscaped grounds were not as beautiful as Gyeongbokgung
648,4.0,Catch Royal Guard Changing Ceremony in front of the Palace everyday except on Monday and enjoy the beauty of the Palace especially in Autumn
649,5.0,Deoksugung is important for two reasons it become a royal palace following the Imjin War and was breifly the primary palace until Changdeokgung was rebuilt in the early 17th century Second near the twilight of the Joseon dynasty Emperor Gojong used the palace as a refuge after the brutal murder of his wife  The palace itself consists of roughly 13 of the structures that once stood within the complex The palace is not as beautiful and wellpreserved as Changdeokgung Palace nor as grand as the largely rebuilt Gyeonbokgung Palace Yet I really enjoyed my visit for both the history and pleasant atmosphere within the palace grounds There is one unique feature of Deoksugung the European style palace structure that stands out rather prominantly  For those interested in Seouls dynastic past the first palace you should visit is Changdeokgung the second should be Deoksugung
650,4.0,Its small in size but big in places for great photography and relaxation I went on a Saturday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised that it was not too crowded Try the small cafe to the right of the entrance The setting is idyllic and just great for relaxing
651,5.0,Smaller charming palace in the middle of the city Beautiful grounds to stroll through especially in the fall with changing leaves The changing of the guard ceremony was cancelled due to rain but would be worth stopping by to try and see

654,4.0,I went here alone because Id a free day Its a small palace but interesting enough to walk through
655,4.0,Meet this palace in late afternoon Quite relax mood in beautiful building space Recommend you spent an hour to visit Nice
656,4.0,A nice small restored palace with an interesting Changing of the Guard ceremony as well However the best feature was a Korean traditional culture display held currently summer 2012 every Thursday at 7 pm Korean dance music and song in lovely costumes held in a traditional teahouse previously frequented by the King If you are lucky enough to be around there at that time certainly worth a visit the cultural display is free once you are inside the palace which is inexpensive
657,3.0,My wife and I visited Deoksugung Palace one icy cold afternoon It was in walking distance from our hotel in Myeongdong although I later learned that it was also just one station away The palace is probably the smallest or one of the smaller in Seoul but we found it romantic The grounds were very spacious and full of trees and the architecture was colourful as with other palaces Not much to see to be honest other than a few palace buildings and the changing of the guard ceremony But there is an museam inside the palace ground that provided interesting viewing and respite from the freezing cold There is also a lovely walk around the outer walls of the palace that we thoroughly enjoyed During that walk we had a fantastic lunch at the organic restaurant that is located at the theatre If you time your visit to the palace well you can follow it up with this walk late lunch at the restaurant and a theatre show So Deoksugung is okay on its own but great and conveniently fitted in as part of a walk of the area Do it
658,5.0,Deoksugung Palace as has been said in other reviews is one of the smaller palaces in Seoul But it isnt any less of an experience to visit By having relatively smaller grounds you can walk the entire complex in an hour to an hour and a half seeing all the beautiful architecture from Koreas history But take some time to really experience the surroundings and stroll through the grounds featuring beautifully kept open spaces gardens and walking trails alongside the stunning buildings It was quiet and peaceful even as more visitors arrived we went around 10am The Museum of Art located within the Palace grounds is also another great plus of visiting here  But the main attraction was definitely the Changing of the Guards ceremony The colors and the sounds from the likely hundred or two individuals acting out the ceremony are a musthave experience when visiting Seoul After the ceremony the guards and royal officials remain outside the Palace for you to take photos with them A highlight of the experience is the opportunity for you to dress up in traditional Korean clothing for free A tip dress up before taking photos with the guards Makes your souvenir photos that more special
659,3.0,Its one of the smaller palaces out of the 5 in Seoul but it is still worth the time to visit entrance fee is 1000 won Although the interior of the palace is not as elaborate as the rest there are still things to see such as the royal change of guards ceremony I caught the first one at 11 am If you are up to it you can also experience being a guard as they allow visitors to try on the royal guard outfit for free The booth is situated outside the palace Being a smaller palace does have its own benefits as you can escape from the hordes of tourists that usually visit the bigger palaces The whole place is serene and calm and can be a good place to relax while learning about the history of the palace
660,3.0,Deoksugung palace is placed in the middle of the Seoul easy connection with metro and City sightseeing bus You can easily find it and enjoy the royal guard changing at 1100 Be outside of the palace and it is free of charge Though entrance is not so expensive and it take not so long time to walk around in the palace There is also a possibility to get to the national museum but I did not use possibility During the summer time it can be very hot take some water with you or use public drinking fountains placed inside of the park There a lot of wonderful trees and buildings If you skilled drawer you will find many places to draw
661,2.0,Im not disappointed with this place Poor raying is just means i did not go there frequently this place has good wave and atmosphere convinient and relaxed feeling comes to me when In there
662,4.0,if you come to Seoul you will find out there are several palaces in old town However these all palaces were in one place under diferrent buildings name these name became the each name of palaces now The royal family in Joseon dinasty lived in this big palace but undergoing the fight against outsidersJapanese Russian Americans English French etc who wanted to explore new territory these palaces were witness for the history it is only Deoksu Palace who has mordern buildings inside of Korean traditional palaces which were done in early 1900s by Japanese FYI the original palces were built about early 14 C You can also find Russian styles tea salon where the last second emperor used to receive another countries diplomats You can also find a hosue which has stairs for the 2nd floor That is really rare in Korean history Most of Korean traditional houses do no have 2nd floor nor stairs Anyways that building is not painted either which is also unique When the building was builit the economy of Joseon dinasty was bad so the King decided to be humble not to waste commom peoples money he decided not to paint the building It became symbolic for the following kings so that building remains unpainted upto now to memorise that kings will you can also find more info from the official web httpwwwdeoksugunggokr
663,4.0,Visited Deoksugung as it was within walking distance from my hotel It is compact enough for me to discover on my own without a guide Good photo stop especially as you can see the palace guards in traditional korean garb
664,4.0,Visit a palace or two  this one is a fine example
665,5.0,There is a small garden called Biwon in Deoksugung Deoksugung is a small palace compared to Gyeongbok palace but has so many beautiful stuffs
666,4.0,We visited the place after running around the city all day because its open until 9pm The gates and some of the buildings were beautifully illuminated for evening visits and it gave us a very different perspective from other palaces we visited during the day see photo It was a dark and cold winter evening and there was almost no one on the ground creating a serene atmosphere The museum in the same ground seemed interesting and we wished we had purchased the tickets at the gate
667,4.0,Its the smallest of the 3 palaces but the changing of the guard ceremonie was the best The audience stands realy close to the event It als contains 2 modern buildings
668,4.0,Its very easy to get to from the subway station Therere shows of royal honor guard everday which you can know by tour guide brochures Its not very big and you can finish it in a short time There are also some other attractions near it so you can make a good plan
669,3.0,Right next to City Hall very close to Lotte Hotel The Plaza Westin Chosun Koreana etc Relatively small site and simple So if you are in the neighbourhood definitely worth the KRW 1000 entry fee and the 3060 min spent However not a must
