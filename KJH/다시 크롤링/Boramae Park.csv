21,4.0,Pretty nice little park There is a foot care walk a path embedded with different shapes of stones to massage your bare feet and a foot washing station a track  a military aircraft plaza  a dog park  a few outdoor fitness stations  a tree garden  and a few others  This place is pretty loaded  as far as dense city parks go  My one complaint is that they removed the skate park XGames Park and are putting in what seems to be a new train station That was the only skate park around for miles  Its fairly busy even at 2am
22,4.0,"This is very quit & calm place to spend time with your family or close ones. There is also a children's playgrounds. If you are a nature lover, you can also go there to refresh your mind."
23,4.0,"This park is very varied and therefore caters to many people. There is areas of comparably denser forestry for walking which are quite quiet, a 800m (I think) track and oval, a museum of safety and an area with jet aircraft on display (as there was an air field here at one point), as well as a large water body and many courts and exercise equipment. I'd recommend coming here if you are wanting a peaceful stroll away from the hustle and bustle of the city."
24,4.0,"The tranquil atmosphere, the park was so clean and tidy, there was even soft music playing, it was a great afternoon with lots to do and so close to the subway line 2 ðŸ˜€ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²"
25,4.0,"There are plenty of things to do here: basketball, tennis, jogging, and walking. This is one of the few large parks in Seoul and probably more beautiful in spring since the grass is pretty brown in winter. People bring their pets here or just sit on one of the many benches at this park. There's also plenty of grass to play catch with your kids. It's about 10 minutes on foot from Sindaebang Station and two blocks from Boramae Hospital."
26,4.0,"It's common knowledge that swish lift systems in corporate hotels are powered by sucking the souls of residents. Not surprising then that less than 24 hours into a Seoul business trip I had need of green space - well know for recharging soul batteries.  Boramae Park was only a short cab ride away, but it turns out time is relative and can be adversely affected by the square root of a driver with wind. Mine managed 31 belches, or about 2 per minute.  Set down in the wrong spot with a farewell grunt/burp, I discovered the park through a series of woodland paths, accessed behind a hospital. You should try the paths. Pedestrians move slowly, light shimmers through trees and there's a general lack of pooping pets.  Boramae is set across several steps and was once an Airforce base, which explains being greeted by a gently rusting and incongruous collection of jets plus bomber and Mash helicopter. Alarmingly two machines contain trapped pilots. Piped Muzak told them to 'drive a little faster' and 'follow the beat of my heart'. Poignant.  The lowest step contains a walking or 'hamster' track, which appears to be impossible to get off. Some folks had been stuck there since the 70s. A little beyond lies yute areas for xgaming; no doubt feeders for the sinister track of ages.  The middle section consists of a pleasant tree and bench lined avenue perfect for people watching and reading. So that's what I did and the people watching was a rare treat.  Occasionally I looked up to be comfronted by gangs of sweet old ladies sporting massive visor and face mask combos, often in camo design, suggesting imminent mugging by geriatric space raiders. Occasionally they'd sit down on the same bench and offer you fishes stuffed with chocolate.  I decided my time was was being called after a gaggle of about 30 soldiers marched/traipsed past with guns slung over shoulders and a listless-checking-smartphone-ratio of about 1:4.  Soul gauge now reading 100%, I hailed a cab to the evil Sheraton D Cube, which is quite pleasant when experienced in the right frame of mind. The ride back was quieter and much cheaper, relatively speaking."
27,5.0,"There are many recreational areas, including basketball courts, skateboarding, sprinting area, soccer field, etc. But there's a lot of people hence, I assume, would require reservations or long waits.  I usually go alone. I enjoy taking my dog with me as there are lots of grass lawns and patches. There are many pet owners walking their pets too. Just don't forget to bring something to clean up after your pet.  It's a nice park and highly recommend it."
