Seoul has only just reopened to the world. It is busy and things are open but it's not as I would have imagined. The shopping is pretty average with some local shops plus high street names like Zara. There are some food stalls (more on the weekends) where you can get street food. Having said the above, each day it is getting busier and more things are opening slowly. Weekends are when things are really busy. I expected things to open a lot later but most things start to close by 22:00."
252,5.0,"Myeongdong is a must-visit when touring Korea. With products ranging from tornado potato chips to designer shoes, Myeongdong boasts everything in Korean cosmetics, food, toys and fashion. Its perfect location (centered in Seoul) allows such resources. The busy hustle of food carts on every street will ensure that you have a delightful time : you simply cannot not ignore the famous elderly woman sitting by the entrance stirring up dalgonas to spice up your visit. Although overcrowded at times, such chaos is what makes Myeongdong the perfect place to take a dive into Korean culture and socialize. Visiting in the morning may also help: Myeongdong is relatively peaceful earlier in the day, although there may be less food vendors."
253,5.0,"Myeongdong is filled with street food of all colors, sizes and tastes. I was brought here every night by my local friends. You literally can buy and eat anything from this street! It’s a MUST!"

255,5.0,"Myeongdong is filled with street food of all colours, sizes and tastes. Equally filled with shopping spots. If you are looking for korean cosmetics, K-pop merchandise, clothes, accessories - Go to myeongdong. Everything from underground shopping to high end stores, you will spend your money. It is interesting to see one cosmetic brand having many outlets in parallel streets. Interesting to see free samples given to women at cosmetic store to lure in them and make them buy products. Street food is very delicious, quick and you can definitely make a hearty meal out of them. You can also see students involved in volunteering work, old people protesting sale of dog meat and preaching about believing in Christianity, large tour groups hurrying up to finish their shopping et al.  Whatever it is, Myeongdong is a fun place to go and spend the afternoon or evening."
256,5.0,"When i visit Korea i always visit Myeongdong its cool. You have to visit it by day and by night. Good place for shopping, eating or for a coffee."
257,4.0,"Lots of shops selling facial products and korean snacks (mainly the almond nuts), though may get repetitive as you walk down the street. Visit Lucky Factory and Brand Market for affordable shirts and t-shirts. Beware of pushy salespeople, you can typically just ignore if you are not interested. As night dawns, street food stalls are set up. There are many restaurants to choose from as well. There is a 8-storey Daiso nearby."
258,5.0,Full of great street food and awesome stores. I recommend trying fried chicken with cheese from one of the carts and u wont regret it i promise u. U literally can buy/eat anything from Myeongdong street. It's a MUST.
259,4.0,"Was nice to arrive via the metro at myeongdong station 6 and the street is in front of you. Very wide and relax street due to Covid and ample space. Nice shops for all and a few street venders. Great side streets with colorful signs and ambiance. Large shopping mall, small mall. Do not hesitate to enter as branded shops are sometime hidden in a small place. Many restaurants for all tastes. Very nice evening with the family. Do recommend this much better than large group mall. Enjoy."

270,4.0,"Go early evening to enjoy the food stalls, & check out the Chicken & Beer bars (that's exactly what they serve!)."
271,5.0,This was a unique shopping experience for the family. There were so many street vendors with just about anything you can think of and lots of food. There are also shops and restaurants in the buildings along the street with more selections than the street vendors so you really need to make a day of it if you have people with you that have the shopping bug.
272,5.0,"many cosmetic and clothing sold the the stall but most sold at the same price. Some restaurants located need to walk the stair up before you can take the lift to the desired level hence not convenience for people who have problem climbing the stairs. Mobile tourist guide (international language) located at heart of myeongdong street, they are every helpful and get you to where you want including how to book tour trip. It will be a plus if there is more english signage to get around seoul"

275,5.0,"Great place for choice, yummy street food and ease of getting around. There are few well known brands from the west such as Zara, Levi’s, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Adidas and H&M for what we saw, could be more as it’s a big place, highly recommend a steakhouse in my other reviews."
276,5.0,"Despite there is a lots of shopping to do (mainly cosmetics and snacks), i use to go there for foods mainly. Don't hesitate to go into small alleys and try small restaurants, lots are quite nice and tasty."
277,4.0,"A must visit when coming to Seoul.Pros- Spacious walkways as compared to say Taipei's street/night markets. 2) Comestic, fashion and foodstuff for snacking relatively affordable. 3) Easily reached via Seoul Metro Stn of Eujiro 1 ga n Myeongdong.4) Wide range of hotels to suit one's budget arnd the area. Cons-1) Their street food are quite pricey for a night market.Average arnd 3000 won for just about any finger food and taste just about average. 2- Can get lost easily as most places in there looks very similar. Nonetheless, a must visit when travelling to Seoul."
278,3.0,"the male street vendors make spitting or grunting noises and stare at people with impure, cynical and aggressive eyes. the female street vendors are loud brazen harpies who love to mess with people. depressing.  it used to be a historical place but not much sign of that anymore."

280,4.0,"This is the place where you can shop any cosmetics and skincare brand in Seoul. They has plenty of shops that is heaven for ladies. On the other hand, the are a lots of street food vendor that makes the street more vibrant.  During my visit on winter holiday, the street was very crowded, even in the cold winter night, the street was very pack that makes it hard for you to walk.  Be careful with the sales ladies that give you for some free samples in front of cosmetics store, once you grab the free samples, they will not let you go until you buy something haha"
281,5.0,"This is an awesome area to shop and have some delicious street food. At night the whole place comes alive and it's just great walking around exploring all the side streets and deciding which street food to try next. So many shops to choose from and if you need some comfort from the west there is always Zara and H&M as well. There are ALOT of beauty shops, as there is all over Seoul. We can back here many times and found something new each time to explore."
282,4.0,"If you are an avid skincare followers, you must go to Myeongdong street for an haul. But I didn't come to Myeongdong for skincare. The street food was reason I came the first time and turned out pretty goooddd. Next stop was Myeongdong Subway exit 6, where you can find heaven of kpop stuff. I bought some for myself hehe."
283,5.0,If you want to buy souvenirs or the best face products or have a cup of coffee in strange place or just enjoy the vibe of street atmosphere just come here and stay longer the 5 minutes :-) Very good place for shopping lovers or people who wants to feel vibe of the city
284,4.0,"The whole area was pretty cool, as there was something for everyone. In addition to all the restaurants and different types of stores (mostly make-up), at night they had a lot of food street vendors. More choices for women"
285,5.0,A great street to walk around. Make up and face masks are really worthwhile. Food is a bit expensive compared to other markets. Retailers really exploit tourism
286,5.0,"This place is just simply the best one in Korea. You can find all kinds of clothing, skincare product, gifts, restaurants, street food, to your favourite Kpop star albums! And they're surprisingly very cheap. Moat of stall sells food from 2,000 won per portion. Although I was mostly there looking for gifts and skincare products, this place is a must visit in Korea. I will definitely find a place very near to Myeongdong Street next time I visit Korea!"
287,5.0,"There are so many shops and people walking the streets that it can be overwhelming if you're not accustomed to that. If you've never been to Seoul, try not to get sucked into one of the beauty stores (like me). They'll offer you something free and next thing you know, you've spent entirely too much money on facial masks!! LOL... It's fun but BE CAREFUL!! LOL"
288,5.0,"Although it was fun to eat the street food, I found it better to eat in some random Korean BBQ restaurant. What makes this place are the makeup and beauty stores. My goodness you will never realize how much skin care and hair care you need (or think you need) until you enter one of these stores. My personal favorite was Tony Moly. If you aren't careful you can blow you entire budget on that street."
289,5.0,So there is so much street food and for fairly cheap. Also there is plenty of high end shops in the area. It is definitely a good spot to check out if it is you frist time in Korea.
290,3.0,"If you plan on shopping for k-beauty here, make sure you come before 2pm. Once the markets start it gets crazy busy. On the first night we thought it was a novelty but we quickly realised that some of the food wasn't as cheap as we thought. Some of them vendors reheat food by using those gas flame lighters so they're not fresh off the grill or reheated on it. As well as it being unbelievably busy, there was rubbish everywhere, it was a bit of a turn off. Worth a visit if you're into k-beauty though but wouldn't come here just for the food stalls. There are some decent restaurants around too in the area."
291,3.0,"There were always a lot of people.  We were only interested in snacks. Pretty expensive. Would recommend going to the local markets instead.  For example, a box of strawberries was sold at W15000 here and only W3500 at Mangwon market...  Nevertheless, it was a place with different variety of restaurants and shops."
292,4.0,should not miss this place. there are lots street food which are very Korean. you can go to restaurants or cafe. Shops - middle range. Crowded coz its popular.
293,5.0,"One of the most popular shopping districts in Seoul and for a reason. It's always crowded, especially during the evenings when all the street food carts are in full swing. I would come here just for the street food from simple veggies to exotic lobsters and shrimps and everything in between. One can find almost every brand here and of course a wide range of cosmetic products. (Carry a stroller if traveling with very small children)"
294,4.0,"Great vibes, great market place for street food and people watching! The beauty shops here also great fun!"

There are many beauty product shops (Holika Holika, Banila n Co, Innisfree, Tony Moly, Lush) and other familiar global brand (Zara, Uniqlo), Tom's Almond etc. The street foods are also good and has many varieties, dont miss to try barbeque lamb stick, strawberry cake/souffle, gimbab, spicy bbq squid and many more."

They also have local grill restos that served good food. We ate during Xmas eve at one of the grill resto- i forgot the name, but the meat was delicious!!!"
298,5.0,"You would already know Myeongdong is good for getting cosmetics and skincare products. Would recommend you to try the street food that come out only at night.  Also if you plan on getting face /body masks, this is the place to get as they are still cheaper than duty free. Not for all products but most."
299,5.0,"fun experience especially at night! shop and eat till you drop. from street drop variety to cool hole in the wall restaurants, and beauty cosmetics and clothing shops- especially beautiful with all the lights in the evening!"
300,5.0,"For first timers to Seoul, this place is ideal...with lots of food options and shopping to do...if you're here for the culinary and shopping experiences! You can have lunch and dinner at different restaurants every day/night (assuming your hotel provides breakfast). Lots of cosmetic shops, with vendors giving out free facial masks in front of their stores, in hopes to wheel you in. Some restaurants have a 2nd or 3rd floor, so do go in and check with host/hostess for availability, and don't just assume there's no seating when the main floor is full. There are lots of street vendors along Myeongdong-Ro (St) where they sell gimbaps, deep fried squids, etc...which you may fancy. For tourists, you will find good exchange rates in this area too. When we were there during Xmas/New Year, there were huge sales everywhere in Myeongdong shopping street… good time to go :)"
301,5.0,"The people are friendly, although when they look like they are handing out samples of things, they are not, they will pull it back and tell you go into store. The street food is cheap but delicous! way to save money. American made clothes are really expensive, I saw very little Korean made clothing, The underground markets are reasonable. But my favorite was really trying all the different foods."
302,5.0,There's a lot of spot shopping in Seoul but this one is the best. Because they have good price. Low price but good quality. If you want some souvenir from Korea this is one place that you should come
303,5.0,"Bustling, energetic and ecstatic! I love the energy here and the street food are pretty awesome. Go to the alleys for cheaper street food!"
304,5.0,"Amazing cosmetics shopping, many other shops too. Different kinds of street food. Very different and unusual experience."
305,4.0,Things are more expensive in Myeongdong than other locations in Seoul.  There are definitely more tourist in Myeongdong . It is very central to everything . But very crowded in Christmas .
306,5.0,"This place is the best place in seoul. This place have everything like streetfood anykind of food you want myeongdong have it...also about shopping street they have everything you dont have to go anywhere in seoul. Everything sell in dongdaemun myeongdong have it....everything sell in gangnam myeongdong have...from shoes, clothing, bags and cosmetic they have complete all stuff"
307,5.0,This area has all the beauty shops. Masks for every part of your body. Bought loads to take home to australia as it is all so cheap. Did not feel ripped off. Do your homework first as to what you want as it can be very over whelming. Evening food markets are amazing every thing was so good that we tried. A must is the kimchi dumplings and korean fried chicken not to mention the lobster tails. Very busy but very safe. Oh bought a few pairs odf adiddas footwear as very cheap.
308,4.0,"It's a well known fact that Myeong-dong is a beauty product wonderland and not to mention, beer and fried chicken.  It's a must go for any first timer in Seoul and also beauty products fanatics.  It's a lovely and vibrant place with tons of street food too. The only downsides are the animal cafes not letting kids in, a pity."
309,5.0,"First time or frequent visitors, this place is a must! Street food stalls are by 4pm everyday until past midnight. Shops and shops and shops, and restaurants after restaurants, cafes and salons and OMG everything you need. If you can, visit this place weeknights, because it’s extremely packed on the weekend."
310,5.0,"This was a great place to shop! We visited on a Sunday afternoon. Plenty of tourist friendly stores. Traditional and touristy gifts, food and candy. Definitely a must-do when visiting Seoul."
311,4.0,"We were in Seoul overnight and wanted to shop for their wonderful Korean beauty products. We stayed at a hotel near Incheon and debated whether to take the AREX Incheon Airport Express train from the airport or uber. The one way train ticket was definitely cheaper at 9,000 South Korean won compared to the $75 USD uber but we opted for the uber due to time constraints. Taking the shuttle back to the airport, finding the express train, and coordinating the train schedule plus a transfer to Myeongdong Street from Seoul Station seemed too much of a hassle and time consuming. Travel time was between 45-60 minutes. Be prepared for the crowds since this was one of the main shopping/tourist streets. The stores accept credit cards but have SK won for the street vendors. We found ATMs in the area. We tried some of the street food but after awhile tired of the greasy fried food. There were some rather unique concoctions: fish shaped waffles, dumplings with red bean paste, and seasoned chicken/rice cakes to name a few. We were there for the beauty products and found Innisfree to have the best selections. We loved: Jeju orchid enriched cream, green tea seed serum, green tea seed eye cream, volcanic pore clay masks, wrinkle cream and of course the masks. The jellyfish vital mask was one of my favorites. Credit cards were accepted plus duty free was an option with a passport. These products can be ordered online but was cheaper in the stores. What was interesting about this area was that there were literally no garbage cans to throw away wrappers etc. from the street food. Fun experience and felt very safe in the area."
312,4.0,The street comes alive at night and better when the weather is a bit cooler. Much nicer than nigjt market in Taiwan.
313,5.0,Fantastic place for people who love to shop. All kind of shops with many cheap things. Lots of street food as well. Love it! Never leave Seoul without going to Myeongdong
314,5.0,Great choices of appetising street food. Good crowd also creates a festive atmosphere. Seems very safe place to go with family. Some very good restaurant as well at very reasonable prices. Definitely an area not to miss when visiting Seoul. I stayed a week in Seoul and been there almost every evening.
315,5.0,"Wow! You have to visit Myeongdong- the shops here are amazing- lots of beauty shops in particular! “Free” face masks are offered to lure you into shops but sometimes you can just take them and keep walking. It is super crowded here so be aware you will be bumped into n jostled a bit- all part of the experience! By about 4pm the street food carts come out- oh my goodness the variety, the look n smell is delicious! Is there anything fried that is not tasty?? No!! Try the crepes with Nutella, banana n cornflakes- yum! Egg rolls, corn dogs, fried chicken- all sooo good!"
316,4.0,"The street was packed with so many shops selling cosmetics at a good price. You can shop them for souvenirs, eat the street food."
317,5.0,"A must visit if you want to do some shopping and have street food! If you know you way around, Namdaemun Market, Myeongdong Cathedral, Bank of Korea Museum and various shopping malls are nearby - although Hoehyeon station maybe closer to Namdaemun market. You have to try kalguksu and mandu dumplings at Myeongdong Kyoja! They have 2 of 3 locations in Myeongdong, but best go to the original place (established 1966?)"
318,5.0,"Very busy, huge Korean and Western stores everywhere with amazing deals. We picked up a lot of awesome clothes and makeup for superb prices. Can strongly recommend."
319,5.0,"This is the place you have to visit if you are in Seoul. I went here almost every day whilst I was in Korea (for two weeks). There is so much here for everyone, in terms of beauty, music, niknaks, food etc. I would 100% recommend going here at night for the market, it is a once in a lifetime experience. The two best things I found in Myeongdong were - Nanta Theatre and Underground shopping centre.  The Nanta theatre was absolutely hilarious and can be loved by people of all ages. The underground shopping centre - found when going into the myeongdong subway station, was okay, there wasnt much there other than niknaks and socks, but there are a few kpop album shops there with such a large range of albums, all for very cheap. I'm from the UK and albums here (mainly bought through amazon) cost 4/5 times more than what I found here. I spent over £1000 on albums whilst here, and actually got my moneys worth, wheras in the UK this would have gotten me 30 albums at the most."
320,5.0,Very interesting place to wonder around. So many shops and side streets full of shops. So many Korean beauty products and also Tom’s flavoured Almond shops. Also there is also a big Art box here as well. It gets busy during the day but that is nothing compared to nighttime when all the street food vendors come out. Please be careful because people will just push and shove when it’s really busy. That being said we still loved the place. Go and enjoy all it has to offer.
321,5.0,"Myeongdong shopping street has all the beauty goods you need to find, every brand , every product. The freebies that comes with every purchase is also quite generous. Watch out for periodic value 1+1 buys if you intend to stay few days."
322,5.0,There’s no shortage of Korean beauty products here. However if you’re looking for just about anything else chances are you’ll find it here. There’s also lots of food choices available.
323,5.0,Shopping street is interesting and fun for everyone . Ladies are the happiness because we get to buy fashionable items .
324,5.0,"This Myeongdong Street seems never ending road. Before our legs breaks from sores, there are still lots more and more to walk. Filled with many nearby shopping centres and of course street food. It’s very Yummy and walking down the streets during winter is superb cooling for us! In fact, it’s quite freezing. Will definitely come back here again!"
325,5.0,"Night street of famous Myeongdong Street Night Foods, famous for its nightlife packs with people around. Had the lobsters baked cheese with read bean and Chocolate pancake that is so delicious and tasty. Is a night so lively not to be missed, environment and atmosphere is always so lively with bursting energy everywhere ☺️☺️☺️☺️.  Had teh lovely dinner over three street of night stalls around the Myeongdong Street walk. Lots of things to see and hang around the area."
326,4.0,"As part of our tour itinerary, we visited the Myeongdong street for a couple of hours. There is a Lotte duty free mall nearby as well, though its more for branded goods. The Myeongdong street was packed with locals and tourists alike. Most of the shops are selling cosmetics, face masks, fashion accessories, and many streetside stalls with local food."
327,4.0,"Interesting area with quite a number of cute places , shops , restaurants and night market . I prefer this area over Gangnam area which is to large and takes too long time to walk. Recomendable for tourists."
328,5.0,Located just along the train station. This place boasts a lot of fashion shopping and food( both street food and restaurants). Really a haven for the foodies even in winter.
329,3.0,"My first impression was cosmetics...cosmetics and lotsa cosmetics although i did see a uniqlo store down the road.. Honestly i didnt go into any of the cosmetics store who offered free masks (only if you go into the store). I ve had my share of experiences where you go in and it would take me all my might to just get out and continue elsewhere. I just walked past and it was a wonderful experience of sights, smell, hustle and bustle of everyone around. You can get lost in here lol"
330,4.0,"Myeongdong Street is super tourist friendly; there are many shops, cafes, restaurants as well as lots of street food and shopping. Most places have English speakers and/or menus, so it is easy to find what you want. This is also cosmetics center, so if you like or want any of those products: this is a place to get it! Don't be afraid to walk around some before you make final decisions on purchases because there are many vendors providing the same foods/products/souvenirs."
331,5.0,"Perfect place for first timer. U get food and u get shopping. This is the place to shop for beauty products. Night market starts at about 4pm where vendors start setting up, buzzling till 11.30pm. very convenient with Myeongdong station and euljiro 1(San) station nearby."
332,3.0,"Street is full of shops selling cosmetics. Sellers will try to lure you into their shops by offering you free mask. In the evening, there will be lots and lots of vendors selling street food. Price of food in this area are generally more expensive than other places like Hongdae, Ehwa Woman’s Univ and Namdaemun Market. Streets are usually packed even on weekdays.  Am giving it a 3 star because i am not into cosmetics and i think the prices are a more expensive too. I think this place is overrated, though i must say there are some pretty good eateries around eg Migabon (portion is smaller than Bon Juk but i found it nicer than Bon Juk) Myeongdong Kyoja (their dumplings are superb) and Yoogane Chicken Galbi. Apart from cosmetics, there are of course other shops/ mart selling other korean food eg almonds, potato chips etc"
333,5.0,"Plenty of stuff to buy especially souveniers. My kids bought loads of socks😊 for themselves as well as for friends. Fila stores are almost everywhere and the shoes are a bargain. Vendors start to setup their carts only around 3pm onwards so will be better to go there after 3pm to soak in the ambience. Hard to find rubbish bin so keep all your trash before disposing them properly. Train station is nearby as well, so will be a good experience to take the public transport. Plenty of cosmetics shops and a good place to buy snacks home as souveniers because it is cheapest here."
334,5.0,2nd time here and I really love it here; bustling and full of energy.  Bought so much stuff here; really went crazy with the shopping 🤤
335,4.0,"Surprisingly, of all the places that I have been to that are famous for street food such as Taiwan and Thailand, I actually like Seoul. I guess the only drawback for Seoul is that the street food is quite expensive and not exactly value for money. However, taste wise I really loved Seoul street food. They have all sorts of delicious food from cheesy lobster go soufflé with strawberries."
336,5.0,"I loved the food street there. If you want to find Korean original Cosmetic you better going to Young Lottee shopping(DutyFree). The difference shopping etude product between Shaila duty free and MeyngDong is the number of things (package)and expired date ( pls check). Of Course the duty free is long than Myeongdong. The price can be diference betwen 3000 idr per item. Its all up to your decision.  I think 2.5 hours is not enough for first shopper like me. In the winter session, (-3 C) you must wear appropiate custom, since this is an outside area. And do not take more than 15 minute in the outside. visit a shop every 15 minute is the best to maintain your stamina.  There are alot of the same shop, so be careful if you make an appointment. be more specific on the location.  Take Care and have Fun.. happy shopping...  Korea have a lot type of Cosmetic, pls brows and learn first about the product that you are looking for before it. its save your time.  The Food there is amazing. I tried grill Lobster with Mozarela, expensive but worthed. Eggbread is safe for muslim. ignore the fried ""type"". Korean street Seller are friendly but good sales person(They wont give up until you buy :).)"
337,5.0,"Just beside Line 4 Myeongdong station exit 5, 6 7, 8, 9 n 10. A lot branded shop, hawker food stall, souvenir shop etc."

Food street is not that cheap though, it can cost you KRW 15,000-20,000 per person if you try 4 or 5 types of food."
341,5.0,"The family loved Myeongdong that we came back more than 4x during our two weeks stay in Seoul. It is different when going in daytime and nighttime.  It is more lively at night with street food vendors putting up in front of the shops selling shoes, beauty products, clothes etc.  Be careful as it is crowded and packed with people."
342,3.0,shopping was fun and reallllllly Interesting the food was delicious.. but there were too many people
343,5.0,"Wife and I only had two days in South Korea, so we had to be very selective in the things we wanted to see/do. Tripadvisor pointed me to this destination so we decided to give it a shot. I honestly cannot tell you how much I ate that night, but I can tell you it was a near endless supply of food for hours.  The stalls on the streets are just knockoffs, but somewhat entertaining to look at and the brick and mortar's offer a wide variety of items to purchase (cosmetics, shoes, dollar stores, etc)  If you only have a few days in South Korea, I recommend stopping by and filling your stomach for a few hours. Bring a lot of Won!"
344,3.0,"I stayed 4 nights in Myeongdong. If you are into beauty n skincare, this place is for you. Lots of masks, toiletries and skincare on sale. As for street food, it’s rather pricey, and sometimes prices vary from stall to stall. A stick of fish cake can cost krw 1000 to krw 4000. I tried grilled scallop which cost krw 10000. The shell was huge but contained very little meat, swimming in cheese. I felt I was eating cheese alone.  The cheese hotdog was nice but you need to ignore the colour of oil used to fry it. Dark brown oil- recycled many times. Common sight at stalls that sell deep fried food.  Stalls sell more or less the same type of food. Always ask for the price first."
345,4.0,"Amazing energy in this city. The crowd just continues to bustle up to 11pm with street food vendors and ‘face mask pushers’ in a backdrop of visual stimulus of bright neon lights and aesthetic display of modern shops.  Great exposure and almost like a smorgasbord of Korean food in bite size quantity peppered at every corner. I would highly recommend trying the street food, it could certainly be good enough to make a meal out of it!"
346,5.0,"My husband and I love shopping and this is a must! There is quite a verity of shops here, lots of cosmetics. If you enjoy shopping and people watching this is the place for you!"
347,4.0,"Lots of brands here. There are deals to be found, but it's more like a pretty high end outdoor mall. There is a soup and dumpling place here that rocked my socks though."
348,4.0,"Quite a shoppers delight mostly for young women. This shopping area features are Korean skin care and cosmetics products. Many of the cosmetic shops offer samples in addition to 50% or more discount for purchases if bought in quantity. You can also have duty free purchases over a certain amount spent. It is also a great area for fashion clothing,shoes and accessories. In the evening this area has so much neon signage that it is almost blinding. As in any shopping area in Seoul there is a great quantity of food stalls and also different cafes and eateries. Quite a challenge trying to maneuver amongst the throngs of shoppers."
349,4.0,Beauty shops are in every corner. After buying their products they will give you free facial mask (10pcs) or their new launch make-up. Street foods have the same pricing. So accessible to MTR.
350,4.0,"Stayed right at the beginning of Myeongdong shopping street. Street have a wide variety of Korean speciality Street food. Having hot fish cake in a soup cup is unbelievable on a freezing cold winter night. The strawberries are superb as well. Since the street caters primarily to tourists, prices are on a slightly high side. Lots of stores selling beauty products at decent prices. Avoid the restaurants though, the prices are high and quality not to the standard where you can find elsewhere."
351,4.0,It is the same night market every where. There are normal goods. A lot of Masks and skin care are sole there. Natural Publish is good quality and popular in Korea. You must try fried lobster in street. It is fresh and nice. Beef steak is nice too.
352,4.0,"Crowded everyday and it has so many skin care shop especially face sheet mask and one time a salesman tried to trick me with giving me a sheet mask for free but when i want to get it, they try to pull me inside their store 🤦🏻‍♀️😀"
353,4.0,"Went here in the midst of winter, in the rain at -6 degrees. Despite the weather, the place was crowded with tourists trying all sorts of street food from cheesy baked scallops to cream puffs. In addition, one can try all sorts of beauty products and cosmetics which is cheaper than other outlets. Just have to be wary of hustlers who will try to persuade you to buy as many of their products as possible and will even reward you with a free luggage bag in you buy in bulk. A good place to shop and eat and enjoy the atmosphere."
354,4.0,"Loved the shopping around here. Everything we wanted for our girls trip. Can’t believe how active it is around the clock everyday of the week. Sales people in the street trying to get us into their stores was a little annoying which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. Great food, products and access to surrounding neighborhoods in Seoul."
355,5.0,"Shopping, eating, sightseeing...it's all here. Almost all kinds of shops can be found here. The street food especially at night really made our trip memorable, it was sooo good! You can see different kinds of people walking around, fun to walk around here."

359,4.0,"During the day this is a street of cosmetics and young fashion, interesting enough and with plenty of restaurants of all Korean varieties with a couple of western ones as well. A labyrinthine network of little streets with shops and restaurants for all tastes. But in the evening it becomes a delight of impromptu stalls making and selling all sorts of Korean delicacies, fruit and drinks. Even some stalls selling costume jewelry and cosmetics. On a cold winter's evening when I was there, plenty of warming snacks and drinks. Not to be missed."
360,4.0,Love the street food in this place. There are a lot of variety compared to some markets. Slightly pricey for the food but quite standard throughout the street I.e. no need to look for best price or haggle.  It was quite crowded on a weekday night (wednesday) up to 930pm when we left. So can imagine it to be worse during weekends. There are also a lot of bulk discounts for cosmetics.  Even though you are not into cosmetics. Can just drop by to eat or soak into the atmosphere!
361,5.0,I stay at the hotel at Myeongdong and had most of my meals here. Great Korean restaurant as well as street food. Hot food during the cold weather. Not to be missed.

It has lots of facial, skin products, trend clothing and foods. It even has a gun range! You can try it for the first time. 14 years old and above. Valid passport and cash of course.  Here you no need for guide, just walk the walk... try not to go on weekends, tonnes of tourists and koreans.  There is self cert halal food!"
366,5.0,A good place to shop! There are lots of stores to see from skincare to fashion. I recommend going to Music Korea if you're a K-Pop Fan since they sell albums at a cheaper price! Don't miss out on the food carts on the main street. You'll definitely miss it once you're home!!
367,5.0,"Soak it all in- the crowds, the street food vendors, retail vendors, noise, smells, etc. Try the spectrum of street food- you won’t regret it. Oh yes, if you get lost and don’t know where north or south is, look for the people wearing red (I think they are known as the Red Angels who are the Tourist Guides) and they will direct you! They also will provide you maps of this area because it is very easy to get lost. Now go and have fun!!"
368,4.0,"Great place to spend an evening. Many shops with great deals of cosmetic product. At the end of the road there are some multi storey malls with amazing food ""delicatesen"" in the basement."
369,5.0,"A great beauty care shopping experience as you'll be spoiled wilth various brands- Tony Moly, Etude House, Face Shop, Laneige- just to name a few. Just in case you missed 1 outlet, worry not. As there are other Franchisees around.  Also there are alot of souvenir shops around.  If you like Almond Nuts, then this is the place you should head to. It's called Honey Bee Almond & Friends (HBAF). There are alot of varieties of Almond- Flavoured Nuts to choose from. Before you decide to buy any flavour(s), please feel free to try the samples provided. Comes in various packaging sizes. There are some sales happening right now.  Some of the highly recommended flavours are: 1) Laver Almond 2) Wasabi Almond 3) Black Sugar Milk Tea Almond (if you like Bubble Milk Tea drink. Similar taste) 4) Tiramisu Almond  Happy Almond-ing...."
370,5.0,Had heard so much about this shopping area but what was on display went beyond all that. This is the place for korean beauty products. Lots and lots of street food joints and you will be spoilt for choices. The food looks visually appearing and everything we tried was yummy. The streets are choc a bloc with shoppers and there it is fun to just sit somewhere munching on the food and watch the world go buy. You can spend hours at this place. A must visit if you are in Seoul
371,5.0,"Paradise for a girls soul. Cosmetic haven and absolute delight for Korean street food. Everywhere you look, there are shops selling Korean brand cosmetics. Shopping and savoring sumptuous street foods is a walk in heaven. A must visit to stock up on your common and wierd Korean cosmetics"
372,5.0,"Very festive place. All kinds of shops, plenty of restaurants, street foods, etc. It is always crowded. Definitely worth a visit when you are in Seoul. And if you need Won, those small currency exchange kiosks in Myeongdong have very favorable exchange rate, as long as you have 100 dollar bills. With 100 USD bill, you will get within 1% of the daily exchange rate. But with 50 dollar or smaller bills, they might ding you, could be 5% to 10% less of the exchange rate."
373,4.0,Interesting place if you're looking for cosmetics. Go for the street food as the restaurants here serve Korean food that's below par with a higher price. It's hard to bargain even with the stalls and mom-pop kind of retail outlets as I have the impression that they have fixed the prices.
374,4.0,This street is simply a good visit. There are all kinds of shops from stalls to big departmental stores and prices vary accordingly. It has great street food especially at night and it’s a good place to interact with everyday Koreans. It’s worth a visit
375,5.0,The shopping here was fantastic. The Korean face products were not too expensive and street food was awesome.
376,5.0,"This area got it all. Small shops big departments store, food street and restaurants. Gets very busy late evening specially on weekends."

Find shop called, Baviphat where the items here are much cheaper than the other shops. If you are buying from the stalls, bargain as much as you can!"
378,4.0,"Fun place to wander around at night and stock up on k-beauty supplies. Shop employees will be handing out “free” sheet masks in exchange for ushering you into the stores and trying to make a sale, so be prepared lol. This place gets packed after dark w/ tourists and locals alike. Tons of delicious restaurants and street food to choose from, so come hungry."
379,3.0,Good place to spend an hour. Go after dark when the street food vendors have set up and the stores are still open. A bit touristy but good fun nonetheless.
380,5.0,"A good spot to spent your evening here - plenty of food stalls and others like clothing, souvenirs, cosmetics accessories, etc. Take your time to walk from one end of the street to the other. A must visut place whenever you're in Seoul."

385,4.0,This is a must do if you visit Seoul! The street food is fantastic. It however gets really crowded and you see the same cosmetic shops scattered all over the place. The staff at the cosmetic shops here are not as friendly as those in other parts of Seoul and not so willing to give samples as compared to past visits; but a still must do when you are in Seoul.
386,5.0,"If you love shopping, this is a good place to be. Very busy street, lots of big brands have shops here. It's also nice to be here at nighttime."
387,5.0,"First night in Seoul, we head over after dinner not knowing what to expect. We used an undercrossing, and as soon as you started back up the stairs, the smell of cooking food was like a beacon. Lining both sides and in the center of the streets were random booths, selling everything from pop sockets to fish pancakes. Was definitly a great experience walking up and down and seeing all the different vendors, and all the stores behind still open as well"
388,5.0,"I really2 like Myeongdong because I can visit it in night time and it still so full of people... If you looking for cosmetic, this is the place that you should visit. For muslim, there are food stal that has halal logo (even the chicken), just search the halal logo in the stall You can access the shopping district from myeongdong station and walk to euljiro4(sa)-ga (even though the areas near euljiro4(sa)-ga not to crowded. Along with the route you can find cheap cloth store (check out the basement of the store to pay and more goods)"

392,5.0,"I brought my wife here and it was like she was in Disneyland. I’m not into shopping, but it made her super happy. Everything is very cheap with decent quality. It’s not all beauty and makeup products, but it’s definitely a woman shopping zone."
393,5.0,Myeongdong reminded us of Harajuku - it's filled with street food vendors and little shops (mostly clothing and skin care/cosmetics). Great for people watching or getting amongst the throng and wandering around a bit!
394,4.0,"Must try the street food even some are repeatings. For the street clothes stall, we noticed that they are not putting any price tag. I guess if you are tourist, they will just quote you higher price. Please be alert and aware. Of course, the cosmetics is alot and many brands to choose and great offer for masks. During the trips to Seoul, I never purchase any mask even they are in cheap price. Because I have seen alot mask promo, they actually put the mask at outside the store during day time under the sun. Choose those store with tax free and with promo. Plan to go there at least 2-3 days so that you can see which store offering lower price for the same items."
395,4.0,"This is a must do when in Seoul; the street food and whole area comes alive especially at nighttime. Indulge and enjoy... from hearty dishes to dessert, there is something to everyone’s taste. It’s packed with people but generally easy to navigate. Shopping is an added bonus here!"

There are small cafes in area n the area is next to the subway , easy to get to."

399,3.0,"If you love shopping , beauty products , clothes and food., you must go there and i really like this overcrowded area specialy at night with crazy food stands...a real must i would say. Also you can visit Seoul tower and hannam village."
400,3.0,"A lot of shopping options. Good street food options, but we had dinner prior, so we couldn't really eat anymore. Street food probably a bit expensive relatively compared to the restaurant options. Many shops, a lot of tourists, and a bit difficult to move around as there were so many people. Mostly selling cosmetics. Have never seen so many face masks in my life!"
401,4.0,"The first thing we saw stepping out of the taxi is the KoreaMart. We then proceeded to shop for unique Korean snacks, Maxim coffee, chocopie, all kinds of face masks, as pasalubong.  We also tried the streetfood of sausage&tekkbokki, fish cake on a stick. We were too full to try the rocket potato and seafood.  We also shopped at Innisfree. There are a lot of make-up stores here.  There are also many ""tiangge""style sellers of clothes, coats, socks, trinkets, etc.  A must place to visit ecen if you are looking to shop."
402,5.0,It’s definitely one of the most attractive street for shopping in Seoul and it’s highly recommended especially during the sales time. The shops open till 11 PM and most restaurants open till mid night. It’s good place for hanging around with friends and family especially during both the weekdays and weekends. Some goods are sold with a very good price and recommended to buy during sales and reduction session.
403,5.0,Nice shopping street. Suggest to go during early Nov as the cooling weather can ensure you won’t sweat while shopping around here. Recommend to try Innisfree Green cafe. Nice soufflé.

408,4.0,"Has about everything you would expect to include ""bargains "" but I found for some items, just shopping in traditional stores would find the same price or slightly cheaper.

414,3.0,Myeongdong is not what it used to be. Totally disappointed ☹️ streets filled by food vendors and most of clothing shops converted to make up shops:(
415,3.0,"Please make sure you compare prices before you make your decision to buy. Prices vary double. I bought some nuts in a shop which offered tasting. (It looked like special store), it costs W6,300 each. I picked few bags with different flavours and paid. Once I stepped out and walked to the next shop which offered buy one , get one free. Another similar experience was happened in Namdaemun market, I bought 2 packs of stainless steel chopsticks at W5,000 each, at the next shop ( just 3 steps away), it costed W10,000 for 3 packs. This experience told me that I need to compare prices in different shops before I make final decision to buy."
416,5.0,A great place to have anything in affordable and reasonable price. You will love this place and to me is better than others country with such place. Trust me you won't regret as the variety of food and goods to buy is pretty awesome...

418,5.0,"Shop and dine in Myeongdong whenever you find yourself in Seoul. They have everything and more!

421,3.0,Mostly sell cosmetic product and almost all are selling the same type of food just with a bit different taste/ price... the food is pricey and some were tasteless.
422,5.0,"Very alive and vibrant area, for me a good place to explore when in Seoul and it’s best to go there late in the afternoon and in the evening when food stalls are lining in the streets with different varieties of street food. One of the special thing to visit in this area is the dog cafe and cat cafe. It is also a good place to shop for cosmetics and souvenirs, etc."
423,4.0,"A must go in Seoul. Opens till 11-12am. Tows of street food and shopping. Grab s ok me facial masks for your girlfriends and wives. Go for the bbq pork skewers, cheese lobsters and boba tea. Skip the fried chicken cutlet and red bean porridge."
424,5.0,Great place to shop. All of them are smaller shops on both sides of the street and there is no traffic in the street so everybody goes there.
425,5.0,"The Myeongdong Market was easy to get to and the street food was the best. You Can sample fried chicken, octopus, escargot, squid, coffee and shop for clothing. There are so many vendors we loved it."
426,5.0,"When I think of Korea, I think of 2 main things: face products and yummy food! The Myeongdong Night Market helped to kill 2 birds with 1 stone. First off, this market is crowded and very lively. There booths set up on the streets selling food, clothes, and souvenirs. The food was amazing! The 2 main things I would recommend are the Roast Lobster with Cheese and the egg bread. Both were really great. The streets are also lined with some of the most popular Korean skincare brands, including my personal favorite “Holika Holika”. Overall, if you’re wanting to eat some yummy food while sfocking up on face products, I would highly recommend shopping!"
427,5.0,"If you want to shop, eat, drink or just watch the hectic Seoul world stroll by then this is the place for you. There is so much activity, lights, people but it is all safe and interesting. A highlight was the Korean Fried Chicken and beer - I am not a shopper."
428,4.0,"A lot of different types and sizes of shops selling a wild range of products. Is a must-go place for first-timer. There are also a LOT of restaurants. You could spend a whole day here. Moreover, there are also numerous fx shops here."
429,5.0,Highly recommend those who are interested in shopping (clothing/cosmetics) to stay in the area. The street comes alive at night when the food vendors push out their carts. Avoid the overly westernized foods as they are pricey and not very tasty. For those purchasing face masks/beauty make sure you shop around the same product can vary as much as 50% from a different store. Dr Jart masks are a must buy.
430,2.0,"We had a fabulous time shopping and trying the various foods sold along the streets in Myeongdong. The rose ice cream (6000KRW) was especially pretty and yummy. Green tea/yoghurt/strawberry flavour and also chocolate flavour. We also enjoyed Egg Bread (2000KRW), Chestnut, Ginko Seeds, Fish Ball skewers, bbq pork, and much more."

432,5.0,If you are in the Myeongdong area you can get anything you need from here .... from bargains to upscale products as there is a Lotte department store here too.  Not shopping but on a food trip??? Restaurants abound from fine dining to street food. Whatever your heart desires will be met here. Make sure you spend enough time in Myeongdong when you are in Seoul.
433,3.0,"I was not in a shopping mood but I explored the area as part of my vacation workout  too much food to choose from. check out the live seafood (eels and octopus)  cute police station, good place to exchange currency. I saw only 1 street bum.  beauty products.... look at the foam"
434,3.0,Most of the shops closes at 11pm. Restaurant closes earlier. Very busy area with lots and lots of cosmetic shops everyone trying to lure you in with free samples.  Food stalls offers typical street food of Korea.  Worth a visit once.
435,5.0,"Very lively little street at night, both a mix of local culture and lights alongside European influences."
436,4.0,It is best for cosmetics specially the facial masks. The merchants are helpful and willing to give you samples and extra bonus if you buy some. Street foods are many variettes but so so but it is fun to try .
437,5.0,"Every major city in Asia has a shopping area and combined with food stalls. Seoul has one and this place is crazy, especially in the evening hours. While the shop keepers try to lure you in to buying cosmetics, streets are lined with food stalls from either side with plenty of options, reasonably priced and decent quality. If you are a vegetarian, you will have limited choice but to see the spectacle, you must visit"
438,4.0,"If you the type of person who enjoy shopping then Myeongdong is the place for you. from cosmetics, shoes, t-shirt, souvenirs even food you can get in here. if you come in the afternoon, the area is not that packed with people but there's no street food but if you come in the evening there's a lot of people and of course the street is full of street food."
439,4.0,"It's a best street shop for food and drink and sweet ,, cofe The street have a shops and both they sell every thing You can spend 5 ,6 hours"
440,5.0,"This is what we were looking for, an experience of sound, light, food, and aromas that assault your senses. As soon as we began our walk through the area we knew this was the real Seoul we has come to see. Crowded streets filled with pedestrians, flashing neon, and a cornucopia of food to sample and wares to buy. It is something to experience at night or at least early evening, things just get going at dusk. There are all sorts of stores to shop and food to eat, you decide what you want. We just enjoyed taking it all in and strolled the alleys and streets, people watching and observing. I do recommend the fried curly potato on a stick rolled in BBQ seasoning."
441,5.0,"Visited at night when the shopping street becomes a night market after a plethora of booths, almost all selling street food, are set up in the middle of the road.  Because the streets containing the market are wide, there is plenty of room to walk comfortably, without claustrophobia, having to push or being pushed. This gives Myeongdong night market an advantage over every other night market I’ve visited in Asia.  A further plus is the amazing variety of foodstuffs offered. As opposed to other similar markets in Asia you don’t have three, four, or ten merchants offering exactly the same food.  For those who like street food and/or night markets Myeongdong night market is very highly recommended."
442,5.0,"My daughter and I stayed at a hotel right in the center of Myeongdong and proved to be the most convenient! If you are looking for anything For skin care.... this is absolutely the place. Do your research about Korean beauty products, there are a million brands ... it is quite overwhelming .... store after store offer beauty products. Also there are lots of clothing stores, restaurants, coffee shops and much much more. The stores close a little later at night so its a very fun street to walk day or night. On Sundays, all the street food and bargain stalls set up in the middle of the streets making it much more fun even... it was nice to walk around the take a taste of the different kinds of street food. This street is a must see when in Seoul ."
443,5.0,"Been to Seoul countless times, and feel that this is probably still the best shopping place for tourists, especially ladies. It’s practically ladies’ heaven... lots of beauty shops, and fashion shops. Love the street food during the evenings. No matter how many times I’ve been to Seoul, this is still a must go destination whenever I’m there."
444,4.0,"With expectations set pretty high after watching loads of Youtube videos on this neighborhood, I was understandably left feeling 'eh' about it after getting a chance to experience this for a few days.  First off, I loved the vibe of the neighborhood, despite how crowded it became every night. That said, the neighborhood actually is not that big - two main thoroughfares, primarily, each maybe 4-5 blocks long. Lots of side streets with other shops and food options, but the main action really is on the thoroughfares. Lots of cosmetic shops, lots of cheap clothing of the Forever 21 quality level.  The street food was very much hit or miss, nothing completely mind blowing. Lots of repeat stands, but note that not all the stands have the same quality. I tried to use the length of the lines for each as a rough gauge on how good the stand may be - also a hit or miss approach.  Two tips and heads up (literally): - there are a lot of hidden eateries, cafes, and shops in all the buildings above ground level. really pay attention and look up to see what you may be missing out on! I found a few cafes that I loved - grab a coffee and a window seat and you can people watch all the action down below for awhile - garbage cans are really hard to come by. stay with the vendor you purchase food from and chuck your garbage with them after you're done, or come prepared"
445,5.0,"We went down several times in the evening. Street food is very diverse and even finer. The atmosphere is inimitable, real Korea!"
446,5.0,"One can basically shop till they drop as there are countless of shops selling cosmetics, clothes, souvenirs, etc. There are also many restaurants and cafes in the area.  The street vendors will start setting up their stalls from about late morning and finishes late at night. Many of these vendors sell street food as well as other stuffs, so the area is a great spot to try Korean street food.  Do bear in mind that in the evening and night, this place is packed. Also, we found some street vendors are selling some souvenirs at much higher prices than in Namdaemun market.  Overall, it is a great spot for shopping and getting food, whether it is restaurant or street food."
447,5.0,"I ate here most nights. Great location to just stroll and eat. Can get crowded, but that is also part of the charm. Must visit when in Seoul."
448,5.0,Lots of shops and stalls selling everything. I spent the whole might walking around and tried most street food.
449,4.0,"Otherwise known as cosmetic street, I found it very busy and expensive, compared to other places. I also believed I got more samples of cosmetic when I brought stuff in other areas of Seoul. Also restaurants in the are are expensive, and feels a bit like tourist rip off central."
450,5.0,"It's a wide shopping area which includes a ""night"" market. Very colorful, clean, and you can find many interesting things to taste."
451,3.0,"They have 2 Market places, very similar, they have their history, But to crowded, if you do nit have anything to do go"

453,4.0,"Lots of food and items to buy for yourself or souvenirs. I recommend you to buy almonds, cosmetics and clothes if you come here. Dont bother about the restaurants because you will want to try all the street food stalls. The food stalls is not good as Japanese or Taiwanese stalls but they are good nonetheless."
454,4.0,"Everything at hand - food, cosmetics, clothes, things you need and don't need. Very touristy but worth a visit if first time. Vibe is very foodie related! Enjoy ;)"
455,4.0,"Myeongdong is a haven for Korean beauty products. The atmosphere was buzzing in this area. I only visited in the night time and there was an array of street food. One thing to note is that you'll see the same shops every 100-200 metres apart so if you're not looking for anything specific but are on a time crunch, I'd suggest visiting the bigger branches which should have everything. However if you're looking for specific Brands/products, you may have to visit different branches if brand/product isn't as popular. For example, I was looking for COSRX products which I found only to be available in certain branches of Olive Young."
456,4.0,There are numerous shops selling everything you can image. Enjoyed the sights and got some good deals on gifts to take home to family and friends.
457,4.0,A place to buy the lastest and most trendiest lines of cosmetic product. Great place to buy cosmetics souvenir for your love ones.
458,5.0,"We really liked the street food market there. We came there for snacks every day. The best thing were the stuffed puff paste fishes.  The other things you can buy there (Tshirts, handy covers, toys etc.) aren‘t high of quality but the market is worth an experience. Especially since there are good and known shops too."
459,4.0,"A lot of skincare shops along the shopping street, with lots of streetfoods to check out the place well and for you to shop.  Myeongdong is located at Line 4. Easy to find with Subway app and Rome2rio app locator.  My second time in Myeongdong street and its better to travel with your friends and family! But at your own risk since its very crowded and you might get lost. Be sure to know your meet up points in case you are lost.  Be careful also to the sales person who pulls you to buy their product. Be alert!"
460,4.0,"Beauty products, clothings, bags, socks, snacks, street food, cafes, tea houses, everything you need is here. Be sure to have a list before going to this area because you might end up buying things you dont really need. Kpop stuffs are abundant. You can get a lot of samples if you buy from cosmetic shops and they usually give you another item free. Dont get lost by taking picture of the street where you enter so you can go back to that area in going to your place. Street food costs around 3,000-4000 kr won, cosmetics at 1000-75.000 kr won and clothing from 6000-15,000 won for cheapest range. Restos from 12,000-33,000 kr won, its a set meal usually good for 3-4 pax. You will really enjoy this place. A must visit for traveler. A lot of cheap accomodation in the area."
461,4.0,"Myeongdong Shopping District is a must-see if you're travelling to Seoul. I would recommend spending an entire evening walking around and exploing the area while tasting some street food! There is a big choice among typical stuff and very un-healthy desserts. As for shops and resturants there is a wide choice, almost everything is typical from Korea!"
462,5.0,Shopping street bustling with tourists and locals alike. Worth a visit... or 2... street food was expensive and had nothing to shout about though
463,4.0,Cannot move on with the shops and boutiques.hahaHaha I feel good and happy there.will come again later ehh
464,4.0,"Skincare, cosmestics, stationeries, phone accessories as well as some trendy clothings. Most shops offer immediate tax refund, if not, you can try to locate kiosks to do so. You can save more if you buy in bulk with lots of free gifts offered. Tired of shopping? There are many casual eateries and even street food at night."
465,3.0,"H & M and other major brands. Why shop here for what you can get elsewhere? Go to Namdaemun or other ""local"" shopping district for better deals and better prices. Some street food inside, more on the main road outside."
466,5.0,"The whole area is very vibrant and crowded, with a mixture of street stalls, bargain shops and international brands. If you enjoy shopping for make up and clothes this is the place for you. There are plenty of restaurants but the street food is so good you can eat well on the go"

They do deals for tourists like buy 10 get 10 free plus if you take your passport with you they will give you the vat back on it. You dont need to take your passport but it saves the lines once you get to the airport to claim your vat back"
470,3.0,"Initially walked around at mid-day and it was deadsville. Lots of shops and restaurants that could be found in multiple other locations. Happened to come back in the early evening and was shocked by the amount of people walking around, the lights and the energy. Don’t regret going but still didn’t feel it was particularly special."
471,5.0,"very neat and organised shopping street, good stuffs ranging from cheap until branded. the attractive ones are line shop and art box. the place is also very instagrammable problem is quite hard to find that can show the direction in English, since the google maps doesn't help a lot in finding certain spots by walking. Still very interesting place to visit even more than 1 time during one visit. will try again to visit during night time with different ambiences of course. Since it would take a lot of walking, good shoes and nice weather/ season choosing would be important."
472,5.0,"The Myeongdong marketplace is a large area offering a large variety of clothing, beauty products, and food vendors. It comes alive after 5:00 PM with young people and tourists converging into the area. Of special note is the “Cookin’ Nanta” theatrical production located in the heart of Myeongdong. A definite “must see”. Also, if you like lobster, the bbq lobster tails with cheese are scrumptious. Numerous street vendors offer this delight."
473,5.0,Full of tourists and nice ambience for shopping. Good prices and a lot of varieties but a lot of fake goods so beware
474,5.0,"This is a long and small road that has formed a market. Inexpressible by the excitement of this market. This is a street market so it is very fun and too much items. If you are a food lover, this is the street with the most junk food, the price of food is not expensive, only about 10.000won. Besides, this is also a place selling many cosmetics and fashion clothes. From famous fashion brands to ordinary types. The neighboring countries in Asia also see this market as a precursor and create fashion trends for Asia. If you come to this market to shop, you should prepare personal trolleys because there are so many goods here, you will save health and spend more time to shop, enjoy delicious food."
475,5.0,We had no idea how much shopping plays in the lives of the Koreans. This area is like times Square in New York.
476,5.0,"Very interesting varied shopping area. Friendly, helpful and polite venders. Good bargains to be had. At night markets, street food very cheap and delicious. Fascinating to watch the stall holders prep and cook their food- very clean. Area well lit, easy walk, friendly atmosphere, Well worth a visit"

478,4.0,"This is where to come to get the street food in Seoul - there is loads of it available in the evenings. There's also a lot of high street fashion brands, including the Korean affordable brand 8 seconds. Recommend visiting the Myeongdong cathedral at the same time."
479,3.0,Good to see just for the sake of knowing how it looks like in person. But it’s just like any other shopping destinations in asia with focus on beauty and skincare products. Although there are other selections too like clothes and shoes. Street food’s quite nice if you’re starving while shopping. That’s all there is to it.
480,4.0,"A busy areas of stalls down the main side streets of Myeongdong. There is a lot of tat stalls but within there is traditional korean stalls. The variety of food on offer is excellent but beware if stalls don't display a price - always ask first, as prone to overcharge tourists."
481,4.0,"Seoul is plenty of shopping centers, markets,.... but Myeongdong is the top:a jungle of shops, restaurants, bars, hotels,... that will meet your expectations. If shopping is a boring activity, acoording to me, avoid this place."
482,5.0,"This is definitely a great place to stop by. Even if you don't care for shopping too much, they have a lot of great street food options and it's just really cool to see and experience.  If you do love shopping, then this will be glorious. Maybe even to the point that it can get overwhelming. Not only do they have hundreds of shops in a bunch alleys, there are multiple (and I mean MULTIPLE) of the same shop. So, if you're looking for Etude House, you'll probably find 4+ of those. It can get confusing considering how many alleyways there are. Also, the stands will have some shopping too.  Overall, a great place but if you're wanting to shop I'd suggest dedicating at least a few hours. It's a lot to go through."
483,4.0,The most colorful area of Seoul. The paradise of cosmetics and fine coffee. People from all over the world are doing their shopping and at the same time tasting amazing local delicacies from street vendors. Don't be afraid to try them! The market starts from the Catholic Cathedral and reaches the Lotte department store.
484,4.0,"So much to see, so much to explore. The koreans are really good at their pitch sales. The attractive deals and the friendly sales people draw me back night after night to hunt down its bargain. Go in the night, weather is cooler in the evenings in June and the street foods are irresistible."
485,5.0,"If you have clothes or shoes to buy, look no further. You will go crazy at the number of ABC-Mart or fashion boutiques here. Shoes are really much cheaper in Korea! I wonder why that is so though. There are also many roadside stalls selling Korean street food, although there tend to be many shops of the same variety. I think the best experience is to grab any street food you like and munch on them while shopping. By the time you are done, you would be filled with food but empty in the wallet."
486,5.0,"Our Myeongdong street experience is one part of our “fantastically memorable “ Seoul trip. This is a must see experience. We enjoyed the food vendors here and you’ll see how the place is well patronized by people of different culture. The vendors are so kind in receiving tourists who were there to join the fun!! It’s so exhilarating to be there even just to be a spectator😋 the place is easily reached by train, and there are so many things to do and of course buy!"
487,5.0,It is very cozy and lovely the various handmade store.I'd like to highly recommend this store when you visit MyeongDong Street.  MyeongDong 6gil 2-1
488,4.0,It's hard to believe how busy this street is when the rest of Seoul is quiet. This street is a must-visit place. There are so many street foods to try and many restaurants are open late into the night. The best part of this street is the food. Don't miss it.
489,3.0,"Personally, i don’t really like this area but it has some shops i really like, like TopTen10 and Uniqlo. The street food is great though. I was surprised of all the cheap copies of e.g. Supreme that was on sale everywhere"

492,4.0,"If you never see what's night market, then this is the place. You can try all kinds of Korean street food. You can shopping at all kinds of shops. But, be careful if you have young children as they will get lost as it is very crowded during weekends."
493,5.0,"It's just not tired for coming here everyday!!! I love all the sports shop there just too many! I grab most item that is on sale. From face mask of all korean brand to try, make up, sports shoes, bags, ladies clothes, socks, korean snacks, whatever you need it's just here to get. Must try the street food, take a look at the cart stores selling clothes, jackets, korean small restaurant to dine, Cafes, too many aisle to walk just don't get lost or find the Nature Republic Green leaves at the tall wall if going back to the train subway :)"
494,3.0,"Plenty of shops in this area of Seoul and they appear to stay open all night as well. Busy area with lots of local restaurants, street food and national and international chain stores selling mostly clothing, make up and other fashion products. Be prepared to be walking very slowly as it is likely that the crowds in this area will make it impossible to get anywhere fast. Not my kind of shopping area with all the international stores but a good place to visit anyway."
495,5.0,"I really like Myeongdong night market. Its so alive and people of all ages come here, so it's not just tourists. Its a great place for street food and souvenir socks which retail at W10,000 for 11. I'd definitely cone back again."
496,4.0,Massive shopping area with side by side cosmetics and fashion stores making for easy price comparisons. And food stalls that come out at sunset make for a wonderful street food experience.
497,5.0,"Myeongdong shopping street was easy to access as it is near the subway station(exit 7). The shopping street has different things that you could buy such as souvenirs,branded shoes(fila,nike etc),bags and they even have street food that sells halal food which is easy for a muslim traveller like me. So you could grab street food whenever you are hungry while shopping😉 definitely recommend travellers to visit Myeongdong to shop❤️ The price is affordable for certain things as some of souvenirs is pricey but as you walk around you’ll find cheaper ones!!"
498,5.0,"This shopping street was near our hotel so we made sure we checked it out. The streets were so long and we didn’t see where they end. You can find street food stalls here, Korean marts and souvenirs but omg if you are into Korean Beauty products this is the place!!! I was in heaven and bought so many masks 😄✌️Definitely worth visiting!!!"
499,3.0,"This market was interesting,but I found Namdaemun fascinating.If I could only visit one of the two,it would be Namdaemun."
500,3.0,"I loved this place. When we went, there was a huge market with food, crafts, souvenirs, cheap knock offs.. it was lively and smelled like good food the entire way.. great Korean scene. Lots of people, mix of tourists and locals. We had your children so it was difficult to get around with a stroller. Definitely would not recommend letting your kids walk around without at least holding your hand. If you're looking for a deal, it may not be the best place. Could find similar but cheaper stuff in Dongdaemun, especially on weekends."
501,5.0,You can never get enough of Myeongdong shopping street if you are a woman who likes yummy street food and make-up. All the Korean brands are there and the prices are cheaper than in my country.
502,5.0,"Skincare, cosmetics and so many other korean products you can find in this area. Prices are reasonable but it sure is cheaper than buying them from my country. So if youre into korean beauty products there's a line of shops that carry your favorite k- brand that you can choose. You can also buy many other things like korean snacks, souvenirs, cute things and a whole lot more."
503,5.0,"Crowded place. But good to come. Many halal street foods too... if you love skincare products, you should go to this place. I took taxi from hotel near Anguk Station, with just 4000 won... cheap enough."
504,5.0,"Top area to go shopping. Really good street food as well !! All diff. brands there. Lots of shops for cloth, beauty products and other things. Reasonably priced."
505,4.0,"This was our stop before lunch. This shopping district was very not too crowded and we freely walked from vendors stalls to shops without any rush. Some of us were even braved enough to sample free coffee and teas. We purchased some of our first souvenirs and clothing in this shopping area. Prices were reasonable and you can bargain. We had limited time and were only able to explore one end of the shopping area before meeting with our guide for lunch. If I go back I would certainly add more time here. Again, impressively clean. I was too busy to remember to take pics."
506,5.0,"🎋♨️✈️ Myeongdong- A Cosmetic Paradise A cosmetic haven. One can buy, buy and then buy some more and then perhaps come another day to buy few more... and folks that is Myeongdong Market for you. It’s a cosmetic aficionado’s or enthusiast’s paradise.There is a vast potpourri or omnium gatherum of popular Korean cosmetic brands. You could choose or collect all from HOLIKA HOLIKA to Innisfree and Etude House to Tony Moly and MISSHA. The list is never ending. When you feel like taking a break you could pick a fruit glass or choose from an array of grills from the vendors in the middle of the road. Once replenished, you could start all over again. So shop till you drop."
507,4.0,Must to visit at least one of the shopping centers especially the night ones! Unique experience and not that known... its a great surprise while getting informed about the sight seeing of this wonderful city
508,5.0,A nice place to spend the evening with the street foods and shops opened until late night. For middle easterners the a halal restaurant Saffron Restaurant is just around the corner.
509,5.0,Amazing and almost overwhelming! So many vendors to choose from-all assortments of goods and food stalls. Packed at peak times but that is part of the experience! A must see in Seoul!
510,5.0,"In the evening the area becomes a bustling place, with music raging from each & every shop; food stalls, souvenirs, and clothes stalls line up the streets while the lights of commercials and adds placed on the buildings add the finishing touches on this lively & intense place"
511,4.0,"Its full of shops, and it will be no enough for 1-2 hours. Mostly cosmetic and sports shop. We tried to the food street, however we notice they sell the food veryyy pricey as they know many tourist come to the area. As comparison, fish cake in usual street near hongdae is only krw 1000 but in myeongdong krw 2500, same for all street food, all over price.  If you get lost, there is always some person with red clothes who can give you direction to closest exit to subway or assist you to find the shop that you want. They usually stand in middle pf myeongdong.  Love to see around myeongdong but will not buy food from there again."
512,4.0,Found this place the first night we got in as it was only 20 min walk from hotel. They have a several street food to sample. Lots to see for a quick tour of the neighborhood  Had our first fried chicken and beer here

516,5.0,"Myeongdong shopping street and the accompanying underground shopping belt is full of surprises. Look out for the largest Uniqlo, and the “factory outlet” of the famed flavoured nut snacks... nuzzling and busy.  Maybe it’s me but the Underground shopping belt is strangely similar to platinum mall in Bkk...."
517,4.0,"Myeongdong street is a shopping heaven, both for food, goods, and beauty products. It is clean and not rowdy, making it a safe place to roam around even at night. You have to try the street foods, they taste really yummy and cheaper than eating at a sit-down restaurant. You can have a good fill of delicious food just walking around while shopping. Beauty products are sold at stores left and right. You cannot go wrong as Korean beauty products are top of the line. It would be a mistake to come home without atleast buying one beauty product. As far as buying replicated goods on the street, it is not advisable to haggle down on the price as every vendor sells pretty much similar items in the same price. Don’t embarass yourself as they will just dismiss you or worse, you may end up being laughed at or given the dirty look."
518,5.0,"No matter how many times I go to Myeongdong shopping street, I never got tired of it. There are so many shops and people, just very happening place. Lots of nice stuff to buy, apparels, food. We went to the same cafe on 2 consecutive days and will go again if we visit the street in future. At around 4pm, the street vendors start setting up their stalls and the whole place just gets busier.  Highly recommend this place to Seoul visitors."

521,3.0,"i’ve been to seoul several times but i still can’t resist returning to this place to shop every time, particularly for masks and cosmetics. yes, it’s touristy and crowded, and you will be solicited by shopkeepers on the street every now and then (i haven’t encountered anyone particularly aggressive or pushy so they’re easy to brush off), but i would still recommend going there to shop for beauty products as there is a wide variety and the prices are decent."
522,5.0,A few connected streets suitable for walking and full of shops. Great for shopping clothes and beauty products. The street vendors selling food were all very delicious too.

The theater is likewise in this area so you can spend the day here and forget about your worries. Even the shopper with a tight budget has a lot to bring home."
530,4.0,All the famous Korean skincare lines can be found here. So much cheaper buying here than buying them in the US. There are also clothing stores and typical name brand stores on the street. You can also find some really good street food stalls up and down here. There is a nice taxi stop outside the Metro area.
531,3.0,"This is probably the best street if you want to have some shopping in the very city center of Seoul. There're lot of stores, bar, cafè and restaurants, but in my opinion the fashion stores are too commercial and nothing special, they don't represent a good picture of the Korean style. Besides prices are higher compared to the other stores and bar that you can find in the city. Very recommended to young people or to people who like this kind of commercial tourism!"
532,4.0,This is a perfect area to spend your time. A lot of shops from street food to brand name products. Prices are also very competitive. There are also many restaurants that one is spoiled for choice.

Unmissable!"
534,5.0,"Here you can find whatever you want: any kinds of foods, souvenirs, cosmetics, toys and whatever other items you would like to bring from Korea at affordable prices. Majority of shops accept credit cards. Despite of crowds of people, no crime at all and very friendly atmosphere. Better time for visit is from 10 AM till 4 PM on working days."
535,5.0,"We were told that we could get a fast and simple meal from the street food trucks in the Myeongdong area...and mainly that it was SAFE to do so. The streets were mobbed with people of all ages, and the food options ranged from grilled lobster to things I couldn’t pronounce. We opted for the grilled shrimp, fried chicken, and some fruit. Not so easy to eat standing up and being jostled by the crowd, but it was worth the experience, which was so fun!"
536,4.0,Has lots of street food stalls at night. You can try all types of korean food. Those who like cosmetics will live this place. Seoul is quite expensive though.
537,5.0,A lot more beauty / cosmetics shops. Affordable and tasty street food. Street food only during evening until late evening.
538,4.0,"The streets come alive early in the evening and afternoon on Sat. Plenty of food stuff to sample and shopping to one's heart contend. Very convenient to get to by subway or buses. Be prepared to do a lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes and clothes, unless you are planning on buying a new pair of shoes or clothing there."
539,5.0,"Crazy shopping district, particularly nice at night with all the lights on and the street food vendors."
540,4.0,"Lunchtime mid week, it’s hot and humid. The fans are buzzing and there are people all over the place.  The street has shops and it’s buzzing.  I note there are plenty of places to eat together with plenty of small independent shops. For me it was people watching.  I found a place for lunch and it was packed. Aircon was a plus and wifi.  A great place to wonder around."
541,4.0,"There's no doubt that Myeongdong has been so developed that it feels touristic and commercialized. Lots of visitors from all countries at any time of the day. Most interesting things to do here is to:  1. Shop 2. Shop some more 3. Shop till you drop  From cosmetics, Korean groceries, apparels, shoes, etc - you're bound to find something that would interest you. Along the way, there are some pretty good cafe and restaurants. For first timer's to Seoul, I'd recommend staying around this area."
542,4.0,It was very busy with lots of people but lots of good street food. There is an endless amount of shops to shop in. There is something here for everyone no matter your age. I enjoyed it a lot.
543,5.0,"My hotel was literally up the street from this place and boy did I go all 3 nights I was in Seoul. All the beauty products you may want or not want, they have. All the street foods you want to eat, they have. It’s busy, loud but thats the fun part of it. Visitors and locals in one place = organized chaos."
544,5.0,"If you enjoy shopping, this is a place you needto be. The famous korean face masks of varied kinds are available in the various stores on huge discounts. And the variety of food that you can eat while u shop.. its a jaw dropping experience"
545,3.0,Busy streets with every other shop a beauty shop. In addition to beauty shops the area has restaurants and clothing stores but mostly local brands. Enjoyable to walk amidst the street food vendors and sample here and there.
546,5.0,"They have all the ladies (and men's) beauty products. They also have cheap restaurants, outlet stores, and other shops. This place is massive and the layout is confusing but who cares! I'm loving it."
547,1.0,"Avoid this place - full of garbage trying to get tourists to buy beauty products. It is the same 5 stores repeated over and over again, all selling these packages of ""sheet masks"" for your face or your feet. They have ""foreigners only"" discounts, and try to give you a free sheet mask in an effort to draw you into their store (and if you walk 50 m there will be the exact same store with the exact same crap).  If you're afraid to adventure out in Seoul and need to have a meal with the tacky tourist board and translations, then you should enjoy this street a lot."
548,5.0,"This is an excellent market, which has a range of stall selling a variety of food, from kebabs, dumplings, pancakes to tempra shrimps and Gimbi. At night the market gets very busy."
549,5.0,"Myeongdong houses many different beauty brands close to our heart such as Mamonde, Innisfree, Laneige, Etude House, Tony Moly and a lot more! It is indeed the best place for a day of shopping for beauty products. They have many restaurants and eateries and even street food as well, so you will not have to worry of having to walk far to find a food outlet after your shopping. The famous Myeongdong Kyoza is located here!"
550,4.0,"If you are in Seoul, head to this place for some shopping. It's basically a street shopping market. You can bargain too and that's depend upon your ability how well you can do so. One can get a few souvenirs from here."
551,5.0,"Street food is not always cheap and in this case, definitely not cheap. We had dinner before coming down the street and were happy to browse the shops instead. There are plenty of choices of food and shops and you can easily spend a couple of hours roaming here."
552,5.0,I thought this was a really cool spot to check out the shopping and try out some of the street food.  Tried the potato swirl on a stick and lobster with cheese. Pretty good!  It’s definitely busy but worth a visit for anyone that’s in the area.
553,4.0,"Lots to see and do, jam packed with shops selling facial products and clothes, lined with street stalls selling local fare. Full of life, definitely worth a visit (even if you don’t shop like me) to soak up the local culture."
554,4.0,"I’m not fond of crowds and crazy shoppers; so Myeongdong’s beauty shopping mecca doesn’t really spell paradise for me. The only thing that draws me back would be its hardworking purveyors who spend their nights feeding hungry bellies, no matter the weather.  It’s important to note that Myeongdong’s street food are darn expensive. It’s something that definitely won’t fall under cheap eats; as you’ll usually be able to eat a hearty meal in a sit-down restaurant for the price of one or two of these street food finds.  There will never be a shortage of options in Myeongdong Night Market. The tricky part is though is how to strategize what to choose, given that you usually have to allot for queuing time and work with a limited budget and stomach. The Roast Lobster with Cheese (KRW 15000), for example, is an insanely indulgent treat, which serves grilled juicy lobster topped with a fluffy melted cheese blanket. It’s delicious, but it definitely won’t fill you up.  Baked seafood served with hot gooey melted cheese seems to be a popular trend (given that we arrived at the tail-end of its winter season), as kiosks of Cheese Butter Baked Scallops also drew in their own lines. The scallops were humongous; but tended to be overcooked.  The Shrimp King’s Grilled Shrimp (KRW6000) may be an uninspired choice compared to its flashier neighbors; but its perfectly cooked juicy shrimps were addicting. Its sweetness guarantees the freshness of the shrimps and makes them perfectly delicious to eat on their own. They do give you a variety of sauces and dips to play around with though!"
555,4.0,Great place just to wonder around and get lost while shopping. These streets are lined with many shops and cafes. Don't go too early as a lot of places don't open until afternoon. And note that most restaurants close around 8 or 9 but you can find a few open 24hrs
556,5.0,"During our stay in Seoul we visited myeongdong everyday before we went back to our hotel. myeongdong is very good if you like kpop as the underground market has all the CD’s and other merch for very good prices. If you aren’t into kpop the street itself has all the best clothes shops, skincare and other little stalls dotted around from etude house to forever 21. I highly recommend people visit this street at least once on their trip to Seoul! (Also you must get a twisted potato, it was so yummy)"
557,4.0,"Bombarded with masks shops and endless food shops. The night market sells stuff on skewers mostly 4000-5000 won. Too tempting as they smell good. Desserts like ice cream including rose ice cream, cat cafe and witch cafe. Just need to be careful as after spending 30,000 alone won still hungry as they are just tiny stuff"
558,4.0,It'll take hours if one were to stop at every stall. The varieties of things sold ...very eye-catching. Tried quite a number of types of food. The lobster with cheese...very delicious but priced a bit stiff at ₩16 per piece. The Taiyaki there is different from the soft ones normally eaten. Its...crispy/flaky. There are quite a few stalls with the 'Halal' logo but some are like photocopied( not original). So not sure if its authentic. Surprising that quite a number of the stallholders can speak good Malay! Impressive indeed.
559,5.0,"Paradise for a shopaholic. Many shops for every taste. Large shopping centers and small cosmetics stores. Huge selection of everything. Plus a colorful, atmospheric street with local food. I’m writing, but the stomach itself sucked. This is an amazing place!"

561,5.0,"A trip to Seoul will not be complete without shopping and eating along the streets of Myeongdong! As the name says, its a shopping ""heaven"" where you can go crazy over the choices of face masks they sell at quite affordable prices! From various types of street food such as BBQ Prawns, Squids, seafood, ice cream, Juice stalls, you can find quite a number of Halal stalls so Muslim readers, not to worry as they will indicate Halal sign on those stalls selling halal food!"
562,5.0,Lots of street food with trendy shops. Worth checking out for some tax free shopping. Street vendors speak some English and Mandarin.
563,5.0,"The best walking street for shopping in Seoul! Hundreads shops for cosmetics, mixed with mass market clothes stores and street food! The best time to go after 6pm, in the day time there is no charm...and no street food)) Recommend!"
564,3.0,"It’s a fun street to stroll once, not more. Try cute and various street food and shop for cosmetics. But it is super crowded which makes it a bit stressful unless you like crowd :)"
565,3.0,"I recommend to come here once and only once. Come to get your currency exchange. They have the cheapest rates. While you do it, by all your skincare products and eat some street food!"
566,5.0,"One of the famous place to buy or just walk and chat with people. Crowded district where you will find everything you need or not there's a lot of shops, restaurants and you can always find what you’re looking for or what you didn’t expect to find."
567,4.0,"I went here thrice during my stay - twice during the day and once at night. If you want serious shopping for Korean makeup and skin care, go during the day when the street is not filled with food carts. At night, it can be hard to navigate in and out of stores as the crowd and get quite thick. The stores and stalls in Myeongdong sell all sorts of trinkets, clothes, bags, shoes, socks (a LOT of them) drinks and delicacies, including lobster tails!. There is a cat cafe and a dog cafe - I only went to the cat cafe and I enjoyed it! A must-go to even if you are not a Korean make-up fan."
568,3.0,"Shops and shops selling the same things..... Some of these shops employ ""rude idiots"" that stand outside the stores with ""fake"" gifts to entice you to go into the stores with no intention of giving you any such gift. One was shoved in my face as I walked by and as I reached for it, the jerk pulls it away and says ""come in and take a look"".. WTF?? Wanted to punch him!!"
569,5.0,"Lots of shops and small shops, where you can buy almost everything, including gifts and souvenirs, good restaurants and great street food."
570,5.0,"There's all your usual shops down here from JD sports to Nike to cosmetic shops. Additionally there are tonnes of good eateries including my personal favourite BBQ joint in town. There will be tonnes of people, but it's not like it's tourists, it's 95 percent locals. Bring comfy walking shoes and water as the SK humidity is no joke and there's several hills in the area. There are good food places legit at every corner so just take some time to explore."
571,5.0,"Not my first visit but loved it anyway.  It’s a big area cramped full of shops and stalls selling everything under the sun. Many skin care and cosmetic brands at lower prices than Singapore especially when buying in bulk. Other shops selling clothes, accessories, restaurants, nic nacs, shoes, you name it, it’s all there! More suited to the younger crowd though.  Lovely atmosphere to spend an evening."
572,4.0,"If you like shopping this is the place to go .with regards to street food was NOT impressed at all .oily foods seems to take over.you get better food in small Korean restaurants close by ,and much better value for your money"

574,5.0,"Loved walking down here tasting local street foods, seeing the many different face mask products and trying out some very interesting tasting almonds that they seem to love here! Highly recommend spending a few hours walking around here, seeing what the stalls have to offer and enjoying some tasty foods! It’s packed but that makes it all the more fun!"
575,4.0,"So many shops and currency exchange places. Look for the currency exchange shops that are further into the shopping area. You get a better rate. For example, I used the first one I saw right by the main entrance and got 1160 per US Dollar. Further in another stall was offering 1170 per US Dollar. Is a difference if you exchange a larger amount of USC. Also so many shopping, eating, desert, food places to enjoy. We loved walking around here."
576,5.0,I stayed at Myeong-dong and the place is best during the night when the streets are full of food stalls. And the choices of food and makeup products is vast
577,5.0,"Visited on a Saturday during the day which was too busy bit went back again later in the evening when it was more enjoyable to wander around. There are so many interesting shops, lots of lovely street food and a great buzz about the place. Loved it!"
578,4.0,"You can shop for many different brands at Myeongdong street. (Cosmetics and fashion either) It’s always busy and fulfilled with foreigners. You will see many shops for a brand while going along, so do not worry about missing any brands. Furthermore, there was street food market at night with various choices from foods to drinks. *a bit pricey"
579,5.0,"I haven't been back to korea since I moved to United States 40 years ago. I was so looking forward to the visit and ir didn't disappoint. Myeongdong street was one of the places I visited and it was one of the best places I visited, second only to namdaemon market. Picked up a few gifts for friends back at the state. Anyway it was very pleasant experience."
580,1.0,I expected much more from this place. It was basically streets of lots of facial stuff and nothing much more. The clothing and other stuff like electronics are sooo limited. Was a disappointment for me
581,5.0,"Cosmetic,local food,healty items,clothes,shoes . It's right place to find anything especially cosmetic items. However for those love to eat .it easy to find local food."
582,3.0,"This was a great area to shop. But as I went down many different streets, I saw the same shops. Stores like H&M that are anywhere, and local stores over and over. How many do you need in one area? Still, it has a nice feel if you just want to shop. I was looking for something specific and became overwhelmed by street after street of the same thing."
583,5.0,You can enjoy a very good street food or you can eat at a lot of different Restaurants. Also you have a lot of shops
584,5.0,Wonderful time walking around with our family in this area. Very safe and lots of shops. Wonderful atmosphere in the evening with so many places to eat and shop!
585,5.0,"We stayed for 5 days in Loisir Hotel (just a few steps away from shopping street), almost every day we would go here, and we can't seem to find the end of this street. I would personally explore more but since my parents' stamina is not exactly the best, moreover we brought our 20 months old niece with strollers... well you can imagine.  Beware tho that this shopping street is not where the cheap stuff is. Cheap stuff goes to Namdaemun Market nearby. But if you want to experience the crowd, and want to know what's the hype all about, brace yourself for an ocean of people, smoky aroma form the food stalls, and not so clean streets. But hey, that's what we all want to experience, right? Because despite all that, we would totally go back and explore more of this infamous street."
586,5.0,"Was a magnificent arrive ,we walk from our hotel ,the Royal Seoul Hotel,enjoy the several types of snacks from street vendors,cosmetics shops,lots people speak english,you can get chips for your celular phone,drugstore at the corners ,massage feet,...Kool days..!!!!!"

589,5.0,"There is a lot to do in this commercial district in Seoul South Korea. Hundreds of great fast food from shrimp tempura, seafood, pork belly and octopus skewers, caramelized plums, oh my God, my mouth is watering while i’m writing this review. From souvenir spaces to large fashion stores like H n M and so. Even an interactive racoon, cat, meerkat and kangaroo café. We had so much fun. I have to say Korean people are awesome. They’re very attentive and nice."
590,5.0,"With all the shops, cafes, street food, and restaurants, Myeondong is such a fun area to explore. The lights, chatter, and aroma of street food tingle all of your senses. Though a bit touristic, walking through here is a neat way to soak in some of the culture. There are many great deals on food and shopping. Especially, on cosmetics and beauty products!"
591,4.0,"This area of inner Seoul is best known for women's beauty products but I enjoyed the street food more. It was hardly bargain basement prices at KRW5000 for a small box of chicken and rice balls but since we insisted on freshly cooked, it was delicious.  Appears to be a very safe area. Easily accessible by Korail Seoul Metro Line 4."
592,4.0,Great place for cosmetics and popular clothing stores. Street Food also repeats and is ok. Fun cafes for coffee and desserts. And lots of bbq places.
593,5.0,Would you be able to buy the things at a cheaper price elsewhere? Probably. Do you really want to spend the time looking for these stores? Probably not.
594,4.0,"Told by others must go to do shopping. Yes you must go, the snacks, cosmetics and a very famous Michelin star Korean beef soup rice restaurant here. You can compare the price before you buy but I recommend one in the photo later. The beef soup rice is very authentic, it may be a home run business. The plain beef soup rice cost ¥12000 Korean won for each. the side dish of kimchi is unlimited supply. You pay and order before you get seats similar to any fast food restaurant. One thing is the Clinique facial cleanser at the Lotte duty free storey is cheaper than other duty free department store when you buy twin pack. But it is also available at the same price inside the airport at the gate 120 area. I must say only the Clinique brand and I don’t know other brand There is also a five storey Daiso shop with many varieties than any other Daiso so far we have visited. Lots more to tell ..... so prepared your energy to spend a day there 👍👍👍. See below the photos of this shop, they have three shops within the district"

597,5.0,"Visited around 4pm on Saturday. Absolutely nuts - stalls everywhere, shoppers everywhere, food carts serving huge variety of street food. Just amazing to wander through the chaos and take in the scenes. Lots of cheap goods if you are looking for souvenirs from Seoul. Plan for at least an hour to wander, more if you want to eat."
598,5.0,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is bustling with activity. You can't help yourself but spend some KR $ . Name brand of course. In the afternoon at 4pm is the start of all good things ... STREET FOOD. Delicious food of all things grilled or fried. I had the best Chop Chae Noodles, try it. This area is a MUST to visit. In need of a MASSAGE, there are many choices. People will hand out flyers and guide you to them. I personally tried 2 places. Both were clean and massages were good. Take your pick, it will help your aching feet and back."
599,4.0,This place has many shopping malls. It has big department storw for who looking for elengant one. Even for young people. There are many alleys with non brands shops but quite well catch fashion people's intention. Many other cosmetetic shops as well. You can easily lost your way if you are keep walking. Please keep in mind there are a lot of turists and people who is calling you. If you want to visit quite and peaceful place this place is not for you. If you are looking for busy and comnercial area this is for you.

602,4.0,"We were in Seoul in December so Myeongdong Shopping Street(s) were festively lighted up in the evening. It is perpetually crowded with tourists. It's a haven for cosmetic, clothes and jewellery lovers and if you scout around, you may get good bargains. Lots of food vendors in the streets as well. Food is pricier here compared to the nearby Dongdaemun and Namdaemun markets. Nevertheless when in Seoul, you must at least experience shopping in Myeongdong Street. A good tip is to book hotels (there are budget, midprice and luxury hotels so do your homework before you book) nearby so that after a day out and about at the sights, you can have a relaxing walkaround, do some shopping and have your dinner in this area."
603,4.0,"As my hotel is in Myeongdong, I walked past this area regularly. There are the usual malls, shops and restaurants. As expected in Korea, there are many cosmetic and accessories shops targeting the ladies. Not to miss are the food streets. Suggest you visit in the evening to experience the atmosphere and buzz here."
604,5.0,"Perfect place, so much shopping fun. Lots of free samples, and all kids of beauty products souvenirs street foods. The best"
605,4.0,"This place is just perfect for street photography especially after an evening rainshower. Other than that, there are a lot of flagship stores where you can just shop until you drop."
606,4.0,"Myeongdong is a character place in Seoul. I have been there for the 3rd time with my two visits in Seoul. On my first visit it did not reaally make a sense to me, but it was just an ordinary shopping area full of people. My recent trip last June make me appreciate Myeongdong. Why did I say that it is a character place. From the train station you will be greated by a a foreign exchange cum shoe repair shop. The exchange rate is very good. As you go along on the alley left and right are cosmetic shops of different Korean brands. It comes to my mind why the skins of the Koreans are so clear and beautiful. Walk . . . walk. . . and at the middle you will be greated by their iconic theater, the ""I"" tourist information personnel who will assist you if you have any questions. Their is also the Myeongdong Cathedral for the spiritual side ( a must see). There are also lots of Korean restaurants that will answer for your gastronomic needs. One thing, I thought ""Daiso and Uniqlo"" is in Japan only, suprisingly I found it in Myeongdong. And if you will go into food trip (Korean food) lots of it could be found at the middle of the Myeongddong Alley. I know that for every tourist who visited Seoul, Myeongdong will not be missed out"
607,5.0,"Octopus grilled - 8000 KRW Fish cake : 3000 Face masks - but 1 get 2 free (at 10000 KRW)  Experience - priceless. What a lively street, id rate it very high on street food, but if you like the food experience you have to go to Gwangjang market"
608,4.0,There are lots of foods to taste and shops are everywhere. You can start shopping at around 5:00 p.m. until midnight.
609,5.0,There were a lot of offers for sheet mask in Myeongdong street. Many kinds of brand and its up to individual to choose. Buy 1 pack sheet masks yang get another pack for free ending up it costs you very little. I bought quite a number and hope there will be another oppurtunity to shop at Myeongdong street again in future.
610,4.0,"First off: cosmetics, you will find soooooo many brands and they have at least two to three shops in the area, so if what you're looking for is not on one shop, find the location of the other shop of the same brand. There is a tourism office near a big Global Tax Free department store and a money changer along MyeonDong Gil Street. You can get your map there.  Tip: Get the freebie and enter the shop. It doesn't necessarily mean you'll buy. They give free face mask to the people who will enter the store.  Next is the street foooooodss.. the main street is full of different street foods which are must try. We literally went from one stall to the other. Their skewers are great and they have lots of delicious stuff cooking.. If you like to explore street food, try everything out. Especially their very high ice cream. 52cm they say.  Tip: find the ice cream store near Pretty Skin Shop in MyeonDong Gil St. it only cost 2000KRW other ice cream stalls have higher price.  Cafe: there is a Meerkat cafe in the area. You can experience cuddling a meerkat by buying drinks which includes the entrance fee. or you can rest in some other cafes (there are many cafes you could choose from)  Traditional food experience: you may want to go down the smaller alleys near the exits of the area to experience traditional korean food at a cheaper price in a homey atmosphere. We have eaten at a small underground canteen (can't read the signboard) which serves food for as low as 5000KRW with big servings good enough for two people.  Best time to go is in the afternoon to evening, but it is also the busiest."
611,4.0,"I think I know every street here by now. It is a relatively large area with modern shops which attract mostly young people. Girls clothing shops and make up are abundant, as are restaurant and bars. I like the street food the best. There is something for every one. Nearby is the Lotte department store and posh brand section."
612,3.0,"If you are under 35 or shopping for someone who is, this is a 5-star shopping street. If over 35 or shopping for someone who is, go elsewhere. Noisy, crowded, oh-so-young-trendy . . ."
613,4.0,Many stores are along with the street. Nowadays many cosmetics and street food are seen. The street is for pedestrians only. No cars
614,4.0,"What more do you need, lots of shopping, lots of restaurant, plenty of beverage shops, just make sure you bring some comfortable shoes."
615,5.0,"Myeongdong is a wonderful district to visit with Endless shops and eateries.  Lotte, Shinsegae, underground and above ground shopping streets are all in this district. Many good restaurants on Myeongdong ga-gil waiting for you to explore as well occasionally some street stalls along your way can quench your thirsty or hunger.  Myeongdong station is not the correct station for Lotte Duty Free or Lotte Department Store. Don't be misled by the advertisement in the station. Take the Euljiro-1ga Station is much closer.  Use Myeongdong Station exit 6 will bring you right in the heart of Myeongdong shopping streets.  Here is the best place to buy Korea Snacks back home. On Myeongdong 8ga and passing Myeongdong 2-gil but before the main road Sogong-ro, you will find Lotte Mart at your left. The famous Wangjigib BBQ is also here. Lunch special up to 5 pm only 11,000 to 13,000 won.  However, Lotte Mart is not the cheapest for Lotte Products. You can check Korea Mart and other shops along Myeongdong 8ga-gil. Promotions of Korea Snacks are plentiful here and sure will cause you over weight.  Whilst you already reached Lotte Mart, mind as well go across Sogong-ro to Shinsegae Duty free and Department store.  Since you are on Sogong-ro, at the fork, take Namdaemun-ro North to Lotte Young Plaza and further to Lotte Duty Free and Department Store.  You finished off your Myeongdong Shopping Street at Euljiro-1ga station."
616,5.0,"We loved visiting Myeongdong. The tax free shopping is great, there’s great stationery shops (Art Box... go there) and the beauty scene: there’s every brand you could want in both standalone and mixed stores. It’s a must if if you visit Seoul."
617,5.0,"I stayed in the hotel at the center of myeongdong shopping street. The whole street sells clothes, shoes and cosmetics in various brands. It also has some marts, money changer, restaurants, etc. At night it has street food though there are some food are repetitive. But overall, this is a nice place to shop and eat."
618,4.0,"Lots of shopping for the ladies, besides bags, clothings & cosmetics you can also find Daiso, sport wear, and many dining options. Sad to say, Myeongdong is losing its shine as the place have evolved to serve tourist appetite. I hope it’s unique Korea shopping area can refocus on it’s uniqueness."
619,5.0,"Our apartment rental is right on the edge of this large night market, and we have spent our first two nights wandering through the streets here, just taking it all in. It’s full of people and awesome little shops and stalls. Just looking down the streets with all the lights and visual clutter makes you want to take a photo every five minutes. There’s nothing like this in the states!"
620,5.0,"I’ll always pop by myeongdong for food and shopping whenever I’m in Korea 😂 Street food are all good but definitely a little pricey as most tourists will pop by here! Overall, I still enjoy coming to myeongdong despite the crowd. It’s a place where I can get all my shopping done in a day!"
621,4.0,"Walking around in Myeongdong Street Market was an experience for both the pocket and stomach. With lots of street food vendors, this will be a good time filler while waiting for your significant other while they shop. Personally, my favorite snack was the croissant stall (nutella croissant) this was was only 2500 won (2usd). Another favorite was the pork dumplings (3 huge dumplings) for 3500 won. Surely you wont go hungry while going around the street market. There are alot of stores as well with alot of varieties (fake supreme shirts, shoes, belts, bags) to retail stores (Uniqlo, ABC mart - sells shoes) this will definitely be good to go around after a long day touring the city. Stores however close early (between 9pm -10pm). The nice thing about this, you can keep coming back."
622,4.0,"Shopping in this area was extremely fun, if you like to haggle on prices. Vendors almost enjoy the competition to see how high they can sell their wares to you. After proposing our final bid, the vendor scoffed at our offering so we walked away. The vendor actually ran us down and reluctantly accepted our offer! Some of the items our group purchased were; “Air pods” for $7, dash cam mirrors for $24, and an assortment of iPhone cases for under $2."
623,5.0,Nice place Shop for cosmetics some shops offer tax refund and discount with a minimum 30-50k won Streetfoods Branded shops Bakery Resto The cathedral is located here
624,5.0,Love the skin care products. Lovely stunning place to shop for lovely things.  Crowded streets but safe lovely souvenirs to buy.
625,4.0,And shopped a lot too. Be sure to get a map from the people wearing a red shirt since there are many alleys and you may get lost. Lots of cosmetics and clothing stores. There are some kpop merchandise too.
626,5.0,A really lively area. There are so many varieties of foods and goods to purchase from street vendors to stores.
627,4.0,beauty products everywhere. You can get tons of freebies from beauty shops just by walking down Myeongdong. Lots of street food as well but a bit more expensive compared to other place.
628,4.0,"Can be crowded but what's not to like. You will never go hungry along the these streets. We were there friday, Saturday and sunday night and there were the street was lined with small temporary snack shops. Bring lots of cash and have a snack fest!!!"
629,5.0,"Skin care heaven, lots of street food nearby. A little expensive the street food here. A bit of clothes can be bought here. Quite expensive also. Not that cheap. But great shopping experience."
630,4.0,"Very easy to get to, 10 minutes walking distance from our hotel. Totally different feeling when you go during the day and night. I like it at night to try all the street food too."
631,5.0,"This Street Market has many exits. My preferred exit is number 6 because it is right where Uniqlo is. However there are many street foods which really come out more at night. Is street food is not your thing then there are good restaurants scattered throughout as well as shops for clothes, facial products, or souvenirs. If you are walking all day I would recommend getting a foot massage as that really helps to recharge your feet to continue shopping all night long."
632,3.0,"Lots of street food and cosmetic stores. Very convenient. Went there but can’t enjoy too much bcoz too crowded and people makes you keep walking. A lot of cosmetic places. If you buy more than $30000, will do the tax free for you immediately. Bring your passport.  Enjoyed the environment but can’t really have a mood to buy stuffs slowly."
633,4.0,Myeongdong is actually made up of a couple of streets not just one. The main ones and a few side streets have just about every kind of Korean street food. The shops sell mostly Korean beauty products at decent prices. There are cheaper places but this is definitely the most central and convenient.
634,4.0,"This place is huge and crowded. Can find many street food seller around 3 PM till close. A lot of shops to buy cosmetics, clothes, shoes but mostly cosmetics. There are some hotels in the area too and it's easy to find restaurants. Easy to reach using bus, taxi or subway. There are some malls around the area too such as Lotte Young Plaza and Shinsegae. I'm confused why there were some cars still enter some of the streets even when there's a crowd. It's quite difficult to find thrash bin as well."
635,4.0,"Myeongdong is a signature South Korean shopping district which you will need to visit, whether you are a shopper or not.  The side alleys off the Main Street offers many local Korean brands ranging from boutiques, cosmetics, consumer goods, digital equipment etc.  This is a area where you see a young Korea in action. The biggest plus point is that the stalls are open till late."
636,4.0,Many stalls set up on this pedestrian street food zone that is actually a UNESCO site. They serve just about everything on a stick including the tornado potato which originated here. It's crazy crowded and crazy fun for awhile until the tummy is full anyway. I am not into the shopping however and blew that whole thing off. Many high end stores have made shopping one of the main tourist attractions here.
637,5.0,"I totally love this place. It is busy yet you have so much to see. You can find souvenirs, clothes, korean fashion stuffs, food, convenient stores, massage parlour, cosmetics and beauty products stores. Its best to come early (before 1pm) if you want to avoid crowd and the heat. I prefer coming over at night, probably after 630pm, where you have lots of street stalls selling more merchandise and lots of food stuffs. The beauty shops such as Innisfree, Nature Republic and Olive Young is worth a visit as they might have special offers especially if you buy more. This is a long street with many directions to walk about. Just take note of certain stores as landmark for your easy reference. There are some brands which has more than one outlet at the same area. It can get quite crowded at times so pace yourself. A mini usb fan will be helpful... I would recommend this as a must visit especially if you are into shopping, cosmetics and beauty, street food, fashion stuffs and souvenirs."
638,4.0,"Items may be overpriced at street stalls. May help if you do some research on what you want to buy. Can find bargains too. Huge variety of food, clothes and shoes. Avoid if you dislike rubbing shoulders with hoards of tourists, it’s almost inevitable. Appears to be very popular with Chinese tourists."
639,4.0,"We came here multiple nights as our hotel was in close proximity to this shopping and dining area. The family found cutsy accessories for school, classic KPop CDs, cosmetics and some clothing. There were both Korean and foreign chain stores here, above and below ground, and we sometime came across multiples of the same stores that were within a block or so of each other. i don’t know how each of them makes enough to pay their rents.  There were also a lot of restaurants located here and we probably ate at a good number in this area. Overall many different cuisines and styles to satisfy any type of food craving.  Almost every evening the streets were crowded with people and the weather was cooler which made the wandering more enjoyable."
640,5.0,"Usually am not a fan of shopping but Myeongdong had many shops that sell nice food, interesting souvenirs and clothes to be brought home as souvenirs. Possible to spend the entire night here and yet not walk finish."
641,4.0,So much to see and taste.. could of spent a week instead of only one day. Found many good souvenirs for family and friends back stateside.
642,5.0,"We love myeongdong. The ambiance of food, people and shopping was awesome. We came here everyday during our honeymoon trip. We will definitely come here again. Must visit when you are in seoul/myeongdong are..."
643,5.0,I hate shopping but this is not a place to miss just for the experience. Crowds are unbelievable and the stock on display is mind blowing. You can buy anything from genuine brands to counterfeit items. The vibe of the whole place is electric. Got to go as seeing is believing.
644,1.0,"This is a reasonably fine place for some overpriced street food and shopping.  Please avoid the touts on the streets who will try to entice you with some cheap massage packages. As the saying goes, if it is to be true, then it probably is. Once you follow them to the massage parlor, the sales staff there will pressurize you to take up very expensive sessions, if you are not keen, they would exert more high selling tactics. Once you refused to take up any of these exorbitantly priced session and opt for the lower price one, they would turn sulky. As it turned out, a 45 minute session became a mere 20 minute session. When I informed the staff about the session had ended way too early, the staff did not bother and insisted that it was already 45 minutes.  The massage was also woefully bad. Please do not go for any massage in this Myeong-dong area."
645,5.0,"For those interested in Korean beauty products, this is the place to go to. Shops open as early as 9am and close as late as 1030-11pm. It may be best to check out the different shops first and see what their promotions are so you can compare as this can differ from shop-to-shop. However, the downside though is that one promotion given today may be gone or be different tomorrow. Most shops can already refund a certain amount of the sales tax if you meet a certain amount so no need to do this in the airport. This is also the best place to get Korean street food, from fried/griiled food products to desserts. The sellers open at around 4-5pm and close at about 10pm. There are also proper restaurants/coffee shops at every corner so you will definitely not go hungry or thirsty. It is best to bring your own shopping or reusable bag so you don't have to pay for a bag from the store."
646,5.0,"This is the most popular places now in Korea shopping district, you could see plenty of beauty shops around the area especially selling masks , cosmetic etc. At night time you can try alot of local food as see in the pictures.  Beside that, there is also under pass shopping if happened rainning day you still can continue shop.  There are a lot of hotels surrounding, therefore it's convenient to book a hotel nearby. Subway station also just near the area easy to travel to other locations.  Bus station to airport also available in walking distance from nearby hotel.  Overall, a good area in Seoul."
647,5.0,"Lot's of sales, some streetfood and everything you would want to visit/have if you like k-beauty products. lot's of sale and famous korean brands for a lower price!"
648,5.0,"This is a long stretch of street market where you can find streetfood everywhere from seafood, meat, chips, strawberries, grilled food, etc. There are lots of skin care shops from Nature Republic, Missha, Tony Moly, Etude, etc and lots for shops for clothes, shoe and some souvenir items. The skin care shops offered lots of freebies and the prices are way cheaper as compared to prices of the same brand in shops here in the Philippines. If you dont like streetfood, there are also lots of restaurant. Good to try this place. We went here for 2 nights."
649,5.0,"A must visit place if you are planning to come to Seoul. Lot of choices of items from fashion, cosmetics, foods, Coffee shops and familiar brand like The North Face, Uniqlo, Daiso and very close to Myeongdong station. Plenty of guesthouse around and also close to Seoul Tower and Seoul Station. Friendly for english speaking travellers."
650,5.0,"I suggest you to stay in this area during your visit in Seoul. You can find food street at night, breakfast in the morning, good cafe, restaurants, fashion, cosmetic, hotel, and many mores. Everything you need as a traveler...even though you are a solo traveler. It has the atmosphere that makes me to return to this place again and again."
651,3.0,I was a bit disappointed in this area - there are heaps of shops around but for some reason this area didn't do much for me. There are some others with more atmosphere- Hondae for instance.
652,5.0,Love this street!  We stayed in a boutique hotel in the centre of this area. Worth visiting during the night when it is fully lit.  Definitely sample some of the street food on offer.
653,4.0,"Even though I hate crowded places I find myself going to Myeongdong quite often. That’s because I really like the big H&M and Forever21 stores there. Also, I guess there’s no better place if you want to buy a variety of korean cosmetics in one place. Plus, you can try many street food there.  What I don’t like about Myeongdong, except for the crowds, are people advertising their makeup store with giving you “free” masks or so.. Guys, these are no free unless you buy something from their store. And the other thing is that there’s really no good restaurant there."
654,5.0,"If you simply must go shopping in Seoul, this is the place to go! With all the stuff that Korea has to offer, you will find them here. Souvenirs, specialty shops, beauty products, Music Korea, Innisfree, etc. etc. you name it. What really sets this place off is during the late afternoons to evening when the food carts come in to give you a taste of Korean street foods. You can choose from a wide variety of preparation which is distinctly Korean. This truly should not be missed by anyone travelling to Seoul."
655,4.0,"My first day of Seoul, s Korea trip brought me from Incheon Airport to Seoul railway station. Next, after leaving my luggage at the hostel, I swiftly decided to see the Myeongdong shopping street! First impression, very long and lots of restaurants, clothing shops, and souvenir shops on there! Most well known brand such as Zara, HM, and Polo were all there, furthermore, I found Miniso the Japanese and Chinese bargain shop there too! Very nice! Lots of BBQ restaurants there too! Great place."
656,5.0,"Some of the sellers are a bit sweet/pushy for you to buy their merchandise, but nothing rude....they have a lot to offer. I did make a mistake and bought a letter opener, thank goodness they allowed it on the plane. It wasn't expensive so it would not of been a money loss just a souvenir loss. :-)"
657,4.0,Good place to shop for cosmetic products and savor some street foods. Transport is easy with a MRT station nearby.
658,5.0,"Myeongdong is a great area to visit. Great eats. Anything tried was delicious. Egg pancakes, fresh cut fruit, steak, fries banana, tornado potato. Street food at its best. Loads of shopping. Clothes, cosmetics, skincare, shoes. Visit the cathedral as well. There is a tourism office near the Myeongdong Theatre if you need to ask about city bus tours."
659,4.0,"great shops, bargains galore great for skin care, beauty care also with restaurants, street food to die for, hanging out to come back."
660,5.0,"Shopping in the cold is one experience i will probably remember as my wife and daughter enjoyed a lot and did not mind doing.. It made me sick though I may probably do it with more prepared proper clothing. Lots of interesting things to see, buy and eat. Be ready to burn your wallet."
661,5.0,"Best place to shop for cosmetics. Must visit if you go to Korea. They have a lot of discounts on different brands of cosmetics. Must visit. They have etude house shops which have good discounts. Also, the salespeople outside the shops will give you a lot of samples to try"
662,5.0,"good place to do shopping n food , all in 1 area myeongdong shopping market. crowded n nice environment too."
663,4.0,"I don’t know if I can say anything that hasn’t been said before about Myeongdong. If you aren’t into skin care, cosmetics, fashion and Korean interpretation of current trends, visit the place anyway to experience the crowds, sample street foods and pop into the cat/dog/ferret cafes in the area."
664,4.0,"A one-stop area for beauty products - Innisfree, Etude House, Olive Young, Missha, Nature Republic, Skin Food and many more. In the evening, there are many Street food stalls selling gimbap, BBQ meat, egg bread, grilled lobster with cheese, fish cake on skewers. There also other vendors selling socks, knock off designer bags and souvenirs. There are many nice cafes and restaurants along the streets."
665,4.0,"My friend a and I loved wandering the streets of Myeongdong. At night the food stalls provided the ideal opportunity the try lots of different things without spending a fortune! There’s lots of lovely outdoor bars, Korean BBQ restaurants and ‘chicken and beer’ places. Shopping is good too - Korean and American/European shops as well as places to buy souvenirs. Great fun!"
666,5.0,"Masks and cosmetic products sold here are way more cheaper than any other places in Korea, there's a lot of Buy1Free1 promotion going on. Loud hipster musics as background. Happening street which is full of all kinds of street foods. Love the oden with toppoki at the end of the road , beside the 7-11 store. Love the environment but people here might be alil pushy if you block their way."
667,5.0,"Shop til you drop, not kidding. You can stop and get a bite to eat at many restaurants and at street food vendors, and go back to more shopping. We simply loved every minute of it. So many cosmetic stores and you can spend hours there looking at so many different products. It's very reasonable there too. I bought a trench coat for only $45 and the best part is that it fits! I'm very short so most clothes need to be altered but not here in Korea. Most of the clothes were made for Asian women I think because they fit really well."
668,4.0,Myeondong shopping area is a great place to amble through day or night. The street food is amazing and incredibly good value for money.
669,5.0,Went to eat at Myeondong noodle restaurant three times. Serving is fast. Enjoyed the street food market at night and shopping with all the neon lights making the place well lighted and fun to walk around.
670,3.0,"You can count on a few things in Myeongdong-gil... - skincare stores with employees soliciting outside the store trying to give you a sample - stores and vendors selling knock-off designer bags and accessories - street vendors selling local eats - a ton of Korean restaurants - a ton of convenience stores  The downside is all the stores in each category seem to be selling the exact same stuff! It’s hard to distinguish one alleyway from the next because the stores are so redundant. There’s literally duplicates of branded stores as well.  All to say, Myeongdong-gil is a cool place to visit and shop but gets old after a while. Make sure you check out a Korean BBQ restaurant ...we really enjoyed them.  Strawberries dipped in syrup on a stick was a cool street vendor eat we enjoyed.  Check out different foods you find in convenience stores...they’re all good! Fishy ice cream sandwich below (not fish flavoured lol)"
671,5.0,"Busy small streets at night. Lots of small shops that sells everything from beauty products, electronic gadgets, and clothes. We went for the atmosphere. The shops facade are heavily decorated with neons and lights. Feels like you're in a manga."
672,4.0,"I enjoyed shopping here for 24K Gold, Caviar, and Snail ingredient skincare products. Most shops-Too Cool for School, Holika Holika, Missha, etc we’re having a sale, buy two get one free, etc. I did my research online first and if the shop sale was offering a better deal then online I snagged it. I didn’t care for the constant harassment grabbing my arms and hands to force me into entering certain skincare shops (Pink?, Skin Food, etc), but a very stern “NO” helped. I enjoyed Myeondong shopping and street food vendors; my favorite was hands down the grilled lobster tails with cheese. Definitely worth $15,000 won."
673,4.0,"We found this to be one of the better places to buy affordable skin care products like face masks, face lotions, etc. There’s also a lot of restaurants and knockoff clothing vendors. Fun to stroll around for gifts"
674,5.0,"Shop till drop! Lot of street food, shops and here you will find huge crowd. There are information people placed at random places if you need guide. You can buy souvenirs here which is cheaper. There are lot of junctions here and make sure u remember your source junction, you can be a bit confused."
675,4.0,"There is so much to see here. Especially the food is great! There are many shops too, mostly cosmetics stores."
676,4.0,"Just around the corner from Lotte department store and Lotte Hotel. Myeongdong shopping street is the most wellknown main shopping area in Seoul, especially for ladies, old and young. Mainly for fashion, lifestyle and beauty. There are many cafes, restaurants too. The most interesting attraction might be the very propular one on instagram : Stylenanda Hotel, so named but actually not a ""hotel"" to stay, but a shop selling cosmetics, fashion clothing with a cafe, all housed in several storeys designed like a hotel and spa. The design concept dominated in pink color is interesting enough to attract younger crowd to go in and browsing around, taking photos and selfies for their instagram posts. At night the whole street is turning into a night market, with food stalls selling all kinds of food, snacks and souvenirs."
677,4.0,"Lots of food and souvenir stalls, and high street shops. Bustle and hustle after 4pm. Be prepared to hunt for bins for your rubbish. We found some next to subway stairs."
678,3.0,Myeongdong is for girls and women. Yes there are some nice cafes and restaurants along this area but the amount of cosmetic and make up shops in myeongdong is insanely high. The clothes shops are also primarily for women.
679,4.0,"I felt this area was a kind of hybrid between the older style markets and modern shopping malls. It was primarily pedestrian access (but make no mistake, watch out for small trucks and motorcycles) and at times was very busy. Lots of food vendors of all types of street foods and most were very cheap. I had shrimp, crabs, and strawberries and all were good. The stores were more conventional brand names and there were a lot of them. It seemed popular for the younger crowd. When i went there were numerous tourism representatives eager to help. My overall impression was that it was very safe and friendly. Great place to try the street eats and maybe scope out a bargain."
680,5.0,"A must see!! Full of shops and street foods to try!!  This is what seoul is about! Cosmetics, food , masks, etc!"
681,2.0,"Nice street with almost only beauty stores with great products but beware if you are not korean or even asian you will not be treated with respect there ! We bought a lot of products and they wouldnt give us samples unless we ask for it and even when we did ask they would only give 1 small sample while they would give 10 to 20 samples (yes!) To asian people right next to us who spent half less.... Also when entering no one would come to help us, no hello, no goodbye.. Even if prices were good we did not feel welcomed there... Especially at Laneige (such a good reputation oversees but it was the worst, as well as Innisfree). Tony moly and etude house were a little more open to tourists."
682,5.0,"Definitely something not to miss while in Seoul. The street with the food sellers is amazingly full and interesting for someone who is not familiar with the Korean food, so this is good to see and then taste..."
683,5.0,This shopping street is a perfect shopping street for those who like to shop and eat at the same time without having to go any other places Can find a types of food and many cosmetics and skin care and some good brands

687,5.0,We visited this place on 16th of May 2019. This is one wild place to visit and I loved every second of it! There are some amazing shopping centres and a huge daiso shop with 5 floors!! I totally recommend shopping in this area if you get a chance to fly to Korea it’s a total experience to remember!
688,3.0,The street food is great. There's a lot of places to shop especially if you're in to K-Beauty. However I would skip this place if I don't have time. Myeongdong isn't that unique - there's plenty of shopping districts like this all over the world. Most of the shops are targeted for Chinese costumers and it's always overcrowded. If you like the atmosphere I recommend Insadong or Hongdae instead.
689,4.0,"This is one of the most popular shopping district in Korea for tourists. Many tourists come here to try the street food, and shopping. This area is famous for yummy street food, from the start of the station exit 8 or 9 all the way straight down to the shopping areas. You can eat, get a massage, see lots of cafe, and eat desserts here. You can rest, and shop as you go; because there are many cafes around. Go here for some food and shopping fun!!!"
690,5.0,"We stayed right next to this street, and found it a great place to explore at night. There are blocks upon blocks of streets to explore along this street. The streets are lined with vendors selling street food, socks, shoes, shirts, trinkets, jewelry, dresses, and almost anything else you can think of. On top of that, it is incredibly crowded with people stopping, pushing, bumping you, eating, and just having a good time. It was a lot of fun just exploring these streets and restaurants along the way."
691,5.0,Very vibrant area. Really liked the atmosphere even though I am not a big shopping fan. Went there every night of my stay in Seoul to try some new Korean street food. Some good traditional Korean restaurants can also be found in the side streets.
692,5.0,"you can settle everything there. foot massage is also available but did not try. full of cosmetic shops (10+10free) masks, sports wear, etc.. nice street stores available too. but you are in for a “fight” especially when there is a sales. and yes, plenty of halal foods for muslim tourists!"

There could be another same outlet on another street so be sure to check out the promotions before your purchase. Also, consolidate your purchases for higher tax refund/ rebate. The higher the amount, the higher the amount of tax refund.  Also check out the cafes such as the innisfree cafe."
697,5.0,"The street was crowded but clean. The shops were all kind. My friend got sleepy in the shop, and the they quickly came and asked if my friend’s conditions was ok or not. Very hearty experience"

Most historical sites are mostly walking distance or short cab ride away, and authentic Korean restaurants and entertainment venues are also nearby, lots of street foods at night. And every where you go there are always stores selling beauty products, I have never seen so many variations of facial mask until I came to this area, and these products are seems to be the best giveaways to your friends when you go back home..."
701,4.0,"Good for shopping especially for skincare, street food, cheap souvenirs and snacks! There are jewelry & sports boutiques too.. Can find almost everything but for fashion apparrel better to go to dongdaemun."

703,5.0,"Lots of things for shopping. You can find almost every brands here. Some cosmetic shop will let their staff to give you a free gift but you need to visit inside that shop. If you don’t want to visit or buy anything, better deny for that free gift."
704,4.0,"Very crowded in the evening. Good experience authentic smelling street food, that not experience in my home country. Lots of facial masks and facial cosmetics for ladies. Its a ladies world. Different mask products which is sold in discount packaging. Unless u know which product to buy, u will be totally confused. Average price between 1000 to 1500 won per mask. But if u buy like 10 + 10, the cost can be as low as 500 wong. Shop around and get the best price."
705,5.0,"A bustling shopping area that is filled with people looking for the right bargain that they are looking for.  If you love to try local / street food this is definitely one of the best places to visit. The variety of street food will surely sate your tummy. From your typical hotdog on a stick, to something more exotic like flame grilled lobsters and oysters.  As for shopping, you definitely will find great deals from mobile phone cases, bags, tshirts, pants, and most important of all COSMETICS!"
706,5.0,"Perhaps one of the coolest places to visit in Seoul at night. There are tons of stores too (I skipped those), and some great restaurant options. A short walk from the city center."
707,5.0,"Had a lot of fun shopping, especially at all the K-Beauty stores. It was a really miserable day to go sightseeing, but a perfect day to go shopping. The streets did not disappoint!"

709,5.0,"If you love Korean skincare or beauty products, here is the best place to go look and spend your money on it. Cheaper than in your country, all the face mask, night cream, or whatever.  Not just one store, but almost all brands are here. Plus, if you start to get hungry, there are a lot of Korean food street here. The price is a bit higher than in other places in Seoul (street food) because Myeon dong has more international tourist than other places. Maybe that's why they put a higher price, but the taste and quality are the same. Just pick the most crowded food stall, they probably sell a tastier one than the other.  Most hotel/hostel in Myeondong also have a higher price, I always booked into a different area and go to Myeon-dong via subway. Cheaper and faster.  You might want to bring a small suitcase to buy a year worth of face mask here. Lol!"

712,4.0,"Myeongdong has everything you will need and want when in Seoul. Food, fashion, beauty all in one area of streets and alleys filled with stores, hawkers, stalls and even plastic surgery clinics. It's not uncommon for people fresh from the doctor to walk around with their faces swathed in bandages, buying street food at a stall. Just a normal sight in Myeongdong folks. The place is bright and flashy and filled with people. You can fill your stomach with food from the different hawkers stalls selling cheap, clean food. And the portions are pretty big too. Each alley has so many buildings stuck together side by side and each building has has at least one establishment per floor. So don't just look at the ground floor shops, look up and you'll discover that there's so much more to Myeongdong than you thought there was. You can stop and take photos of everything and people don't mind. Do go into the cosmetics shops and try their masks and beauty potions. Don't forget, take advantage of the promos and keep your receipts for the tax refunds at the airport. And make sure you get your gifts with purchase, they give lots of samples of their products. Take note that many stores will have multiple outlets in Myeongdong. Don't worry, it's ok to get lost since you'll eventually find your way again albeit with more shopping bags in your hands before you do."
713,4.0,"Don't eat a full meal before you come here in the evening! Tons of street food, desserts, and fruit juice stands! There's lots of weird desserts, and delicious street food to experience, the street is misleading as it is more like a whole multiblock shopping area. The area is busy throughout the day, but in the evning, the street vendors come out and start work. Good place to buy gifts and various beauty products as well."
714,5.0,"Shopping street till late night with lots of foods, fashion and skin products! From Myeongdong metro station exit 7. Just across the road is Lotte Mall & Young Lotte."
715,5.0,"We explored Myeongdong Shopping Street late in the night after dinner at a nearby bulgogi restaurant. The weather was freezing in January, but one of the best things about this was the piping hot street food from the stalls lined up along the street. There was this stall serving fresh giant scallops off the shell, the guy would scoop the scallop out of the tank, shuck it, pop on a generous topping of cheese, and then blowtorch the lot into a gooey, bubbling pile of scallop and cheese, eaten straight off the shell standing on the street in -3C cold."
716,5.0,"Streets and alleys lined up with face products from the well known and some i only encountered here. If you buy alot of stuff they're supposed to give you samples and i mean samples... That was like only 2 years ago. Now, they'd just give like 3 or something for 65k won. If you feel hungry, don't fret... You wouldn't feel hungry as you would get a chance to eat and drink to your stomach's content. From baked milk, noodles, kimchi, gelato and sausages... I tried the noodles and the sausages... Noodles were great. Sausages have different flavours sticked altogether. All was doing well until I tasted curry at the 4th sausage and that was it for the sausage... I cant take the curry."
717,5.0,I know most people come here for the shopping but my favorite part is all the street food. It's a fun lively area with a huge number of reasonable shops -- not the fancy fancy type.
718,5.0,"I used to stay in Myeongdong during my business trips for doing some shopping in the evenings. This place is a must visit for people who like shopping. There are so many stores with a wide variety of clothes, cosmetics on display. This place is mostly frequented by the Japanese tourists so there are many sushi joints also nearby."
719,4.0,"A little expensive for regular shopping, since it's all about the known stores and brands. But it's a cool place to get high quality products, and definitely a good place to eat. You'll find all sort of restaurants and cafes, so be sure to go through all the streets and alleys, you won't be disappointed. Recommended: Cat cafe, Hello Kitty Cafe, Korean BBQ, etc."
720,4.0,"A lot of my visitors to Korea are pulled like a magnet towards Myeongdong, swayed by the tales of cosmetic freebies. Sometimes I manage to talk them down, but mostly they ignore the plain facts that the kinds of stores found there are on any high street in Korea and they all hand out freebies. It is also bizarrely famous for its restaurants, but if your scale of quality lends itself to overpriced, over-cooked, over-fancy, then you are definitely in the right place."
721,5.0,"Definitely great place for shopping till 11pm. Also, there are a lot of food and beverage variety in the area."
722,4.0,"I went with three adult female friends in search of ""Forever 21."" We were treated instead to a variety of yummy Korean street food typical to Winter. My personal favorites were gyeranbbang (egg bread/cake) and hotteok (pancakes). And to various street vendors for scarves, gloves, beanies/hats to deal with the freezing temperature. In addition to the multiple clothing stores, cafes, and beauty product stores, there is an underground flea market style shopping center accessible by an exit from the subway."
723,4.0,"If you dont mind mob like crowds (lol) then go on! Busy during day, busier at night! This area has all the major international household brands like Zara, h&m, etc. if your looking for cosmetics.. Then look no further. Restaurants are a plenty but you need to look up as most restaurants are above ground level. Many boutiques as well but not cheap. For the same ""Korean"" (meaning not brand) merchandise better go to Edae (Ehwa women's university) where you can find similar items at least 20-30% cheaper."
724,5.0,"I just love myeongdong ❤ you can find everything here. Foods, makeups, bags, and even cute oppars. (:"
725,3.0,"Myeongdong is alive at night. Bright lights coupled with street full of shoppers are a common sight. There are street hawkers which add on to the shopping experience.  However, shopping can get a bit boring when all the shops are selling the same products on a different brand name. It is not uncommon that the same brand is operating on different alley in Myeongdong.  I think it's a good experience to visit Myeongong to complete your skincare shopping list and satisfy your hunger."
726,4.0,The streets food are really capturing my nose as I walk through the junctions and buildings. But as a moslem I cannot simply bought things which is doubtfull of the halal status. Suddenly.....when my wife are look a kids shoe at some corner I saw a moslem man selling grill squid on a stall..the price of a stick of grill squid is krw3000. I bought 3 stick and enjoy it well. The location Is if you walk from the post office/7 eleven go straight untill the last 2 left junction with shops. Go down and the stall is on the right side.
727,4.0,Walking the streets of Myeondong is great fun. A mixture of department stores & street market. All the streets are packed day & night with shopping opportunities. At night it turns into a street stall with food & clothing stalls all around the area & goes until around 10pm
728,5.0,"An awesome shopping spot. Etude, Nature Republic, The Saem, Lush, Urban Dollkiss, Hello Kitty Cafe, Wonderbra, etc etc! You name it, this shopping street will probably have it. On one of the end of the shopping street is right across Lotte Mall (there's also the duty-free mall!).  Most of the stuff you buy at shops here is tax-refundable (look for stickers outside the shop, I forgot what they were called but they have tax something written on it), but refund them if you have a morning or probably very late night flight, since the queues can be VERY long, my mom has said. We had a morning flight so it had just opened and only had one or two people queueing.  IF: You are buying stuff for yourself, then please do so accordingly. However, IF you are planning to buy gifts for others, I suggest buying stuff at the nearby Lotte Duty Free mall. You pay cheaper for buying in bulk, basically. Buy the Korean brands though! If you buy the imported ones at the duty free mall, you'd have to pick them up at the airport (which can be a hassle). I went crazy with all the cosmetics around--- I wished my makeup stock was low so I could buy more stuff without feeling too much guilt hehe!!!  Food: There are lots of food stalls in the middle of the road, but there are less amount of stalls during the day. There are also restaurants and snack shops available.  Short on cash? Worry not! They have banks somewhere in the middle where you can get money out of the ATM from. I stayed at Sejong Hotel so the nearest was a Woori Bank.  Language: Many of them speak Mandarin Chinese instead of English (some of them are actually even from Mainland China), so if you don't speak Korean but speak Mandarin, that's a plus. Hoards of tourists from China often come here to shop, so many of them are trained to be fluent in Chinese.  In restaurants, they usually do not accept gratuities. My mom once offered tips but they refused.  All in all, just prepare to shop and spend lots of cash :') here, the shops are not haggle-able, but is tax-refundable (above 30k Won)."
729,3.0,"way too many mainland China vistors, the tourist speak mandarin, the store promote in mandrain, and even the salesperson are also Chinese."
730,5.0,"this is the shopping mecca of korea, you name it you will find it here at myeongdong, one stop shopping for everybody. not only fashion will you get here, food too, lot and lots of street food vendor serving various different delicacies u never imagine in your wildest dreams, when in korea do not forget to visit myeongdong."
731,5.0,"Heaven for all makeup/skincare lovers! Etude House, Aritaum, TonyMoly, Laneige/Iope/Mamonde flagship stores, Nature Republic, Skinfood, you name it, you got it. The sales assistants will lure you to enter their stores by giving freebies (sheet masks usually). I get more freebies than actual products by shopping in Myeongdong (for some reason I get less freebies in other areas such as Insadong or Dongdaemun). The area is just massive! There are more than one store for each brand so be sure to walk around as they have different discounts or offers in different outlets. I highly recommend for you to try the shaved ice in O'Sulloc and Sulbing. Money exchangers near Chinese Embassy have good rates."
732,4.0,"All the major brands are consolidated here. Crowded shopping area which is good for beauty products but the salespeople (especially those from China) are extremely pushy.  Every beauty shop has salespeople handing out small samples sachets but if you don't buy anything, they will take it back so don't bother. If you do buy, ask for more free samples, which they will give.  Go to Seoul Global Cultural Centre @ M PLAZA, level 5 to get a map of the area and try out the traditional costumes for free. There is also a good cooking school - Seoul Kimchi Academy House, located next to M Plaza.  For Hello Kitty fans, there is a cafe located at 100 – 810, 28, Myeongdong 4-gil, Jung-gu but I would strong recommend visiting the one at Hongdae which is bigger and prettier.  Lots of good restaurants in this area too. Look out for the street stalls that come out after 4pm."
733,3.0,"Can be a sea of people shopping all sorts of things there. Mainly beauty products. I initially did not quite understand the concept of having multiple outlets of the same brand in one area but I think it is because the area is just too busy you may have passed the outlet you intended to visit to purchase your facial and cosmetics. When there are more in the same area, you don't have to worry having to make a u turn. Unless you are familiar with the area you wouldn't or can't go back to where you were from and all you can do is move forward. While at it maybe you can visit the Myeongdong Catholic Cathedral ."
734,4.0,"Similar to Mongkok in Hong Kong. If you can only speak English, it may be difficult to go around MD. The staff in the shops or Resturants except us speak mandarin."
735,5.0,"This is a fun place to be for tourists whether it be day or night but at night the lights of the street really stand out. It's totally happening - lots of food carts, stores, and people. This is a MUST-DO when you come to Seoul."
736,5.0,"Its a galore in here! With beauty products costing about half the price you pay in Singapore, you have to come here! From Laneige to Tony Moly, you could get these famous Korean brands here. Its a pretty big shopping area for beauty products and clothes(although more clothes choices at Dong Dae Mun), hence prepare to spend more than 3 hours here if you are a shopaholic.  A little tip for tourists, if you wish to get immediate tax refund, purchase your beauty products at Lotte Duty Free, just flash your passport and you get the tax-free price."
737,4.0,"Many many shops selling different products, with many restaurants and most importantly, currency exchange shops offering good rates."
738,2.0,"I strolled through this district one evening and found it both overwhelming and disappointing. The streets were packed with shoppers carrying multiple shopping bags. The stores looked like typical chain stores of youthful fashion in the US. Every other store seemed to be a cosmetic store with aggressive sales ladies hawking beauty products at the door. If your idea of a cultural experience is walking through a gigantic outdoor shopping mall then rock on. Otherwise, I'd skip this and seek out other areas of the city with more pleasant experiences. I did find some very nice things in little shops in the Bukchon historic district - which is a very nice place to wander."
739,2.0,"Great place to shop but be aware that there will be a lot of tourists especially from other parts of Asia. Every time I've been to anywhere near or even in Myeongdong, including the duty free, I have been pushed and shouldered way too many times so I avoid this place as much as I can."
740,5.0,A must visit place at Seoul if you like cheap shopping... The streets are filled with varieties of commodities at a very cheap price... But there's a great scope of negotiating as none of the products are fixed priced... The place is just by the subway station...
741,5.0,"We went here at night just for the street food, the atmosphere is buzzing and you can sample many foods or just shop if that is what you fancy...."
742,4.0,"Myeongdong is good for buying korean cosmetics and young fashions. BUt, what we enjoyed most was the foc experience in imperial costume with a simulated ( green screen) background- at the KEB in Myeongdong."
743,5.0,"Never miss Myeondong when you visit Seoul. Plenty of branded stores such as H&M, zara etc. in one area plus night market. Restaurants are also around the area with diverse cuisine such as Japanese, Korean, chinese and American."
744,5.0,"You'll find everything here, especially the Korean brands, sumptuous Korean food. I especially love the street foods, yay! The goods, souvenirs & all can be bought in a very affordable price. :)"
745,4.0,"We enjoyed our visit to Myeongdong shopping district. I am used to the crowds in Hong Kong, and so wasn't fazed by the lesser crowds here, above or below ground. We found the whole area very clean, despite the crowds and all the little cooking stalls in the lanes, there was no food debris, no oil stain, no paper litter, anywhere on the ground. We were a bit mystified how street pedlars could cook in the middle of the lanes, to find electricity wires neatly bundled alongside the stalls. We had to carry our used boxes for blocks before we could find a rubbish bin, and in the end were happy to give them to an elderly man obviously collecting cardboard paper. Shopping was fun to look around, and see what is available, and how they compare with home. There was so much cosmetics and ladies wear. What do guys buy? We bought some 'snail' face masks, and something called 'cc cream"" without intending to, because of the special deals and discounts on offer. And we had afternoon tea with strawberry cakes and coffee. Very civilised. I didn't see any of the bad temper that others wrote about. The sales staff were all polite and anxious to please, and we had no difficulty walking away without purchasing, even after my hand was exfoliated, cleaned, lubricated, and nourished to the nth degree. We were surprised that the major second language used by sales staff was Mandarin, and that so many of them are from China! So while we can't speak a word of Korean, we had a very successful shopping expedition using Mandarin. And I forgot to mention the ubiquitous Korean ginseng products, and all the 'special' prices and deals we were offered. The prospect of getting tax refunds at the airport made the deals even sweeter as we did mental arithmetics to work out the actual costs. It was a successful and fun shopping day although we didn't buy all that much. I am sorry that other reviewers didn't enjoy it as much as we did."
746,5.0,"Just love this shopping area! Has a modern, fun-filled feel to it with tons of cafes, clothing and accessory shops, street food, etc. As the day goes on, more street vendors also set up so that by night it's almost hard to walk through the streets, but they have some awesome products and deals. You will find that about 1/4th of the stores sell cosmetic products and they have girls outside trying to lure you in with free face mask handouts.  We purchased many clothing items here for about $10 USD each. They were super cute and things we can't find here. Also tons of cute sock stores for $1 a pair. You can find more high end stores here as well, but that isn't what we were looking for.  As a bonus, the Myeongdong subway station (underground) is also a fairly good sized mall with lots of great little stores selling inexpensive merchandise. If you, by chance, are looking for KPOP related items, the store underground near exits 6, 7 and 8 had the best prices we found in the city. Most albums only $10 and lots of cute other accessories for $1-5 each."
747,4.0,Such a great place to shop! A variety of local and international brands at great bargains!  The sales promoters who stand outside the skincare shops who give out samples are pretty aggressive though. They put samples in my hands but I didn't enter the shop and just walked on and she chased me and snatched the sample out of my hand. I guess you have to at least go in if you want to keep the samples.
748,3.0,"As a hyper shopping district, the place was very industrialised and almost too touristy. Everyone was screaming towards you, prices are all raised and its crowded all the time. Its one of those places that you only need to see once and you never want to go back again."
749,3.0,"Myeongdong is jam-packed with shops which sell trendy fashion, cosmetics and skincare products. I am not particularly interested in those products in Korea. I saw lots of people walking around at night. It was noisy at night because there were so many people around and the K-pop music from the clothing stores there. I was more interested in the street food displayed by the food vendors which come out at night. You should go to Myeongdong with an empty stomach. No need to worry about that you may not have enough Korean won as there are a lot of foreign currency exchange shops."
750,5.0,OMG. It's an amazing place for shopping and food. Shop till you drop ... it's such a great place to be
751,4.0,"There are a lot of souvenir items to buy in this place but of course its frequented by many tourist so the price is also higher if you shop at other places in Seoul. However, if your just looking for a place to experience the korean vibe, spending a day in this place is totally worth it."
752,5.0,"We went there during the Korea Grand Sale so the prices were slash with big discounts. They also give free samples. At night, there are lots of street food you can try. The Korea Grand Sale usually happens during winter Dec-Feb so if you plan to do lots of shopping, go to Seoul during this time."
753,5.0,"I went to Myeonhdong to shopping with my cousin. All things were attractive us. We have planned to buy only skincare and cosmetic. But now if we go back,it will be not for skincare and cosmetic we will go for street food. It is fantastic you should try roast squid and something like strawberry in mochi."
754,3.0,"This place has a large number of cosmetics stores and clothes shops, as well as foreign clothing stores like H&M. Although it is very touristy and the sellers over charge you for street food and are pretty rude. If you like branded stuff this is your place."
755,5.0,"If you ever need a place to go crazy, here it is. Huge area with countless of shops for all your needs - beauty shops for all your masks and lotions, clothes, handphone accessories, amazing street foods, theater, restaurants and coffee cafes, bakeries, cute Korean stuffs and much more. Don't forget to check out Daiso for cheap finds and souvenirs."
756,5.0,"I love the place and everything about it. Full of good vibes that will make you come back more than once. You'll find cosmetic shops in every nook and cranny selling some of the finest and best cosmetic in Korea. My family and I went there during the weekend and the main street was filled with vendors selling all kinds of delicious street food and one of our favourite was the Strawberry Mochi which was 2500₩ each. Myeongdong is definitely the place to go if you feel the need to spend or even splurge as they have many designer stores. Besides, you can also do your tax refund here as they have a counter inside Woori Bank. And who knows you might even spot one or two Korean artistes around here."
757,4.0,"Lots of shops selling facial products, lots of street food at night. If you are after clothes, try Lotte Young Plaza. Enjoyed noodles and dumplings at Myeongdong Gyoza. Cheap and good."
758,4.0,A pretty nice place to walk and shop. There's some really nice street food in this area that deserves a second helping.
759,3.0,"Myeongdong is one of Seoul's shopping Meccas, maybe the most famous one. It feels European-ish, with its wide pedestrian streets and brand stores (rather than malls with a multitude of stores). It probably has everything you could hope for and then some. If you're interested in cosmetics (that wasn't my case), this might be the best place on Earth for that. However, I'd say that the area lacks lasting impression and soul. Architecturally and stylistically, Gangnam is more impressive. It also doesn't have a great nightlife nor many great restaurants. Finally, Myeongdong, although great for shopping, doesn't offer the same mix of authenticity, cultural significance, or architectural attraction as many of the areas around it. Clockwise: Insadong (great for traditional cultural experience), Dongdaemun (also great for shopping, but offers both a traditional market and the brand new DDP), Sogongdong (with the Seoul City Hall and the DeokSuGoong Palace, the true heart of the city), Jongno (skyscrapers, CheongGyeCheong, GwangHwaMun). So, if you like shopping, definitely go to MyeongDong, but in any case, don't miss all the districts surrounding MyeongDong that may be even more interesting."
760,2.0,"they insist to give your samples. when you take the one, they will grap your hands and pull to their shops. when you refuse to go inside, they will get back your samples in a very rude mannner :("
761,3.0,"You will never find an area with so much cosmetics boutique so this is a must visit. However, it is more cost-effective to purchase at the airport as the airport duty-free has most of the items (it's only tax-refund at Myeongdong so it's not as cheap as the airport)."
762,5.0,"Definitely the place you should go if you want to shop. You can find several korean clothing brands, and of course loads of korean cosmetic stores. Also easy to find restaurants and very easy to get there cuz im close to the subway station. I think night time is a pleasant period to go there."
763,4.0,"everything here cost twice than real price , all shop owners know that you are tourist so price is double , don't spent your money here just visit and have fun with great atmosphere ."
764,4.0,WOW! myeongdong! it's very electric here! one will get very excited with the shops and the peeps roaming around. approach the tourist info officer and get a map or just roam the streets and alleys and enjoy! buy from beauty stores and get lots of freebies
765,5.0,Looking for Korean make up brand? you come to the right place.. or looking for street foods?? yes you are here!! even dinner at one of the restaurants here? you can't be wronged! I love Myeongdong...
766,1.0,"My daughters and I were in the vicinity of Myeongdong when we went for the NANTA show. It was full of people, roadside stalls that have repeated goods throughout and the many many cosmetic shops which sells the same stuff. And the same brand of cosmetic shop repeats themselves every block and round the corners. Their 50% sticker on their window probably refers to the masks in packs and a few items only in the shops.  Anyway, some of the roadside vendors are rude. One of them actually told us ' palli ka ' ( which means quickly go ) with a wave of her hand when we said thank you but we are not taking that pair of jeans. We were only looking at it and asked about the price, not even haggling one bit. My daughter and I couldn't believe our ears!  Anyway, the skincare / cosmetics we saw there could be bought elsewhere which is quieter with less people pushing you around with the same discounts too....  But I must say that the eateries are in abundance and a wide range of choice."
767,5.0,"This place might seem a bit overwhelming and perhaps even intimidating when you get out of the metro and see thousands of people running around searching for that special item of make up, clothes, shoes, bags or street food.  In reality you just need to take a deep breath, look around, locate the main stores that are closest to you and slowly but surely make your way to them. Whatever you are after, you will find it here. Korean or international clothing lines, lots and lots of makeup: I highly recommend you try Korean brands. They are very affordable and very good quality, lots of stuff is actually organic, and you will never find organic make up, creams and what not cheaper than here. Every time you enter the store, they will give you free samples of hand creams, face wipes etc, and it doesn't matter whether you are actually going to buy something or not. Beware that lots of creams and lotions are whitening, so if you cherish your tan, stay away from those.  The centre of the streets is usually occupied by the locals selling wonderful (and of course unhealthy) street food you should definitely try. The queues are impressive but move very quickly.  It is easy to get lost as the place is usually packed, so make sure you set a meeting point in case you lose sight of each other in the crowd.  There are all sorts of attractions like NANTA Theatre, N Tower Cultural Centre etc all withing walking distance from this area, so there is always something to do.  The restaurants in this area are admittedly a bit pricey, so for food I would go somewhere else."
768,4.0,"so much fun , i went several times, This area has a lot of shops, many major names, and a fair assortment of smaller ""boutique"" Plenty of cosmetics shops for the ladies to feast, so ladies “Shop Till You Drop for the Ladies” .  the only thing i dont like is how in your space are the sales associate"
769,5.0,"Great deals at H&M with US sizes and trends. I believe there are two locations at the Myeondong Station.  Tired of Shopping? Have lunch at anyone of the numerous eateries that include California Pizza Kitchen, Outback Steakhouse, TGIFridays and many others."
770,2.0,"If you are a shopaholic you may never go home. It is easy to get to, clerks speak English and the prices not too outrageous. I bought a shirt there on Tuesday at 3:00 PM for 30,000 and bought the same shirt at Dongdaumun on the same day at 11:30 PM for 18,000."
771,5.0,"If you have tons of spending money, here's the place to burn it. Three story H&M? Check. Five Etude Houses on the same block? Check. More shoe stores than you can possibly visit in one day? Check.  It is unbearable on weekends, so try to go during the week or early in the morning.  If you're lucky, you'll see the ""666 You're Going to Hell"" guys walking around with giant signboards.  Lots of restaurants, lots of tourists. If you go underground, there are lots of cheap shoes, bags, and accessories.  Namdaemun market isn't too far away if your prefer something traditional, but expect to haggle and perhaps pay a ""foreigner tax"" there."
772,3.0,Myeongdong used to have a variety of shops...now mostly cosmetic shops selling '24K Snail Cream'! Side streets still have interesting small shops selling locally designed and manufactured goods. Way too crowded at night and stores such as H&M have taken away the 'local' flavor that was once Myeongdong.
773,5.0,"In this shopping streets (hundrets of building) you can find almost everything you need and not need. You can find here all kinds of textiles, tools, animals, foods, simply a real whole sale market. As here also koreans buy their stuff, please don't be afraid of body contacts. Here is everybody pushing everybody. That is Asian peoples cuture. Also you should not negotiate too much in here, as the prices are quite low and the Koreans are not cheating foreigners like in many other countries. So i wish you a good experience and enjoy the time here."
774,4.0,"Myeongdong is a hotbed for the young and chic, with plenty of bars and clubs, and European-style cafés, as well as a multitude of shopping outlets for major international brands. It is probably the ultimate hang-out place in Seoul – and luckily my hotel was right on its doorstep!  Myeongdong as a location is fantastic. On every corner there are quaint cafés and eateries, as well as lively bars with loud music. At night this is especially prevalent. Although I did not seem to take any photos, I can assure you that street food is very popular in Myeongdong as well. The sights, sounds, and smells all contribute to an amazing shopping experience walking through this part of Seoul, be it during the day or in the evening.  I have travelled to Ximending in Taipei, Bukit Bintang in Kuala Lumpur, TST in Hong Kong, Shinjuku in Tokyo, but I think none of them were as immersive and as impressive as Myeongdong. Give yourself a whole day here to explore the nooks and crannies - and that includes a meal or two, seeing as you'll be there most of the day anyway!"
775,4.0,"My hotel was right across this shopping area on steroids so I was able to see and compare Myeongdong in the morning, afternoon and on a Sunday night. My first visit was Sunday night and it was like a street party, seems like everyone was out and about even though it was a cool spring night, you can shop or you can people watch. Koreans, tourist alike and with loud music blaring from stores until late at night will get you in the party mood, if not the buying mood. There are a lit of beauty product stores, sometimes the same store on different streets. Etude, Innisfree, Tony Moly, The Face Shop, Laneige..just to name a few. Also some stores like Artbox selling cute stuff to take home, lots of stalls selling socks with Kpop idols face on them. I kinda hung around and just checked out the stores first and came back the next day since I already knew what I wanted to get. The vibe was great but I preferred Insadong for the more artsy, handmade and unique souvenirs."
776,5.0,"Myeongdong is a huge pedestrian marketplace with tons of shopping in the heart of Seoul. The stores and restaurants are plentiful, and they are all near all of the other shopping centers in Seoul. They have more nicer stores that you would see in America. I highly recommend checking this place out!"
777,3.0,"This is the place to go if you want to shop for everything ranging from beauty products (skin food etc), to Zara and Uniglo, and everything in between.  You should visit both in the daytime and at night, as there are different vibes. Also, from early evening onwards, there are tons of street stalls serving pancakes, ice cream and various other offerings.  For diners, you have a wide choice, including Korean bbq restaurants, American fastfood and Turkish kebabs.  Definitely a must visit when in Seoul."
778,5.0,"Great and convenient location. Near Lotte Department store and Lotte Young Plaza. There are plenty of Korean brand skincare shops! Olive Young is the best! Everything under 1 roof - bought lots of skincare, food, hair products etc. Awesome place to shop for everything at Myeongdong! Zara and H&M and even Club Monaco are here. Highly recommended!"
779,2.0,"Nice street for tourists. Nothing special, you can find almost everything in China or USA, and everything is higher priced than in the states."
780,5.0,I could have spent all night walking up and down the main road in Myeongdong. I love the electric feeling you get surrounded by all of those people. It was crowded but not too crowded like Times Square. A MUST DO when you are in Seoul.
781,5.0,"Excellent place with tons of shops for my wife (cosmetics) and places to eat (must try the street food). Do try the Tornado Potato and tentacles of fried and dried octopus and squid. They really are some of the most delightfully flavorful and pleasingly textural item from the sea. West of Myeongdong is the Namdaemunmarket market after passing the Shinegae department store (10 mins walk), heading East is the Myeongdong Cathedral (enter through the Myeongdong-gil and up the hill). Best way to arrive at Myeongdong is my metro, get out of Myeong-dong station using exit 6 or 8 and head north."
782,4.0,"I stayed in Myeongdong and certainly did a lot of shopping there. It is fantastic for free samples and the competition between the stores is huge so often there are sales. The late night shopping is also great too, everything is normally closed by 10pm and the shops are only open late on some nights. Check out my blog post on my time there. http://rememberthefirst.wordpress.com/2013/07/14/myeongdong-명동-seoul-south-korea-what-to-do-a-review/"
783,5.0,"Shopping, shopping, shopping + restaurants. Heaven for those who like to shop. Very crowded, but for a reason. Full of Asian shopping at the cosmetics stores. Great deals and discounts for all kinds of shopping whether it is Korean and Western shoe stores, clothes or cosmetic stores. There are at least 2 H&M's which I shopped at. Love all the body shops such as Face Shop, Holika Holika, Skin, Skin Food, Tony Molly, Aritaum etc. You should definitely visit for some great deals and wonders for your body and skin. Lots of great restaurants with local Korean food, Chinese, Japanese, and Western. Lots of street food ranging from local snacks to Turkish Wraps, to sweets, to fruit. A few hotels within the Myeongdong Shopping area. Currently staying at J Hill hotel. I really, really enjoy coming back to Myeondong whenever I'm in Seoul."
784,4.0,"I love Myeongdong.. its cosmetics heaven, and i just like seating outdoor and people watch. almost all young people are there. You can see a glimpse of Seoul Life in Myeongdond, although its always crowded."
785,5.0,"This is the place that i would like to return in Seoul, for shopping and having meals. Since there's a lot of cosmetic shops in here, so you can compare and choose whatever cosmetic you like in short distance. There are various types of restaurant, and street foods."
786,4.0,"A lot of shops, young people, good vibration, also find something to take with you or to eat , easy to get there by subway..."
787,5.0,Very fashionable... full of beauty products. Try the local brands as it is cheaper than the imported brands like body shop which is priced the same in Manila. Has a lot of bargains but signs showing a 50 off is only for members. Etude gives a 30% discount to tourists. There is a coach outlet in one alley that is priced cheaper than hongkong.
788,5.0,truly a memorable shopping experience for me when i visited this place during winter. It's located nearby to dongdaemon market the other shopping haven. As a lady who love to shop for items like handbags & skincare products for very reasonable price this is the right place to be!
789,5.0,Fantastic for females. So many cheap shops selling everything a woman could need. Endless beauty shops. Also great if you're a K-pop fan as there are many K-pop stores selling everything from CD's to mugs. Very busy but still able to look around. Lotte store and Lotte Young Plaza are also here and well worth a look.
790,4.0,"I liked the night market,it is the place to buy cosmetics and clothes. Seaweed is cheap there, too. But dislike to be ther during summer"
791,5.0,We visited this place almost every single day during our stay in Korea as our guesthouse was just a 5 min walk from here. And we never get sick of this place! There are just so so many places to shop I don't think we actually covered the entire place even though we went for many days. xD Very tourist friendly as most of the salespersons switched languages the moment they realise we couldn't understand Korean. You can get almost anything from food to clothes to cosmetics to bags here..anything you can name!:D You can probably get a map if you want to navigate around though..many streets were rather similar and there were several times when we walked to the same place over and over again..xD
792,3.0,"Myeongdong is highly recommended for those who love cosmetics, as there are plenty shops selling cosmetic products.  It is a outdoor shopping, and you may not like it if it is raining.  There are plenty of cloth there, price range around 10000won., if u r looking for low price cloth, i would recommend Gangnam express terminal underground shopping mall, as the price range around 5000 won."
793,5.0,"Shopper's paradise. From facial products, to food, to phone accessories, clothes, I even had a Korean stamp made from my name in Korean characters from a little shop. Food aplenty, take your pick from the various restaurants here. Fast food, many Starbucks (for the avid tumbler collectors), street food (open faced egg sandwiches, sausages, toasted octopus etc). It's really a haven for shoppers and every nook and cranny has a shop that you must walk into. AWESOME for shopping, spend at least a day here, go during the day and and also at night :)"
794,2.0,"They are too pushy and really scary. One of them grabbed my arm and was talking don't know what to me... I assumed she was asking me to take the sample and buy stuff in the store. Some of them were really rude. There was one girl who snatched my cousin's sample as she exited the store because she didn't buy anything from them.  Service and friendliness is so different from 2 or 3 years ago. They use to flood us with samples but not anymore. They don't even give us any if we buy below a certain amount. Very disappointed with the cosmetics stores.  Clothes and accessories shopping is different. They are not pushy and are nice. Prices are the same as at Dongdaemun, so don't bother going elsewhere to shop for nice and cheap stuff."
795,4.0,"To go to myeongdong is to shop.it is blocks(small ones) and blocks of shops and restaurants all packed together. Cosmetic shops, brand name clothing shops-h&m,unipolar,f21,Lacoste,etc., Korean restaurants,coffee shops(cafe bene,etc). The streets also gets packed with street food carts and carts selling all kinds of stuff-scarves,socks, shirts, bags,pants,etc.-as the day goes on.but, everything is still very organized,safe, and orderly. Their homegrown cosmetic/skin are shops like nature republic, étude,baviphat,etc greets you in almost every block. The promotions in each of these shops differ, one may be slashing their prices on some items ,but, when you reach their other outlets,prices may not be slashed.prices are good and the quality of Korean skincare and haircare products are really good ,too. The various restaurants are also good.it is better to dine in a proper restaurant than fill yourself with street food(where a stick of sausages would set you back by 3000won).you can get a decent restaurant meal starting at 6000won. Would recommend myeongdong for a spot of retail therapy.haggling is not the norm here..if you want to haggle, then, dongdaemon should be your stop."
796,5.0,Here is shopping heaven to the gals! You will see the promoters all shouting and ask you to visit their shops. They will also give you free samples in order to attract you to stop and go in :) but it's definitely no regret to step in the shops! So much of choices and CHEAPPP!!
797,4.0,"You can literally buy anything here. The area is huge that the first stop is the accessories and the next is the fashion area. If you like to shop, then this is the place for you. Souvenir items, k-pop, k-drama or hallyu souvenirs are all in these areas. Bring extra luggage coz you'll need it :)"
798,4.0,"This place is huge and crowded, even during the winter. There is tons of shopping, entertainment, and food. It's fun to walk around to all of the food vendors and try everything out, especially if you are a foreigner. It will take you most of a day to navigate around this area because there is so much to do and see. I think it's a must for anyone vacationing in Seoul."
799,4.0,"We didn't buy a thing while here but enjoyed looking at the huge crowds, display windows of the fancy and typical stores, interesting street vendors. There was even a CAT CAFE!!! VERY busy! Also very photogenic!"
800,3.0,"Good for ppl who want to do shopping for everything at one place, especially cosmetics, they have The Face Shop, Nature Republics, It's Skin, etcs. are all there, and you could even find the same brand has more than 3 shops on the same road, and also some other Japanese shops(full of Japanese customers...). Honestly i think it's quite similar to Busan shopping street, and all shopping centers in the world, shops are on 2 sides of road next to each other, the path is narrow, coffee shops and Lotteria fast food rest. could be found there also. people are everywhere by weekends. apart from cosmetics,they also sell little stuff, gifts, clothes, bags, etc.,but more than half are imported goods. we only walked for 20min then spent another 2hours in coffee shops. if for shopping, at least 2hours. Myeongdong is also renowned for restaurants but we didnt go to any. street food looks tasty. if you are interested in cosmetics shopping or want to experience business shopping street then try myeongdong, for other purposes, there are many better places in Seoul to visit. :-)"
801,4.0,"This is the place to be for korean shopping!!! local brands with very affordable price and high quality goods. forget about the bargains in south gate and dongdaemun this is the hippest place! My advise book a hotel in savoy, skyparkhotel 1 make sure its near spao store or Ibis hotel you are right smack in myeongong area!!!"
802,4.0,"you will be swapped away by the whole street of shops of cosmetic, skin care products. Laneige, SkinFood, Tony Moly, etc. you name the brand and you will definitely get very good quality bargain products. And the best part, they are so generous with their free sample packs and gifts....."
803,5.0,"Besides the department stores, there are so many Korean cosmetics stores such as Nature Republic, The Face Shop, Skin Food, Etude etc. there are also many street vendors selling snacks to all kinds of goods. Many people expecially young Korean couples around. Me and my girls just can't stop buying the cosmetics product since the price is so cheap compared to our place.Even if you are not into shopping, just be there to watch the happenings!"
804,4.0,"Just a tip, go here at night!! There are street stalls at night which are selling lot of stuff. You can find also street food stalls in the area. Indeed a cool place to shop especially bags and beauty products. We bought more than 10 bags for only 10000 won each! And also we bought facial masks and Missha bb creams for a cheap price. Missha bb creams are almost only half of the prices here in our country plus they give so many freebies!! Loving this place!  My favorite place in Seoul!! If we get back in Seoul, Myeongdong is in our top list!! yay!  PS: hungry? try Yoogane restaurant! They sell authentic Korean food. We really love their fried rice. How good? We ate 4 times there for our dinner. hehe.. =)"
805,3.0,"I can imagine if you can shop all day, this area is perfectly for you. My wife did her shopping in about two to three hours, then we walked along different streets. There were so many people and you couldn't see both sides of the shops. Therefore there was no such thing as ""window shopping"". A lot of brands can be found in all other areas of Seuol rather than Myeongdon, why I have to be pushed around and watch my steps carefully. Relax!"
806,4.0,"Shopping in Korea can be fun, or not, but Myeongdon was quite interesting. It's mostly women's clothing shops and little stalls (I mean little, size of a bathroom stall). My wife had a good time browsing the latest Asian fashion and bought a few items. It was fun just to see the number of vendors in all the different buildings and so much clothing in one little area. It shouldn't be missed if you are into ladies fashion."
807,5.0,"What can I say? it's all here. everything you could have imagined putting in your suit case and bringing home is here. From major department store chains selling the finest quality luxury brands, to mom and pop shops selling high quality knock offs. Great resturaunts, food carts and everything in between, it's all here.  This place is so popular that they never completely close, Don't waste your time trying to be clever by trying to find an off day with lower volume because this district is jam packed 7 days a week. The good news is that all the stores, stalls, carts, and shops that make their living here are completely used to the maddening crowds and have perfectly adapted to it.  You will not have to wait any longer here for a meal to be served at a resturaunt or for someone to ring up your purchace as you would in any other shopping district in Seoul. It is really quite amazing to watch just how efficiant this place operates! it's multi tasking at a level you will never see back home..  In fact, this is a must see just for the experience alone, becase you have never seen anything like it before and likely won't again... Even if you don't spend a dime here it will be somthing you will never forget."
808,4.0,"PSY's Gangnam style is blasting at night, and lots of neat food stands for cheap snacks or meals. Lots of shops and Lotte Department is a must-see to see how Koreans shop, especially at rush hour at the basement where you can grocery shop, or eat at stalls. South of this district you can walk up towards Namsan and N Seoul Tower."
809,5.0,"i am a white 50+ woman, been there several times on my solo trips through Seoul. Last time i spent about 5 hrs browsing the crooked streets - bargaining, sipping free ginseng tea, talking to vendors (some of them speak English). I watched some kind of official police rade last time. I shoped with US $$ and with a C/C (some vendors have computerized shops)."
810,4.0,Great shopping if youre on a budget. you can ask for discounts even at department stores. Make up and accessories overload.
811,5.0,"I live in Japan and travel to Seoul almost every year to stock up on cosmetics, clothing and to get my fill of fantastic Korean cuisine. Myeongdong is always at the top of my list."
812,5.0,"1. Easily accessible by subway. Just get off at the MyeongDong station. 2. If you don't speak English or Korean, shops, especially skin care and restaurants, have employees who speak Mandarin. 3. I had a sausage in a stick all wrapped in french fries for only 2000 Won (street vendor). Very inexpensive and fulfilling. Couldn't finish it! Yum. 4. The same brand has different stores in Myeongdong. I shopped at one store and they allowed me to leave my purchase with them while I shop at other stores. Be sure you get a business card from them (with the store number) to retrieve your purchase. 5. They give you samples when you make a purchase. The bigger the purchase, the more samples you'll get. 6. Before you go, you can check online to see if they're having any promotions for foreign tourists. You'll get, for example, 10% off your purchase if you're a foreign tourist. Make sure you go to the correct store. The coupon would state the name of the store and the store number. 7. If you get too tired from shopping or purchase too much, you can find taxis next to the subway station exits."
813,4.0,"Good shopping, with a good mix of foreign and local brands of clothes. Lots of beauty shops too. There are also wide selection of food places.  The prices are varied, I got a 3,900won local Tshirt to a more expensive foreign label SuperDry.  Just one tip though : be very careful when buying the beauty products - look at the expiry dates, especially when the prices are much cheaper than other places."
814,4.0,"Street that always crowds by people..nothing much i bought from here but i had fun with their 'pasar malam' atmosphere with new thingy that i had ever see. The most attraction i was looking for here is Spao. It is a boutique that must to visit by kpop fans though. You can enjoy everysing on the 5th floor, and dont forget to take sticker pictures with your bias. They offered awesome stuffs at affordable price. You also can visit everysing at apgujeong branch but you may feel regret if not buy anything at myeongdong branch which is the main everysing shop. M plaza also located in myeongdong, which Kimchi Academy is located, where you can book kimchi experience and hanbok wearing package. Hanji mirror making also including in the package with 30,000 won for 2 hours class. Classes offered in Korean, Japanese or English. They open for new package with ddeobokki making experience for 2012.  Popular Hello Kitty cafe also located here, that one i had skip on my last journey. will visit next time. Myeongdong also one of the place to buy sourvenir but no much choices and quite expensive that you can find the same thing at cheaper price at other market."
815,5.0,"Almost everything is here, from branded stuff to regular Korean fashion - good to spend at least half a day here!"
816,5.0,"I went there with three girls and we had the best-est time!! The energy of the place was intoxicating and we just kept laughing the whole time. The streets got lots of people so you have to keep moving, but you can always squeeze in some pictures in. We ate all some street food there of intestines, seafood pancakes. It was a fun experiencing eating with locals and curious tourists alike. At the day we went, there were celebrities endorsing the SPAO clothing shop so there were lots of screaming and crying people in front of the shop. My friends took home some paparazzi pictures also. As for the shopping, the clothes there werent the best but it was ok as I went there for the facial and body care products.Your friends can have fun time choosing from the wide array of affordable face masks, creams and scrubs. With each buy, you get tons of freebies, and theyre very generous with it (cotton, facial wipes, bottles of toner and moisturizer etc,,it can be a good enough souvenir to some of your friends back home) One thing I notice was though was most of the salespeople there go after Chinese tourists and can either speak Korean or Chinese, so it feels alienating if you know neither. But luckily, two of my friends were Chinese so we got very helpful and enthusiastic service from the stores."
817,5.0,"This is awesome for shopping, especially for tourists. It's great cause most of the outdoor walking area has no vehicles, only pedestrians. We went on a weekday afternoon, so it wasn't too crowded, but I imagine when evening comes, there will be tons of people! Lots of different types of shops and priced from high end to nice cheap bargains! Great for souvenir shopping too! It's also a better place to find more Western sized clothing as there lots of brand name shops. Tons of beauty and skin product shops, which was my favorite part!! Korean shops are also very generous so you get tons of sample of other beauty products when you shop in their stores. Girls would stand outside the shops to try to get you to go in, and often they would give you free stuff even if you just go in and browse (I got some free face masks). Lots of places to stop for a drink or a snack if you get tired. Overall, a MUST GO if you are in Seoul."
818,5.0,"This place is surely a woman's heaven. There are so many brands of cosmetic products which sells at fraction of the price. My spouse went crazy shopping and was smilling from ear to ear.... Happy Shopping, ladies !!"
819,5.0,"I only had a few hours shopping at Myeongdong in July while on a business trip. The stores don’t open that early. I got there shortly before 10 in the morning and some of the shops are just setting up. There are a couple of cosmetics stores that are “must stop by” places if you are interested in Korean cosmetics. The Missha store in particular was worth stopping by. The same product is $30 online and I got it for around $12. If you are interested in fashion, then Myeongdong is definitely better than Namdaemun Market. The stores at Myeongdong have trendier stuff than Namdaemun Market, which is only a short walking distance away. Namdaemun Market is better for the older generation to buy clothes, also household items. If you can, plan your day so that you can have lunch at Myeongdong. I had Bibimbap (mixed rice with vegetables), yum….."
820,5.0,"Myeongdong is a must-visit when touring Korea. With products ranging from tornado potato chips to designer shoes, Myeongdong boasts everything in Korean cosmetics, food, toys and fashion. Its perfect location (centered in Seoul) allows such resources. The busy hustle of food carts on every street will ensure that you have a delightful time : you simply cannot not ignore the famous elderly woman sitting by the entrance stirring up dalgonas to spice up your visit. Although overcrowded at times, such chaos is what makes Myeongdong the perfect place to take a dive into Korean culture and socialize. Visiting in the morning may also help: Myeongdong is relatively peaceful earlier in the day, although there may be less food vendors."
821,3.0,"Easy to Get lost, there are many of the same stores at walking distance so its Easy to get confused or disoriented; prices are really good for all korean beauty products and shoes, but you have to ready for room in your suitcase. Its overwhelming so better if you have a list of brands and products you want to save time ."
822,4.0,"This is the place to go for street shopping and people watching. It can be quite crowded. There is plenty to eat, including semi-exotic things from a USA perspective. There are also plenty of markets selling everything from clothes to electronics to candy.  Definitely visit this part of town."
823,4.0,"Go early evening to enjoy the food stalls, & check out the Chicken & Beer bars (that's exactly what they serve!)."
824,5.0,"This is an awesome area to shop and have some delicious street food. At night the whole place comes alive and it's just great walking around exploring all the side streets and deciding which street food to try next. So many shops to choose from and if you need some comfort from the west there is always Zara and H&M as well. There are ALOT of beauty shops, as there is all over Seoul. We can back here many times and found something new each time to explore."
825,4.0,should not miss this place. there are lots street food which are very Korean. you can go to restaurants or cafe. Shops - middle range. Crowded coz its popular.

827,5.0,"Love the area... all sorts of street food that was amazing!!! Shopping stores left & ryt!!! Its a convinient place to buy all sorts of things. They also have local grill restos that served good food. We ate during Xmas eve at one of the grill resto- i forgot the name, but the meat was delicious!!!"
828,5.0,"Wow! You have to visit Myeongdong- the shops here are amazing- lots of beauty shops in particular! “Free” face masks are offered to lure you into shops but sometimes you can just take them and keep walking. It is super crowded here so be aware you will be bumped into n jostled a bit- all part of the experience! By about 4pm the street food carts come out- oh my goodness the variety, the look n smell is delicious! Is there anything fried that is not tasty?? No!! Try the crepes with Nutella, banana n cornflakes- yum! Egg rolls, corn dogs, fried chicken- all sooo good!"
829,5.0,"Very busy, huge Korean and Western stores everywhere with amazing deals. We picked up a lot of awesome clothes and makeup for superb prices. Can strongly recommend."
830,5.0,There’s no shortage of Korean beauty products here. However if you’re looking for just about anything else chances are you’ll find it here. There’s also lots of food choices available.
831,3.0,"My first impression was cosmetics...cosmetics and lotsa cosmetics although i did see a uniqlo store down the road.. Honestly i didnt go into any of the cosmetics store who offered free masks (only if you go into the store). I ve had my share of experiences where you go in and it would take me all my might to just get out and continue elsewhere. I just walked past and it was a wonderful experience of sights, smell, hustle and bustle of everyone around. You can get lost in here lol"
832,5.0,"Perfect place for first timer. U get food and u get shopping. This is the place to shop for beauty products. Night market starts at about 4pm where vendors start setting up, buzzling till 11.30pm. very convenient with Myeongdong station and euljiro 1(San) station nearby."
833,4.0,"Surprisingly, of all the places that I have been to that are famous for street food such as Taiwan and Thailand, I actually like Seoul. I guess the only drawback for Seoul is that the street food is quite expensive and not exactly value for money. However, taste wise I really loved Seoul street food. They have all sorts of delicious food from cheesy lobster go soufflé with strawberries."
834,5.0,"Just beside Line 4 Myeongdong station exit 5, 6 7, 8, 9 n 10. A lot branded shop, hawker food stall, souvenir shop etc."

837,5.0,"My husband and I love shopping and this is a must! There is quite a verity of shops here, lots of cosmetics. If you enjoy shopping and people watching this is the place for you!"
838,5.0,"Best place to buy cosmetic products, shoes & clothes. Offers variety of street foods. Unfortunately all are not HALAL for muslim travellers. Good place to hang out."
839,4.0,It is the same night market every where. There are normal goods. A lot of Masks and skin care are sole there. Natural Publish is good quality and popular in Korea. You must try fried lobster in street. It is fresh and nice. Beef steak is nice too.
840,4.0,"Went here in the midst of winter, in the rain at -6 degrees. Despite the weather, the place was crowded with tourists trying all sorts of street food from cheesy baked scallops to cream puffs. In addition, one can try all sorts of beauty products and cosmetics which is cheaper than other outlets. Just have to be wary of hustlers who will try to persuade you to buy as many of their products as possible and will even reward you with a free luggage bag in you buy in bulk. A good place to shop and eat and enjoy the atmosphere."
841,4.0,"Loved the shopping around here. Everything we wanted for our girls trip. Can’t believe how active it is around the clock everyday of the week. Sales people in the street trying to get us into their stores was a little annoying which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. Great food, products and access to surrounding neighborhoods in Seoul."
842,5.0,"Shopping, eating, sightseeing...it's all here. Almost all kinds of shops can be found here. The street food especially at night really made our trip memorable, it was sooo good! You can see different kinds of people walking around, fun to walk around here."
843,5.0,I stay at the hotel at Myeongdong and had most of my meals here. Great Korean restaurant as well as street food. Hot food during the cold weather. Not to be missed.
844,5.0,"Crowded as usual but a lot of shopping can be done here. For those looking to purchase korean snacks and smaller items/accessories, suggest to compare prices at each of the korean marts to get the best/most competitive prices"
845,5.0,"Myeongdong is a great place to shop, eat and a place to meet up Korean friends. It is easy to locate and easy to reach. It is just two stops away from Seoul.  It has lots of facial, skin products, trend clothing and foods. It even has a gun range! You can try it for the first time. 14 years old and above. Valid passport and cash of course.  Here you no need for guide, just walk the walk... try not to go on weekends, tonnes of tourists and koreans.  There is self cert halal food!"
846,4.0,"Great place to spend an evening. Many shops with great deals of cosmetic product. At the end of the road there are some multi storey malls with amazing food ""delicatesen"" in the basement."
847,5.0,Had heard so much about this shopping area but what was on display went beyond all that. This is the place for korean beauty products. Lots and lots of street food joints and you will be spoilt for choices. The food looks visually appearing and everything we tried was yummy. The streets are choc a bloc with shoppers and there it is fun to just sit somewhere munching on the food and watch the world go buy. You can spend hours at this place. A must visit if you are in Seoul
848,5.0,"Paradise for a girls soul. Cosmetic haven and absolute delight for Korean street food. Everywhere you look, there are shops selling Korean brand cosmetics. Shopping and savoring sumptuous street foods is a walk in heaven. A must visit to stock up on your common and wierd Korean cosmetics"
849,4.0,Interesting place if you're looking for cosmetics. Go for the street food as the restaurants here serve Korean food that's below par with a higher price. It's hard to bargain even with the stalls and mom-pop kind of retail outlets as I have the impression that they have fixed the prices.
850,4.0,This street is simply a good visit. There are all kinds of shops from stalls to big departmental stores and prices vary accordingly. It has great street food especially at night and it’s a good place to interact with everyday Koreans. It’s worth a visit
851,5.0,"Even if you are not a shopaholic, you would agree that this place is a shopping heaven especially for cosmetics. There's a lot of brands you can find here without good price. Find shop called, Baviphat where the items here are much cheaper than the other shops. If you are buying from the stalls, bargain as much as you can!"
852,5.0,"There are a lot of people and shops in this area. when I first went there, there were so many people that it was inconvenient but after a while i feel comfortable. If you want to taste Korean street food, go here!"
853,5.0,"I really2 like Myeongdong because I can visit it in night time and it still so full of people... If you looking for cosmetic, this is the place that you should visit. For muslim, there are food stal that has halal logo (even the chicken), just search the halal logo in the stall You can access the shopping district from myeongdong station and walk to euljiro4(sa)-ga (even though the areas near euljiro4(sa)-ga not to crowded. Along with the route you can find cheap cloth store (check out the basement of the store to pay and more goods)"
854,5.0,"Good street food, and a massive selection And range of shopping Options. Well worth a trip with all ages of children and adults"
855,4.0,"Must try the street food even some are repeatings. For the street clothes stall, we noticed that they are not putting any price tag. I guess if you are tourist, they will just quote you higher price. Please be alert and aware. Of course, the cosmetics is alot and many brands to choose and great offer for masks. During the trips to Seoul, I never purchase any mask even they are in cheap price. Because I have seen alot mask promo, they actually put the mask at outside the store during day time under the sun. Choose those store with tax free and with promo. Plan to go there at least 2-3 days so that you can see which store offering lower price for the same items."
856,5.0,Myeongdong is a must when visiting Seoul. There’s plenty of shopping and a variety of street foods to enjoy. If you get tired of that you can always go underground shopping. You can bargain and get get some deals too.
857,3.0,"If you love shopping , beauty products , clothes and food., you must go there and i really like this overcrowded area specialy at night with crazy food stands...a real must i would say. Also you can visit Seoul tower and hannam village."
858,3.0,"A lot of shopping options. Good street food options, but we had dinner prior, so we couldn't really eat anymore. Street food probably a bit expensive relatively compared to the restaurant options. Many shops, a lot of tourists, and a bit difficult to move around as there were so many people. Mostly selling cosmetics. Have never seen so many face masks in my life!"
859,5.0,"I spent 9 days in Seoul and must have gone to Myeongdong 3 or 4 times, I loved everything about this place, specially the night market with loads of good food. Definatly one of the best neighborhoods in Seoul."
860,5.0,Close to Lotte Hotel. Short walking distance and discovering little shops. Lovely Korean face creams found here.
861,4.0,There are so many shops here of various sizes selling a variety of items. At night a large number of food and drink stalls are set up with a. huge variety of tasty Korean foods. It does get very busy but well worth a visit
862,5.0,"Street food and shopping. Also you can buy souvenirs and treats, like the famous almond honey butter and cute socks.  Its a very lively place, big crowd.  There are a lot of restos in this area, better check them out."
863,5.0,"Many shops to shop and plenty of street food stalls, even halal food are available. Many options to buy souvenirs to bring home for family and friends"
864,3.0,"Please make sure you compare prices before you make your decision to buy. Prices vary double. I bought some nuts in a shop which offered tasting. (It looked like special store), it costs W6,300 each. I picked few bags with different flavours and paid. Once I stepped out and walked to the next shop which offered buy one , get one free. Another similar experience was happened in Namdaemun market, I bought 2 packs of stainless steel chopsticks at W5,000 each, at the next shop ( just 3 steps away), it costed W10,000 for 3 packs. This experience told me that I need to compare prices in different shops before I make final decision to buy."
865,5.0,"So many shops and nice restaurants,cafe,etc... Start 4pm street foods. One day can spend this site. If with little kids bit hard area I think,coz so many peoples here."
866,4.0,"The night market is a must to visitors here... an excellent variety of local el fresco food available to cater for all and some even sell Halal food. There are also retail outlets adjacent mostly selling cosmetics, sport shoes, etc !"
867,3.0,This place is too crowded and I only went there for shopping. Didn't try any restaurants there but luckily the snack along the side of the street was pretty good.
868,5.0,"The Myeongdong Market was easy to get to and the street food was the best. You Can sample fried chicken, octopus, escargot, squid, coffee and shop for clothing. There are so many vendors we loved it."
869,5.0,Highly recommend those who are interested in shopping (clothing/cosmetics) to stay in the area. The street comes alive at night when the food vendors push out their carts. Avoid the overly westernized foods as they are pricey and not very tasty. For those purchasing face masks/beauty make sure you shop around the same product can vary as much as 50% from a different store. Dr Jart masks are a must buy.
870,2.0,"We had a fabulous time shopping and trying the various foods sold along the streets in Myeongdong. The rose ice cream (6000KRW) was especially pretty and yummy. Green tea/yoghurt/strawberry flavour and also chocolate flavour. We also enjoyed Egg Bread (2000KRW), Chestnut, Ginko Seeds, Fish Ball skewers, bbq pork, and much more."
871,3.0,"I was not in a shopping mood but I explored the area as part of my vacation workout  too much food to choose from. check out the live seafood (eels and octopus)  cute police station, good place to exchange currency. I saw only 1 street bum.  beauty products.... look at the foam"
872,3.0,Most of the shops closes at 11pm. Restaurant closes earlier. Very busy area with lots and lots of cosmetic shops everyone trying to lure you in with free samples.  Food stalls offers typical street food of Korea.  Worth a visit once.
873,5.0,"This is what we were looking for, an experience of sound, light, food, and aromas that assault your senses. As soon as we began our walk through the area we knew this was the real Seoul we has come to see. Crowded streets filled with pedestrians, flashing neon, and a cornucopia of food to sample and wares to buy. It is something to experience at night or at least early evening, things just get going at dusk. There are all sorts of stores to shop and food to eat, you decide what you want. We just enjoyed taking it all in and strolled the alleys and streets, people watching and observing. I do recommend the fried curly potato on a stick rolled in BBQ seasoning."
874,4.0,"With expectations set pretty high after watching loads of Youtube videos on this neighborhood, I was understandably left feeling 'eh' about it after getting a chance to experience this for a few days.  First off, I loved the vibe of the neighborhood, despite how crowded it became every night. That said, the neighborhood actually is not that big - two main thoroughfares, primarily, each maybe 4-5 blocks long. Lots of side streets with other shops and food options, but the main action really is on the thoroughfares. Lots of cosmetic shops, lots of cheap clothing of the Forever 21 quality level.  The street food was very much hit or miss, nothing completely mind blowing. Lots of repeat stands, but note that not all the stands have the same quality. I tried to use the length of the lines for each as a rough gauge on how good the stand may be - also a hit or miss approach.  Two tips and heads up (literally): - there are a lot of hidden eateries, cafes, and shops in all the buildings above ground level. really pay attention and look up to see what you may be missing out on! I found a few cafes that I loved - grab a coffee and a window seat and you can people watch all the action down below for awhile - garbage cans are really hard to come by. stay with the vendor you purchase food from and chuck your garbage with them after you're done, or come prepared"
875,5.0,"We went down several times in the evening. Street food is very diverse and even finer. The atmosphere is inimitable, real Korea!"
876,5.0,"One can basically shop till they drop as there are countless of shops selling cosmetics, clothes, souvenirs, etc. There are also many restaurants and cafes in the area.  The street vendors will start setting up their stalls from about late morning and finishes late at night. Many of these vendors sell street food as well as other stuffs, so the area is a great spot to try Korean street food.  Do bear in mind that in the evening and night, this place is packed. Also, we found some street vendors are selling some souvenirs at much higher prices than in Namdaemun market.  Overall, it is a great spot for shopping and getting food, whether it is restaurant or street food."
877,4.0,"Otherwise known as cosmetic street, I found it very busy and expensive, compared to other places. I also believed I got more samples of cosmetic when I brought stuff in other areas of Seoul. Also restaurants in the are are expensive, and feels a bit like tourist rip off central."
878,4.0,"Everything at hand - food, cosmetics, clothes, things you need and don't need. Very touristy but worth a visit if first time. Vibe is very foodie related! Enjoy ;)"
879,4.0,"Myeongdong is a haven for Korean beauty products. The atmosphere was buzzing in this area. I only visited in the night time and there was an array of street food. One thing to note is that you'll see the same shops every 100-200 metres apart so if you're not looking for anything specific but are on a time crunch, I'd suggest visiting the bigger branches which should have everything. However if you're looking for specific Brands/products, you may have to visit different branches if brand/product isn't as popular. For example, I was looking for COSRX products which I found only to be available in certain branches of Olive Young."
880,4.0,"Beauty products, clothings, bags, socks, snacks, street food, cafes, tea houses, everything you need is here. Be sure to have a list before going to this area because you might end up buying things you dont really need. Kpop stuffs are abundant. You can get a lot of samples if you buy from cosmetic shops and they usually give you another item free. Dont get lost by taking picture of the street where you enter so you can go back to that area in going to your place. Street food costs around 3,000-4000 kr won, cosmetics at 1000-75.000 kr won and clothing from 6000-15,000 won for cheapest range. Restos from 12,000-33,000 kr won, its a set meal usually good for 3-4 pax. You will really enjoy this place. A must visit for traveler. A lot of cheap accomodation in the area."
881,4.0,"here is a place where you can buy make ups and tons of korean beauty products. they also have some restaus, pharmacies, groceries and street food. live the street food especially the fried banana and glazed strawberries"
882,5.0,"very neat and organised shopping street, good stuffs ranging from cheap until branded. the attractive ones are line shop and art box. the place is also very instagrammable problem is quite hard to find that can show the direction in English, since the google maps doesn't help a lot in finding certain spots by walking. Still very interesting place to visit even more than 1 time during one visit. will try again to visit during night time with different ambiences of course. Since it would take a lot of walking, good shoes and nice weather/ season choosing would be important."
883,5.0,"The Myeongdong marketplace is a large area offering a large variety of clothing, beauty products, and food vendors. It comes alive after 5:00 PM with young people and tourists converging into the area. Of special note is the “Cookin’ Nanta” theatrical production located in the heart of Myeongdong. A definite “must see”. Also, if you like lobster, the bbq lobster tails with cheese are scrumptious. Numerous street vendors offer this delight."
884,5.0,"We stay at nine tree Myeong-dong2 hotel ,about a block away from the shopping area Nice walk up the litter hill and you are there , after 4pm all the street food stall starting to come out and in no time at all every corner is fill with food stall , prepare to go there with an empty stomach, everything you can imagine it’s there , wow what a place to be I feel like a kid , wanting to try everything, because of so many different type of food we went there 3 night in a roll just to try as much as we can"
885,3.0,Good to see just for the sake of knowing how it looks like in person. But it’s just like any other shopping destinations in asia with focus on beauty and skincare products. Although there are other selections too like clothes and shoes. Street food’s quite nice if you’re starving while shopping. That’s all there is to it.
886,5.0,"This is definitely a great place to stop by. Even if you don't care for shopping too much, they have a lot of great street food options and it's just really cool to see and experience.  If you do love shopping, then this will be glorious. Maybe even to the point that it can get overwhelming. Not only do they have hundreds of shops in a bunch alleys, there are multiple (and I mean MULTIPLE) of the same shop. So, if you're looking for Etude House, you'll probably find 4+ of those. It can get confusing considering how many alleyways there are. Also, the stands will have some shopping too.  Overall, a great place but if you're wanting to shop I'd suggest dedicating at least a few hours. It's a lot to go through."
887,4.0,The most colorful area of Seoul. The paradise of cosmetics and fine coffee. People from all over the world are doing their shopping and at the same time tasting amazing local delicacies from street vendors. Don't be afraid to try them! The market starts from the Catholic Cathedral and reaches the Lotte department store.
888,4.0,It's hard to believe how busy this street is when the rest of Seoul is quiet. This street is a must-visit place. There are so many street foods to try and many restaurants are open late into the night. The best part of this street is the food. Don't miss it.
889,5.0,We really enjoyed our visit here even though there are a lot of shoppers going around for this is a famous place that you need to visit when in Korea. Since my daughter loves korean beauty n makeup products she really went crazy buying stuffs for it is much cheaper here. Their street food is good if you're not picky.
890,5.0,"Skincare, cosmetics and so many other korean products you can find in this area. Prices are reasonable but it sure is cheaper than buying them from my country. So if youre into korean beauty products there's a line of shops that carry your favorite k- brand that you can choose. You can also buy many other things like korean snacks, souvenirs, cute things and a whole lot more."
891,5.0,A nice place to spend the evening with the street foods and shops opened until late night. For middle easterners the a halal restaurant Saffron Restaurant is just around the corner.
892,5.0,Amazing and almost overwhelming! So many vendors to choose from-all assortments of goods and food stalls. Packed at peak times but that is part of the experience! A must see in Seoul!
893,5.0,"Myeongdong shopping street and the accompanying underground shopping belt is full of surprises. Look out for the largest Uniqlo, and the “factory outlet” of the famed flavoured nut snacks... nuzzling and busy.  Maybe it’s me but the Underground shopping belt is strangely similar to platinum mall in Bkk...."
894,5.0,"Nice environment, variety, reasonable prices, good service and great food. Definitely will come back! I recommend this place!"
895,5.0,"Here you can find whatever you want: any kinds of foods, souvenirs, cosmetics, toys and whatever other items you would like to bring from Korea at affordable prices.

899,4.0,"If you are in Seoul, head to this place for some shopping. It's basically a street shopping market. You can bargain too and that's depend upon your ability how well you can do so. One can get a few souvenirs from here."
900,4.0,"Lots to see and do, jam packed with shops selling facial products and clothes, lined with street stalls selling local fare. Full of life, definitely worth a visit (even if you don’t shop like me) to soak up the local culture."
901,5.0,"During our stay in Seoul we visited myeongdong everyday before we went back to our hotel. myeongdong is very good if you like kpop as the underground market has all the CD’s and other merch for very good prices. If you aren’t into kpop the street itself has all the best clothes shops, skincare and other little stalls dotted around from etude house to forever 21. I highly recommend people visit this street at least once on their trip to Seoul! (Also you must get a twisted potato, it was so yummy)"
902,5.0,"Paradise for a shopaholic. Many shops for every taste. Large shopping centers and small cosmetics stores. Huge selection of everything. Plus a colorful, atmospheric street with local food. I’m writing, but the stomach itself sucked. This is an amazing place!"
903,3.0,"It’s a fun street to stroll once, not more. Try cute and various street food and shop for cosmetics. But it is super crowded which makes it a bit stressful unless you like crowd :)"

905,4.0,"If you like shopping this is the place to go .with regards to street food was NOT impressed at all .oily foods seems to take over.you get better food in small Korean restaurants close by ,and much better value for your money"

908,5.0,I stayed at Myeong-dong and the place is best during the night when the streets are full of food stalls. And the choices of food and makeup products is vast
909,3.0,Myeongdong is famous for shopping and street food. The area was filled with tourists and foreigners. I loved street food but it's too crowded to walk comfortably at times.
910,5.0,"Was a magnificent arrive ,we walk from our hotel ,the Royal Seoul Hotel,enjoy the several types of snacks from street vendors,cosmetics shops,lots people speak english,you can get chips for your celular phone,drugstore at the corners ,massage feet,...Kool days..!!!!!"

912,5.0,"My family and I loved going to Myeongdong Shopping Street. My advise is to go after 4:00pm, when the streets are filled with street food ranging from 1000 won to 7000 won. I recommend to try anything that looks good! Our favorites were: fish cakes on a stick, barbecue chicken on a stick, tornado potato, mini kimbap, ice cream with honey comb, takoyaki, Milky bee rose ice cream, and fluffy soufflé pancakes at Innisfree Green Cafe."
913,5.0,"When you look for a place to shop and eat , this is quite a place you need to go to check out first."
914,5.0,After hearing mass in the Myeongdong Cathedral....where to next but dinner in the streets! Did not disappoint. A must do when in Seoul.
915,5.0,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is bustling with activity. You can't help yourself but spend some KR $ . Name brand of course. In the afternoon at 4pm is the start of all good things ... STREET FOOD. Delicious food of all things grilled or fried. I had the best Chop Chae Noodles, try it. This area is a MUST to visit. In need of a MASSAGE, there are many choices. People will hand out flyers and guide you to them. I personally tried 2 places. Both were clean and massages were good. Take your pick, it will help your aching feet and back."
916,4.0,"We were in Seoul in December so Myeongdong Shopping Street(s) were festively lighted up in the evening. It is perpetually crowded with tourists. It's a haven for cosmetic, clothes and jewellery lovers and if you scout around, you may get good bargains. Lots of food vendors in the streets as well. Food is pricier here compared to the nearby Dongdaemun and Namdaemun markets. Nevertheless when in Seoul, you must at least experience shopping in Myeongdong Street. A good tip is to book hotels (there are budget, midprice and luxury hotels so do your homework before you book) nearby so that after a day out and about at the sights, you can have a relaxing walkaround, do some shopping and have your dinner in this area."
917,4.0,"Myeongdong is a character place in Seoul. I have been there for the 3rd time with my two visits in Seoul. On my first visit it did not reaally make a sense to me, but it was just an ordinary shopping area full of people. My recent trip last June make me appreciate Myeongdong. Why did I say that it is a character place. From the train station you will be greated by a a foreign exchange cum shoe repair shop. The exchange rate is very good. As you go along on the alley left and right are cosmetic shops of different Korean brands. It comes to my mind why the skins of the Koreans are so clear and beautiful. Walk . . . walk. . . and at the middle you will be greated by their iconic theater, the ""I"" tourist information personnel who will assist you if you have any questions. Their is also the Myeongdong Cathedral for the spiritual side ( a must see). There are also lots of Korean restaurants that will answer for your gastronomic needs. One thing, I thought ""Daiso and Uniqlo"" is in Japan only, suprisingly I found it in Myeongdong. And if you will go into food trip (Korean food) lots of it could be found at the middle of the Myeongddong Alley. I know that for every tourist who visited Seoul, Myeongdong will not be missed out"
918,4.0,"First off: cosmetics, you will find soooooo many brands and they have at least two to three shops in the area, so if what you're looking for is not on one shop, find the location of the other shop of the same brand. There is a tourism office near a big Global Tax Free department store and a money changer along MyeonDong Gil Street. You can get your map there.  Tip: Get the freebie and enter the shop. It doesn't necessarily mean you'll buy. They give free face mask to the people who will enter the store.  Next is the street foooooodss.. the main street is full of different street foods which are must try. We literally went from one stall to the other. Their skewers are great and they have lots of delicious stuff cooking.. If you like to explore street food, try everything out. Especially their very high ice cream. 52cm they say.  Tip: find the ice cream store near Pretty Skin Shop in MyeonDong Gil St. it only cost 2000KRW other ice cream stalls have higher price.  Cafe: there is a Meerkat cafe in the area. You can experience cuddling a meerkat by buying drinks which includes the entrance fee. or you can rest in some other cafes (there are many cafes you could choose from)  Traditional food experience: you may want to go down the smaller alleys near the exits of the area to experience traditional korean food at a cheaper price in a homey atmosphere. We have eaten at a small underground canteen (can't read the signboard) which serves food for as low as 5000KRW with big servings good enough for two people.  Best time to go is in the afternoon to evening, but it is also the busiest."
919,4.0,"I think I know every street here by now. It is a relatively large area with modern shops which attract mostly young people. Girls clothing shops and make up are abundant, as are restaurant and bars. I like the street food the best. There is something for every one. Nearby is the Lotte department store and posh brand section."
920,4.0,Many stores are along with the street. Nowadays many cosmetics and street food are seen. The street is for pedestrians only. No cars
921,4.0,"Lots of shopping for the ladies, besides bags, clothings & cosmetics you can also find Daiso, sport wear, and many dining options. Sad to say, Myeongdong is losing its shine as the place have evolved to serve tourist appetite. I hope it’s unique Korea shopping area can refocus on it’s uniqueness."
922,5.0,"Heart of tourist area at seoul. Everything you could find here. From food, shopping, bar, coffee shop, etc... should stay here at least 2 to 3 days to explore."
923,5.0,Nice place Shop for cosmetics some shops offer tax refund and discount with a minimum 30-50k won Streetfoods Branded shops Bakery Resto The cathedral is located here

925,3.0,"Lots of street food and cosmetic stores. Very convenient. Went there but can’t enjoy too much bcoz too crowded and people makes you keep walking. A lot of cosmetic places. If you buy more than $30000, will do the tax free for you immediately. Bring your passport.  Enjoyed the environment but can’t really have a mood to buy stuffs slowly."
926,5.0,"Usually am not a fan of shopping but Myeongdong had many shops that sell nice food, interesting souvenirs and clothes to be brought home as souvenirs. Possible to spend the entire night here and yet not walk finish."

928,5.0,Love this street!  We stayed in a boutique hotel in the centre of this area. Worth visiting during the night when it is fully lit.  Definitely sample some of the street food on offer.
929,4.0,"Even though I hate crowded places I find myself going to Myeongdong quite often. That’s because I really like the big H&M and Forever21 stores there. Also, I guess there’s no better place if you want to buy a variety of korean cosmetics in one place. Plus, you can try many street food there.  What I don’t like about Myeongdong, except for the crowds, are people advertising their makeup store with giving you “free” masks or so.. Guys, these are no free unless you buy something from their store. And the other thing is that there’s really no good restaurant there."
930,5.0,"Myeongdong is a great area to visit. Great eats. Anything tried was delicious. Egg pancakes, fresh cut fruit, steak, fries banana, tornado potato. Street food at its best. Loads of shopping. Clothes, cosmetics, skincare, shoes. Visit the cathedral as well. There is a tourism office near the Myeongdong Theatre if you need to ask about city bus tours."
931,5.0,"Shopping in the cold is one experience i will probably remember as my wife and daughter enjoyed a lot and did not mind doing.. It made me sick though I may probably do it with more prepared proper clothing. Lots of interesting things to see, buy and eat. Be ready to burn your wallet."
932,5.0,"Best place to shop for cosmetics. Must visit if you go to Korea. They have a lot of discounts on different brands of cosmetics. Must visit. They have etude house shops which have good discounts. Also, the salespeople outside the shops will give you a lot of samples to try"
933,5.0,"Shop til you drop, not kidding. You can stop and get a bite to eat at many restaurants and at street food vendors, and go back to more shopping. We simply loved every minute of it. So many cosmetic stores and you can spend hours there looking at so many different products. It's very reasonable there too. I bought a trench coat for only $45 and the best part is that it fits! I'm very short so most clothes need to be altered but not here in Korea. Most of the clothes were made for Asian women I think because they fit really well."
934,4.0,Myeondong shopping area is a great place to amble through day or night. The street food is amazing and incredibly good value for money.
935,5.0,"Busy small streets at night. Lots of small shops that sells everything from beauty products, electronic gadgets, and clothes. We went for the atmosphere. The shops facade are heavily decorated with neons and lights. Feels like you're in a manga."

939,5.0,"Myeongdong is filled with many different Korean brands of cosmetic and skincare. Many different price range and every outlet has different promotions. There could be another same outlet on another street so be sure to check out the promotions before your purchase. Also, consolidate your purchases for higher tax refund/ rebate. The higher the amount, the higher the amount of tax refund.  Also check out the cafes such as the innisfree cafe."

I actually went there with zero intention to buy anything but still ended up with skincare and socks for family and friends.  If you’re looking to purchase Korean skincare, this place is great. There is sometimes good deals like ‘buy 1 free 1’ deals and always ask the sales people for free gifts and samples. Also remember to ask them for tourist tax refunds."

People always have some expectations about something. I had about this asian metropolis city own expectations. And when the time has come i saw it, i felt it...  P.S.: i think, it is better to visit this place when the Sun goes down."

In almost every corner you will find something. That’s aside from several souvenir shops , convenience stores , mini grocery , and stalls selling knock off designer shirts .

But the prices are not cheap. Yet I loved it. Included some photos ."
955,5.0,"Shops can be found everywhere. I find this place more affordable than the the other shopping areas i've been in other countries. Beauty products are affordable.

959,4.0,Great shopping place for cosmetics & sports wear. Plenty of food outlets and snacks stores. Spoilt with varieties of snacks in these stores. Do shop around for bargains. Stay on for the nite market where St foods is a must try. Do remember to pack warm clothes for the nite mkt(springtime is still cold at nite). If you are looking for F&B outlets do check out on the upper floor signage since the outlets are mostly on 2nd flr.
960,5.0,This place is the same like we have in the Philippines. It has too many people walking around like divisoria but the only difference is its safety. Food street stalls were clean and delicious. Shopping stalls were great.
961,5.0,"Very busy street but full of people, shops, market stalls and food. Lots of tourists and very crowded but this just adds to the atmosphere. Lots of delicious food to pick from with fantastic vendors very happy to help with non Korean speaking tourists."

There’s roasted cheesy lobster, butter shrimp, Oreo churros, Korean fishcakes etc."
966,5.0,"If you’re into street food, shopping, large crowds, high energy, or traveling with no kids, Myeongdong will suit your needs. If not, you might be overwhelmed and I don’t recommend this destination. This area is filled with tourist crowds all battling for the delicious street food. Each food vendor are $5 to $10 that varies from deserts to seared scallops. If the food vendors doesn’t hit your wallet, the multilple storefronts will. Want to shop for sneakers, clothes, beatufy face masks, or color contacts? This area will serve your shopaholic needs. Bear in mind, this place is very touristy."
967,5.0,"Best area for shopaholics. Very vibrant area. For skincare lovers, this is the area to be. There have multiple top franchise at basically every corner of the street."

969,3.0,"Other than that, the night market is filled with vendors selling clothes, street food and souvenirs.  The clothes and souvenirs IMHO a bit pricey due to the place being frequented by tourists.  As for the street food, you may just want to indulge eventhougg they may not be the tastiest."
970,5.0,"If you are a food lover, you must check this place out. The vendors starts setting up around 3-4pm and it’s open until around 10pm. There’s also a lot of stores to shop around."

It was a place with korean skincare everywhere, korean streetfood everywhere, and some branded stuff official stores too. It's a shopping heaven !  But compare to Ewha and Itaewon, Myeongdong is lil bit more expensive. So be careful to spend your money in Myeongdong."
973,3.0,"I found things are overpriced compared with other shopping’s street.  Well, there still a lot of entertainment for your view."
974,4.0,"We last visited Myeongdong four years ago, in summer, with an adult daughter in tow, who wanted to visit seemingly every single outlet on the street - an interesting but rather exhausting experience.  This time around, in much less busy February and with no pressure to buy anything specific, we found it a much more enjoyable experience, just ambling along and watching life going on all around us.  There is every conceivable cosmetic store here, sometimes multiple branches just a few hundred meters from each other - just in case they don’t tempt you in the first time - interleaved with fashion stores, shoe stores and sportswear mainly.  Many of the stores have ‘Greeters’ outside, whose job it is to persuade you in. There are also lots of people with flyers for such things as massages, cat cafes etc, which are located just offering the main shopping streets. You do need to adopt a firm stance.  There are lots of good offers on cosmetics, which are of high quality in Korea. Many stores will give you samples too although, as an ‘Aajuma’ who clearly doesn’t wear make up, I don’t seem to fit the criteria, or perhaps I just didn’t spend enough! When we were here with our daughter she almost had more samples than purchased goods.  Obviously the character of the shops within these streets are aimed at particular tastes and interests but, even if you aren’t specifically going to buy something, this is a uniquely Korean experience, and you might just find something that you had no idea you needed."
975,4.0,Not too crowded til around 11am when most shops open. You just might miss the UNESCO engraving on the floor about 50 steps going to the church base stairs. Some of the oldest Korean restaurants can be located there.
976,5.0,The absolute epitome of Asian Urban shopping. Many Korean products and crowded but colourful and energetic location.
977,5.0,"We stayed 5 nights at Metro Hotel Myeongdong. The best place if we go for eat and shopping with teenagers. There are many streetfoods around the streets every 4pm until night. We just walked 5min from hotel to find the streetfoods and so many cosmetic store in myeongdong. Ettude, Innisfree, Faceshop, Tonimolly, Olive Young, etc. Odeng = Fish Cake = 2000 won, Pork Barbeque = 6000 won, Tornado potato = 3 or 4000 won We also ate Korean fried chicken such as BHC = 18000 won for 1 package = 9 drumsticks. Myeongdong has 2 sunway : Euljiro 1 ( Green Line 2 ) and Myeongdong ( Light Blue Line 4 ). Our hotel is near Euljiro 1 Exit 5 or 6 ( only 2min )."
978,5.0,"I went 2 times , i love the street and it was good experience to see the street food and I tried 🍗. Also there was allot of makeup shops everywhere."
979,3.0,I had heard a lot about the shopping here but i was not very satisfied with the experience. It was crowded and your pace will be dictated by the oldest and slowest in the crowds. The merchandise on sale mostly appeated to be generic knock-offs and no-name fabrics. The bargaining was half-hearted at best. The other less popular markets and shopping streets are better so i'd skip this one if you are on a limited timetable or looking for something specific.
980,5.0,"Crazy place to go shopping as people try to drag you into every store, but worth the experience and you can definitely get some good bargains while you're there!"
981,5.0,"A shoppers paradise, one can find every top local and Premium international brands here. The market starts from Myeongdong Subway station and ends at Lotte Department Store. Myeongdong shopping street also boosts of many restaurants serving Western, Japanese cuisine in addition to Korea. And there are carts serving local delicacies."
982,4.0,"This group of streets offers so much to do, see and eat!! There are so many shops, both big global shops like Zara and Nike. However, there are cool street vendors too. The streets are also packed with beauty stores, filled with make up products and all the latest skincare things too.  The street food, that opens from around 2pm is also FANTASTIC!!! You can get lobster tails - strawberries on a stick. Crepes to fried noodles or a kebab. They have it all!!  Be prepared for the CROWDS though!! It's always pscked!!!"
983,5.0,Myeongdong is one of my favorite places in Seoul! I love all the stores and the street food is amazing. If you’re looking for Korean Skincare this is the place to be! Missha is my favorite!
984,1.0,"Why would you shop in Korea? Sure you can get Korean cosmetics, but everything else is way over priced because of the taxes. It's a known fact."
985,4.0,Very very crowded street. Lots of shops for skin care products and clothing. All kinds of street food available if you are a non-vegetarian. One can easily spend 3/4 hours shopping and enjoying the street food.

989,4.0,"If its cosmetics, clothing and shoes that one is looking for, look no further. We were here on Christmas day and the narrow streets were literally shoulder-to-shoulder walking space. Not enough space to stretch out your hands let alone swing a cat! Cosmetics are cheap (So says my wife). Its worth a walk thru and there are lots of street food vendors around."
990,5.0,"Almost every well known Korean brand can be found here and Main Street branches into side streets. Lots of F&B outlets - from cafes to restaurants to tea house ...  At night, the street is lined with Hawkers selling local snacks like Potato tornado, dumplings, cheese and rice cake on stick, fried chicken, maize, strawberries, bbq seafood etc ....  Really safe environment with a police station right in the centre of this area.  Clothing, accessories and skincare are easily available. Sports shops like ABC Mart etc"
991,5.0,"U can find almost everything here, halal food is also available at this street. Stay near by this street walking distance, stayed at Skypark Central Hotel. We visit this street every nite for food and on my last day I shop for cosmetic and shoes."
992,5.0,I love this shopping district in Seoul where all items you want are available from high end items to mid range goods and products and street foods. Stay at this area for your unlimited exploration of this area. I love Myeongdong very much because of the many coffee shops here and restaurants offering Korean food and other international cuisines. This is a must see when you are in Seoul. Stay at Ibis Hotel Myeongdong because it is very near the area.
993,4.0,"Had the absolute best buttered prawns here. Don't be fooled by the street market appearance. Some of the food sold by the stalls here can even qualify for a Michelin star! So much variety from seafood, to pancakes, to traditional Korean food. Lots of cheap, imitation clothes too."
994,5.0,Love love love Myeongdong. You can go crazy shopping here haha so much good food and cosmetics!!  Must try: - Aori Ramen - Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong - BHC Chicken  Must go: - SPAO - All the cosmetic shops (hahaha)
995,5.0,A Seoul must-do! So many street vendors selling clothes and food. Surrounded by several shops and cafes. So much yummy stuff you'll want to try so go with an empty stomach! it gets very busy. Also amazing at night time when it is covered in light
996,3.0,"the first time was great, all the food seemed tantalizing and yummy, shops all around abound with goods, as well as the ubiquitous korean beauty products.  the second time, we explored more of the alleyways connected with the main shopping row, thinking we might discover something new, did not happen. food stalls sell basically more of the same: hotdog with batter, fish cake, skewers, cheese lobster, fruit juices, milk tea, crepe, twisted potato, strawberry chocolates, egg bread, and cheese clam.  even the stores are repetitive: ABC Mart, Innisfree, Oliver Young, Lesmore... it got stale and boring pretty fast.  there are a few gems like Mother's Touch which sells mainly fried chicken and maaan so goooood. they're located on the 5th floor of a secluded building which you will miss if you stick to the middle of the road.  basically it's one big tourist trap. visit it once just so you can say you've visited. come back if you forgot something, other than that, it's an expensive and crowded place."
997,5.0,"This is a very famous shopping street, great varieties of street food, mouth watering food, shops for great shopping experience"
998,4.0,I walked around the area with a friend on a Friday night. There are lots of food stalls and restaurants in the area as well as many shops of different kinds - even underground shopping too. There are some bars as well but definitely more known for its food and shopping.
999,5.0,"Ranging from 3000Won to 8, this street is the ultimate experience on street food. Too bad no blood sausage or other traditional stuff seen in KD dramas but I think this is the best place to start. Foreigner friendly and accessible.  Toilet is in one of the malls unless you are dining in a restaurant... clean but a bit out of the way, so try not to drink too much :)"
1000,5.0,"Needless to say, Meyongdong is a shopper's heaven. Husband and I did, what's called a 'K-haul' from here and Hongdae. Best beauty brands have multiple outlets. We spent a lot of time at Olive Young, a drug store where you can find most brands! Innisfree, Cosrx (at Aland), Tony Moly, Etude House, Missha, The Face Shop are among the countless beauty brands we shopped for. We got there early the first time and spent almost the whole day, taking food and drink breaks and dropping shopping bags to our Airbnb which was only one station away. The area starts to get alive only after 6pm though. Lot's of vendors come out on the streets and the crowd starts to get thicker. A lot of shops don't open till 10 am so no point getting here too early."
1001,4.0,"Myeongdong is actually a district or a series of streets rather than only one. It attracts residents and visitors because of the shops, upscale department stores, restaurants, amazing street-food carts at night, underground malls and more. I recently stayed for 10 days at a hotel in the area and really enjoyed the location because of the activity.  The district has two main streets, one that starts at the Myeongdong subway station and the other at Lotte Department Store by the Euljiro 1 subway stop, exit 6. Though shops offer everything from clothing to jewelry, Korean cosmetics and beauty creams seem to predominate with hawkers sometimes standing outside, offering free samples to entice passersby to enter.  Side streets seem to go every which way, so it is easy to get lost. When that happened to me, I would look for two people in red uniforms. These signify men and women available to answer questions and give directions. At least one member of the pair speaks English. There are also tourist information offices around, where employees speak English, Japanese, Chinese and Korean.  When night falls, neon signs brighten the streets and food carts appear. Crowds descend on the area and walking almost comes to a standstill. Food items for sale include noodles, freshly squeezed pomegranate juice, kimchi pancakes, lobster, dumplings and the list goes on. Hundreds of people stand there and eat in the street. For those not into shopping, consider coming here at night to sample the food."
1002,2.0,"For me, I will not buy or eat at Myeongdong shopping street, I rather walk a few hundred metres away to Namdaemun Market to shop and eat.The different of the prices are 2000-3000 won for eating in a shop.And you can still bargain for shoes,clothing and idols merchandise stuffs here at Namdaemun.But of course if you want branded things you should go to Myeongdong😊"
1003,4.0,"Myeongdong must be the busiest street I have ever visited in Seoul. There were so many tourists and locals. Eating your street food might be quite a challenge especially with a stroller in tow because there's almost nowhere to stop.  There are many shops, street food stalls, restaurants. It is good to sample the food here but the prices are more expensive than in Hongik or in Ehwa."
1004,5.0,I enjoy staying in Myeongdong. Hang out and try lots of food along the walk. My friends said that you can get lots of sample of beauty product when you walk in Myeongdong Street . Actually it is not really true. The way they gave you their product promotion is like not sincere. They ask you to enter the shop not just giving away the product to try. I dont really like the way . I dont really need the beauty product anyway heehehehehhe.
1005,5.0,"Shops in this area cater to all genders and opens late into the night. From cosmetics, clothings to sportswear, from locals to intl brands. There is a food street full of mouth watering seafood and local food. Many good coffee shops and local restaurants around. The underground shopping is the best among all. For high end shopping one can go to Lotte and New World duty free. Service there was good and can get tax refund on the spot. This place is a must to visit when in Seoul."
1006,4.0,This area is food and shopping haven. Besides the street foods there are also lots of cafes and restaurants around. Lots of different brands of cosmetics to choose from. Each stores have their own ways to lure people inside to do some shopping in one way or another. Lots of cosmetic brands have more than one outlets. it seems like they are all over the place. Most tourist never miss this place when visiting Seoul. It's like a must visit place when you are in the area. Just bring lots of cash because it's hard to resist the aroma of foods.
1007,5.0,"myeongdong was only 10 min walk from my hotel , so i went there immidiately after chk in . it is super busy !! large crowds, neon lights and so many food places and bars to choose from . its great just for people watch and carnival atmosphere. i had dinner in a korean restaurant chicken galbi only $6 us so cheap and so good , they cook the food right in front of you chicken, rice , and kimchi . i went back there every night to hang around and eat , its good for shopping and also many money changers with reasonable rates ! do not miss when in seoul !"
1008,4.0,"Went here twice while i was in Seoul, street food heaven, plenty of sweets, seafood, meats and baked good available. surrounded by cosmetic shops and shopping centres. watch out though some hawkers use the halal sign without even knowing what halal is. but plenty of choice, defo worth a visit when in Seoul."
1009,4.0,Plenty of shopping and eating. I went with the rose gelato and fried shrimp. Also purchased a few beauty products (without skin whiteners). A few hours seems enough.
1010,4.0,"Plenty of streetfood, some are a bit more expensive than stalls you find near the university precincts."
1011,5.0,"Beware for ladies! There's so much of skincare products and masks for you girls to dive in. You can go broke by just spending 1 or 2 nights at this area. Of course, besides skincare, there's a lot more retails in this area. Various of food choices to choose from; restaurants or street food."
1012,4.0,Get off at Myeong-dong Station exit 6 and you can start shopping. There’re Korean brand beauty shops every 5 steps so you know one of the items you must get is face mask and make up. Besides that there are brand and cheaper stores selling clothes and few shops selling Korean snacks - great for souvenirs. Restaurants are plenty too. Tourist assistants are walking around to assist.
1013,5.0,"Our hotel was just at the end of this street, Amazing food and stalls. So much variety you can wander and try things for hours. Everything was clean all the vendors had fresh clean equipment and produce. There is a police station close and tourist police if you need them. It felt very very safe walking around at anytime and there are volunteers who speak English to assist if you need. Most vendors had a little English and we could make do with buying. If your in Seoul don’t miss out"
1014,5.0,"Many shops! Many restaurants! Sure have what you want! If you are done with the street, there are a few malls there too."
1015,3.0,Okay shopping. It seems there are at least four of every store in the relatively small/short shopping area.
1016,4.0,"one of the main reasons that I wanted to visit the city of Seoul was for the beauty products that the country is so famous for. The shopping street isn’t actually just one street - it’s multiple that veer off from the main one. You’ll find tons of different brand names, some you’ll recognise and some you won’t. I would heavily advise that you give the brands you don’t recognise a chance as some of the best products I picked up where from these places.  My advice would be to take a bag with you as you’ll end up with a ton of samples simply for looking around a store you are usually handed a free face mask or moisturiser sample and these can stack up pretty quickly. You’ll also as a visitor be eligible for a tax refund on products if you spend over 50,000 won as well as being given samples from the stalls for purchasing products.  At night while the beauty stores remain open, the night market comes to life with various different types of vendors. There’s some pretty amazing food on offer (the eggy bread was amazing) but you’ll also find some bags/phone cases / T-shirt’s etc. There was an abundance of knock-off supreme and off-white items available on the stalls."
1017,5.0,"There are 1000's of shops in the area. from reasonably priced to expensive.Name it ,it is there. On the weekends the streets transform into a night food market. I'm sure there were over 500 food stalls. If you are there over the weekend ...you must do it.."
1018,2.0,"Mostly all kinds of cosmetics and skincare products. Apart from this some shops employed very rude sales girls. When they try to speak to you in mandarin and you could'nt understand they will turn you away and also if you don't buy from them, they will snatch back the gifts from you !"
1019,5.0,This was a great place for night market for food. There was a huge array of shops there too. I ate there a few nights. I especially enjoyed the gimbap. I think South Korean sushi is lovely.
1020,3.0,"Even the night markets are somewhat not as exciting, especially so, that this is my 2nd visit within 6years. The stores selling beauty care products are aplenty, but was told by Korean friends that these aren't the cheapest. Nevertheless, one can find a few good eateries like abalone porridge, soy bean noodles and a few good deserts like Sulbing."
1021,4.0,We could stay half day in Myeongdong because there are various of shops and restaurants. The currency exchange rate in this district is in good rate. We could buy clothes and souvenirs here.
1022,5.0,"Sure, there is plenty of shopping to be done on the myriad of alleys and carts and small shops, but I'm going back again tomorrow night for the food. If you are a lover of street food, meat-on-a-stick and anything that can be fried or torched (see the pic), this is the place. Plenty of mom/pop/solo carts and, in the easily missed alleys within the alleys, are innumerable places to eat locally. The skewered dishes we had this even were in the 2000-4000 Korean Won range, making the evening greatly entertaining and a great value."
1023,4.0,"A street full of stores and shops with a wide varieties of food, clothing and cosmetics to view and buy."
1024,5.0,"There are hundreds of cosmetics shops of different brands in the area in which you can find everything you need! If you are a fan of Korean food, you will definitely enjoy the food both in the restaurants and from the stalls as well!"
1025,4.0,"Arrived at the area around 11 am , was wondering what was all the fuss about. By noon droves of people started appearing within an hour place was jammed packed. There are more stores selling cosmetics and skin products than anywhere I have ever seen . Every 3rd or 4th store was selling skin products. Food carts and hawkers started appearing on the streets. Literally every street had at least 8 to 10 Restaurants . Must for any visitor to be here."
1026,4.0,"Simply the best, an amazing place to shop non stop. So many gift and allsorts of food stalls many variety of restaurants and even designer wear shops. The list goes on... love it love it love it. Its a must visit for those who travel to Seoul."
1027,4.0,"Once getting out of the station, therr will be scene of shops lining up the streets. Each shop would play different playlist - some would sound familiar, some would not. This place is best for buying beauty care (there are too many brands to mention, but I would like to recommend nature republic which is next to station exit). In case you need new clothes, go buy one at either Uniqlo (the biggest branch store in Asia) or a shopping mall next to nature republic. The shopping mall has 3-4 floors: men's clothing on first floor, women's on second floor. There are gorgeous clothings to find in there though some might be in low quality (I am saying this because the one I bought was not sewed tight enough. It might be damaged if I am not careful enough). About the food hawkers, the price might vary depends on what you eat and in which hawkers you buy. Take an example... One gyeranppang (Korean egg bun) costs 2000 won while roasted lobster tail with melted cheese costs you 15.000 won (I actually doubt the price... Was not it too expensive? I need to cross check about it)"
1028,4.0,Shops and street foods galore. Don’t have your meal before you come here. Stuff yourself with the delicious street food that fill this place. Clothes are cheap as well.
1029,5.0,"When you go here, make sure that you have enough money to go on a shopping spree because you will spend on a lot of street food and a lot of skincare products! especially if you go gaga over those Korean trends."

1033,5.0,Alot of shops there. Alot of variety of shops especially make up and clotes for females. Food too. Recommended
1034,5.0,"I was prepared. I knew I was going to buy many facial products. In fact, I pre-booked extra 15kgs going back just for my new goodies! My 2 friends who weren't sure what to expect also ended up shopping as much as I did.  Myeondong is full of skin care brands left and right, as far as your eyes can see, as much as you can carry or afford. I really didn't notice much else like clothes, shoes, etc. I love all the freebies they give you for every purchase and how every sales personnel knows how to use the products they're selling.  Prior to my trip, I watched some YouTube videos on skincare products. I also read lists and blogs so I was armed with screenshots of what I wanted. I found most of them without much effort. I could've tried harder to find the others but I got distracted with Artbox and Daiso so it's all good.  Let's just put it this way, my 2 friends who were not as crazy with beauty products as I am said: We live in Innisfree. They're literally in Innisfree every day (we were in Seoul for 5 days) and sometimes, 2x a day. You can't help but consider, look, buy, consider, look, buy. Repeat. :-)  Be prepared. :-)  Tax refund until 1M Korean Won on each passport. Refund at the airport was very efficient (unlike in EU where there are long lines)."
1035,4.0,"It is easy to get to Myeong-dong by subway, there is a station right there. The streets are buzzing and you can buy just about anything!"
1036,3.0,"despite only staying 10 minute walk away from myeongdong I only seemed to be brave and go about twice during my whole 3 month long trip as i couldn't stand the constant crowds of people at all times myeongdong just seemed to be constantly busy. there never seems to be a quiet hour or quiet street. however, the shop are amazing and the amount of free samples i got just walking up and down the street was amazing i didn't even have to go in!"
1037,4.0,This place is full of vigrancy. Street stalls neatly lining up the streets. Starts on after 2pm. All sorts of local Korean delicacies. Expensive though but clean and delicious. Tons of beauty shops everywhere and speaks beautiful mandarin. Simple to locate. Cannot get lost.Recommend to go early winter as it was rather hot.
1038,1.0,"This area is heavily populated by Chinese tourists with large suitcases who sit in shops sending photos of items to their friends on Wechat. There's street food, but nothing you can't find in a less touristy area. My advice: avoid myeongdong like the plague - There's better places in Seoul for literally everything on offer here."
1039,4.0,"If you are interested in beauty products, Myeondong Shopping street and the nearby streets/alleys is the place to go. However, my advise is to bargain a lot, as not all the shops has fixed prices.You can also find a lot of good restaurants in the area."
1040,5.0,Myeondong is just fantastic to walk around with street stalls crazy shopping of all kind. Just love it!
1041,4.0,"We were in an apartment very close to the market. Very easy to access and on Friday full of life. We went on Saturday and closing at 23:00 so be careful. You can walk and smell and taste a lot of street food. Need cash for this. Everything is between 2.000 and 5.000 KRW, except the lobster 15.000 KRW. Try also the 32cms ice creams at 2.000 KRW. In one of the streets, you also have a Cat Cafe where an admission fee is required (KRW 10.000) with a drink included. It is an experience ."
1042,5.0,"If you're into Korean skincare, make up, fashion and snacks, you must definitely go to Myeongdong ! They have the whole area full of shops and stores."
1043,5.0,"In my view, Myeongdong is the must-visit place for the hundreds of restaurants, shops and night market stalls spread across 99 HA of land. From the exit of Myeongdong station, one must remember the route taken, not so much as not to be lost, but to explore every nick and hook of this shopping paradise in Seoul.  Street food served by night market stalls is expensive but not unaffordable. This is after all a popular and famous tourist spot. One advice is not to gobble up every food that intrigues you so that you won't regret not having any more capacity for delicacies 1 hour later.  The streets are straight and they criss cross one another. Many shops are duplicated selling cosmetics and skincare products, worth a buy since they are generally half the price compared to the home country of the tourists.  Myeongdong - one day is definitely not enough."
1044,4.0,"Everything you want for skin care, make up, clothes and more! Top names as well as local bargains. Sheet masks a particular winner."
1045,4.0,Super close to Insadong area where I was staying - constant buzz about the place and packed with clothes and cosmetics stores - also great street found around
1046,4.0,"Everything you could think of is here. Gives you a flavor of Korean cosmetics and street food. Busy and hot in the summer, take an umbrella."
1047,5.0,"We love this street - especially in the evenings when the weather was cooler. There's plenty of street food - name it; it's here: whether it's chicken or octopus, steak or crepes, it just seemed to be an endless supply of food and shops."
1048,4.0,Go for some excellent shopping and food. The food carts offer great variety and there are plenty of sitdown restaurants and cafes too
1049,3.0,"This is a shopping heaven especially for street food, cosmetics, clothing and shoes. You will find many shops packed during Saturdays. However, we had a bad experience where we were cheated by food seller who asked us to pay twice, once during the ordering and they made us pay again when the food was prepared. We were shocked that there was such a petty ""thief"" among those sellers who use this trick to get more money from foreign visitors."
1050,5.0,"I'll be honest, I'm not usually a ""shopper"" on vacation but I think this street converted me. It's a haven for anything and everything you could imagine - seriously, anything you're looking for at any price range, this place has got it! I personally found myself more drawn to stationary/home goods/Korean skincare stores. Even in the intense rain that was happening during my visit, this place was a pleasure to visit. Also, if you don't try the street-food (there is a street dedicate to this) you're missing out on one of the best experiences Seoul will give you. I tried out some tteokbokki, kimbap and found an organic milk based soft serve stand and they were all heavenly."
1051,4.0,"I love cosmetic, so this is heaven for me. I was there in August which was too hot n humid to shop during day time. Stores have AC but I prefer to shop at night time especially they have street food. Foods are not cheap IMO. And I am not sure if we are suppose to bargain for beauty supplies? Because I feel they are not that cheap compare to if I order online. Most store lures you with deals like buy 2 get 1 free and throw in bunch of samples. Or if you buy 500k krw they give you a small carry on, 1 million krw they give you a medium luggage to carry your purchase (I think that’s a great idea). And you see lots of people carry luggages around. I wish they have a beauty supply store where they sell beauty machine like derma pen, needle roller, LED light, etc.. .. because I couldn’t find one. Oliver young has blackhead removal machine but it is weak. I bought and tried once I got back to the State. It didn’t work well. Otherwise I highly recommend going to myeongdong shopping street."
1052,5.0,We loved this district on our short stay over in Seoul. The street food was to die for!  It’s easily accessible by the metro.
1053,5.0,"Too nice a place we went there everyday after lectures for SNU. The cathedral, blouses, toys, babies accesories ,food ,socks. The church is a must see as it is the first Catholic church built in Gothic style.Doota duty free with Line products for kids. Food is good esp at Migabon near the carhedral with their porridge n chicken soup."
1054,5.0,Fun shopping in this area. Lots of cosmetics stores. Low cost clothes and shoe shops. Some fun shops for kids with toys. Lots of food vendors on the street. Inexpensive restaurants.
1055,4.0,"Be sure to get a map from your hotel or the tourist info guides before wading into Myeongdong. You definitely get a sense of deja vu as you see nearly the same stores every way you turn.  Shopping: 1. Have a shopping list (with prices) before you go so you do not easily fall into sales traps! 2. There are discount coupons on a few Myeongdong shops and restaurants in the Visit Korea Committee site. I think the offers change regularly, and can be redeemed in specific branches. I've seen 10% off coupons on Banila Co. and Missha on the site. This is in addition to the tax refund you get once you reach the 30k won minimum. 3. The Myeongdong stores do not give out as much samples as I expected; I had to ask the cashier to give me samples as my purchase was being wrapped up. 4. Compare items/offers at the main street stores with items/offers at stores by the outskirts. By main street, I mean that road with the street food stalls that has Uniqlo at one end. I've seen discounts offered at an outskirt store that wasn't available in the main road store. I've also been allowed to choose items that went into a BuyX/GetX offer at an outskirt store, whereas the main road store only had pre-packaged bundles. 5. Read up on Korea tax refunds before your visit. Check the tax refund provider of the store before going in, or if the store directly gives you a tax refund after you present your passport at the cashier. It would be most convenient if the store gives you a tax refund directly; next convenient would be if all your tax refunds would fall under a single provider such as Cube Refund, Global Blue, etc. 6. For tax refund claims less than 75,000 won, getting refunds through the airport kiosks is a pretty quick process. 7. For shopaholics, there may be better offers in the duty-free store at the airport. There is also an online duty-free store where you can have packages delivered at the airport.  Street food: Our favorite was the egg bread stall! Location kept changing for the 3 nights we went there. Not all of the street food were hits: the gimbap stall was a disappointment. Bring cash with you before hitting the stalls. The first night, we looked at most of the stalls before choosing what to try, and took note of stalls where locals lined up.  Restaurants: As stated, there are discount coupons on a few restaurants available online. There are a lot of restaurants in the area. We didn't encounter any lines in well-known restos, but we did come in during off-peak hours.  Souvenirs: There's a stall selling character socks that would make a great souvenir!"
1056,4.0,Big tourism trap but many goos earieries and shopping variety with street performers. Very interesting for the tourist.
1057,4.0,We love Myeongdong at night. We went there 3 times when in Seoul last July. Love to shop in this area. We can even bargain at the street seller. My kids love the street food.
1058,5.0,You can have good shopping experience. Almost all the branded shops are there. Street food were amazing
1059,4.0,A lot of shop and various food can be found in this shopping street. You have to bargain the price in some shop in order to get cheap price
1060,4.0,The street market have many Korean brand cosmetic shops and sells various local street foods. A place definitely should visit when you are in Myeongdong.
1061,4.0,By far the highlight of this shopping area was being given free sample beauty products just for going into the store for a 10min browse. Bulk packs are easy to buy here and make great gifts for friends back home. There's lots of other clothing stores but they don't cater for Western sizing. A great place for people watching. Many different types of food to try. I had both the 32cm ice cream and the flower gelati from Milky Bee. The Rose flower ice cream is unmissable!!! Check out Art Box whilst you're there...it was a great shop full of everything and anything. Take your passport for instant tax refunds whilst you're here. Kpop merch available in the underground subway mall.
1062,5.0,"this place was full when we walked around on a hot summer day, very nice to walk around, a lot of shops and great restaurants. Definitely enjoyed myself here, watching local koreans shop and eat at their favorite places."
1063,4.0,"We were advised to shop around the Metro Hotel area. I found all sorts of new skin care products which I now use with good effect on my maturing skin. My beauty routine will never be the same. My sons bought clothes from the street sellers, and they’re of good quality. It was raining on and off and we did not stay long."
1064,5.0,"Visited this area almost every night during our 8 days stay in Seoul. Lots of very nice street food, restaurants and cafes in this area. Very lively and happening especially after the sun goes down. Must visit!"
1065,5.0,"You’ve got all your favorite cosmetic shops there, so keep an eye open and look for the best offers! They change all the time, even from one day to another so make sure to around before you make a decision to buy something! If you are a Kpop fan, there are a lot of kpop stores but kinda hidden so keep and eye open for them! (They are in basements or upper floors!)"
1066,4.0,"It was Sunday when i went to this street to look for souvenir for my family and friends after i found out that Dongdaemun Market closed on Sunday. Very crowded place with tourists and locals. The food were amazing to look but if you not into Korean taste, i won't recommend you to buy or eat it. The taste might disappoint you. I love food! Love to cook too. So it was not as i expected to taste and i waste money on it. But if you just don't care about money then go ahead and buy the food streets."
1067,4.0,"Came here specifically to look for cheap glasses, which I did not get, but it is a lively area to eat some street food and do some shopping. Before you start, get to an information office, there is one near Boots on the main street, and get a Myeongdong guide map of the area. Apart from the streets it tells you where different types of shops are, restaurants, toilets etc. They also have a Seoul Official Tourist Map, which I had not seen before, which has street maps of different tourist areas, very useful. Try and get it elsewhere at the start of your holiday if you can."
1068,5.0,It was indeed a shopper’s paradise for cosmetic products which Korea is famous for. The small streets were a little confusing but it was fun exploring the shops. A trip to Seoul is not complete without doing any shopping in this area.
1069,4.0,Great place to shop for facial masks! Lots of shops. Street stalls start to set up for business in the evening.
1070,4.0,Stayed at Myeongdong both 2 years ago and on our last trip. It's a great base to be as it's so lively and happening. There are also a few exchange places so very convenient. I am not big on shopping so wasn't interested in the cosmetic shops and the street food is quite samey and overpriced. The best thing about it is the vibe and convenience in getting to other places- the cable car to Namsan park is not too far away and it's a short walk to Namdaemun. It was nice to step out of our guesthouses and step straight into the energy of the area!
1071,5.0,"Lots of cosmetics, and street food. Street food is very very interesting though but its a bit pricey for street food."
1072,5.0,I walked downtown through Seoul and ended up in the smallest but most interesting street in the city. A great way to finish my trip after a long day of meetings. Lots of people. Lights. Energy. Food. Shopping. It will be my first stop next time.
1073,4.0,"This is a fun market to visit, however the prices need to be negotiated. They tend to be a bit high for fakes, but still worth a visit"
1074,4.0,I love this place it was so lively. with ppl and it had every thing you can ever ask for in a place like this. food is great. shops has a lot variety. a really pleasant place
1075,5.0,"Like to lose myself in that crazy market :-)))) You can find everything you want as little presents, souvenirs..."
1076,5.0,"Countless shops! Tourists, please bring along your passport and you get a refund right away. There's uniqlo and daiso in addition to your popular korean brands such as Innisfree, Etude house and laneige. Across the road there is Lotte duty free department store."
1077,4.0,"Must visit for all beauty lovers. Even if you're not interested in the cosmetics/skincare, visit if you have the time just to soak in the ambience. Would say beauty products are cheapest here, often with masks going for Buy 1 get 1 or Buy 2 get 1 with lots of freebies!!!  Nice street food though I'd say they can get a little overpriced...  Come with umbrella because when it rains, there is no shelter besides the shops."
1078,5.0,"There is a total diversity of shops and people in/on this street in Seoul. The heartbeat of Seoul is very evident there. We visited in the daytime and then the following evening. So many people, just happy to be there...as were we. The pulse can definitely be felt."
1079,5.0,"This street is not only for women but also for men who loves skin care products at a good price. Make sure to bring a large bag for convenience of carrying your products. Tip for first timers: Tax refund is available for purchases KRW30,000 and up. So cut the retail mentality for a moment and buy all the products you need at a single receipt.Some stores deduct the tax on the purchase but some give you a special receipt which you can encash at the airport. Credit cards are accepted. You have the option to buy in your local currency or in KRW.There's forex fee if you ask them to charge you other than KRW so buy in KRW and let your local card to the conversion 🤓. Some stores are hard to find like 3CE and Labiotte but with Google map it's easy(Just like playing Pokemon Go). Street foods are also a must try.Prices are reasonable. I like the hotcake w/sunnysideup egg😁CosRx,Klairs and other known products can be found at a special shop ALAND. RTW outlets like Uniqlo, Adidas and Nike are present. If you're into socks there's a large store where you can buy everything at KRW1,000each or 11pcs for KRW10,000(it's somewhere at hidden corner 😊). Cute stickers and stationery are inARTBOX at a good price 😁"
1080,3.0,"We spent one evening here, had shaved ice and some street food. Shaved ice was KRW 7900, a simple toast KRW 4500. Some simple chicken skewers KRW 3000 and cheese sausages KRW 4000. Fried idon KRW 5000. Small miserable portion. Didn't buy any beauty products or any souvenirs. We came here a day before our departure, because everyone says you haven't been to Seoul if you don't go to myeongdong. Nah, I wouldn't return to this area again if I'm back in Seoul."
1081,5.0,"We stayed in Myeongdong for our week in Seoul. Gull of action day and night. After exploring many other parts of this huge city we’re pleased we made Myeongdong our base. Very busy Fridays and Saturdays. Well worth trying some of the amazing street food vendors. Great fun, good memories from spending time in this part of Seoul."
1082,4.0,"Myeong dong is where you could get all the K-beauty products, then after tired of shopping, around 5 pm all the street food and some clothes vendors will start lining up on the main street. Nice to see all is happening in one place!  The shop staff could be quite pushy offering free mask to get you to their store and buy stuff. Some of food vendors not happy if you just take pictures without buying."
1083,4.0,"Myeongdong shopping centre is convenient to access, because it's close to the station, korean makeup and skincare are everywhere."
1084,4.0,"Spend a few days in Seoul, lots to do and Myeongdong district should definitely be on your list of to-do’s The food stalls stay till late and offer a great variety of traditional items over and above the many restaurants scattered all over the area. I would recommend to rather snack from the various stalls as opposed to filling up in one stop - you will regret if you did as you walk along! A few great rooftop bars around as well."
1085,1.0,"I had good experience when I visited Myeondong 2 years ago. This time, I re-visited this shopping street and was totally disgusted and disappointed! The shop staff were hostile and rude. Their customer service were bad too, especially when I asked for more of the same items. They were so unwilling to get the products which I wanted to buy and simply threw them into the basket I'm holding. Terrible service! Even the street stalls also with the similar attitude, and worse! I was choosing some items and the owner simply asked me not to touch it and chased me away! Goodness, I wanted to buy the items yet being chased away! My friend had the same experience too when she asked for new pair of earrings she wanted to buy from a shop and the staff don't even bother to look for it and told my friend that was the last piece. But when we return the very next day wanting to get some more earrings, we saw the same pair my friend bought displayed on the shelf! Will never buy stuff from those shops and from the street stalls again! Terrible experience and shun us away."
1086,5.0,Visited the shopping street where myriads of cosmetic items and fashion trend wear are available. My only challenge is the non English speaking sales people and the description of items only in Korean.
1087,4.0,Great street food (although not cheap at all because Korea is not a cheap country) but a bit disappointing for shopping as it misses variety and value for money overall. Worth doing for sure for the nice atmosphere.
1088,5.0,This is a fantastic shopping open market! Be prepared to barter! Best tip I can give has a bit in mind what you are looking for and price prepared to pay maximum. Have it translated into Korean and when you see what you are looking for show them your translation? Korean's are not for the most part English speakers! Look for shops are not afraid to show pricing. If they don't they have 2 prices 1 for locals and the other for stupid tourists. Many shops show we speak english. Have fun !
1089,4.0,"Heaven for shoppers, especially ladies who love Korean cosmetics and skincare products. I also like the street foods alot"
1090,5.0,"I took my teenager and toddler shopping here. You can sample all the products. The store clerks do not mind. There’s so many shops selling makeup and facial masks. I needed to do some research before we started. We like Etude House and Too cool for School. If you purchase a lot, the shops give you samples. Which is a great idea, since trying some of the facial cleansing samples, I went back to buy more products.  There’s a Forever 21 and two h and m stores here. We just popped in but didn’t buy anything.  There are also two Daisos in the area. One is in the basement of the Boots building. This one is small. The other Daiso is on the Main Street in a big building. I believe there’s 7-8 floors. You can get makeup brushes, stickers, nail glue etc at Daiso. The quality is pretty decent.  Tons of street food vendors. They come out after 2 pm. We didn’t try anything since the prices were a bit steep.  We really loved shopping here."
1091,4.0,"Definitely a place to checkout, even if you don't intend to buy anything, somehow you'll end up with something. Street foods are generally clean and reasonable delicious. Walk out of the main street and you'll find plenty of restaurants, convenience stores."
1092,5.0,"Very cool place, lots of shops and restaurants. Literally shop till you drop! In the evening, lots of street food too, very cool vibe!"
1093,4.0,"Yes, Myeongdong = street food, make ups (beauty products), accessories and clothing. It's a vibrant place especially at night. Hip crowd, bright lights. This place is just beside our hotel (Loisir hotel) so it's very convenient and great!"
1094,5.0,"A trip to Seoul would not be complete without a visit here. The night market offers a variety of street food, many of which are Muslim friendly and some even labeled halal. We enjoyed the grilled seafood and roasted yam"
1095,5.0,"You'll find multiple stores of common korean cosmetic brands including Banila Co.  Brands like Cosrx can be found in Aland.  For foreigners who spend above 30,000krw, you can get immediate tax refund when you produce your passport at payment. They may not always ask for your passport so you're better off producing it anyway.  The street food can get a bit pricey but it was enjoyable!"
1096,5.0,"If you like to buy Korea cosmetic, you can go here. If you are fans of ft island, cnblue, AOA and the others artist of FNC, you can go to the fnc wow, they sell cake and latte and others."
1097,4.0,"We were staying in Lotte Hotel Seoul and the Myeongdong market was right opposite the hotel. We went once in the evening to enjoy the street food stalls which start from 0500pm and enjoyed the atmosphere. We had also reserved the last day for exploring gthis market, but turned out that there's not much for those like me who are not into cosmetics and beauty products. I would have preferred to spend the time elsewhere, especially when we had already visited all other other popular markets in Seoul by then. Comparatively the nearby Namdaemun market has more character to it."
1098,5.0,"There is so much shopping to be done in Myeongdong especially if you are a K beauty fanatic. Every major brand is in the area so you can really stock up on all your favourites. Also, there are enough restaurants and coffee places to keep you entertained. Very touristy so if that's not something you are into, then this isn't the area for you. It can get pretty crowded and chaotic but thats part of the experience."
1099,5.0,"Shopping countless shopping and Countless people back and forth, lot’s of shops and the street food that start’s at 5 pm, good tip is bring or buy lot’s of water to have with you while going all trough the street food vendors and eating them. Bring a trash bag with you and lot’s of tissue or wet tissue to clean your hands in between vendors...and enjoy this area..."
1100,3.0,"When you came to Korea, it is a fun place to go. You can buy good cosmetics at very reasonable price. You can go to the department store, Lotte, I personaly like 新世界departmentstore. I love shopping on the basement floor at the department stores. good food, and easy shopping. But if you are an experienced visitor, Myondong might be little bit tiring."
1101,4.0,"Myeongdong, a shopping district heaven I would say. This is a must-go-to-place when you are at Seoul. From fashion to food, to cosmetic and cafes, this is like a one stop point!  Had the latest trend food - Issac Toast as part of our breakfast and there are 2 outlets at Myeongdong. The one which is always long-queued, is located near Days Hotel, facing road. So we headed to the one inside which queue is 3 times shorter.  Had porridge as our breakfast at 多味粥 and it is located at a basement storey.  We had our lunch at 明洞饺子 and their noodle is really yummy.  These restaurants you many use google map to find them.  Do remember to bring a bag pack with you if you have a long shopping list.  Cheers Jazlyn"
1102,4.0,"there's many of the same cosmetic shops in all over myeongdong. Some of the quieter ones don't got salesperson outside waving freebies - so you might wander a bit further to another outlet of the brand u are looking for. There isn't much shopping for clothes to do here, and some of the eateries vicinity feel more of Chinese-ish than korean-ish. So if you are looking for authentic Korean food, choose wisely."
1103,5.0,"This is the main place for shopping, tourist-trap kinda place, food everywhere!!! During the day, it looks like a regular street with lots of shopping stalls, then around 4pm to late at night, the street food event happens. On average, street food costs $4-5.. The stores are the same on the next few streets as you walked through the entire Meyondong areas, lots of cosmetic shops, they are offering pretty much the same deals. There is Paris Baguette, McDonalds, Daiso, minimart, H&M, Forever 21, Line Friends, lots of restos and more shops within shops!!!"
1104,5.0,"Great place to buy beauty products. They give a ton of samples with each purchase. Beware though, as some items are much more expensive than Hong Kong. There are also some trendy street wear shops. Mostly went there to enjoy the street food. After a while the stalls just keep repeating with the same offerings. The grilled lobster with cheese, baked cheese and egg bread were our favorites."
1105,4.0,"According to my search and read reviews the one and only decent shopping street of Seoul. Lots of cosmetic shops, local street food stalls , import and local brand fashion and clothing shops etc"
1106,3.0,"Visited the night market of Myeong-dong and found that food and goods are no longer cheap like before. And the food offered are just repetitions, u can see the it repeats every 10 stalls..... It's getting boring in Myeong-dong"
1107,3.0,Lots activties but roads are not even and i had a sprain.  Lots of street food to try!  Don't feel it is an ideal place for elerly.
1108,5.0,"This place is simply awesome for street food. Lobster tail, potato twists, shrimps, scallops, chicken skewers, you name it. Vibrant and lively, but full of tourists. Must visit nevertheless!"
1109,5.0,"Great place to come shop, specially during the evening. Happening market with decent open food market and Shopping ( for ladies only though) available. Even a stroll during evening is worth its while.  DO NEGOTIATE HARD otherwise move on to next shop. full chances that next shop will reduce prices on bargaining. Enough shops available for similar brands."
1110,5.0,"What a trip, you could just people watch here all day long. You get true local prices here, a long walk around and you’ll find just about everything, and then some"
1111,5.0,"I love the street food here but its full of mainland china tourists and i believe because of that, the locals avoid this area. What puzzles me is the sheer number of multiple same-brand shops in this area. I think i saw 3 Zara shops, 5 Innis Free & about 10 shops with more than 2 stores within each corner of the street. I wonder how they stay in business."
1112,4.0,"Visited the area over several days and found the area had a lot of choice for both shopping and restaurants. The staff selling face masks at every second shop can be a little daunting as they can be aggressive. They offer free samples but if you don't go into the shop, they take them from you. You can find many beauty product shops here as well as all the international branded chains. In the evening the food stalls come out and these are great and offer a variety of cuisines and all relatively inexpensive."
1113,4.0,Shopping heaven for clothing and cosmetic. Lots of restaurant and street vendor as well. Very busy at night time.
1114,5.0,"The streetfood selections are abundant. Clean because we've been here twice and never had diarrhea. Some are affordable and please avoid the 10,000 won clam with cheese not worth your money. But their 1,000 won sweet potato and 3,000 won gyoza was super worth it. Be prepared to go against a throng of people. Not stroller friendly, make sure you have a sturdy stroller and keep an eye on your children, they could wander. But overall good. Your seoul visit would not be complete without this."
1115,5.0,most important one must know the night market starts at 4pm..there will be many stalls selling street food and souvenirs tshirts etc.uncountable cosmetic shops here eg face shop innisfree and missha etc..all giving great promotions and free samples.the concealer i bought from etude house there cost 7sgd cheaper than in spore..can buy face masks as gifts as there is always buy 10 plus 10 and price is filthy cheap.
1116,5.0,"It is very bustling at night with so many people, a lot tourists. Street food is good but need more variety I think. Shopping is a must-do and there is sale everywhere. Beauty products are a must-buy."
1117,5.0,Even if you don't shop you should go check out the cool stores and street food. If you are shopping it has everything you need!
1118,5.0,We spent wayyyy yo much time here. It's a busy area with lots of cosmetics and clothing stores. I do find that some prices (mostly clothing) are slightly higher than other non-touristy areas. Lots of street food and restaurants too. It opens till 10pm. Definitely a good spot to hang out at night after visiting all the palaces during the day. Be ready to receive free masks/samples ;)
1119,4.0,Myeong-dong shopping street is the place to go for everything you may want especially in brand clothing. This is a very modern area of Seoul and not where you would typically go to see a traditional street market. The fashion can be a bit on the higher end but a definite place to go to shop for clothes.
1120,5.0,"Korean is known for beauty products and fashion, when it comes to clothing. I like their style, a European and American inspired clothes. Their taste of clothes quite similar maybe because they have the same 4 seasons in a year. There's a variety of clothes to choose on, can bargain as well but don't ask to low. Don't forget to make an spectacles for yourself also, coz they do it very fast and a variety of choices for frames for their fashion taste. Give yourself a try!😉"
1121,4.0,Lot of shops to choose from ranging from high end to more affordable stores. We enjoyed the experience and lots of restaurants nearby for a rest in between shopping.

1130,4.0,"If you are looking for facial creams and products, this is the place to go to. Myeongdong Shopping street whiih can easily be reached by the Seoul Metro and extensive network of buses is always a welcome place. We were overwhelmed by the shear number of shops and 'clinics' offering the advise on facial and general beauty products at very reasonable prices."
1131,4.0,We walked around here eating some of the street food. There are several things to try. The retail consists of a lot of beauty product stores and a few clothing stores. There are also a lot of restaurants to choose from. When I have gone in the evening or the weekend it has been really crowded and difficult to walk.
1132,5.0,"Good for those who are looking for facial products and stuff. Bad for those who dislike crowds. In general a good place to spend the night, shop closes later here as compared to other areas"
1133,4.0,"although lots ""free sample of face-mask"" salesperson will trying to drag you into their shop and rip you off."
1134,3.0,The seller from the shops are trying too hard to get you into their shop! Even grabbing by the hand. Didn't like this area at all.

1136,4.0,"This part of town is insane! You can find any and every beauty product known to man in addition to nearly any kind of street food. Blow torched lobster and clams, anything fried on a stick, chocolate covered fruit, things you have seen before and things you have not. Definitely worth a few hours to eat and shop your way through these streets. Bring cash!"
1137,1.0,"Heard so much about Myeongdong so i stayed in one of the hotel there on the last 2 days of my 10 days trip in Seoul, but was disappointed. The area with alleys of shopping but mostly skincare and cosmetic shops are like night market because of all those repetitive food stalls outside. Too crowded and DIRTY. Not my type of shopping experience. Not to mention prices are not cheap but certain items. Next time I will not stay in that area anymore. Prefer to stay in Gangnam.  *The hotel I stayed in Myeongdong was GOOD though."
1138,5.0,"We went to Myeongdong during the sale season. So many shops offering real sale from skin products, shoes, bags. Enjoy the street food as well as restaurants offering superb Korean food. Experience a visit to a dog cafe. Amazing dogs."
1139,5.0,"We stayed at Lotte Seoul which is about 5 minutes away from here so we came here every day. There is so much to buy and see. Make up shops everywhere with good quality cheap makeup which is made in Korea. Restaurants everywhere, we had lots of really good cheap meals here everyday. Korean BBQ is so delicious and so good for you. Especially when it’s -7 outside and you’re inside a restaurant eating delicious beef stew.  Early afternoon they bring the market stalls out with vendors selling everything from food to phone covers or doggie costumes!  We loved it. Very safe with lots of variety. A must visit."
1140,4.0,"When you go there make sure you bring cash with you or have your foreign exchange already done. There’s lots of options of tasty street foods to choose, it was an awesome experience especially the shopping part .. If you use card often it is very accessible, you can use your visa card or debit in paying and you’ll get a tax exempt or refund thing that they called if you show your passport paying with your card ..and they will give you a percentage sale also.it was a wonderful experience indeed I want to experience it again. My Korean friend help me understand and explained stuff while I was there. And people are very nice and friendly."

1143,3.0,"After hearing the early evening Mass at the Cathedral, it was a nice walk with a number of street food. Might be a bit pricey at first glance but all the prices of street food are the same wherever you are in this district. Grilled lobsters, shell fish, corn on the cob, strawberries, waffles etc."
1144,4.0,"I don’t have the shopping gene. My hotel in Seoul is in the heart of Myeongdong though, so I thought, when in Rome. Aside from the big name stores, a lot of street stalls popped up, as the sun went down, selling some delicous street food and lots of cheap gloves, coats, bags and the like. The area also has lots of phone covers, K-Pop swap cards and gifts to take home that are sometimes required when you’ve taken a holiday. You should be able to kit out the relatives and friends, co-workers etc. here while also buying some quality stuff from the Doc Marten or Adidas or other named brand shops. If you must go shopping this is a pretty painless place to do it."
1145,4.0,If you're into makeup and stuff. This place has every possible Korean brand you can think of to stock up or replenish your makeup. It's a street food paradise at night and has several good cafe and food located all around the area.
1146,4.0,this place is all about SHOPPING. you can get anything from here. lots and lots of makeup though. they offer freebies for you to get inside the store. once your there they would definitely be in your face for you to buy and buy. soo beware. the temptation to buy another pair of lipstick is just too great. but overall it was a nice experience to try when your in Seoul. visit it amd see for yourself. 😃
1147,5.0,"This is the place for all ladies to young girls. You can find all types of House own brand to world class brand in Myeongdong. You will never want to leave this place early after your shopping. Because there is plenty of nice street food after dark or before 5pm. I should say. This place is so lively from morning to dark. Do your homework first before searching for your products. Otherwise, you will feel lost in there. Too much to choose from."
1148,4.0,Went there 2nd week of Dec 2017 and my 3rd time visiting Myeongdong. This time lesser crowd and easier to navigate. Really enjoy it to the max !
1149,3.0,"There are many restaurants and food peddlars here. Try the giant yogurt softserve, it's delicious! There are also lots of clothes stores like Forever 21, H&M etc...and places to buy food and snacks, not to mention a few street stalls selling purses, sunglasses, bags, shirts so you can bargain with them. It's generally very busy most of the time but the atmosphere is good."
1150,4.0,"Many skin care products boutiques in Myeongdong area and almost every street in Myeongdong, you can find at least an outlet of the the common brands such as Etude House, Innisfree, etc. Most of these brand has many indoor promotions on their items which changes almost every week. It was interesting to walk along the street as many of these boutiques promoter will give free mask or samples to attract passer-by into the store. And many free skin care samples were given when you purchase items from them."

1152,4.0,They have lot's of good street food vendors among all the beauty stores. There are several department stores nearby.
1153,4.0,Worth a visit. However the street food and souvenirs are more costly. Great place to get beauty products and get many freebies
1154,4.0,"OK, I like to shop. I rank Insa-dong my favorite, but this nearby quarter is good as well, and since it's a short walk away, why not wander it as well?"
1155,5.0,"Every few step, you’ll find an Etude house, Innisfree, face shop, laneige. It’s basically the heaven of Korean MakeUp and skincare shopping. All of the masks are on permanent discount as well.  Contrary to believe, they are much more stingy with samples already.  Most of the sales assistance speaks Korean, Chinese or English. Will definitely recommend coming and stocking up on masks. Need an entire day to shop here."
1156,5.0,"This is definitely one of the best places in Seoul, the street is just full of energy, you can get to feel how active Seoul is. The street offers endless options of shopping stores, both delicious and cheap street food, a true paradise for the gourmands among us :)"
1157,5.0,"I can spend hours just to walk around and visit every shop. Too much attraction in here. The food street definitely good, all of it. And if you want to buy some snacks, you may visit the LALA MART, it’s has the cheapest price so far and you may find anything there. Korean cosmetics, yes you may find all the cosmetics brand here, etude, innisfree, nature republic, the saem and so on. If you have enought time, you can visit more than one store of etude in here because in my experience they have different stock on each store. Myeongdong also a place for sneakers hunt :) besides the ABC mart, there’re some other sneaker stores. Also, it has the big LINE store with the huge brown doll in the front of the store, where you can take photograph but you have to stand in the provided queuing line first."
1158,5.0,"My favourite shopping area. Shoes, skincare, street foods, snacks, clothes, etc. You can find almost anything here."
1159,4.0,This is the market that you must visited in Seoul. Dont miss it because you gonna love it and will miss it when you leave Seoul.

This market is an example of a success market in attracting tourists all over the world. Visit Seoul and you must experienced this Unique Street Night Market. Never miss Myeong Dong whenever you are in Seoul.
1160,4.0,"A shopping paradise lined with restaurants, street foods, beauty product, sports & fashion shops. Free masks & samples giveaways have been largely reduced but you can still shop around for the best bargain. On our first night, we dined at one of restaurant on the 2nd floor which showcased ginseng soup & chicken stew. Big Mistake. The food was bland & tasteless. Service was rude & the crew keeping pushing us to order more dishes with larger portions. When we decided to order medium portion which turned out to be more than enough for the 4 of us, the staff sneered while taking our order. We noticed there were no locals dining at the restaurant, all were tourists lured by the pretty signboards downstairs. On our remaining days in myeongdong, we tried other restaurants in the vinicity & enjoyed great dinning experiences. Just this one that we did not enjoyed."
1161,4.0,Another shopping paradise in Seoul. You can find almost everything here. There are so many store for you to choose and so you can compare the price for a similar product to get the best price. You need to be intelligent shopper here because the price for a same product may be vary with another place offering the same product in other store.
1162,4.0,"All kind of stuff can find here. But not cheap, compare with dongdaemun . Must be intelligent shopper. No negotiation here. What i found out there, Uniglo sold the cloths more expensive then malaysia."
1163,4.0,My wife went out and bought enough of skin care products to last a while in just an hour. She is not a cosmetic person. Worth a visit for ladies. Prices and variety is the main reason.

1170,5.0,"Of all the shopping streets in Seoul, in our opinion- this is the best.  Its huge, lively, great atmosphere, always crowded & have wide& good mix of products & food outlets.  And it is centrally located in Seoul with easy access everywhere. There is a big & nice Lottle Mart nearby as well. We always stay here in our visit.  For ladies, this is a paradise for cosmetics. All the Korean cosmetics brands are here. Each with multiple shops as well ( believe they are franchises as prices/promo do vary from store to store here).  There are alot of street food & street vendors as well.  Loved this place."
1171,5.0,myeongdong is a shopping mecca ...everything you need you can find here particularly Kpop merchandise..ive been to myeongdong 5 times during my last trip and i still end up buying a lot after each trip..the shops here offer a lot of discounts and freebies so one really gets enticed to purchase... myeongdong at night is different during daytime but both are worthy of visit. myeongdong has been used as location for korean dramas and variety shows and i got excited seeing those.... never leave seoul without going to myeongdong
1172,4.0,"There are lots of shops selling facial product like laneige,innisfree,tony moly,saem etc and they do have lota of offer and the price are much more cheaper compare to my homecountry. You can also try their local street food here too. But it only start to open in the afternoon. There are choicea of restaurant in the area too."
1173,4.0,"Loads of brands, loads of choices, loads of items .... loads of street food and loads more. Its a combination of high street fashion and a street shopping for the common people. Latest fashion on apparel, shoes, tshirt, branded or even local items , all are here.  If you are up for it, loads of street food traders will be just around every corner. Baked lobster, Baked Muffin with eggs ( this is my favourite item) and local korean street food are amongst the many many choices being offered here.  As for cosmetics, it is a heaven for those who loves to shop for skin care, facial care and anything to do with make up. Women will definitely loves it here.  Its a must if you come to Seoul , Korea."
1174,4.0,"This street will help keep the visit to Seoul alive. The street has great shopping, whether it is street shopping or mall shopping. Street is filled with great local Korean street food - which are clean, hygienic and tasty. Never a dull moment walking along this street."
1175,2.0,"The most overrated shopping street in Seoul. It’s only great if you are a Korean beauty product & Korean big names fashion fan. There are many fancy street food at night but they overcharged. It’s 2-3x more expensive than other place. If you are looking for bargain buy and souvenirs, I would suggest Namdaemun Market which is just 15mins walk from Myeongdong."
1176,5.0,"If your looking for something, anything, you will probably find it here. Huge variety of clothes, souvenirs and pretty much everything. Be sure to go into some of the buildings for lots more stalls and shops. Found they don’t barter much, maybe 10-20% but prices reasonable anyway. Leave enough time to explore."
1177,2.0,"Myeongdong is an amazing place for shopping (especially beauty products) and the evening vibe feeling is so good. There are banks if you need to withdraw money, tax free refund machines and counters so you won’t need to do in at the airport, restaurants and street food everywhere and very many people but no worries about getting pick pocked.  However, most of the shop clerks (not street food vendors or street sellers) acted like I murdered their dearest pet and gave crap service. They barely gave response or tried to communicate, did not look at you when talked with, no smiles EVER. Imaging a shop clerk acting like you are a burden they are trying to get rid of."
1178,5.0,If u 1st time coming to Seoul then u should stay around this area. Great atmosphere during night when there’s a lot of shops and stalls selling great stuffs and foods also! U can try all the street foods here while shop til you drop.
1179,5.0,My favourite street to walk and snack! Lots of yummy Korean street snacks and many cosmetics stores!
1180,4.0,"We thought Myeondong would be a bit overrated but we still put it down to our must-try food hunting list. No regrets. I wont deny it was fairly crowded but it was one experience worth going for.  As fellow Muslim travellers, my husband and I managed to find few halal stalls out of many that is available. Although there were few non halal ones (selling meat) majority were just seafood and one selling halal kebab.  We went twice and took our time to try them out while some were quite delicious some were so-so. I particularly love their sweet delicacies namely the sweet peanuts with eggs hot cake. However out of the two stalls i tried, one of it tastes better than the other. So look out for the ones that has more patrons, lol.  The street is full of beauty product shops as well as clothes so you may want to check it out. These beauty product shops will always include sample giveaways too. Majority clothes were quite small but I manage to find bigger baggy tops to fit."
1181,4.0,"Myeongdong, where the night is always young. Somehow time stops as you troll the streets and lanes of beauty shops, fashion outlets and food carts. The bright lights, the food smell, the touters' chants, the hawkers' showmanship, the heavy human traffic - the experience is multi-sensory! Landmarks don't quite work here because there are dozens of the same beauty shops at every lane that the streets all look almost the same as you turn the corner.  Worth visiting for the multi sensory experience but it doesn't mean the purchases (including the food) are gentle on the pockets."
1182,4.0,This place would be a shopping heaven for ladies who are fascinated with beauty products. There are many shops selling beauty products at a price that is way cheaper than Singapore. The are also make shift street stalls selling traditional Korean food at night.
1183,4.0,"We go there for street photography mainly, many cosmetic shops worth going and different brands shops. There is halal restaurant offers good taste"
1184,5.0,"Very good bargain shopping and also branded shopping,especially clothes and shoes. Too good for street food too"
1185,4.0,"Myeingdong is perhaps the most popular tourist area in Seoul. It can be easily accessed by metro. The market is big with a few big shopping malls (Lotte, Lotte Young Plaza, Shinsegae), Zara, Forever 21, numerous shops, restaurants, cafes, snack bars, street food vendors and more.  Most of the stores sell cosmetics, clothing, electronics. The street food is the major attraction. There are food vendors on both sides of the streets selling a vast variety of food. Some of the food you probably haven't seen before.  Occasionally, you see 2 people wearing red uniform with an ""i"" in front. They are the ""information center"". They are extremely helpful and speak fluent English and can answer any question about the area. I don't see any public washroom in the area but you can ask the ""information dual"" to show you the way.  The place is very vibrant and always busy. Just come here to be with hundreds of people is an experience."
1186,3.0,This place has so many shops selling similar merchandise that it makes one wonder how they stay in business. Be prepared to walk a lot as there is much to see.
1187,5.0,"I am european, but the shops are good value ( apart from electronics) but for the larger person there are no choices."
1188,4.0,This district is very busy with shoppers. You literally can find anything here. Street foods are also available here.
1189,5.0,"Hundreds of shops mostly cosmetics and apparels! Lots of restaurants too so easy to grab food during your shopping. At night, there are street vendors that make the area livelier. Try those street foodS from skewers to local snacks and delicacies. Subway myeongdong station or euljiro 1."
1190,5.0,"Great place for shopping and eating out, Night time there are food carts around too. Lotsa hotels around. Convenient."
1191,4.0,"There is a lot to see and buy, can't finish in a day. You can find some similar items in different shops, so compare before you buy. Avoid taking free samples from cosmetics and skincare shops as most of them will literally pull you in to their shop and take back the ""free sample"" if you did not buy anything. Food in Myeongdong streets are mostly over-priced. Ask the price before purchasing food as some sellers would raise the price if they know you are travellers."
1192,2.0,"Lots to see in this area but mostly all the same - clothing, street snacks, and cosmetic shops. It all sounds fun except almost all the products being sold are basically the same. Everything is more expensive than the rest of Seoul, so that was a huge turnoff for us. I would not recommend shopping here, a quick walk-through would do it if you've got time to waste. Families with children - watch out for large crowds and loud noises."
1193,5.0,"Shopping for beauty products? Well there are at least 5 from where I stand. And they all beckon. Snail cream, animal facial masks, you name it. Packed a dozen or so. And those socks. Just had to get them for my wife, daughter and granddaughter!"
1194,5.0,"There are lots of street foods along myeongdong and many places where you can have Korean BBQ. This place is ALIVE during late afternoon to late at night.

1195,5.0,Love Myeondong and street food . Although I am not a shopper type these streets have a different character and a must do in Seoul. Go there after 7 or 8 pm.
1196,4.0,"From fashion items to kpop items to cosmetic products in the morning then, street foods by late afternoon 'til the evening, you better prepare your money to fly away."
1197,5.0,If you want street food at night this is the place to be. So much variety and choice. Bustling with energy and atmosphere. Tons of cosmetic stores too for bargain buys. Gives a good sense of Seoul at night. It's much more subdued during the day.  My favourite area in the city
1198,4.0,"Great shopping atmosphere and home to Seoul' s first department store Shinsegae...beautiful store with an amazing higher end food court, market and good hall. The street good vendors lend to the atmosphere...great for people watching"
1199,4.0,"Large shopping street with many different shops and goods, especially for clothes and cosmetics. Also there are quite many places to have something to eat. For people who have the taste of shopping in traditional way rather than shopping centers."
1200,5.0,This is a must visit. Lots of shopping and incredible amounts of new foods to try. My wife and I really enjoyed this area. it felt very safe as well.
1201,5.0,"A "" must do"" in Seoul simply to experience all the different food stalls from pancakes to dumplings to octopus ... favourite was the meat filled korean dumplings ... awesome  And as opposed to the sights often seen in asian cities like Thailand , nothing seedy or concerning ... would recommend to do if you are Seould"
1202,4.0,"This is definitely a tourist trip, but also a local trip. When you think of visiting Korea, you think of cosmetics, fashions, shoppings, etc. This shopping block is all of them on repeats. After 5-10 steps, you see another facial shop selling masks, cosmetics shops, clothing shops. There are also some good restaurants and street food options. At night, there are food vendors also selling street foods. An interesting fact about Korea is that they strongly encourage visitors to take people and upload them online. There is a big Line Friend shop that people would line up and take pictures. Overall, it is an interesting experience."
1203,5.0,"This is one of our must-visit places in Seoul. It was as what we expected - lots of shops, restaurants, street foods, ... and people. Since our hotel was 15-minute away, we went here everyday - morning, afternoon, and every evening.  Many of our must-eat restaurants are also in Myeongdong. We had pan-fried chicken, dumplings, noodles, BBQ, ice cream. There are also many great coffee shops here. If you know how to shop, you can also find bargains for stylish and trendy clothes.  And ... there are lots of people here."
1204,4.0,Different than other shopping spots in Asia - for locals but tourists are seen as well. Have a great time ion this great city
1205,3.0,"The area around the cathedral is very trendy but still very Asian. The market has this particular ambiance with all kind of local street food and tourist stuff. Lots of stores in the area too including a huge Lotte. It's central area for a stay in Seoul. Close to the metro station, the city hall, and touristic attractions."
1206,4.0,"If you like shopping or have time to kill, this is the place for you. Hundreds of shops and restaurants are within this shopping area. If you prefer street food, you would not be disappointed to try the taste of local street food. As it is located in the city centre, it is easy to go there by taking metro; do not drive there as you would have difficulty to park your car."
1207,4.0,"I came here just because I know this area is famous, but really and truly you should only come here if you need makeup, skin care products, or the like. There are SO many stores selling all kinds of products for skin; I think I saw over 200 different brands of face masks that day. It was also hot and very crowded, so prepare for that as I'm under the impression that it's generally like that. There were people on the streets giving out samples too in an attempt to get you to come into their stores. They'll particularly target you if you're a foreigner, so be prepared to say ""no thank you"" in Korean if you want to politely and not ""noobishly"" turn them down. Overall, it's a cool place. If you're in Seoul I definitely recommend going just to check it out, especially if you want to buy makeup or face masks or something like that. There are some restaurants there too, as well as coffee shops so you can also stop for food or a snack if you need to. Not to mention, Myeongdong is pretty central to the city - my friend and I walked to Namdaemun market from there, as well as Namsan tower in the evening, and it was a really nice walking day (so wear close toed shoes). The subway is also close, and the area where you get off the subway right next to the big Myeongdong market area is also nice and has a Lotte Mart, a Daiso, and a bunch of other stores there too. It's a very nice place to visit :)"
1208,3.0,"If you love to shop and do not mind of the crowd then this is a place to visit. A heavy crowded and busy place. Most of the streets are narrow and watch out for the cars passing by. A lot of beauty products, retail stores, street food carts and restaurants. Foods are expensive though in this area."
1209,5.0,"I prefer going to Gangnam for shopping, but if you're looking for that good ol shoulder to shoulder experience, check this place out. Might be a little crazy but it's still fun!"
1210,4.0,I only breezed through here but it was super overwhelming. Definitely a bargain shoppers paradise. Lots of variety.
1211,4.0,"I loved that our hotel was right next to Myeongdong! It is a busy, exciting shopping/eating/entertainment area. I was surprised that almost every other store was for cosmetics and skin care items. I guess that's really big in Korea. What tickled us was the delicious street food from the vendors with their carts who came out just about when the sun went down. Fresh fruit, juices, smoothies, grilled butter lobster, octopus, conch shells, chicken, barbecue meats, egg puff pastries, 15 inch ice cream cone swirls, roasted chestnuts and sweet potatoes,and even spiral cut potatoes (and hot dogs in a spiral potato!)...We tried everything and they were all delicious and fresh. The whole area is festive and all lit up. This is a must-do while in Seoul!"
1212,4.0,"Nice place for wandering around. Plenty of shops, restaurants and cafes. A lot of vendors. A lot of opportunities for shopping around and having a delicious food. Do not miss the flowering ice-creams."
1213,4.0,Great place to get street food and cheap souvenirs. People watching was also enjoyable. Very crowded area with lots to see.
1214,4.0,"Myeongdong streets are perfect for shopping and watching people. We spend five days in the city and found several streets closed for traffic but open for Vendors for their merchandise. Activity starts at mid-afternoon/early evening until past midnight. Korean made products are in abundance, especially beauty and other related items. Of course Food and more food are available, very entertaining just to walk around and see the variety of food and merchandise available."
1215,3.0,"when I was a child, Myong Dong Street was for every body. but recently, the shop focused on Only Chinese visitor. some snack and street food are too expensive to eat.  Pls Don't eat Street food and Don't buy anying in MyongDong. just eye shopping only. you had better shopping local shop in another area."
1216,4.0,"2 years ago there were lots of Mainland Chinese tourist, too crowded and you can't really enjoy shopping! Also the staff are more cater for Chinese tourist - they can only speak Korean and Mandarin but not English!  Still lots of cosmetic shops along the street but at least this time the staff are not that pushy, and more friendly!"
1217,5.0,"I've started taking an interest in Korean skincare and makeup in the last couple of years, and Myeongdong always came up as a ""must visit"" area for that kind of thing. I didn't have as much time for shopping here as I would have liked (just one evening, that was not enough for me), but it's worth it. Every Korean cosmetic brand (and lots of Western, I think some other Asian brands too) has a shop (or five) here. Be sure to shop around and track what you're doing, as one shop to the next might have totally different promos (in the same brand - ex: one Etude House might have a huge promo on masks, but you walk down the street and a different Etude House won't have the mask promo but a promo on foundation or something). I actually liked shopping in the Ewha district a little more, because it wasn't as hectic and there were still lots of options for cosmetics and fashion (I think the prices were better too).  There's tons of fashion stores too, including a nice Uniqlo. A lot of brands have flagship shops here, you can browse for hours. There was even a Samsung Fashion store. Since we were only here for one evening, I'm not sure about restaurants in the area, but there is plenty of street food to be had, and that's what we snacked on while we shopped.  I definitely recommend coming here if you want to shop for branded fashion or cosmetics, but if you want more of an ""indie"" feel (and you are looking for women's fashion) I would recommend Ewha. Meyongdong is also not a good place if you can't handle large crowds."
1218,5.0,So lively and vibrant with so many pictures and songs you can hear of Kpop and kdrama actors if you are into it. Cheap buys. the giveaways for the beauty shops are not given unless you go inside.
1219,5.0,"You must walk up and down the streets of Myeongdong as they are akin to the night street stalls of Hong Kong. Very lively, entertaining and exciting."
1220,5.0,"This is a hectic area of Seoul which is a magnet for tourists. Narrow streets, packed with shoppers lined with food stalls and shops selling beauty products, Myeongdong is an extreme shopping experience! Not for the claustrophobic... this is an terrific area to pick up the latest in Korean cosmetics and youthful fashions (don't expect to be allowed to try everything on, some shops have a no-trying policy). Wandering the narrow streets is great fun, around every corner you see something unexpected (foot high ice cream cones anyone?) English and Chinese are widely spoken.  Things to buy: glasses (lenses can be fitted in an hour or so for many prescriptions), face masks and cosmetics (look out for the sales people offering free samples as you enter the shop), K-pop products (socks featuring G-Dragon anyone?!)  Things to eat: sugar dipped potato chip spirals on a stick, lobster with cheese (really!), squid, ice cream sandwiches, fried chicken. anything which is calorific, delicious and of dubious nutritional value.  To avoid: weekends are really, really busy!"
1221,5.0,"This market is one of the best and largest market in Seoul. You will find all type of shops here including cosmetics, clothing, food, etc.."
1222,5.0,It's truly a shopping paradise not only for ladies with so many cosmetic but also for men as well. Take the sky train Myeongdong shopping street and everything could be found from here. Noted to look for shops that have promotion / discount items
1223,5.0,"full of shops of all sorts and stalls, the food stalls are a must try and very reasonably priced, everyone speaks english and is extremely kind and accommodating"
1224,4.0,"I enjoyed being part of the scene which I have always read about! Can find almost every other brand of Korean skincare and cosmetic product here - most of the major brands have at least 2 outlets. It is totally a shopping heaven for me as some of the brands and products are not commonly found back home. Laneige products are definitely a great deal after tax refund and the discounts given! While most shops are not as active in giving masks or products to ""lure"" you into their shop as I had read previously, it is more about getting products I really needed and not on impulse.  The street food at night is a scene to experience as well, but they are not cheap at all! The street lobster stall, I overheard, was more than 10,000 won. Quite pricey if you thinking about street food standard. But there were many other things to see and buy (socks, accessories, stationary) and many restaurants to choose from (but mostly only korean food only). There is a store selling toasted sandwich which is delicious!"
1225,4.0,"Many shops to buy Korean brand makeup, almost all the shop provide special prices for masks and tiny samples"
1226,5.0,"We were there from afternoon till night. Most shops will close by 10. There is much to do if you are into shopping.  Firstly the street food is interesting and well worth trying out.  The number of skin care shops is amazing. Many offered discounts with freebies thrown in. The shop assistants are mostly fluent in Chinese or English, apart from Korean. This made our shopping experience a much better one.  There are plenty of restaurants as well to rest and eat.  We found some shops selling really value for money items. Clothes in 1 store are cheaper than Dongdaemun. Better yet they are fixed priced so no need for bargaining. Another store sold accessories at 50% off store wide. The quality of the rings and earrings is good despite the relatively low price.  After all the shopping we went to do Hanbok photo taking. Also located in the area and it was really memorable.  Overall it was a fun and fulfilling day."
1227,5.0,"Lots of Skin care, street vendors and apparels. From fashion to street food. Even designers like MCM! Nails, hair, aesthetic, restaurants.. etc"
1228,5.0,This is a lovely market for stores and street food. Will suit any budget and has a lovely ornate theatre in the area. Walked this both day and night. Quite safe but watch out for pick pockets. Lots of health and beauty shops here.
1229,4.0,"This is a great shopping area, and a must to visit if you are staying nearby. There are many shops and restaurants in the area. In the evening, the streets come alive when the night market starts. There is a good range of products being sold, from food to clothing. Many tourists throng the streets eating and buying."
1230,3.0,Great area for shopping for beauty products. Lots to see. Lots of food stalls. Great place for people watching.
1231,2.0,Restros are little bit of everything but pricey. Shopping are filled with chainstore and street hawkers. Rather go to area close to Universities.
1232,5.0,What place to visit if you like shopping and food but be warned there are hundreds of people after 3pm
1233,5.0,Is a must visit place for those ladies who love shopping very much.I went there 3 times in a week.Cosmetic is so so cheap compare to my country.I wish i can bring more back.Street foods is delicious especially eat during winter season.
1234,5.0,Anyone who loves to shop should be at Myeongdong. Also there are street food at every corner to satisfy those hungry stomach.
1235,2.0,"My wife and I heard a lot about myeongdong, how the shops give away freebies like nothing, how attractive the sales are. We walked alone street away from the main street of myeongdong searching for face mask with heavy discount, and attracted by the discount signs outside one shop. Guess what? We didn't get freebies. The shopkeeper tried to talk us into buying face mask which are more "" premium"". And when I ask if there is tax free since I hit the 30k won, the answer was NO because the items were at discount. We were very disappointed. Where are the freebies that everyone talked about? When we went to Lotte Duty free shop, we saw the same items sold at same price, but can claim the tax. We are disappointed. Next time we will see where the crowd go, and stay in main street of myeongdong."
1236,4.0,"This place is amazing for people who love to look after their skin, cosmetics are nearly in every shop, feels like you're in heaven as I love make up, recommended for people who loves to look good. Traditional exotic food stalls all over the street, hard to choose they all look delicious and fresh as they are cooked on the spot."
1237,5.0,Myeongdong was a great shopping place in Seoul. There were many shops & restaurants on both sides of the street. There were many pushcarts in the middle of the street selling food and all kind of items. The street was crowded with people and it's a very vibrant shopping place when compared to elsewhere. A must go place when in Seoul !! Love it !
1238,4.0,"Unlike the other market streets, this is upper scale shopping and restaurants. Most if the shopping is cosmetics and clothing. Very clean. Some street food."
1239,4.0,"Great place to get lost and wonder if you have been there or not. There are multiple shops in each alleyways of the same brand so If you didn't buy what you wanted in the other shop, rest easy your chance to buy it will come up in the next alleyway. Oh and samples are great, they will give it to you as long as you go in the shop, but be strong they are really good at selling, otherwise you'll end up buying 200 piece of face mask (while in korea get their beauty products). If you get hungry the street stalls is great place to snack. try the dragon beard candy and if you can their KFC (korean fried chicken) it's to die for!!!"
1240,5.0,"Very busy block of shopping center which sale alot of cosmetics, foods and full of pub/bar at night. You named it, Face shop, Etude house, Innisfree, nature republic, skin 79, skin foods. The price can be 50% cheaper than what your country offer you."
1241,5.0,"An entire area dedicated to beauty products, with all the major beauty brands located here (innisfree, nature republic, skinfood, face shop, balina co., etc). This is the place to buy all your facial products and makeup. There is a Line theme shop in here too that is a must-go place for absolute cuteness.  Food and clothing stalls are set up at the centre of the street every night. Food is pretty overpriced but they offer a good variety.  This is also the place for good food if you know how to find it. There is a famous dumpling shop here and there are great bbq and seafood places hiding in the lanes."
1242,4.0,Good time to kill time as a lot of things to buy though more expensive than other places. Have a lot of different food/snacks and also good place to exchange your monies at great exchange rate (can negotiate as well).
1243,4.0,"The travelled date was actually end March/ early April 2016. I was in Seoul for 12 days and stayed in Myeongdong area because it was convenient for transport to sightsee. The hotel I stayed in was only 10 minute walk from Myeongdeong street area where the real buzz starts from 5.00 pm till late.  Bargains galore for quick souvenirs.....scarves, caps, pins/brooches, ........I love the socks, at AUD 1.00 per pair, great for souvenirs and they're quite good quality ( popular among locals too). Because this area is closed to traffic, many shops operate during the day too. Every other shop sells Korean beauty products. Clothing wise....don't bother if you're above size 12 ( I think that's Euro size 36 ??).  However, it's the street stalls which draw the crowds. Grilled, fried, baked.....from ever favourite octopus/squids, pancakes, rice cakes in hot sauce ( I love the cheese ones) , sticks of fish cakes, etc. They're not as cheap as you think but prepare to pay around Aud 5 a 10 for any single serve. The large scallop, cooked in shell with toppings of corn, cheese...was imo most expensive at nearly AUD15. It was strawberry season and they're sweeter than sweet....must try (I ate about 2kgs over the entire stay). Boxes of dried peaches/persimmons were a little too marked up in price. Plenty of other outlets serving Korean, Japanese and some western. Money changers are aplenty here."
1244,4.0,"In our last day in seoul, we visited this shopping area. This place famous for shopping, cafe and street food.  We arrived at 5.30, intended to shop till you drop :) but my stomach wasn't so cooperative. After a few meter from the subway station, we met some food street outstretched the road. They sell traditional to modern food, from bbq to dessert with reasonable price.  After happy tummy, we stroll along the area. In every 50 meter we found cosmetic store with a lot of brand. Korea is famous for that. You name it, they have it. Etude, faceshop, belif etc.  If you want to see the nanta show, they have a theater there.  But if you want to search for fashion, i suggest better shopping in hongik (young fashion) or dongdaemun market.  This street open till pass midnite."
1245,4.0,"You can find everything here at Meyongdong! From the latest fashion clothes, cosmetics, contact lens and international brand like Nike and Adidas. And don't forget to have some Korea famous street food while walking around the area!"
1246,4.0,"This is the place to visit if you're after Korean beauty and skincare. Definitely walk around a bit first before committing to buying in the first store you see as there's at least 3-4 of the same shop in that area. If you can't find a certain LE item in one place, go to another as you might find it there. There's also tons of other retail stores, plus it's worth exploring the little side streets as there's heaps of big brand knock-offs and fakes that are decent quality and inexpensive. My favourite store was the stationery brand Jetoy's Choo Choo cat. If you're into cats, you're going to love this store! The designs are amazing, and there's so much stationery and other adorable things to choose from!  The street food vendors start popping up closer to late afternoon, just before evening if that's what you're interested in doing."
1247,4.0,"Myeongdong is shopping heaven, either for the street food or skincare.. almost every night we had myeongdong streed food for dinner... variety of Halal food can be found such as egg bun, octopus, lobster, oemok or fish cake and daebokki to name a few... other vendor are selling souvenirs, t-shirt, bag to name a few... for the skin care... just name it all u can find here at myeongdong... they will gv free gift such as mask or sample size of product to allure u to enter their shop...just take the free gift n stroll along their shop, even u dont buy anything u can take the free gift... and if u buy they will give u more free gift..."
1248,3.0,"First time there. However, nothing special. Is the same like in any country. Selling lots of local delicacies. Clothing is more expensive than those selling in any outlets."
1249,5.0,The best place to get big big big discounts on all Korean beauty products!!! A true must visit especially for ladies and make up enthusiasts. They give away free samples too!
1250,5.0,"Shopping district perfect for make up addicts and bargain hunters! You'll find a 5 story Uniqlo across the Pacific Hotel. Lots of shoe stores, ice cream trucks and food trucks. For bargain hunters there are many stalls selling different bargain items such as clothes, gadgets, souvenir items and much more.

1251,4.0,"So many facial shop here.... Value for money.  Of course with others too...  Many eating place with wide choices.  Street Foods start @ 4pm till 10 pm (Just a bit on the high side the price).  Wow, can see mostly tourist from all countries.  When in Korea, must visit here"
1252,4.0,"A famous area full of shops and restaurants. Nice to roam around. Most shops are cosmetics though that are all the same with different brands. At night, more food and stuff stalls are added on the street that made the area livelier. One visit is enough to explore this area. Subway stations are Myeongdong and Euljiro 1."
1253,5.0,"We stayed at Jhill Hotel just in front of the Main Street of Myeongdong.  Everyone knows that this is a shopping street, and there are lots of food hawkers around.  Once you arrive myeongdong, the first thing u should do is find the information center or the person who wearing red hat and red clothes standing in the middle of the street to get a myeongdong map! (You will feel easy to and manage to plan which direction to first and next).  Here got lots of women's things, like clothes, accessory, cosmetic and facial shop.  This is the third time I visit myeongdong, there is one thing difference if compare to last visited, the hawkers now not willing to bargain(not even one cent), I don't know what happen to them. Seems they earn a lot and doesn't bother. But still some will discount abit, for those who not willing to bargain we will just skip them. Everyone do know those hawker mark up margin for sure over 100%, and they have not willing to give us just little discount.  For dinner, we are having Korean style all you can eat! Very cheap, you should look around the sign board, once you visit there you should try their BBQ all you can eat.(I'm sorry to Muslim friends, for those all you can eat restaurant, they do serve pork, Because the cost for pork more cheaper than beef)  My sister do like their grill cheese and rice cake(food hawker), you should try it when u see it, and they also have fresh juice blended on the spot(strawberry) and so on, make sure you bring enough Korean Won to enjoy their local food. ^^  The local fast food named: Mom's Touch is so delicious if compare to our home country KFC fast food. You can have cheese onion flavour or curry spicy flavour friend chicken(yummy).  Myeongdong street connected with two subway station, Eurolji1ga station and Myeongdong station, its very convenience to come or go to other places.  Wish you enjoy your holidays in Seoul."
1254,4.0,"Beauty shops galore! This is a fun experience while in Seoul, just walking around and seeing the madness of shops (mostly beauty/skincare). If you want to buy stuff make sure you do a bit of research beforehand and most sales people don't speak any English and all the packaging is in Korean! I enjoyed banila and co, tonymoly, and nature republic. Have fun!"
1255,5.0,Most amazing shopping place ever. It's not a joke when they said you can lost your way here. Place is big with many cafes and cosmetic shops.  Remarks - Bring a leash for your girlfriend.
1256,5.0,"Myeongdong Shopping Street market is the place you can find everything 'under one roof' sans The Roof :). As an avid traveller, it is a good sign to know that even the locals shop there. Food-stalls, restaurants (burgers, Thai, steamboat, etc), fashion, cosmetics, shoes, the list goes on. The ambience at night got me excited, even if you are not a keen shopper, you can just have coffee and people-watch."
1257,4.0,"This district is THE shopping area of Seoul. There are many different shops with different price ranges. You can mainly find a lot of (Korean) cosmetic shops here. I personally loved shopping here. The only real downside is that the helpers in the shops keep walking up to you and they don't leave you alone. I felt quite uncomfortable a few times. Despite the awkwardness, I will come back when I visit Seoul."
1258,3.0,This is a shopping streets for girls. 80% of the retail shops are meant for girls. Alot of restaurants and street food stalls around. So you wont feel hungry. It is very packed in the night time. 1 to 2 days should be good enough unless you want see every single shop products. Alot of repeated stores in this shopping streets.
1259,5.0,The street food were awesome!!! Freebies are good too!! It was fun to go to Myeongdong. It was like Hong Kong!
1260,4.0,"Great place for shoppers whereby you can shop till you drop!! Plenty of cosmetics, clothings, shoes etc to choose. However, most brand shops are duplicate. Restaurants are also pretty easy to find."
1261,5.0,"Out of four days in Seoul, we spent two straight days here. And I mean all day.  Save yourself some time by doing some homework of which products or at least brands you want to try or purchase. If not, you'll be spending hours here just walking in and out of every store. Each major brand will have at least 5-8 branches within a few block radius so don't sweat if you changed your mind. Feel free to go in and try and ask questions. The staff are quite incredible almost everywhere. Multi lingual and really helpful.  The street vendors sell great stuff too at incredible cheap prices. However. Don't forget to haggle! (Not with the food vendors)"
1262,4.0,"It's a shopping haven for shopaholic like Me. But I've been to nandaemun and got the chance to compare it with the items sold here. Imagine 1 pack of strawberries in namdaemun costs only 2,000KRW while in Myeongdong they were selling it for 5,000KRW. Some of the vendors don't even give you discounts.  My sister wanted to buy those Korean Hats that were sold along the streets of Myeongdong. The vendor said its 50,000KRW. We were in awe because the original Baseball caps were only sold 39,000KRW at Lotte World Mall.  Anyways, this place is fantastic for those picture perfect areas.. But if you want to save than splurge more than what you're budget then I suggest you consider Namdaemun instead of Myeongdong."
1263,5.0,"Its SUPERB and PERFECT for both men and women. While your ladies are going crazy to shop their buy 1 get 1 sheet mask and stuff, you can just go grab a baked cheese scallop or tteokpokki and etc. Its just crazy in Myeongdong. The street food taste sooooo amazing, and so many unique and tempting snack too..ahh.. i would love to go back to korea soon..very soon hopefully.."
1264,5.0,"Lots of things are happening on this street. Will take you more than 3 hours, luckily I chose this neighborhood to stay. You can get any kind of Korean cosmetic and make-up products, international fashion brands, local fashion brands, local mom and pop shops, street food (only in evening) and duty-free shops. I found the best food gem to be the local places upstairs or in the basement. I had the best Korean fried chicken there.  During christmas time, tons of christmas lights on the buildings and nearby parks."
1265,5.0,"Myeongdong is THE place to be when one visits Seoul. You cannot leave Seoul without coming here for the shopping and the food. We stayed at the Ibis Ambassador Myeongdong so we had access to Myeongdong shopping street right at our doorstep. The street is very vibrant and filled with pushcarts selling typical Korean street foods, tons of cosmetic shops and connects people to many shopping malls and shops that especially appeal to shoppers who wants to buy fashionable and trendy goods. It is a very self-contained street where there are activities for everyone - shops for shopaholics, nice eateries and restaurants for foodies and massage/spas and cafes for the people who wait around for their shopaholic/foodie friends. If you can find the time, you can even take a break from shopping to watch the famous highly popular Nanta show at the Myeongdong Theatre just next to the Myeongdong police station. Serious shoppers will be glad to know that there are many Tax Refunds kiosks and counters located within Myeongdong street so you can conveniently settle your tax refund for all your shopping without doing this at the airport."
1266,4.0,If you are in Seoul try to take a stroll through the thoroughfares of Myeongdong. This part of Seoul is bustling with life and is busy throughout the day. Main attractions are it's shops and the array of different restaurant and open air food stalls
1267,4.0,"All of South Korea's major retailers and products are found in and around this bustling street. With clean hawker street food and clean brightly lit shops, the street almost feels akin to a theme park with an lively ambience."
1268,5.0,This place has many shops and many food street stalls.. the food is very delicious and the variety is very good. Highly recommended. . I think islts the heart of Seoul. .  Ps. Take cash with u as all stalls dont have credit card machines..  Many things are irresistible to buy.. Most of those shops close by 10 30 PM .. so plan well .
1269,4.0,Nice shopping streets and side lanes offered good bargin beauty products and delicious street food and good restaurants. At the end of the main shopping street are Lotte Departmental Store and plenty of Duty Free Shops that you could spend whole day there. IT is a MUST visit when you go to Seoul. Highly recommended !
1270,4.0,"A must see!!! U get to taste the different street foods all in one straight lane.  Pushcarts selling all sorts of Korean touristy snacks like seaweeds, flavored almonds, Korean strawberries etc n socks that are selling for KRW1000 = SGD1.25!! Really good quality.  Shops lining the sides are usually cosmetic shops, fashion apparels n restaurants.  We stayed in myeongdong n were super happy that these conveniences are within arms reach to our hotel.  We were never hungry 😆"
1271,5.0,"I chose to stay in Myeongdong due to the night markets, which were fantastic. A huge variety of food available to try in small portions, all between 300-500Won. No one hassles you for anything, its not like thailand or china, all very polite and civilised."
1272,4.0,"crowded in most evening and shopping heaven for the ladies. As for me, i cant get enough of the street food and that is why i keep going back to myeongdong."
1273,5.0,"I was staying near Myeongdong streets so every night it was always my last stop from wherever i was before going back to my hotel. The busy streets of Myeongdong will definitely lift everyone's spirits. Tourists and locals were busy walking, shopping, window shopping and eating. Skin care products were all over these streets and freebies were just about the same. My favorite skin care brand Skinfood was on sale, and i was able to score 10 pcs of sheet masks plus another 10 for only ₩10,000, about P350.00 here in Manila. If you'll purchase it here 1 mask costs P75.00. It was a huge sale in my opinion. Needless to say, i bought a lot and a lot more of their products at Lotte Duty Free where everything was also on sale and way cheaper. Once i got tired of too much browsing, an array of yummy street foods were just a few steps away. I tried almost everything, gimbap, tteokbokki, octopus bbq and sandwich, pomegranate juice, shrimp, crabs, crablets, lobster all of which were breaded and fried and came with a special sauce, odeng, hotteok, kimchi pancake and bunggeopang. I was there for 5 straight nights, no wonder i was able to taste a lot for dinner. Shopping in Myeongdong was 24/7 but my legs can't cope up anymore with the city's business not to mention the places i visited during day time. When i come back to Seoul, i will definitely go back here every night. I'm in love with Myeongdong.❤❤❤"
1274,5.0,Love the shopping area!! Lots of great restaurant and name brand stores. Very crowded. Walking distance from our hotel. The Hotel offer shuttle bus but walking is only 10 min. away. Very safe area.
1275,4.0,"Best to come night time Near train station A long street of korean skin care and make up, affordable shoes (les more shop) and local food You may find non korean brands in Olive Young (e.g Nuxe) Lotte young dept store is across the street, you may find april skin there, if you are looking for one. I recognized only h&m, uniqlo, forever 21 and zara for clothing boutiques, others maybe i dont know the brand Theres a mcdonalds near the center intersection Theyre also offering tax refund slip if you buy more than 30k won Money changer is present Innisfree, Missha, etude house, tony moly and the saem are the common brands along the myeongdong street, you can find more than one store Some stores were giving away free masks No japanese brands like shisheido, hada labo I cannot find perfume boutiques maybe not enough for me to see those You may also see the subway with cheaper clothing line up, if youre a kpop fan youll definitely should consider it, you can also see posters of popular kpop artists being sold there"
1276,5.0,"Myeongdong shopping street is full of cosmetic shops; fashion stores; restaurants; cafe (even cat cafe; dog cafe!) and of course the night market with all the street vendors' stalls along the whole street. Quite fun going from stall to stall to see how they cook the various food. The variety is enormous from giant clams, lobster, various kinds of pancakes, grill meat, to candy floss, roasted chestnuts & sweet potato and freshly pressed juices. Just amazing!"
1277,5.0,"One of the famous place for tourist in Seoul. The place is good for relax or even just for walking. There are many mini market, store, restaurant, cafe and coffee bar. Open time start at 4:00PM until 11:00PM. More better at night while the LED with full color is everywhere"
1278,4.0,It is probably one of the most representative places for shopping. It is extremely crowded so I won't recommend to visit with kids. There are all kind of stores from local to international brands. Not luxury shopping at all.
1279,4.0,"In my opinion Myeongdong is the best Seoul has to offer! From the moment you step onto the street the sounds and scents assaults your senses! The hustle and bustle of persons looking for food, clothes, South Korea's famous face products, specialty cafes is an everyday thing. Never a dull moment here, you could visit everyday for a week and still not experience all it has to offer. It is upscale and Morden with that certain street flair. A must visit if you go to Seoul, if you can live near here, like within walking distance you won't regret it!"
1280,5.0,This is definitely the place to stock up on your cosmetics and skincare products. But please do up a shopping list beforehand or else you will be lost in all the different brands and stores.  I wouldn't recommend getting clothes from Myeongdong because it is more pricey than Ewha and Hongdae. But the street food is a must-try.
1281,5.0,"heaven for woman, u can get all sorts of Korean cosmetics from this place, most shops offer in-shop tax refund. the downside will be that it's very touristy, and restaurants around the area is comparatively pricy."
1282,5.0,"One of the primary shopping district in seoul. Many brand name shops and department stores line the streets and alleys. Myeongdong also has family restaurants, fast food, plus korean, western and japanese dining options. So many place to go in here. You must be here guys.. Dont miss it"
1283,5.0,lots of hotels in the area great nightlife lots of shopping areas lots of street foods too very easy to navigate
1284,5.0,"Myeongdong didnt fail to impress me. This place is my most favorite spot in Seoul because it offered me heaven as a tourist and as a backpacker. It offered a variety of goods from beauty/hygiene products, clothings, food and experience. This place is so youthful to the extend that Korean Hallyu is really noticeable.  I must mention that street foods in Myeongdong are to die for. Swear!"
1285,4.0,"Like what others have commented, this is heaven for people who are looking for Korean facial products. Within a street, you can find 3 to 4 innersfree stores. Ask for discount if you are buying more and they will also throw in a couple of their new products."
1286,5.0,"A must do visit for everything. Korean modern culture, shopping, dining, entertainment. It is a regular destination for our family. Get lost in the friendly mayhem"
1287,4.0,"This is purely for cosmetics all around, however there are street food which is nice but expensive. Recommend for girls"
1288,2.0,"It's rows and rows of shops selling cosmetics and face masks.  Be wary of those touting free samples, as taking a sample will mean you have to pay a visit into the store, and not buying anything could result in them snatching the sample back from you. All a very ride experience.  Nonetheless, if you are looking for cosmetics and beauty masks of all sorts, check out the street.  During winter months, night market for street food opens after 3pm.."
1289,4.0,Eat while you shop! One of the best places to shop in Seoul is Myeongdong Street. Prices are reasonable and cheaper compared to other shopping districts in Seoul. I just loved trying out the street food while hopping from one store to the next.
1290,5.0,my hostel is in myeongdong..i was able to try nd eat the street food everyday hahaha..tasted them ..yummy! stir fried rice is burning my mouth to much spicy..i love it.. but too bad got allergy to dried squid..souvenirs are good and i love those socks they are selling..colorful..its a nice place to explore especially on cosmetics nd malls
1291,5.0,I went there for the street food at night rather than shopping. You can find cheaper products(from the same brand) in other places.
1292,5.0,"There're so many attractive shops. And they provide customer with cheaper price than Japanese counterparts. When you are tired of shopping, you can take a rest at a caffe shop. There are also many fascinating caffe shops."
1293,5.0,"Myeongdong is without a doubt the paradise for shopping lovers. Hardly could you find the difference between day time and night time here as this place is full of people all day long. There're numerous cosmetics, fashion, restaurants in the area, from budget to high-end. You surely can find the suitable ones with your budget. You can't immagine how fast time flies when you're in Myeongdong. You might think you spend 15' in each store, but actually you will end up with leaving it 1 hour later haha. The thing I like the best when shopping in Korea is that shops are very generous in giving customers samples and gifts. Uggghhhh greatttt! And don't forget to tried street food. So yummy. And buying strawberry too. Strawberry are extremely delicious and much cheaper compared with those in Japan (price might differ according to buyers and how big the fruit is)."
1294,4.0,"I would say Myeongdong is the best shopping place in Seoul, or even in South Korea. There are so many shops especially skin care and cosmetics. Line Store is very interesting. Clean public bathroom is available at the subway station."
1295,3.0,"I must warn that I am biased in this review because i simply do not like crowded area and this place is super crowded. To add to the crowdedness, we were all wearing winter clothings. So imagine the squeezing and pushing. If you don't mind all that then it is a great place to find street food. Lot of them! All nice and cheap."
1296,5.0,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is a must visit in Seoul. Look out for Line Store with their HUGE Bear mascot welcoming you at the entrance and you are free to take as many photographs you want inside the store.  There are dozens and dozens of shops selling skin care products and you are spoilt for choices. As for international clothing brands I highly recommend the Zara Myeongdong Store that gives good discounts during their sales and they have an extensive range for both sexes.  There are many lanes and alleys that might put you in maze and for a while you find yourself lost in Myeongdong. So, best to remember a landmark so you can make your way back.  If you see people distributing free goodies bag do grap one and besides free samples inside you might be lucky to find vouchers in exchange for free bags at Shinsegae department store and also vouchers to purchase Arex train ticket from Seoul Station to Incheon Airport at a discounted price."
1297,4.0,This place is a shopping heaven for girls or anyone. You can spend a whole day here. I recommend bringing some kind of luggage or bags with wheels because you will buy a lot and carrying your bags around all day can be tiring.
1298,5.0,"This place has been on my mind ever since I left! If you're like me and love make-up, skincare, food, clothes. JUST EVERYTHING. Then this strip is just for you! The food stalls don't come out til 4-5PM so I suggest either ditch dinner plans & just try everything (which I did on many occasions!) huge variety of different types of food! This strip is makeup/skincare heaveeeeeeeen! So many stores, with so many unique & popular products! Also with plenty of samples! Don't forget to ask for your samples! All the store-workers are happy to help even though there might be a slight language barrier. Literally went here at least once a day!"
1299,5.0,"Everything is great...sounds, smells, people, noise... The food is cooked in front of you and at Meyon Dong I took the best orange juice of my life."
1300,4.0,"Myeongdong is an amazing experience that morphs and changes as the hours pass. After 5pm, out of nowhere, emerge street vendors, food carts in the middle of these tiny lane ways. Unbelievably, cars and trucks still meander through the chaos at all hours, so be careful! It was like the vampires emerged from the dark, but these people were NOT vampires, they were gorgeous, beautiful, well dressed and groomed, young people, out to have fun! Coming from Melbourne Australia, where are city lane ways and alleys are famous for their art, food, culture and atmosphere, we thought we would be prepared for the Myeongdong experience. How wrong we were. As the sun set, literally thousands of hip, cool, well-dressed and well endowed, young ones converged from goodness knows where, into the streets and filled it with a buzz and almost electric excitement. It felt like a carnival or street fair, only this happens every night! Enhancing this cracking atmosphere are the street spruikers and touters - lots of people offering 2 for 1 deals and other tempting offers. It seemed as if there are more than 200 shops, selling different potions of face cream, whiteners and promises of youth and eradication of wrinkles. If you ask me, I am yet to see or find a Korean woman's wrinkle! The shops are amazing! They are not cheap but here one has the opportunity to buy genuine, high end brands and good quality items. The shop assistants all ignored me as I guess, a roly-poly, over 50, baby boomer is NOT their target market. We just walked around over 4 nights and I don't think we scratched the surface. Every night, thousands of young, beautiful people massed together to shop, eat, have fun and soak up the incredible atmosphere. We had more fun, ""people watching"" than shopping. There are all the major multi-national retailers like Zara, H&M, Daiso, MCM and the Uniqlo shop claims to be the biggest in Korea etc. Don't expect a lot of English to be spoken and most of the clothes cater to the smaller Asian sizes. Likewise with shoes. Every night was a different experience and a blast. Western people will have a wry smile as foods such as Nutella & banana crepes are considered ""premium"" and priced at the very top end of the scale, whereas to us, this sort of food is no big deal (we have to watch calories, fats, questionable palm oil additives etc. issues that don't even seem to be on the radar in Seoul) It is much better to do as the locals and we learned to love kimchi (fermented cabbage and radish) which is served with EVERY meal. Do yourself a favour and book a tourist, kimchi school lesson, in order to learn how to prepare it and spice it to one's liking. Our stomachs went through a revolution with fermented food and Korean cuisine. Myeongdong is amazing and we absolutely loved it, although it really is more suited to the hipster, under 30, high earning young ones or at least those who are young at heart ;-) The area is extremely well serviced by public transport [subway], buses and moderately priced taxis. No Uber available yet. We soaked up the atmosphere of Myeongdong, dined, wined and walked till we were exhausted and could not go further. This area showcases the success, hard work and achievements of the young, well-educated Korean society, trying to balance tradition and culture with modern technology and progress. Amazing!"
1301,3.0,"Myeongdong really has just about everything you'd want, shopping wise. The information angels stationed at major junctions were very helpful - they speak English, Mandarin and Japanese. Funnily enough, we went back often for food - O'Sulloc tea house, BBQ galbi ribs and fried chicken."
1302,5.0,"It is great place for shopping and dinning! All kinds of brands of cosmetic and skin care, won't miss any such as Innisfree, etude house, VDL, Holika Holika, skin food etc.. Lotte duty free is also located near by. Few Supermarket open till midnight. Lots of famous dinning restaurant, Korean beef, all u can eat pork, fried chicken, coffee houses and more! If u only have limited time staying in Seoul, just go to Myeongdong shopping street!"
1303,5.0,"You want to get yourself pampered with all kind of fashions, facials, trends, unusual street food (this is not the traditional type but created for tourists) and lots of variety of food (restaurants everywhere)!  It was truly pack during Christmas day and tonnes of people just wanted to get out of the house and hang around here. You can see so many different type of people (I mean local and tourists)! Get some discounted items on your facial products, sports shoes of all brands (I can't find my size~Arrgh) and nearby is the Nanta Show Centre.  We got to taste a good local food ~ A pot for all. It was really good and we actually cannot finish it. Top Korea Tour private guide, Juno Lee brought us there! Yeah I know I can walk there but the purpose was the show and a walkabout in Myeongdong!  You won't regret walking to all the streets but avoid the small lanes. There is a Cathedral Church too! Trust me, this place has too many brands for you to choose and I was lost for a moment of time!  Once you are out from the Myeongdong Street, you can see the KDrama shooting view that they have taken in some points. Find out on the latest Mermaid story. Oh yeah, things are not cheap there actually but you need to find out which to get and ask for the discount! Majority of the sales person could speak Chinese but a minor can speak basic English! Have fun rounding, shopping and eating!  Shop and Eat till you drop!"
1304,5.0,"Love this place...night stalls and cafes and food establishments aplenty. Lots of shopping too. Personally, nothing beats the fact that it is such a vibrant place...especially at night. Plenty of hotels there and a good place to see Seoul by night."
1305,5.0,"Myengdong Shopping District has it all. Apparel, cheap bargains, yummy korean foods, branded clothes, souvenirs, skincare, name it, Myeongdong has it all. If you wanna go cheap finds, you just need to walk around first for you to compare prices and for you to enjoy the whole myengdong district."
1306,4.0,"As others said, go on an empty stomach and with plenty of money. Street food paradise - make sure you stop by the strawberry mochi stand and the flower gelato place. Lots of shopping but surprisingly little variety - cosmetics, clothes, bags, and socks. Tons of skin care shops, but many of the same chain in different locations. Plus side: awesome 1+1 sales on masks! Massive crowds at all times and occasional vehicle traffic at night.  On Sundays (at least the two Sundays I was in town), there are religious groups distributing literature protesting verichip implants. Some of the content may be disturbing to kids (references and images of the ""mark of the beast"")."
1307,5.0,"On a long layover in Seoul, I decided to head to Myeongdong. In short, this is shopping heaven. There are a lot of options if you are looking for skin care products. Don't be too easily lured in by the free masks and don't be afraid to ask for extra samples if you do chose to make a purchase at a store.  There are also a ton of street food vendors. The prices vary, but it all fairly inexpensive. You could easily come with an empty stomach and leave very satisfied. I wish I ate more when I was there!"
1308,4.0,"IF you can speak chinese, never an issue here. Almost all the shop staffs can speak better chinese than english.  Beauty haven! All the different beauty brands have diff stores all over this area. Heard that some are from the direct brand while some are franchise. Direct stores can do instant de-taxe - meaning you pay the tax-free price. While franchise stores you will still need to get the tax back from the airport. But do note that the tax amount being returned is not by percentage. I.e if you spend 30k-50k won , you will get back 2000won. 50-90k won, you will get back 3 or 5000 won. The tax rebate goes along this way. At least this was what I was told by the shop assistants."
1309,2.0,Too touristy and street food are very expensive which you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Shops are pretty similar from one street to another. Our boys enjoy the cat cafe there.
1310,5.0,"There are literally same brans on every street. Etude house, innisfree, holika holika, banila & co, nature republic, tony moly, etc, you can find them on almost every streets in Myeongdong. There is also street food at night. Best to visit at night if you have limited time."
1311,4.0,"Similar like a 'pasar malam' in between a long row of shops. Explored the area and found lots of Korean beauty products, any brand that you are looking for. Plenty of young ladies who brought their pull on luggages - i think to replenish their stocks. There were also plenty of eateries around. Japanese, Korean, BBQ and etc. the thing was that they were mostly on level 1 onwards which requires us to climb steps up (a little difficult for us who travelled with baby stroller) - Similar like Hong Kong. The street food sold there wasn't exactly cheap either. Strawberries at KRW7000 (Though they were good quality, juicy, sweet and plump and a box has approximately 2 dozen strawberries) KRW1500 for a roasted sweet potato, KRW1000 for a piece of sweet pancake, KRW1000 for a grilled cheese stick. Having said that, the quality food is good. As i wasn't there to shop till i drop, i think the experience was ok though the weather was really harsh."
1312,5.0,"Plenty of shops, especially for makeup and cosmetics products. The food street is wonderful as well, good variety."
1313,4.0,"A very popular shopping street with tons of Korean cosmetic brands as well as other internationally known fashion brands. Nearby is the huge Lotte department store. Be warned that it gets very crowded in the late afternoon. Some shops get very cramped and service can be non-existent if you are not buying much, as many shops get lots of tourists from mainland China who buy in bulk."
1314,5.0,"I love shopping and this place is a mecca. Im near SFO but I think I left my heart in Myeongdong Shopping Street. I love the night street food, the makeup stores, the vibrance of the atmosphere and the variety of products. I can never get bored here even if I have to come back everyday."
1315,5.0,This area has a long history in the 1950s it was the Centre of fashion and Korean delights. Now it has really turned into a tourist go zone and has lost some of its appeal. The cathedral is a must at the end and the famous Myeongdong kalguksu noodle place is still there. Go early. Across the road is lotte dept store and Shinsegae. Take bus 143 straight to apkujeong rodeo street 25 mins or the subway. This area is famous for up style dining and living. V good coffee at Mark Lane brewers. South Gate market is also 10 mins walk where you can buy anything.  These places are a must.
1316,5.0,"Best of Korean beauty brands everywhere - same brand, multiple shops. Shopping not the cheapest, but one can find almost anything there - uniqlo, H&M, sports outlets with Nike, Adidas, Vans & Superga, local clothing & accessories ...... the list is neverending. Street food is generally more expensive than other shopping streets like Dongdaemun, Edae and Hongdae - and not as tasty."
1317,5.0,Myeongdong Shopping Street is vibrant and bustling! Many shops and restaurants around and street food vendors selling a variety of yummy street food too! Definitely worth a visit! Thumbs up!
1318,4.0,"I'm a girl who does not wear make up for daily purposes. And never really been interested in it. But MyeongDong has definitely open my eyes for a new reason to actually like and wear make up.  My summary of MD: Make-up, tourist, food, make-up.  Plenty of hostels around the area, and it's a couple of blocks away from Lotte Shopping Mall.  And there are plenty of streetfood around the area that you might want to try."
1319,5.0,My daughter's favorite place to walk and buy street food. Every imaginable type of street food available from vendors.
1320,5.0,"Best shopping place in Seoul. Lotte department store, lotte young plaza and sinsegei dept store are just a short walk away. You can find almost anything here ( cosmetics, clothes, accessories, food , cafes) from cheap street vendors to high end brands. The night market sells a lot of delicious korean traditional street food. A must visit when you are in Seoul."
1321,5.0,Can be quiet busy so if you have small children keep them near.. the market has an abundance of socks and face masks so be prepared to see them every corner.. food is easily found.
1322,3.0,Clouded with the tourists and a lot of branded shops and cosmetic shops every where. Easy to find. Try to avoid lunch time and clouded spot.
1323,4.0,"I went to this place twice (my friend wanted to get more make-up :D). There are several shops in this area. Some are the same brand but they have different promos. If you have the time, look around first. If not, get the item if it's a good deal. I recommend the ff: 1. Get a map from a tourist info center or one of the info persons wearing a red coat with information written on it. 2. List down what you want to buy and its price in your country (so you know if you're getting a good deal). You may get overwhelmed at the sheer amount of items available. 3. There's a tax refund for a minimum purchase of 30,000 KRW so if you have a friend, pay jointly. 4. People offer freebies along the street. Don't take it unless you intend to buy from their store. And watch out for sales persons who actually pull you into their store. 5. Street food in MyeongDong is more expensive compared to other places in Korea so go here with a full stomach (unless you don't mind spending more money). 6. Visit the Myeong Dong tourist information center (near a bank) to try on a hanbok and take pictures for free."
1324,5.0,We stayed in a guest house just a few walks away from Myeongdong Shopping Street so I was always here every night during my stay in Seoul. I enjoyed going here every night whether I was on a hunt for a good bargain or just to kill time. I enjoyed the energy and the vibe of this busy street. I am personally not into cosmetics but shopping for my friends' request was so much fun here in Myeongdong. Get lost in all the brands that this district can offer. I did enjoy the shopping and the freebie haul during this trip. Maybe next time will have a list of my own on what cosmetics to buy.
1325,3.0,"Yes, the cosmetic and skincare products are everywhere and everything they said it will be. Affordable and good. But the service leave plenty to be desired. We walked into a few shops where the salesperson will give us a look and decide that we are not worthy of good service. Well, fret not if you experience such services for a few shops down you will find a similar shop who will be willing to serve you well. But still, such regular and frequent run in of bad services leave an unpleasant memories of the place. Would rather not go back as there are plenty of other streets to buy similar products."
1326,5.0,"Went on a cold evening but still enjoyed the walk. A variety of shops for everyone as well as sidewalk stores for souvenirs. Eat your way through the food stores, gastronomic. Could do with more bins"
1327,4.0,"I pretty much have everything I need so I'm not much of a shopper. But I do like to eat from time to time, in fact, often as three times a day. Fishcakes, flame roasted clams and lobster, and a number of things of which I have no idea what I ate, are all available in spades. Go hungry, leave satiated, avoid the fancy stores and and return to your hotel none the poorer."
1328,5.0,Very crowded and happening! Many type of food and shops. The things prices were quite affordable. Bought a pretty hand bag and souvenir at here.
1329,5.0,"Shopping district with a wide range of products and genres, from established higher end brands to cheaper local products. There's a night street market selling quite a lot of food too, good way to wind up the day after a long day! Recommended area to stay due to the convenience! There's quite a few accommodation areas nearby."
1330,5.0,"I love Myeong dong shopping street. It is easy to access by metro. It also has everything you are interested, wide range of products and services. You can also get tax refund at some shops as well."
1331,4.0,"Lots and lots of shops that are pretty much the same in every corner of myeongdong. Make up, shoes, clothes of the same brand alternating. Super lively. Shop assistants here usually also speak chinese and japanese too and even Thai in some shops. These people are used to foreigners so it might be a bit easier to buy stuffs here than say make up store booth in the subway. Mind you that they usually sell things in pack of like a dozen e.g. Masks unless you ask for singles. I also find that when shopping for cosmetics go for the one further away from the main myeongdong road; less pushy, more friendly. Street food after sun down. Beware of people trying to drag you into shops. It could be just a make up store or some sketchy premises."
1332,5.0,"There are many food stalls opened from the evening in the Shopping Street in Myeongdong that offers a different variety of food such as cakes, fried chicken, grill steak and lobsters, Korean local food etc. Visit during early evening and you can enjoy shopping as well as dining at the same time. There are also many Korean restaurants in the area where you can dine comfortably. Remember to visit the Lotte Department Store opposite. The currency exchange near the Chinese embassy also offers good exchange rates. In short, one place for shopping and good food."
1333,5.0,"Roaming the streets and checking the local street food is so fun, u wont get bored doing it for days. So many options and cheap shopping"
1334,3.0,Of course everyone goes to Myeongdong when they visit seoul. It's a popular walking street with throngs of rowdy tourists. It can be overpowering at times. I enjoyed a casual evening eating street food and buying some cosmetics. Lots of free samples to collect but be prepared to brave the crowds and pushy sales people. Don't expect quality food.
1335,5.0,"A must-visit. Be prepared to spend some time to browse the shops, and lots of eating places too. Interesting food stalls with traditional Korean foods. Night scene is exciting too."
1336,4.0,"Was in Korea for a business trip, had to squeeze in a trip to Myeongdong shopping street ! Must go for all tourists.  Many interesting street food stalls (halal ones : kebab , ding dang sweet) which serve up a variety of street food (I only tried the halal ones and the cheese lobster ,banana chocolate crepe, cuttlefish), great for hungry stomachs when your shopping in the winter cold.  There's also a few halal restaurants, Potala and another one at ground floor near Potala always with long queues of Muslims(can't remember the name offhand), selling hotpot and traditional Korean food.  Best place to shop for cosmetics ! And for trendy street clothes and shoes. Only thing is the things are as expensive as Singapore , so not for those who like to cut a bargain.  Overall, a must see in Seoul!"
1337,4.0,"The entire street is basically lined with shops selling different facial products, e.g. Face shop, innisfree, laneige, etc. As most of the shops can do tax rebates immediately so it's saves time and effort at the airport subsequently. There are also shops selling the latest street fashion so you can also check in on latest accessories and clothes.  There are also lots of streetfood so it may be good to go with an empty stomach and eat along the streets!"
1338,4.0,"plenty to shop and lots to eat. Very interesting night market with lots of hawkers food stall. Always full of people walking up and down the streets and alleys, but be aware of occasion traffic. It is no vehicle free zone."
1339,5.0,"I went to South Korea with my classmates for our graduation trip. Many people recommend us to go Myeongdong Shopping Street before our trip because they know we are all shopaholic. It is really a shopping paradise with enormous things to buy, like cosmetics, clothing, and accessories. Many shops are having discounts to attract customers to buy, the sales are passionate and friendly, they are kind to answer our queries. Aside from shopping, there are many Korean cuisines like Korean coffee shops, Korean barbecue restaurant, and Korean street food which are delicious and characterized. Moreover, if you still not shop enough, you can do more shopping in the underground and shopping malls nearby. If you buy at a certain amount or above, tourist can enjoy tax-refund. Myeongdong Shopping Street provides Chinese translators and the sales know Chinese well, so language difference is not a problem. Thus, it is a place with many things to do, things to buy, and things to eat. I will suggest you to wear comfortable shoes because you will feel tired after whole day shopping."
1340,2.0,"Just because I was curious about this area, I headed for Myeongdong to find out what it was all about. I do not know about the stores, which seem to be like in any other place. But the main attraction (or distraction) seem to be the food stalls. I did not find all of them cheap. In all, the combination of stores and food on the street was too weird to my taste. How do you find stores selling beauty product with such amount of food on the streets? Not my cup of tea."
1341,4.0,"Myeongdong for shoppers. Many tourists from china who seem to empty the shelves of popular products. Skincare shops at every street and turn, same-brand shops can be found meters away from each other. Eateries, food streets, subway, bus services, all conveniently found here. Myeongdong cathedral, and UNESCO building to catch the Nanta Show were our to-do things on this trip. Did not disappoint. Tour ambassadors who speak English (plus other languages?) on hand with to assist."
1342,5.0,"You wouldnt think the world economy is going through a tough time when you are here. Everyone is buying, man & women! From clothes, bags, accessory, skincare products to snacks & different price range to suit your budget.  There are also plenty of eateries, cafe, restaurants which are usually on 2nd Floor, or on the fringe of Myeongdong & tuck in small alley. I would avoid those with touter which are usually seafood & BBQ place.  The supermarkets are all undergrounds, and if you only have a few moments, head for the supermarket cos they have all the must buy snacks & beauty care products including masks at much cheaper price than the actual stores.  My advice is to bring extra foldable luggage such as Longchamp. We came with two half filled XL luggage & went back fully filled &2 XL Longchamp fully expanded! But everyone else have 2x more!"
1343,5.0,"Needless to say, very popular spot for shopping and eating your hearts out. I shopped like crazy. Try to combine your shopping together with your friends and family in one shop, the more discount you will have and free samples!"
1344,2.0,Large tour groups flood the streets and is no longer the fun place that Seoulites go. I lived in Seoul for 6 years and have watched this once fun place turn into a tourist trap. No longer for locals.
1345,4.0,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is full of tourists. It is a good place to buy Korean branded cosmetics and to sample local street food. There are two underground shopping malls but I would not recommend to spend too much time in these two dated malls. If you have the cash to splash, you can go to the luxury Lotte Dept Store. If you love fashion, there are more interesting places to shop and to look at youth and Korean pop culture. Hongdae for youth culture. Sinsa dong for more fashionable and pricey fashion. And you will like Coex Mall in Gangnam which has the largest underground shopping mall in Asia and luxury Hyundai Dept Store."
1346,5.0,"You will be surrounded by cuisines, beauty shops, souvenirs, coffee houses.... Wow I will say! Another shopping paradise. Addicted to Sweet Potatoe Latte from Ediya Coffee. Really aromatic taste that makes you want more of it. Within my 4 days stay, I drank at least 2 cups a day to keep me warm during the winter cold. Along the sides, the unique yellow trees were planted which brightens up the attractions. I bet you can almost get what you want. Promotions going on in the beauty shops especially face masks, toners, moisturizers, cleanser.... etc. Saw a Whale skeleton(Seoul Signature Tower) along the way back to Hotel just opposite."
1347,4.0,"Shopping for knick knacks, and fun items worth the visit. Street Food was amazing. Hygiene Levels amazing, so good with that I was impressed."
1348,4.0,You will most certainly find what you are looking for around this shopping area or end up buying something you did not even need. Also lots of food stalls to satisfy both savory and sweet palates.
1349,5.0,Shopping freak people can visit Myeongdong market. This is central place of Seoul and you will get everything what you except few options of electronics whichbyou will get in Gagnam street. Must see location.
1350,5.0,It was very unique shopping street..but it mostly not cheap at all for sourv. Need to bargain more if you want to buy more that 5 and above. Can get cheaper if you can speak korean..they love it eventho your korean is so-so.. at least we tried to impress then for cheaper prices.. but they very friendly all the time.. maybe have some of them not.. it depends on the situation.. hehhe .. luckily i get too much cheaper price plus with extra free give..
1351,5.0,"Great shopping area, very vast. Good variety of upper end street vendors (socks, toys) and stores. Bought socks, uniqglo and stuffed animals. Also had chicken and beer. Would recommend for an evening/few hours."
1352,5.0,This is a must visit for people who want to shop especially for cosmetics and for those who just want to go on a food trip. The streets are lined with cosmetics shops and some other goods (like Uniqlo). The area though busy is relatively clean and safe. My only complaint is that the main street should have been closed to vehicles and converted into a more pedestrian friendly area.
1353,5.0,"From the Ibis Ambassador Myeongdong, the shops are at the doorstep so to speak.Also ideal for zipping back to hotel to deposit 1st load of shopping & zipping out again for next load."
1354,5.0,Great area to visit mainly at the evening. A lot of food's stands with a verity and Korean traditional food. Many shops and restaurants to visit. Do not miss if you are in Seoul.
1355,5.0,Shopping district for beauty and modern fashion stuffs. Also good place for tasting street foods and local restaurants.
1356,5.0,I love shopping here for the variety in Korean cosmetic products the food here is quite nice as well even though not much of a variety. The street is always full f people and the atmosphere is fun
1357,4.0,We wondered the area and also shopped I. The big Lotte department store nearby. Great food and lots of shops. It was fun.
1358,5.0,"I loved the experience. There were a lot of options between fashion, food, cosmetics, hostels and a lot more. I'll never get tired of this place because of the wide variety of selections."
1359,5.0,the place is bustling with activities and there are lots of nice street food there. You can also buy lots of cosmetic there cos there are many cosmetic shops there. Its really eat and shop cosmetic till you drop!
1360,5.0,"The first time I walked through Myeongdong's shopping area was Wednesday early afternoon, and it was relatively empty. I didn't understand what everyone was talking about.  Then I braved the elements, and went out on a Saturday evening around 8pm. Not to shop, but to experience the crowd. It was crazy and exhilarating. I suggest you do the same, but don't shop! In that crowd it's impossible to think straight, and you'd end up spending more money than you should.  I have huge respect towards all the people working in the area."
1361,3.0,"We had heard that this is one place you must visit in Seoul and do shopping. Well it is like another centreplace for shopping in any other city of the world. The streets are narrow, very crowded and one has to move in a sea of people."
1362,4.0,"If you're into korean fashion, food, and makeup, here is the one-stop station where you can get everything you want without burning a hole in your pocket. However, I would say half a day is sufficient as the shops / styles are repetitive."
1363,5.0,"The best part of our trip was staying in Myeongdong and being near to the numerous cosmetic brands. The street vendors also set up shop in the evening till about 11pm for food and accessories.  There also many restaurants and food outlets to cater to various taste buds. Convenience stalls are also everywhere, including a few Marts that sell Korean food stuff. They even provide packing and sending to your hotel.  An interesting outlet are the Line shop where one can take a photo with the huge Brown bear and shop for their merchandise and Brown ice cream. Other interesting places are the Cat and Dog cafes where you can play with the cute and beautiful animals while you have a drink. Their mascots are usually out and about to advertise their cafes.  Do watch out for traffic as some parts of the streets are accessible to cars and motorbikes. The place is clean but Rubbish bins are not often seen. So do bring along a plastic bag if you are trying out the street food as you may end up with alot of stuff on your hands. Also, the streets may be a little confusing at first as they all seem to look the same.  We hardly see anyone bring children while there, but South Koreans generally seem to like them. It may get a little boring for the kids if the wife is shopping alot. We entertained the kids by trying out the different food."
1364,5.0,Started down the main street late afternoon and finished up after dinner. Headed there to do some shopping and came away with bags full of beauty products. Face masks and shampoos are MUST buys here. Found a Korean grill restaurant to have dinner and wish I'd saved room for the fantastic street foods... grilled lobster for 5000 won - MUST try!
1365,5.0,"Myeongdong is one of the primary shopping districts in Seoul and arguably its most impressive. It’s home to many mid- to high-end stores like Lacoste, Ralph Lauren, Forever 21, Bulgari, and LV, not to mention row upon row of Korean cosmetic shops such as The Face Shop, Belif, Primera, Holika Holika, The Saem, ONL, Shara Shara, Etude House, Aritaum (which houses Laneige, Aritaum, Hanyul, IOPE, Modi), Laneige, Mamonde, and more.  When you hear people talking about Korean cosmetics, they’re probably talking about this place. An attraction on its own, these cosmetics are what many tourists come here for.  There are tons and tons of good glorious street foods and restaurant available here. You got to come to Myeongdong and check out the atmosphere yourself!"
1366,5.0,"The small foodstands deserve the 5 stars, offering you a wide variaty of korean tastes at affordable prices. Prices at the stores were expensive though, so don't expect to find any bargains."
1367,4.0,"It is definitely a dream street for K-beauty lovers! You can shop from day to midnight, as most of the shops will only close at around 12am. Other than cosmetics, Myeongdong shopping street is also equipped with many delicious street food and restaurants! It is a must go place for girls~~"
1368,4.0,"It took me forever to find this (don't know why) but go at night, an incredible array of people, shops, restaurants, and food carts (really, try the food carts!)"
1369,4.0,"Shopping heaven for skincare and makeup You can go round and round the streets. Plenty of choices for food too! Myeongdong theatre house live performances, cinema Theater is also available."
1370,4.0,"For a first visit to Seoul, Myeongdong should be one of those stops in the itinerary that you should not miss. Myeongdong is a place that is also relatively great for street photography too, especially at night when the crowds get rather packed. It is quite easy to get here by the Seoul Metro at Myeongdong Station, but it is also surprisingly easy to walk down here too from other places such as Insadong or the Main Lotto Department Store. Myeongdong is great for mainly two things: food and shopping.  The food is something everyone can be satisfied with while there. There are the usual restaurants at the shopping malls and blocks lining Myeongdong, but the real deal here are the street stalls, which will start to appear and step up in the afternoon at around 3pm plus. But most of them will only be active at night, and that is also when Myeongdong looks and feels at its best. The food at the street stalls are quite good, especially its ice cream and traditional Korean snacks. However, compared to our experience at Taiwan's night markets, they still lag behind a little in quality in our opinion. Even if you do not know Korean, you can just point at the food you want and the vendor will understand easily. Price-wise, they are not really the cheapest and are quite comparable to similar places in Seoul.  The other thing Myeongdong is great is the shopping, especially for the ladies! Sure, there are shops for everyone like Artbox and the Line Friends shops, but one thing that you will notice there is the relatively large proportion of cosmetics shops, such as Olive Young, Nature Republic and Innisfree, just to name a few. You can get quite good bargains on these cosmetics there and they even offer a few samples for you to try or take before you buy!  There is also something for the animal lover, with cat cafés and dog cafés at Myeongdong. There's even a ring making café for those couples looking for a unique experience. However, the cafes are often not obvious at first glance as they are often situated at the smaller and less crowded alleys, so it may take a while to look for these places.  Because of the heavy influx of tourists from China, that means that many of the street stall owners and shopkeepers are often able to speak some Mandarin these days too, along with a bit of English. In fact, quite a certain amount of the store signage were in Mandarin too. Myeongdong Cathedral is a short walk away at the end of the street, and is worth taking a look as well. If you wish to change your money to the South Korean Won in South Korea, this is the place to change as the rates are often more favourable here and the value of the South Korean won tends to drop outside of South Korea."
1371,5.0,"If you're into you Korean cosmetics and face care..this IS the place. It's like a couple of blocks of all the Korean cosmetics brands available on earth lol Etude House, The Face Shop, Tony Moly, Missha etc are all here, many having multiple outlets in the area.  Lots of freebies like face mask sheets & sample lotions etc when you buy something and if you buy alot, feel free to ask for extra freebies or bargain the price down ;) Research what brands and products you're going to buy before you come here to save yourself some time because it's quite addictive and you can easily spend half the evening in this area just wandering around selecting everything.  Apart from all the street food, there isn't much to eat here. There's that famous noodles place but I found it very garlicky and overrated and also that famous bibimbap place on th quieter end which was also overrated. Definitely get your cosmetics fix here and eat elsewhere! Namdaemun is a short 10mins walk away ;)"
1372,4.0,"Visited here on my first day in Seoul, right after checking in to the hotel, with main objective - dinner. Gotta admit that this place is a cool place where you can find lots of street food and goods, as well as lots of cosmetic products. If you are aiming for the cosmetics nd street food (they have halal food here), this place have them."
1373,3.0,"Went with my wife, and my two young children. The stores and atmosphere were really nice and clean. Kinda like the Korean version of the Grove in LA if anyone has been. There are some American stores that have made it to Korea but because of the cost of import a pair of American made shoes costs about 3x's more. The biggest downfall was the crowd. It was a bit much. If you have any type of anxiety or have panic attacks with large groups... This is not the place to be."
1374,5.0,I stayed in Myeongdong street for 5 nights with J-Hill hotel. I am happy everyday to shopping and eat delicious food. Their street food is outstanding. Look much cleaner compare to Thailand street food. This area is full of tourist and you can bargain with street vendors for clothes and souvenir. The Lotte Department Store is 5 minutes away.
1375,4.0,"Great place to exchange money (I got 26 more won per dollar than at the best rate offered at Incheon airport)! Keep walking until you see the row of banks, and then you'll see the exchange shops all dotted around them. They are quite competitively priced, but make sure you ask 4-5 shops before exchanging. You can also negotiate a little bit on top (a few won per dollar...enough for a snack, depending on how much you're exchanging!)  The exchange places are quite safe, and they mostly all speak basic English/Chinese/Japanese. I was very happy with my transaction there.  Afterwards, there are a few shopping malls like Migliore, and lots of cosmetic shops to browse. Some cosmetic shops (especially without a famous brand) will entice you with free sheet mask/ other small thing to enter and browse. You need to browse for at least a couple of minutes but don't feel obliged to buy anything to keep your gift.  A lot of cosmetic stores are repeats (eg there are like 3 Missha stores, 3 Tony Moly and at least 2 nature republic). Because you get good gifts if you spend over a certain amount (there are tiers/ thresholds advertised on a sign in the store), make sure if you want to buy stuff from 1 store, just browse, browse, browse and then buy it all in 1 go to get the best gift. Combine purchases with friends as well to get over the threshold. Otherwise, the gifts you get with small purchases (under 30,000) aren't that good (sheet masks, small samples of moisturiser or toner, cotton makeup remover pads). You could have got all that just by browsing a few shops.  There are a lot of food places, lots of snacks, and generally a lot going on. Make sure you keep your valuables in sight at all times. Enjoy!"
1376,5.0,"This seems to the shopping area for the younger crowd with plenty of clothing, shoe, and cosmetic shops. The girls in our group were in some sort of makeup nirvana as we were informed that Korean cosmetics are state of the art and so inexpensive that they were practically free. Many reasonably priced restaurants throughout plus some street food at night. Add a few crazy religious types howling at the soon to be damned shoppers and you have a great afternoon or evening before you."
1377,3.0,"I think it goes without saying Myeongdong is the paradise for girls. You can find all cosmetics brands there and many boutiques. However, I was quite shocked to see the food stalls at night and they were all the way up to the end of the main shopping street. And I was quite surprised to see most of them were run by Chinese! Anyhow, still a must go for tourists."
1378,5.0,"Myeongdong is a night market and some stores are open till 4:30 AM. I suggest that you come here with an empty stomach because even if you only intended to shop, you won't help but eat something from the food street. The prices are quite expensive (eg 3000 KRW for a palm-size fish shape cake with nutella inside) but they're good and the stalls are very hygienic. Plus it's the best place to really experience Seoul street food.  The stores are not really group accordingly but most of the cosmetics shops like Etude House (there's two stores there), Nature Republic, Tony Moly, etc. are close together so it's easy to compare products and stuff. There are a lot of stalls along the streets selling clothes but there are also clothes stores like Forever 21 (2 floors of it) and some other Korean brands that can be found there. In the same building as Forever 21, there are two floors of restaurants also so if you don't feel like eating street food you can go there. There's California Pizza Kitchen and other Asian/Korean restaurants there. There are also surprisingly dog and cat cafes there which was fun and other cafes (which you can find basically anywhere in Seoul) like Paris Baguette. It's also around 15 min walk away from a street that sells teacup pets, mostly dogs. You'll see lines of shops there along that street.  The best way to get to main street is through the subway, cuz it's just right there when you go out."
1379,4.0,Great food and shops but a little chaotic and really crowded. Overall we are glad we checked it out but definitely need high energy to make it out alive!
1380,1.0,This street is to visited after 6 pm when all the hawkers are opning their carts. All kind of foods can be tasted. It is open up to 10 pm. The ambiance is nice.
1381,4.0,Overall this is a good place for shopping with lots of eateries around. I will not recommend to eat the street food here although the taste of the food is quite good but most of it are just overpriced. If you really looking for a meal I will suggest u to go for a restaurant instead.
1382,4.0,"We were drown in foods and after two or three stalls, we already full. You can eat almost a wide selection of seoul street food in here. The price is average high ($3-5 per item). After having your stomach full, you can jump in cosmetic shops, clothes, shoes..."
1383,4.0,The whole shopping district seems dedicated to looking good. Coffee shops and make-up stores abound. But the most interesting to me were the dog and cat cafes where for the price of a cup of coffee you could visit with dogs or cats. What fun!
1384,5.0,"This is a one stop shopping for cosmetic goods. All korean brand are here, full and loud. The food also great, the street food is a so so"
1385,5.0,"Great market. This place has everything, clothes, shoes, jewelry, Korean crafts, food. Very busy. Some English spoken"
1386,4.0,"Yes, you can buy anything and everything in Seoul. As long as you have a lot of money. When it comes to retail prices I thing it is even higher than Tokyo."
1387,5.0,"If you love Korean Makeup and would love to shop, Myeondong is the place. Everything here is Makeup - innisfree, étude house, tony moly, olive young, skinfood, missha, etc. Anything Korean Makeup related is here. Plus there are a lot of Street food and cafes around the area."
1388,4.0,Went to myeongdong to do some shopping. Was surprised to find mostly modern shops. There were name brands along with Korean brands. There are also lots of places to eat along the small alley ways.
1389,4.0,"Many local Korean skincare shops! Fascinating experience walking through many streets with similar stuff!  Seems like negotiation is possible, especially if you can speak mandarin, most of the shops have staff from northern china.. a nice place to spend some time, especially at night when there are many small snacks shops"
1390,5.0,"Myeongdong is a shopping mecca for cosmetics, beauty and skin care products. Just cant choose from the varied beauty care brands that abound the streets! Aside from the Cosmetics shops, branded and signature shops line the streets Lots of tourists though and at night, its too crowded to shop around. I suggest to come early to avoid the rush. There are tourism people to ask around for directions if you get lost."
1391,4.0,"This was an absolute of shopping! Having gone shopping at the Namdaemun Market over several days, this was a refreshing change. There are food carts galore and street vendors. But, there is an array (some repetitive) of shops and restaurants. There are several of the same face product stores on the same block so we got lost using stores as the landmarks. This market housed higher end stores and some of the trendier Korean shops. We tried to eat street food as much as possible (because there is so much of it) but the one thing we had several of on different shopping trips are the 32cm ice cream cones. They came on a cone or in a cup topped on some dry cereal. We tried all the flavors from different vendors. Yum!! In the clothing stores they don't allow trying on of the clothes. Me being a larger sized woman I was hesitant to buy tops without trying them on first. It was such a hustle and bustle kind of crowd so be ready yo go with the flow of shoppers!"
1392,5.0,"This shopping street is amazing, especially for beauty products, skin care, masks!!! and more activities in the evening, a lot of street food booths, and it is a fun place to walk around and have food & drinks."
1393,3.0,"I was disappointed with the shopping on offer as the choice was very limited-there are hundreds of shops but most are branches of the same brands, so you'll see 5 Olive Young's, 5 Etude Houses,etc. Some flagship stores but quality was poor.On the plus side, shop assistants were not pushy and lots of street food on offer as well as restaurants and cafes.I'd avoid going on a weekend or a holiday as it was ridiculously crowded which made the experience stressful.Perhaps during the week and earlier in the day it is a much nicer place to explore..."
1394,4.0,"one of the busiest district where you can shop from morning til night. From street food, local markets, cheap outfits to expensive items, skincare, cosmetics, cats and dogs cafe, massage, restaurants of 70 years history to modern fine dining Korean BBQ, you basically can find everything in this district"
1395,4.0,"SO overwhelming to the senses but worth the trip. Lots of free samples from the beauty stores, lots of option for things to buy. If you are going for beauty products, make a list of what you want from each store before you go. Try the street food, explore the shops and be kind to the pressuring sales people. Stop at the cathedral on your way out to take a breather from all the hustle of the streets and shops!"
1396,5.0,"amazing food street area. lot's of restaurants. we went there during Winter time, it was freezing cold by -21Degree celsius. We loved it. Get dressed properly and enjoy the great food."
1397,5.0,"The street food may only be available on the weekends, but definitely make an effort to come here hungry. Cheese scallops, conch on a stick, kimbap and more definitely make for a delicious experience. The interesting restaurants, cat cafes and stores are also quite fun."
1398,5.0,"the amazing thing about the shops are that the staff all speak mandarin! a few may speak English. The fashion stores are interesting and of course we have the cosmetic shops everywhere. Some can do refund of tax on the spot which is really handy, other require you to get it at the airport. but not to worry the tax refund machines are found everywhere in the airport. There is usually a person to help with the machines, they are easy to use anyhow. the night market is pretty fun but I reckon some of the trinkets are overpriced, they are cheaper is the subway shops."
1399,5.0,"We visited most of the markets in Seoul and liked this one the best. It is a nice mix of street food, vendors, and shops. It seems to have both locals and tourists. We a little shopping and a lot of eating."
1400,4.0,Whilst the shops become a little repetitive theere is an endless variety of high quality tasty treats availble with helpful vendors able to explain most of the ingredients and will give a sample if asked. Artbox is a highlight for the kids. Head down to the subway durng the day to get away from the cold and enjoy many arcades of shopping with occasional food outlets.
1401,5.0,"Fun for tourists and locals alike. Interesting street food options. Try some but go to restaurants in the area as Myeongdong offers good Korean-Chinese food as the area used to house the Taiwanese embassy and had many Taiwanese Koreans living in the area. Great local Chinese food restaurants, dim-sums with Korean twist. This is one of the must see unique places in Seoul."
1402,3.0,Crowded with tourists who enjoys street food and cosmetic shopping which is a bit expensive compared from other location (Honggik University shopping street). It is already close to Seoul station and Nandaemun cheap market (with cheaper street foods too)
1403,5.0,The place is teeming with mall stores shops restaurants street foods etc. a good place for shopping eating sightseeing strolling around trying different street food
1404,3.0,"I had a good time, I knew stores would be repeated on several other streets as I walked along. I did find some good deals...however, it to me, was a tourist trap. I mean the streets were wall to wall with people. And I was there during chuseok, a national holiday. I shudder to think what it is like normally. I stayed within walking distance so I was able to shop in other areas and compare what the prices were in Myeongdong. So that was a definite plus, as soon as you say well I am staying here and the price I saw there was...well you've got bargaining power. Make sure you check out MK labs - the troiareuke brand in Myeongdong - exit 9 I believe. I got amazing deals on some serious great skincare."
1405,4.0,"Myeongdong Shopping street is a shopping haven beside the Myeongdong station that is filled with local Korean makeup brands (Nature Republic, Tony Moly, Missha, Innisfree, Face Shop, Etude House, Holika Holika) that offer discounts when products bought cost over 30000 KRW, shoe brands (Footlocker, NB, Nike, Onitsuka Tiger) and other closing stores. Along the street are food stalls that sell all kinds of Korean street foods."
1406,4.0,Amazing amount of shops and market stalls.You can pick up most things here in every price range.A lot of weird and wonderful characters going about
1407,5.0,"This is one of the busiest shopping area for tourists. Beauty products and shops lined up in rows and alleys. Local apparel and shoes stores sprinkled in different corners of the street. You find the latest design of adidas and other popular sneakers here too !  Push carts of food lined the main Myeongdong street starting from the Zara stores.  We have an enjoyable time on Saturday trying tibits and food along this street. Don't take a heavy lunch. You just buy and eat from the push cart. They are hygienic at least for me and my Friend. We were fascinated by a push cart that sell nothing but just Optus and cuttle fish in various form ( grilled, dried and in a cup etc. We tried the pomegranate juice freshly pressed into a plastic bag and a straw. It looks like a fresh blood bag from a blood bank. But the taste is not as sweet as during winter.  We also shop along the way and got bags full of different Brand’s of facial cleansers, masks and facial mist, hair masks etc. There was a Watson store that sell interesting tibits and cosmetic too(items which you can't find in singapore but expensive when purchase online.  A lot of eateries are on the second and 3rd stories of the buildings. Fried chicken, Korean food, Osulloc tea cafe, beer and fried chicken place.  This is a must go place for whoever comes to Seoul. Just to feel the vibe and craziness of the buying bulk of skin care products from tourists from all over the world.  I see more European tourists hovering around the snail based skin care and masks products. Seems like snail is not just for eating, it is for beauty too !"
1408,5.0,"Myeongdong is the place to stay in when visiting Seoul. Its what Shibuya or Shinjuku is for Tokyo. It got the shopping, the street food and is central located to give easy access ot the rest of Seoul. the neighborhood itself is filled with cosmetic/beauty shops and stores aimed for younger people. During the evening the streets fills up with food carts and the place is also packed with restaurants and coffee places. Its also close to Lotte Flagship Department store and the two metro lines gives easy access to the rest of the city. So this is not only a great place for shopping and visiting at nights, but also an excellent point to have as a base since most of the city is within 15 minutes."
1409,4.0,"Shops and shops and shops..... Mostly cosmetics. And in the evening the road is filled with many stalls selling street foods, interesting sight."
1410,4.0,"This is an entire street of shopping from international brands, to local designer brands and low end brands. It offers plenty of restaurants, cafes, and street food all at the same time. Definately spoil for choice. Weekend can get really crowded. As a tourist this is a one stop place to shop till you drop. Shopping heaven a Must come destination when you are in Korea."
1411,2.0,Too much shops and many brands have more than one shop in the area. And they all offer quite the same. Very crowded. Watching people while they are shopping is entertainment as well
1412,3.0,"I went with my family to experience the street food culture. Because we were there for only one night we tried a variety of foods. None of them were amazing sadly.The best (to me) being the deep fried shrimp 새우튀김. The worst beight either the cup 'o flaverless watermelon or the chewy and flavorless Cheese Ricecake 치즈떡.  Being a holiday weekend, the street was crawling with tourists. I think I heard WAY more Chinese than Korean, not that its a good or bad thing. Also, it feels that the stores in Myeongdong cater to young female shoppers. Being a guy in his 30's there was really nothing for me to shop for.  Also, not a great place to bring young children because of the crowd and lack of things that interest them.  If your on a date, maybe a great place to check out."
1413,4.0,"Being a tourist it was nice to shop the basic souvenirs bought in Korea but there were so many people from all over the world. It was almost overwhelming. In saying that, most places spoke broken English which was helpful. Street food is readily available which is nice too. (Chinese and Korean)"
1414,4.0,"Vast number of shops, especially makeup and cosmetics and clothing. There are both high and low-end shops"
1415,4.0,"It was our first family trip to S Korea and we picked Myeondong because of the positive review's from TripAdvisor. We picked Philstay명동 hotel which was ideally located in the Myeondong area, no frills nothing fancy as we were on a budget. The reviews/reviewers for spot on Myeondong is basically a huge shopping paradise ranging from inexpensive item's to upscale name brand's. Huge plus was that were on our hotel was on the street where they have the street foods at night, everything was so affordable around $5 or less and so delicious and so much variety. I would absolutely recommend experiencing this area of Myeondong to anyone!"
1416,4.0,"Place to stock up on your beauty products, there are brands like Laneige, Nature Republic, Skin Food, Face Shop, Etude house and the list goes on. There is a Shinsegae dept store (more luxury branded ) too. If you get any beauty products, usually the stores will give u some samples or they call it ""service""."
1417,4.0,"I could see wave of people there, it's too much so I got scared to get inside literally but you can find many street food and shops, it seems you can get everything there! Oh it has good restaurants,too Myeongdong gyoja, andong jjimdak, maple tree house, meoksidonna-Ddeokbboggi restaurant! Try them! they are really good! :)"
1418,4.0,"Tourists everywhere (esp. Mainland China). Large open-air walking streets. Mostly Korean-brand cosmetics at 'heavily discounted tourist prices' (meaning if u buy more, u get better discounts or freebies). Good place to savour local snacks & food from make-shift stalls & carts. Easily accessible via subway."
1419,3.0,"The skincare shops that can be found here are easily available in many different districts such as Hongdae and Edae. From what I observed, the sales people in Myeongdong are a lot pushier too, especially if they think that you're from China. Worth the visit for the experience but you can easily shop at other districts."
1420,5.0,Many beauty shops and cafe! Or if you just want to enjoy the surrounding you can walk and try street food. Easy to reach by train or bus.

1422,3.0,"A very lively and energetic market place, is definitely fun to witness whilst your stay in Seoul, but.... it's very obvious that the shops are targeting Chinese tourists? There's even shop staff yelling in Chinese about a sale of something. It's still worth a visit but you wouldn't be thrilled."
1423,3.0,"This shopping area can be skip to my opinion, nothing special over here, the university shopping street is much better,"
1424,4.0,"This is a place that you definitely cannot miss. It's a vibrant shopping street selling lots of varied stuff. Even if you don't like to shop, just go there and take a look to have a feel of Seoul."
1425,5.0,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is a great place to buy Korean brand cosmetics. During our 7 days trip in South Korea, my wife visited here more than thrice and at every visit she bought something.

1426,5.0,"It's winter time to visit Souel. The white snow is like the ladies skin color. This is a fashion chic and pop cultural area. Very impressed with their creative ability. I found out that KOrean are also very active for their fashion, designs, foods culture. If you want to see the trendy fashion, then this is it. Trying some awesome local foods, sea foods and enjoy the fashion aroma there."
1427,5.0,"I've visited Hongdae, Myeongdong, and Gangnam, and Myeongdong is by far my favorite neighborhood.  To start, Hongdae has many food stops and sells mostly off brand clothing. Myeongdong has multiple stores as well as a huge variety of street food along every large street. Gangnam is much more modern and gives an upper class vibe, since the streets are cleaner and it's not as freely chaotic as Myeongdong.  For me, Myeongdong was the perfect balance of Seoul's street culture as well as their huge options of clothes and skin care products. It's really fun seeing one skin care store within a 5 minute walking distance of each other.  Myeongdong is lively at night, so make sure you get a chance to get at that time too!"
1428,4.0,"If you love local street food, this is the place. It is exit 6 from Myeongdong station. Has a few good souvenir markets as well as great big stores e.g Zara, converse etc. Great place, super good vibe!"
1429,4.0,"This is definitely a shopping place, for food , clothes, comestic etc there are night market u can explore the food while shopping. Not too bad, is a commercial shopping street, nothing to expect."
1430,4.0,"Very convenient for buying Korean cosmetic brands - many stores of the same brand within walking distance of one another. Take your time to test out products and the staff are usually very helpful ( if you speak Mandarin, staff can give product information in more details). Always ask for more freebies if you intend to buy larger quantities. If you shop at Aritaum, Olive Young, Innisfree and Too cool for School and purchase at least KRW30,000, you get immediate tax refund off your purchase price- so no need to claim tax refund at airport. But do confirm at the cashier before making payment.  The food stalls at the shopping street are not cheap and quality so-so. Better off saving the money and eating at more established and quality eateries in vicinity.  There are many stores of established hair salon chains in the area where you can rest and do your hair in between shopping. There should usually be someone who can speak Mandarin ( I went to a salon early one morning and the Mandarin speaking staff wasn't around and they telephoned a translator to speak with me so they could understand what style I wanted(nothing Beats showing them a picture though ) - talk about service !) or very basic English. Prices are not much more expensive than Singapore."
1431,3.0,The usual high end shopping but beware of people fiddling with their phone and colliding with each other. Lots of choice but tends to be on the expensive side for some Europeans.
1432,5.0,"Best place to shop for skincare products and cosmetics. Ensure you have a luggage with you but if you don't, they do sell luggages at the subway station. Some cosmetic shops have promotion giving away luggage if you spent a certain amount. Food stalls will be opened later part of the day. There are Halal options available! Only thing is that rubbish bins are difficult to find but the place is still clean. Do carry with you extra plastic bag to throw the rubbish first while looking for rhe thrash bin."
1433,3.0,"This place is bustling with people especially after sunset. Has lots of cheap stuff like shoes, bags, souvenirs. However, quality is bad! Street food didn't look great and didn't have the guts to try it (possibility of getting sick). My wife told me make up and beauty products were good and reasonable prices. Again, you can visit one time for the experience of crowded and cheap stuff, however, I'm not sure if I'll visit again..."
1434,5.0,"This district was a shocker to me. I didnt expect that much in one particular district. If you into food, fashion in a Asian style environment, please experience Myeondong!!!"
1435,4.0,"You can buy everything you needed here. Shops offer immediate tax refund with a passport. Most shops have salesperson who can speak Chinese, not English. I went there in during weekday, not crowded. Weather in late Aug is very pleasant too."
1436,5.0,Lots glitz and glamour to be found here. Almost all the cosmetics and skincare products you can think of can be found here...  Be warned the streetfood... while tempting.... is very pricey and it's satisfying enough just to share among friends...  I had a good bbq meal up above the streets next to Starbucks... It's more value than the streetfood.
1437,5.0,"I went there by myself, NOT with a tour.  This is a perfect location for the cosmetics/skincare lovers to shop for their favourate brands such as Tony Moly, Holika Holika, The Face Shop, Innisfree, Etude House, Nature Republic, ARITAUM and Olive young etc.  Tips: The promoters usually provide free sample to get your attention and most brands provides Get 1 Free 1 promotions. Some promoters emphasized it was the last day of the promotion and tried to convince payment asap but the promotion went on everywhere and I didn't see any difference for the whole week. So just make sure you have a clear mind before making any purchase - it was tempting to have those offers and there was always a better deals with more purchase.  Personally I would recommend to visit during the evening with all street stalls out selling amazing popular Korean street food.  Tips: Make sure you visit with an empty stomach if you enjoy Korean street food"
1438,4.0,"When in Seoul a trip to Myeondong is must. What do you get? Lots and lots of beauty products stores, fashion stores, interesting street food and yes lots of Chinese tourist with huge bags to pack there beauty products shopping.  Between the Chinese you will get to see the beautiful Korean teenagers.  I like the buzz and the amazing range of street food presented in interesting way. Korean today is exporters of new food trends to the world and you get to see them first at this area  Watch out for a new way of serving ice cream in a cone which looks like a rose flower."
1439,4.0,Good place to visit. A lot of things to buy . Cheap& good. A lot of restaurants for traveller to choose . Good taste and reasonable prices.
1440,4.0,"Bargain place for cosmetics and clothing . Last week were summer sale period, I got a great offer for korea masks, get many samples given by the sales girl. Go after lunch time. by the time we walked for so many stores and try on different masks, in the evening, time to eat more street foods. Never miss this."
1441,5.0,"We stay in Myeongdong area. It is a cosmetics heaven! Almost all korean brands available there. You can also enjoy street food along the street and back to shop again. Many good restaurants in Myeongdong, such as: Myeongdong Kyoja, Yoogane, etc. Down the street, you can also find beautiful Catholic Church."
1442,5.0,"i really enjoyed walking through different streets with huge shopping variation. The streetfood is excellent too, tobokki in myeongdong is also worth trying!"
1443,4.0,It's very crowded lots of shops though they pretty much selling the same stuff. Important to remember not to eat at any of the local restaurants without asking for the actual pricing. We were shocked when we were charged almost us$250 for a three course meals for 2 at a bbq restaurant. Menu stated price apparently is for per person as what we were told. 2 beef slices cost us $150 can u believe e it? We tried another restaurant n asked for the price which was confirmed while ordering. When settling bill we were again charged double and you can argue till the vow comes home but still landed paying it.
1444,3.0,Its easy to get to this shopping area on the metro We weren’t very impressed by the range or the prices. We understood that Seoul shopping is amongst the best I have found better quality at lower prices in other parts of SeAsia but the experience and foot weary expedition provided an interesting afternoon
1445,5.0,"Though the streets were packed with shoppers, it was still clean and orderly. Endless stores of beauty products at affordable prices. We also enjoyed the street food that were offered in the afternoon."
1446,4.0,"It is quite happening when the night falls and there are lots of street food to try. You can definitely shop your cosmetics products here at reasonable price and remember to ask for tax refund! However, the street foods are quite pricey. There are a few decent restaurants here as well which you can try."
1447,2.0,the street is very crowded. most Chinese visit the street and buy something. but Koreans is where a short visit.
1448,4.0,"During the day, its very crowded and lots of different cosmetic shops with people trying to pull you in to buy stuff. On the plus side, they give you free masks if you buy something. The strange thing here is that there a multiple branches of the same shop only a few doors away from each other. This street is a shopping Mecca for those looking for cosmetics. The night market is the best here. Great atmosphere with lots of street food and the main street shops also stay open very late."
1449,5.0,Awesome experience Whenever I have visitors this is on our to do list It is always jammed pack The locals love to bargain Good street food Easy to get dropped off and picked up by taxi
1450,2.0,"This is a narrow shopping street with lots of vendors crammed in. The product quality is very low. The was a wide range of items - food, clothing, electronics etc"
1451,4.0,"Myeongdong is Korea's ultimate shopping destination. Whatever you are looking for, chances are, you'll find it in Myeongdong. It helps that the streets are compact, you do not have to do much walking to get around. Korean cosmetics brands - Nature Republic, Innisfree, Etude House, The Face Shop, etc. all have multiple stores here and they give out free samples to entice you in. The Migliore in Myeongdong (below Loisir Hotel) has even better prices than the Migliore in Dongdaemun.  Myeongdong is also where you can get the best rates from money changers. We changed money a few times here and were satisfied with the rates we got. We found that those on the second floor usually give better rates. There are also reputable eateries here like Myeongdong Kyoja. The range of the Artbox here is not as good as the ones in Hongdae or Edae, so I would not recommend shopping at the branch here.  The Lotte Young Plaza and Lotte Mart are also nearby. In the afternoon, street stalls se up and sell their wares. Namsan and N Seoul Tower is also within walking distance, if you want to take a break from the bustle of all the shopping. If you are staying in the area, I suggest choosing a place right in the middle of the shopping streets and not on the side of Pacific Hotel/Hotel Prince, to be closer to the action."
1452,4.0,"for anyone whom is into Korean skincare, this is THE place to go. Would have given 5 stars if there are more variety as you do get a lot of repeated brand even on the same street."
1453,2.0,"I noticed there were a lot of visited foreigners and very few locals shopped and bought their staffs there. The street food price tag is more expensive, for e.g. a fruit juice cost me only W2,000 when I bought it near my Hotel, but it costs W4,000 from this street.  I managed to find a few very small food stalls located at the back lane of the street, which offered excellent taste and good price local food.  Tip: follow the locals and do not choose a restaurant full of foreigners."
1454,1.0,"Night time after dinner, walk around for window shopping. Right at the corner, there is a ice cream seller. If you female, plus nice looking. Be ware of the guy selling ice cream. Umm...."
1455,4.0,My son & I explored the market & really enjoyed seeing all the food stalls & great shops. Very interesting.
1456,5.0,"Definitely one of the highlights of our trip. We arrived at Myeondong at around 6:30 pm. Just in time for the street food vendors to start selling their gastronomic creations. Moving from stall to stall and sampling food from grilled scallops topped with melted cheese to the barbecued steak and bulgogi was just wonderful. The food was also relatively cheap (between KW2000-KW8000 per order or $1.75-$7/ order). The money changer in Myeondong (the one next to the subway exit across the street from Lotte Young) , in my experience, had the best conversion rates. I will definitely be going back to this place when I visit Korea again."
1457,4.0,"A shopping haven for ladies! You have shops giving free masks to lure you into the shop. Be careful as they are very good sales people and you might end up buying more than you bargained for. It was a nice shopping experience even if you just want to window shop. There's a lot of street food at night, starting about 3pm. The restaurants however, food, not so lovely. Almost double the price from elsewhere in Seoul, it also doesn't taste as good. Very tourisy restaurants. I would suggest go shopping here, go somewhere else for food."
1458,5.0,"The most shopper friendly shopping street with food and shops at every corner. It was rather easy navigating the streets too unlike other districts where you feel like you are going round in circles or there is nothing much to do. Plenty of food push carts along the way too. They have a 3 level Nature Republic and Olive Young, a good place to get your seaweed snacks also. On top of that you can get a clear view of the Seoul Tower."
1459,5.0,"This market is AMAZING for any person that enjoys shopping, they mostly have make up Korean stores, but you will also find H&M, Zara, Forever21 and others, also a lot of street food ( every booth is very clean ).  You can easily spend here the whole afternoon with no problem at all, they have several cat cafe which i highly recommend to visit and one dog cafe which is amazing ( the cat cafe has an entrance fee of 8000 won and the dog cafe 9000 both include a drink with the entrance).  I will recommend to come at night from Tuesday to Sunday, on Mondays not all the street vendors are there.  Myeong-dong subway station exit 7"
1460,5.0,"There were many, many stores that sold local goods. My son and dad ate street food which they enjoyed. Some store owners will haggle and others were not."
1461,4.0,"Unless you have a very patient boyfriend or husband, leave them in the hotel or a coffe shop close by. I certainly did and so glad that I did. This gave me time to shop at different brands, tried out samples and bargained for the best price with the most free samples. A good afternoon work and thoroughly enjoyable!"
1462,3.0,"Only visit if you have limited shopping time and looking for cosmetics and skincare. They do have almost all the korean brands here. As it is famous for shopping street, you will see all the tourist here (especially from Mainland China). Shop attendants will start greeting you in Chinese too.. Experienced very bad service as they will product push to you and once we dont buy, their face will turn really sour! Shops on the main streets will not give you product samples or disclose the promotion deals unless u ask for it. I get much more product samples, discount deals, and other perks fr shopping at the same brand stores located at other areas like Garosugil and Hongdae. Shoppers, be aware! Food prices are also higher when compared to other areas. With same price, you can get better quality food at other places."
1463,5.0,"You will never be bored here. It is the ladies' dream shopping area and the boyfriend/hubby's nightmare. There are so many different cosmetics and facial products to be bought. There are many street vendors too. I bought clothes for my dogs and hats for myself from them. When you are tired, you can dine at the many restaurants found there."
1464,3.0,"If you like the hustle and bustle and bright shiny lights this is the place for you. Comes alive at night although day is also great for people watching. Be prepared to be lured into beauty stores flogging all sorts of dodgy treatments, masks and anything you can imagine to achieve beauty and everlasting youth. Otherwise trendy brand name stores at retail prices and fairly touristy eating places. The foot long parfait / ice cream vendor was popular on a hot day"
1465,4.0,"I have visited Myeongdong now several times, and I think I prefer going to eat streetfood and not so much for shopping because it's a mess when it comes to shopping, also its really touristy. Their are resources avaliable if you need English/Chinese/Japanese translation. Definetly a must see for a trip to Seoul, just to experience it, once during the day and at night!"
1466,4.0,"Touristy is good in that all the shops are there so if you have a list of things you want it's pretty easy to knock it down there, because there are 10 of each shop (innisfree, laneige, etude house etc etc) at every corner you turn. The bad side was that I think there were more foreigners than koreans there, so I would only treat it purely as a 'shop and get out of there' kind of place. If you can speak chinese and not korean, this place is great because all the staff speak chinese to some extent."
1467,5.0,Definitely very enjoyable to shop here. Wide variety of international brands and Korean fashion and cosmetics. Lots of street food as well ! Enjoy eating and drinking your way through this shopping haven !!
1468,4.0,"If you are cosmetic shopping gals, you definitely love this shopping district. Lots of beauty shops that you can buy stuff from; but street food can be pricey."
1469,5.0,Great area for shopping not far from metro underground from seoul station. Nice surroundings and great food and coffee shops. Worth a visit.
1470,4.0,"It's a very popular street, it's an amazing place where you can find street food and a lotoof shops to buy the last new special facial mask or the new cream for your face or hands! If you go to Seoul you must go there!"
1471,5.0,"I visited this area during the day and at night. If you want a laid-back shopping experience, I highly recommend going during the day. But the night shopping is wonderful! The area has a ton of cafes and restaurants to choose from. This includes dog and cat cafes. They have vendors that sell street food and tourist gifts in the streets as well as plenty of stores with clothing and beauty products. I highly recommend Myeongdong, even if you just want to walk around!"
1472,5.0,"Be it fashion, hair salon, makeup, skincare, restaurants, or souvenirs, Myeongdong street has everything! You can't be bored coming here and will end up buying things! Korean makeup stores are in every corner of the street and offer good deals of makeup and skincare. If you're looking for clothes, 8 seconds and topten are my recommendations!"
1473,5.0,Go on a weekend late afternoon for the best picks of food n everything else. The tourist information offers free hanbok try-outs. Just go n book a time. Also lots of information guides around to help😀
1474,5.0,"lots of awesome street food, every night of the week, lots of cosmetic shops and well as clothes etc. must visit at least once during your visit to seoul, to see all the young people out shopping and having fun"
1475,5.0,"Each of the shopping areas/streets are different and offer their own charm. Though it seems to be geared toward beauty products, there are still options for every need/want. We stopped through on the way to N Seoul Tower and was a lot of fun."
1476,5.0,"Great spot for the full-on assault of consumerism - mostly clothes and shoe and cosmetic shops. This is not the place for the chic Seoul boutiques or hand-crafts but if you want big brands and lots of them, spend a few hours here. If you like street food, come here at night - it's very vibrant and great fun and the food is good. Wash it down with a beer or two at one of the bars - happy days :-)"
1477,5.0,There are so many things to do here. Mostly you will find shops selling cosmetics and skincare products. Some fashion shops scattered around. I prefer to do my fashion shopping at dongdaenum area. You will be approached by many touters from restaurants. Try to avoid these restaurants. The food tends to be lousy and expensive. Walk around and seek the busiest looking restaurants. Those are the ones you want to try.
1478,5.0,"Cheaper than dongdaenum shopping area. I bought a pair of shorts for krw 10,000 and when I went to myeongdong it was only kwn 5,900! A lot of street food and cheap clothes ( but i suggest you go around and compare prices). Definitely will come back to this place again especially for shopping."
1479,3.0,"Very vibrant shopping street with all major Korean cosmetic brands. The Olive Young Store with 2 levels is a convenient place to get everything in one spot, especially if you are looking for a variety of face masks! Most of the sales staff seemed to understand Mandarin."
1480,4.0,"Some tips... If you are looking for money changer, try to find some in alley not in a main street. The rate is favourable especially for USD. It is quite a fun street shopping and we find it cheap rather than japan and singapore. The food is best in alley.. Some bbq place near mcd is good and reasonable prices."
1481,4.0,Lots of shops to go as well as kind of nights market s with foods and goodies sold. It is very happening especially at night. every day of the week. we went 3 times and always new things to discover. shop till you die lol
1482,5.0,"Very good shopping place. came here for 4 times over 6 days in Seoul. The place is packed with good food, famous joints and good shopping with decent price points :)"
1483,4.0,"You can get lost in myeongdong! My hotel was at the heart of myeongdong shopping street and we go out every night for food and explore the shops. Majority shops sells cosmetics and facial masks and they all the same. Buy 1 get 1 free or 50% off is very common and if you work out the prices, they are all the same! So if you going to buy facial masks, buy from their official store to avoid any fakes. Food is great! many restaurants to try and different types as well. Price wise, Korean bbq is expensive and street food is expensive because they give you very small portions. If you like ttekboki I suggest you buy from Myeongdong station underground shops (same price but gave you double the amount of food). You can still bargain in myeongdong but they won't discount it that much.... This place is pretty much filled with Chinese tourist! If you don't speak Korean but speaks Chinese, you're OK! They always speak some chinese...."
1484,2.0,"over crowded and chaotic, my least favourite walking street in Seou. Unless you really want to get the cheap Korean face masks, i would rather give it a miss..."
1485,4.0,"Myeongdong is the main shopping district of Seoul, but it offers much more than just shopping. While you can find many major brands stores here, there are plenty of street food vendors, restaurants, and bars. It is worth coming here to people watch, eat, and window shop and just take in the hustle and bustle."
1486,5.0,"Not only shopping but street food paradise. A lot of beauty stores are everywhere. Zara, H&M, Forever 21 located along the main road. There are also hundreds of local fashion small shops around. Choose the one u like more. You won't be left hungry if you prefer restaurants rather than street food. Though the prices there are a bit higher than in other parts of Seoul. For pets lovers there are Cat Cafes and Dog Cafes, i visited both and advise you to do the same :)"
1487,5.0,"The Myeongdong area is known for shopping, in particular for make-up. There are numerous stores like Missha, Nature Republic, Etude House, Innis, H&M, and Zara. As a foreigner living in Seoul or a tourist this is a great place to get the best of Korean make-up products and those western clothing stores you might need. But secretly, my wife and I go there for the street food. It is always jam packed, even in the cold months of Fall with food vendors. You can try out the latest trend or just get the classics like a crepe. Check out this area for a unique experience of shopping and food!"
1488,5.0,Myeong-dong is a definitely a shopping paradise. It has almost everything. There are endless rows of cosmetic shops to local and international fashion to pretty restaurants that nestled in between the rows of shops to delicious local snacks.  All the Korean cosmetic brands can be found within 50 metres from each other. Prices are really affordable and the cosmetic shops here are more generous with freebies and samples.  Best place for shopaholics!
1489,5.0,This shopping area is full of cosmetics shops and nice restaurants to have your meals at. There are many cosmetic shops of the same brand name all over Myeongdong.
1490,4.0,This place is where you want to go for endless rows of beauty products and fashionable clothing shops. Restaurants and money changers are plenty as well. Street food stalls are also abundant.
1491,5.0,here you can find all kind of famous Korean brands selling clothes or cosmetics and many types of food and restaurants. also there are many types of fresh and delicious street food that i recommend you try all. there are also money exchange stores with the best exchange rates you can find in seoul so i recommend you exchange your money here but look for different stores to get the best rate
1492,5.0,"This street is known for stores selling skin care products. Most stores will give you free samples just for coming in. Go there your first day in Seoul, walk in and out of stores, get free sample and try it out at night back in your hotel room. You might one to pick up a facial mask or too to try if you don't get one as a free sample. On the second to last day in Seoul, buy the products you tried AND liked to take home. Given the ubiquity of the products and the conversion rate, it is incredibly inexpensive compared to what you would pay in the US. for example, a floral based mask at Sephora sells for $4 each. With the buy 10 get 10 free specials there, each mask averaged out to 50 cents!!!! These shops are all over Seoul, you don't have to go the myeongdong again. It's good for the first day because of the concentration of shops; you can hit so many stores in a short period of time. Additionally, because the stores are so concentrated there, the competition to get you into the stores are more intense, hence, all the free samples."
1493,5.0,"So many shops on sale! Seriously a shopping heaven for ladies mainly! Shopping ends up being addictive here at this market and we couldn't stop! When we left around 11pm, shops were all still open."
1494,5.0,"convenient and dynamic shopping area. from big malls, chain stores to local stores, you can buy almost everything here. most tax refund centres are in the area, which is great for travelers; even better, quite a number of shops do direct tax refund thus save you all the troubles."
1495,5.0,"We really enjoyed going to Myeongdong Shopping street which is just across our hotel The Pacific Hotel. There is a lot of action here, lots of tourists, lots of street food and of course lots of shopping. When in Korea, this is a place that you shouldn't miss."
1496,5.0,"A must visit if you travel to Seoul. The place was famous for middle range branded shopping such as Zara and H&M. There's a lot of cosmetics shops and sport store like Nike. So it's fun to spend the whole evening shopping and enjoy the also famous street food. There's ice cream, sausages, eggbread, and various fruits. If you don't feel to have street foods, there's also lots of restaurants. Lastly clothes and souvenirs also available here."
1497,5.0,"The de facto area to shop for cosmetics and beauty products. However, the selection of restaurants and food that can be found here is amazing. If you only have one area to visit and want to try all types of Korean delicacies, this is the area. Moreover, in the evening till night, the streets are lined with streeet stalls selling street food to fashion wares. Shopping can also be done in this area if you don't have time to head to other popular tourist areas. Almost everything popular in Korea can be found here."
1498,4.0,"Myeongdong is one of the place that you can get your Korean cosmetic product, by o mean you can still get it at other place but Myeongdong has most of the store which easily to grab. It was really crowded during Friday and every stalls try to sell their product. You will see more than 2 Skin Food or Etude House store. This place similar to Causeway Bay in Hong Kong but bigger and crowded with a lot of people carry big luggage to shop. A lot of restaurant and street food vendor as well so if you like to shop and eat at the same time, Myeongdong is the perfect place for you. We stopped by here almost 4-5 times because it was nearby our hotel so better come early in the morning to shop before it gets crowded."
1499,5.0,"I normally don't review this way, but I have to hand it to the Koreans that their street market is amongst the best I have ever visited. It's impossible to make your way through the whole thing in one visit unless you make an entire day out of it.. But you really could.. The best street food from sweet bread with eggs over easy to cheese bbq on sticks with honey drizzle.. Everything I put in my mouth was better than the last. Don't forget the mile high ice creams along the walk.. Plenty of souvenir shops and even places where you can dunk your feet to have little fish eat off the callouses.. It's everything you could ever want in a street market and more!!! A+"
1500,5.0,"It definitely is a great place for shopping because you'll find all famous Korean brands here. There are a lot of beauty/cosmetic shops such as Etude House, Missha, Holika Holika, Aritaum, Primera, etc. Most shop assistants know Mandarin. There's also the LINE flagship store with all the cute products of line characters. In mid-May it was not too crowded, so it was a nice shopping experience."
1501,5.0,"Lively and vibrant place. Alive, busy, and bustling at night. You can find so many shops in Myeongdong. From food to fashion to cosmetics - it's a place to be for shopping and dining. You must visit this place!"
1502,5.0,"A place that one cannot miss it for beauty freak.. You are able to grab any beauty products on any of the streets. There might be 3-5 outlets of each brand around the vicinity. Different type of foods can be found too... Vibrant night shopping area!!! Never-ending crowds!! If you gonna purchase a lot of beauty products, best to stay around the vicinity."
1503,4.0,"There is so much going on in Myeongdong that sometimes it's hard to pay attention. Tons of shops, restaurants and things to see. Pretty noisy, with all the music, people in the streets hawking their wares, etc. It's a great place to explore, but crowded all the time!"
1504,5.0,Came here at night for a taste of local street foods. My tour guide showed me this place. It was very crowded with local people and was very fun. There were lots of food carts selling local delicacies at cheap prices. There were lots of mom and pop shops selling all sorts of things at prices cheaper than at retail stores. I highly recommend this place at anytime of the day. Tip: try the hot dog wieners dipped with assorted flavoring. DELICIOUS!!! My favorite was the garlic and corn.
1505,5.0,"Full of clothing, shoe, cosmetic shops, restaurants, street vendors and a theater. Look down the side streets as they have lots more shops etc. Very safe (police station at entrance), and has an English speaking church at the other end."
1506,5.0,"If you visit Seoul, you will most certainly visit Myeongdong. Lots of shops, although plenty of repeat cosmetic shops. There are lots of sports, clothes shops and plenty of F&B outlets.  There are always a lot of tourists around the area and if it is your first time visiting, you might feel pretty stressed out by the immense activities all around. Duck into shops to get some relief from the crowd on the streets and take your time."
1507,5.0,After visiting the N Seoul tower I ventured around Myeongdong. The underground shops at first look quite ordinary but led to an underground food heaven. The choice and quality of food was amazing. After eating lunch I went back up to the street level where there were food stalls everywhere and shops to suit all kinds of tastes. If you wander around long enough you will find back alleys that sell everything from clothes to souvenirs. A morning trip to the tower and the afternoon around the shops is a good way to spend the day.
1508,5.0,This place is a heaven for shopaholics and makeup + skincare lovers. The prices of the makeup products and skincare products are reasonable. The street food were awesome as well. You should visit the cat cafe as well. We had a great time there. Visit this place after your visit to namsan tour.
1509,5.0,"Shopping shopping and more shopping of korean beauty products. Lots of big brands here and they have more or less 3-4 of same brand boutique stores like Laneige, tonymoly, missha, nature republic , etude house and more. Everywhere u go is about shopping . They also give free samples if u will just take a look inside their store.. But of course it entices u to shop and try their brand :-) I love the nature republic store. It is also in this his area that we found a very good korean bbq restaurant- hmmmm yummy the samgyeopsal... Just a block from Loisir hotel. I definitely want to be back here. 3 days isnt enough :-)"
1510,5.0,It feels like you can spend a week there shopping and you still won't get enough!! If you prefer to shop quietly I suggest you to go in the morning. Most of the shops are open about 9-ish. If you want to try all the yummy street food then you should go after 6pm!! It's a crazy and wonderful adventure!
1511,5.0,There is a lot of food stall if you happn to be there not during rainy day.I repeat the same place during my second night just to try their street food and it was awesome.
1512,5.0,"Crowded street with great varieties of beauty products, cafe, restaurants and etc. Must visit place when you r in Seoul, especially ladies."
1513,4.0,"Noisy street day and night where you can find amazing traditional Korean street food such as grilled octopus, some crab things, fish and sweets. Prices vary, some are highly unreasonable but food is just beyond imagination."
1514,4.0,"If you're visiting South Korea and you want to do some premium shopping, this is the place. Packed with people, mostly tourists, on weekends and weekdays. You can find all the big brands in Myeongdong, as well as street vendors selling cute,cheap goods. If you want good deals, and more elbow room, ask the locals for alternatives. Lots of interesting street food to try as well."
1515,5.0,Endless shopping and never ending street food stalls. A great place for buying various brands and type of beauty products.  Line Friends store is a hit too as many people take a chance at photographing the huge Line bear.
1516,2.0,"the street is lined with shops that can be found everywhere else in Seoul so why do you have to go to Myeongdong specifically? Things get sold out faster too due to the influx of people, not to mention crowded.  I am female and I got bored in less than an hour, go figure.  Check out this quaint congee place near the tip of the main shopping strip (opposite of the Shinsegae end) though, it's good! 3rd Floor."
1517,5.0,"In Seoul, Myeongdong Main Street is where you can find good food, cosmetic and even nice cheap clothes~  If you are a huge cosmetic buyer like me, then I would definitely recommend you to stay near Myeongdong area!  Many friends of mine was like asking me, aren't you worried of the language barrier when you walk into a shop!?! I replied them, nope! because in Myeongdong, every cosmetic brands will definitely have a staffs who speak Chinese, English or even Japanese language! So you don't have to worry if you are unable to communicate with them to buy the best products for yourself!  I have been to Seoul for 4 times and language barrier wasn't my problem at all. I totally enjoyed talking to all the sales staffs in Korea!  During my recent trip, I realize that some of the cosmetic stores actually do immediate tax refund for you during your payment which is totally a good thing! But don't forget you have to make a purchase of 30,000won then you can do your tax refund. Some of the cashiers may not know that you are a tourists, so do remember to ask them if they have tax refund as well.  Some dessert places you have to visit is Sulbing & O'sulloc Tea House!! You will never regret going to those places!! And definitely try all their street food in Myeongdong! It's fantastic!  Hope everyone who is going to visit Myeongdong will have a great day shopping!!"
1518,5.0,"Myeongdong has a lot of great shopping, even if a lot of it is the same shops repeated multiple times (I'm looking at you, Etude House). But the best part was the evening market with all of it's booths of goods and STREET FOOD. Be sure to hit what I consider to be the highlights- strawberry mochi and the fried honey pancakes (hotteok, if I'm not butchering the romanization). You could eat dinner on the street every night and never repeat a dish. From the look and smell of it, they'd all be delicious!"
1519,5.0,"Shopping, dining, shopping, dining~thats what you do in seoul really and this place has got almost everything you need."
1520,4.0,Ohhh...no electronics shops...but lots of street foods from 5pm onwards. Great shoes bargain at ABC store
1521,5.0,I loved this shopping street or should I say many streets. This place is easy to maneuver through and an easy walk from many hotels. A visit in the night is a must. The streets are alive with street stalls selling an amazing variety of food. There are so many cosmetic stalls and the prices and deals are certainly worth it. I visited this area in the day and the night and spent way too much money here. Definitely worth adding it to your itinerary if your want a shopping experience.
1522,5.0,Just love this street.  You have the best of everything!  From hotels to Street food to cafes and Korean restaurants!  You can get everything in there. All the prominent brands are there!  Amazing! You can't get enough of it.
1523,5.0,This is surely a must-see when in Seoul. The sights and sounds and the street food are just amazing. There are good restaurants as well if you prefer to eat in a more comfortable and relaxed setting. Make sure you're wearing good walking shoes!
1524,4.0,"korean version of Times Square! Shopping here is Really enjoyable. Got some good deals going on. Face shop had buy-1-free-1 for masks, the foreign brands were having some good deals going on too! Street food is yum. Restaurants and cafes are above on the 1st floor. The place is packed later when evening comes. Go in the morning for a more peaceful shopping experience."
1525,5.0,Plenty to see here... High street shops with local shops dotted within and market traders ... Fantastic atmosphere!
1526,5.0,Definitely suggested to visit in the eve. Shops are open till 10 PM at least - and you can have here your dinner from the street food cars.
1527,5.0,"There is no better place to shop till you drop. Great atmosphere, shops for miles and delicious street food to refuel. I recommend bringing an empty suitcase if you like cosmetics as there is no better place on earth."
1528,4.0,Kinda like mongkok with better quality things. 80pct filled with cosmetic shops...lots of hawker stalls selling interesting snacks at night.
1529,5.0,"A place where one gets whatever they want, from food to cosmetics. The trendiest place for fashion lovers, the most well-stocked shelves of cosmetics, huge variety of Korean food and themed cafes for dessert lovers."
1530,3.0,"it's a nice place to enjoy the street food - there's a good variety. I personally won't buy any stuff from the street shops as the prices are generally higher than those at the markets (like Dongdaemun). The place is chock full of cosmetic shops, probably the dream of all into skincare. You'll have plenty of sales girls trying to get you into their shops with free gifts."
1531,4.0,"Myeongdong is packed with both attire and cosmetic stores. You can see several Nature Republics, Skin Food, Etude. etc while walking around the area. Definitely the place to go to buy cosmetics. They also have a variety of street food from gyeran ppang (bread with a whole egg in it), fried potatoes, pomegranate juice, etc. There are variety of snacks you can pick from though I do realize that they are slightly more expensive as compared to other non-tourist areas in Seoul. As for food, you can never go hungry as you can pick from ddeokbukki, Japanese food to myeongdong kalguksu. There is also a cultural center which teaches how to make kimchi. The only thing is that for those who do not like any place packed with people this might not be your favorite spot. It is always packed with people all day long but it is worth a visit!"
1532,5.0,"One of the best spots for shopping and a must see if you're in Seoul. You can start in the early afternoon, and stay into the evening when the streets of Myeongdong transform into almost a carnival - street carts come out, merchandise is all over the place, music is blaring, food carts are steaming and the food is great! Shop for bargains, eat great food on sticks and with sticks, and simply have a good time! I do every time! Enjoy!"
1533,4.0,"love this place, actually they have many same shops in a same place. I kept seeing animal mask, it seems to be a trend now in korea. And also the very common cute socks...you can buy them for just 1000 won each. if you buy more about 10 you will get 1 free."
1534,5.0,It was amazing to spend some hours walking in the middle of thousant corean people and a lot of food street sellers. A lot of shops with loud music and nice items to buy. Great time specially for the week-end when the streets of this district ar crowded.
1535,4.0,"Located in the center of Seoul,near to Namsan, this is the place that will turn you into a sinful shopaholic. From trendy clothing brands to fancy accessories, to streets of famous beauty product shops to delicious street foods,you name it..its all here!..a great place to hangout and a lot of good cafes are here for you to visit. Lets shop till you drop!"
1536,4.0,"This place was bustling even though it was a cold, windy day. It is supposedly even more chaotic at night though we didn't experience it firsthand. We didn't know what kind of shopping to expect here, but it is more on the high-end and heavily populated by cosmetics stores. There's a lot of competition between cosmetics stores, so combing through the sales and shopping around will allow you to load up at decent prices. Each cosmetics store seems to have a barker out front. They also try to spice up the deals with freebies of all sorts when you purchase something. Now, they are trying to get your business, but they are nowhere near as aggressive as the Chinese in either mainland China or Hong Kong. So, don't feel pressured. If you buy a lot of cosmetics (and other eligible goods), you may be eligible for a tax refund. Myeongdong is one place that you can get the refund (also Incheon Airport). But, you have to fill out the forms they provide and have your passport. We didn't bother. It was too cold to walk further down the street to the building where you apply for the refunds. Myeongdong is not that big of a shopping area. You can probably walk the whole district in a couple of hours. There are numerous places to eat, so no problem there. If bargain clothing and cheap things are your thing, there are better places than Myeongdong for that in my opinion (Dongdaemun, for one). Myeongdong is a stop on the subway blue line."
1537,5.0,"there is a lot of food, shoes, clothes, and more food and snacks and food again! i love strawberry and in Myeong-Dong they got everything for real"
1538,2.0,"We visited Korea last year and this was the one area that I found the most disappointing. Every other shop tries to pull you in with varying languages and it really put us off going into any shop to browse because they won't leave you alone.  The products are also all the same, I don't think it's worth going into any of the generic facial product shops. The only ones possibly worthwhile (seriously) are the places that retail a particular brand (e.g. Laneige or A'Pieu). Don't bother with the generic tourist traps that sell a bulk of face masks they claim have gold leaf or snail extract. I remember alot of 'free' gifts used as bait. The shops that don't try hard and have lots of locals are the good ones.  Also, street food wise it was very mediocre. I probably have higher expectations though because of places in Taipei, KL, Beijing etc.  Personally its somewhere you will undoubtedly visit, but I wouldn't do my shopping in Myeongdong or expect much."
1539,4.0,Best time to go at night. More Street food. Also there alot of cosmetic shop. So many of the repeated shop so don't worry if you miss the first shop. Also if the shop is crowded or long queue at counter. They sometimes don't give many staples. So do take note.also the fruits there are expensive. I bought a box of strawberry at other neighbourhood for 5000won. Myeongdong sell at 14000won. What a rip-off.  I find the first stall ( near uniqlo)owned by and old woman that sell daebokki is nicer as the sauce is thicker.
1540,4.0,We had a great time walking around and collecting free face masks from shops. Lots of shopping and great food in the area.
1541,4.0,Overall great shopping experience - no issue in language as most shops offer sales assistant who speaks chinese - however some shops sales assistant were fairly pushy - keep pushing for bulk buying and if you are not buying in bulk they were quite reluctant to help further..
1542,4.0,"I stay at hotel in this area. This area getting crowded around 11.00-21.00. Mainly it is like shopping paradise for tourist and local. You can find many branded fashion, cosmetic, restaurant and street food that you must try. You can just take Metro Line 4 to Myeongdong Station and take exit 7 or 8, then you will find the crowd."
1543,5.0,This place is near our hotel and is fantastic if you want to experience Korean street foods and do make up shopping. I love how they close late at night (11 PM) so we often go here after our tours to relax and look at the shops. The brands that we saw here are usually Korean but there are also international bran stalls though we usually skip them. Tip: You can ask for product samples on make up stores. Some cashiers may not know that word though so you can search for the equivalent Korean word. You can also haggle with the stalls outside the shops.
1544,5.0,"Best place to go shopping for cosmetics but i do find that the stores are all pretty similar, selling similar stuff. Stores in this area are familiar with tourists so mostly they can speak english and they will give u tax refund form without you asking. Try to visit from 4PM onwards as the street food kiosks start in the afternoon"
1545,5.0,"Fun to stay here to try street foods, restaurants, shopping especially Korean cosmetics. Small Streets are for youth people especially fun in night time. Whenever I come to Seoul, I always save my time for this area."
1546,3.0,"You can't come here to be a budget shopper, but it is quite impressive given the fashion lead Korea is taking on the world stage."
1547,4.0,"This is a good shopping street. The Koreans are big on cosmetics, from what I've read before our trip, and there are surely several cosmetics stores on this street! But there are also souvenirs, restaurants, etc. worth a walk through for sure."
1548,5.0,"Amazing shopping - would definitely recommend for beauty addicts!! Bit intimidating at first but once you get over that it's amazing - don't forget to bargain, although can be tricky as not everyone speaks English."
1549,5.0,"Basically, everything you would want to find/buy in Seoul will be here. Wide range of cosmetic brands (popular ones like Etude, Nature Republic, Innisfree have several branches in this area so you can spot one almost at every turn). Some items may be selling at slightly cheaper prices in other markets (if that matters); otherwise for convenience, shop till you drop! Do try out the street food and drop by O'Sulloc for some good tangerine/green tea latte."
1550,2.0,"On a very cold rainy day, there were a lot of tourists and locals in the area. Staff at the shops shout to get your attention. Lots of choices to go for shopping, cute stuff to buy."
1551,4.0,You can hear pretty much every language but mainly Japanese and Chinese. I thought I was in China rather than Korea. It is a great place to experience street food.
1552,5.0,"I went with a local so it was easy to jump from one shop to another. I bought at Hollika Hollika (very persuasive saleswomen and premium priced), Nature Republic. Try strawberry coated with some jelly and blackbean paste."
1553,4.0,The market comes alive after dusk when hawkers start setting up their stalls. You can have a variety of local Korean food and do your shopping as well. We found it to be a very safe place and you can even approach tourist officials who are in red vests for directions or help. It is a must visit place if you love shopping.
1554,4.0,The weather was miserable the day we went to the shopping street. It was cold and rainy and it was not fun walking around in it. There are a lot of stores and at all price ranges too.
1555,5.0,"This place has a great vibe! Lots of food vendors, crazy amount of cosmetic shops all over the places, Even the shop sales person will give freebies to the street walkers, most of the shops pretty much had a great sale and best part is generous amount of samples you get at the time of your purchase:~)) . Via subway get down at Eljira-1ga station to get here."
1556,5.0,"I purposely went to book a hotel that is very near this place. Myeongdong is a bustling place with shops open till late at night. The cosmetic shops are right beside each other. There are multiple shops of each brand. There are nice cafes and awesome shops to buy clothes, shoes and of course, cosmetics. Sales people are outside inviting crowds in and handing out free mask sheets. When you go inside to buy, they will dump even more freebies in your bag. They are also very honest because I went there and the cashier forgot to put an item. I went back and they gave it to me. No hassle. I spent a lot on Korean cosmetics which is very good for the skin. On the streets are all kinds of street food from seafood to noodles to ice cream. Every night we were in Seoul I was there. I even went in the morning. But I recommend going there in the evening."
1557,2.0,"Do not buy stuffs from the street vendors. Their items are marked up at least 3 times higher than the same item in other places. We were quoted 30000won for a bag pack. The same bag pack costs only 10000 won at express bus terminal, ewha uni, gangnam. Same goes to the street food and cosmetic."
1558,5.0,This is a street for food lovers and you can found few cute things and there is music performance with some kitchen stuff.
1559,4.0,Good for shopping but very crowded as I went on Christmas eve but it's a good place to hang out and try street food
1560,4.0,"You can find almost everything here from facial products to clothings, accessories, foods and cafe they have everything here was here on a weekend and the crowd was crazy."
1561,3.0,"Is the place to go to buy as they have a lot of tourist discount but also due to that there is a lot I mean A LOT of China people and as they flock in all the samples are not ""free"" anymore as you need to buy something before they give you any samples. The street food is a little overprice but it tourist spot so naturally the prices are higher."
1562,4.0,"A gazillion beauty shops and if you're looking to buy some facial products, this will be your best bet. Though street food are available here, I very much enjoyed those found in Insadong or Dongdaemun more."
1563,3.0,"I'm not quite sure about the attraction of Myeongdong. Food? There are a few good restaurants but nothing that really stands out. Shopping? There are a few good stores, but nothing that I can't get anywhere else in Korea. When I first came to Korea 5 years ago, Myeongdong had a larger variety of stores and restaurants. It was a place you could go on a date, watch a movie, walk around, do some shopping or chat at a cafe. Now it is an over crowded tourist trap. The big cosmetic stores really killed the joy of this place. It seems like all the stores sell the same thing, and it is the same cosmetic stores in every direction, which you can get almost anywhere in Seoul. And the worst part is this shopping street is very crowded. If you do have to cross this off your list of places to visit, then the are a few things that I would recommend, Myeongdong Kalguksu restaurant, the Catholic Cathedral and Ouga Korean BBQ restaurant."
1564,5.0,"This is indeed a shopping heaven.. Especially for ladies.. Beauty products are really cheap there and definitely a ""must buy""! Will definitely visit again."
1565,5.0,Went down to Myeondong shopping street for 2 night as last minute I need to get something from there This shopping street is very accessible by subway and is always packed with both local Koreans and tourists Enjoyed the street food and the ambience specially like to walk in the street during cold winter period There is a MCM flagship store in the area and would be great for people who like to get MCM stuff and they also offered tax refund Recommeded to visit during the night where most of the stores are opended and crowded with people  Dr E. Chow
1566,4.0,"Myeondong is very crowded most of the time. Esp on public holidays and weekends. Lots of interesting street food, cosmetics shop. A must go for travellers visiting Seoul"
1567,1.0,If you're from Europe of the USA there is very little here to interest you. Clothes will all be too small for adults and there is an over abundance of junk clothes and makeup stores. At the other end of the scale you have very expensive Korean department stores such as Lotte and Hyundai. If you really must visit try and get in and out early before the mass hordes of younger Asian tourists arrive.
1568,4.0,It's a shopping area with tourist attraction around. Is a nice location to get a hotel here too. A lot of restaurants are here and also those Korea cosmetic brand. The Nanta theater is also located in the middle of Myeongdong. Staffs in those shops are helpful however some of them may be rude also.
1569,4.0,Don't miss this place for ultimate local shopping and street food. The crowd was incredible and yet you can still get good bargains and trendy stuff!!
1570,4.0,"A great area to visit for street food, cosmetic shopping as well as big/ little shops with clothing, souvenirs, handbags & many other things. I would recommend the ""Nanta"" show. Also check out many little kiosks at the subway station underground. The restaurants were great. Eating street food was an experience but the ones we tasted was just ok. Did love the Rose shaped ice cream--that was yummy!"
1571,4.0,Myeongdong known for Shopping heaven for women. You can get lots of korean trendy cosmetics and fashion in that area. Easy communicate with the staff in store.  Lots of restaurant and cafe. suitable for both friends & family.
1572,5.0,"Myeongdong - Shopping paradise. Best Night Market, you'll be spoil for choices. Especially for the ladies - Make-up, skincare products, shoes, clothes, bags..to name a few. Rows of vendor with their kiosk selling all sorts of goodies. There's also a Halal kiosk selling Dragon-beard Candies & Kebabs. We simply love it!!"
1573,5.0,"As the title implies, Myeongdong is known for shopping and eating. You'll find the same cosmetics stores on every corner, multiple times. There is a second floor cafe called Poem that has good tea and patbingsu. Telling you that it's on the street with a cosmetic store on the corner is totally unhelpful. If you can find Poem, go in for the tea or coffee (which comes with a slice of cake with each drink) and patbingsu."
1574,3.0,"Myeongdong is always busy with tourists and this destination is always included in the itinerary of tour groups. Personally, I would avoid this place as I prefer shopping and dining elsewhere as everything here is expensive. However, you must visit this place at least once just to experience the atmosphere.  I brought my sister and brother-in-law to this place as this was their 1st trip to Seoul. Unfortunately, they did not like this place as it was very crowded and they are not big fans of shopping. Nevertheless, we soaked in the atmosphere and left after seeing some beautiful Christmas lightings."
1575,4.0,"If you like shopping, this is a good place to visit. Many shops, restaurants, especially cosmetics shops are round every corner. We visited on a weekday and went back on the weekend. It was so happening on the Saturday we went, many food vendors and activities ongoing. Great atmosphere."
1576,4.0,We stayed very near to Myeongdong. We will shop every night.Not all stalls sell items that are cheap so do look around first before you want to get. Some stalls sells reasonable earrings / socks 1000 won for 1 pair -$1.24 10000won for 1 bag-$12 plus The bags are very pretty. I bought 2 for myself and 5 for my loved ones. Go to this restaurant called Sinseon Seolnongtang beside Bee Cheng Hiang at Myeongdong. The beef soup and kimchi is good. You can buy the kimchi back for your Loved ones. Enjoy yourselves when you are there especially the weather over there is cold now.
1577,3.0,"many kinds of foods street and souvenirs and distro for any product of cosmetics, fashion, theatre and cullinary of traditional korean dishes. near from myeongdong subway station. we can walk with fun to enjoy the ambience. dont go to this place on winter seasson. rain and cold is not good for your condition. in the midle of alley, we can see Unesco building with good show act. get more time on here..enjoy"
1578,5.0,"You must must come here. ..The shops are filled with skincare goodness and it's hard to resist. Do not worry about the tax refund process, they've simplified it a lot and you only queue once at tax refund and after checking in, once to get your cash. So go ahead, shop til you drop. The egg bread here is 2000 won, other places like Ewha is only 1000won. So get your egg bread fix at Ewha instead."
1579,4.0,"We went there lastweek it was fun. They sell many interesting street food,cheap bag and etc. right in the center of the road. Go there at night time they sell more stuff and it looks pretty bec of the lights!"
1580,5.0,this is where you get all the street food and street shopping at its best... Lots of restaurants and dessert places. There are many streets there and usually very crowded! One place it is a must try... Korean Dessert Shop. Shaved ice dessert... very very good.
1581,4.0,We have bought many things here and we have tried different kinds of street foods during the evening. Yummy.
1582,2.0,"The shopping malls are the same wherever you go - same brands, same exhorbitant prices. Very little local or unique stuff. Full of Chinese tourists with an enormous appetite to devour everything esp cosmetics"
1583,5.0,"This is famous for shopping.  But actually it was origin of Private Finance. And cultural area. After that we have many cosmetic shops.  Restaurants are naturally became popular here. We have all different types of restaurants.  Good place for shopping, eating, show, movie.  :)"
1584,4.0,"Lotsssss of skincare & cosmetics boutiques here. And the prices are very cheap! You can get lots of sample from every purchase and sometimes, samples are given even by just entering the store. Various street foods, restaurant and cafe can be found here and Myeongdong is very alive at night."
1585,5.0,"Definitely Hyper! Esp on Saturday night. Mostly make up stores though - street food here is great! Steak, chicken bbq, squid, crepes, fresh juices, baby crispy crabs etc etc! This is where our hotel is located, great location for tourists intending to do some major shopping! :-)"
1586,5.0,"Where can you get a Hello kitty on your latte, Ray a rose shaped gelato, see a top rated show, hear KPOP music, see smurfs walking around, shop, get street character socks for less than a dollar, try a Sulbing shave ice, and eat great street food 9 am to midnight? In Myeongdong! This is such an exciting part of Seoul to explore. Take the subway to Myeongdong station. You can't drive on the alleys on Myeongdong , you just get out and explore on foot about to+ square blocks. It's always crowded, so if you are expecting that, it's ok."
1587,4.0,"Being in Seoul for the first time and living in Singapore all my life, I wasn't that keen to spend a day shopping in urban city, but! I changed my mind after landing my feet in Myeongdong at ard 3pm and couldn't get enough of it and left by 10pm! Colorful, lively, bustling and packed, interesting night market and the cool weather made it perfect to explore, stop, take photos, eat, drink & shop."
1588,4.0,"Awesome shopping paradise for girls and momsies and be totally spoilt for choice of facial masks, specifically those must-have Snail masks and other skincare products. Shops like Etude House, Innisfree, Nature Republic, The Face Shop, Laneige, you name it. Clothes and fashion wear too but they were mostly of winter wear at the moment."
1589,4.0,"If you look for cosmetics, foods, then you must go this place!.. Buying cosmetics here, can easily get free samples! wow..."
1590,3.0,I used to shop here pretty often a few years back; now it's a tourist-central area where the shop employees are pretty much required to speak in other languages to pull in foreign customers. I've had multiple instances where the employees approached me in Chinese or Japanese to try to sell me products (I'm Korean). I would recommend this place for tourists who want to do some shopping in Korea- it's THE place to shop in Korea.
1591,4.0,"This is a true shopping haven for Korean cosmetics and for clothes in general, if shopping is your thing. It's very easy to go around. There are multi lingual guides you can talk to and they give out free maps of the area as well as of Seoul! The prices of the cosmetics is almost half what they are in my country so buying them here is a no-brainer. It does get a bit too busy so if you don't like crowds you might want to go when there are less tourists - a little before noon and after 7pm perhaps."
1592,5.0,"As we spent two days there, it was so difficult for us to walk from one block to another. There are too many good things to shop for, including fancy air cushion powder as basic foundation and facial care products. We got lots of trial free samples as masks or sample size lotions. Gosh~ We really had a great time there. And there are even tourist center people wearing red clothes to answer your questions regarding to currency exchange or restaurant recommendation or tax refund."
1593,5.0,"Enjoy the Korean style street markets every day, you can have authentic food , negotiate the prices, watch activities of performances and get your souvenirs. Remember the time, 5pm, be there or be square."
1594,4.0,"You can most of the skin care & cosmetic over here. Most of the shops are giving free sample at the entrance by putting it in a shopping basket n hand it over to you. They will force you to enter the shop and if you do not purchase anything, they will take back the shopping basket whereby the free sample is still inside it. Noticed that a lot of the staff were from China instead of Korea. Communication could be difficult as they could hardly speak in English."
1595,4.0,"We came here because my missus wanted to look at all the make up and stuff, as this area is famous for that.  So I just walked around and looked at the various street stalls and street food on offer. I think typically it is quite same to eat the street food, but maybe you should be a bit weary of the squids and such because I had some and ended up with a pretty dodgy stomach.  Apart from that, the rest of the stuff seemed fine, alot of the chicken skewers and noodles and such is quite tasty and pretty safe to eat.  The area is a bit of a maze, and have essentially the same stuff as everywhere else, but it seems to give you more discounts and what not, so I suppose thats why people come here to shop.  Didn't care for the shopping, but as a guy, there is probably still enough going on to keep me occupied for a few hours."
1596,4.0,"Most stores give samples and freebies when you buy there (there were two that did not give us anything but we had huge discounts of like 50% so that's fine). Other places may offer some samples and freebies but nothing beats cosmetics/skincare shopping at Myeongdong. The shopping is awesome & there are lots of street food stalls, although it's more expensive than other places, possibly due to the large number of tourists in the area. There are money changers near the China Embassy if you need more money and Lotte is just opposite the street if you want to buy high end stuff. Must go even if you're not buying stuff - you can just eat there too, plenty of food options!"
1597,5.0,"If you plan to shop in Korea, do it in one of the night markets and Myeongdong is one of those fascinating places. Many brands for make up may already be locally available but prices here are a real steal! And don't forget to try street food. Not all Korean food have kimchi in it. There's a lot of sweets too, freshly made in front of you. Great place to be and I feel safe here too!"
1598,5.0,"I loved this place especially in evening, during evening hours this place is bustling with street vendors, street food, tourist. It’s absolutely lively and interesting to visit for shopping right from Korean crafted jewelry boxes to foot wear, from magnets to key rings and on and on… Since we were staying in Myeongdong we visited almost every evening just to get the feel of the place. A must visit attraction."
1599,4.0,"Shopping experience for anyone at all budget level, wear comfortable walking shoes & come prepared to explore what's above ground, inside malls & underground connecting to the train stations - and the crowds. We got tired mid-afternoon & stop at one of many indoor basement's food court's cafe for a break, directly under one of the major department stores ... great on a rainy day & stay dry, going from building to building. Street food vendors were getting ready for the evening & night market but many have been out all day selling items of interest to tourists & visitor, locals alike. Bargain hunters beware, prices aren't necessary inexpensive here in Seoul as standards of living are rather high and we're surprised how costly fresh fruits are sold on street corners & inside fancy supermarkets, wow - sticker shocks, it's ""cheaper"" at home in the USA. Come here in a group with friends, pick a meeting spot & time and go explore on your own for a few hours - you will need lots of time to walk around & experience it."
1600,5.0,"I love Myeongdong very very much! This is a good place for shopping and lots of restaurants too! Very hipped place where you can find the latest fashion here. Lots of street food too, yummy. You can shop til you drop :P Bus ticket can be bought from the airport and stops right here. I always stay at King Sejong whenever I visit Seoul and Myeongdong is just next door. The subway is just around the corner too, very convenient."
1601,3.0,"Visited a couple of times during a 5 day trip to Seoul and since I've gotten into Korean beauty products, Myeongdong was on my must-list. The place itself is insanely packed with both tourists and locals. Most of the stores are repeats (ie multiple Etude House, Missha, Nature Republic, Innisfree, Tony Molly) but I can't tell if they are independently run because your experience varies but the products and prices are the same. There are a few that were not as ""mass"" such as Shara Shara and Mediheal (both of these stores' staff I found were nice and helpful!). If you go, bring lots of patience and get used to the idea of being followed/hounded by sales people (can't be quite claustrophobic to westerners used to ""personal space"") and trying to sell you packages of facial sheet masks in the dozens (I was looking for personal use not for re-sale). Most of the staff are nice and really just want to help (most don't speak English though). The exception seems to have been the massive Nature Republic near Uniqlo by the main entrance. Not only did the sales lady follow me around but apparently I was too slow to decide to buy anything so she took my basket away and basically pushed me out (oh and the ""free"" gift in the basket that they push on to you as you enter because apparently it's only for buyers. I wouldn't have been so peeved if I hadn't bought many other products from the same store the day before.  If you go, go for the experience (the street food was good too) but be warned. Except for a few relatively 'unique' stores that's harder to find elsewhere like Shara Shara, all the other stores can be found everywhere else in Seoul where it's less crowded. I'd probably skip next time. Like another reviewer said, Lotte Department store in Myeongdong may be a better option (the duty free shop is even crazier though!) where you'll find the higher end beauty products that's hard to find outside Korea."
1602,5.0,"This is the place to shop in Seoul - where the locals go! Unlike in Gangnam, prices here are reasonable and if you know how to bargain its a plus."
1603,4.0,I always come here when i need to buy my skincare products and cosmetics. They have all the brands here plus there are a couple of good restaurants here. My favourite being the SamGyeTang restaurant (it's a little hard to locate since there are so many different lanes that lead to different streets...) The downside is that this place is super touristy and always packed with people...so be mentally prepared if you are heading down to Myeongdong.
1604,2.0,"Touted as the best of the shopping districts in Seoul, was really a bit of a letdown...it was just a mindless repetition of shops selling the same make up items interspersed with a few shops selling mobile accessories...prices n items are literally similar in all shops, so it's gets boring quite quickly ..what's worse is Korean dealers are the worst in terms of bargaining...they don't ever reduce prices which is weird for a"
1605,5.0,"This is a shoppers dream, everything you need - from clothes, shoes bags and specially cosmetics... You can also find interesting food carts around the area and it is a must that you try one of this street foods. You can shop until the wee hours of the morning and the choices are endless."
1606,5.0,"Friends and work colleagues recommended me to stay in Myeongdong as this was my first visit to Seoul, Korea. They told me I will never regret it. So I booked a great hotel Skypark III hotel and I couldn't believe it was a great bargain! Reasonably priced, situated in the middle of Myeongdong district. Right in front of the hotel is the Myeongdong underground train station. Behind the hotel is a big maze of fabulous shops and eating outlets. I was always out and about going to touristy places since the underground train was just downstairs. In the evening I spent most of my time looking and buying stuffs from those lovely Myeongdong shops and also had tasty Korean and Japanese dinners from those eating outlets. I truly loved my 6 night stay in fabulous Myeongdong area. Superbly convenient!"
1607,4.0,"Here you can find anything and everything you need. Bags, cosmetic, clothes, accessories, shoes, food, etc.. Remember to bring a big bag to put all your purchases, if not you will be holding dozen of bags in your hands and it is very heavy (speak from experience). You can always go to any restaurants or cafes to rest before continuing the shopping spree. Wear comfortable shoes as you will be shopping non-stop! There are many brands of cosmetic or facial products, look out for their sales! You won't want to miss this place when you are in Seoul~"
1608,5.0,Oh boy shop till you drop well my feet were sore by the end of the day. Bags food clothes shoes army gear phone covers just go and immerse yourself at this huge market day and night . I bought about 4 handbags jewellery t shirts and we eat the yummy food and drank at the cafes
1609,3.0,"After dinner at InSadong and it was 10pm but all the shops and cafes were shutting. We felt it was too early to go ""home"", my Korean friend has suggested Myeongdong. It was still hustle and bustle with many street vendors selling stuff, the stores and all the eateries were still opened - yes! We have come to the right place to round up the evening."
1610,5.0,"I spent so much time talking around the markets and although they sell cosmetic products all day long, its fun to walk around even if you are bored! its pretty much open all day long but the street foods really come out in the afternoon when its cooler and its totally buzzing at night!"
1611,5.0,"So many beauty and facial shop in here...i was kinda lost as i saw sooooo many same shop in this are such nature republic, tony moly, skin food and etc. They said you can get a lot's of free sample from the shop but from what i experience was, they will ""pull"" you into their shop and ""opps"" your money fly away~~ food from the stall was nice, souvenir are quite expensive."
1612,5.0,"Must go for quintessential korea tourist experience. Place to go for, beauty products, one of a kind socks and all the big brand stores."
1613,5.0,It's a heaven for shopaholic! You can shop tons of make up and skin product as well as clothes and accessories
1614,5.0,"Loads of shops, cafes and restaurants. Travel light with a half empty suitcase to Seoul, hit Myeongdong and fill that suitcase! Just in case you run out of space, you can always buy a extra suitcase at Myeongdong."
1615,5.0,"Pros: Live atmosphere at night: there are street performers and sometimes guerilla concerts.  More shops than you would expect: From old ladies selling socks to souvenir shops and department stores. I would consider this place to be the mecca of fashion.  Food: Lots of street vendors and many restaurants  Cons: Too crowded: certain days and certain times, it can be very hectic. The feeling is like Time Square,NYC."
1616,4.0,"Wow, have never seen so many shops all together where they sell all kind of cosmetics and beauty products. After all shopping we were beautified with the promise to get 20 years younger......"
1617,5.0,Awesome place with so many different facial products to choose from at a reasonable cheap price. Definitely a must in Seoul.
1618,4.0,"Shoppers paradise. Super crowded but fun too. Felt like osaka japan's shopping scene with more better prices. Regardless of time, this place is full of energy"
1619,4.0,"We were in South Korea for 13 days. For the first 9 days, we traveled all the way along the east coast of South Korea visiting attractions in Namiseon Island, Seoraksan, Donghae, Gyeongju, all the way down to Busan and from Busan fly via Jejuair to Jeju. When we returned to Seoul after 3 nights in Jeju, we decided to explore Seoul on our own using the subway. It was very easy just like taking the MRT in Singapore. Beside visiting the ancient palaces, our aunties could not resist the temptation of frequenting all the shopping paradises in Seoul. And the one right on top of our list was Myeongdong, the `Orchard Road' in South Korea where you find latest cosmetic products at 30 to 40% cheaper than those in Singapore.  Most of the aunties in my group are all obsessed with watching Korean dramas. The actresses are so young and beautiful and their skin rejuvenation secrets lies in plastic surgery and the cosmetic products they used. In fact, those aunties who did not purchase were also eager to collect the many free samples of skin products distributed at the front of the shops. There were many branches of cosmetic shops including Nature Republic, Lotte, Etude House, SkinCare, etc and you apparently see them everywhere.  I don't fancy these ladies' products and instead walked around looking at the many makeshift stalls selling Korean delicacies. It was fun seeing the many creative way of selling food in this shopping belt. I was also surprised to see how evangelism was done in a creative way with gospel teachings written on banners and posters strapped on the body of the evangelist while he roamed around the shopping area as if he was carrying the `cross' on his back.  I also noticed a banner with Chinese wordings hoisted around the shopping area to attract China tourists. Apparently with the influx of Chinese tourists into Korea, the retail businesses in Myeongdong were enjoying good times.  Myeondong is modern and lustrous like the Orchard Road in Singapore as compared with Dongdamuen and Namdaemun. It is the shopping paradise of all our young ladies and aunties attracting them with all the skin products and cosmetics."
1620,4.0,"Busy as... well it's really busy. Be prepared for tourists, Koreans, and touts. You'll find excellent street food (especially in the evenings), tons of restaurants, clothes and cosmetics galore!"
1621,2.0,"This shopping district is great for cosmetics and women's fashion, but better if you plan ahead. Do some research and find out which Korean cosmetic brands have the best reputation. One street is full of cosmetic shops - some cool, some boring. Choose carefully. Some of the prices are higher than in England, Australia or other Asian countries. You will not get a bargain if you buy just 1 or 2 things.  Girls, leave your boyfriend behind. This is torture for men. All the streets look the same, it's a crazy labyrinth and it's hard to find a cafe where you can sit down. It's also very hard to find an English ATM. If you have small kids, don't bring them here. The cobbled streets will break any stroller and the crowds will bump into your kids."
1622,5.0,"My most favorite shops here are the cosmetics! They were really so cheap (compared in my country). I went crazy here and I swear that I will go back!  The place is crowded but you won't mind it because you will go crazy shopping (if you enjoy shopping). If not, you could try different snacks in the middle. All are must try! :)"
1623,4.0,"Very lively, but super crowded. Very popular with young Koreans, and also Chinese and Japanese tourists. Tip: If you just want to shop, come before noon on a weekend morning. For the first hour or two that shops are open, few people are around."
1624,3.0,"Too crowded, and to me, it is like a China place, staff and visitors all speak Chinese, lack of local Korean charisma"
1625,4.0,"50% of the items are facial shops, repeating sale of the same items. Food items are also mediocre in standard and really expensive. Good to go for just a sense of the place, famous Jimdak noodles as well as dumpling stall. Also be prepared to be shoved by locals and foreign travelers."
1626,5.0,"Yes. You come here to shop. Then eat. Then shop some more. I would say go here after going to N Seoul Tower. I made a mistake of going here first, shop then go to N. Seoul Tower. I was way too tired for the walk.  Just keep in mind that most of the souvenirs here can be found somewhere else (like Hongdae and Insadong) at a cheaper price."
1627,5.0,"We went at night and their were so many people shopping, enjoying eating street food. I just love it here! Too many shops to check and buy many stuff on the street. I will go back to this night market ,its so fun to taste all the different korean street food. Great night market! a must visit!"
1628,5.0,"Whenever im in Seoul, this is the only place that I would have on top of my list for shopping and food!!"
1629,4.0,This place is very busy and interesting - good people watching and window shopping. There was also a lot of fun street food. It is a really nice place to walk around if you're out late.
1630,5.0,"Myeongdong is known for shopping, and its wide range of restaurants. You will find everything you want over there whether its in the streets or in small local shops. It's very busy yet its amazing. I love how every corner of the street has tiny shops. Whether you go left or right you'll find shops. In addition, the shops close late at night so you don't have to hurry and just take your time."
1631,5.0,"Plenty of shops (mostly cosmetics and fashion) and restaurants. You have lots and lots of choices.  This place doesn't seem to sleep.  Take your time to compare products, buy a piece of two and try before buying the actual."
1632,3.0,"Like most things in Korea, this is overrated. Seriously. It's a few streets with vendors and whatnot, but it's certainly not a must see. Koreans hype it up, as they do with most things Korean, but in no way will you find Myeongdong as interesting as they do."
1633,5.0,"This place is a must if you are in Seoul. The place is packed with shops and restaurants. You can chill the whole day there. Many restaurants from street food, fast food to nice dinning.  Overall, great place and must visit if you are in Seoul."
1634,5.0,This area is a series of pedestrian streets jammed full of shops and restaurants but most of all a woman's delight with tons of cosmetic shops. My wife was in heaven but my wallet was not.
1635,4.0,"Always crowded but loads stuffs to shop. This place is a must visit place for tourists . Restaurants, coffee shops and shopping stuffs are in abundance here.. I like the vibe of this place"
1636,5.0,"Awesome shopping ! Love Socks visit here. Great place to visit, Enjoy Korea! An all around great place to visit. Make sure you visit the SeoulSocks shop its really great shop."
1637,4.0,"This is the place you want to go for shopping! Especially for cosmetics! There are cosmetic stores every five meters and there are people on the street trying to get you in by giving you a handful of free testers. The cosmetics in Korea are very cheap compared to Europe and the quality is outstanding, don't be afraid to try some crazy things like snail masks etc either, those are the good stuff for real. Remember to ask for samples when you are paying, they will give you another handful of samples for free and you might turn up finding real gems. Lots of food joints, clothing stores and high end stores in this are as well. Don't bother shopping anywhere else, you got it all in here.  TIP: at the metro stations you can rent a locker for a small price, if you are planning for a shopping spree like we did you might want to rent a locker and when it just gets too heavy to carry, bring them in the locker and continue. Be aware tho that the problem of carrying those heavy bags still waits you after the haul. ;)"
1638,5.0,Our hotel was in Myeongdong and every night we went shopping and food tripping there. We were lucky that night market starts early. Got some nice stuffs for reasonable prices.
1639,5.0,"I was walking around with a shopping list given by my mum. She has listed the price of each item which can be bought online for a certain price. My job of course was to find the item and get it at a lower price.  So from this I learnt that most sales staff can give you 20% discount even though there is no other promotion. Just ask for it and be firm, otherwise walk away because there are probably 4 of the same shop in the area."
1640,5.0,This place is so busy with cosmetic and skin care shops. Be prepared to walk down the street and have face masks and fans offered to you but once you take one they will usher you into their store to sell you something. It's ok to have a look around but don't feel pressured to buy something because they can be full on. Some shop keepers are a little pushy while others will give you space. Some will follow you and as soon as your eyes have stopped on a product for more than 5 seconds they will try to sell it to you. Most are very helpful.
1641,3.0,"Like: how easy to come here and how many types of food, clothes, headwear to facial stuffs you can get here. Most of the beauty shops here do sales and willingly give a lot a lot of freebies, the more you buy, the more freebies you'll get  Dislike: Beware of people pushing around. Street food too very over price for a stick of potato cost 3USD, better go for a meal in nearby restaurant. Too much of shops that are the same. Too repetitive"
1642,3.0,"Unless you are really into shopping, I don't find this place is interesting. Insa-song is much more interesting in my opinion. If you don't have a lot of time in Seoul, you can skip Myeongdong."
1643,4.0,"Life in Korea is totally different. Shopping is a must when coming to these part of town. I believe that tourist even from China and Japan spend their time in these areas.  After reviewing this place, I figure out that there was a duty free zone which enlighten the minds of shoppers for a cheaper bargain. So why not shop till you drop to get the best goods in town."
1644,5.0,"So much going on and to see. Evening time the street food stalls come out so you can try all the local treats for 1000-3000won. So many beauty shops selling makeup and cosmetics- they entice you with freebies then expect you to come into the shop and look around. You don't have to buy anything which is good, so get your freebie, look around and then leave!"
1645,4.0,"Plenty of shops all over the place, all the Korean cosmetic brands can be found here and they always give you samples when you buy or if you enter the shop. After a while, you see many duplicates of the same brands. There is plenty of street food to buy along the way and many nice restaurants or cafes to eat and rest your legs. One can find everything here!"
1646,4.0,"Although there is alot of shops around this area, most of them are duplicate. Within a short distance you will see the same shop especially cosmetics. They will have staff outside the shop holding the masks trying to entice you. However, don't be mistaken. It's not free.  The atmosphere here is what attract tourists. Definitely still a place to visit when in Seoul."
1647,3.0,"Surprisingly for such a busy well known tourist attraction, the stores around here for shopping close at around 10pm. There's so much people in each store and in every cosmetic store everything is mainly sold to cater to the many Chinese tourist that come to visit the city, which only buy in bulk and nothing else. I personally do not like the foreign crowd this area attracts and find it too busy to enjoy the shopping. I would definitely recommend going to the less busy areas to meet your shopping needs as most Korean cosmetic brands can be found everywhere. They do tend to hand out more samples while walking the streets but tend to find that they hesitate on whom they give it to. Worth checking out but not the best for finding deals and bargains unless you love to fight the crowds!"
1648,4.0,"Please do your homework before coming here. Download all the related discount coupon. I downloaded discount coupon from visit korea website as well as a Japanese website (I read a little Japanese).  Some salespersons can speak English. The saleslady from Laneige left me with the deepest impression. She speaks good English, she is very friendly and helpful.  Happy shopping there"
1649,2.0,"Shops, restaurants, shops, restaurants. Nothing else. Nothing to do if you don't want to spend your money. Other shopping places are more interesting."
1650,5.0,"If you do not live in the area, it is worth 2 days there to complete the shopping. If you buy enough, like more than 100 US, the shops will provide you with tax return vouchers. The street food is very tasty, and clean."
1651,4.0,"Easily the must do for the shoppaholics like myself and partner. Spent hours purchasing cosmetics and eating street food. The area is always bustling with people, shops open slightly later and there is a good mix of brands and local designs.  Some of the better exchange rates are available here as well if you're looking to get some Korean won."
1652,4.0,"Looking for skincare & make-up? Myeongdong has it all! Make sure you are on ur best pair of walking shoes, cause there is plenty to see, eat and shop! If you travel to Seoul and nvr visited Myeongdong, you did not really experience Seoul. If you want to hunt for cheap buy? Suggest to check out Lotte Department Store, lvl 9 -11 are the duty free shops, which prices are much cheaper compared to shop lots outside. But be prepare to Q, tourist groups kinda pack the place."
1653,4.0,"Food and shopping,everything in walking distance. However, goods are comparable expensive at this area."
1654,5.0,"If you are the type of person that likes busy hectic places then Myeongdong is for you. It's usually quiet in the morning but the whole place livens up around mid afternoon and peaks at night.  You will find all sorts of clothing outlets including local and foreign, plenty of cosmetic stores and authentic Korean restaurants for food lovers. If you're more of the adventurous type then why not try the street food? There's plenty to choose from.  Be Warned those of you not from the bigger cities might find the place intimidating at first. But stick around and you'll find plenty to do and see."
1655,3.0,I don't really like the crowds. Some people might love it but not for me.. I enjoyed shopping at Insadong and Dongdaemun more.
1656,5.0,"Myeondong district lives up to the hype as one of the best shopping districts in Seoul. It was streets upon streets of local and foreign stores. Most of the salesmen know how to speak english or to deal with foreigners.  Make sure to plan ahead about where to go. We only had 5 hours to go around so we had to research for the stores we wanted to go to. It helped but in general 5 hours isn't enough to explore all of Myeongdong. Wear comfortable shoes. Stores I liked were Top 10, Beanpole, Uniqlo, Artshop, and H&M. Other stores at the side sold cheaper goods. I liked buying the socks with different patterns as souvenirs for 1000 won each."
1657,3.0,This market looks like Chinese market. You get lot of Made in Korea stuff but I am almost sure they are China make. Especially I experienced while buying bags you could negotiate as low as 50% of the price towards the end of working day like after 6pm.  I did not find anything authentic Korean but its a treat to see authentic Korean Street food stalls.
1658,4.0,This place has great shops and everything opens until fairly late - I think some stores were opened until 11pm. There's also plenty of street food where you can enjoying eating while shopping!
1659,5.0,It's the Korean cosmetic heavy and you do shop till you drop. Every few steps you can see the same shops over n over again. Cheap masks n Chinese speaker workers. Must go for girls!
1660,4.0,"There's so much to explore. There's something exciting in every single corner. Street food, Fashion, Cosmetics, Cats coffee - you name it, Myeongdong has it. The only down side is probably how crowded it always is... And how all those pretty clothes are not size4andabove friendly :) Other than that? Amazing"
1661,5.0,"It's super crowded all the time in Myeongdong, but it's fun to see the workers outside all of the makeup shops trying to get you to go in. There's lots of street food to try. There's also a movie theater above the Uniqlo store."
1662,5.0,"There are a lot of restaurants but this place is really for women. Lots of Korean beauty products, cafes, restaurants and tons of street food. Must go to the Hello Kitty cafe and have a cake and latte."
1663,4.0,"The street is very crowded with tourist and shoppers but that was fun! Be adventurous in trying Korean's street food. My goodness, they are delicious! Dakkochi and Egg Bread are my top favorite. Tteokbokki is a killer to me, it's too spicy but when I eat Tteokbokki with Dakkochi, it's a match! Yummy!"
1664,4.0,"For shopping, trying exotic new street food, this is the place you have to go. You can easily kill 6 hours walking around eating experiencing all of it. It is also really close to City Hall, Namdemun market,  Just remember to go to a coffee shop or restaurant to get some energy so you can keep going!"
1665,5.0,"This place has it all. Clothes, shoes, cosmetics, more cosmetics, knick knacks. There are restaurants and street food after about 6pm. Love the local street food like fried glass noodles and korean noodles. Just can't have enough of this. Greeeeeat shopping experience. If you ran out of money, the exchange by the Chinese Embassy (behind Korea Post Tower) has the BEST exchange rates. Thoroughly enjoyed myself."
1666,4.0,The place to go if you're a shopaholic! A few big malls within each other with Doota! being the best for fashions. Opens til wee morning!
1667,5.0,"Check in hotel to see other guests checking in & checkin out with huge luggages. After settling in the hotel, we went out & understand why those huge luggages. Its mask shops, trendy shops, shoes, food, H & M, Zara, Forever 21, SPAO, Topten 10. Every ally & every corners, you can find face mask shops packed in 10s or 20s. At nite its even more lively, when the food stores are out. Mostly fixed at WON3000, you can try all kind of food from strawberry coated with syrup, freshly squeezed orange, sausages, bun with fried egg..... two nites is enough. High end shopping at Lotte Department store where China tourist flocked to buy branded luxury items & queue for refunds. The department store was so crowd & noisy. We wandered down to the basement to hunt for food. We found korean condiments like kimchi, fermented squids, anchovies. No worries can pack for you nicely so that you bring home. Spoil for choice....free sample to taste ..."
1668,4.0,"This is a great place to just shop until you drop! This is not your high end shopping. This is where you will find everything from socks to mink coats but they are not in bright lights and marbled floors but street stalls. I love going here. You can also bargain with them. If you do not like the price then just walk away, if they can go down more they will call you back, if that is their final offer they will let you go. Silk purses, beautiful bedding, clothes galore, shoes. Purses are a big thing. Most of the time it will not be the ""real thing."""
1669,2.0,"First day arrived came to MyeongDong to buy lots of cosmetic stuff. I was served by a Chinese lady who speaks fluent Chinese/Korean, she gave me some samples after my purchased. A day later, I went to the same shop but at Sinsa area, then only realized when purchased 2 lipsticks will get another 1 for free. (3 for 2 $). The MyeongDong branch didn't inform me about this nor giving me any free lipstick. I suspect the sales ladies kept for their own use, or other purpose. Will not going back there to purchase anymore. Very touristy area, crowded."
1670,4.0,"Good place to shop for face mask and cosmetics. Sales assistants can communicated in chinese or english, so no issue communicating them if you know the language. The items not very cheap but free gifts are still quite abit. Tax refund office available so you can do a cash refund and continue shopping, however, the tax refund counter not easy to spot. Food wise not bad, should try the myeongdong dumpling."
1671,4.0,"A lot of things to buy especially cosmetics. And I love the food, from local restaurants to coffee bean and starbucks and of course I love the street foods. Relatively safe. A lot of people even at night."

1673,5.0,"Wow! So many stores, so much delicious street food and so many people. Everyone was having fun and so were we! I only wish we had another day to explore. We tried just about every type of street food and loved it all. Bonus tip: Find the dog cafe, grab a refreshment and watch the skateboarding dogs!"
1674,4.0,Love this place. Love the shops ..the food ...the hair salon and the street food. Money changer is at every corner with good rates. A must visit for all tourist.
1675,4.0,My girlfriend and I visited there and find that there are many shops selling cosmetics and fashion products that almost all girls must be crazy there.  It opens till very late night with restaurants.  Dont miss it if you love shopping.

Don't forget to try Korean Traditional Restaurant Owooga - Korean BBQ dish but served with fresh and more varieties of vegetable, delicious bamboo rice as well. This restaurant location is just opposite The Grand hotel."
1677,4.0,"Shopping area! many things to buy here! can be crowded, but the crowd really add up to the hectic atmosphere.  many foods to buy!"
1678,4.0,"This place is literally a bee hive of activity. Street foods, clothes, make up, shoes for which Seoul is known for is in this place. However, HM, Zara, Uniclo have their shops here. It is hard to bargain as prices are generally fixed. Best buys are Korean made leather shoes, shirts, jackets and coats and make up and skin care (Etude House, Face Shop, Skin Food etc.). The side streets have small cafes, bistros and restaurants. For the less adventurous, Mc Donald's and KFC have branches in this area, too. More shopping awaits you in the subway. Stores are open from 10 am to 11 pm."
1679,4.0,"This small area is lined with SO MANY shops offering facial products and make-up, it's believable. There are many branches of the same shop as well (i.e. there was probably 5 branches of each brand on each lane!). I would suggest people read up a little on the products available from the different brands as you can literally lose yourself in the shop. The number of free gifts differ from each shop/ branch so walk around a little to see what are the best deals. If you can't speak Korean, no worries. Most shops would have at least 1 staff member able to speak English and definitely Mandarin."
1680,5.0,"its crazy so is so many shops and shops after shops, things to buy here is not cheap, but there is just so many things to buy.. so there you are lost and found i suggest if you were to stay in Seoul for five days, make sure you come here everyday..  the air is fresh, no pushing, just free and easy to buy anything. (i am very into cosmetic)"
1681,3.0,"Myeongdong is an area with the exact same shops, selling the exact same stuff as anywhere else in Seoul. The only difference is that there is a lot of it. The street food is pretty decent and we definitely enjoyed a few good snacks, but really, the area doesn't inspire the imagination."
1682,5.0,"Constantly evolving, Myeongdong is one of those places that deserve a seasonal visit. The crowd is what makes Myeongdong shine and depending on the state of the currency exchange rate of nearby countries, you will find yourself in a flood of either Japanese or Chinese tourists plugging up the hundreds of shops and restaurants in this dynamic area. The best feature, however, is the street food that line up the pedestrian only streets."
1683,5.0,"This area is absolutely bonkers. Very bright, very loud, very fast. Try everything on offer from the street vendors!"
1684,5.0,"If you like shopping, eating and people watching, Myeongdong is for you. This place has many stores catering to almost everything, from Korean skincare/makeup shops to brand name clothing and fast food restaurants. If you get tired from shopping you can always rest your feet in a nearby coffee. The best time to go here would be the evening since the food vendors come out. It was a great experience."
1685,5.0,This is the place to go for Korean cosmetics and other shopping! Lots of restaurants and food outlets too.
1686,5.0,"Really a very big shopping area! SM's merchandise store also located there. Can't really finish it even with half day! I think we need a day to cover most of the place. G Dragon's clothing store is also located at myeongdong! Not to forget, lots of street food there!"
1687,5.0,"Lots of cheap items and food stalls. Most stalls close around midnight. Lots of beauty shops. If you walk further down the street, you can find a lot of coffee houses for those restless legs."
1688,5.0,"Myeongdong comes alive at night, street food line the main streets. Forget your dinner plans and be sure to try every food store. Prices are quite reasonable with most clothing shops."
1689,4.0,Myeong Dong is basically a place where you can shop for all sorts of female accessories and cosmetics. Its a place of fashion. Apart from that many branded fake goods are available where anyone can purchase it for a very very cheap price. A well crowded street and looks like a Big funfair going on. Packed from noon till night.  at the end of the street has a beautiful Cathedral... known as Myeong dong cathedral. This is where our Pope visited recently when he came over to seoul. Over here you can see or rather feel the presence of holiness as you witness the quiet sactuary underneath the cathedral where the remains of the murdered Matyrs are kept. Really serene and peaceful and you will love this cathedral visit.
1690,5.0,"Myeongdong is a shopper's paradise. There is row after row of beauty shops, women's clothing stores, restaurants, cafes, K-pop stores, and did I mention the beauty shops? You can stock up on fantastic Korean skincare and make-up at very reasonable prices, and most beauty shops will give you free samples, even if you don't buy anything! It's a fun, exciting part of Seoul, and I'd highly recommend it."
1691,5.0,There are so many stops and the visitor center is very helpful. There are a lot of places to stop so you need to have a game plan.
1692,4.0,"Too many people, too crowded! Many places to shop and eat. Avoid Korean national holidays or weekends as more people will be there. There are many street vendors and the prices of the items they sell are reasonable."
1693,1.0,"I've decided to write about this after much thought. I have to say that the shopping experience is overwhelmingly extreme disappointment. If you plan to shop here, I'll advice you: don't! Just go to the airport Duty Free (the Shilla); they just opened a new counter. I've gone through the pricing, it's definitely cheaper! And you won't get the bad experience I had with the shop.  Unlike anything I experience with Korean culture, the shop assistant adopts a mainland China sales approach: push and hard sales. Meaning: non stop statements telling you should buy something, while keep adding products (yes, they take the items and shove it to you) into your hands / basket. What makes it unbearable: she tells you it's star products that everybody keeps coming back to get more (which is why it's in bulk), and that its a hassle and a problem that you made her retrieve only one bottle for you.  The exact experience I had, and the words I was told: 1. You're from xxx country, you guys are rich and able to afford more! 2. People from your country always come and get this in bulk; it's very cheap to them and you should buy it! 3. Don't worry if it's suitable to your skin; all those who tried all come back for more, why not buy in bulk now and save you the hassle? 4. Trust me, the price is really good! Now that we have such promotions, and you'll get tax refund on top of that! And I'll give you some free sample as well!  All the cheap tactics that I'll only get when I was in YaXiu (China) wholesale market. Only sole purpose is to made you buy and spend unnecessarily more to satisfy their sales target.  Of so many shopping trips I had, this is the first surprisingly awful experience I ever encounter in Seoul. I need to ask: what happened to the old virtue Koreans are so proud of? This is as if I'm shopping in China (no offense). But then again, every time I'm went China for shopping, they don't even dare using such cheap tactics on me.  I have to say this again: it's an extremely disappointing experience. Do not shop here! You can get your stuff in the Incheon Airport duty free."
1694,4.0,You'll find tons of local brand stores here! Exit 6 of Myeongdong Station gets you the entrance of the shopping streets. Lotsa of restaurants in the area too. A great place to spend the day here!
1695,5.0,"I could go to this place everyday for eating, shopping, movies, just walking around. It got crammed during weekend. Love the street food here."
1696,5.0,"One of the things you must do in Seoul is definitely shopping. Myeongdong handles that perfectly.  You'll find streets food, restaurants, snacks, gazillion tons of skin care shops (really mean it, you'll have Nature's republic in every street literally).  There's also a big MCM shop here.  You'll have no trouble finding for food here and don't bother to turn back to look for that shop that you've missed, especially if it is a skin care shops as you'll find exactly the same shop the next street.  Most of the shops have some workers that could speak some Mandarin and English."
1697,4.0,"love it love it love it. love the free samples too. I bought a lot to get the free samples tho. They don't really speak english very well so usually when they give you samples they talk to you but once you start responding back in english they back off. If you understand mandarin, don't let them know, the sales people can get pretty annoying. other than that skin care/ cosmetics heaven!"
1698,4.0,"The cosmetics street in Myeongdong is indeed a haven for getting your buys on cosmetics and skincare products! However, it is very very crowded and please take care of your belongings (we lost a phone here and we couldn't get it back)."
1699,5.0,"Easy to go by taxi, great street shopping, good price and quality. Amazing cosmetics shops in the area, wonderful experience, need more than 3 hours to browse around."
1700,4.0,"Restaurants close as early as 9pm and 12mn is the latest. When they are on sale, they are really cheap- from beauty products to clothing.  And also, cat and dog cafes are present in this area. In my case, i love cats so the cat cafe is a heaven place for me. A fee of 8000 won includes a free drink. I love the blueberry latte!  Roam around and prepare your shopping basket and be prepared to be hyper.  You might visit lotte dept store as well and pay a visit in the cathedral to pray (if you are a catholic). English mass is offered only during sunday at 9am.  By the way, if you are going to use credit card to pay for your food, don't hesitate to ask the staff and you might encounter some challenges like what we have encountered (where the staff is not sure if they accept other credit card brand/bank despite of the visa/mastercard/amex/jbc logo on their door."
1701,5.0,Traversing the shopping district go myeongdong makes you feel as if your time there is never enough to take it all in. The buzz and energy of the place keeps you walking to turn the next corner or to explore the next shop. Great shopping district.
1702,5.0,"huge selection of beauty products , great prices....you can try anything you want...you get tons of free samples and gifts with your purchase"
1703,4.0,"If you want to shop in Seoul, this is the place to gravitate to. Lots of shoppers, lots of shops and for lovers of Korean cosmetics, this is paradise. Somehow, there is a certain vibe about this place that makes it great despite the crowds. There are the familiar brands like Uniqlo, Skechers and Adidas and also hip Korean brands.  We also like the street food here like tornado potato and odeng. There are also lots of restaurants here such as the famous Gogung with an artiste playing a traditional Korean musical instrument to entertain us while we eat.  Shop and eat and you will enjoy MyeongDong."
1704,5.0,"we love the food carts selling food. Unfortunately we just ate our lunch before we came to Myeongdong but we ended up stuffing our faces as well. There were carts selling little interesting stuff for the children as well. Prices were not so cheap for some of the food, but were pretty standard prices across all shops."
1705,4.0,"Many shops around here, together with ""the best"" money changers for people who is visiting seoul.  Shops include Uniqlo, Tony Molly, Etude House etc...  Many street food available which are pretty decent, please try them!  Please remember for ask for tax refund if you purchase from those outlets upon spending a certain amount."
1706,5.0,"They say this is the shopping mecca in Seoul and true enough, it really is! We had so much fun here compared to Dongdaemun. The Myeongdong area is a very popular shopping area among young Koreans, mostly women. It has dozens of name-brand stores such as Nike, New Balance, Levis, and others. Despite the extreme winter cold, there were a lot of people in the two times that we went there. This area will get very crowded around lunch time and in the evenings. It is estimated that two million people per day visit Myeongdong and they go here not just for shopping but also for food! This is Seoul's no. 1 shopping district I would say. The heart of Myeongdong is the two main streets that intersect at the center of the block. One begins at Myeongdong Station and the other at Lotte Department Store. The streets are lined cheek-by-jowl with fashion brand stores, cosmetics shops, restaurants, and cafes. From midday when all the shops are open until the late hours of the night when food carts and neon shop signs light up the alleys, the streets of Myeongdong are full of life and buzz from excited shoppers."
1707,4.0,"Small restos, coffee shops, cosmetic stores, shoes and apparel stores lined up side by side that provide shopping options to locals and tourists alike. Not a place for haggling though since most prices are fixed."
1708,3.0,"Well if u like to see a crowd place and love shopping especially cosmetics, then u should come to this place... Its like alleys full of store, mostly cosmetics and clothes... There is also a tourist center where u can have photo with hanbok... Most street sellers are quite nice and very friendly to the tourists... Recommended place!"
1709,5.0,"Usually the titles of attractions listed on TA don't have a description, but the fact that they list ""Hyper Shopping"" with Myeongdong says it all. You either get a fantastic (hyper) shopping experience from seeing and buying, or you will get 'hyper' or over-excited just from seeing what is available ! Don't worry; you will be brought down-to-earth when you run out of money !!  The majority of shops are fashion or cosmetics, with multiple branches of the same store all over Myeongdong. Don't make the mistake of arranging to meet in front of say, Innisfree or Nature Republic - there are at least 4 or 5 outlets just in Myeongdong alone.  Get hold of a map of some sort (see picture) to get your orientation and plan your route through the streets to cover the most ground. There are many restaurants and coffee shops all over if you need a break to rest your feet or get warm in winter. Some of the eateries are on the 2nd or 3rd floors, so look up for their signs while walking.  Most of the shops are open by 10 to 11 am, and don't close till very late. The street vendors selling snacks are there by lunch. Many of the office workers from the surrounding area also come into Myeongdong for lunch or dinner, so some popular restaurants can get crowded, but it's usually a short wait."
1710,5.0,"Almost every night we are there. This is one of the best street shopping we ever had. Prices range as low as ₩1000 to max. We had Kebab, Pomegranate Juice, Rice Cakes and almost all Korean foods. You definitely cannot give this shopping area a miss whrn im Seoul."
1711,4.0,"We really like the feel and energy of this place when we were in Seoul last week that we can here for 2 nights.. haha..  Few tips for fellow TA users :-  1) Dun come too early.. the street vendors will start setting up their stalls around 3+ when I was there during winter.. the fun comes from shopping @ the street stalls and NOT the shops (my own opinion)  2) If you go there, dun forget to visit the M Plaza 5th floor (Seoul Global Culture centre) to wear the hanbok for free and take photos.. go early to book your time slot as no reservation is allowed..  3) prices are fixed so no need to waste time trying to bargain with the sellers.. just have fun looking and eating.. haha..  4) eat the ""Egg Bun"" and a strawberry thingy wrapped in red bean and mochi skin.. haha... very very nice..  just be careful as it can be very crowded when the street stalls are in full swing..."
1712,4.0,"A must go to see the typical shopping nightlife in Seoul. Myeongdong isn't a huge area but lots of shopping to do here, small little shops and big brand names. For local labelled cheap clothing, try dongdaemun first before buying from the shops here. Lots of restaurants and cafes in this area too. So many Korean cosmetic shops in this area as well."
1713,4.0,"I went there on Friday evening & there were many food stalls along the walking street that you can definitely get very full 😋 I tried many different kind of food (I seldom buy food at street stalls but the hygiene standard there was good enough), fruit juice & bought strawberries back to hotel. And, there were lots of Korean cosmetic brands at very good price."
1714,5.0,"A pedestrian walk area where you can shop to your heart's content, look at all the people, eat anything you want to eat."
1715,4.0,"Myeongdong is indeed shopping haven for the ladies, theres streets and streets of shops selling beauty and cosmetics. They'd give you little freebies just as you enter the shop, and if you do purchase some items, they'd throw in even more freebies.  The staff of these shops are rather aggressive in getting you to enter their shop, and it can be rather intimidating. They have a tendency to follow you around and make you try the testers of products, which can put some people off (it definitely did me!).  I did find though that these beauty shops in other areas are cheaper and offer more promotions than the ones at Myeongdong. Even on the same day, in the same shop but a different branch. I did most of my shopping at Edae area (Ehwa Womens University), and I found them to be less intimidating, more informative and much cheaper. They also gave more freebies!  The crowd at Myeongdong is a bit putting off, not even in the shops, but on the streets as well. And people there tend to shove, which put me in an awful mood after a while. All in all, I'd probably do all my further shopping elsewhere."
1716,5.0,All the cosmetic shopping in one place. Should go at night to experience the environment. Lots of food stores along the street. Must try the 32cm high ice cream and their baked egg cakes.
1717,5.0,"So many skincare and makeup shop in here! And most of them will offer discount to tourist. You can find a full set of skincare or makeup products in this heaven! Besides beauty products, this place also has many hidden restaurants which is with cheap price but taste not bad. We spent a lot in this little area! Worth to go!!"
1718,4.0,"Korea is well known for its popular beauty products nowadays. People now not only looking at US or UK products when it comes to beauty products, including skin care products. Once you hit Myeongdong, you will completely lost in that area around that cosmetic shops. It can be a bit overwhelming for first timer (like me). Don't be surprised here you can see 7-8 shops for each brand located in this area. If you are a money spender for beauty products no way you can miss this place when you visit Seoul. The shops here give many promos so you can save money to get more, but mostly for card payment. Here you can find such a well known brand as Etude, The Face Shop, Innisfree, Tony Moly, Holika Holika, Too Cool for School, and so on. Be prepared to spend a lot if you just can't hold your urge to shop :)"
1719,5.0,Great variety of stuff to buy Near to Lotte shopping centre Great range of famous local food to try Late night supper possible Easy access to historical sites
1720,5.0,"I found myself coming back to Myeongdong market a few times during my stay in Seoul. The market has sooo many shops with variety of products & food. You can find just about anything there, in cheap price too! Although perhaps if you don't speak the language bargaining could be challenging. Including ordering food at their small restaurants, coz they have the menu in HANGUL writing without pictures. But then again, this could be an interesting experience, which I think worth the try."
1721,4.0,"The best place for shopping for beauty products. Lots of Beauty product stores line up on this area where good deals can be found. I ended up buying a bag-full of cosmetics like the BB and CC Creams, Snail Cream, Cleansing oils, Make up Remover, and a lot more."
1722,4.0,lots of things you can buy here with good price. the best thing to shop is definitely the skincare stuffs. most of the shops here are cosmetics n skincare shops!
1723,5.0,"Myeongdong is another shopper's paradise because you can find everything here from clothing,shoes, bags, cosmetics, food items & souvenirs & some stores are open till midnight. Since it's also a tourist attraction, expect crowds of people here,too.Lotte Dept Store & other foreign brands are also here. So you have so many choices if you don't like to go through so many people."
1724,5.0,"Went there with still 0'C in the city and there are lots of SALE! Lovely to buy cosmetics, lots of cheap, facemasks for pasalubong or for gifts to ladies and winter clothes for the whole family!  Bags and sneakers for kids are on sale too at this time - January."
1725,4.0,"Those who love to shop for cosmetics and fashion, this is the place for you to be. Etude House, Face Shop, Innisfree, etc. are aplenty here in Myeongdong. Only thing is they like to repeat the same shop down the aisle. Overall, it is a good experience for those who love to carry big shopping bags."
1726,5.0,"Myeongdong has so much to offer, from shopping to food tripping. I had a great time!!! You can spend all day just in Myeongdong"
1727,5.0,"Lots of cosmetics to buy, so many people, so much street food. Interesting. There were a lot of mask going for 1-1. Buy one and get one free. There were a lot of tourist there. We tried the sweet potato fries (3000 won), coal grilled octopus/squid (6000 won), mandoo (10 for 8000 won), ho-tteok (sweet yeast flour with brown sugar with sunflower seeds and pine nuts, 1000-2000won, sweet egg bread (1000 won), nutella crepe (3000 won). We didn't need to have dinner at all!"
1728,4.0,Also you better bring a gps with so as not to get lost walking in circles.... Found my nongshim socks for some friends in Australia here!...
1729,5.0,"great during the day to shop and fun at night also. Nice mixture of local atrist, local handmade shops, local products and a few trendy boutiques, and name brand stores. lots of interesting cafes and eateries to try. there's something for every age and group of people here."

1731,4.0,"If you want a taste of shopping and street food and the noise of a large, international city then Myeongdong is the place. Clothes, souvenirs, food from shopkeepers who almost all speak English - or enough to sell you something. Still, you do not have to spend money to enjoy walking around this place and soaking it in."
1732,3.0,"There are sooo many shops around here. Selling cosmetics, clothings, bags etc. What you need, you can find it here. But some of the shops really sell expensive items. There are also restaurants, cafes. The shops closes at 12mn."

1734,5.0,"There is a noodle place that is tucked inside an alley, they serve North Korean style noodle, a must try. Cat lovers (that's me) would be delighted to find that there are cat cafes there."
1735,5.0,"I already visited this place more than 20 times. Sometimes I visited this place more than once a week. You won't get bored since you can find everything here. For tourists, this is the best market for you since all of the staffs here can speak English well and some of them can speak other languages too, such as Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and more. You can also find a lot of famous restaurants here that it can be said this place is heaven for shopping and culinary"
1736,5.0,Opens up at about 6pm and starts to BUZZZ at about 8pm. I advise that if you arrive to your hotel in the evening to just drop your bags and go straight out to the streets.  Many ATM's around that you can just pull out South Korean won for cash (its a market so you need cash.)  Go hungry and snack along all the stands like the locals do. Then head upstairs into one of the bars overlooking one of the streets and people watch!
1737,3.0,"Myeongdong is a good one stop place to get all your Korea's shopping need but that is about it. (If you only have 1 day to shop, thats it.) The service at the Myeongdong main area is the worse. If you go into cosmetic shops and you don't look like you will spend, those foreign store assistants would not even entertain you. Getting a snide remark is not uncommon from them. And if you do look like you are going to spend a lot, they are going to follow you throughout the whole time you are in there because they get commission from the sales, so they are just gonna stick to you like crazy glue.  The street food are pretty good though and Myeongdong street food is one of the places that always develop new Korean street food.  Then again, there is always Hongdae and Edae, and the experience there always beats Myeongdong."
1738,3.0,"This area has a lot of shops, many major names, and a fair assortment of smaller ""boutique"" operators. As others have commented there are a very large proportion of shops - and branches of the same shop - selling skin care and beauty products.  There were a lot of tourists and locals when we visited, on a Friday afternoon, and we spent a good three hours walking around the warren of lanes in the general area. There are no shortage of eating venues, coffee shops and food stalls should you find yourself flagging.  Worth a visit for the experience, and if you want to buy skin care products, you will be spoilt for choice."
1739,5.0,"Plenty of cosmetics shops for the ladies to feast. Don't be surprise to find the same shop at different streets. There are also plenty of clothes. Quality differ from medium to good. In the evening, food stalls will start lining the streets. Myeongdong is also more crowded in the evening and at night."
1740,4.0,"Upon reaching the station exit, you'll be greeted with food stalls.  I would recommend coming in the evening onwards because that's where stall vendors come out to put out their stalls at the roads. So you'll get more activities going on. But that also means, more crowd.  If you come in the afternoon, it's fine too, you won't really miss out a lot. And you'll get to walk the streets more easily.  Shopping here is mostly for cosmetics than clothes. Fixed shops are your usual H&M, American Apparel ect while store vendors are your usual korean flea market kind.  Remember to try out the egg bread and other roadside food stalls!"
1741,4.0,"Lots of stores to choose from, from food to cosmetics. Beauty shops normally give free samples. Just walk around and you'd end up having lots of stuff. You could be easily lost as there are many streets but I suggest to wander around the area to scope for the really good finds that are hidden in some places.  Don't be excited to buy everything you want from Myeongdong. Some items can be bought at other markets at a lower price."
1742,5.0,"Countless shops selling a huge varieties of beauty products! I think I went in to the same shop repeatedly but no...same shop on different streets though... You can find frantically every single stuff for your top to toe beauty needs. Faceshop, Skinfood, Too Cool For School, Nature Republic and many more. Excessive supplies I would say but that is why the Koreans ladies are so beautiful."
1743,5.0,"highly recommend for girls. best shopping area and for food, but you might see same cosmetics store in every corner. I walked to myeong dong twice a day, I will always book my hotel in Meoyng dong area. very convenient"

1745,5.0,"Really like this wonderful place for shopping and eating. Many cafes around to indulge in. Children will simply love the many shops selling K-pop music CDs, poster and other souvenirs. A good spread of local and international retail brands, average and high-end fashion and clothing etc. Great place to pick up Korean fashion that this both reasonable and trendy."

1747,4.0,"Myeong-dong is an interesting shopping district. Lots and lots of food places, shopping areas for street clothes or boutique clothes. It is definitely a shopping haven for everyone. Food places consist of authentic Korean-type restaurants and fast-food outlets. Dozens and dozens of beauty shop outlets as well. A definite must-see."
1748,4.0,"Many thing you may buy at this place, shirts, the cosmetics, exotic street foods and others. you will find many interesting items to buy. many shuttle bus from the hotels will stop at this area."
1749,4.0,"The title says it all. Walk down the street of Myeongdong and you will find 8-10 skincare shops per block. Walk down to the next block and you will find the same skincare shops but in a different arrangement. There were many clothing stores as well but some are the usual stores like Uniqlo and Zara but others are small boutiques selling extremely expensive clothes which I think is overpriced and overrated. For made in Korea clothing, it's cheaper to shop in Dongdaemun or Nanta. There is also a big flagship store of MCM leather goods but seeing every asian tourist carrying one, it immediately became a turnoff for me to purchase one. The street food there is wonderful. I love the idea of a cart selling cut grapefruit right out of the peel. Healthy and delicious. When i was there, this cart was right in front of Nanta Myeongdong near a Burger King. Fresh lemonade was also essential when walking around in the sun. In short, a very convenient place with everything you need. Most of the food we've tried here were good."
1750,4.0,"This place is like a Grand bazaar of IStanbul. Lots to see but not much to buy. Quality of street food are not high- Just take a look. Anyway, this is definetly a fun place to visit. Very close to palaces of Seoul."
1751,4.0,"Imagine rows and rows of shops and cafes congregating at one area - Myeodeong. Yes, that made it a shopping paradise for us all.  There were many cafes and fashion outlets - gorgeous Korean dresses going for reasonable prices. There were accessories shops that offers a lot of glitter and blink blink, succeeding to catch the eyes of passerbys easily.  Best of all, there were many skincare shops with skincare products going for incredibly good prices. There were many exotic brands that we have not heard of, because they were not imported over here.  The retail crew were all very friendly and generous- whenever we passed by a skincare brand we would receive many types of samples without having to buy anything - facial cream, facial scrubs, facial moisturizers etc.  For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit: http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/kaptivating-korea.html"
1752,5.0,"This area is packed with multiple skincare and beauty shops (Nature republic, Missha, TonyMoly, Seatree, and repeat shops within 100metres away). You will also find ABC Mart (great deals on shoes), branded Sportwear, Fashion wear,.. etc... with also some pull-carts on interesting accessories like phone cases, scarfs, etc... and SOCKS too (so many interesting designs /characters and costs only KRW1000 per pair, its hard to resist!) Lots of great food eateries too, and especially in summer season, the cold noodles is a must (you can have it dry&spicy, or in an iced soup base)."
1753,5.0,Shopping paradise - certain shops are tax-free but you need to ask during check-out. Great place to experience local street food and there are plenty of interesting things to see. Word of caution: public toilets are limited in the streets.
1754,4.0,"This is a shopping destination that some, but not all, shoppers will enjoy. It's generally chock full on people on weekends and many evenings. If you don't appreciate being pressed and shoved in all directions at once, or shouted at in about five different languages, you might want to stay for a half-hour at best to take a few photos, and then head to a different shopping district outside of the CBD. Personally, I enjoy the lively atmosphere, although I enjoy it less now that the novelty has worn off.  In terms of fashion and beauty, you can find pretty much whatever you need in this area. There are plenty of good restaurants and street food stalls around, and if your tastes are a bit more high-end, take a short stroll over to the Shinsegae or Lotte department stores. Personally, I head here when I plan on spending time at Forever 21 or H&M, since these chains are rare in Korea."
1755,4.0,"All major brands of Korean cosmetics and skincare are found here. Most are Chinese-speaking, catering to people who speak Chinese Mandarin. Crowded with vehicles passing through. Street food is nice. Myeongdong Dumplings is a must-try. There are money-changers for those who need more KRW, but the rate is not as good"
1756,4.0,"This place is really a cosmetic paradise! Brands such as missha, tony moly, holika holika, the face shop, nature republic, etude house, primera etc. can be found here! The more you shop, the more freebies you get! It's really a wonderful place. I wish I have more time to spend here! There are many delicious street food here as well! You don't have to worry that you'll starve while you shop to your heart's content. It's a must-visit place if you are planning to come Seoul for great cosmetics and facial / beauty products harvest!"
1757,5.0,I would love to spend more time there! I couldn't go to every shop there while I Was with my daughter.

1759,5.0,"The place to go to purchase Korean cosmetics at heavily discounted prices. However, Chinese speaking staff are extremely pushy and would do anything to ensure a sale. The place to go to savour street food. Food is prepared in hygenic conditions. Many restaurants too"
1760,5.0,"This is such a vibrant and amazing shopping area. During the day it is pretty quiet and has just the usual shops open, but as night descends the whole place comes to life. Suddenly vendors appear from all over with their carts of wares, and really one can buy just about everything. The area has a very good Seoul Information Centre which we just discovered this time. They were so informative and really helpful, also selling various Korean things. In the area there are so many places to eat, all the usual ones, but also a wealth of other places, especially in the quieter side streets. There are also some lovely hotels in the area, and we have stayed at the Savoy and the Metro, both of which are very fully booked , so one has to book early. The subway is also right there which makes access so easy!! I have visited it many times and will return again when I visit Seoul!!"
1761,5.0,"If you aim to shop for lots of cosmetic, this is the best place!  There are Etude, The Face Shop, Skin Food, Missha, Innisfree, Natural Repubilc and some other not-so-top brands. If time permits, don't buy yet when you first enter one of these shops. There may be another selling the same brand down the street which offers better deal. I bought lots of ginseng masks from one Natural Republic store which had a ""buy one free two"" offer. I only paid for 10 but got 30 masks! Other stores only offered ""buy one free one"".  Besides shopping for cosmetic, there are countless eateries in this area too."
1762,5.0,This place is everyone shopping paradise for those who just love to shop till you drop dead gorgeous. Just make sure to melt your credit cards away making plenty of purchase. Dont be afraid to drop dead while shopping as food is just within reach... Every turn and every where you can just see these restaurant that sell every kind of korean and international food.
1763,5.0,"I have to say that a trip to Seoul won't be completed if you don't go to Myeongdong. I always go there more than once every trip. Good shops, good food, nice crowd, and a new shop pop up every time! If you love Korean cosmetics, this is a place where you can get every brands. If you are into K-fashioin, this is a must place also. highly recommended!"
1764,4.0,"This is a large shopping area just next to the metro. Many many shops and side streets with different types of cafes and restaurants.  There are many many Korean cosmetic outlets in this area, most have MULTIPLE shops, so that takes away some of the charm of the place.  If you get lost or need help, there are these young people dressed in red (Tourist Information) ready to help in English, Mandarin or Japanese.  I love the street carts and street food available here!"
1765,5.0,"This place abounds with cosmetic stores, food stalls, shoe and clothes stores. We love Korean cosmetics for its price and quality: Nature Republic, Skin Food, Missha, La Neige, Étude House, Tony Moly, Face Shop etc. An added bonus is that most stores are generous in giving samples away together with your purchase. We were fortunate that most stores were on sale. Buy what you need as soon as it is on sale because a few days after, they go back to regular price and the store will feature another product at a discounted price. We tried soft serve ice cream at one of the side streets that had a long long line. The ice cream twirl was about a foot tall for only 2000 won. We had the green tea/vanilla flavor."
1766,5.0,"This place was buzzing with activity even at 11pm (local time) which was amazing. It is filled with 1000 of stores - including restaurants, street food and a huge variety of shops (male and female). The buildings are also 4 levels (or more in some cases) which means the amount of shops just increases. There is also several streets or isles which you must go down to get the entire experience. Both points just adding to the shopping experience."
1767,5.0,"This is basically shopping heaven and food street all rolled into one. If you have money but not sure where to spend it, this is the place. Fashion, accessories, hair salons, even baby clothes, cafes, restaurants are available at every corner. Sales staff from skincare shops shout out to you in Mandarin (well done!) and flood you with info while enticing you with samples just to walk into their shops. The street foods are delicious and very tempting. Try the towering soft serve - and eat it very quickly! If you want serious shopping, plan at least the whole day here."
1768,4.0,"We arrived at Seoul early evening and went directly to Myeongdong's shopping area which is right across our hotel and started our eating and shopping spree. It was right after christmas and the neon lights all carried a strong air of festivity. Although it was -7 C, the place was packed with people, locals and tourists alike. There are plenty of stores including brand names for the serious shoppers and hawkers also lined the street sides. I noticed that cosmetics and personal care items are hotly pursued items. My interest was however more on the street food in particular the curly potato chip, the fish cake with bean paste filling and the egg muffin all freshing baked and served piping hot which were delicious and heart warming in the cold weather. It was a pity that we started our trip that night with a heavy dinner and so little room was left for the many other yummy street food items like squids, fish cakes etc etc. We returned to our hotel around 10pm but the place was still streaming with people. I was particularly impressed with the cleanliness and orderliness of the place, and one feels safe to roam around. It is a must go place for anybody who happens to be in Seoul, and indeed, we went back three nights in a row to continue with our shopping expedition!"
1769,5.0,"whatever you want, you can find them all in Myeongdong. Lucky for me, i stay at euljiro-3 ga (Kimchee Myeongdong Guesthouse) so its a real good walkable distance for me. Varieties of cafe such as Holly's, Twosome, cafe bean to name a few is all there. The whole streets is always soo cheerful regardless of the hours & cold weather. You can find all sorts of delicacies there, street side snacks (varieties of them!!), nice fashion & accessories, shoes, socks, cakes, bags OMAIGOD! I can just stay there for hours to just explore every nook & cranny of it! Guys who are tired of shopping with your gf can just pop by any cafes there, its literally all around you. Compare to Dongdaemun, I'll say Myeongdong is much more interesting."
1770,4.0,This was a typical popular shopping area in a big city. The streets are packed with stores lining the streets and vendors trying to pull you into each of their stores.
1771,5.0,"Name all the things you want and you would find it here! Very big shopping area, super delicious street food, lovely people and very clean area! If you are in Seoul, this is a super definite must experience shopping place! You shouldn't miss it!"
1772,4.0,"This place is a huge shopping area that you can have everything to buy like clothes, make-up and foods. Every time you enter to cosmetic store, they will give you a free sample like facial mask, facial foam etc..If you're tired of shopping try to eat the different street foods, the food are tasty and delicious."
1773,4.0,"One of the many places for shopping. Grab a map of the area so that you will not get lost. Visited this place almost every night and each visit has a surprise find. Lots of food and cafes too. If you are an early bird, start the day with beakfast there and slowly spend the rest of the day shopping and eating at Myeongdong."
1774,3.0,"This is a busy shopping part! there are tons of stores, but you have to be very young to find something here,.. for the 30+ there is already not too much,... and what they have you can also buy in other places and malls"
1775,3.0,"That this shopping district is crowded is no problem, you can not expect anything else. But what really is little bit crazy is that there seems hardly no other shops than for make up. Even fashion shops are only a few and if you want to buy something like a camera or a computer this is totally the wrong place."
1776,3.0,"A vast shopping, bar and restaurant area mainly targeted at the younger set. Busy, especially at weekends, this is great for brand name products but lacks more Korean traditional outlets that can be found in nearby Insadong. The korean shop staff can be a bit unfriendly and english is not often spoken as mostly the shops cater for the many tourists from nearby mainland China."
1777,4.0,"We arrived Saturday evening in Seoul and, as soon as we were checked into our hotel, we headed out for the half mile walk to Myeongdong on recommendation of a family member who'd already visited.  Mind-boggling is a good starting description of the approx six block by six block shopping area. Every street was jam-packed at ten p.m. There must have been 5-6 thousand people hanging out (and actually shopping) in these few blocks.  The stores were all still open at 10 pm, including shops several floors upstairs from ground level access. You'll find dozens of coffee shops and hundreds of restaurants. The middle of the avenues are packed with booths of street vendors selling anything from beautiful hair wear, to socks, to T-shirts, to curled potatoes fried on a stick. Or ice cream.  Unlike the street markets of Thailand or Cambodia or Bali, nobody solicits your business, except a few people offering massages. You're free to wander and gawk at the merchandise undisturbed, till your heart's content.  Some stores are franchises you'd find in the west and are quite pricey - others offer wares at extremely reasonable prices.  There's something for everyone here. And if you enjoy people watching, you probably can't find a better venue."
1778,3.0,This is cosmetics heaven. Don't worry if you can't get in one of the stores because there will be another one around the corner. Go in and get samples. Street food vendors line up the main road. It's interesting to see how cosmetics play a part in the life of Seoul.
1779,4.0,"This is an interesting place for a tourist to visit with many street food, and surprisingly the prices are reasonable."
1780,5.0,"No matter what time of day, you'll find this busy shopping and food area highly interesting. Many small shops abound around the many large department stores: Lotte, Shinsegae, Migliore, and M Plaza to name a few. Grab some street food or try the famous Myeongdong Kyoja restaurant. I was fortunate enough to see a KPOP group perform a free concert on the streets!"
1781,4.0,"Myeongdong is a must go place in Seoul. Best to go during evening to night. As all the street vendor that sell food and others comes alive. What you want there will have it. Best for shopping, eating, and hang out with friends."
1782,4.0,"Everything is in Myeongdong! F21, H&M, Nike, Etude, Nature Republic etc. Be sure to try the street food! Take the subway and get off at Myeongdong Line 4 Exit 6."
1783,3.0,"Terrible, everywhere they write about wide range of clothes choice, but there is nothing to choose. Polyether is every where and they call it designers clothes!!! Don't spend your money for this..."
1784,3.0,Big shopping street in Seoul. many restaurant theater so many shop and cosmetic. but most cosmetic there only korean brand i can see.
1785,5.0,Myeongdong is a must go for shopping and for food. Here will be filled with tourists and shoppers all day. There are big brands and small brands but the food here is exceptional.
1786,5.0,"Myeongdong was a place we would come back to time and time again when we were living in Seoul! There is lots of American stores there, like Forever 21, the Gap or Louis Vuitton but also tons of Korean souvenirs and stores. You can find everything from cheap street food to high end restaurants (some of the best spicy rice in the city) when you get hungry. There are vendors all over the streets as they block cars form driving in the area. Whether you are looking for clothes, cosmetics, souvenirs, or just a coffee shop you will find it all in this area! It is crowded in the evening and on the weekend so be prepared to wade through people unless you get there on a week day. However, Korea is very safe so you don't have to worry too much about pick-pockets or anything of that nature but of course you should always be cautious."
1787,4.0,"It's a very crowded area, so if you don't like crowds, it's better to avoid it. On the other hand, it's a great place to shop, not expensive, accessible, with many big shops and street vendors. You can find pretty much anything clothes, hygiene and accessory related. There are also some inovation stores. It's cool :)"
1788,4.0,"I used to think Myeongdong is just a place to buy beauty products, but I was so wrong. There are so many things to buy, from clothes to shoes to bags and accessories. I bought a pair of boots for $19 USD and the quality is quite good!  And when you are hungry, there are street stalls selling all sorts of food and even gigantic balls of candy floss!  Wear a good pair of walking shoes and shop till you drop!"
1789,4.0,"Loving the shopping here, althought usually very crowded and some things are overpriced. Got really cheap bags for 10 000 won here."
1790,5.0,There's a whole lot of shops there where you could buy just about anything. I enjoyed the cosmetic shops as everything was on sale and everything was so affordable. Another great thing about this area is that there's a lot of food shops to choose from and all with reasonable prices. If you want a quick bite you can also purchase street snacks that look amazing and affordable as well. Definitely one of the best places for shopping in Seoul.
1791,5.0,"Instead of scouring so many malls for different things, this is the one-stop place to get most if not all of your shopping needs. Food and drinks outlets are aplenty too. It's street shops so the atmosphere is also exhilarating rather than be inside a building."
1792,5.0,"Not to be missed when you visit Seoul. Many cosmetic shops, almost one every 5 stores away. Clothes, accessories, bags, and many more! All women will love this place. Once I stepped into a cosmetic store, I would definitely come out with an additional bag! :)  Besides shopping, there are also many restaurants. Korean food, Japanese food, Chinese food, western food, etc., you will not be short of choices. Try Myeongdong dumpling and Wangbijib BBQ. We loved it! There are also food stalls along the streets.  Glad that we stayed 4 nights at Myeongdong :)"
1793,4.0,"personally, I like to check out local brands when I travel. beanpole, codes combine and SPAO are all located on the same street here.  I deliberately made a separate visit on a sat morning before the shops opened and the streets were still fairly deserted, it was quiet and the alleys were beautiful, took some wonderful photos."
1794,5.0,"Loved this area, all you can do is shop and eat and IT IS AMAZING!! Talk about bright lights, big city! We literally went from one beauty shop to another, and another and another... almost never ending. We love love love InnisFree and Etude House! Amazing product and really great material used."
1795,3.0,this is the shopping heaven for girl. pricing is not really cheap. but however there is a lot of boutique shop over here. as well as renowned fashion brand.
1796,5.0,"Myeongdong was great! All the Korean cosmetics stores like Skin Food, Banila Co. Etude House etc were all beside each other. It was such a treat especially because they were having some promotions. International brands such as h&m and Zara were also there. There are a lot of restaurants and street food around so you will never go hungry after a day of shopping. I'm already excited for my next trip to Seoul!"
1797,4.0,"If you love shopping, pls don't miss Myeongdong. You can find everything there from cosmetic to souvenir. Almost of korean cosmetic brands are located there as well as famous clothing brands. However, if you wanna shop high end brands, you can cross the street to Shinsegae or Lotte shopping malls. Also you can find many good restaurants & convenient stores around."
1798,5.0,"This area is the reason most people travel to Seoul. Shopping, dining and walking. Crowded every single day!"
1799,4.0,"Based on some bloggers and reviewer, Myeongdong is a must visit shopping area or at least you have to know like what Myeongdong is. I didn't have much time in Seoul ( 4 days only) so I went to Myeongdong with purpose to buy Nature Republic and got more samples here, but it did not happened .... so I suggested just go to any cosmetic store anywhere if you didn't have much time, it would give same amount of samples.  In myeongdong I tried street snack Walnut and bought a Korean stamp (bargain for it!). Many restaurants, stores and stands sells anything.. so it always crowded."
1800,4.0,"Myeongdong is basically a place to shop. There are many malls, shops, restaurants, etc. in that area. You can easily spend hours there shopping. and when you are tired, just find a cafe to sit and rest, and when hungry, just find a place to eat.  One of the things I like about Myeongdong is the street food. As you shop along the streets, you will encounter pushcarts selling street food - don't miss tasting the culture of Seoul. There are spicy rice cakes, fish cake, pan fried red bean pastry, cuttlefish, to name a few.  You will also find many local and international brands represented in this shopping area."
1801,5.0,Myeongdong is Seoul's shopping mecca for tourists and locals alike. People never get tired of going through the alleys and sifting though the shops to find good deals and stuff on sale.
1802,5.0,"I stayed at Prince Hotel which is directly opposite the Myeongdong street. Full of shopping and eateries. It is also within walking distance to Lotte Departmental Store where you can get all the duty free items upstairs. There are a few eateries that you must try in Myeongdong such as the Ginseng Chicken soup, Korean Style BBQ and Korean Style Fried Chicken. There are many more there which I have not got the chance to try due to my small appetite which is something that I regret. If you in Korea for cosmetic shopping, Myeongdong is also a place for you because it is full of their local cosmetic shop such as Etude House, Nature Republic, Clio, Skin Food etc.  Definitely a regret if you are in Seoul and did not visit Myeongdong."
1803,4.0,"As per title, you can get them at much cheaper price as compared to my country. There are a lot of street foods too. If you are looking at clothes, GoToMall at express bus terminal or ewha womens university."
1804,5.0,"OMG! this is my favorite place.. yes once is never enough.. i just go to myongdong 4 times.. so addicted! buying so many stuffs, cosmetics and also eating and drinks korean snack street! i like it!! i will miss crowded in myeongdong! when im back to korea again! i will go to myeongdong again! again! and again! i love it! this is girl town!! heavenly!!!"
1805,4.0,"They've got everything here: shopping, dining, etc. but the most popular are cosmetics shops selling the latest BB,CC creams and beauty products.  The shops normally open around 10 am and the outdoor food market starts as soon as its dark normally around 6-7 pm. Its an exciting market at night since everyone just strolls around to do some shopping and eating."
1806,5.0,Plenty of things to buy from clothes to shoes to makeups to masks. You'll never run out of things to do. Eat from push carts. Fight through the throngs of crowd. Sit down & relax in a cafe. It's never boring here.
1807,3.0,"You can actually skip it.. Waste of time. Try the mall really better than wasting your energy and time, theres actually nothing so good to see or an xtra ordinary to get amused or amazed.. Hope point taken"
1808,5.0,"Myeongdong is definitely the place to be for active nocturnals who love shopping with an undeterred passion. Myeongdong... Hip bubbly Korean music blaring from unknown sources... iridescent neon lights from above that seem to change in vibrancy at various distances. What more can I say? Although It's as beautiful as any man-made city can be, it exudes an air of excellence in its trendiness, making it a basic Mecca for shoppers. A definite and infinite yes where its complexion at night will undoubtedly evoke a series of 'oohs' and 'aahs'. A must also is to try the 32 inch or whatever ice-cream... just sayin'."
1809,5.0,"A place where we observed the culture of seoul younger generation today , there were great restaurants and especially interesting are the stalls along the street , while in the midst of some famous shops. Great place to shop for korean cosmetic products , spoil for choice. We love it as it was relaxing just strolling and looking at the shops and stall and sitting at the opened concepts coffee cafe watching the world pass by."
1810,4.0,"Sigh. This place really ruins my tight budget. With endless cosmetics stores, variety clothing, shoes, bags, etc etc stores, cafes, how can you not end up spend more than you initially planned?  End up coming almost every night before going back to our guesthouse (Namsan Guesthouse) which is very near to the shopping place. Not only to shop but just looking around (window shopping).  Bought cool bagpacks, cute stocking, korean merchandise, nice cloths, cosmetics, etc etc. A must go for ladies (!), a should go for men(? Well you can find cool shoes, bags, etc. lol)."
1811,5.0,"this place is so awesome, when i come back to my country, feel like want to go to myeondong back, n just leisure around..the price not that cheap, but it is better rather than hongik area, and you can find everything here :D"
1812,5.0,"This place has it all. It has tonnes of shops selling cosmetics, clothes, shoes and of course food. It is a must go destination if you are visiting Seoul. Good place to stay as well as it is easier to get to other parts of Seoul."
1813,5.0,"You can get just about anything here. If you have a limited time in Seoul, this is probably the best place to go shopping. You will also find many restaurants there serving all kind of food."
1814,4.0,"Just like Osaka's Shinsaibashi, Myeongdong is Seoul's national shrine for shopping. If you're looking for K-pop paraphernalia, Korean fashion labels, Korean cosmetics and brand name stuff, this is the place to go.  Streets are covered so you can shop without worrying about the sun or rains. Some shops and restaurants open late in the afternoon and throughout the night. The district is conveniently located being a few subway stops from Gyeongbukgung and Seoul Station."
1815,3.0,I don't really fancy this place as it is too crowded and the non english speaking sellers are not helping most of the time. Just like petaling street in Malaysia with better choices. I gave up in bargaining.
1816,4.0,"If you love to shop and people watch, this is the place. From the amazing luxury department stores to department stores for kids to the street market on Saturday night, this place was jumping! The crowd was friendly and they say to watch for pickpockets but we had no problems. Lots of street food and entertainment and August is a month-long sale event so go in the evening when its cooler and be prepared for an experience unlike any other."
1817,4.0,"OMG!.. I can spend the whole day here just to browse the area and could not get enough of it. it was only on our third night we stay in the hotel near to this place and I was so amaze with the shop, restaurant and much more. The shop is more to middle range brand such as Zara, Uniqlo and for Korean cosmetic all are available here. They also have people which I believe from tourism dept who help tourist and hand out the area map as well helping to translate... overall was good experience ^^"
1818,4.0,"You could spend a whole day here shopping like crazy and not see it all. So after a few hours I got pretty thirsty and we stepped into a good little cafe/restaurant. There are so many good ones to choose from and all reasonably priced. I wish I could have remembered the name of this one. Anyway after 5 beers and 4 bottles of makkoli the two of us stumbled out and then had to try some of the street food - notably those delicious deep fried chicken skewers.  So for those of us not interested in shopping all day with our significant other, there are some other more enjoyable options to occupy yourself with while the ladies are running around all day. Just make sure you make an easy to find rendezvous spot because this area is huge."
1819,4.0,"With shops like F21 and Zara and local brands like SPAO, its a shopping heaven there. I would recommend visiting during late afternoon as the streets start coming alive with street vendors at night. Visit the fixed shops in the day and visit the street shops at night."
1820,5.0,"Loved loved loved this place!!! H&m,zara , forever 21 to name a few with some shops including forever 21 opened from midnight until 10PM. These shops had western sizes and were massive! if you live here like me this is an absolute find!"
1821,4.0,"if u're looking for something... u can definately find it here but expect to have it at tourist prices...  Street food changes as the season changes but there are a few must tries::  - Keranbbang (egg bread) - Hotdog with fries on it. - Grilled Squid - Grilled Chicken Skewer w leek - Kamja Tang (Potato Soup) is not bad too... along the row of SPAO and after Uniqlo...  *SPECIAL MENTION::  - Seek out the Cat Cafe if u're a feline lover... its off the main street in the alley between BSX and New Balance. Currently above Onitsuka Tiger. Its abt 8,000won- 12,000won for a drink and u can stay as long as u like. Ask for ""kan-shik""(snacks) @2,000won to feed the cats!  - check out and compare prices even if its between the same brands!!! seek out the shops off the main alley, they tend to give more freebies =D"
1822,5.0,"If you go to Seoul and miss Myeongdong, then you have missed out! The neighborhood comprises narrow alley ways, lined with shops on either side. These feature an assortment of clothing, accessories, trinkets....you name it. And to boot, the prices are far reduced from what the malls are charging. Definitely worth a half day if you are a serious shopper and you are looking for bargains. Expect big crowds, especially where local celebrities make an appearance. It's quite the affair!"
1823,4.0,It is a massive place filled with ppl. I bought some skincare products for my wife. There are many restaurant and cafes nearby. The feeling of sitting inside a cafe watch ppl outside shopping like crazy is very interesting. The foods and drinks here are very nice!
1824,5.0,"The abundance of skin care products, clothing, accessories and Lotte Department Store at this location is one of the best."
1825,3.0,"I find that this place is too 'touristy' and too many repeated cosmetic shops. You can easily find 5 of each well-known brandshop e.g. Aritaum, Faceshop, etc.  There are some clothing stores worth a visit but depends on individual taste, you may not buy anything from here. My wife and I did not stay long for shopping. We had our lunch here and honestly left without buying anything."
1826,4.0,Adrenaline overdrive!! Its a great place to shop and dine! Make sure to check our Myeongdong Gyoza and BBQ Noodle for a great meal! Love how cosmetic shops (except Etude) give freebies just for you to check out their stores!
1827,5.0,"This are has all the Korean cosmetics and skin care brands. The salesgirls out front entices you into the store with a free gift (usually a box of cotton wool or mask). The stores here usually bundle their products so you usually have to buy a pack of 10 masks or 3 hand lotions. When you do make a purchase, the cashier throws it a whole bunch of samples for you. However, I had bought some masks from the FaceShop counter in Lotte Mart before going to Myeongdong, and found that the price of the face masks I bought there was a little cheaper than at Myeongdong. Do check and make comparisons before making your purchase here. Remember to print out the discount coupons on the visitkorea.com website so you can get a discount at some of the stores here. If you're feeling hungry, this place has restaurants, cafes and street food that can fill your tummy. We had a seafood lunch at one of the alleys which was quite good."
1828,5.0,"Great shopping in Seoul with a lot of shops special Korean cosmetics, fun to walk around myeongdong in late afternoon to evening. if you are shopper and like everything about Korea, this place must go! :D"
1829,5.0,"The best place to shop for make-up & skincare. Most shops are generous with giving out samples. The same popular brands have shops along every street and turn.  The major brands all have tax-free shopping. Just ask for tax-return when making payment and they will print out the tax return slip quickly and easily.  Most shops will have a chinese-speaking sales staff if you speak only Chinese.  There are tourist information volunteers situated at the center of MyeongDong. Some can speak English, Japanese or Chinese. I think they are volunteers there to practise speaking the language. There wear red vests with red hat and are friendly and helpful. They have this MyeongDong map that is very useful. My friends approached them several times asking for information, or where to go for certain food and they would circle out the best place on the map.  Beware of cab-drivers out to rip you off. On our first night there, we were trying to catch a cab at around 11pm. We saw a line of cab drivers waiting there and when we approached him, he told us there were midnight surcharges and told us it cost us 40k won to get to our destination (usual was definitely under 10k). In the end we took the subway home)."
1830,5.0,"Great place for cosmetics, fake jewellery, trendy shoes. Good food. Try street food. Naemdum market and Lotte store alsoclose by."
1831,4.0,"You can buy anything, anywhere, from kimchi favoured seaweed to upmarket fashion. Myeongdong dumplings is a must try"
1832,5.0,"If you need somenthing just enter Lotto World and move via bridges from building to building. Huge choice, although a pricey place if looking for brands"
1833,5.0,"If you are looking for a trendy hip area that offers not only shopping and gifts for all ages and types, but lots of food - good restaurants, cafes and very local Korean food, Myeong-dong is an area you should not miss!  Dongdaemum was good for clothes and fashion, and nearby Myeong-dong - Namdaemun market, excellent if you are looking for gifts, touristy stuff etc. However, Myeong-dong hyper shopping district has a lot more to offer.  If you are a 1st timer, be sure not to miss this place, especially those of you looking for beauty products. You will be surprise to find that Faceshop is no longer THE beauty product shop. There are many more that has sprouted out, and that are just as good."
1834,5.0,"Everyone that has been to Korea said that shopping in Korea was a bit expensive. And I tended to agree with them, especially since I went to Dongdaemun for my first shopping trip in Seoul. I didn't expect much on Myeongdong, but I was wrong. It was a shopping heaven. Everything is only 5000KRW (around 5USD) to 10,000KRW (around 10USD). All were cute. I didn;t spend a lot here, but I got so much stuffs :D"
1835,4.0,"If you are around Myeong Dong don't miss the fun of shopping This area is filled with ladies beauty products in the night it is very coloulrfull and crowded> What ever the climate don't miss the long ice cream cone (32 CM). This area is good for girls and beauty concerned people not for men, unless you are with someone. Forgot to tell this street is filled with food it is really delicious and mouth watering."
1836,4.0,"Myeongdong is simply a one stop shop for shopaholics. I say this because I was there to experience it last April 26, 2013. On one side, it has got the Lotte World which has the Lotte department store, the duty free shop and the Avenuel ( which houses the luxury brands ). On the opposite side, you would find the shopping street which has the different retail shops and boutiques and the mini street market where you find the small stalls. For me, it is a fusion of high end, mid range and low end rolled into one shopping experience."
1837,4.0,"You can shop for almost everything here. Most store have staffs who are able to converse in a foreign language e.g. English, Chinese and Japanese."
1838,3.0,"It is a great place for shopping but for those who prefer souvenir or special traditional Korean item, Insadong is better! TOTALLY DOMINATED BY cosmetic shop!"
1839,4.0,"Dominated by cosmetic stores, I think every cosmetic stores are repeated in every block. Be sure to ask for VAT refund if you made a large purchase. For a large person, do not bother to enter clothing or shoes store, as they will not have size available for you even worldwide branded stores, i.e., Nike or Adidas."
1840,3.0,"This is a central located shopping precinct.  Think lots and lots of small shops, plus mid brand range, H&M, Uniloq, Zara and the Koream shops..  I found it hard as a large male to fit into Korean shops clothes..the had great fashion and style .. Alas good for my wallet Lol...  This place is a shopping paradise for ladies... U name it the have it, cosmetics, shoes, dresses and accessories..  Shop ! Sop! Shop! But I found the Gangnam area better! It had great shops, tree lined amongst great cares, coffee n tea shops and restaurants.. Need another day in Seoul !,,"
1841,4.0,"If you're in need of treating yourself, myeongdong is the place to go! The are tons of high end clothing stores and delightful restaurants. As a foreigner living in Seoul, this was a great place to go for a little dose of home."
1842,4.0,Nice area to walk through. Lots of lights. Very lively with shopping in the stores as well as on the streets. There were many skin/cosmetic stores. Difficult to buy because I was not familiar with most of the Korean brands and most didn't speak english.
1843,5.0,"Myeongdong shopping can never be bored if you are shopping alone as there are many shops to entertain you, for example if you are looking for cheap cosmetic and certain brands in Myeongdong, you can easily find a shop of what you are looking for in any street that you go, especially for cosmetics!  There are also staffs in the cosmetic shops that can speak English, Chinese and Japanese too! Just keep a look out of badges on their shirt to see which languages can they speak, if not you may want to approach them and ask directly in your preferred language.  Also, if you prepared a list of cosmetic to purchase, show it to the staff and they will help you to find the products for purchase!"
1844,5.0,"You can find everything here. Who needs to shop elsewhere. Heaps of fashion, beauty, and food. Make sure you have cash in order to get discounts ( stores will not give discounts for card because they lose 10% to the card company. But if you pay cash, they will give you the 10% off, and maybe a little bit more depending on how good you are at bargaining).  I find the sales people at clothing stores to be extremely pushy which I don't like. But there is so much fashionable stuff here that you can put up with some attitude."
1845,4.0,the street are full with shop houses whether its branded or local things from skin care products to clothing...there are also food/snacks stall and restaurants. don't forget to bargain when you want to buy something. ^^
1846,4.0,"if you want to buy a branded items in Seoul, then Myeongdong its the right place, there was Grand Korea 2013 sale in winter time, don't miss it, you will get your favorit items in great discount"
1847,4.0,This area is likely to sell almost branded and expensive products. Not so many things you can bargain to buy it since almost all products are sell in the concrete building.What I can see are some stalls selling foods in the middle of walking street.
1848,5.0,Lots of stuff are available within the 1 place. CDs are cheap. Full of street snacks which offers a wide varieties of typical korean snacks.
1849,4.0,"this is definitely a tourist friendly location. Most the shops (cloth, accessories, cosmetics) people can speak multiple languages. They start in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese. This is to cater all the popular tourists destination. Also the fun fact is that cosmetics shops give up free samples at the door to lure people to step in to see their products. overall, you can spend a day here."
1850,5.0,"A good place to find everything proudly made in korea such as in house cosmetics, clothes and shoes. Branded retail is also found here like flagship stores of Zara, mango, uniqlo, H&M. You may get lost but it's easy to ask around or you will find a couple of tourist assist staff that are more than welcome to address your questions"
1851,4.0,Do you want to shop til you drop?...down dead on the ground only to get trappled? Well then this is the place for you! Just kidding. But this seriously is the place to find every and anything you are looking for! They even have 2 H&M's store within in walking distance of each other. There is also a famous noodle shop by one of the H&Ms if you excite from the mens department...I forget the name though :( There is so much to do here and so many restaurants and coffee shops to explore. You really need and entire day if you are a tourist. And this is a sweet spot for all the expats living in Korea!
1852,5.0,"You'll get great deals with cosmetics (Face Shop, Etude, Missha etc) All stores are always on sale. I always didn't notice that I've been shopping from morning till 11:00am... Lotte Department store is expensive though than their Duty Free Shops and other stores in Myeondong."
1853,3.0,Nothing much to see plus was too crowded. Definitely not the place to go during winter. We were too busy trying to hide in shops and cafes due to the cold. You can find most of the big name shops in any other cities as well.
1854,5.0,"We enjoyed shopping here and especially when you like skin care and cosmetic products because every where you look there will always a boutique for skin care and cosmetics,I was impress with the Korean ladies skin they are flawless. A lot of shops from clothes to super market, everything you need is here and the best part was the price was very cheap compare to my country.one day is not enough to walk all around the shops, I'm so in heaven. Theres a lot of restaurants and fast food too, the food is spicy but delicious and it's a reasonable price, especially Korean BBQ!!! If I have a chance to go back to Korea I will definitely go back here!"
1855,4.0,"Myeongdong comes alive at night with all the street food vendors lined up in the middle of the streets. Be sure to check them out! Cheap and delicious food. It's a cosmetic and skincare haven. You can find many Korean skincare brands and there is bound to be one at every alley. Other than the bigger main streets for more well-known international brands, go to the small alleys for some fashion by the Koreans! I didn't get to walk through the whole of Myeongdong, it's huge! Allocate more time for it when you're in Seoul!"
1856,5.0,"my friends and I loved Myeongdong! We visited the place everyday during our 12 day trip since it was just 5 mins away from our hotel. Even though it was sooo crowded and hectic, if you need to do cosmetic or accessories shopping, this is the place to be! There are also guides in red vests that help you if you have any questions as to where everything is or if you simply need to get a map from them. Myeongdong is HUGE, so it can get tiring, so multiple trips is a must if you need to complete your shopping. They also have tons of restaurants and coffee shops if you get hungry while shopping. So, if you're a shopaholic, this place is definitely for you...if you're not, it's still worth a visit during your trip!"
1857,4.0,"I dropped by in September, curiosity didn't kill me. I got free samples of masks including the one that has the snail's slime! Has yet to try it. And ended up buying some items here and there, then realized that they were so much cheaper than the same ones back home. Even if you're not into beauty products, which I wasn't, it's a good experience to see the numerous brand shops available in 1 area. Skin food, Etude, Nature Republic etc.., you'll not miss them, you'll see them anywhere. And there are hawkers selling cute socks, jackets etc..although I the socks were more expensive than the ones I got in the underground malls, they were still cheaper than back home. My daughters love them. Wish I had bought more."
1858,2.0,"Myeongdong was highly recommended. When I stepped into Myeongdong, I was impressed with the number of shops initially. But on closer inspection, I found it baffling to find the same brand a few meters away. So I made a hasty retreat for some place else that has a better shopping experience."
1859,4.0,"I spend like half month's salary there because there was a sale going on at that time. one piece of advice, bring more cash or make sure your credit card works :)"
1860,5.0,Myeongdong is excellent area for shopping for everything from clothes to cosmetics. They are also key international shops like H&M and Forever 21.
1861,5.0,"Abstract of shopping. You can buy everything you need from here. My recomendation is cosmetics, all brands are there. Ask them for freebies like samples."
1862,4.0,"oh the things to buy! plenty of skin care + cosmetics shops here. they're really quite aggressive with many shops having one sales person outside trying to lure customers into the shops with free gifts. whether you buy anything or not, you are allowed to keep the free gift. i ended up having more free gifts than the things i actually bought. hahaha... some of the boutiques sells reallllly cheap clothes as low as 5000won. i'm not sure why but i managed to buy some =p i stay at this area and i was here everyday of my stay. if i ever come back to seoul this is one place i definitely will not miss."
1863,5.0,"There's lots of shopping to do in Korea..from facial products to clothes, fashion accessories, bags etc. Prices might not be as cheap as Bangkok, but style and quality is on a different level."
1864,4.0,"This location is teaming with shoppers and salespersons who enticed customers by hailing them from the street. Things are inexpensive and good. The ladies would want to visit the fully-packed Etube House for their cosmetics!. They said Obdo is good, but I say this is better in terms of lower prices and variety of mixtures and concoctions to beautify the female bodies and faces. And they give freebies too!  Opposite Myeongdong is also another popular shopping street - Shinchon Ladies Street beside the higher end Shinsegae Shopping Centre. But here it looks like more Chinese-made goods are put on sale. Still it is much cheaper than those sold at Dongdaemun.  So if you ask me for a good place to shop. These three places can keep you here for two days, hehehe!"
1865,5.0,"if you want to buy korean fashion leave foot locker and so on behind, the local fashion brands are pretty great! sneak around the little alleys and stop by at the cathedral to calm down from all the shopping fuss. hilly seoul with lots of geen is walking distance!"
1866,5.0,Very good place for woman who love the cosmetics. Get the discount voucher from Korean Tourism sites. It's worth it. You need to spend at least half a day in this place.
1867,5.0,From cosmetic to fashion to snacks. The place I loved best in Seoul! Prices are really affordable and they usually come with loads of freebies. You can walk down the same street everyday with more and more things to buy as gifts or for own. Best deals for shopaholics!
1868,2.0,One of the busiest places to shop. Lots of people and noise. Not very good quality in most places. Not worth the money. Be careful of your wallet. Pick pockets.
1869,5.0,"You can basically get everything in one place ranging from street food, cosmetics, fashion, bags, shoes and entertainment"
1870,5.0,"I'd say walk here to 'see' what's 'IN' then buy at Doota & Migliore/ Erwha Women's University cos prices are slightly higher here. Note: Migliore here closed on Monday. Lots of great restaurants, just walk around and see where there 'ARE' patrons, you won't go wrong. Food: Great for Korean/ Korean barbecue/ Korean seafood, a few good ones here."
1871,5.0,"I have been to Seoul twice and insist on staying in Myeongdong for its central location, ease of access and great atmosphere. This holds for shopping too and Myeongdong is a shopping heaven. Whilst it has huge high-end shopping malls like Lotte and Young Lotte, it is really characterised by the hundreds and hundreds of street shops that flank narrow streets spanning a huge area. These shops are western and many brands are recognisable in the US and Europe. Goods are quality products at Korean prices (i.e. Significantly cheaper than the west but nowhere near Thailand prices). Only issue is you struggle to find large sizes as most are skewed towards smaller Korean sizes, especially for women.  In between the shopping you have restaurant upon restaurant, serving mostly Korean food but plenty of Italian food too. An infinate number of coffee shops and bakeries too. There are also Korean bangs (entertainment rooms) - tea bangs (my favourite), game bangs, dvd bangs to a few massage parlours (the massage parlours were way expensivo and not particular good). There are also two cinemas - one in Lotte and another in the street that have a late show starting at midnight. There is also the Myeongdong theatre definately worth checking out. I estimate that 90 percent of the people visiting Myeongdong are youngsters and this creates an exciting atmosphere. The place is absolutely jam packed every night of the week and weekend and every lunchtime during the working week.  For its enormous range in shopping, brilliant entertainment options and a buzzing atmosphere unlike any other I have experienced, Myeongdong is a fantastic shopping option worth international recognition in my opinion. Buckle up and enjoy the ride!"
1872,4.0,"if yyou go during the weekend or in the evening, the whole shopping street is full of shoppers, its have everthing from the low end to the high end things. You can find alot of cosmectics shops there. Dont forget to drop by the Hello kitty cafe...its cool"
1873,5.0,"I've been 3 times to Seoul, and Myeongdong is a compulsory place for me to go. Not just for shopping, also for people watching and I even get to meet the Korean actress Song Hye Gyo (from Full House fame) once there :-)) I stayed at a hotel just across Myeongdong, so I'll visit the place everyday :-P Many many many cosmetics retailers here, and the night market is also great. Haha, I just adore the place :-P It's a venue suitable for everyone, children, adults, mothers, aunties, just name it :-)"
1874,3.0,The customer services in the cosmetic stores are not as good when there are too many people. Be aware that some sales are very pushy.
1875,5.0,Cosmetics are cheap. Try the street food like the locals do. :) an awesome place!
1876,4.0,"Recommend going on a weekday. Weekends are incredibly crowded it will be hard to make your way through the streets. Also go during late afternoon-night. This is when all the street vendors set up shop. Tons of designer knock offs and cute accessories for cheap and street food. This area doesn't close until around 11pm and even on weekdays, it will still be crowded but it'll be a little easier to breathe than on a weekend. Try the giant yogurt softserve, it's delicious!"
1877,5.0,"Myeong dong is seriously a shopping paradise. You can find shops that sell cheap and nice stuffs! And there is also a shop named 'SPAO' which is advertise by super junior and snsd. When you are tired,you can also rest in some cafes nearby seling donuts and drinks. If you are a shopping mania, myeong dong will be the must visit place for you in seoul!"
1878,5.0,"Myeongdong is a 'must visit' place with endless shopping and dining experience.There are plenty of fashionable stuff for you to buy,nice restaurant for you to try on and catch the people's 'live and latest' fashion trend.There are mascots walking around giving out brochures and you can take pictures with them. I will definitely want to be there again because this place is a 'paradise'!"
1879,4.0,"Myeongdong is quite possibly my favourite placed to shop in Seoul. So many beauty shops like Laneige, Skinfood, The Face Shop, Innisfree etc...great for us ladies of love cosmetics! Service in most of the shops seems to be very friendly and efficient, although much of the staff speak limited English. There are also lots of clothes stores like Forever 21, H&M etc...and places to buy food and snacks, not to mention a few street stalls selling purses, sunglasses, bags, shirts so you can bargain with them. It's generally very busy most of the time but the atmosphere is good."
1880,4.0,"We were here on X-mas eve and it was jammed-pack that we could hardly move! At some point, I even thought that it was worst than Beijing subway during peak hour!! It's definitely a good place to shop and to eat. Found a nice sushi joint in the alley next to the Apple store. It was yummy and the price is reasonably cheap. It has post-it notes all over the wall and ceiling. Do try the street food vendors. Although one of our friends got stomach bug on the 2nd nite we were back there after eating the cinnamon cake from street food vendor. The others were all ok though..:-) You can find the same items that were sold by the street stalls in Dongdaemun with cheaper price."
1881,5.0,"Of all the areas I went to in Seoul, Myeongdong was my absolute favorite. The streets were just lined with so many shops and good restaurants. It was a great place to get some good deals on clothes and accessories. I especially enjoyed the department stores and live performances. There was just so much to do."
1882,5.0,"We stayed in Myeong-dong this Summer and were so happy that we did. It was so central for the subway and we even returned at the end of our trip as we didn't find a better area for shops, cafes, street food and entertainment in South Korea!"
1883,1.0,Literally nothing much left. Food is still buzzing but shopping and street vendors are really sad... Not worth coming anymore.
1884,4.0,"This is a very active and crowded street. Make sure to visit during late afternoons to the evenings as all manner of food, drinks, and anything under the sun (or moon) can be purchased here, several with a cheaper price range."
1885,5.0,Great shops with kpop merch and fun food stalls. A lot of fun socks available as well. Very nice underground shopping mall
1886,5.0,"This is the ""El Primo"" shopping area of Seoul. It is in the heart of the city and it is an absolute must to see if you are in Seoul."
1887,5.0,"When i visit Korea i always visit Myeongdong its cool. You have to visit it by day and by night. Good place for shopping, eating or for a coffee."
1888,4.0,"Myeongdong is one the best shopping destination in Seoul. Lot of local and international shops, cafes and restaurants. Love street food, worth to try:-)"
1889,5.0,"Great place for choice, yummy street food and ease of getting around. There are few well known brands from the west such as Zara, Levi’s, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Adidas and H&M for what we saw, could be more as it’s a big place, highly recommend a steakhouse in my other reviews."
1890,4.0,"The whole area was pretty cool, as there was something for everyone. In addition to all the restaurants and different types of stores (mostly make-up), at night they had a lot of food street vendors. More choices for women"
1891,5.0,Super awesome place! I really love everything from here . Would like to go back again here! Super worth it
1892,4.0,"Very touristy, but fun vibe! Lots of modern shops, market stalls and food stalls. Good variety of food as well. Must have, 30cm icecream!!"
1893,5.0,There's a lot of spot shopping in Seoul but this one is the best. Because they have good price. Low price but good quality. If you want some souvenir from Korea this is one place that you should come
1894,4.0,Things are more expensive in Myeongdong than other locations in Seoul.  There are definitely more tourist in Myeongdong . It is very central to everything . But very crowded in Christmas .
1895,5.0,"This was a great place to shop! We visited on a Sunday afternoon. Plenty of tourist friendly stores. Traditional and touristy gifts, food and candy. Definitely a must-do when visiting Seoul."
1896,4.0,"It is a perfect place for shopping of skin care, fashion items, etc. etc. Lots of people no matter it is weekend or weekday."
1897,5.0,"This is the place you have to visit if you are in Seoul. I went here almost every day whilst I was in Korea (for two weeks). There is so much here for everyone, in terms of beauty, music, niknaks, food etc. I would 100% recommend going here at night for the market, it is a once in a lifetime experience. The two best things I found in Myeongdong were - Nanta Theatre and Underground shopping centre.  The Nanta theatre was absolutely hilarious and can be loved by people of all ages. The underground shopping centre - found when going into the myeongdong subway station, was okay, there wasnt much there other than niknaks and socks, but there are a few kpop album shops there with such a large range of albums, all for very cheap. I'm from the UK and albums here (mainly bought through amazon) cost 4/5 times more than what I found here. I spent over £1000 on albums whilst here, and actually got my moneys worth, wheras in the UK this would have gotten me 30 albums at the most."
1898,5.0,Very interesting place to wonder around. So many shops and side streets full of shops. So many Korean beauty products and also Tom’s flavoured Almond shops. Also there is also a big Art box here as well. It gets busy during the day but that is nothing compared to nighttime when all the street food vendors come out. Please be careful because people will just push and shove when it’s really busy. That being said we still loved the place. Go and enjoy all it has to offer.
1899,5.0,"Night street of famous Myeongdong Street Night Foods, famous for its nightlife packs with people around. Had the lobsters baked cheese with read bean and Chocolate pancake that is so delicious and tasty. Is a night so lively not to be missed, environment and atmosphere is always so lively with bursting energy everywhere ☺️☺️☺️☺️.  Had teh lovely dinner over three street of night stalls around the Myeongdong Street walk. Lots of things to see and hang around the area."
1900,4.0,"As part of our tour itinerary, we visited the Myeongdong street for a couple of hours. There is a Lotte duty free mall nearby as well, though its more for branded goods. The Myeongdong street was packed with locals and tourists alike. Most of the shops are selling cosmetics, face masks, fashion accessories, and many streetside stalls with local food."
1901,5.0,Located just along the train station. This place boasts a lot of fashion shopping and food( both street food and restaurants). Really a haven for the foodies even in winter.
1902,5.0,2nd time here and I really love it here; bustling and full of energy.  Bought so much stuff here; really went crazy with the shopping 🤤
1903,5.0,"I loved the food street there. If you want to find Korean original Cosmetic you better going to Young Lottee shopping(DutyFree). The difference shopping etude product between Shaila duty free and MeyngDong is the number of things (package)and expired date ( pls check). Of Course the duty free is long than Myeongdong. The price can be diference betwen 3000 idr per item. Its all up to your decision.  I think 2.5 hours is not enough for first shopper like me. In the winter session, (-3 C) you must wear appropiate custom, since this is an outside area. And do not take more than 15 minute in the outside. visit a shop every 15 minute is the best to maintain your stamina.  There are alot of the same shop, so be careful if you make an appointment. be more specific on the location.  Take Care and have Fun.. happy shopping...  Korea have a lot type of Cosmetic, pls brows and learn first about the product that you are looking for before it. its save your time.  The Food there is amazing. I tried grill Lobster with Mozarela, expensive but worthed. Eggbread is safe for muslim. ignore the fried ""type"". Korean street Seller are friendly but good sales person(They wont give up until you buy :).)"
1904,4.0,"I am not much into shopping, but you can see scores of people going on a shopping spree there. Try to go in the evening, there are lots of eateries and a very long food street with lots of choices. Food street is not that cheap though, it can cost you KRW 15,000-20,000 per person if you try 4 or 5 types of food."
1905,5.0,"Wife and I only had two days in South Korea, so we had to be very selective in the things we wanted to see/do. Tripadvisor pointed me to this destination so we decided to give it a shot. I honestly cannot tell you how much I ate that night, but I can tell you it was a near endless supply of food for hours.  The stalls on the streets are just knockoffs, but somewhat entertaining to look at and the brick and mortar's offer a wide variety of items to purchase (cosmetics, shoes, dollar stores, etc)  If you only have a few days in South Korea, I recommend stopping by and filling your stomach for a few hours. Bring a lot of Won!"
1906,4.0,"Amazing energy in this city. The crowd just continues to bustle up to 11pm with street food vendors and ‘face mask pushers’ in a backdrop of visual stimulus of bright neon lights and aesthetic display of modern shops.  Great exposure and almost like a smorgasbord of Korean food in bite size quantity peppered at every corner. I would highly recommend trying the street food, it could certainly be good enough to make a meal out of it!"
1907,4.0,"Quite a shoppers delight mostly for young women. This shopping area features are Korean skin care and cosmetics products. Many of the cosmetic shops offer samples in addition to 50% or more discount for purchases if bought in quantity. You can also have duty free purchases over a certain amount spent. It is also a great area for fashion clothing,shoes and accessories. In the evening this area has so much neon signage that it is almost blinding. As in any shopping area in Seoul there is a great quantity of food stalls and also different cafes and eateries. Quite a challenge trying to maneuver amongst the throngs of shoppers."
1908,5.0,"I was hosted in a hotel in this area for 12 days. Really enjoyed the street food, easy access to subway, convenience stores, banks, and diversified commerce."
1909,5.0,"Sure, you can go during the day but at night this place truly comes alive, especially on weekends. About 3 blocks square, the food stalls congregate along one strip and it is on this strip that we spent most of our time as we are foodies. From live octopus to egg cake, fruit smoothies to scallops in large seashells, the choices are endless and a veritable taste sensation. Prices are reasonable to a tad pricey for what you get but where else can you have so much selection in such a condensed space.  We also had a Korean massage for a reasonable price but it is a dry massage through towels and a hospital-like gown; more of a pressure point session than a true massage... a bit of a disappointment.  The stores offer packaged almonds, dragon's beard candy, ice cream, face and beauty products, and numerous tourist trinkets. But really, it is all the neon and energy and liveliness in the crowds that make this place work. An hour will do or stay the whole evening; it's totally up to you. Also, as it is downtown it is walkable from anywhere in the tourist area and certainly a short walk to a bus or metro stop. Definitely go; one of our highlights. 5 stars."
1910,5.0,"Myeongdong is a must visit when in Seoul, no doubt about it. Not too far from some of the major sights and palaces of Seoul, this area is defined by its street food stalls and alleys full of branded shops. The streets are packed with tourists and locals alike, plenty of delicious food all over, whether in street stalls or in cafes and restaurants. Lots of beauty/cosmetic stores, fashion and the works. Just a great area to get lost in and absorb Seoul."

1913,4.0,"Fun place to wander around at night and stock up on k-beauty supplies. Shop employees will be handing out “free” sheet masks in exchange for ushering you into the stores and trying to make a sale, so be prepared lol. This place gets packed after dark w/ tourists and locals alike. Tons of delicious restaurants and street food to choose from, so come hungry."

1918,4.0,"The first thing we saw stepping out of the taxi is the KoreaMart. We then proceeded to shop for unique Korean snacks, Maxim coffee, chocopie, all kinds of face masks, as pasalubong.  We also tried the streetfood of sausage&tekkbokki, fish cake on a stick. We were too full to try the rocket potato and seafood.  We also shopped at Innisfree. There are a lot of make-up stores here.  There are also many ""tiangge""style sellers of clothes, coats, socks, trinkets, etc.  A must place to visit ecen if you are looking to shop."

A place where you can shop, observe people.  A lot tourist you can see here with various style of seller and customer. A largest Uniqlo in seoul and 11 levels of dyson also available here.I stay here for 7 nights and what i can say this place is very crowded and happening. Not suitable for anyone who want to relax and quiet place but for shopping its really awesome.No word can describe :)"
1922,4.0,"The place was swarming with tourists and locals alike, but the dizzying scene was compensated by the delicious street foods and a plethora of shopping options. Then again, food prices were too pricy. Anyway, if you're in for your first experience in Seoul, this area should be one of your first destinations!  Also, there is a tourist information center just near Myeongdong Catheral where you can ask for directions of money exchange shops, luggage coin lockers and the like. The guides directing us were really friendly and willing to help."
1923,5.0,"Shop and dine in Myeongdong whenever you find yourself in Seoul. They have everything and more! So many great restaurants, street food could be a bit pricey but the ambience and the fun vibe covers for it all. You will also find hundreds of cosmetics and souvenir shops. Cafes and bingsu shops are tops too!"
1924,5.0,"Very alive and vibrant area, for me a good place to explore when in Seoul and it’s best to go there late in the afternoon and in the evening when food stalls are lining in the streets with different varieties of street food. One of the special thing to visit in this area is the dog cafe and cat cafe. It is also a good place to shop for cosmetics and souvenirs, etc."
1925,4.0,"This area is a must for travellers to visit. If you are into Labels you will find them all here. Also street food, cafes and coffee shops. Also a pretty impressive cathedral for those interested in such."

1928,5.0,"Every major city in Asia has a shopping area and combined with food stalls. Seoul has one and this place is crazy, especially in the evening hours. While the shop keepers try to lure you in to buying cosmetics, streets are lined with food stalls from either side with plenty of options, reasonably priced and decent quality. If you are a vegetarian, you will have limited choice but to see the spectacle, you must visit"
1929,4.0,"It's a best street shop for food and drink and sweet ,, cofe The street have a shops and both they sell every thing You can spend 5 ,6 hours"
1930,5.0,"Visited at night when the shopping street becomes a night market after a plethora of booths, almost all selling street food, are set up in the middle of the road.  Because the streets containing the market are wide, there is plenty of room to walk comfortably, without claustrophobia, having to push or being pushed. This gives Myeongdong night market an advantage over every other night market I’ve visited in Asia.  A further plus is the amazing variety of foodstuffs offered. As opposed to other similar markets in Asia you don’t have three, four, or ten merchants offering exactly the same food.  For those who like street food and/or night markets Myeongdong night market is very highly recommended."
1931,5.0,"My daughter and I stayed at a hotel right in the center of Myeongdong and proved to be the most convenient! If you are looking for anything For skin care.... this is absolutely the place. Do your research about Korean beauty products, there are a million brands ... it is quite overwhelming .... store after store offer beauty products. Also there are lots of clothing stores, restaurants, coffee shops and much much more. The stores close a little later at night so its a very fun street to walk day or night. On Sundays, all the street food and bargain stalls set up in the middle of the streets making it much more fun even... it was nice to walk around the take a taste of the different kinds of street food. This street is a must see when in Seoul ."
1932,5.0,"I ate here most nights. Great location to just stroll and eat. Can get crowded, but that is also part of the charm. Must visit when in Seoul."

1936,4.0,"Lots of food and items to buy for yourself or souvenirs. I recommend you to buy almonds, cosmetics and clothes if you come here. Dont bother about the restaurants because you will want to try all the street food stalls. The food stalls is not good as Japanese or Taiwanese stalls but they are good nonetheless."
1937,4.0,A place to buy the lastest and most trendiest lines of cosmetic product. Great place to buy cosmetics souvenir for your love ones.
1938,5.0,"Many many shops, skin care stores, cat cafes, street food and more. Definitely recommend as a tourist experience."
1939,4.0,"A lot of skincare shops along the shopping street, with lots of streetfoods to check out the place well and for you to shop.  Myeongdong is located at Line 4. Easy to find with Subway app and Rome2rio app locator.  My second time in Myeongdong street and its better to travel with your friends and family! But at your own risk since its very crowded and you might get lost. Be sure to know your meet up points in case you are lost.  Be careful also to the sales person who pulls you to buy their product. Be alert!"
1940,4.0,"Myeongdong Shopping District is a must-see if you're travelling to Seoul. I would recommend spending an entire evening walking around and exploing the area while tasting some street food! There is a big choice among typical stuff and very un-healthy desserts. As for shops and resturants there is a wide choice, almost everything is typical from Korea!"
1941,5.0,Shopping street bustling with tourists and locals alike. Worth a visit... or 2... street food was expensive and had nothing to shout about though
1942,4.0,Cannot move on with the shops and boutiques.hahaHaha I feel good and happy there.will come again later ehh
1943,4.0,"Skincare, cosmestics, stationeries, phone accessories as well as some trendy clothings. Most shops offer immediate tax refund, if not, you can try to locate kiosks to do so. You can save more if you buy in bulk with lots of free gifts offered. Tired of shopping? There are many casual eateries and even street food at night."
1944,5.0,"So for sometime now I have been using various Korean beauty products. Needless to say when I finally booked my holiday to South Korea, I immediately did my research where to buy beauty products. The place to head to is Myeongdong district which contains a grid of streets brimming with shops selling beauty products. Seriously, I was in heaven.  I also found that if you spend over £30,000 won most of the shops would immediately deduct the tax free amount so no need to claim it separately. Take your passport with you.  Also, when you buy stuff from these shops most of them give you freebies ... I loved it. A must visit for anyone who is a beauty junkie like me."
1945,3.0,"Initially walked around at mid-day and it was deadsville. Lots of shops and restaurants that could be found in multiple other locations. Happened to come back in the early evening and was shocked by the amount of people walking around, the lights and the energy. Don’t regret going but still didn’t feel it was particularly special."
1946,5.0,"This is a long and small road that has formed a market. Inexpressible by the excitement of this market. This is a street market so it is very fun and too much items. If you are a food lover, this is the street with the most junk food, the price of food is not expensive, only about 10.000won. Besides, this is also a place selling many cosmetics and fashion clothes. From famous fashion brands to ordinary types. The neighboring countries in Asia also see this market as a precursor and create fashion trends for Asia. If you come to this market to shop, you should prepare personal trolleys because there are so many goods here, you will save health and spend more time to shop, enjoy delicious food."
1947,5.0,"Fun, bustling area with plenty of places to shop , people watch and eat. Great Korean restaurants and street food options are plenty and delicious."
1948,4.0,"This is where to come to get the street food in Seoul - there is loads of it available in the evenings. There's also a lot of high street fashion brands, including the Korean affordable brand 8 seconds. Recommend visiting the Myeongdong cathedral at the same time."
1949,4.0,"A busy areas of stalls down the main side streets of Myeongdong. There is a lot of tat stalls but within there is traditional korean stalls. The variety of food on offer is excellent but beware if stalls don't display a price - always ask first, as prone to overcharge tourists."
1950,4.0,"Seoul is plenty of shopping centers, markets,.... but Myeongdong is the top:a jungle of shops, restaurants, bars, hotels,... that will meet your expectations. If shopping is a boring activity, acoording to me, avoid this place."
1951,4.0,Shopping street good also for street food: a lot of choices and a lot of restaurant around. You should find also what you are looking for. Nice place where to walk for your shopping.
1952,5.0,"Our Myeongdong street experience is one part of our “fantastically memorable “ Seoul trip. This is a must see experience. We enjoyed the food vendors here and you’ll see how the place is well patronized by people of different culture. The vendors are so kind in receiving tourists who were there to join the fun!! It’s so exhilarating to be there even just to be a spectator😋 the place is easily reached by train, and there are so many things to do and of course buy!"
1953,3.0,"Plenty of shops in this area of Seoul and they appear to stay open all night as well. Busy area with lots of local restaurants, street food and national and international chain stores selling mostly clothing, make up and other fashion products. Be prepared to be walking very slowly as it is likely that the crowds in this area will make it impossible to get anywhere fast. Not my kind of shopping area with all the international stores but a good place to visit anyway."
1954,3.0,"Non-shoppers may want to stop by just to see the scene or grab some delicious street food. Myeong-Dong is super busy from about mid-morning until late at night. Really, there is something for everyone however, mostly geared toward those interested in shopping. Skin care products are all the rage and are all over the place here - from high end to bargain buys, there are clothes in all sizes, and more food options than you could imagine. Street foods (anything on a stick), the sweet and savory egg bread, my personal favorite Delimanjoo (pricy at exit 4 of the metro, they put on a bit of a show too), and higher end restaurants where you can sit for a nice meal. Go with patience and empty hands (i.e. - don't bring your luggage). Definitely not a 'local market' experience however, good for some gifts to send home and people watching."
1955,5.0,"I really like Myeongdong night market. Its so alive and people of all ages come here, so it's not just tourists. Its a great place for street food and souvenir socks which retail at W10,000 for 11. I'd definitely cone back again."
1956,4.0,Massive shopping area with side by side cosmetics and fashion stores making for easy price comparisons. And food stalls that come out at sunset make for a wonderful street food experience.
1957,3.0,"This market was interesting,but I found Namdaemun fascinating.If I could only visit one of the two,it would be Namdaemun."
1958,5.0,You can never get enough of Myeongdong shopping street if you are a woman who likes yummy street food and make-up. All the Korean brands are there and the prices are cheaper than in my country.
1959,5.0,"Crowded place. But good to come. Many halal street foods too... if you love skincare products, you should go to this place. I took taxi from hotel near Anguk Station, with just 4000 won... cheap enough."
1960,4.0,"This was our stop before lunch. This shopping district was very not too crowded and we freely walked from vendors stalls to shops without any rush. Some of us were even braved enough to sample free coffee and teas. We purchased some of our first souvenirs and clothing in this shopping area. Prices were reasonable and you can bargain. We had limited time and were only able to explore one end of the shopping area before meeting with our guide for lunch. If I go back I would certainly add more time here. Again, impressively clean. I was too busy to remember to take pics."
1961,5.0,"🎋♨️✈️ Myeongdong- A Cosmetic Paradise A cosmetic haven. One can buy, buy and then buy some more and then perhaps come another day to buy few more... and folks that is Myeongdong Market for you. It’s a cosmetic aficionado’s or enthusiast’s paradise.There is a vast potpourri or omnium gatherum of popular Korean cosmetic brands. You could choose or collect all from HOLIKA HOLIKA to Innisfree and Etude House to Tony Moly and MISSHA. The list is never ending. When you feel like taking a break you could pick a fruit glass or choose from an array of grills from the vendors in the middle of the road. Once replenished, you could start all over again. So shop till you drop."
1962,5.0,"Skin care stores are all over and you will see their chains on the next block. So don't worry about finding one particular location. Some products irritated my skin and I don't have sensitive skin so test before you buy. We went on a Monday, after 4pm, you will see food stalls on the street. Must try the food!!! They have grilled seafood like lobster tails. There are also restaurants nearby, one inside a mall and they are good too. Underground shopping center for souvenirs is great - items are negotiable. If you need another luggage you can also get it here for all the stuff you buy. Right next to subway line 2 and 3 too."
1963,4.0,"At night, all the stores shine in neon. Every Korean cosmetics company has at least one store here. Also has the honey butter almonds shop. Many street food innovations that I haven't seen before. Not quite cheap, though."
1964,4.0,"Myeongdong street is a shopping heaven, both for food, goods, and beauty products. It is clean and not rowdy, making it a safe place to roam around even at night. You have to try the street foods, they taste really yummy and cheaper than eating at a sit-down restaurant. You can have a good fill of delicious food just walking around while shopping. Beauty products are sold at stores left and right. You cannot go wrong as Korean beauty products are top of the line. It would be a mistake to come home without atleast buying one beauty product. As far as buying replicated goods on the street, it is not advisable to haggle down on the price as every vendor sells pretty much similar items in the same price. Don’t embarass yourself as they will just dismiss you or worse, you may end up being laughed at or given the dirty look."
1965,5.0,"If you want to shop this is the place. We only went for a browse, but you could find anything you needed here."
1966,5.0,A few connected streets suitable for walking and full of shops. Great for shopping clothes and beauty products. The street vendors selling food were all very delicious too.
1967,5.0,Myeong-dong market ist so busy. You can buy a lot of stuff you dont really need but also try food you never tried befoe. Seoul has a lot of diffrent types of markets. Check it out !!
1968,4.0,"Quite an experience + better if you are not set on buying stuff. Interesting street food. Well, since you WILL buy things, they are selling good-priced suitcases as well (Guess, why I know!)"
1969,4.0,This is a perfect area to spend your time. A lot of shops from street food to brand name products. Prices are also very competitive. There are also many restaurants that one is spoiled for choice.
1970,4.0,"One of the best place where to go in the night. Is the paradise of korean street food, you can try whatever you want: everything seems delicious (but not exactly cheap) ! There are also many shops, especially beauty shops (as in all cities in Korea), even if they all sell the same things, less or more. Here you can buy sweaters or t-shirts at a cheap price! Unmissable!"
1971,5.0,"Crazy shopping district, particularly nice at night with all the lights on and the street food vendors."
1972,4.0,"There's no doubt that Myeongdong has been so developed that it feels touristic and commercialized. Lots of visitors from all countries at any time of the day. Most interesting things to do here is to:  1. Shop 2. Shop some more 3. Shop till you drop  From cosmetics, Korean groceries, apparels, shoes, etc - you're bound to find something that would interest you. Along the way, there are some pretty good cafe and restaurants. For first timer's to Seoul, I'd recommend staying around this area."
1973,5.0,"My hotel was literally up the street from this place and boy did I go all 3 nights I was in Seoul. All the beauty products you may want or not want, they have. All the street foods you want to eat, they have. It’s busy, loud but thats the fun part of it. Visitors and locals in one place = organized chaos."
1974,5.0,"This is an excellent market, which has a range of stall selling a variety of food, from kebabs, dumplings, pancakes to tempra shrimps and Gimbi. At night the market gets very busy."
1975,3.0,"Myeongdong is good for shopping and for food. It is less crowded during the week. On weekends and at night, it's packed."
1976,4.0,"I’m not fond of crowds and crazy shoppers; so Myeongdong’s beauty shopping mecca doesn’t really spell paradise for me. The only thing that draws me back would be its hardworking purveyors who spend their nights feeding hungry bellies, no matter the weather.  It’s important to note that Myeongdong’s street food are darn expensive. It’s something that definitely won’t fall under cheap eats; as you’ll usually be able to eat a hearty meal in a sit-down restaurant for the price of one or two of these street food finds.  There will never be a shortage of options in Myeongdong Night Market. The tricky part is though is how to strategize what to choose, given that you usually have to allot for queuing time and work with a limited budget and stomach. The Roast Lobster with Cheese (KRW 15000), for example, is an insanely indulgent treat, which serves grilled juicy lobster topped with a fluffy melted cheese blanket. It’s delicious, but it definitely won’t fill you up.  Baked seafood served with hot gooey melted cheese seems to be a popular trend (given that we arrived at the tail-end of its winter season), as kiosks of Cheese Butter Baked Scallops also drew in their own lines. The scallops were humongous; but tended to be overcooked.  The Shrimp King’s Grilled Shrimp (KRW6000) may be an uninspired choice compared to its flashier neighbors; but its perfectly cooked juicy shrimps were addicting. Its sweetness guarantees the freshness of the shrimps and makes them perfectly delicious to eat on their own. They do give you a variety of sauces and dips to play around with though!"
1977,4.0,Great place just to wonder around and get lost while shopping. These streets are lined with many shops and cafes. Don't go too early as a lot of places don't open until afternoon. And note that most restaurants close around 8 or 9 but you can find a few open 24hrs
1978,4.0,"Bombarded with masks shops and endless food shops. The night market sells stuff on skewers mostly 4000-5000 won. Too tempting as they smell good. Desserts like ice cream including rose ice cream, cat cafe and witch cafe. Just need to be careful as after spending 30,000 alone won still hungry as they are just tiny stuff"
1979,5.0,"Best street for food and shopping, u will find alot of delicious food in the street which u can grape and eat while u r shopping. Such as shrimps, fish icecream, lobster, egg sandwich... and alot more. This street is full of beauty shops. Mostly makeup and face masks."
1980,3.0,"I recommend to come here once and only once. Come to get your currency exchange. They have the cheapest rates. While you do it, by all your skincare products and eat some street food!"
1981,4.0,"When in Seoul, one won’t miss to visit the Myeongdong shopping streets. At night fall, the streets are lined up with hawkers offering all kinds of mouth watering local delicacies. Brace yourself for the authentic Korean flavours."
1982,4.0,"I went here thrice during my stay - twice during the day and once at night. If you want serious shopping for Korean makeup and skin care, go during the day when the street is not filled with food carts. At night, it can be hard to navigate in and out of stores as the crowd and get quite thick. The stores and stalls in Myeongdong sell all sorts of trinkets, clothes, bags, shoes, socks (a LOT of them) drinks and delicacies, including lobster tails!. There is a cat cafe and a dog cafe - I only went to the cat cafe and I enjoyed it! A must-go to even if you are not a Korean make-up fan."
1983,5.0,"There's all your usual shops down here from JD sports to Nike to cosmetic shops. Additionally there are tonnes of good eateries including my personal favourite BBQ joint in town. There will be tonnes of people, but it's not like it's tourists, it's 95 percent locals. Bring comfy walking shoes and water as the SK humidity is no joke and there's several hills in the area. There are good food places legit at every corner so just take some time to explore."
1984,4.0,"So many shops and currency exchange places. Look for the currency exchange shops that are further into the shopping area. You get a better rate. For example, I used the first one I saw right by the main entrance and got 1160 per US Dollar. Further in another stall was offering 1170 per US Dollar. Is a difference if you exchange a larger amount of USC. Also so many shopping, eating, desert, food places to enjoy. We loved walking around here."
1985,5.0,"I haven't been back to korea since I moved to United States 40 years ago. I was so looking forward to the visit and ir didn't disappoint. Myeongdong street was one of the places I visited and it was one of the best places I visited, second only to namdaemon market. Picked up a few gifts for friends back at the state. Anyway it was very pleasant experience."
1986,3.0,"This was a great area to shop. But as I went down many different streets, I saw the same shops. Stores like H&M that are anywhere, and local stores over and over. How many do you need in one area? Still, it has a nice feel if you just want to shop. I was looking for something specific and became overwhelmed by street after street of the same thing."
1987,5.0,"We stayed for 5 days in Loisir Hotel (just a few steps away from shopping street), almost every day we would go here, and we can't seem to find the end of this street. I would personally explore more but since my parents' stamina is not exactly the best, moreover we brought our 20 months old niece with strollers... well you can imagine.  Beware tho that this shopping street is not where the cheap stuff is. Cheap stuff goes to Namdaemun Market nearby. But if you want to experience the crowd, and want to know what's the hype all about, brace yourself for an ocean of people, smoky aroma form the food stalls, and not so clean streets. But hey, that's what we all want to experience, right? Because despite all that, we would totally go back and explore more of this infamous street."
1988,5.0,"Crowded, but whatever you want to buy in Korea from food to make up to clothes can be bought here, lots of restaurants and also street food stalls open a bit later on. Must visit if in Seoul"
1989,4.0,Great place for cosmetics and popular clothing stores. Street Food also repeats and is ok. Fun cafes for coffee and desserts. And lots of bbq places.
1990,5.0,"Visited around 4pm on Saturday. Absolutely nuts - stalls everywhere, shoppers everywhere, food carts serving huge variety of street food. Just amazing to wander through the chaos and take in the scenes. Lots of cheap goods if you are looking for souvenirs from Seoul. Plan for at least an hour to wander, more if you want to eat."
1991,4.0,This place has many shopping malls. It has big department storw for who looking for elengant one. Even for young people. There are many alleys with non brands shops but quite well catch fashion people's intention. Many other cosmetetic shops as well. You can easily lost your way if you are keep walking. Please keep in mind there are a lot of turists and people who is calling you. If you want to visit quite and peaceful place this place is not for you. If you are looking for busy and comnercial area this is for you.
1992,5.0,"Really like the shopping here, good for cosmetics and laddies clothes! Street food at night was fun to try, come with empty stomach! Be careful of people pulling you into the stores and restaurant no eye contact with them to avoid that! Goodluck"
1993,4.0,"As my hotel is in Myeongdong, I walked past this area regularly. There are the usual malls, shops and restaurants. As expected in Korea, there are many cosmetic and accessories shops targeting the ladies. Not to miss are the food streets. Suggest you visit in the evening to experience the atmosphere and buzz here."
1994,5.0,"Perfect place, so much shopping fun. Lots of free samples, and all kids of beauty products souvenirs street foods. The best"
1995,4.0,"This place is just perfect for street photography especially after an evening rainshower. Other than that, there are a lot of flagship stores where you can just shop until you drop."
1996,5.0,"Octopus grilled - 8000 KRW Fish cake : 3000 Face masks - but 1 get 2 free (at 10000 KRW)  Experience - priceless. What a lively street, id rate it very high on street food, but if you like the food experience you have to go to Gwangjang market"
1997,4.0,There are lots of foods to taste and shops are everywhere. You can start shopping at around 5:00 p.m. until midnight.
1998,3.0,"If you are under 35 or shopping for someone who is, this is a 5-star shopping street. If over 35 or shopping for someone who is, go elsewhere. Noisy, crowded, oh-so-young-trendy . . ."
1999,4.0,"What more do you need, lots of shopping, lots of restaurant, plenty of beverage shops, just make sure you bring some comfortable shoes."
2000,5.0,"Myeongdong is a wonderful district to visit with Endless shops and eateries.  Lotte, Shinsegae, underground and above ground shopping streets are all in this district. Many good restaurants on Myeongdong ga-gil waiting for you to explore as well occasionally some street stalls along your way can quench your thirsty or hunger.  Myeongdong station is not the correct station for Lotte Duty Free or Lotte Department Store. Don't be misled by the advertisement in the station. Take the Euljiro-1ga Station is much closer.  Use Myeongdong Station exit 6 will bring you right in the heart of Myeongdong shopping streets.  Here is the best place to buy Korea Snacks back home. On Myeongdong 8ga and passing Myeongdong 2-gil but before the main road Sogong-ro, you will find Lotte Mart at your left. The famous Wangjigib BBQ is also here. Lunch special up to 5 pm only 11,000 to 13,000 won.  However, Lotte Mart is not the cheapest for Lotte Products. You can check Korea Mart and other shops along Myeongdong 8ga-gil. Promotions of Korea Snacks are plentiful here and sure will cause you over weight.  Whilst you already reached Lotte Mart, mind as well go across Sogong-ro to Shinsegae Duty free and Department store.  Since you are on Sogong-ro, at the fork, take Namdaemun-ro North to Lotte Young Plaza and further to Lotte Duty Free and Department Store.

The side alleys off the Main Street offers many local Korean brands ranging from boutiques, cosmetics, consumer goods, digital equipment etc.  This is a area where you see a young Korea in action. The biggest plus point is that the stalls are open till late."
2008,4.0,Many stalls set up on this pedestrian street food zone that is actually a UNESCO site. They serve just about everything on a stick including the tornado potato which originated here. It's crazy crowded and crazy fun for awhile until the tummy is full anyway. I am not into the shopping however and blew that whole thing off. Many high end stores have made shopping one of the main tourist attractions here.
2009,5.0,"I totally love this place. It is busy yet you have so much to see. You can find souvenirs, clothes, korean fashion stuffs, food, convenient stores, massage parlour, cosmetics and beauty products stores. Its best to come early (before 1pm) if you want to avoid crowd and the heat. I prefer coming over at night, probably after 630pm, where you have lots of street stalls selling more merchandise and lots of food stuffs. The beauty shops such as Innisfree, Nature Republic and Olive Young is worth a visit as they might have special offers especially if you buy more. This is a long street with many directions to walk about. Just take note of certain stores as landmark for your easy reference. There are some brands which has more than one outlet at the same area. It can get quite crowded at times so pace yourself. A mini usb fan will be helpful... I would recommend this as a must visit especially if you are into shopping, cosmetics and beauty, street food, fashion stuffs and souvenirs."

Subway station also just near the area easy to travel to other locations.  Bus station to airport also available in walking distance from nearby hotel.  Overall, a good area in Seoul."
2013,4.0,"This is the main shopping area in Seoul. If you want to get away from the high end pricey department stores, then you can come here. There are the brand shops but there are cheap stuff to buy as well."
2014,5.0,"This is a long stretch of street market where you can find streetfood everywhere from seafood, meat, chips, strawberries, grilled food, etc. There are lots of skin care shops from Nature Republic, Missha, Tony Moly, Etude, etc and lots for shops for clothes, shoe and some souvenir items. The skin care shops offered lots of freebies and the prices are way cheaper as compared to prices of the same brand in shops here in the Philippines. If you dont like streetfood, there are also lots of restaurant. Good to try this place. We went here for 2 nights."

Souvenirs, specialty shops, beauty products, Music Korea, Innisfree, etc. etc. you name it. What really sets this place off is during the late afternoons to evening when the food carts come in to give you a taste of Korean street foods. You can choose from a wide variety of preparation which is distinctly Korean. This truly should not be missed by anyone travelling to Seoul."
2017,5.0,"Some of the sellers are a bit sweet/pushy for you to buy their merchandise, but nothing rude....they have a lot to offer. I did make a mistake and bought a letter opener, thank goodness they allowed it on the plane. It wasn't expensive so it would not of been a money loss just a souvenir loss. :-)"

Mainly for fashion, lifestyle and beauty. There are many cafes, restaurants too. The most interesting attraction might be the very propular one on instagram : Stylenanda Hotel, so named but actually not a ""hotel"" to stay, but a shop selling cosmetics, fashion clothing with a cafe, all housed in several storeys designed like a hotel and spa. The design concept dominated in pink color is interesting enough to attract younger crowd to go in and browsing around, taking photos and selfies for their instagram posts. At night the whole street is turning into a night market, with food stalls selling all kinds of food, snacks and souvenirs."

2029,4.0,"I felt this area was a kind of hybrid between the older style markets and modern shopping malls. It was primarily pedestrian access (but make no mistake, watch out for small trucks and motorcycles) and at times was very busy. Lots of food vendors of all types of street foods and most were very cheap. I had shrimp, crabs, and strawberries and all were good. The stores were more conventional brand names and there were a lot of them. It seemed popular for the younger crowd. When i went there were numerous tourism representatives eager to help. My overall impression was that it was very safe and friendly. Great place to try the street eats and maybe scope out a bargain."

2032,3.0,The street food is great. There's a lot of places to shop especially if you're in to K-Beauty. However I would skip this place if I don't have time. Myeongdong isn't that unique - there's plenty of shopping districts like this all over the world. Most of the shops are targeted for Chinese costumers and it's always overcrowded. If you like the atmosphere I recommend Insadong or Hongdae instead.

For Malaysia n Muslim lookibg fir halal food there is a Malaysian restaurant naned Restaurant Kamoungku. The menu is delightful and at quite a reasonable price.

2045,3.0,Hearing a lot of people said a cheep place to buy street food and souvenir...not at all the street food here & stuff were 2x more expensive than other major road street food. It's very crowded and noisy not suitable for big adults. My advise never to greedy of this free mask sample given out if not planing going to buy it. There will gives you sample if you are truly brought from them and sometimes u can asked extra another few more sample free from the counter (it depend shops).

Would I come again? DEFINITELY."
2051,5.0,"Myeongdong is absolutely batshit, and in the best way. It's crowded and lively, with a bewildering selection of shops, cafes, and restaurants. There's underground shopping as well as street-level, but don't forget to look up: most commercial buildings in Seoul have shops on the second, third, even fourth floor. If you're looking for skincare, nearly every top Korean chain has multiple stores here. You'll find Western fast food, international restaurants, Korean BBQ and dumpling places. Anything you could possibly want to eat is somewhere in Myeongdong. Some of the best K-pop music stores are here, as well. Plus a big movie theatre. You could spend days here and not see everything. When you need a break, sit and relax a while in a tea cafe. And then, as evening comes along, start all over again, because at night, the broad main streets become packed with vendors selling souvenirs, gadgets, and every conceivable kind of street food you've ever heard of. Fair warning: a lot of it can be greasy and messy, and there are very few trash cans. But most vendors will take your discarded napkins and skewers and dispose of them for you when you buy your next treat from them. And it helps to have extra napkins and perhaps hand wipes handy. The digital screens and neon everywhere are dazzling, and people-watching is delightful. Have fun!"
2052,5.0,"You can find almost whatever you're looking for in these streets as well as Shingsae department store. Everything from street food to, socks, t-shirts, electronics, supermarkets, desserts, restaurants, etc. Stroll worth the trip."

2056,4.0,"This place is for food enthusiast and shoppers. Nice place to shop whilst eating korean specialty crayfish, or an octupus on a stick... lol. We spend around $50 the first nyt and we keep craving for more stuff.. following night we ate at the resto. Kinda busy atmosphere on the street at night. Worth an experience..."
2057,4.0,"As per title, myeongdong street is popular with thousands of fashion line, food,kpop goods and many more.

2110,5.0,Love the street food stalls at night though they are not necessarily cheap. There are plenty of skincare & cosmetics ships offering discount. The only watch out is not to be touted and be sure to buy only what you need. The shops will try to throw in all kinds of deals & freebies to encourage you to buy more. There are also many nice restaurants offering a lot of dining options. Great place to hang out at night. There is a street for having Chimac ( Korean fried chicken & beer).
2111,4.0,Myeongdong literally 'bright cave' or 'bright tunnel' but it is really nothing like a cave or tunnel but it is bright all right. Bright all night with the wonderful aroma of street food and great shops for good bargains for all things under the sun.
2112,5.0,"This shopping street is one of the crowded or busy street in South Korea. Famous for its local cosmetic product where you can get a very cheap price and good offer. They also sell cheap brand of shoes like Fila,Sketchers and a lot more branded product"

2114,4.0,"Lots of stores both bright and pokey to gander at. We only had a short time, I had to get back to return the Hanbok that I had rented. I bought a few things here and the prices were affordable and reasonable. The smaller pokey places had better prices than the bright . Also some great street food and people were super nice, though that could be because I was an older blondie in a Hanbok."
2115,5.0,"I have 3 daughters, 1 son, 1 wife. My wife bought all those masks... masks for ever single part of your body that you can imagine!!! My 2 teenage daughters did the same this and then all four of them bought clothes, blouses, pants, skirts, jackets... a lot!!! Me and my son enjoyed tasting all the street foods that start opening up at 5pm. Delicious!"
2116,5.0,"You can get all your traditional korean food and snacks here. Rows of make-up and skincare products boutiques. They have big supermarket there too, where you can buy local snacks souvenirs. If you want proper restaurants, they have it there too."
2117,5.0,"Great street market that is located steps away from downtown Seoul. There is so much here that it’s hard to sum it all up.  Face masks? You will get “pushed” face masks by almost every shop. Actually gets annoying after a while, but heck...we bought 100 face masks. Our faces better be silky smooth :)  So much food options! You’ll have a great time trying the different vendors or restaurants in Myeongdong. We tried tons of different places and all were very tasty...not one bad experience.  This is for sure an experience you won’t want to miss! Happy travels!"
2118,5.0,This area become street food many small stands sell food and other things At night the lights are beautiful at day hours you can visit the shops
2119,5.0,"Myeongdong is an area which becomes lively full of shopping goods and foods at night. There is also a famous church there, the myeongdong cathedral. This place cant be missed when you visit south korea."
2120,5.0,"Our accommodation was just a walking distance to Myeongdong shopping market wherein every night we go there to eat a lot of street local food, branded items on sale and choose to a variety of skin products. Prices were really affordable and if you shop a lot you, tax refund at the airport is possible."
2121,5.0,The Myeongdong shopping area is an open air mall with hundreds of small food merchants in the sidewalk - every kind of imaginable food - very reasonably priced - instead of a meal at a restaurant I enjoy eating a bunch of different small portions from a variety of merchants - delightful
2122,5.0,We took a few hours out to walk the district. Thete is a wide variety of great street food to enjoy and many and varied shopping outlets too. There was a throng of tourists from all over the world this night. We thoroughly enjoyed our time and highly recommend this activity.
2123,5.0,"Myeongdong is fun, have your wits about you, tourists galore, enticing street food and markets sellars, lots of beauty shops. love it !"
2124,3.0,"Area is huge. Alleys Cross to each other packed with clothes, food, jewellers etc. This place is kind of must to see f you haven't visit an any other Asia countries outdoor market. One thing catch my eyes, there is also quite many shops for photographers. If you find yourself in Seoul, visit there. It's kind of experience."
2125,5.0,"As an MCM avid fan, Seoul is a must visit, and it's flagship store in myeongdong comprised of 2 floors which will make a fan like me go crazy! As for all d popular skincare brands e.g. innisfree,face shop,saem,etude house n etc, u can find some good bargains for d sale items. All of d best thing here is? Lots of freebies to take home!"
2126,4.0,"Some similar shops around all selling cosmetics and shoes. The night market have many interesting food. I love to get earrings there, they are super cheap and beautiful."
2127,4.0,"There are numerous interesting shops and good restaurants. It is a wonderful place for you to try the local food and buy something special. Also, If you are a street photographer, you will find it worthy of a visit."
2128,5.0,"We came here during the evening after walking down from the Namsan Tower.  The market becomes super lively during the evening with lots of food stalls (similar to those found in Taiwan).  The Koreans love their weird and wacky food market items, You'll find something for everyone. If you get a chance - try the mini octopi and the dumplings!  Here you will also find lots of 'discount' snack food shops. They are all basically priced the same along the street and all sell the same things. However we did notice later on some of the snacks were being sold at cheaper prices in just a regular supermarket so they might actually be tourist traps! Though - you really can't fault them for their variety!  Lots of options for dinner in the area too if you want a sit down meal and also really close to the Lotte mall!"
2129,4.0,"Walked around Myeongdong every night because the carts with street food were excellent. It was great to explore the different foods. When we were tired of street food, there were a lot of restaurants to cater to our needs."
2130,4.0,"Very close to the Myeongdong Cathedral there is this bunch of streets full of shops restaurants and street food stalls. This neighbourhood is beautiful and you may want to visit this few times while you are in town. The place is very crowded at every hour of the day and night. You will be surrounded by smells and flavours while walking along the main streets as well as noise and people from shops inviting you in. Street food is very cheap and typical Korean, l noticed quite a lot of difference between one stall or the other therefore pay attention to details when you pick one and eat there. Personally speaking l could not miss to stare at the frying oil as most of them have been frying stuff for the entire day and it is dark and smelly and unhealthy but that is everywhere and not only in Myeongdong after all. Perfect for shopping and great place to buy some little gifts from Seoul."
2131,5.0,Great place to try different Korean style street foods. Such a lively location with several sneaker and cosmetic stores. Have also tried a few nearby restaurants.
2132,4.0,"Visited Myeongdong street food a few time during my family holiday in Seoul in Dec 2018. The street food is very delicious and also expensive. There are many varieties and among all my favourites are the sweet potatoes, grilled prawns with butter, grilled shredded cuttle fish and the fried potato chip. Myeongdong Shopping Street is the best, their sneakers and sport attires are up to date."
2133,3.0,"I guess it is cool to see and visit this shopping street, but do not expect to actually find anything. There is a lot of nothing and actual stores that seems to be legit sells counterfeit goods for original prices, so be aware."
2134,4.0,"Bustling, lots to see and buy. The street food is good and worth trying. You can snack along the way instead of dinner. There are plenty of shops: cosmetics, clothes, shoes etc, as well as plenty of outdoor stalls with gifts, clothes...."
2135,5.0,Shopping + food haven. You can literally find everything and anything here. We spent a good 2 days shopping and exploring the different restaurants and cafes.
2136,5.0,"This place is all about shopping fashion items clothes, shoes and of course korean beauty items. Street food is also every where. Just have cash handy atms and currency exchange is a bit of a walk from the street but still accessible."
2137,5.0,"We stayed in the heart of Myeongdong in Dec 18 and it was so convenient for shopping and trying different local food! We could actually run between different shops to compare prices, and return another day to make the actual purchase. Street food was fun to try as snacks for the first 2 days, but after that we had enough of them. Plenty of choices for proper sit down meals all around .. from BBQ, porridge, stews, etc ... just google the ""must try"" lists, read reviews and start work down from there."
2138,5.0,Lots of shops for every taste and wallet. Nice street food at the end in the evenings. Highly recommend!
2139,4.0,"Well known area when it comes to korean beauty products. Hence, you will also find some apparel shops, mini mart, street food and restaurant, hotel and some souvenir items."
2140,5.0,"Can't think of what to give as a souvenier? Myeongdong is the place for you. It has everything - shoes, clothes, food, accessories, etc. Shop til you drop. Shopping haven especially for girls who likes Korean beuty products. If you go here make sure you bring plenty of cash. A must try also would be the street foods every night."
2141,4.0,"A vibrant, busy and tourist friendly area in Seoul. Easy to get to by the metro. Lots of eateries and shops. Multiple Starbucks in a small area :-) Lots of street food which is my favourite I must say. Very friendly people."
2142,4.0,"...though there are loads of other shops below street level (at the underground sections within Myeongdong station) and at the upper levels of each building. It’s easy to get distracted by the shopfront and promoters at street level who try to entice you with free samples to enter their premises. But learn to look up and check out the store signs where you will discover book stores, CD shops, non branded clothes shops, restaurants and even a meerkat cafe (yes, you heard me right....a cafe where there are real meerkats that come up close to you).  The street resembles the hustle and bustle of streets in Asia except that you can feel a really young vibe here very much like Shinjuku in Tokyo. Loads of cosmetic brands (Tony Moly, Etude House, Innisfree....etc) each one trying to outsell each other by offering discounts or specials. Not surprising to see two outlets from the same brand just 100metres apart.  This is also the place to get your K-pop merchandise fix where street carts and shops within Myeongdong station peddle all sorts of paraphernalia from key chains to posters to mugs sporting your favourite Korean pop idol.  If you need to get stuff for family and friends (or even trendy clothes for your teen), this is the place to be with major shopping centres (Lotte, Shinsegae Department Stores).  If you are in Korea during the winter/spring period, you will get to enjoy the Korean strawberries which are a real treat. Just don’t get them from the street carts along Myeongdong....You would probably get a better deal (almost half price) at Dongdaemun Market which is just a stop away on the Korean metro line."
2143,4.0,Walking through Myeondong shopping street will not only whet your appetite for shopping but will also stimulate all your senses. There’s so much going on! There are shops everywhere and also vendors in the streets. It can be easily an overwhelming place but can also be a fun place to visit.
2144,5.0,"If you’re into cosmetics and beauty products, you have to go to this place and you won’t probably finish the whole area in just one night. Too many shops offering different prices of the same product. Sellers offering freebies for you to enter their shops. You can find good deals when shops are on sale but that means you really have to spend time going into each store. So far the most common stores I saw in literally every street are, aritaum, skinfood, artbox, too cool for school, innisfree, clio, nature republic, banila co., and tony molly. I’m sure I miss a lot but really with that many cosmetic shops, I’m lucky I can still remember a few!😂 There are also good street food but not a lot.  Myeongdong is very accessible, there’s an MRT that goes straight into the market. If you know how to find your way through Seoul’s MRT then it’s really easy to find places in Seoul. I’m so used to taking MRT here in Taiwan so Seoul was no problem for me.  I would recommend anyone visiting Seoul to visit Myeongdong just to experience the cosmetic culture of Korea."
2145,4.0,"Never get bored to visit multiple times Good to try street foods, not really reasonable price... wandering as many shops as possible before you make purchases. Different prices at different shops..."
2146,3.0,"The whole area is just a shopper's pure delight and haven! Everywhere you turn, every nook and corner, every building you enter, every lane you go to, it's nothing but shops, shops and more shops... the place never sleep, I think.....it's literally ""shop till you drop""...."
2147,5.0,"There are many people everyday at Myeongdong Shopping street but on weekends, people flock the shopping area for freebies and discounts. I bought so many buy 1 take 1 masks ad make up on a Saturday! The street has full of activities - shopping, street food eating and light show (Christmas season). It may really get cold during winter however... A must see when in Seoul!"
2148,4.0,"Myeongdong comes alive from 4pm to 10pm with the various food and clothing stalls. It’s worth a visit. You get to see all sorts of food items being sold as well as clothes, toys, shoes, etc."
2149,5.0,"We got off namsan tower and went to myungdong. the weather was very cold. We came here for decades, wanted to have warm meal. but we could not find a restaurant. we finally met the staff who showed we the place and fund the restaurant location. there was a restaurant in the nearby alley. we warmed body because we ate warm sullung-tang. myung-dong is still the center of seoul."
2150,4.0,Myeongdong Shopping Street is a nice place where you can find trendy goods. We bought some pairs of shoes which my daughter only found here. Also the street foods is a nice experience since they offer delicious and tasty food but be careful they are not cheap!!!You might over indulge in here!!!
2151,5.0,Don’t go to this place if you’re in a budget cause there are so many delicious food that you need to try and so many shops!!
2152,5.0,"While there are plenty of places to shop up and down the street, I came here for the food, and I was not disappointed! Even on a cold night (-10C), there were plenty of people lining the streets trying out all the street food vendors. I did a walk to scout out the place first and selected a few places here and there to try out, and wasn't disappointed in any of them. They even had an Oreo Churro cart that I skipped out on, but the hot food really hit the spot on a cold night.  Don't know much Korean but was able to communicate with finger pointing and numbers in English (or calculators), which got the job done.  Would definitely come back to this place, maybe next time not in the winter though. =D"
2153,4.0,"This is a shopping haven for sure for those who love shopping! I may not just have explored the entire place but the stores closed earlier than I expected (around 10pm). I thought they would be open as late as 2am or so. So keep that in mind if you planned on shopping pretty late at night!  I also noticed the prices are a bit expensive here - that's why it was called one of the most expensive shopping districts in the world! So definitely check the other areas in Seoul if you plan to do a lot of shopping because other places like Dongdaemun, Ehwa and Hongdae were a little cheaper!"
2154,4.0,Make sure to wear comfortable shoes if you head to Myeongdong. Tip: many of the beauty stores tend to give out face masks for simply browsing in the stores.
2155,4.0,"Myeongdong shopping street is nice for buying cosmetics, but I would not recommend going here during the weekends. It's very crowded. The street food here is also very nice."
2156,4.0,"You will love when you first visit here, cosmetics, clothing and food are spread out in every corner like an area that is partying, there is always a reason to remember this place"
2157,5.0,"Many, many boutique shops for everyone. I particularly recommend the traditional caligraphy brush shop, the bag shop with unbelievably low prices, the jade jewellery shop, and the sugar sweets demonstration that you'll never forget, along with the taste that you'll savour forever!"
2158,5.0,"Visiting Myeongdong Shopping Street in December is a nightmare, as it is heavily visited both by locals and tourists. It is difficult to really take in the sights and enjoy the experience, and you have to do the best you can.  It does seem like a fabulous Street though and would not discourage anybody from visiting. Just be smart about it.  The Street Food is good and a good variety. Worth visiting for just the street food. But there is plenty of shopping and bargain hunting to be done.  My favorite was the Uniqlo Store and the Lotte Dept Store close by. Almost a full day allocation."
2159,5.0,Amazing world full of small wendors who are offering great street food. Get lost inside this beautiful place and try all the food!
2160,5.0,For a first time visitor to South Korea this is a must. We enjoyed the smells and flavours. It’s true immersion in the local cuisine and culture and very affordable. just a few minutes from city hall station. Don’t miss out
2161,4.0,"Loved this area, buzzing at night Street food was lovely, ranging from $5 upwards for a portion, The beauty stores here make you feel pressured to buy, staff walk around with you like they are stalking you, they keep going on about buying this and that, and buying in bulk like spending $60 for face masks! I hated shopping here, much preferred Gangnam area , same shops but calmer and easier to buy."
2162,4.0,"This is a must visit for all visitors and tourists in Seoul. Honestly I don't understand why many people visited this place for products, food and souvenirs. Despite there are many street foods areas in MyeongDong, please be sure that they are all selling the same types of Korean foods. That's why I am confused what is the attractions in MyeongDong."
2163,5.0,A heaven for ladies to shop! Wide range of beauty products and clothing for ladies and men. This is a shopping heaven!
2164,5.0,All the Korean beauty names (or at least a few) like TonyMoly - Laneige - Etude House - the SAEM - Innisfree - Missha - and plenty more!
2165,3.0,"I heard from some of my local friends that the prices here is actually pretty higher than other places. It’s always full of people and tourists whether you visited it at day or night, weekdays or weekends."
2166,5.0,A lot of stalls selling different types of things... Usually your partner will spent a few mins in every stores....leaving you outside waiting for her or you can join her....A lot of variety to choose..
2167,5.0,"Any traveller coming here for the 1st time should visit this place and spend money, that's my kindly advice, you could buy premium cosmetics with acceptable price!"
2168,4.0,We went there for street food and local items. Very good and reasonably priced. Never go to that Lotte Duty Free mall as it is a nightmare and expensive quoted in USD only. But street market is ideal to visit for all classes
2169,3.0,This is crazy..whole street is packed of fashion and skincare shops. U can get any korean brand here. Very crowded. A lot street food but korean doesnt sell cheap street food like other countries have.
2170,4.0,"I think good place to shop for Korea cosmetics & eat street foods. Must eat the mochi red bean strawberries, chicken skewers, grilled scallops & baked cheese lobsters, grilled beef steak, etc"
2171,5.0,myeongdong shopping street is truly heaven on earth for people who love shopping. spent the whole day here and still want more!!
2172,5.0,"I would list in my must-go place. The area has lots of cosmetic shops, clothings, discount food marts and plenty of street food. I came here a tad early at 12 plus in the afternoon. Most of the street vendors hadn’t set up their stalls. The advantage was that a much smaller crowd in popular shops such as the Line Bear; where there’s a giant one-half storey tall bear available for free photo taking. This area also has cat cafe and a good selection of restaurants, coffee cafes. By 4pm, the area was filled with people and most of the streets stall are out in full force.  The atmosphere is very different from Hongik University street which is also worthy of a visit!"
2173,5.0,"You can find anything here, from Korean cosmetics to international clothing chains. But what makes it so fun and special, are all the streetfood stalls that crowd the streets from 3 Pm onwards. Bacon wrapped veggies, fishcakes, shrimpshrewers and chocolate dipped strawberries. It does get crowded so we had to watch our 6&4 yo closely."
2174,5.0,This place is the heart of Seoul for us. Shops closes late till 10 pm so after our land tour we can still shop and eat street foods which Myeongdong offers a lot. That’s why I always choose hotel right here in Myeongdong.
2175,3.0,Many varieties of retail outlets and and good food outlets after a tiring shopping. The retail assistant gives good service too.
2176,5.0,the items like the clothes are very nice and a lot of sale. would love to come back again and shop more items
2177,4.0,"Tonnes of shops for indoor shopping and sales ongoing. Also what makes the place buzzing are the rows of stalls outside selling street food, clothing, etc."
2178,4.0,"The area was rife with shopping and food and ranged from household names such as Daiso to a huge North Face store. There were sports shops at nearly every turn eg JD sports, Adidas, Nike etc to small stores that sold SGD 1 pair of socks. There are arty stationery shops, massage and nail spas, confectionery stores and lots of shops selling face products from oatmeal face masks to brightening face masks.  What was fascinating was the vibrant night life. The area came to life at night with food stores selling butter garlic scallops, beef balls, twisted potato chips, fried pancakes and waffles etc. The list and selection of foods boggled the mind. You just could not eat enough and there was so much interesting foods to try and sample. It was admittedly a little steep in price but it really depended on whether you ordered a chicken fried corn sausage or a buttered lobster.  Really worth a visit."
2179,5.0,"If you enjoy a crowded street market type atmosphere with lots to see, hear and taste, then you should enjoy this area. Lots of stores and stalls, the area is a bit of a maze that you can wander around. Stall prices are ok but not the best (example, Dongdaemon’s Migliore have generally better pricing). Easily accessible by Myeongdong Station."
2180,4.0,"If you would like to pick up different type of cosmetic products, this is one stop for all. Do note that the push cart on the streets are retailing more expensive than the underground stalls. You can also pick up a map so that its easy to move around. Can spend easily half a day here."
2181,5.0,"Must visit if you love Korean skincare products. They are selling it so much cheaper here, I especially love their facial masks. Less than half the price compared my home country. Good brands such as Laneige, AHC, Iope, Sulwashoo and many many more. Definitely will be back here if I am visiting Seoul again."
2182,5.0,This is the best place on earth which you can eat and shop from morning till night. This is mainly for tourists so the price are slightly higher. But they have everything you need there. 1 stop place if you only have 1 day in Seoul.
2183,5.0,We stayed at The Grand Hotel Myeongdong and loved the festive atmosphere right outside the hotel. The shopping and street food were amazing!
2184,5.0,"The Myeongdong Shopping Street, and all the associated side streets and lane-ways, is a great way to spend at LEAST a couple of hours just walking around this primarily pedestrian shopping area. There is so much to see, well-know (and not so well-known) shops to browse, and a plethora of restaurants, and street food vendors. I just love to sample street food wherever I visit, and I just loved being able to sample some of the very tasty and generally inexpensive street food that was on offer in this shopping precinct.  While it is referred to as a shopping street (implying that it is a single street..) it is actually an entire area of primarily pedestrian streets that all seem to ""hang off"" what is generally accepted as the main ""shopping street"".  A visit to Seoul is definitely not complete unless you have spent at least a couple of hours wandering around this area. Fortunately for my partner and I, our hotel was only about 10-12 minutes walk away, and so we passed through this area on a number of occasions, and enjoyed the experience every time... daytime OR night-time. Thoroughly recommended."
2185,5.0,"Stayed near Myeongdong due to food street and underground/street shopping.  A must visit place for tourist and it’s so crowded due to Xmas/festive season.  Plenty of money changers around so in case you need to TOP up more Korean wons.  Lots of cosmetics, shoes and snacks to buy!  Line friend and Kakao are there too"
2186,5.0,Alot of cosmetic products are avaliable at affordable prices here ! not to mention the numerous dining options avaliable. A great place to visit if you want to buy everything under one roof.
2187,5.0,A must visit if you come to Seoul. Abundance of street food & also Korean skincare products. I was in heaven! 😂
2188,5.0,"I love the place. Crowded and busy but beautiful. I love all the bargain products. Easy to talk to the staffs. I also love the street foods and especially the dessert, icecream! We love going during night time."
2189,3.0,"When I was in Seoul for the business visit, I checked with the local people about places to visit for the shopping, this name was taken by every one. Yes, the place deserve. If you are having sufficient time and you want to enjoy the shopping specially clothes, shoes and anything, you will enjoy this place.  Thanks"
2190,4.0,"Great place to shop during winter. Many choices for teenagers on clothing and make up and skin care.  At night many street food line up for hungry shopper.  But there is lack of toilet nearby for shoppers to use. Also some skincare shop pressured you to buy, i find it annoying."
2191,4.0,"Many food stall along the way. Recomended food and lots of variations too. Do please try the egg bread, pork bbq satay, japchae, strawberry coated with mochi, bungeopang, and many more. You could find souveniers too here. They also sell socks, t shirts, and cosmetics. Recomended night market."
2192,4.0,"Worth a visit for the street food and shopping options. There's a huge Zara, H&M, Uniqlo and MCM store, along with multiple branches of k beauty stores, offering discounts and duty free shopping."
2193,3.0,"Maybe it is only because I am a guy but this shopping area was nothing special for me. During the day time it is a bit more leisurely but at night the streets become much more narrow because of the food vendors and it seems busier. I did find that there are multiple shops from the same company located in this center which kind of confused me but what the heck,....I am a guy. I also found out that there was no haggling over prices there. You don't like the price, goes elsewhere. Street food vendors were ok but a bit pricey. Had grilled lobster from one of them that ran around 15,000 won which is between $13 to $15 US. But what the heck is cheese on it for???? I would rather have had butter!"
2194,4.0,It’s a tourist destination. Lots of street vendors. Food and stuff. Mainly tourists but a good place to soak in the culture and atmosphere.  We sent the kids to the arcade while the adults shopped. Arcade’s great. Payable by the hour with some free games for young children. Lots of virtual reality stuff.
2195,5.0,"This place amazed for how the crowd can have enough of everything from shopping to enjoying the sumptous streetfood. There a line of street food vendors in every corner of the street selling japchae,ttbeokki , stir fried chicken, galbi, pancakes, seafood skewers, egg muffin and a lot more.We keep ong visiting every night for the duration of our stay to make sure we tried most of it but our time wasn't enough."
2196,5.0,Lots of shopping and Food streets with many stalls. lots of tourists and locals. Can find almost everything there. Open till 10+ and absolutely loved if
2197,5.0,"I spent so much money there .. the street food in the evening was amazing and the shops came alive at night, it was like two different places during the day it's a normal town .. a fair few people going about their day. . And night/evening it becomes a hustle and bustling place with thousands descending on the streets, it was amazing to be there while the Christmas lights were lit. Truely is a have to be there to understand the two different faces of seoul. Without a doubt I'm going back very soon"
2198,4.0,"Years has past since my last visit in 2014 & before that but Myeongdong still remain a great attraction, great shopping street & a local food street at nite, full of tourists full of noise full of ambience...  Like best still the food stalls at nite, u will definitely find something nice. Tried quite a few - Korean fish cake, grill prawn, fruit juice, chestnut, Gimbap etc lots of varieties. It's freezing in Dec so the food stalls really warm up your tummy!  Great to stay near Myeongdong, so convenient to subway, airport shuttle bus stop, bakery for breakfast, restaurants, departmemt store (run out of time to revisit) ....  & Rolling Pin, found this nice bakery near to exit 5 or 6 of Euljiro 1 station on way to hotel, it's quietly at a corner. We had our breakfast there every morning after we found it, the bread is so nice, great coffee & ambience!  If u have limited time in Seoul & want to experience nite shopping street with local food stalls, Myeongdong is the place!"
2199,4.0,"This place appears to be a “must visit”. There are many stores here selling clothing, etc. There are also many eateries and street food in the evening. The place is so vibrant and crowded with both locals and tourists. Well worth a visit if you are in Seoul."
2200,4.0,"I would recommend visiting this street towards the evening when the streets get closed to vehicular traffic and instead get lined up with apparel, accessories, souvenir shops and food stalls serving myriad Korean dishes from seafood to sugary savoury delights.  For those of you who want to haggle on prices, good luck with that since the shopkeepers here have a union of sorts where they don't charge any less than the price marked. To that end, the prices here are already very competitive and hence bargaining isn't really needed. For those of you who would still love to bargain, should head to the nearby Myeong-dong Underground Shopping center where the shopkeepers are more willing for some bargaining.  Expert Tip: For beating harsh Seoul winter weather, going Underground will be a much more comfortable stroll in the endless matrix of alleys."
2201,4.0,I kind of live the night market because they have a lot of local food at one place... its easy to find halal food too if you walk and looking up the shop lot coz most of the restaurant is at second or third floor. But the price is a little bit pricy. Maybe this street full with tourist. There also a lot of branded boutique...
2202,5.0,"Our hotel was just at the end of the Myeongdong shopping street, which was PERFECT for a nightly stroll through all the stalls and snacking. Every night we selected our favorite delicious Korean treats for a late-night snack.  Favorite Snacks: * Korean pancake with honey and cinnamon inside..mmmm... * Kimchee dumplings * Lobster (Pricey at USD$15, but so worth it!) * Shrimp and butter....yum * Egg on bread (bread was more like cornbread. simple snack) * Spiral potatoes  If you like congee, you've got to try the Congee House at the end of the street (31 Myeongdong 8ga-gil, Chungmuro 2(i)-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul,) The abalone congee is to die for! We ordered the ""take out"" and it was packaged so well."
2203,5.0,"If you wanna try Korean style street foods, visit here. Clean and interesting. Also, bunch of fast fashion brands is here."
2204,5.0,"You can get everything here. Food, souvenir, beauty product even friends. It's a must go places you should go when you visit Seoul. Try the street food. Some are quite expensive but it's a once in a lifetime try."
2205,5.0,"I stay at Moons Hostel, 8 minutes to Myeongdong shopping area. here you can eat halal food at the street and restaurant named Busan and kampungku (Malaysian Rest). Beauty products everywhere cheap and many mask gifts if you buy. And also socks with many designs with 1000won. If you can't find places you can ask Tourist person there. At Ishadong sell key chain, magnet and handmade bags inside and outside the building. Please buy wood spoons and others made from original wood and beautiful. At Namdaemon market sell brooch, shirts with comfortable price but I think closed 5.30. Please book on line to Nami Island and Everland, it's cheap. Beautiful area for family and couple."
2206,4.0,"Cosmetics valley.Foods be it street foods, restaurants or just a cafe's. Looking for Korean Seaweed, they have KMart."
2207,4.0,"The place is great for shopping. Big discounts are offered by various merchants. Street foods are delicious, but a little bit expensive. If it is your first time to Myeongdong, make sure that you bring a map with you. Same business establishments appear in different streets. There is no public toilet with in the area. You have to enter in a coffee shop or dine just to use their toilet. Definitely this will cost you."
2208,5.0,"Walking along Myeong-dong Street, the first thing we would notice is the food stalls selling mouthwatering street food. We went there on a weekend and there were lots of people. But, as a family with kids (we were even using a stroller), we were able to maneuver easily.  We tried almost all the food they sold. And they all tasted good! Just for you to have an ideo of how much the food are, here are the food prices i remember: takoyaki with baby octopus is 5,000 won, vegetable omelette is 3,000 won, lobster with cheese is 15,000 won, and their soft serve ice cream is 2,000 won . Most food are priced at 3,000 won to 6,000 won each. The lobster is expectedly expensive.  There are cosmetic shops at the side of the street. Some of them give free face masks to entice you to check out their shop and buy from them.  There are also stalls selling coats, souvenirs, socks, gloves, etc."
2209,5.0,"Myeong to the Dong! Wow! The single word that could describe this place - wow. From the signage on the road which marks the entrance of the shopping area I was already trapped in its ambiance. I've read and watched a lot of blogs and vlogs about Myeongdong before coming to Korea. So seeing it in actual is really something. Street foods lined both sides of the road along with different stalls of souvenir items, shoes, socks, chestnuts and all sort of things. Shopping buildings and restaurants are also everywhere. It seems like a never ending stretch because it extends horizontally and vertically. I really loved shopping for souvenirs there because its cheap! Also the selection of food is really nice from hotteok to gyeranpang to odeng. Along with friend chicken with tteok etc.It's truly a heaven for foodies and shoppers. Great place to visit!"
2210,4.0,"Very crowded during day or night. Many store selling cosmetics and beauty products. Street foods are more expensive compare to Hongdae, dongdaemun and namdaemun. Overall a very good experience to spend sometime here."
2211,5.0,Quite a huge shopping street. Just grab anything you like because the street vendors are just selling the same thing. Only extra precaution as street is super crowded
2212,4.0,"I heard a lot about Myeongdong before my trip, not knowing what to expect until I visied the place for the first time. Lots of shops, especially skin care products. The pricing is cheaper than my country. Must buy facial masks, very cheap. This place turns alive in the evening when the people pushes out the street cart and it becomes food street. Tasted a few, not bad but not fantastic. Good for experience but I won't eat again. It is a tourist place."
2213,4.0,"Korea is known for their sheet masks and skin care products, that are part of the famous Korean 10-step skin care program. You can find all major brands here and then some - including Innisfree, Etude House, TonyMoly, etc.  Try to visit the Line Friends store with the famous photo opportunity with their giant bear. There is also a muti-story Daiso (kind of like a Korean dollar store, but not everything is a ""dollar"") and Lotte Store (department store).  Definitely try the street food for some fun food options.  Korea is also known for their character socks (like super hero socks, Snoopy, Mickey Mouse, etc.) that are sold for about $1-3 USD (or about 1,000-3,000 Korean won).  This a good place to wander around for a half or full day. Also a good place for some Korean souvenirs."
2214,4.0,Myeongdong is a very busy area. Good place to eat and shop. It’s very crowded but it’s worth a trip.
2215,5.0,"A buzz of activity - with loads of food stalls, shops and restaurants. Also seemingly more organised than Taipei’s night markets and better spaced out - ie you still have some personal space. Depending on what you are looking for this could either be a treasure trove of noises/smells/shopping/people watching or it could be boring. I dare say that if it’s the latter you wouldn’t be minded to venture to this district. I would hesitate to call it a shopping street as that sort of implies a single street - it’s not - It’s a sizeable shopping district."
2216,3.0,"Even though it's a long street, the shops are repeated so essentially it's just a really short stretch of shops. Mostly beauty and make up products. Their main targets seem to be Chinese tourists, and they sell things in bulk (e.g. 80 face mask sheets). Some decent street food."
2217,5.0,"Myeong-dong is Seoul’s shopping mecca and is a must-see for tourists, but it is not just a shopping destination; Myeong-dong is also a hub of commerce, banking and culture with a daytime population of 1.5-2 million. For shoppers there is a mixture of street stalls and retail outlets selling everything from high fashion to casual attire, as well as many Korean cosmetics stores offering high-quality products at competitive prices. Myeong-dong is very popular with international visitors and fills with Japanese and Chinese tourists during the holiday period known as “Golden Week” which takes place in spring and is called golden week due to the week-long holiday period that takes place in Japan and China. Part of Myeong-dong’s popularity stems from relatively affordable prices here, especially compared to the other shopping meccas of Apgujeong-dong and Cheongdam-dong."
2218,5.0,"Firstly the underground station Myeongdong houses a huge shopping mall. The area is filled with a huge assortment of food shops, shops selling clothes, cosmetics and to numerous things to list. Great street food and the whole area just buzzes with excitement. Restaurants and entertainment are plentiful. A must on your list of places to see."
2219,5.0,Everthing you need is at Myeongdong... I was staying at Hotel Price which just across the street. I suggest you spend at least 2 trip there( I went Myeongdong for 3 night straight) as the 1st Trip...check price before buy...next trip buy all you can carry.
2220,5.0,"Place full of cosmetic products. Every corner, the same brand, street food is all around. Great to walk around even one is not buying."
2221,3.0,It is safe with easy access by train or cab.Lots of shops selling the famous Korean masks.Stick with the brand Innisfree.Lot of food carts around. Not so good for vegetarians.Spoken English is limited.Good bars too.
2222,4.0,"This place offers various stores. A lot of beauty shops most especially. Offers a variety of street food! My fave part, just wish there were trash cans cuz so many people would leave there trash. So many people, if you're claustrophobic and you just hate crowds, not a place for you. But if you love shopping and food, definitely worth it! Lots of cafes to getaway from the crowd from time to time when shopping."
2223,3.0,"The streetfood is definitely overpriced. And the stalls are repeated, so you see different people selling similar food items in the whole stretch. With the amount of money we spent on streetfood, we could have had a decent meal in a proper restaurant."
2224,4.0,Myeongdong is not just a shopping area for beauty products but known for its street food. We taste various street food at pricey amount. Some store give free face mask but others if you dnt purchase any in their store they will get again the face mask
2225,3.0,this place is noisy and busy and colourful at night. Hawkers set up portable carts on the pedestrianized street. Lots of street snacks but prices are ridiculous. 6500W for a juiced promegranate! 25000W for a pack of strawberries.
2226,5.0,"Definitely an active shopping experience, not for agorophobics. Shops of all kinds and sizes are side by side on narrow streets with colorful sings and throngs of people. Clothes, cosmetics, knick knacks, food, brand names and unknown brands are on display."
2227,5.0,"Myeongdong shopping street is fun, lively and bursting with energy. There are all kinds of shops, department stores and restaurants. There is also a great variety of street food. Several of the local cosmetic shops offer a free sample face mask if you come into the store and browse. There are free concerts sometimes. I happened to see two very different but good concerts on two separate occasions."
2228,4.0,"This is the biggest shopping district in South Korea. Things are not that cheap so think twice before buying.  Easily accessible, lots of street food and restaurants too."
2229,3.0,"First of all, I know it’d be crowded cause it’s a tourist area, which isn’t the issue. The problem I had mainly was the entire shopping street was just the same stores over and over again spread out. Like 6 Tony Moly, Etude House, Clio, etc makeup brands store just scattered throughout the street. So it’s not like the entire street is different, it’s like the same stores. Kind of overrated."
2230,4.0,"It's a place that everyone comes to when visiting Seoul. Long and parralel streets of hawker food and clothes for shopping. Many shopping malls around, too. Its very crowded with tourists, both locals and abroad. You can just eat and eat, buy and buy. It's just so tiring. Branded stuff are found in those branded shopping malls, foreign tourists able to get tax-refund when shopping."

2233,4.0,"Be ready to be accosted by free sample giving shop assistants and be ready to be wowed by all the products on offer. Before you buy anything, do check out this shop Baviphat, they have good discounts for some of the popular brands. Sometimes even 50%, I know, amazing right? Obviously I bought a lot :)"
2234,5.0,"Cosmetic Heaven. This is the phrase to describe it. You will be spoilt with plenty of cosmetic products such as facial cream, facial masks and so on. There are lots of promoters offering discounts on their products. At the end of the day, it is more of a question of preference and good bargain that will influence your spending. There are also lots of other shops around such as fashion boutiques, sports boutiques such as Nike, Adidas, New Balance, etc.  Overall, the place to be when you are in Seoul."
2235,5.0,"Myeongdong was the first place we went immediately after we checked-in from our accommodation, as it was so popular Seoul destination among tourists. Since it was a Friday, there were many tourists and there were lines of different street foods which are yumny and appetizing. Hence, we tried some of those and they were delicious but a little pricey compared to some delicious street foods we have here in the Phil. Shopping is fun as there were great items specially beauty and skin care products, where stores give lots of samples when you purchase. Tourists get to enjoy tax refund when you present your passport. Restaurants are all over, hence you can't go hungry while shopping. We had so much fun and enjoyable experience in Myeongdong when we splurged some money we saved for our Seoul trip. It's a happy place which we would definitely go back to in Seoul."
2236,5.0,"Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Great food, great value $$ shopping, fanastic beautiful autum scenery and safe environmental local exploration.. 😍💕"
2237,5.0,"Myeongdong is one of Seoul’s main shopping and tourism districts – so as you walk around, you’ll see many makeup stores, clothing stores, coffee shops, and restaurants.  As night begins to draw closer, people will begin setting up food stalls, so I highly recommend you stay to experience the food (I had my first Korean sweet potato at one of these food stalls! GOOD LORDY LORD WAS IT EVER DELICIOUS!)."
2238,5.0,Now this place takes markets to a different level it is spread out over a few blocks and it’s has just about everything from fresh produce to led lighting and some great food stalls try the mungbean fritters their great and you don’t get hassled their are also information people here and around certain parts of the city dressed up in red outfits to help you
2239,4.0,"Was there almost everyday on all of our stay in Seoul for past 8days, really lively shopping streets and like never ending fun and excitment. altho most shop selling same stuff, like cosmetic and accessories, the other street vendor does provide another revenue of excitment. theres a middle lane that sells food, of all kinds, but personally felt the price was steeper than other place, so we just try soe on our first day, like cheese lobster, garlic prawns (fav), pancakes, promogrenate drink, mixed friut drink, 21cm ice cream etc. but the most interesting is the small lane after that eat street that turns into another lane of chicken & beer joints, that feature 5-6 joint in one lane, plus DTF and 2 other western cafe, so we chose 1 on each day, do try out the 678 chicken, BHC and TwoTwo. oh and dun be afraid to que, coz its fast going."
2240,4.0,"If you have been to one market in Korea you have been to them all. Don't get me wrong it is fun and a wonderful experience, however, they are all much the same. A ton of people, food, and your typical carts. The food is wonderful and you can get some good prices on things."
2241,4.0,Shop till you drop here. A lot can be shop here. From cheap to expensive range. A must visit for travellers
2242,5.0,"A few tourist attractions are easily accessible from Myeongdong. There’s also the convenience of the subway and the airport bus. If you are into K-beauty, this is the place to shop for beauty products. There’s the Night market, plenty of street food, restaurants and cafes’ and shops. Lotte and Shinsegae are two major shopping / dept stores. The food court at Lotte is great!"

2245,5.0,Get your stomach ready for all the street food you can eat! Not only that but you can shop for everything you want and more!
2246,4.0,"Few months ago, I went Myeongdong with my Korean friend. We went Myeongdong fr bought some products and eat delicious food. In Myeongdong, there were so many kinds of street food such as chesses, Grilled Lobster with Butter, and juice. Also, there were so many cosmetics stores. In there, we can saw alomst kinds of cosmetics stores, restaurants or clothing stores. If you want to buy something during stay in Myeongdong, you can buy it immediately. Howvere the one thing that I was sad was there are too many people to do sometimg. For example, if you want some restaurent which is famous, you have to wait or reservation. Except this one thing, Myeongdong was the one of the best place that I played."
2247,4.0,"It’s mad busy with lots of street food. I’m not into shopping, but it was fun just to soak up the atmosphere - and then escape as it was soooo busy."
2248,4.0,"If you love cosmetics, then this is paradise for you. But what if you don't care about cosmetics? The street food will come to your rescue. The food stalls start setting up as early as 2pm. Either way, cosmetics or street food, be prepared to shell out a lot of money. Cosmetics are cheaper here but you will be tempted to buy everything that the salesladies offer to you. The top of my hand where they slather samples of the moisturizers, swatches of makeup, actually misses all the attention it got there. As to the street food, you think you're getting a bargain just having it for dinner. But before you know it, you've bought from 5 stalls and spent 30,000 won trying everything out. Good luck if your accommodation is in this area. You'll be broke by the middle of the week. Thank goodness I can charge the cosmetics to my credit card."
2249,4.0,We stopped here after Insa-dong and it was much busier but the shopping did not disappoint. Some of the souvenirs are a little more expensive than Insa-dong but a lot is comparable. This place gets pretty busy with cars driving through crowds of people. The street food is amazing! Definitely worth stopping to!
2250,5.0,"Good experience, haggle well. Nice street food. Quite a lot of interesting stuff being sold by hawkers."
2251,5.0,"Street food!

Well this is truly tourists area where you'll be happy to get lost here 😁😁  just make sure you empty your stomach and bring the cash!"
2252,4.0,Nobody does street shopping better than Asia and the Myeongdong was not exception. And the big plus is that the shop owners and shoppers are very considerate (with the exception of a few ugly tourists). And at night the place really lights up - don’t miss the experience.
2253,5.0,"Fun area to take a stroll in the evening. Everything from high-end shops to streetcar boutiques. In addition, a nice variety of delicious street food at low prices.  Definitely worth stopping by if you’re in the area."

And sometimes they offered you free sheet mask if you enter the shop even if you end up don't buy anything.  For the street food, there're a lot of it. But beware, it's so expensive.

2263,5.0,"To walk in the evening for this place is to find a living city site, calm people, food of all types and open stores for hours until late at night."
2264,1.0,Just a busy high street except though it appears pedestrian friendly it's not it's down right dangerous. You will not hear the traffic be it truck or moped because of music blaring away from outside the shops and people trying to get you into them. It's difficult to know whether you are being man handled into a store or rescued from a speeding car behind you. Good luck.
2265,5.0,We went here specifically to go moderate price Korean cosmetic shopping. There are many shops with good prices.  The thing that surprised me most is all of the street food and it all looked amazing.  Very safe area
2266,4.0,"Myeongdong is a bustling and colorful shopping street. You will find a lot of local brands like Top 10, Innis free and other cosmetic stores.

Worth your while to go around the this area."

I really love this place for street foods... Good place to do window shopping as well... Anyway u should visit there..."
2269,4.0,"There are lots of stores, clothes, cosmetics, shoes, but the real appeal is the food carts. Ranging from cheap ddobbki to real lobster tails there is something for every price range and food preference. Dont like street food, there are plenty of restaurants from K-bbq to McDonalds"

2272,5.0,Super nice place.. after 5lots of streetfood... made it super crowded sometimes. But nice experience overall
2273,4.0,"This shopping area is quite big but definitely can be covered within a couple of hours. There are many restaurants throughout but they are more hidden within alleys or up the stairwells. There are many repeats of the same stores over and over again, so I’m not too sure if it’s necessary to cover the whole area for some. At about 5-6pm, food stall vendor will line the Main Street. The food is excellent and there’s a huge variety, but it is slightly overpriced for certain items."
2274,5.0,It was our first time in Korea so the Myeongdong area was a treat for us with all the various shops plus street food variety. Be prepared with a budget for the things you may buy or the food you want to experience.

2277,3.0,"Unless you are into shopping, this is just another average shopping place so many locations around Seoul."
2278,5.0,This is a good place to do all your shopping spree. But be mindful of the money you have. The food is expensive so as the clothings but it's all tasty and fashionable.
2279,4.0,"Lots of shops selling facial products/ cosmetics , shoes , clothing etc. the food stalls are clean. I bought my sandwich at one of the stall when Isaac was closed"
2280,5.0,"DDP is good to shop clothing and Myeongdong is for you to shop cosmetics. There are a few good hotels inside the shopping street, it is very convenient if your aim is to shop until the last second. Plenty of F&B outlets for you to chose and lots of cafe too. Street food are also available but I found it not cheap...."
2281,5.0,"Myeongdong shopping street is probably the most famous amongst tourist. Very lively in the evening and nights. Most of the shops close by 11pm. Loads of beauty product shops. Do your research before buying any of the face mask. Like brand, your skin, which mask will suit you. Pricing in different shops, sale discount etc. Another place to get a good bargain for the beauty products is lotte shopping centre which is another area. Myeongdong shopping has got some good street food so definitely try them."
2282,4.0,"Come here to get your fix of cosmetics, skincare, street foods! Full of tourists so there are also plenty of restaurants around here. But now, the skincare brand shops like Tony Moly, The Saem, etc are so pushy where if you take the free mask that they offered on the street, they literally push you into the shop :( So rude. So if you are not interested in the brand, dont take their freebies offered."
2283,4.0,"Our first day in Seoul was at Myeongdong and it was a very interesting site for visitors like me who loves food. The streets were lined up with carts and carts of street food, and different kinds, as well as shops selling clothes and a lot of cosmetic products. Sampling the street food was a very enjoyable experience, and filling too. Again, wear comfortable shoes (and bring lots of money)."

2285,4.0,"Stayed for 2 weeks near the Myeongdong Shipping street. We only made one purchase (mostly b/c we still had 3 more months of travel ahead of us and didn't want to carry the extra weight around). Is a great place to visit for all sorts of shopping, especially K-beauty. There are literally 3-4 storefronts for the same beauty shops scattered throughout the shopping district, so its easy to get lost. Make sure you have the Naver app to help you navigate the small streets."
2286,5.0,"If you are looking for street food and skin care brands, come to Myeongdong. Other stores such as jdsports, abc mart etc. Alot of restaurant along the main street and also in the alleyway. Come at night as it is very lively with the street vendors."

2288,5.0,"As we stayed in the heart of Myeongdong for 6 nights, I can say without a doubt that Monday was the least crowded - also because the food stands were mostly on a break! On Tuesdays from 5pm it gets pretty packed and crazy again!  This is the place to pick up all the main cosmetic brands and also a chance to snack on all the “local” street snacks. What I liked about it was that you can find all the big korean brands here so it feels like a one-stop along with sportswear. It’s like the “in” thing right now so there are many sneakers/sports shops at each corner from Adidas to JD to New Balance etc.  Highly recommend for all who are visiting!"
2289,5.0,"Myeongdong is not a quiet place for serenity.  This is a popular area about ½ square kilometers in size with a plethora of shopping and restaurants along narrow streets that still allow cars. There usually are only a few vehicles traveling slowing amongst the crowd. There were many street food vendors when we were there, but I personally was not too impressed with the quality of the food.

2321,5.0,The steet food was the best part! There are a great deal of shops but most are the same as you would see anywhere else.  The street food however was fantastic. I tried several different things and it was a great experience.
2322,5.0,"This place is RIDICULOUS - so many shops, especially skincare and beauty, plus loads of cute stores like Line Friends and ARTBOX. I saved up my shopping for the last day! There are loads of little side streets and turns you can take and it would be easy to get lost but it’s shaped like a grid so it’s actually not that difficult to find your way back to where you start, only problem is there are multiple sites for shops, like there’s about 3 branches of Tony Moly within the same area so don’t use a brand like that as your signpost! I recommend getting cake at Billy Angel while you’re there..."
2323,5.0,"If you are looking for shop for cosmetics then you are in for a treat. If you are looking for shoes and food, then you can find them here too. Shops offer instant tax rebate and you can shop to your heart's content."

2329,3.0,I found this area boring. It might as well be Tokyo or Paris. Same brands everywhere. The only thing which is different is that there is a lot of cosmetic shops. Since I don’t use that I found the area boring. Many other things to do instead.

2342,5.0,"Loved every bit of it..  Lotte young plaza and lotte plaza are 2 of the bigger malls in this area. But you do get multiple other malls as well.  You must visit the underground shopping center which is situated near the lotte young plaza  In the evening the area bursts into life with action stations of delicious street food. Craving for some of it right now!  Shops are open till 10pm but the larger 2 malls close a bit earlier than that.  Ooh and if you are a k-pop fan.. loads of merchandise!! Including pop up stores..  I stayed at the sotetsu hotel, the splasir myeong-dong. Which was nice and cozy. However, there are many hotels around that area that you can try out as well  Overall.. a must visit. Im definitely visiting again!"

Aside from so much to shop, from make up to souvenirs, trying out different street food will take up so much of your time. Given the chance, we could stay here all day long. And the photos will show how shopaholic we all are."
2345,4.0,Myeong-dong is a pretty touristy spot but also perfect for shopping. There are department stores as well as small stalls with local food or souvenirs. The mix is pretty nice and even though it’s very crowded it’s not hectic at all. We liked it there a lot.

2347,1.0,"We took a nice hotel in this area after hearing about this ""wonderful"" shopping district. The hotels and surrounding areas are quite nice and elegant, but those shopping streets are more like a flea-market that is run mostly by Chinese... Location is still nice and central, but there is nothing particularly interesting to buy here and no decent restaurant for regular tourist. Seoul is a beautiful city and there are much better areas for tourists."
2348,4.0,"This place is a must see if you want to experience cosmetic/beauty shopping on Korea. The shopping streets are filled with various beauty shops, all offering 50% off or buy one get one free on skincare products, especially face masks. They even have suitcases you can buy at the till if you want to buy a lot of stuff. They all try and get you into the shop by offering you a free face mask. The face mask they give you for free, is being sold for approx 10000 won inside the shop. Once you take this mask, the shop assistants inside follow you around like a lost dog. It is a good experience, you just need to be clear as to how much you want to spend because it can get a bit out of hand as there is so much to choose from! Otherwise on the street, there are the general shops: Zara, H&M, a very cheap pharmacy, restaurants etc. Taxis are also plentiful in this area, and are very very cheap."

The area has all the large high end fashion boutiques and department stores (Lotte Department Store) you could ever want as well as a huge range of high street stores, some I knew some I did not. In addition to this the array of food eateries was wonderful! I have to say that hand on heart my most favorite part was the street food vendors that set up every afternoon and are there until the wee small hours. Absolutely amazing range of food to choose form and the smells as you pass the sweet and savory selections are wonderful. My son and I went there one evening to just try everything we could in place of going out for dinner. I highly recommend Tornado Potatoes and he particularly loved the Octopus and Lobster food stalls. I am going back again early next year as I had the best time!"

2370,4.0,"I love to shop and I gotta admit that it was really fun and exciting exploring this place in the beginning, but it got REALLY boring and repetitive after like two days because the stores were all chain stores so they just kept repeating itself... the chain stores didn’t have much variation and options either so it gets boring after looking at the same stuff all day. Also, the only deals that are worth it are the ones that are like “buy one get one free” or “buy two get one free” deals, otherwise everything else is sold at retail price and it’s not worth it."
2371,5.0,If you love skincare/cosmetics/make up here are the right place. U can buy mask at cheaper price 😍 and also I in love with the saem liptint!

2412,5.0,"Really fun to pop into the stores in this area. There are also sometimes street vendors selling food or t-shirts and colourful socks that make great souvenirs. There are also a lot of of K Beauty shops in this area, so stock up on your face masks! Try not to get lost while you are having fun shopping!"
2413,4.0,Go at night for the most action. Street vendors in addition to the big stores. Will be crowded but a fun stroll. Lots of food options.
2414,4.0,"As we lived just in connection to this area, we walked those streets on a daily basis! Loads of beauty shopping.. masks, skin-care, make-up you name it!  I would recomend you to read up on brands in advance and decide approximately what you are after ;). It is very easy to get ""sucked-in"" to the stores and get things sold to you that you weren't going to buy :D. No matter if you are male or female, there are masks for everything! Beard? no problem, there are solutions for that too :P.  Among all beauty shops, there are plenty of food places and in the evening, the street-market-stalls comes out!"
2415,5.0,"We visited regularly during our trip to Seoul, almost everyday. The street food is amazing, ranging from light snacks to almost full meals. Although the crowd is huge, you don't feel like a foreigner while walking the streets due to the diversity of people and goods."
2416,4.0,"There are many many shops there such as cosmetic, street food, clothes and so on. There are many variety of cosmetic products. My wife really enjoy her shopping there."
2417,5.0,The best place to shop and eat whilst in Korea. Best experience of the nightlife in Korea too. You can get all your souvenirs from here.
2418,5.0,"Excellent place to be with teenagers, shops catter to all tastes but mainly youngsters. Very good value cosmetics and restaurants. Definitely a must in Seoul!"
2419,5.0,"If you are looking for a place with concentrated great foods, great shops, and great local street stands, then this place is for you."
2420,4.0,Busy place with lots of shopping for cosmetics. The Information centers offers free hanbok trial for 10 mins but you need to register upfront.
2421,5.0,"This place is so lively! Several streets lined with boutiques, skincare products, famous branded shops, restaurants, cafes, groceries, money changers, etc..... and by 2pm in the afternoon you start seeing food vendors and all sorts of products wheeling in their carts! They last till around 1 in the morning! The place is so alive! The street food is too awesome to describe! From bbq’s, kebabs, sushi’s, scallops, lobsters, etc..... this place sells the best street food in all of Asia! They are very clean! When going to Korea, Myeongdong is the place to stay! Metro is also near by."
2422,5.0,The shopping is plentiful with many clothing and cosmetic stores. You can get free face mask samples if you look through the stores for a few minutes. During the day it’s pretty normal streets and stores but at night all the street food carts come out with really tasty and traditional foods for only a few dollars each. Most vendors speak English or get by with pointing. Many sit down restaurants are located on the 2nd floor or higher so don’t forget to look up. It’s very safe area and gets busy but not overly crowded. Accessible by the metro train.
2423,5.0,This place is a foodies paradise. All of the foods that you see ppl on YouTube walking down these alleys eating are right here cooked right in front of you. And the prices are only a couple of bucks an item.
2424,5.0,"Good destination for shopping of beauty products. Street foods are good, yummy but not that expensive as you think, :-)"
2425,4.0,"This is by far the most amazing in place for shopping and window shopping skincare and beauty products. You can get there by metro and get off in the Station with the same name. You can also find restaurants and bars to go during, after or before shopping. Locals are crazy for this type of products, foreigners have a difficult time to decide whether to spend all their money there Or not. Such a wonderful experience for men (set up a business) and women (makeup and skincare products). U can’t miss it"
2426,5.0,"Visited this district during my stay. There are lots of shops underground and above ground (don’t forget to look up). There are shops for everything from clothes, pharmacies, food, banks, electronics, high-end, low-end.  If you are a price conscious for clothes then go window shop in the brand name stores and then head out to the street or underground and by a similar looking style for much much less."
2427,5.0,Has all the recent cosmetics in the shop with new and innovative products. Also had dinner in one of the famous soup places nearby.
2428,5.0,"If you are visiting Seoul, take your time and visit this street! Especially in the evening. Go there hungry and taste the greatest street food of all time. Sooo many things to choose between. The only thing I can warn about is that buy anything from the little street sellers.. too expensive for Koreas street selling 😁"
2429,5.0,"There is an obscene amount of skin care stores, which is kind of obnoxious. That said, there are a zillion things going on and a lot of interesting things to see. You could certainly be occupied here for hours just people watching. I like it and will probably go back. There is a small concentration of obnoxious religious zealots with megaphones, and pushing pamphlets on you. They seemed kind of concentrated to a certain area, so it's not an overall issue."
2430,4.0,"Get yourself a map before you explore the place as it is VERY BIG and can be quite confusing and daunting for first timers. You can find almost every brand possible here, with one brand has several stores spread in every junction. Great place to look for cheap clothes on their outlets, too. Visit the LINE friends store to take a picture with giant Brown. There are some street food stalls and restaurants. The recommended one is Myeongdong Gyoza with their famous guksu (noodles) and, obviously, gyoza."
2431,5.0,umpteenth times here and i am still not satisfied haha 😂 u definitely can bargain more if u know more korean and if u buy a lot! #makeupheaven #skincareheaven
2432,5.0,"This is a place to go for cosmetics. Huge variety of street food stalls, don't miss tempura shrimp. Lots of fashion shops and restaurants."
2433,4.0,Stayed in area. Very fun and interesting. Lots of different shops and restaurants in walking distance. Convenient for airport shuttle and subway.
2434,5.0,"So many stores! Lots of skincare/cosmetics stores, jewelry, cheap clothing, knock off designer goods, souvenirs and tons of street food and restaurants. Still active at 11pm."
2435,4.0,After 4:00pm a lot of street food stands will be open and you can enjoy different types of Korean food. Shopping at Myeongdon is also very convenient.
2436,5.0,"so many cosmetics store (mostly korean brand), like innisfree, etude house, nature republic, holikaholika, tonymoly, and many more, and every brand has more than 1 store so if you found that the product is sold out in one store, you can try to find it in another store. overall the beauty advisors are helpful, esp in Lush store, they spoke english fluently.  In myeongdong u can find not only cosmetics, but also restaurants and street food.  the street is clean and at the most of time is crowded, especially at night"
2437,5.0,"Cosmetics, cosmetics everywhere on this street. Great place for sampling cosmetics and getting great deals and discounts on cosmetics. In the evenings, this place lights up and offers a variety of street food options, which are a must try. There is also an undergrund market here, which also is quite good. Moreover, the best part is that you can claim your tax free refunds right here, as the office is located inside BOOTS Pharmacy on this main street. Overall, a must visit place in Seoul"
2438,5.0,SHOPPED and bought soooooo much korean products that we had to send a 50kg parcel back to SG from Seoul. Amazing place to shop till you drop! Lots of quaint cafes and street food!
2439,5.0,"We came here twice. 1 in the afternoon and once in the evening. It is much livelier and fun to go evening after 5pm. The stalls are fully opened and yes there are crowds but thats what makes a night market special. I was travelling with a 4yo with stroller and I can still move around comfortably. And that was on friday night. Managed to get some muslim friendly and halal street foods. Also some good bargains for skin cares, shoes and clothes for the teens girls. We spent a few hours here shopping. About same price a Bugis St in spore. We got jeans at $16 or so. The lobster tail was 15,000won per oc was so WORTH IT. Give it a try once. The Cheesy scallop was 10,000won but lobster was better! I love the fried cheese which was mildly sweet. The 32cm ice-cream was 2000won each. Some say its icy but it was good as not too sweet not creamy. Great place :)"
2440,4.0,"Myeongdong is where you want to shop when in S. Korea, there are alot of good stuff you can buy for a reasonable price. What I really love about this place, aside from the variety of things it offers, is the freebies most specifically beauty products."
2441,4.0,"Traveled June 2018. Great street food, but expensive. It's cheaper to eat in the restaurants. Some stores have salespeople in front of the store to encourage you to come in. Don't take the things they hand out unless you plan to shop in the store and it's not free. It's good to learn the phrase ""I'm just browsing"" in Korean so the salespeople will leave you alone when you're in the store instead of aggressively trying to sell you things. Korean salespeople are quite aggressive. They'll pounce on you as soon as you glance at an item. The cosmetics are cheaper at the airport, but not all items are available at the airport. The street vendors don't come out until after 4PM. Much livelier at night. Bought prescription eyeglasses and frames at Kaist Optical. For transition glasses with protective coatings and frames, it was $190. The eye exam isn't as thorough as the U.S. but if you don't have major eye problems, it seems sufficient. My son has a heavy prescription with astigmatism. Much lighter frames than U.S. frames. Cheaper than Costco in the U.S. The savings are from the frames and free eye exam. The lens is the same as Costco. Milky Bee and 32cm ice cream was only good for pictures. They're icy, not creamy. I liked the Dragon's beard candy. It wasn't as sweet as american candy. What I liked about Korean fried chicken is the sauce and crispiness."
2442,4.0,"This place is wall to wall cosmetics and beauty stores, a big line store is there and also shoe stores and restaurants,the place tend to be crowded at night less people on the day time.. a good place to visit for the experience"
2443,5.0,"As the name suggests, this place is a shopping street that is very happening day or night. Numerous places for shopping as well as dining options from street food to restaurants. Highly recommended!"
2444,5.0,"If you like face products this is the place for you. Basically the same stores show up on every block, it is amazing they can keep all the stores in business in such a small area. Food carts come out in the late afternoon."
2445,5.0,"Lots of stores and restaurants in this area ranging from local brands to international mid-tier. Street food is a bit pricey, but good variety and small portions so you can try a lot."
2446,5.0,"Cosmetics haven for the interested. Many roadside stalls selling street food, bags, accessories etc. Many restaurants and cafes too. Isaac toast and Nanta theater nearby. A great place to hang out and chill if you like crowds."
2447,5.0,"If you have never been to Seoul, Myeongdong is probably the most happening shopping street you should go to.  Getting there is easy by subway, and you could make your way out of the station from exit 5-7. Exit 5-6 is where Shinsegae dept store is and it will lead you to the walking streets in Myeongdong as well.  Along the streets, there are many beauty brands, sports brand, fashion labels as well as accessories shops. The shopping is endless and after awhile, you probably noticed that there are more than 1 shop for each beauty labels at different parts of Myeongdong. So if you cannot get what you want at 1 shop, move on, you probably see the same brand again later.  There are also many food options, and by late noon, hawkers will start setting up their mobile food stalls along the streets. Saw cheese lobsters going for 15,000 won, which i think is overpriced. There were roasted chestnuts stall, king prawns stall and fishcake stall as well.  Actually, Myeongdong is connected to Namdaemun market. In the past when I visited Seoul, I used to walk through Namdaemum market to Myeongdong and things at Namdaemum is slightly cheaper than Myeongdong. For those who have alot of time on hand, try walking from Namdaemum to Myeongdong for a better shopping experience."
2448,5.0,"They say that Korea is known for their cosmetics and that anyone visiting Korea should pop by the area for some serious shopping! Indeed, I spent quite a fair bit of money on masks and other products. Other than that, theres a lot of good food available in Myeongdong area! Street snacks too!  You may/ may not find your way around easily but every area has its own beauty!  Definitely a place where you can shop and eat till you drop!"
2449,4.0,This street is bustling with activities from morning till night! If u like Korean Street food and shopping this is a good place to go. Try strawberry mochii & the tornado potato. The things are not that cheap though. There is a cat cafe there and many restaurants to try too!
2450,5.0,Great places for foodies. Looks of places to shop and eat. Price are not cheap. Good atmosphere and super crowed
2451,4.0,"The tourist must-go on their visits to Seoul to get their cheap makeup and skincare. GO CRAZY OVER THERE!  Pretty good with bustling crowds - adds to the atmosphere.  Street food carts pretty expensive. Do not recommend you getting food from there, don’t be lazy, use your GPS and take a short walk over to Namdaemun market for cheaper and authentic Korean food (daaaamn those dumplings, hotteok and bibimbaps)"
2452,5.0,"A lot of food vendors at night. Great for shopping, H&M, Forever 21, Adidas, a lot of stores for beauty product (which stay open very late). Couple of bars around. Overall a chill place to walk around and taste the different foods and do a little shopping."
2453,4.0,"True, there is nothing that sets this shopping street apart from any other in Asia, but I had nice strolls at different times of day. The street food was tasty, I felt safe, and enjoyed watching the people. I treated myself to some Korean lipstick as cosmetics are all the rage. You can find almost anything there and in every price point all around this area."
2454,5.0,"This is located at station Sinsa (subway line3) exit #8 - go straight until you get to Dosandaero 13gil and J tower(very high building) will be opposite side in front of you - take Dosandaero 13gil which is Garosugil  Where is less crowded and lots of nice shop (local, chain, highend). Loads of restaurants, rooftop cafes! We can spend whole day there."
2455,5.0,"very animated open air market and shops along the small streets. Sportswear, cosmetics, food and otehr attractions are there. Music and free wifi almost everywhere. Recommended for good deals and discounts."
2456,5.0,"The place is huge with lots of skincare stores. It is almost a one stop place for whatever skincare products that you are looking for. You can find the same brand in every corner and if you miss one, not to worry, you will find another one just round the next corner. To get good bargains, it is probably better to go during weekends as it seems to have more good bargains such as 1 + 1 or 2 plus 2. One tip is to if to their main store as you can find better bargains. One gets easily lost in the maze of shops. It will be good to identify a few landmarks to help you get your way around. At around four to five, there will be street stalls selling various food."
2457,5.0,"If you are looking for a good place to spend the money, here is a must! Long walking street packed with shops, restaurants and vendor's carts. Lotte department store also located at the same area. Totally recommended to wander around even window shopping 😄"
2458,5.0,"This place is what i have in mind when I visit shopping street. Lots of shops shouting for attention, lots of street food. Yet there is still sufficient space to stand and look at what is for sale."
2459,5.0,"If youre looking for cosmetics and street food, then, this is the place that you should visit.  Lots of stores are open until 11pm and food stalls offering wide range of food types: lobsters, steak, ice cream, dumpling, churros and so much more. I recommend to try the lobster. A bit expensive but tastes sooooo good  For the shopping part, most stores give small freebies such as face masks, facial cream. You get a little something even if you dont buy anything 😀"
2460,3.0,"Like any other big city, the shopping district can be a rather interesting experience and the Myeongdong area in Seoul is not different. In my opinion, this is nothing special - there's a ton of people and stores selling everything between heaven and earth, most of which seem like rubbish quality. In terms of safety, Korea in general is a plus. Not at one time, did we fear anything and even when crowded, it's a safe place."
2461,4.0,Its a nice area to be there especially in the evening when the weather is cool. The place is busy and there is alot of people. There are many street stalls selling a variety of food and its nice. There are also a lot of shops to do your shopping and restaurants to eat.
2462,3.0,Def stop in to grab your Korean skincare (Ennis Free) but no reason to hang out unless the street food vendors are set up.
2463,5.0,"I have been to multiple international shopping zones in my 50+ years of traveling... this is incredible for the diversity of vendors, bargains, and products.. the ability to negotiate is crucial to having an awesome time... this is your prime location in South Korea make sure your shoes are comfortable and that you are prepared for wonderful options.."
2464,5.0,My husband and I decided to stay in Myeongdong and we loved it. At night the streets are full of street food and the shops open till late.  Best place to shop for cosmetics and face products. A few of the shops are actually tax free too.  Do not forget to buy the cute Korean socks for cheap.  I also enjoyed the Korean fried chicken street where you have a range of chain restaurants specialised only in Korean fried chicken and beer.
2465,4.0,Very exciting place to visit take your time lots of shopping malls but do take time to look around the back streets this is the best part.
2466,5.0,Myeong-Dong becomes really crowded and busy at night. So much to see and eat. Prices aren’t exactly cheap and not everything you see is delicious. You can’t go wrong with the desserts and the takoyaki balls but the egg toast and gimbap aren’t that delicious.  So many Korean beauty and skincare shops. Many are repeated. I didn’t enjoy people trying to give me ‘free’ face masks. Some can be quite aggressive. Don’t take them unless you want to go into the shop to buy.
2467,5.0,"Been to other Asian countries for cheap street shopping but Myeongdong is one of the shopping areas that you would always want to go back. Here you would find several good finds for cosmetics, accessories, clothes, bags, toys, Korea merchandise, etc. Along the streets you will also be tempted to try different kinds of street foods and drinks. The area also have several restaurants, coffee shops and dessert places. Some shops close at 10pm while the rest closes at 11pm so better go there early night time. Our family went there for about 4 times in our 6-days in Korea and we still can't get enough."
2468,5.0,A place you need to go while visiting Seoul. It looks like things at starting in the afternoon and end very late at night. Eating in the street is the sport here.
2469,4.0,Lots of cosmetics store along the street good for women to shop. And at night time lots of food vendor with good food to try.
2470,5.0,"My favorite shopping place, but if you want a dress better try to buy from underground shopping centre it is much cheaper. We were new at this place we bought one dress from the first shop we saw and found out it was quite expensive than other shops. There are a lot of free mask samples in beauty shop products like etude house which i think they have 3 or more shops here. We tried many street foods here from ice cream, lobster, steaks and many more. If you dont like spending a lot dont go here hehehe."
2471,5.0,"A must visit in Seoul! These narrow streets are packed with tons and tons of cosmetic & skin care stores, clothes stores and street food. It seemed endless and it's easy to spend one whole day just wonder around this area.  Pro tip: there are a lot of hidden away gem above the ground floor shops, so look closely!"
2472,5.0,"Lots of interesting street food ranging from Turkish ice cream to all sorts of Korean delicacies, the while Myeongdong area is a street food and shopping paradise (particularly for the ladies interested inKorean cosmetics). Very busy till after eleven but still manageable crowds in early June; could imagine things getting a bit out of hand at peak season or when Chinese tourists return in force. Spent a couple of enjoyable evenings there!"
2473,4.0,The shopping area is not too large and is manageable. Take a slow walk in the morning as some shops open as early as 8 am. There are plenty of good restaurants here and after 6pm there are also many street hawker serving delicious food. Fruits sold at the fruit stall here may not be fresh so I would rather get it from the supermarket. Other than that non appetite and happy shopping!
2474,5.0,This is the Seoul version of Ximending in Taiwan.  Streets full of people night or day. Plenty to see and shop but prices are pricier here at this touristy place. Vibes are good and exciting full of young people and tourists.
2475,4.0,"Lots and lots of street food. Loved the lobster, pork skewer, kimbap, octopus ball. Did not like the s’mores. Trying to hard to copy Dominique Ansel and it’s not cheap!! Very difficult to find rubbish bin in this area but each designated shop has their own rubbish bin."
2476,5.0,"This is a must if you want to experience shopping for gifts for friends and family. So many different stores and vendors. However, put on some comfortable walking shoes. Glad I did. Ended up waking about 3.5 miles, but worth it! Also, price compare, cause some items will be cheaper in some stores or vendors. Also they have some really cool traditional street shows with traditional dancing in traditional attire. Other fun places are the tea houses. Enjoy!!!"
2477,5.0,It could be a nice area to hangout so many shop especially cosmetic If you’re are fan of skin care you’re on a right place
2478,4.0,"This was day 3 of our famtour - the place is a shop a holics’ paradise! So many shops and stalls where you can buy practically anything and everything! Just our luck, we suddenly heard sirens and firetrucks coming our way, theres a fire on one if the restaurants! I counted 5 firetrucks making there way to the very busy and crowded streets. Good thing the people did not panic. The fire was out quicks and with no casualty."
2479,5.0,"This is one of those must visit places in Seoul. There is a variety of street food and other stalls, as well as an overwhelming array of cosmetics. Surely a great temptation for all"
2480,5.0,There's so many beauty products you can see in every corner of the shopping street. There's also a nice selection of clothes and shoes.
2481,4.0,"There are a lot of cosmetic shops opened by Chinese, which might not be selling authentic products. Most of the time, the price is slightly lower than the authentic products, while the quality is not on par. Thus, the best place to shop is still the duty free area, instead of the shopping street."
2482,4.0,When you walk around in seoul it is advice to pass by this street! It's crowed and nice but still fun for a walk.
2483,5.0,We love this place myself I been here so many time good place to shop and eat street food ! The price is good but remember you pay what you got for ok !! This place day or night the same attraction with a lot of local and tourists walk and shopping!! You will be there in June 5 can’t wait!
2484,4.0,"If you enjoy shopping a lot surely this place will be your first destination. Aside from this, you can also explore Korean street food during afternoon and appreciate korean its unique taste that savors your day!!!"
2485,5.0,"My wife insisted, ""There will be skin care products!"" And there were. If you're in the market for cosmetics, clothes, and the full Korean 10-step skin care routine, you cannot miss out on Myeongdong. Although quiet during the day, the place really comes alive from early evening. It's not too expensive either - you can definitely get some good deals, some which are announced loudly by trendy salespeople standing outside their designated shops.  If you're not looking for a new concealer, maybe you're like me and looking for some good food - luckily, the street has a lot of this as well! There are many street food vendors with delicious food, whether you want spicy chicken, fried octopus, tasty ice cream, sticky strawberry mochi, or something else. There are also a lot of restaurants down the side alleys, but since a lot of these will only be advertised in Korean, my advice is to do your research from home and have a few noted down before going. Else you might just end up living on street food. Which, to be fair, is not a bad way to end the night. It's good, and it's cheap."
2486,3.0,Many shops located in a maze of streets and side streets. Lots of outdoor food stalls. A wide selection of stores and eating places
2487,4.0,"There are dozens of stalls selling several food items. While the quality varies it's nice to try several items. Furthermore, there are about a million stores selling cosmetics and clothes. It's crowded at night and especially on weekends."
2488,5.0,"Fun for everyone but make sure you that together as easy to get lost in the crowd. Shop after shop of clothes or cosmetics. Don’t forget to pick up your goodies here! Every shop almost gives out free samples upon purchase and some of the deals are REALLY GOOD.  Then there’s the street food. The street is lined with food carts selling mocha, strawberries, ice cream, sushi, grilled meats and seafood and other yummy items.  there’s also big brands like Zara, H&M, ABC mart, Boots and uniqlo. Definitely worthwhile to spend a few hours here to get all the shopping done!"
2489,5.0,Cheap place to shop just like Namdaemun Market . I love the area. You can find fake designer stuffs here. Lotsof cheap stuffs.
2490,3.0,"A lot of amazing and tasty street food there, in every single corner of Myeongdong. You should try some, especially the original fish ice cream. The night market will be more crowded, so be careful with your belongings."
2491,5.0,"Nice place to enjoy street food, fruit juice, ice cream and lot more along with your shopping. Place is full of cosmetic shops. Enjoy !"
2492,5.0,"I was staying at Courtyard Marriott Namdaemun (see my review for the hotel). It was a 15 minute walk to Myendong. It is a very inetersting market with lots of shops, specially a lot of skin and make up products for women. What amazed me was all the variety of street food. I tried a few and they were all delicious. I highly recommend strolling through this great shopping area and be adventurous and try some of the street foods. You will be surprised.  You can also take Subway line 4 to Myendong Station, snd the market is steps away  Also Walk 15 minutes to Namdaemun Market for super Cheap stuff."
2493,4.0,"I don't like to shop much but this place is massive and pretty interesting. It has a bit for everyone....but then again that's what most shopping areas cater to ya? I guess you've got to come at least once. Especially for tourists. It is VERY touristy, but hey - I'm a tourist so let it be! There are quite a bit of food places around for you to indulge. Street food on the whole is not very attractive in terms of pricing to me compared to Taipei, this place is a rip off. But we're not in Taipei are we? Transport wise it's very accessible. Metro, buses or cab - take your pick. We had a hotel shuttle that operates in this area so it was even easier."
2494,5.0,"This the place with the product so cheap!! For foreign like me, i love it so much! I can find all of skincare that i want"
2495,5.0,"This place is seriously one of the best things in Seoul. All the shops and the hustle-bustle feel to the place is contrasted nicely with the nice quiet Cathedral in the back corner.  Make sure to come hungry, the street food here is the best and most unique stuff you’ll find, plus it’s CHEAP! Great for vegans, and vegetarians"
2496,4.0,"This street has a good mix of retail stores, marts, restaurants, cafes and street food carts. A must go to place when in Seoul."
2497,5.0,"Spare your money here! I love myeongdong! Cosmetic & skin care shop list never end. If you looking for COSRX & klairs go to Aland shop and for tax refund go to Wonder Place shop level 3, nearby Aland. Other brand like Uniqlo, Fila, spao and the list goes on. Happy shopping!"
2498,4.0,"When I was in Korea I went to Myeongdong it was around 4 pm and the street vendors were starting to set up. There was a lot of food, makeup and clothing stores. The food and clothes were relatively cheap, however the makeup could get a little expensive. Be prepared to walk nonstop."
2499,5.0,"We stayed at the Hotel28, which was perfect if you want immediate exposure to Myeongdong District. This is a very large, active shopping area with many street vendors offering freshly fried potato chips, shrimp, sausage, pastries, etc. While we here, we had the unfortunate timing of extremely cold weather (0 degrees F or -18 C); however, the markets were always packed. Wherever we went, the streets here (and all over Seoul) were well maintained and exceptionally clean."
2500,1.0,"I was travelling in Seoul the first time and had the worst shopping experience I've ever had so far. I was shopping clothes in one of stores and there were some problems I was trying to ask the lady behind the counter. She got impatient and annoyed at me very quick because she couldn't understand English well. The harder I tried to explain the angrier she became. She eventually told me to get lost of her shop as she can't be brother to deal with me. I was shocked and humiliated. I've never been treated like that. I don't think I want to go to the place anymore. If you'd like to shop, try somewhere else besides myeobgdong.

2506,4.0,"Myeongdong is a hype place to shop cheap things and to buy souvenirs and eat halal street food at the street marker itself. Also, along Myeongdong walkway at the train station itself, you will find shops that sells just about anything, traveling bags, travelling clothing, inner wear, souvenirs etc. A good plc for a good bargain!"
2507,5.0,"Great shopping district especially for those who love fashion, Korean street food and late night desserts! Lots of choices and prices are relatively reasonable.

2509,4.0,"I think this area is worth your time exploring. You likely can find what you wants to buy, from this place. There are plenty of shops selling clothing, bags, shoes, toys etc etc. Plenty of street hawkers as well. You will be spoiled for choices. Try to move around comparing prices if you have the extra time and energy, as the same item can be going at different prices at different shops. Can be quite crowded so please take care of your belongings when there."
2510,4.0,If one loves shopping and food Myeongdong is the place. We went there in the evening and noticed that it was a very well lit and lively area. A happening place with crowds of people. It had both locals and tourists. One could shop anything from there famous cosmetics to clothes shoes artificial jewellery Shops like Uniglo Zara H&M Nike were also flooded with shoppers. You get immediate tax refund in some shops if you are carrying passport with you. Myeongdong is the place for food lovers. The streets are lined with all food stalls. I loved eating roasted chestnuts and the berry juice was amazing. There were hardly any dustbins and one is supposed to carry your junk back with you You could even choose small restaurants to fine dining restaurants If you ran short of money there were many money changers there giving good rates It was easy to spend a few enjoyable hours here It is easily accessible by subway
2511,5.0,"We witnessed hail for like 3 mins. That's the first one we saw in our whole life. We're here for the skincare products since Myeongdong is known for that. But aside from skin care, you can find lots of stuff here including massage place, restaurants, Korean mart, accessories and many more."
2512,5.0,"If you have visited Taipei's ximending, i would say this is much bigger compared to it. You will find many brands of cosmetics, fashion, restaurants, coffee places, cinemas and also duty free shops. Many of the cosmetic shops offer direct tax refund. At night you can try all the korean street food along the roads. Careful that you will get lost. They have map to make your shopping experience easier. People tend to visit here more than 1 time. Well i personally go there more than 5 times during my 2 week visit to Seoul. Famous restaurants like myeongdong kyoja, yoogane, aori ramen until Chinese ding tai fung are there. Of course , you do not wanna miss chicken and beer restaurants. You also can find fashion like H&M, uniqlo, zara , forever 21, spao, top ten etc. It is a great place to shop and dine."
2513,4.0,"This is a great area to get the best of everything - shopping, street food, restaurants and even massage places : be sure to get a foot rub. We had one after a long day on the feet for 18000 won for 40mins. Also recommend going at night. This place is not for you if you don't like crowds because this area is humming with people both foreigners and locals which makes it all an amazing atmosphere."
2514,3.0,"Shopping street is ok especially for cosmetic products,the good thing are many great Korean restaurants around if you like to do shopping and have a nice Korean meal"
2515,5.0,"Myeongdong best shopping of the year hahahahhaha.. make up, shoes, clothes dll you must come myeongdong"
2516,5.0,"Clothes, food, clothes and more food! If you're looking for street food, this is the place to come and do it, while clothes and trinket shopping. You have massive options, and the portions are small enough that you can go from stall to stall to try other things too. Theres very few rubbish bins about to be wary about that. Some of the stall owners will be nice enough and take your rubbish, even if it's from other stalls :)"
2517,4.0,"Sent a week in Seoul within walking distance of the Myeongdong Market . Although the market area has lots of stores and shops that are open during the day for shopping, the magic of the are is in the evening when street vendors roll in and setup and offer street food. It’s fantastic! You can find all kinds of creative offerings. There’s lots of color, food,and people. The spirit and energy is terrific. Check it out!"
2518,5.0,great place for those looking for makeups as they have lots of shop lots here.. street food was great as well..
2519,4.0,"This is a very popular area to shop. There is a large variety of stores, but I would recommend going to Uniqlo for great quality and unique every day styles. Be sure to get street food, but skip the waffles. I found them to be too sweet and not worth the hype. Little pastries in the shape of fish filled with custard or red beans are a much better choice."
2520,2.0,"This is an overpriced tacky place where people go to look the same. Many of the streets have the same shops on them, so you can look exactly like everyone else in Seoul. Shudder.  There are some cool street merchants and the century old Catholic Church on the hill are a nice diverting highlight."
2521,5.0,"The streets and alleys of Myeongdong is an organized maze of clothes, shoes, accessories, make-up, skin products, and street food for all kinds of budget, mid-price to high price. With the popularity of K-pop, comes the popularity of Korean clothing styles and Korean makeup.This is the place to be! After hours of shopping and you're craving some Korean food - don't go any farther. The streets are lined with food stalls and fancy restaurants. It is Seoul's No.1 shopping district."
2522,5.0,One of the best street food experiences I’ve ever had.  Everything was super hygienic and tasted incredible.  We had cheese baked lobsters and Friend Prawns and Oysters and BBQ Chicken!  Also the cosmetics shopping was insane.  I feel its a must for anyone’s trip to this awesome city!
2523,5.0,A lot of beauty products and clothes were on sale. They give free sample of their products in exchange you enter their shop weather you buy or not. Visit on your last day as it will take all your money if you cannot control buying🤣 You will not get hungry nor thirsty as local foods were all around
2524,5.0,"The street comes alive in the afternoon with all the streets hawkers. Their price is the same for the same items so no need to bargain or compare. Many shops like fila, adidas, nike, uniqlo, spao, abc mart and many more."
2525,5.0,"Amazing outdoor market close to the Myeongdong station. It seems to cover the whole area where you have a series of food stalls as well as clothing, souvenir or sock stalls sprinkled among them. The shops line the edges of the street which can sell plenty of things like beauty products or clothing. There are also restaurants hidden around the area if you were wanting a place to sit down and rest for a bit. There were plenty of people so it was quite lively. It was a really enjoyable experience and came back a couple of times to just look around, shop and eat."
2526,5.0,"its a shopping area but sometimes it gets crowded, you can also find restaurants there or you could try the street food"
2527,5.0,You can find a lot of street food and cosmetics in there. Full of people! Fantastic actions are everywhere!
2528,5.0,One of the center of city’s business area. Heaven for fashion and clothing lovers. Food places everywhere and food are considerably cheaper and tasty. Walking distance from Seoul Tower. Easy access from anywhere in Seoul via Metro and busses.
2529,4.0,"Instagram @oppakuliner  The best night market here i guess, i spend my 3-5 hours here to eat some great foods (their gingseng soup and chicken are so good) and accompany my friend to buy a lot of cosmetics. The crowded can be handle because the place is so spacious"
2530,3.0,"The street is super crowded. Be prepared with many people pushing you around. The street food is very expensive. We recommend you to eat at some proper restaurants rather than having street food.  It is a great place for shoppaholic. You can find many great items from cosmetics to skincare, clothes to contact lenses, souvenirs to jewellery in this street."
2531,3.0,"This is a place that has everything for shopping - even a Cat Cafe. It is certainly busier at night, so be prepared for the crowds."
2532,5.0,"this is the shopping haven of all shoppers! everything is cheaper than those sold online - from shoes to cosmetics to clothing. everything is here. oh wait, did i mention FOOD? as you walk all three blocks of the district, you'd always get hungry. so whenever you go, wherever you look, there will always be food that will suit your taste. from lobsters, oysters, skewered beef steak or chicken, sweet and spicy chicken, fresh fruit drinks, and the infamous egg bread!! OMG all of you must try the egg bread. i can't describe it. it's just too good! ofcourse they have ice creams, and bingsu and all. they also have several restaurants and bars and cafe's (dessert and coffee cafe's) that will cater to your liking. everybody that goes to south korea always goes to myeongdong."
2533,5.0,"I love Myeongdong. It's super touristy, so don't go if you're looking for an authentic cultural experience. But if you love shopping and street food, this place is definitely for you."
2534,4.0,There’s never a boring moment here. A must visit - and visit over and over. Saw other parts of Seoul but this is the happening place.
2535,3.0,"Myeongdong is always a good location for tourists due to its proximity to city center, many shopping and restaurants, as well as plenty of money exchange with best price.  It is a paradise for girls/women as there are many skin care and fashion shops. The shops close late at night so there plenty of time for making choices.  The apparent good side is exactly its shortcomings. There is nothing else to do from shopping skin care. It is actually small and one can walk through every single alleys within one hour. If shopping skin care is not the ultimate purpose, Dongdaemun in fact has a design complex which adds a bit more cultural content. For vibrancy and youth culture, area around Hongik University is my first pick."
2536,4.0,must visit place for shopping especially cosmetics. cheap and so many discount here! bring your own bag here for shopping! for the streetfood i dont recommend this place cause its expensive and the taste just so so.
2537,3.0,"A bit touristy but you must experience it at least once. Beauty products, food an people everywhere! Shopper's paradise"
2538,5.0,"If you do not want to travel much for shopping, eat and money exchange, this is the BEST place to stay and go in Seoul!  Things might be a little pricey due to this is the most tourist population place but you can really get almost everything here.  There are lots of food to choose from as well. From street food, to restaurants...  As for money exchange, so far the best rate I found is the 大使馆 (As shown in my photo). It is located just in front of the ambassador where there are many police outside, so very safe as well. 😬  There are also shinsegae, young plaza and lotte department store opp the start of the long stretch of street food.  NOT TO BE MISSED! 🤩 The Line Friends store which holds the biggest Brown! (As shown in the photo)"
2539,4.0,"For those that absolutely need to do shopping whilst on holidays in Seoul, then this is definitely the place for you.  Don't worry, you're not alone since virtually every other foreign tourist out shopping is here too - yes, it gets very packed!"
2540,3.0,We passed through here by default whilst going from a to b. It was certainly lively If you are in to shopping site you would enjoy this area Some street food
2541,5.0,"Shopping haven, dont miss out the small groceries on the secret alleys you may want to check out their food souvenirs around."
2542,5.0,The best place where you can find all what you are looking for... starting from Korean beauty products to street food & clothes. I was lucky to have this market just on the other side of my hotel ‘Lotte Seoul’
2543,5.0,"The busiest market in Seoul (comparing to Insadong, Gwangjang, Itaewon, Namdaemun). Visited this market several times during my five days in Seoul. Myeongdong Shopping Street is the best place for make-up hunter, and popular brand products. Will be better to visit at night when the light envelopes the crowd. Very recommended."
2544,5.0,It is good to buy cosmetics from here. There are many popular brands and many choices of seller who offer discounts. The food is killer too. Would be here sometimes again
2545,4.0,"Busy shopping area near the center of Seoul. You can find good deals there. After 4pm, the street food venders come out. That is truly worthwhile."
2546,4.0,Filled with Korea cosmetic shops. All products are cheaper compared to Singapore also. They have different sales promotion like 1+1 / 2+2
2547,5.0,"You could spend pretty much all day here since there are so many shops, restaurants and cafes. The vendors start to set up shop around 4pm in the middle of the streets. That’s when it starts to get crowded and people are lining up for street food. My favorite was the lobster tail but you have to find the right person that takes his time to prepare the lobster tail and make it right. There were about 5 lobster tail stands spread throughout the shopping street. This place looks nice during the day as well as night. It’s less crowded during the day but you wouldn’t get as much street food as evening and it dies down around 9pm which is probably the best time to go to avoid the crowds but still get to try a little bit of each of their foods."
2548,5.0,"Food, clothes, cosmetics, music... there is everything! Around 6pm the streets start to be really full of people. Went there 3 times in 4 days!"
2549,4.0,It is a shopping paradise for shopaholics. However the streets food here are not cheap though. And basically you will keep passing by salesperson from the stall trying to you into their store by giving you freebies. Do not go in if you are not interested of the products and do not be enticed by the freebies. Cause they will only give you the freebies after you have bought something from the store. And the salesperson attitude will change 180 degree if you do not buy anything from them after entering.
2550,3.0,"This is really a place for skin care or cosmetic fans. A lot of the big brands have a handful of their shops scattered in each direction. There is a lot of street food available so it feels quite festive. We enjoyed watching the Nanta show at the UNESCO building. I wouldn’t recommend it for food or clothes. Lotte mall is nearby but prices are really steep. Cosmetics and skincare is good though, lots of discounts given, freebies and you are likely to find sales people who can speak English and Chinese. Do your research before going on what you want, not all shops have all products, just go in show the picture and if they don’t have it, they tell you immediately and you don’t waste time. For the same brand Clio, we bought two Kill Cover cushions in Myeongdong for much cheaper than a similar cushion we bought in Busan."
2551,3.0,lobster cheese krw15K。sweet potatoes at myeongdong food street selling @3k/piece vs at 7-11 krw1.7k.
2552,4.0,"Many cosmetics shop with very reasonable price. A must go place when you are in Seoul as we can try many local food as well. For muslims tourist, there are many Halal food stall along this street."
2553,4.0,During the day it is relatively quiet. You can easily stroll through the streets and browse in the shops. At night it becomes a street market with numerous food stalls and street sellers. Great atmosphere but super crowded.
2554,5.0,"Great atmosphere, friendly vendors, smaller than I expected but still great place to get gifts for ALL price ranges. Great deals all around!!!"
2555,4.0,"This places offers a lot and can be a one stop place if you like shopping for shoes and skin care products. At night, a lot of stalls come around, but their food is expensive! $3-$6 is expensive for street food, but well... had to try what they have because I want to a gastronomic adventure. If you are in a group, I suggest you go to restos around this area because their food is better abd you can comfortably sit and put your food on the table.  There are also a lot of other shops for shoes, clothes and beauty shops here and there.  Overall, this place is definitely a must visit. It's also near Namdaemun Market if you want to go. It's also packed with tourists btw and when the weather is cold, come to this place because there's a lot of people = heat. lol"
2556,5.0,"I really enjoyed this area for 2 reasons: a) great shopping for Korean cosmetics. the choice is amazing, and there discounts/offers/loads of free samples everywhere b) street food: really really yum. my favourites have been - chicken dishes and lobster with cheese  and finally, the vibe is very special also, stop by Line & Friends. huge brown teddy bear is very cute"
2557,5.0,This area was so lively. Everything is in it already. The shopping experience plus the best food in town and beauty products. Cheap and good and so clean. I fell inlove with this very busy street.

If you are willing to walk and explore this huge complex of shopping arena, you can find some good stuff from fashion, bags, and snacks/korean food. Its a mixed things you can found here. Just walk and enjoy the environment.  Try the local snack food, it is good and delicious."
2559,5.0,"Getting to Myeongdong Shopping Street is fairly easy, just get off the Myeongdong Station and any Exit will lead you to it, some nearer than the others but just look at the directions from the subway and you won't get lost!  You need to come here HUNGRY...my cousin and I strategically planned :) and that means, eating whatever we can on the first night then come back on the second until we have exhausted everything..well, guess what, we never did tasted everything, but I am sure we did abt 98%! What we did was buy one of each from stall and shared that way we're able to taste a lot in one go, we came back for the next 3 days and still wasn't enough. we keep coming back for some like the pastry shaped like fish and had red bean or sweet potato inside..so yummy!! the steak and veg was so good too! it's an experience and a real good one at that. one tip or maybe two:bring water and bring a bag for your rubbish. stalls doesn't always have bin bags and if you're like us who likes to walk whilst eating then dispose of your rubbish well.  Myeongdong just doesn't stop with the street food..it is littered with shops,,anything you want can be had here, most specially skin care...and don't just buy from one store, shop around coz you'll see some deals in one shop that you won't see in the next! and when you see it, buy it because going back is chaotic...there's so many shops of the same name and the streets are quite confusing most specially at night when a lot of people are roaming around!  Have good fun and eat plenty!!"
2560,5.0,"Definitely one of the best shopping and eating area in Seoul. You can find numerous shop here. And some cosmetic shop give customers free mask sheet to invite them into their store. Some good bargains can be found here.  There are many famous and traditional Korean restaurant here namely Kyoja, Sinseon Seolleotang, Hadongkwan...  However, I didn’t see any bar or pub here."
2561,5.0,The shopping street plus all the street food sold along this street made the area so unique. You can try the street food sold - they are quite tasty especially the bake sweet potatoes.  So many shops that sell souvenirs and beauty products. A good place to shop.
2562,5.0,"Myeongdong has everything from food to shopping. You'll find every possible thing for beauty and skincare routines, through all price ranges. The street food there is amazing.. a mix of sweet and savoury. It is the most lively during evening, around 6-7pm.. and most shops are open till 9 or post 9pm too. It was one of my favourite places in Seoul!"
2563,4.0,"Shop to your hearts content while taking in the sights of an amazing experience. A busy city with bustle and hustle all over, this area can provide you with cheap souvenirs to upmarket items that will tempt the hardiest shopper.

2579,5.0,"During a week in Seoul, every single day I visit this place.  During the day, you could find a lot of fashion shops in this area, not to mention the cosmetics shops. If you are a man, shopping with your female partner, hold her hand tightly. Or else she might go wild and spend all the money.  This place also has lots of local restaurant and snacks. By 17:00, the locals open more stalls. Most are traditional food. I insist not to leave the market until I try all of them. I gain at least three kg and have no regret at all.  The prices are all the same. A grilled lobster tail will cost you 15000 won, whether you buy it in front of the market, or far inside. They also have Oreo’ churros, grilled steak, ice cream with honeycomb, sweet potato, mixed seafood satay, strawberry mochi, twisted potato, and so on. Will be back for sure!"
2580,5.0,"I enjoyed Myeongdong area because I love eating and shopping. It’s a good place to find stuffs for yourself and your family. From branded items to local brands you can find it here. You can visit huge malls in the area particularly Lotte Department Store/Mall. You can also find souvenirs especially at the Underground shopping center. If you get hungry then it’s not a problem as well because there’s a lot of restaurant, coffee shops, food stalls, and a lot more to choose from. Everyone who’ve been there loves it and I’m sure you will too."
2581,4.0,This place has a lot of beauty shops around the area and branded shops. You can also enjoy the Korean street food which I really enjoyed and I recommend you should try. Try going around and see the prices before you buy. But I think all shops around offer good deals.
2582,4.0,"Myeong-dong is known for cosmetics, but there is all sorts of shopping available. In the evening, expect the area to be crowded with people walking around and food stalls. There are all sorts of options available. In addition to street level shopping, there are numerous shops underground. For those in need of glasses, you can have your eyes tested and glasses made in less than 15 minutes."
2583,5.0,"Loved the street food there. And girls enjoyed shopping cosmetics stuff, and they had good prices. Very bright and beautiful at night with all the colorful lights. Very safe. It was very close to Marriott at Nandamen."
2584,5.0,"This is a compulsory place to visit especially for a tourist to get a souvenir, best foods and various choices of cosmetic products. I manage to buy a bundle of face mask with a affordable price and I really enjoy the food there. The food was scrumptious and I can even asked for more. Will surely visit this place again."
2585,5.0,"Its a very busy place with local people and tourists but it is definitely worth a visit for the experience. The stores are the same as anywhere else, but there are some market stalls and in the evening lots of food stands to try (prices are reasonable and tend to be similar at different places selling the same thing). Take cash and be sure to have an empty belly!"
2586,5.0,This is the street of high fashion for everyone including fancy retail shop selling skincare and cosmetics.
2587,5.0,"Korean cosmetics are king in this area. Streets are dotted with shops selling every sheet mask, treatment and moisturizer imaginable. People hand out mask packs to try to entice you into coming in. If street food is more up your alley Myeongdong is also your place with stands lining all the large streets. Cars and motorbikes can travel through here with little regard to pedestrians so be careful walking. Tourist police walk around this area so help is typically not too far away. Many restaurants here are tucked away above street level so they can be a bit difficult to find.This area has so many dining options it will be pretty hard to get bored."
2588,4.0,"Me and my sister were just having our time, looking at shops and walking near them. Suddenly a guy handed me free mask sample and pushed, literally PUSHED me inside his shop. It's not even a well-known brand to start with. Decided to buy the hand lotion because the salesgirl keep on following and talking in complete Korean and didn't even try to make us understand. After that, we walked in the middle of the street to avoid being hassled anymore. Other than that, Myeongdong is definitely the place for cosmetics, clothes and shoes. Recommended for young people, since the loud music and environment might not match with older people."
2589,3.0,"I have been there many times, so feel like this place is for Koreans who want to see many foreigners. If you want to feel Korean natural vibe, then this place is not for you, even though it is quite fun to visit this market."
2590,5.0,"Wild and crazy. Tons of lights, people, food, bars, action and SHOPPING! So much to do and see. It's packed with K-beauty products everywhere you turn. Much better at night than the day time."
2591,4.0,"Myeongdong will definitely be a place that you will return for their beauty products (mask, make up, lotions, beauty tools and etc) if you buy in bulk it will be cheaper and they always have promotion for all the brand there."

2594,5.0,"You dont go to Seoul without going to Myeongdong and experiencing it. What a dynamic place that is teeming with shoppers, tourists, vendors all seemingly at their most vibrant when in Myeongdong. The prices are reasonable and a whole range of stuff to buy. It is a widely known fact, in Myeongdong, one doesnt just get to bring home all the cosmetic goodies that one buys. You get loads of freebies as well."
2595,5.0,"Variety of street food (corn, spicy rice cake, fruit, etc.). Great place to buy socks, makeup, etc.."
2596,3.0,People are always busy pushing and nudging you in the streets also be prepared for pick pockets stealing from you because of the overgrowded streets The shops are great with all types of items to buy but they will follow behind you every ever you go in their shop and then force to sell you the item you are interested in
2597,5.0,"If you came to visit Seoul for the shopping, this is a must-see area for you. Shop til you drop and enjoy all the delicious street foods as well. Plenty of restaurants, souvenirs, and prime shopping stores that line the streets here. Glad there were a few Starbucks here since it was cold out and had a much needed coffee break to warm up. The Starbucks was 3 stories I believe so plenty of space to kick back and connect to wi-fi for a bit. While there are definitely some gents shopping available, the VAST majority of shopping you will find in Seoul will be women's fashion and cosmetics.

2601,5.0,"Wonderful street to check out. Lots of delicious street food in the evenings. If you love cosmetics/skin care, go crazy here! Do be warned about taking “free” samples though. Only do so if you’re ok with the shop keeper following around you and hard-selling you items for 5 mins. (I accidentally took 1 free facial mask at a shop and didn’t dare take anymore!) Other than that, the atmosphere for shopping and eating and soaking in the Seoul life is great! :D"

From shoes, clothes, K-Pop K-Star memorabilia and of course BEAUTY Products. Cosmetics Power Houses such as Face Shop, Etude and all over the place. Tip, if you find yourself falling in love with the prices offered in one Face Shop, hold yourself first and walk further, look for other Face Shops they might offer cheaper prices of their face masks and make-up. Same shop but offers different prices. What I love about this district is they offer plenty of samples for free to shoppers inside the shops and even on the street. This place is crowded but safe and clean. If you are a tourist, don't forget to bring your passports with you. The shops here offers discount to foreigners just present your passport."

2612,4.0,"This place is hopping all the time. Many street food vendors selling delicious foods-eggbread, sausages, spiral potatoes, dumplings, fruit smoothies. Good place to get souvenirs and facial snail masks and creams. There's a Cat Cafe and a Dog Cafe. I think the Meercat and Racoon cafes may also be nearby. It's shoulder to shoulder at times but a lot to look at and entertaining. Remember where you started so you don't get lost. One side of it ends at Namsam Seoul Tower."

2620,5.0,"If you’re not careful, you could break the bank on your first day. Myeongdong deserves at least 5 days of exploration if you are into shopping. The quality of the Korean clothing brand are awesome. You will need to do a lot of research with the skin care and cosmetics, though. Otherwise, you’ll end up buying everything you see. There are lots of restaurants to choose from or you can opt for street food. We were hungry all the time, so everything tasted awesome to us."
2621,5.0,"This place is my favorite because of the cheap korean cosmetics and products. Street foods were also worth the money. The street foods will start at around 4pm (it gets crowded). If you just want to shop, I suggest you come earlier to avoid the crowd."

2623,5.0,"At night, this place is lined with all type street food vendors, you can shop for garments, cosmetic, skin care products and all sort of things while food hunting. Other than street food, there are lots of restaurants as well, that's why i love this place. Try not to have the jajangmyeon from the street vendor, you can have a better one from Hong Kong Banjeom 0410 which is in Myeongdong as well.  Just in case you can't find the place you're looking for or you're lost, look for people in red/orange suits with ""!"" symbol on and they will be happy to guide you through."
2624,5.0,"Myeondong Shopping Street is a MUST place to visit where you can find everything from name brand clothing, make up, knock-off goods and some really good street food.  Excellent place to take the family for strolling around especially at night time."
2625,5.0,"We stumbled across this street because our hotel was around the corner and we found our selves coming back several times just to try all of the street foods. I would say in the late afternoon 4pm onwards the street vendors come out in droves and everything is delicious. Highly recommend the chicken and leek skewer, the fish shaped pastry stuffed with red beans(very sweet) and the grilled cheese with rice cakes. This street has many small bars and cafes on it as well as loads of shopping. Ladies this is the place to go for skin care, there are many stores dedicated to skin care here. Fun tip, they will give you a free face mask if you walk around the store for about 2 min. with no obligation to buy! You can not bargin on food prices here but can bargin on goods. Excellent way to spend the early evening."
2626,5.0,"There is alot of choice at this market and while not many there are some veggie/vegan options; roasted sweet potatoes, corn on the cob (grilled with flavor or plain/steamed), fruit cups, herbal teas, yaki noodles, deep fried 'tornado potato' and there is one stall- a young guy with three big soup kettles- bean/rice porridge, pumpkin porridge and veg porridge; these are really good! There is also a dumpling stall that has 3 options- veg, pork and kimchi, DO NOT EAT HERE. I asked for the vegetable ones, took one bite and tasted meat, I went back and asked her if they were vegetable and she said 'well they have a little bit of pork in'"

2637,4.0,Myeongdong in Seoul is one of the many streets in the city that instantly becomes a shoppers paradise as the sun sets in the horizon.  As the evening progresses so as the number of shoppers grew to astronomic proportions. It is a place to enjoy and satisty one’s craving for traditional food and shopping. You can see from the faces of the crowd the enthusiasm and eagerness to find the best piece of item they are looking for.  My friends and I arrived in that famous street one cold evening this February just in time to join the frenzy and excitement of the different nationalities of people walking and bargaining for the best available price all around the place.  It was exhausting but definitely exciting.
2638,5.0,The boutique sales cheap clothing and plenty of cosmetic to buy. There are plenty of restaurant to eat plus there is a food street to taste the local food.

2641,5.0,"Myeongdong is famous for its national brands and shopping centers as well as various food courts. You may find everything you need here varying from phone cases and souvenirs to face masks, clothes and electronics. Prices in the street shops usually decrease by the end of the day, so evening is the best time for some profitable shopping."
2642,3.0,Not so atracctive for me. Like other cities Seoul doesnt have only one shopping street. There many places u may shopping and may taste street food. But the Myeongdong is the best known
2643,5.0,"We chose to stay in Myeongdong for our first visit to Korea. Glad we did since there’s a ton of action here and everything else was close by as well. The shopping street had everything you could imagine, but prices were as expensive as they were in the states. There are tons of street food vendors, but none of them were truly that great."
2644,4.0,"We stayed at a hotel near Myeongdong, so we went to this street everyday. There were variety of shops in this area. At about 4.00 pm, they opened the stalls along the Myeong-dong 10-gil. There were a few halal stalls where Muslims can taste the local food. There were also a few halal restaurants in this area, but I think they were overpriced. Anyway, it is recommended to shopping during sales season. We got a lot of discounts plus tax refunds."
2645,5.0,Buzzing for most of the day. Don't expect any nightlife late on Friday though - it's dead. Otherwise plenty of shops and restaurants.

2648,3.0,"Why travel all the way to South Korea to see all the international stores that you probably have at home? Myeongdong is interesting as a cultural event, given that culture is how people live now and not just in the past, and the area is a people watchers delight, especially with the lively street food stalls. Lotte sells baseball boots for around $250, so watch, have a coffee, freeze (we are here in February!) and enjoy being part of a massive hive of activity, but keep your wallet or purse tightly shut!"
2649,4.0,"One of the busiest street in Seoul ...you can enjoy the amazing korean street food (tornedo potato,grilled shrimps,...) Very alive area and specially during night...great vibes and great people. Korean are really nice and friendly."
2650,3.0,It's a very high and lively area since morning till late at night. you can find alot of skincare brand and cosmetic along myeongdong area. But it seems to have same brand branches in the same area. The street foods are very expensive comparing to other places. We had taiyaki for krw2.000 while you can get it only krw 1.000 in other place. Not a good place for food hunting for sure but good for shopping.
2651,2.0,"We initially thought it was the bad cold weather caused the bad mood in their salesmen, but we finally agreed it was their attitude towards tourists needs to be improved.. if you are a tourist who wanted to buy something, but you ended up didnt buy anything be it due to their miscommunication eg language problem, or you didnt find what you want, they simply scold you..some of them really were bad tempered..u ll be surprised!!"
2652,5.0,"Almost a one stop shop, this place is wonderful to shop in or even stall-hop food tasting. We love being able to share small portions and trial our street vendors at this street. This street is super close to the myeong dong station and conveniently open til extremely late at night."

2654,5.0,Myeongdong is not my favorite. It is too crowded.. But it offers you so many foods you can try.. 😬 their pop up store is a thing
2655,5.0,"Absolutely a must see and do in Seoul. Make it a night. Eat on the street, shop for cosmetics, feel the vibe, get a fashion upgrade. Strictly an evening affair, the later the better. We thought the best market, a bit more upscale than the others. The most fun we had in a very great city."
2656,4.0,This market has a lot of different things to offer...ask at the tourist booth if looking for something special...also do not forget to check underground shops

2663,2.0,"I found this shopping area do have everything a typical tourist would need. However, I found their prices are way too expensive. You can definitely find the same items in other places: subways, student districts, even other lesser known tourist area. As for the food stands - they do have any choices; but mostly cater to Chinese tourist."
2664,4.0,"The street is lined-up with Seoul's street food. By the time you visited the whole area, you will find yourself full with all the hard-to-resist food being offered. Oh and you get your fill of fashion and cosmetics. Definitely a place to visit again."

2667,5.0,"Myeongdong is every shopper's must visit in Seoul. Almost (if not all) can be bought here. Cosmetics, clothing, shoes, all things KPOP, for those with limited time, shopping in Myeongdong will already get you far. All cosmetic brands are here, stores for clothing for signature as well as reasonable options are also everywhere. Personally, I enjoyed shopping and going around in the evening since so many food stalls are set up for the evening market. This gets the shopping crowd really going and it can get very crowded with lots of tourists and shoppers everywhere making the experience even more interesting.  After a long and tiring exploration of the sidestreets, it's good to relax in the restos or cafes that are just as numerous as the retail outlets or sample some street food along the main street."
2668,3.0,"Anyone who loves Korean cosmetic know this place, a lot of blog mentioning them as beauty street in Seoul. Nice place for sightseeing and quite lively.  But we have bad experience shopping here. The staff greet me in English (she also can speak Chinese with other staff) so i explain what I want, but she didn't listen what I said and rude ! She even mumbling 'whatever' in Korean when she pick the wrong product (she think I didn't know simple Korean eh?)  Next store are not much different. Compared with other tourist who bring big suitcase & buy bunch of product, we shop only for our personal stash. Why treat us differently? And again I get nasty treatment from staff who can speak (mostly Chinese speaker). So we just grab what we want, not even bother to try then leave asap ! Then i learned from friends that they're not Korean,...hmm Ow-kay ~ The Korean staff are nicer, not rush you when we test the product, but they not speaks English well. Still, i prefer to be served by them.  Advice : For shopping peacefully, better go to another store chain such as at Ewha Women University, or anywhere but here, some stores are bigger and friendlier."

This is the place to get your cosmetics, and some shops also offer on-the-spot tax refund, no need to do so at the airport.

I dont think it was the biggest one but it believe it had the most choices of stalls and branded boutiques in all the shopping streets we visited so it was quite crowded.

The Young Olive there is big (two-storeys), with lots of stuff from moisturisers, face masks, cosmetics, hair & beauty products, and even a cafe upstairs. I wished I came here on my own instead of with my 2 kids!"
2708,5.0,"The street food and surroundings are cleaner than other shopping streets I've been to. There were countless beauty and apparel stores. Heck, even the street vendors sold clothes. You'll find plenty of restaurants and branded Korean and foreign goods.  We came here to watch a popular tourist show called Nanta. Since it's a dance comedy, you don't need to understand the language to understand most of it. Pro tip: book the show yourself to get discounts. Don't go to the tour agencies. Heck, for a promo, I got a premium adult seat and the whole thing was 1,000 won cheaper (69k) WITH a gift box that without a gift box (70k). Minors can get discounts if they bring their passports or an equivalent ID.  This street is a few mins walk by train. One of the nearby bus stops is near the largest Uniqlo in Korea. As a foreigner, you can get by on commuting using Google Maps (for bus & train), the Korea Subway app, and a T-money card with load. You can get a T-money card at a convenience store or the airport. For walking or driving directions, the Waze app can help  We went during winter so some of the alleys were really cold when the wind came. I suggest bringing cold protection for your face if you're weak to that."
2709,5.0,Lotsa shopping for fashion and stuff. Ample street food along the way and mini marts to stock up your fridge. Bustling crowds and its is safe and welcoming.
2710,5.0,"Superb Shopping location especially during Christmas. Lots of great deals up for grabs! The place is fun filled with many activities. There was a night where we saw a few locals holding up signs which says ""Free Hugs"", how Christmas spirits should be :). What's more the ever famous Nanta show is located here. Definitely a superb place to visit."
2711,5.0,"We stayed opposite Myeongdong Street and every night, we would be walking the streets enjoying the snacks. Surprisingly, I find it is cheaper to buy some stuff in the underground shopping than on the streets."
2712,5.0,"This is a shopping area for ladies. They can enjoy great discount. Almost all branding has a branch at here. However, the tasty of food just so so, no matter shop or street food. Suggest traveler just shopping here and go to any place for traditional foods, such as City Hall etc."
2713,4.0,"The place was lively both in the day and at night, with a good atmosphere. There was a wide variety of food options (porridge, barbequed meat, chicken soup, noodles, street food etc.) and products (although mainly cosmetics and clothes based). There were quite a few shops with open wifi networks which allowed us to access the internet easily. Do take note that many shops offer instant tax refunds (but you need to spend a minimum amount first). So, do remember to 1. Bring your passports 2. Check how much the minimum spend is (in our experience it was 30,000KRW)."
2714,5.0,"This is the place you dream to be in if you're a natural shopper and a foodie! The street can be full of people especially at night and it's so easy to get lost but no worries! There's a police station at the centre and tourist information just beside Boots and Olive young (the biggest one). There are also many banks here like Woori, Shinhan, and Standard Charter. There's also wide array of money exchange. We usually go to the one right across from the biggest Olive young store or to the one near the Chinese primary school.  So many stores shoving their free masks to you while you walk BUT don't ignore it! It's your chance to try their mask and you there's a possibly that you'll love it and buy some more!  And go try the local foods! Most of them are unusual for me but there are some that I loved!  ENJOY MYEONG-DONG!! I sure did!"
2715,5.0,"This place has the most shops from foods, clothing, cosmetics, electronics and entertainments. The street foods have many varieties and the Koren cosmetics are reasonable priced. The best place to shop in Korea."

2717,5.0,A must go place to go. Unlimited abundances of shopping. Unlimited abundances of food. Unlimited abundances of tourists. A place not to be miss!!!
2718,4.0,"Being to Korea for the third time and this is a place we will not miss out. A place with tons of cosmetic retail shops, restaurants and street food. Over the years, prices of the street food increase tremendously. I will recommend more on patronising little restaurants serving variety of great food along the streets which is more worth it. If you love this place. You can choose to stay in one of the hotels there. As it is very centralised in the heart of Seoul."
2719,5.0,Best place to try korean street food . Happening place to be with lots of things to shop . Definitely will not leave myeongdong empty handed.

2721,5.0,"Rows upon rows of Korean cosmetics shops. Plenty of clothes shops too. You can shop your heart out here and when you go hungry, there are also plenty of restaurants nearby. At night there are food carts which add to the lively vibe of this district.  When shopping for cosmetics, do compare prices even between the same brands. Most brands have multiple branches in this district and some are even opposite each other. Some branches have deeper discounts than the others so look around before purchasing anything."
2722,5.0,"Wow - loved shopping here! There is something for every one. I felt very safe and there were couples, solo people and families all having s great time. Just a block away from Myeong-dong train station so easy to find."
2723,5.0,"You could get lost in Myeongdong, there are rows and rows of streets lined with shops. Myeongdong is also host to amazing + cheap street food (I've tried the crisps on a stick and the ice cream that's about 2 feet long), but make sure you go in the evenings for the food."
2724,4.0,Its a good shopping area. Many shops for Korean cosmetics can be seen here. There are lot’s of other stores too for shopping.  Lot’s of street food stalls can be seen. One can enjoy all kinds of Korean food here. It is a very crowded & lively street.
2725,5.0,Walked along the streets. A must visit location. Good streets food. However quite expensive. Clean area. Full of cosmetics shops and most of the time pack with visitors
2726,5.0,"We stayed in the Myeondong area and selected out hotel based on the proximity to all the K Beauty shops. You will find at least one store front for every brand you desire. Also, Lotte Duty Free and Shinsegae Duty Free are here as well.  At night there are stalls and stalls selling street food. It gets so crowded you can barely walk. I didn't like the cars being able to access the same road. I wished they would make it pedestrian only."
2727,5.0,"Ideal place to stay. Food, shopping all in the same place. Kyoja, BBQ, fried chicken, ginseng chicken.. Making me hungry again."
2728,3.0,"Myeongdong is well-known for its street food and shopping and we were keen to experience what is unique about street food and shopping in Seoul.  There was no shortage of: - restaurants (chimaek, bingsu and otherwise ... cheese hot pot anyone?), - street food stalls (selling the same food items, what turned us off were the dumplings which was bulk-packaged more so that the touristy prices), - cosmetic shops (if you miss one brand, fret not, there are potentially a few more down the street) - souvenir shops (whether its S.Korean snacks, life products or clothing/apparel)  Despite the atmosphere and abundance of what was stated above, it felt somewhat materialistic and unoriginal compared to other shopping streets in Seoul. Perhaps come for a quick stroll otherwise there are better areas to explore in Seoul that are also friendlier on the wallet."
2729,5.0,"Myeongdong is perfect if you're looking for good places to shop and eat til you drop! It's especially great if you're into kpop as they have an abundance of shops rammed with kpop cds and merchandise. Food is reasonably priced, and street food is delicious! The cathedral is also worth checking out. There's a great vibe in the area, and the shopping centers are also lively and great for high end goods :)"
2730,4.0,"If you are not in for cosmetic, you can give this place a miss. Otherwise, it is an great place for shoppers with everything in a street."
2731,5.0,The place to go for all facial products you need! You can of course get it elsewhere too but it's a hotpot of all the brands you will know of.
2732,5.0,"You can find everything in this shopping paradise, but wait for around 4 pm when the food stalls open and taste a variety of fantastic Korean Street food!"
2733,3.0,"Great place, especially at night if you don't mind tons of people. Used to be so much better, still have memories of good old Myongdong. Now it's flooded with tourists and locals, shops are mostly Korean cosmetics (Etude House, Nature Republic, Skin Food, etc.) and popular international brands, not so much of Korean clothing or accessories. Street food is hugely overpriced. Again, the main problem is that it's too popular and too crowded at night. Daytime, it looks like any other street in a Korean city."
2734,5.0,"This is basically where you can do all of your shopping at. There are so many shops selling skincare, masks and cosmetics but the crowds make this place a little too overwhelming at times. As it was snowing in December, the ground was very wet and slippery so it was a bit cumbersome having to watch out for dried ice on the ground. The atmosphere was nice on the whole but you would have to take care not to overspend here."
2735,3.0,"The entire street is packed with the bigger Korean brands that makes it very easy to grab souvenirs for friends back home. A lot of service staff here are Chinese, so language-wise, apart from Korean this is an alternative. Very crowded and touristy though, don't expect to come here to experience the ""real"" Seoul!"
2736,2.0,"Was there on 18th Dec to look for gift packs. Sales personnel was not interested to entertain questions on products. They were eyeing customers buying in bulk and did not bother to give samples due to sales period. One shop even attempted to keep the special gift packaging for the products i bought. When i insisted on it, got is reluctantly Streets were packed and the little one got hit by back packs a few times. Street vendors were pricey.... KW3,000 for a small baked potatoe! Sales personnel at Hongdae was more pleasant and have the time to explain product details and happy to give sample."
2737,4.0,"Highly recommended for a snapshot of the food and shopping choices that Seoul offers. There are food carts, local food restaurants and lots of international choices eg Nepal  There is also a wide range of shopping choices, from the really inexpensive to the end.

You can grab any foods, snacks as you like. There are some good restaurants and Bar for groups of people. A good time to visit is from 17.30-21.00pm."
2746,5.0,"Great great great. But if u come in winter all are winter clothes. Because i come from a tropical country, i didn’t shop for clothings but other things else.. A must GO!"

2748,3.0,"For sure there's tons and tons of places for you to shop for yout skincare requirements. There's a huge Olive Young where you can get almost everything you need there, as well as Boots. Some shops will treat you better than others, and most shop assistants would be able to converse in Chinese or Japanese but very very little English. Usually if I need to buy stuff, I'd come early, like 10am or 11am, when it is less crowded. 4pm onwards, and the people starts coming in droves. Food options are aplenty, but I feel the food is bit overpriced and underwhelming in the two shops we tried. The small Cafe's are pretty worth a visit though."
2749,4.0,"Great for Skincare and Cosmetic Shopping! You can find any make-up/ mask you want in the area and it is much cheaper! Street Food was overpriced compared to other areas, and the taste was only mediocre."

2761,4.0,"I don’t usually like shopping streets. Shopping is not in my DNA.  Myeondong Shopping Street was for me more of an eating street with plenty of roadside stalls, than shops.  I tried the lobster - nothing fabulous. Can skip.  Egg bun was delicious!  Children found the sausages too peppery.  Strawberries were incredibly sweet.  But I had to say that my spirits were dampened by the sight of a disabled man crawling on the streets. It was a pitiful sight and I wonder why there weren’t more people who donated?"
2762,5.0,"This is THE MOST happening place in all of Seoul, where crowds in their thousands, local and tourists, throng the area picking up goods, cosmetics, street food etc. Your senses will explode with the vibrant music emanating from the various shops you pass by. Do note though, that street food prices aren't exactly cheap vis-a-vis what you can get at the restaurants, but hey, you are in Myeongdong, so just do it!"
2763,4.0,"This is the place to come if you want to feel the hustle and bustle of the city! Lots of facial masks, clothing, roadside food stalls around here."
2764,5.0,"My daughter loves the area, I don't mind it either... Always vibrant and fun with some interesting street food. The restaurants in the area are hit and miss, so I have stopped eating there and move on to get food."
2765,5.0,"I think Myeongdong offers a bit of everything; exciting, varied stores, the cultural, beautiful cathedral and entertainment galore. Shopping options are endless from the big brands to lovely small iconic individual stores. You can buy any electrical or clothing or handmade item along tyese streets and of course makeup."
2766,5.0,Fun shopping place. A lot of activities going on but we went mostly toward evening time. So not sure if it’s the same during the day. Street food. Lots of beauty and cosmetic brands can be found. There are restaurants and also cat and dog cafes to keep the young ones entertained. But dog cafe will only allow older kids (8 and above) to enter. We had a lot of fun.
2767,4.0,We like the green coffee house. Shopping is nice and fun but clothes is not cheap in Korea. We had fun.
2768,5.0,one of the best must go to places in Seoul! merchandise abound as well as street food of all sorts from lobster to shrimps to scallops!!!! the choices are endless! go there when your hungry and carry lots of money!!!! ill be coming back soon!!!!

2770,4.0,"This place is rather suited for Japanese and especially Chinese tourists, with cantonese menus and signs in the street. Street foods are nice and fun, but the price is relatively very high and they don't accept credit card payments. Still a fun place to visit."
2771,5.0,"For those who are into shopping, Myeongdong is perfect for you! From cosmetics and make up to garments and apparels, you can get it in Myeongdong. The prices are from cheap to okay, but you can haggle, except maybe on cosmetics and beauty boutiques, but they always go on sale. 😊 you can also find some tasty street foods around."
2772,5.0,"When we visited Korea last Oct I browsed thru the internet about the best area to book a hotel and Myeongdong is on top of the list. Yes it exceeded my expectations. Not only the neighborhood is alive, everything is there - from traditional Korean restaurants, bars and most specially street foods to the hundreds of make-up stores, clothes, shoes, food and accessories that you could only get in Korea. What more a lot of sales are at stake when you visit this bustling street. We were there on the Golden Week and it's a public holiday in Korea but Myeongdong is an exemption although there are stores closed a lot are very open and people from all over Korea are there eating, drinking and shopping. The street is also very safe but just be ready to squeeze in to heavy crowd. You could also Myeongdong via one of Korea's largest station - Myeongdong Station. Just FYI if you need disability access need to locate the Elevator so this station is not readily accessible - a lot of stairs and escalators and not frequent. In the station itself there are a lot of food stalls and shops to buy at your own covenience. The street also connects to Namsan Park where the famous N Seoul Tower is located as well as the enchanting and holy Myeong-dong Cathedral. Our hotel is located near the Namsan Park exit of Myeong-dong in the Seoul Animation Center. Another tip is the walking so better prepare your feet for a good sightseeing. Truly I enjoyed my stay here so it's definitely worth a visit!!!"
2773,4.0,Lots and lots of facial product stores to check out. Get free facial masks that are given out as free samples. Many food stalls selling all kinds of local delicacies. Many restos also to choose from. Must visit when in Seoul.

2775,4.0,"Nice street to walk down and do some shopping. Some of the cafes and restaurants are pretty good and are good value. Check out the Myeongdong Koja. It's really good value/proportion noodles. Street food was also fun to try. I liked the deepfried fish cake covered sausage/cheese, etc. stall. Not much shopping for guys. Nice place for women and couples. Ther're some neat shops to check out though so I wasn't bored. Just don't expect to buy too much as a guy."
2776,4.0,Happening street every night. A lot of street food and restaurants. Must visit this place if you visit seoul.
2777,4.0,"It is nice street to sight seeing and purchase fashionable items. There are many shops that build closely one another.  Its ""make-up"" paradise for girls and women. Less option for Men.."
2778,5.0,"Many nice shops, but beware of all the people! In the evening the streets turn into food truck-Mecca with many nice flavors."
2779,3.0,Lots of big department stores and small stores too! Most are selling beauty products which is not my thing. Great street food all around and had fun trying most of them too.

2782,5.0,"Shop till your arms break! The skincare and cosmetics are definitely the cheaper than anywhere else! Buy your cutie socks here as well! 10 pairs and 1 free for 1000 won.  As for skincare ans cosmetics, you notice they repeats after awhile. But NOTE! Not all same brand has the same offer. Some do not provide on the spot VAT and some hace their own in house promotion.. So if you think it is cheap just get it first. Also try to look for shops that does VAT on the spot to save you the trouble to go to airport and do the VAT.  Hope it helps and have fun shopping!"
2783,5.0,"Great atmosphere and choices! We had the glass noodles, spicy rice cakes, sweet potatoe, fermented honey and nuts and more noodles! Something for everyone!"
2784,5.0,"You cannot go to Myeongdong and not visit its famous shopping street. It's lined up with lots of boutiques and restaurants. Tourists and locals alike flock the area. There are also lots of good street food but watch out, prices of a quick bite easily stack up and you'll usually find eating in a restaurant instead is cheaper.  When buying cosmetics, I suggest to buy in bulk so you can take advantage of the tax refund."
2785,4.0,"Nice place to browse and shop, street food here is excellent, many bars and restaurants also available. Clothing prices often the same in different shops, reasonable selection of international brands."
2786,4.0,"This is where the tourist pulse in Seoul beats the hardest. And why not, it has everything. Walking distance to some of the city’s attractions like Deoksugung palace and Namsan Tower.

2789,2.0,"Interesting to see, but not for me. Loud, touristy, expensive (at least the street food), cramped. If you like shopping and kpop merchandise, you may like this!"
2790,4.0,This shopping area was good. It had lots of skin care stores and many large retail chains. Insadong had more boutique and art shopping. Myeongdong had unbelievable food vendors come out at night. It was fun to try all the food. If you are looking for the famous Korean skin care products this is your place for sure!
2791,4.0,"If you want a touch of home for the day while staying in Seoul this is the place to go. When I mean home , a little American enclave as practically every store you would find at a mall back home is in this shopping area. Also, there are plenty of eating options if you are tired of eating local food. That being said , there are still lots of great local restaurants and street vendors to fill up on while shopping."
2792,5.0,This street is filled with tourists. There are many street food stalls and also many restaurants around this area. There are many shops selling cosmetics products at affordable prices.  I would think this is a Must visit for any tourist for its food and shopping.  Interestingly we cannot find a good souvenir shop for the basic memory keepsake which a common tourist would buy.  Highly recommend: A street where you will be spoilt for choice of food.
2793,4.0,lot of people .. kk nice sercvice and lot of shops . everything i can find from here . really good place for travelers . ♡
2794,2.0,It was so many store and people. Price is expensive compare to other places in Korea. You can get cheaper price for the same product in other places. Overrated.
2795,5.0,"The sights, smells, sound. It truly is an essential fabric of any visit to Seoul and would strongly recommend for anyone. Food is amazing quality, and obviously cosmetic stores are everywhere. Make sure you have Won though!"
2796,4.0,"I suppose this is the tourist go-to place for everyone. Tons of shops, bars and food options. Should visit here if you in Seoul for the first or second time. Other than that, it gets a bit boring and repetitive."
2797,5.0,"You just don't get the Myeongdong vibe like you do here compared to the Western world. The lights, the street foods, free samples and the hundreds of people just give of a different and unique shopping experience. Definitely a must visit place when in Seoul"
2798,5.0,"Don't think it's only a shipping zone for Chinese people. There are lots of tourists destinations around. Nam San, Seoul city hall, cathedral, shinshaegae are all nearby. The surrounding area deserves at least two days walk."
2799,5.0,Great if you want to find a bargain in clothes and accessories. Many shops selling cheap clothes from children to adult. Many nice uncles and aunties selling stuff. Some shops even open until night time as in 1am 2am. So much fun!
2800,3.0,"It's a heaven for fashions and skin care products lovers. You can find almost all the Korean brand products here. We realized that the stuff Myeongdong are more expensive compared with Hongdae and that's why we didn't do any splurging here. As for foods there are a lot of choices, ranging from street foods to restaurants but again it's a bit pricey."
2801,5.0,"If nothing else, come to Myeongdong for the street food. Walk through the streets and try them all!! If you are interested, try entering shops and they might give you free stuff. Just take them :)"
2802,4.0,"If you are fond of street food, shopping and night strolls in busy markets, this is the place for you. Street food in Seoul has its own charm, it's not exactly cheap as compared to street food in Europe or US, but it's worth trying. Also being a vegetarian you will have decent options to choose from. If you love seafood, try the butter garlic shrimps here. You can easily spot some unique food stalls that can startle you with the food stall owner showing off his speed skills."
2803,4.0,For both expensive and affordable (underground market) for shopping. CDs/socks/memorabilia of your fave actors you'll find it here. Street food stalls open after 3pm/4pm. Too quiet in the morning.
2804,5.0,"I absolutely love this place, it really comes alive after 14h (after the food stands have settled). Most of the stores have promoter with free samples to lure you inside, and have sales girls fluent in English and Chinese. Every weekend (Fri-Sun), most of the stores will have additional sales, so even though it will be swarmed, during the weekends you'll score the best deals. During my shopping, my boyfriend enjoyed himself with eating from all the nice food stands.  Exit 2 of Myeong-dong station now also has a 8-floor Daiso, ideal for your gadgets, souvenirs and gifts."
2805,4.0,"plenty of cheap things to shop for. there's a variety of cosmetic or skin care products, clothes, socks, shoes, souvenir items, etc. but its the street food that i get to love. i should say its a must visit place for tourists especially during night time. a lot of money changers in the area too. near bus stops and the Myeongdong Cathedral."
2806,4.0,"A heaven for makeup junkie or k-beauty lover out there!

There is also famous LINE shop with cute giant bears for photos. It closes ar 10.00pm ."
2810,5.0,"This is the happening place for tourist especially starting around 6pm onwards with the lights on.  Since the Chinese started coming around 3-4 years ago, street food options have multiplied. From the traditional fish cakes, dried squids,roasted chestnuts and corns to the more upscale grilled lobster, shrimp and scallops .....  In addition to the name brand cosmetic stores, there are lots of side street with hats, clothings, handbags, accessories, etc at cheap prices. It is worth coming late afternoon to shop and snack your way up the Main Street in Myeongdong.  Tips: don’t come too late. Vendors start to leave around 10ish. Best time to come is 4pm-9pm."
2811,5.0,"Good place to shop for K- Cosmetics, and they give Tax Refund Discount for any cosmetics you buy in that area. Crowded good street food, Try Galbi if you are meat lover. They have few souvenir shops too. Go to the alleys for more shops and restaurants. Its open till 10.30 pm at night where as the department stores close at 20:00 hrs."
2812,4.0,"It gets crowded in the evening when the street vendors start setting up stalls. That's when the street came alive.  Plenty of shopping opportunities if you like clothes and Korean skincare/cosmetic products. Check-out Innisfree, Misha, Faceshop especially... Great and affordable products! Too many food options to choose from at night. Just amazing!  We stayed at Aloft Holel Myeongdong which is less than 5 minutes walk away. Super convenient."
2813,4.0,"A very heavy tourist-populated place, the area is very accommodated to tourists having workers speak various languages (to some level of expertise).  Plenty of food options here - price is higher than the markets but I guess it attracts the tourists  Despite how packed it gets, I come here to shop as most places is immediate tax refund which I prefer - the tax refund at the airport can be tedious so having it being immediately done is A+"
2814,3.0,"Just street food that you can find in other streets. I bought a pollution mask with a smiley face on it for 5,000 won. That's about it."
2815,4.0,"There are so many options of street foods along Myeongdong. We walked along once just to see what there was! We tried the twisted potato, the 32cm ice cream and a few other things during our time in Seoul. Great for a quick bite."
2816,4.0,"This part of downtown Seoul is quite the best area for shopping, with up-market, mid range and basic shops, with even 7-Eleven shops thrown in for good measure! There are eating stalls everywhere along the streets, and restaurants galore, catering to every taste. An absolute 'must' if visiting Seoul."
2817,5.0,a very happening area with numerous shops as well as stalls selling street food. A very lively neighbourhood and worth going just to experience the surroundings even if one has no intention to shop
2818,5.0,"Myeongdong is the best place to stay if you want access to street food and beauty road side shops till 11pm. Lots of restaurants too. Love the crowd, the vibe and interesting things to see. The area for people watching!"
2819,3.0,"I stayed in Myeongdong neighborhood because I was told it is the best in Seoul but I strongly disagree with that.  Myeongdong wasn't that good for me, I prefer Hondae, Ewha university street, Insadong, and Itaewon than it, why? Because it's terribly crowded and dirty, I mean yeah I expected it to be crowded but to a certain degree.  I couldn't eat in the restaurants there, I got disgusted by them honestly, I visited cats and dogs cafes there but when I saw the similar cafes in Hondae I really wished that I didn't do it in Myeongdong.  Seoul is a crowded city in general but my point is, I hated that only in Myeongdong shopping street."
2820,4.0,"The whole area and side streets are full of high end shops, restaurants, cosmetic stores, food street vendor. At night the food vendor experience is truly amazing, not only in flavours but also in optics. Food presentation is amazing and makes one want to try everything."
2821,5.0,"There are plenty of shops here and the area seems very safe/clean. Great atmosphere, but the most impressive thing was all the street food stalls that popped up at about 16.00 ish. Such an impressive array of high quality street food. Must have went to 7 different stalls in 1 go. Watch out though, there is room for bartering as they seem to up the price if they see u are foreign. Amazing food and very pleasant people. A must visit for the food alone."
2822,5.0,"Myeong-dong is one of the primary shopping districts in Seoul. The two main streets meet in the center of the block with one beginning from Myeong-dong Subway Station (Seoul Subway Line No. 4) and the other from Lotte Department Store at Euljiro. Many brand name shops and department stores line the streets and alleys. Common products for sale include clothes, shoes, and accessories. Unlike Namdaemun or Dongdaemun, many designer brands are sold in Myeong-dong. In addition, several major department stores have branches here, including Lotte Department Store, Shinsegae Department Store, Myeong-dong Migliore, Noon Square and M Plaza. The department stores carry many premium labels and other fashionable goods at reasonable prices. A must see in Seoul."

2825,4.0,"This has got to be the cosmetic capital of Seoul. There are literally hundreds of beauty shops (many of the same) located throughout the area which can be confusing especially when you're lost. Lookout for the folks in RED are helpful guides who speak English who can point you in the right direction though. If you're Asian looking, the chaps outside the stores will try to speak Mandarin to you and lure you with their free samples. Do not resist the inevitable. Be careful that some areas have vehicular access. And try the street food. it's amazing."
2826,4.0,"My hotel was located about a 15 minute walk from Myeong-dong. It is one of the main shopping areas in Seoul.  There are two main streets – one from Myeongdong metro station (line 4) and the other from Fuljiro which meet at the centre.  The area is full of shops and restaurants, cafes and street food stalls.There are many shops selling cosmetics. This is the place to buy good quality cosmetics at reasonable prices. Branded designer goods are sold as well. I am always a bit wary of buying such goods at prices that are too good to be true.There is a big department store – Lotte Department store in this area. Prices for designer goods are more or less reasonable.  Myeongdong also has a number of good restaurants. In addition, there are fast food restaurants as well as eating places serving Korean, Japanese and Western cuisines. Many restaurants in Myeongdong specialize in kalguksu (noodle soup). You will also find banks, theatre and beauty and hair salons."
2827,5.0,"If you want to shop, go to myeongdong. If you want to eat streetfood, go to myeongdong.  Its a very lively place, there can be a big crowd in the evening. Still a must visit."
2828,2.0,This place is too touristy that prices are double or more than other places. Food and beauty products etc. are readily available outside this area too at a cheaper price.

2830,5.0,"Being a shopping trip of course, we have to do shopping!

Amidst them are street food vendors doing brisk business in evening hours .

2837,3.0,I LOVE SHOPPING and live in a big city in the uk but I could not cope with the amount of people and shops however I did find everything I needed. Also side note boots in Korea is so expensive £8 for something the costs me £1.50 at home lol
2838,5.0,"Best place to eat street food and one of the best place to shop for clothes, shoes, make-up, socks, etch"
2839,5.0,"You can probably call this as make-up or beautification heaven for women. Beauty shops in every corner, even with multiple branches for one store. Shopping for clothes, shoes and apparel can also be done here, but I would say, it has same price in the Philippines. So you should buy things that can't be found in the Philippines. The night food market is a different adventure in itself. You can taste all their street foods in this place, that will be you dinner already."
2840,4.0,We went at night and the streets were quite crowded but the experience was nice. You can find almost anything to buy!
2841,4.0,"The best way to have contacts with locals is walking down this main shopping street in the center of Seoul; here at least you will not see the classical shops you will find everywhere in Europe but all genuine shops where nearly everything is available, main things being ginseng and ... mobile phones of course."
2842,5.0,"As we stayed at a hotel less than 10 minutes away, we visited the shopping streets twice. The streets are hustling and bustling with lots of beauty stores, clothing stores and restaurants. We had BBQ, Korean dessert, then chicken and beer all in the same night. During the evenings there is also a small night market with some clothing vendors and mostly food vendors for a couple blocks. We loved walking around and people watching in the area."
2843,4.0,"Beware of stalls trying to rip off your $ though. Otherwise u will find all sort of food, shoes, fashion staff here. Must see place when u visit seoul"
2844,3.0,"Myeongdong market street is the ultimate tourist trap in Seoul. Nothing is cheap here. But go to the backstreets and you may find some steals. Nothing compare to Hongdae prices however. Nonetheless, people still shop here for the experience that makes Myeongdong as a must go place in Seoul."
2845,3.0,"If you like to see the crowd, this is the place. Shops are thd same for every corner. You can try street food in the evening."
2846,4.0,Street food is undefeated! Shopping is great. Watch out for the pharmacies! They will scam you! I purchased medicine that is by prescription ONLY in the USA from the pharmacies here. They are scam products. They don't work. I wouldn't purchase any products from the pharmacies in the airport either.
2847,3.0,This shopping area is great for street food and skin care products but not too much else. They have several stores on the streets that are just repeated throughout the section.
2848,3.0,As Seoul's markets go it's OK but not great. Many beauty products with street food and clothes and shoes. Other markets are better but if close to your hotel it's worth a visit at night.
2849,5.0,I shop at myeongdong almost every night for 5 nights. From fashion to skin care to food. I can get almost everything I want here. Especially lots of free gifts for skin products. Love this place sooooooooo much
2850,4.0,"This is a good place to visit, especially if you like shopping and eating and to be around lot of people. Like in many areas of Seoul there is a great design all around and if you like this area at daytime you probably like it even more at dusk. The merchandise and prices? - I do not know, did no buy much except for something to eat."
2851,3.0,This is just another shopping street with the big box stores. Nothing too special unless you are specifically going for shopping.
2852,4.0,"Myeongdong area has lots of shops, about half cosmetics, quarter clothing, the rest are various other shops and restaurants. Everything is very close together, so you can comparison shop.  The area comes alive in the evening and at night, as street vendors setup along the streets. The merchandise is standard night market fare, cheap trinkets and such. You will probably find better prices and selection at the Namdaemun market right next door, during the day, but much more crowded, rustic, and with less English.  There are also street food vendors that setup at night, if you want to sample some portable local bite sized fare."
2853,4.0,"My hotel was right here so the street food was most convenient. It seemed to be the most touristy area and thus most expensive. They seemed to have more touristy foods like the chicken skewers, meat balls, fried chicken pieces along with some of the more traditional things. I think I liked the chicken skewers the most here. Go elsewhere if you are looking for more traditional stuff or cheaper food."
2854,3.0,"Good: Tons of skincare and cosmetics choices Restaurants, coffee, and Street food galore.  Bad: Wall to wall people at night. Noisy Free for all for both pedestrians and traffic  Depending on your personality, you'll either enjoy the lively atmosphere or hate the crowds and chaos."
2855,4.0,"We stayed nearby so we visited the shopping/food street almost every night during our 5D4N stay. There are plenty of food stalls available starting noon till evening, so plenty of choices to try out.  If one is not keen of street food, there are also plenty of highly recommended sit-in restaurants. Do a general search on Myeongdong best food to fish a few restaurants in the area.  The place could feel like a maze and sometimes every street could get rather crowded during peak hours.  Nevertheless, it's a definitely a place to check out if you are in the area. It's also easily accessible via subway.  There are also volunteers stationed at certain areas to help tourists with directions. They dress in red vests with various labels on so easily identifiable."
2856,4.0,"Myeondong has several shopping stores and vendors for all tastes and ages. The street food vendors offer a variety of quick, easy, and cheap eats. There are a few high end places if you're looking for a proper sit down. However, eating on the go is much more fun. A must see area if you're around."
2857,3.0,If you want to shop for brand nane clothes or cosmetics this is your area. Tons of shops big and small. Mix in a nice sampling of restaurants and you have it.
2858,5.0,"Very easy to walk around, has all the main shops that you would want to find in easy walkable distances and best part of it is that it simply has a great feel to it. On the weekend and many week nights the streets are filled with food vendors so it’s great fun walking around having a local snack and taking in the sights"
2859,4.0,"I'm not a big fan of shopping in the first place. It is fun to see the busy streets full of people, but for Americans, the goods are very expensive. I must say, Seoul is a beautiful and clean city. The people are respectful and very well mannered everywhere we have been. Even in the busy shopping district."
2860,5.0,Great food. Street food vendors Only starts at 2 pm. Good selection and speak enough English to get by. Worth waking around this market.
2861,3.0,"To be honest?!? Nothing special. You see these places,shops ect hundreds of times next to each other. They have the same stuff.. so really nothing special."
2862,5.0,I love to stay at Myeongdong area because I love to spend my night walking around the Myeongdong Shopping Street. Lots of street food you should try here. So many cosmetic shop to look at. Believe me you will enjoy its too. Enjoy shopping here.

2864,5.0,"Fantastic area to shop, loads of good price restaurants to find (try the side streets or look up to the higher levels) or just buy loads of tasty street food! Mix of international and Korean brand shops- some of them sooo cheap, lots of skincare, beauty and fashion options.Really busy and great atmosphere, worth a few visits while in Seoul- in the daytime and at night!"

2871,4.0,"This year i've visited South Korea second time. In this review, I'm gonna write about myeondong shopping street where has lot of modern brand stores and you can buy what suits you want. In this picture, i've with my friend who study in korea. We did shopping all day until we almost straved. There were crowded people to do shopping. After shopping, we ate korean cuisene that called samgebsel. They often drink some beer and soju(korean traditional alcohol) after eating meat. Of course, we followed their culture kkk. If you are planning to visit seoul, never ignore to do shopping at Myeondong. In my experience, it's gonna make you happy that doing shopping at all new brands street."
2872,4.0,This street is just full of excitement for a tourist who wants to shop or nibble on some fascinating snack's that is sold by the street hawkers. The shops are open till 10pm so you got plenty time.
2873,4.0,"Myeongdong is a maze of retail stores, restaurants, and hotels in Seoul. Well worth visiting as a tourist to wile away a few hours wandering around. Amongst the Korean stores there are many western brands including Boots, Starbucks etc., while the small restaurants offer an affordable way to taste the local cuisine."
2874,5.0,i went there 2 times; once in spring and then summer! better go in spring ah.. coz mosly the food are hot! but again so many cosmetic shop and local brand distro! definitely favourite place for those people who love to shopping and eat street food! once i try the crepes with my bf omg. taste like bomb with melted choco and banana as the topping
2875,4.0,"Myeongdong is actually 2 subway stations away from Seoul Station and we were told that the shopping was good there. We actually found Myeongdong Cathedral and it's bookstore even more interesting. Worth spending half a day walking the streets, it's really interesting."
2876,4.0,"The place to go to if you're into skincare shopping. Instant tax rebates free if you bring your your passport and buy above 30,000KRW. Nanta theatre is also located there. Very busy area. Sample some street food as well as quaint cafes. You can also find lots of currency exchange shops there. Tourist information centers can be found in several places. Many hotels as well."
2877,5.0,Many shops and restaurants open until 10 pm. Good place to spend time and look for best deals! Branded stores are also in the area. Bargain carts on the street like night market.
2878,5.0,"A very busy place with every imaginable shop. Loads of name brand shops, restaurants, coffee places and skin care shops. Very safe to visit at night"
2879,5.0,"FOOD: Street vendors come out in the afternoon to set up their stalls. There's a wide range of local street food here(which I noticed is more prominent in the night scene and not so much during the day) so there's bound to be something that will suit your taste. It is kinda weird how people flock to this place early in the evening and at around 11pm, this place becomes more like a ghost town. Yup, the stores close early. If you're planning to come here to drink, this is not the best place for that. Go to Itaewon. There is, however, a narrow street in this area with a strip of bars that stay open till dawn.  SHOPPING: Prices here are higher. I bought some socks near Ewha University for 1,000 krw each and was surprised to see the same kind in Myeongdong which were sold at 2,000 krw. Don't fall for the free samples. Store clerks would give them away to lure you inside the stores. Trust me, they really know what they're doing. Cosmetics and skincare products are cheaper here, since this place is where they come from. Lol. Look out for incredible deals especially those 50% discount and 1+1 promotions.  Overall, this place is not bad at all. As a tourist, I enjoyed the atmosphere here and would love to come back soon."
2880,1.0,"Do you want to buy a pair of Nike shoes, a cup of Starbucks coffee, or a can of Coca Cola at a 7 Eleven? If yes, this is a perfect place full of literally all local and global brands. This place used to be the only modern place 50~60 years ago, but now it is a place with terrible restaurants who rip you off. I would rather recommend you Gangnam, Garosugil, Anguk, Hyewha, and many other places."
2881,3.0,Here you can find local food and scene as well as an international flavor (shops). It's targeted to tourists and so it's mostly busy with people.
2882,5.0,"Definitely worth a stop if you are traveling to Seoul. I had delicious street food there and enjoyed just walking around and soaking in the ambiance, with many restaurants, shops, and bars to explore."
2883,5.0,"Street food Korean style! Shrimp on a stick, BBQ lobster tails, buttered scallops, saucy rice cakes, tornado potatoes, dumplings, fruit juices, Korean pancakes, and more .... so much choice, good prices, tasty food! 😋"
2884,4.0,"Famous for cosmetic shops, they are frequent and repetitive. Good street food options, look for the rose shaped ice cream and foot high cone. It seems like there are more deals than Gangnam, but not as good as Others."
2885,5.0,"Place to buy make up (woman things), many cafes and also restaurant. For muslims you can easily found halal food. In the night there's a lot of korean street food stall."
2886,4.0,"While I'm not into the shopping here, I do enjoy the street food vendors stationed at numerous locations throughout the area. You can find some great treats on sticks."
2887,3.0,The whole area caters to tourists. Most salesgirls are able to speak chinese and some can be pretty aggressive. They have repetitive brands almost at every turn of the corner. The street food are relatively more pricey too because its a touristy place. The streets get so crowded that you often have human traffic jams. I stay there so it gets quite frustrating on my way back to the hotel...
2888,4.0,"A street perfect for foodies and shoppers. Plenty of street stalls and even shophouses such as Yoogane and other KBBQ places. After having your lunch/dinner, you can continue to shop cheaply at innisfree etc and get your tourist tax refund. Remember to bring your passport along."
2889,5.0,The place is crowded and has plenty of food. There is also a mall nearby where you can buy groceries. It is a must-see place if you go to Seoul.
2890,3.0,"This place is really a haven for cosmetic-buff. If you intend to buy or looking for a good brand with discounts then this is the place for you. Other than that i would skip the place. Other stuff like streetfood and clothes etc are over-priced compared to other places like Insadong, namdaemun market and bukchon hanok village shops."
2891,3.0,Maybe I'm missing something but i don't understand the hype? This is simply another 'high street' in a different city/country. There is nothing unique. Its is extremely busy and to be frank offers nothing in the slightest bit unique...
2892,5.0,"It's a bit overwhelming to see several of your favorite Korean beauty stores along the area. But I guess that feeling adds to the charm of Myeongdong. Great food and shops along the way. The place is bustling but clean. The prices are generally the same in the beauty stores. But the promotions differ. So, if you see something that you think is of good value, better snatch it! The next store, although the same, may carry a different promotion!"
2893,5.0,Best place for cosmetic lovers and there is absolutely no language barrier at this place. There is at least 1 English or Mandarin speaker in the shops. Most stores give freebies to customers . A Must go!
2894,5.0,"We stayed right beside popular Myeongdong Street. Beside cosmetic products you can get local street foods, korean restaurant, apparels & some local stuffs. International brand such as Zara, H&M, Uniqlo, Forever 21 also available here.  This busy street still active untill 2030hrs everday. Lot of hotels along the street. However the stuffs bit pricy compare to others downtown at Seoul.  No issue on safety here, you can stroll the street safely, cctv almost everywhere."
2895,4.0,"Restaurants, cafes, street food, shoes, clothing, cosmetics and....people buying, eating, grouping... The place is lively always when I’ll be walking there."
2896,2.0,Things r expensive here but since the K Pop became famous Ppl flew to this place from allover just to CHECK IN into the cafes and some shops following the trend Nothing much Just cafes and shops and expensive clothes from china
2897,4.0,"If you are into Korean cosmetics, this is the place to shop. They have great deals for all your cosmetic needs. But if you're not into cosmetics, this is still a great place to visit especially at night because there are a lot of restaurants from korean bbq to street foods and ice cream."
2898,5.0,"Well very busy shopping high street . Lovely to see vital and a lot of street food you must see , I rated only in resturant called pane pizza great Italian food while shopping"
2899,4.0,"There are many tasty things to eat here, but I think the shopping is getting overpriced. You can find better deals inside of subway stations."
2900,3.0,"Same food, gadgets and accessories, even shops are the same nearly every block. The food on the street aren't that cheap for what they are."
2901,3.0,"Good shopping area with lots for everyone. Just beware of false advertisement. The saem shop tried selling my fiancée ""buy one get one free"" on an item at 100k won saying they were 100k each - but when it came up on the till it was just 50k won each. We walked out after them trying to back out of the story. Beware of anything in shops without price tags."
2902,5.0,"Plenty to eat and shop. Loaded of Korean cosmetic brand, shoes and cloth. Pricewise is very attractive but, if you have time I would recommend try and look around several shops before you buy as prices may vary even for the same products."
2903,4.0,"This place is busy even late at night. Plenty of food carts, skin care products, clothes, shoes. You can even watch some shows here like Nanta."
2904,4.0,I enjoyed the cultural experience and work of talented artesian. Stocked up on beautiful paper and calligraphy supplies.
2905,4.0,Pretty crowded and full of Korean cosmetics shops and restaurants. I think some of the restaurants are overpriced since it's a tourist spot?
2906,3.0,"It is the most famous shopping street in Korea. It is also the best place to meet young people. Since it is pushed by Japanese Chinese tourists, it is no longer a korea street. 한국에 가장 유명한 쇼핑거리이다 젊은이들에 만남에 최고에장소이기도하다 언제부터인가 일본 중국관광객들에 밀려서 이제는 중국인거리라고해도 손색이없다"
2907,5.0,all famous brands of cosmetics are all around. also street food at night. I bought like a luggage of cosmetics. Too cheap to be real but it's real. ^^!
2908,5.0,"This place just has a great atmosphere. There are so many restaurants, local stores, clothing stores, etc. This place is just great for shopping and have a good vibe. You would feel like walking in times square without the tall buildings though. You want to make sure you have gelato ice cream."
2909,5.0,Lots of shopping and lively action going on all day into the evening. We had fun trying different foods at the street vendors. We will definitely come back.
2910,5.0,Great shopping center with some entertaining street snack... Many skin care product with low price and good quality..

2914,4.0,"It's very crowded with tourists everyday. There are alot of make up shops everywhere. Walk a few lanes and you will see alot of repeated shops selling masks, make up etc. The line shop is pretty packed too. The food stalls are pretty expensive. I rather go in a restaurant instead. But Myeongdong is great as you can find everything there."
2915,4.0,"The shopping is really great, but since it's a tourist area it tends to be very crowded. Try to avoid going there on the weekends, also note that the restaurants are usually a bit more expensive there, but nothing major."
2916,5.0,"This is the place where you want to shop for cosmetics or even clothes. Once you are here to have to hold yourself, or you are going to buy everything. They even have a street food stall from the corner until the other side of myeongdong. There are cheap sweater or coat between them. Try the famous Kyoja noodle while you are there. You would need your passport if you buy cosmetic more than 30000 won to get tax refund."

2919,2.0,"Lots and lots of stores. Lots and lots of the same stores. How many Innisfree shops can there be? People flock here for the average purchase.  When I was there, food carts were set up down the main street. It was busy with all sorts of activity. I tried several of the foods, but they were all ""fast food"" and not good food.  Interesting to see."
2920,3.0,"We visited the area during our walkabout of the Myeong-dong area. Lots of department stores and shops that sell brand name clothes, cosmetics and accessories. If you like branded products, you will probably like this area. However, I prefer local markets like Namdaemun where prices are cheaper and I don't have a preference for brand names."
2921,5.0,Stayed in a hotel in the area. Well worth it. So many things to see and buy. Sellers are friendly. A good place for shoe lovers.
2922,5.0,"We stayed here in myeongdong because I've read reviews about this place and we did'nt regret it. 5mins walking distance from our hostel to the shopping district. The price of their shoes is much lower and you can take the tax refund also at the airport. Every corner has lots of beauty products to choose from.I enjoyed buying lots of face mask and make up from etude,skinfood,missha. The street foods was really tempting so you don't need to eat sometimes in the restaurant. We really enjoyed our shopping here.I just wish we had a chance to shop at the lotte mart."
2923,4.0,"Myeongdong is one of the most important shopping area in Seoul and it famous for plastic surgery and women care products. Myeongdong Shopping Street is close to my Hotel and it Always busy.There are many shops, restaurants ,cafe in the street.On the other hand the smell not good.The product not cheap,you should bargain.I enjoyed buy frech fruit in this market/"

Buy 30 masks for 60,000 won and you get another 30 masks for FREE at Tony Moly. They give you tons of free stuff too.  I was able to buy some colored lenses for 45,000 won (buy 1 get 1 Free).  Don’t forget to bring your passport to avail of the tax free on purchases 30,000 won and above.  I heard the night market is pretty awesome too. But we left around 3pm.  Totally a fun place to shop!"
2925,5.0,"This area is filled with stores. There are other things going on like a Nanta theater. The main focus is all the shopping so if Korean products (makeup, clothing, jewelry, or hats with Korean words) is what you're looking for then this is the place to go. It is very crowded, but not impossible. The largest UNIQLO in Korea is also located here. If it's not shopping then go for the all the different street foods (salty type and dessert types plus fruits. yes you can just get a cup of fresh blended fruit juice). Otherwise, there are also cafes to take a break if needed from the shopping."
2926,5.0,"Cosmetics cosmetics cosmetics! Very lively with a lot of street food vendors as well. Area is safe, easy to navigate. A lot of clothes store as well."
2927,4.0,"Went there in the evening in search of a seafood restaurant. This market is full of lanes loaded with stalls of variety of food and shops. Walked and shopped here for two to three hours. There are many local shops as well as malls in this area. All shopping stores start closing at 9:30 pm and after that only restaurants are open. If u r a fan of bao bao bags and can't afford it , here you can buy the cheap imitations at a very reasonable price. A good place to bargain. Loved shopping here. A must visit ."
2928,5.0,"Lots of stores to choose from. Better if you focus on what to buy. Great steals are of course buying in bulk. Buuuut, might end up buying more than what you need :p Street food - expensive compared with other locations such as those near universities. Shopping - found myself buying in duty free malls for instant tax refund."
2929,5.0,"Big area full of girls paradise, skin care, makeup, dress, all you can find, plussss food was great here, u will get confuse what do u want too eat, coz everything was tempting!"
2930,4.0,"Very crowded; a lot of foodstalls, a lot of souvenir-stalls, and cosmetic shops! You can also find many restaurants. In my opinion, this place the right place to shop cosmetics, they offer many discounts, and also the price is cheaper than in my country (indonesia). I don't recommend you to shop souvenir in this place, because you can find cheaper souvenir in other place. Happy shopping!! :)  Note: there's also a beautiful cathedral (chatollic church)."
2931,5.0,"A lot of street food, wide variety. Some can be pricey. But there's also Macdonalds. Many shops, mostly beauty products."

At night the street in front of the shop turns into hawkers stall selling food item. You can get to taste all sorts of korean street food there. They have grill lobster, fried baby crab, rice cake, egg bun, ice cream and even halal kebab. If you are lucky you can also get good bargain for shoe at some of the shop. For tourist you can get the immediate tax refund from the shop with certain amount of purchase made but remember to bring along your passport."
2934,5.0,"I love myeongdong. It likes a cosmetic street. Halal food also available near apple shop. Face shop, nature republic every day sales. Awesome"
2935,4.0,Shopping all around is how I'll sum up this place. From the many stores selling anything from shoes to clothes to facial products it's a place that one must visit when in Seoul. There's also lots of food to choose from either from the restaurants or the food cart stores.
2936,5.0,"You will be surrounded by cosmetics shops..esp face mask. its heaven for women...a few good store like nature republic, innisfree, laneige, olive & young etc..look out for their promotion for best price. They try to lure you with free mask to go inside the shop. In the night, there will be alot people selling food and taste nice as well."
2937,4.0,"I'm not really a shopping person but I thoroughly enjoyed the wide variety of street food here. Sometimes it's a bit of a puzzle to find out what is being prepared/sold, but that's part of the fun I guess."
2938,5.0,"you can get cheaper price if you bargain with the seller if you talk nicely and not complaining to them. for real. and the cosmetic is everywhere. most of the shop is selling the cosmetic from hair to your toes, i suggest you to go to nature republic. you got to spend a lot of time and money there."
2939,4.0,"Face mask, trendy clothes and food stalls. Cheap cosmetic and face care. Stating in philstay myeongdong metro is a good recommendation as the owner gives personalized service."
2940,3.0,A lot of stores and yes street food. Many people and tourists of course on a Friday . We arrived at 9 pm and we noticed before 11 pm stores are starting to close even the street vendor. I'm not amazed food are expensive and I didn't find it quite good sorry. You could really compare it to Taipei night market. But my opinion is just for me you might enjoy here because of a lot of shops and duty free.
2941,3.0,Good younger people hanging out area to find good and cheap fashion and beauty products. Also have easy and well-priced eats.
2942,5.0,"We visited Seoul during the Holy Week and stayed at T Mark Hotel Myeongdong, just a few minutes leisurely walk or one subway stop away from the busier part of Myeongdong, its shopping street. We LOVE Myeongdong shopping street! We must have gone there almost every single night for shopping, Dinner, or simply strolling the busy lanes. We Love the place particularly at night when everything is lighted up. You won't run out of options for shopping and food, and the choices all fit anyone's budget. The atmosphere is lively, and just when you feel Myeongdong can't get any livelier and busier, the weekend comes and the already busy lanes are suddenly filled with more stalls carrying food, clothes, bags, etc. This place is a must visit to any tourist in Seoul. Don't forget to get your supply of Korean skin products! 😍😍😍"
2943,3.0,"Myeongdong is a must-visit of korea because of its popularity but it's only worth it to pop by for just one evening. It mainly consists of korean cosmetic shops and the same shop appears every 50m or so. Great if you need some makeup and skin care or if you want to visit flagship stores like style nanda pink hotel and Aland. Otherwise, if you are looking to just busk in a chill atnosphere, Hongdae more diverse and more happening."
2944,3.0,In Seoul I didn't go to the electronic market. All the other markets and shopping areas I visited did not have any thing that's worth while carrying back as everything except for the facemasks and other beauty products can be bought in most other countries I have visited at a cheaper price. Seoul is definitely not a shopping destination.
2945,4.0,"Here at Myeongdong you will also find big-name stores like Spanish fashion chain, ZARA and Forever 21. Migliore, easily accessible via Exit 4, Myeong-dong Subway Station, is a starting point to shop for many tourists coming out of the subway station.  There are also many street food stalls serving traditional Korea delicacies such as fish cakes, tteokbokki (a stir-fried dish made of rice cakes with vegetables in hot sauce) as well as new food inventions like the potato tornado! So if you don’t have time for a proper sit-down dinner/lunch, just grab some food on the go, shop through a few shops/street stalls and then grab something else from the next food stall and continue on!"
2946,4.0,it took us 1 hour to wander thru this street as there are many nice shops. great place for tourists to buy souvenirs and to taste local food.
2947,5.0,Loved walking around here and buying awesome cosmetics! So much to see and alleys to walk through! You can get lost b cause you have so much fun walking around!
2948,4.0,This is heaven of comestic. A lot of brand: Innisfree (wifi-free); Natural Repubpic; Style Nanda (only one store) Street food is expensive and It does not match my taste
2949,5.0,"most of the shops are for skincare and cosmetic product like Sulwhasoo, Innisfree, Laneige, Faceshop, TonyMoly , etc. Hungry..? The street is fully of food carts in the evening. also have few halal food carts."
2950,4.0,"Myungdong is one of the best places for shopping, food with short distance benefit to connect to sightseeing places. It is in the middle of the Seoul (Northern part of river) which can be easily connected to Namsan (top hill), Gyeongbok palace and other palaces, Cheongye streams and many museums. I recommend to stay near Myundgong and visit these fantastic sightseeing places and enjou night at Myundong. You will enjoy a lot of fasion products and a full bunch of street food and restaurants~~"
2951,3.0,"Must visit for sure, but I did not think it was great snd the shopping os only average. Lots of beauty shops which is the norm everywhere in Korea."
2952,5.0,Cosmetics stores abound in this area where cheap but quality products are on sale.... a million won is just about 5thousand pesos so dont be discourage when buying..
2953,3.0,Myeongdong is a famous shopping street.. I think it's good.. But its expensive..  Sorry but the Korean people dose not respect me and dose not respect the Korean law about smoking..
2954,4.0,"We stayed at the Myeongdong area so we came everyday to enjoy the street food and shopping. Love their food specially tteokbokki, geranpang, and scallop cheese. So many things to see and to buy. And they can keep the area clean."
2955,4.0,"Visiting Korea will not be complete without passing Myeongdong! Cosmetic and food lovers, young and young once, ladies and gents will find this part of Seoul quite dazzling! The fusion of Myeongdong Cathedral, hotels, shops, theater, foods makes this place a must stop in visiting Korea. The lady attendants are speaking good english already so foreigners can easily communicate. Enjoy your shopping!!"
2956,5.0,Good shopping. Thank goodness I was here with my teenage daughter and not my husband! Loads of different types of shops. Store staff friendly and not pushy. Felt very safe working around. Loads of coffee shops that you can hop into when your arms get too tired!
2957,5.0,"This has absolutely everything you could imagine for shopping, and incredible food stalls all along the way. Why had I never had a cheese scallop before?Incredible."
2958,4.0,"Great place to find all the Korean beauty products, shop! Don't miss Lotte department store food court and market. Just the best."
2959,5.0,"When speaks about Myeongdong most people think about shopping for clothes, accessories, cosmetics, etc. But for me Myeongdong is a good place to eat, especially on the street. There are lots of delicious street foods you can choose and enjoy."
2960,4.0,"Basically camped out at Missha, Laneige and Innisfree. The place is full, literally full, of shops selling cosmetics. Every street has the same few names repeated. Also lots of shops selling trendy clothes. Then walked under ground to Lotte mart and got Lotte biscuits. And there is live abalone 6 for 30000 won."
2961,5.0,Korean makeup stores everywhere I truly enjoyed shopping for my favorite makeup brands especially its much cheaper than in my home country. What makes it even more enjoyable I got to take a lot of freebies thou sometimes you have to ask from the sales lady. Some are not friendly and not accomodating not all can speak in English. There are Taiwanese and Chinese sales lady who can speak in Mandarin. Night market and street food vendors starts at 4pm onwards which I truly indulge in them. ALWAYS BRING YOUR PASSPORT if you spent Krw30000 to get tax refund and ask the store first if they would refund it outright otherwise you will need to get the tax refund at the airport
2962,5.0,We stayed for 5 nights in the heart of Myeongdong. It was a great choice. We are not really shoppers but there are shops everywhere including some very large department stores. Prices are comparable to those in Australia if not higher however I am sure the dedicated shopper would find better prices in some of the smaller outlets The great attraction of this place is the market food stalls which set up everywhere after around 2pm offering all kinds of Korean delicacies freshly prepared in front of you and costing very little There are some good restaurants in the area as well which we managed to visit however we couldn't resist the food stalls each day even for just a quick snack Glad we stayed here and would do so again next time we visit Seoul
2963,5.0,"Myeong-dong shopping area is very conveninance near subway line 2 and line 4. Each shopping ticket amounted over 30,000 won can get tax free directly or tax refund at designated counters or kiosks at Myeong-dong Shopping Area. Get the tickets and ask the shop staff you can have clear and comprehensive information. Enjoy 10% tax refund."
2964,3.0,Must visit when in Korea. So many stores and restaurants in the vicinity. If you have lots of budget i would suggest to stay in hotels in this area.
2965,4.0,"My wife spent one whole day to purchase cosmetics, and many store clerks are very generous to offer u a lot lot of samples!"
2966,5.0,"A huge number of shops and modern styles. You can find all you are looking for, even on the side streets."
2967,5.0,Bustling shopping neighborhood. Dozens of cosmetics shops - you can walk 5 minutes and find 4 different Nature Republic shops. At night they have food carts with lots of delectable eats. Great for daytime or evening exploring!
2968,4.0,"Myeongdong street is huge and mainly dominated by cosmetics shops so if you have that shopping list from friends & family to fill, this would be the perfect place.You will find cosmetics shops every step of the way and the face masks are at ridiculously cheap prices in packs. You can find Zara, Adidas, Nike and a few other famous shops too. There's also street stalls selling Supreme goods (fufu or fake, obviously) and food which can be quite expensive, in my opinion. If you are looking for endless options of clothes, head over to Dongdaemun instead."
2969,3.0,A great place to get your cosmetic but the street were too hectic and confusing. Most of the sale speaks Chinese so it was ok if you try to specific product. Most Korean can speak English and understandable but not great.
2970,4.0,"It's a lovely place to wander around at night, hustle and bustle of the locals and tourists makes it a lively place - full of local eats, street food and deserts! Not really a place to go and drink - but there are one or two bars in the area (unless I just completely missed them!)"
2971,5.0,"Mostly malls close around 8pm in Seoul which is early for me as In singapore they close around 9:30pm - 10pm. This market was only place which be busting with people after 8pm also. So many shoe shops and lot of korean cosmetic shops, you could buy everything from there. great street food."
2972,4.0,"It is very busy I thing 24 hours, if you like shopping and eating you are in the right place, try street food!"
2973,5.0,"It is everything you read, it's probably more than that. For westerners that come for makeup, I'm not sure you'll like it. It's brands you don't really get (at least in Australia) on top of the possible language barrier in either shop assistant or product text. It starts waking up around 10am, it's a big area, but some brands have 2-3 shops of varying sizes in the area.  At night there are night food stalls which are delicious. Or many a Korean bbq meals."
2974,5.0,"Went on a Sunday afternoon and the streets were packed. Just about every beauty product you can think of is available. Reasonable prices. Sunday also features a great assortment of street food including lots of fish and lobster. Price per serving is around 5,000 to 10,000 KRW. Definitely worth a visit for the experience."
2975,5.0,"Sundays after 1:00 P.M. are a great time to come here to shop and try famous Korean street food. From lobster tail to chicken skewers to waffles, everyone is sure to find something to satisfy. Also, the shops range from H&M to Zara to Nike you will find something that you are looking for. Also find, a large Methodist and Catholic Church. Plan to spend a few hours there."
2976,5.0,"We are here for three days already. We hang around the area & kind of too spoiled by this area because it is full of varieties - street vendors and all kinds of shops, famous popular shops and too many little shops await you to find out, & restaurants that you should try one by one. We buy too many things and can not stop buying. You will know the place only when you are here. 我們待在這裡已經三天了，一直待在這個讓我們寵壞的區域因為這裡什麼都有～太多路邊攤和各式各樣的店、網路名店和自己找出來的一大堆個性店、還有應該一間一間吃的各種餐廳，我們買了好多東西，很可怕的是停不下來。。。請來親自體驗！"
2977,5.0,Reasonable price and fair quality. Food also nice and cheap. Can have half day exploring and enjoying here. 10k won for each nice hat! Good deal I think!
2978,5.0,"A famous shopping paradise in Seoul, you cannot miss it, otherwise you may regret. Apart from shopping, there were many street snacks like traditional Korean snacks, grilled abalone, cut fresh fruit and many more... You can't stop eating during the street exploring."
2979,4.0,"exit via Myeong-dong Subway Station, it is really aceessible. street local delicacies. so many starbucks around. heaven for the ladies! must visit when you are in seoul!"
2980,2.0,"People go there for shopping but I prefer a big mall. This street is too busy all the time. Full of tourists. If you are curious, visit just once."
2981,5.0,"I absolutely loved Myeongdong! It offers my two favorite things: cheap eats and shopping. There is no shortage of places to purchase clothing or beauty products! All of the beauty supply stores offer amazing discounts and BOGO deals on sheet masks and other beauty products. In between shops we tried all types of delicious street food. Definitely try the fried spiral potatoes, the spicy rice cakes and the lobster tails with mozzarella."
2982,5.0,"There is halal snacks available, one near the zara and forever21. And another along the street. We prayed at the cultural centre which is located at the upper floor,.it's either 3rd or 5th floor at the entrance between Zara.And.forevrr21.  Halal food at busanjip which is at one of the alleys. Ask the people in red and a red hat, information people for directions.  Myeongdong street is facial products heaven. Not for clothes, clothes at dongdaemum or ehwa uni. Please compare the price against the shops down the road, there are always discounts and offers available.  You should watch Nanta if you're there. Funniest live show ever. Really made me LOL"
2983,5.0,"it slocated where you can buy thier beauty products a lots a place to chooice with,the street is amazing food try to go with empty stomach so can try all the food on the street."
2984,5.0,"Great place to go shopping for cosmetics, clothes, trinkets, food. Easy to get to by subway. Stores don't open til 10am and there is street food at night."
2985,5.0,"Just be aware that there are a lot of people always on this street. The number of good restaurants is around. Samgyetang, Gomtang and Jeonju bibimbap etc... It could be a bit annoying to see people calling you for massages and some other stuff. Also have a lot of shops for cosmetics... It is really shopping heaven."
2986,5.0,"you can never get sick shopping here, especially knowing that your own country charges you double or more for the same products"
2987,4.0,"This street is always overcrowded, but particularly at night, when the street food stalls appear. It is quite atmospheric, but it gets annoying if you don't like crowded places. There's a huge Uniqlo store if you need to do some clothes shopping. If you're looking for cosmetics, there are soooo many shops you can choose from."
2988,5.0,"We went twice there, A lot of shopping in this place, there is Daiso there, we didn't see it at first ;so cheap with great stuff don't miss it"
2989,4.0,Its mental here. So many people and so much to see.  Great shopping for girls especially for skin care products but I just liked the food great street food and plenty of options.  If you are in the area or headed to the seoul tower its worth checking out even if just for a feed
2990,5.0,I love the beauty products and kpop stuff. You can also enjoy yummy food here. Enjoy nanta show if you have time.
2991,4.0,"Just off the street there are a few nice outdoor mall areas that boast an array of souvenir shops, chemists and restaurants. We could only find one bar and it was not open until late."
2992,5.0,"Street food, restaurants, skincare shops, clothing shops are abundance. You can literally everything and anything (stuffs that you need and even stuffs that you didn't know you need). It can get really crowded especially on the main alley that some people might find it overwhelming. Use the smaller alleys to avoid the crowding.  Make sure to visit on an empty stomach. Bear in mind, depending on the number of food items you bought from the street food (not cheap), altogether the cost would probably be enough for you to get a meal for 2 at a sitting down restaurant.  Example: Meal for 2 at a jjimdak restaurant 29,000won (with refillable side dishes and you get cold water)  Street Food (below are just some of the street foods but there are a ton more varieties) fresh fruit drink 5,000won chicken skewer 3,000won fish cake skewer 2,000won grilled small-med lobster tail 7,000won grilled pen shell 7,000won"
2993,4.0,"Everyone comes for the skincare deals and street food stalls - and there's an abundance of it.  All the big korean brands have several branches every few blocks, so if one particular shop is full of people, you can walk several meters to the next corner and you'll probably see another store of the same brand. There are also loads of deals at each store. Special freebie packs that change monthly, free face masks upon entry, tons of samples at the counter, and more.  For food, you'll never go hungry. For 1000-6000 won per stall, you can try everything from grilled meats to seafood to footlong ice cream to freshly squeezed juices. There are also plenty of sit down restaurants around.  It's a busy area that never seems to run out of tourists and locals."
2994,4.0,"There's not much to say about this place because it is already famous and well-documented as one of the must-visit place in South Korea. There's a lot of thing to buy here especially cosmetics and beauty products. There also a lot of fashion store, electronics, restaurants and local food stall which is very intriguing to try. Overall, it is very enjoyable place to visit."
2995,5.0,"This is a great place during the day, but really picks up after dark. The streets are lined with shops and street food vendors. We enjoyed all the cosmetics shops and dessert options."
2996,4.0,"Visited this area, much more than one street, several city blocks with many streets and side streets. The area contains make up, clothes, food, drink. At night there are food vendors and night market type vendors. This is a very busy area at night. Good place to catch dinner and pick up some items you might need ."
2997,5.0,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is a place you MUST go to when visiting Seoul. First of all, there is an extensive range of shopping there, both cheap and high end. There are so many different stores in Myeongdong that there will definitely be a place for everyone. Shops are open until late at night, and you can shop til you drop! Literally! As a foreigner, I was worried as I have very limited korean language skills, however all shop assistance and street stall owners were very kind and helped me in finding directions. The food there is amazing, and the food stalls sell korean snacks and foods that are absolutely delicious and you must try it. There are also many restaurants there to choose from, mainly serving Korean food, and at a reasonable price. Since I lived in a hotel in the shopping street, everything was very convenient. The hotels in the area are not very expensive and I would recommend staying near or in the shopping street as it is very convenient and there is also a subway station very near, and there are many taxis too. In regards to shopping, there are Korean boutiques selling cheap but good quality and stylish clothing, as well as bigger brands. There are also many Korean cosmetic stores and MANY FREE SAMPLES ARE GIVEN. There are also more high end brands located there. Basically, everything you could possibly want is in Myeondong! It is a food and shopping paradise and not very expensive at all. It is a MUST visit destination for tourists!"
2998,5.0,"Since I lived in a hotel in the heart of Myeongdong, I was exposed to the shopping street day and night which was fantastic, it was both busy in the morning and at night and gave off a pleasant atmosphere. Here, there were a wide variety of stores and it really is quite exciting. Here, there are mainly cosmetic stores, clothing stores and such which is perfect for the shoppers: I bought so much there. Not to mention, at 5pm the street food stalls open and let me tell you they are delicious. Normally, when I travel i feel foreign or not so welcomed but when I went here it was so warm (even though it was winter and I WAS FREEZING) and welcoming. I can't emphasise enough but this is a must go destination for those wanting good shopping and excitement. Coming at day gives one feeling but coming at night provides you with the food stalls and exciting lights and such so choose wisely! It is definitely worth it!"
2999,5.0,"If you're really into Korean skincare, cute accessories or trendy clothes this is definitely a place for you to visit! The only thing is it can get quite crowded here especially towards the evening, but visiting a bit earlier before sunset around 6pm ish is still ok. There are also loads of street foods to try out and restaurants ticked away to help re-energise you for more shopping! The sales assistants are all lovely and helpful and not too pushy."
3000,4.0,"Always very crowded but you can find loads of Korean cosmetics shops around. Off course there are also clothes,shoes shops and restaurants. There is also a Nanta theater. The money exchange places are open daily and the rates in my case were quite good."
3001,5.0,"If you are in the mood for voyeurism and shopping, than this is the place to be. Masses of people from all over, navigating the beauty/fashion world in a pleasant environment. You can find everything from fresh seafood meals to kpop to bubblebath....."
3002,5.0,Nice place to grab some bargains. Lots of choice for souvenirs and food options good. Surrounded by larger mall type shops
3003,4.0,"Don't do like I did and go there before 5PM. Although all shops will be open, you won't find the most important: the food stalls, which arrive at 5PM. Most of the stores are for women. A lot of cosmetics, accessories and clothing. It's a nice place to go at night."
3004,5.0,"A great place to shop for: -Beauty products (skincare and makeup) -Has many chain brands: Apieu, Aritaum, The Face Shop, Skinfood etc. - Behind all the beauty brands, there are great places to eat! - Beware of sales people outside of the shops, they will approach you. -Free samples upon entering all beauty shops. -Many cheap clothing stores (8000 won and up). -Stationary stores.  Stroll along the various streets at night if you want to see the food stalls selling street food! They start selling at around 6pm."
3005,5.0,Great place to do shopping be careful like everything is so cute and you can find all kind of stuffs so it's better to leave this place for the last day in Seoul so you will not worry about your budget and buy whatever you want.
3006,4.0,"This is a great street to get anything Korean and shop till you drop. You can bargain if you want, but they will mainly give you a discount only if you buy a bit more than one or two items. Lots of nice street food available, so basically you can shop and eat your way the whole day here."
3007,5.0,"Always like to buy things here. With all the cosmetics brands here. You sure can find what you need and want. If you come at night, along the street there is different stalls selling food and drinks."
3008,5.0,I love shopping here but (bit expensive) whenever we in Seoul and our daughter love the cat mascot too. There also halal restaurants to choose but we love trying Korean food (seafood)
3009,5.0,"Myengdong Shopping is a vibrant shopping and eating extravaganza. The place to go for cosmetics, lots of cosmetics. Crowd watching is also fun. Street food vendors offer an array of local food selection but in my opinion, they are overpriced."
3010,5.0,"Great for shopping, especially cosmetics! If you are not satisfied with the discounts from a particular shop, just walk on and you will find another similar store with even better discounts.  Street food carts set up around 3 plus in the afternoon and the view of the carts coming down the streets is a sight to behold. Delicious street food like baked squid and strawberry mochi are must-trys!  Best place to rest your feet after shopping is at Sulbing:) Their bingsus are amazing and worth every penny! Daebak! Tried the green tea, cheesecake and summer melon special. Green tea is the best! They also have free flow buckwheat tea to quench your thirst.  You'll never get tired of Myeongdong!"
3011,4.0,"A lot of Malls, Shops and Street Food in this street. I don't mind spending hours in this street because you can find in it all what you need in shopping."
3012,3.0,"Great area to explore and do some shopping and food sampling. Lots of cosmetics if you're into that. Slightly better at night as more food vendors are open for business. Great variety and inexpensive way to try authentic Korean street food. Not a lot of friendly faces, but easy to point at what you want to purchase. Recommended as 'one of the top 10 things to do in Seoul'."
3013,4.0,"Very touristy area with lots of shopping, street food, and of course tourists! You can find all the cosmetic stores here, athough the prices are a lot cheaper at the duty free stores inside Incheon airport. The street food are all delicious and cheap. There are some good buys from the carts selling stuff in the middle of the street (like women's clothes and sunglasses), but I would stay away from the actual stores unless they have really good deals because they're just more expensive. The place is very crowded, but it's a good place to visit in Seoul!"
3014,4.0,"Anything except Myeongdong smell of Korean life! I mean, if you live out the high skyscraper and the business company, here you can find the real life of Koran. Cool also for going out for dinner with friends"
3015,4.0,"We visited Myeongdong Street early afternoon and walked around and looked at the many shops. About 4.30 in the afternoon, all the street vendors started appearing and the smell and sights were just amazing! Lots of different foods were sampled ranging from baked potatoes to luscious seafoods curries stirfries fruit and deep fried ice cream! Many people to see as well! Highly recommend a visit and go hungry as there's lots to choose from!"
3016,5.0,We visited Myeongdong shopping streets few times. So many shops and restaurants. Thoroughly Enjoyed shopping these streets. There are also many street stalls. Very vibrant and busy.
3017,1.0,Less than expected!  I'm that type of people who cannot survive with the smell of fried food!  The stuff there are mostly can be found anywhere and the prices are quite high
3018,5.0,It's full of things to buy and eat! Especially during the night time! I bought some cosmetics as it were very cheap.
3019,4.0,"Myeongdong is one of the busiest places in Seoul and it is considered Korea's premier shopping destination. It is a stunning shopping district with countless shops and restaurants. With Lotte and Shinsegae anchoring the area and a number of large shopping malls lie along the streets. Clothing shops or cosmetics can be seen at a very corners and streets stall for the spaces in between offering tasty street food snacks and inexpensive clothes and accessories. Can be easily reach by taking the Subway: Subway Line 2 Euljiro 1-ga Station Exit 6 and Subway Line 2 Myeongdong Station Exit 6. Myeong-dong combination of historical significance, nearby tourist attractions, and prime shopping has established it as the ultimate tourist destination in Seoul."
3020,4.0,"My teenage kids loved the excitement and vibe of the area. Alot of neat little places to eat and when the street food comes out it gets interesting. As far as shopping, it's mostly beauty and skin care. A lot of western clothing stores but we really enjoyed the excitement and vibe of the area."
3021,3.0,"Absolutely loved the food here at 4 places here: 1. Andong Jimdak (braised chicken) 2. Myeongdong Dumplings 3. O Sulloc cafe 4. Gogung restaurant  The shopping here is catered mainly for skin care , Line teddy bear and young adult/ teen fashion."
3022,5.0,"Ladies, this place is heaven 😉 Seven shops out of ten is a cosmetic or skin care shop. The choice is enormous. There are lots of places to eat around, some stalls with street food and just fun place to be😁"
3023,5.0,"Good for an afternoon time. All shops are there, sellers are quite familiar with English and the range of products covers any need. Plenty of choices to eat or have a coffee break. Prepare your credit card and go! 😉 Enjoy"
3024,4.0,"this is a busy shopping area heaps of diversity throngs of people,definetly not boring,especially later in the day"
3025,4.0,"While I was living 2 hours south of Seoul in the middle of nowhere, this became my go to shopping district. It has every store imaginable. Great street food while also a great variety of restaurants. We were also able to find decent accommodation in the area."
3026,5.0,Busses drop PJ hotels gestures you never get bored From Myeondong Market Korean peoples too kind and Helpful
3027,4.0,"Very busy neighborhood, but great for shopping. Cosmetic stores are all over the place, you can shop and then relax with a great Korean massage!"
3028,5.0,Very crowded but so worth to visit for cosmetic shopping as the shops in Myeongdong provides the most sample products and gift! Street food also very tasty!
3029,3.0,Nothing very exciting but it s convenient place for shopping. On evening there is lot of small shops to eat on the street and there is lot of souvenirs shops. This place is great to find restaurant on evening or to change money.
3030,5.0,"Great place to do some shopping in Seoul. Tons of cosmetic shops, clothing stores, department stores, street vendors, you name it. Almost forgot, this place is packed with hotels and restaurants. Got take a look."
3031,5.0,"Good shopping and yummy food, bring cash and an empty stomach! The cheesy lobster is very good and the fresh fruit juices are a treat!"
3032,4.0,"You can get to Myeongdong shopping street taking the subway and alighting at Myeongdong station at the south or Euljiro 1-ga up north of the area. It is almost like a huge square and you walk from north to south and then east to west. There are many exits but EXITS 1,2,3 & 4 would lead to the opposite side of the street. So better to exit at EXITS 5,6,7,8 or 9. There's also a underground shopping mall at exit 7 and 8. Exit 8 would lead you to the iconic green leaf building of Nature Republic. It's better to come in the evening till late if you want to sample their street food. There's also NANTA theatre, (not to be confused wth Myeongdong Theatre). Of course you can find shops and shops of cosmetic and skin care products, restaurants, cafes, massage parlor, fashion outlets and hair salons. Look out for their CAT cafe and DOG cafes if you are a animal lover. There are guides in distinctive uniform walking around offering help to tourist. Most shop attendance and restaurant staff speak Mandarin, so language is not really a problem. It's a must visit if you are in Seoul."
3033,5.0,"Not as inexpensive as in Goto Mall, more classy stores are found here. Mnay local Korean brands (clothes and cosmetics) here, and the food stalls are very attractive too! Energetic place, love it!"
3034,5.0,A lot of street food that you should try and some of them should put up a 'halal' sign if it's halal so that we don't have to always ask the same questions.  The socks sold there are must buy too as I tried to buy bulk in dondaemun but don't find that kind of design.  Souvenir t shirt can buy at Namdaemun for lower price.
3035,4.0,Had a great time just window shopping at the retail stores and gazing at all the street food options along this famous shopping street. Something for everyone
3036,5.0,"This place has got everything you can ever imagine! starting from regular trade marks and luxurious brands shops to street market with fake bags and accessories to any taste. There is also sort of local pottery and souvenirs market where you can find amazing cutleries and porcelain plates, magnets, souvenirs and even fures. You should visit!"
3037,4.0,Lots of shopping if you're interested in it. However I wouldn't say this is the most impressive shopping area that I've been to.
3038,4.0,"A shopping heaven! Especially for face masks and make up and a bit of everything! It's quite easy to get lost as there are shops of the same name everywhere, it's like if u miss a shop, you will find it in the next corner! But be careful of the saleswomen, they are like bees and we are like flowers, scary sometimes! Of course one thing to be sure is that you need to find the will to resist your temptation! ( from buying goods, face masks etc) there are some snacks/ street food too in the evening.... smell wonderful! It's like causeway bay in hk, princess street in Edinburgh but crazier! There are some nice cafes too."
3039,4.0,This area is worth visiting fur the fun of it and to taste different food But not for the prices or shopping.
3040,3.0,"One of the busiest areas in Seoul and sometimes not the most pleasant one. Thank god we had a wonderful and tranquil hotel to ease our minds and regain our sanity, because this place will make you crazy. Loud music, the same shops over and over again, everything revolves around beauty and cosmetics...it is all a bit tiresome."
3041,3.0,"Honestly i went there just to try the street food. So many cosmetics shop. I love their LUSH store as the promoter are really nice, helpful & generous comparing to other LUSH store in Seoul. Come early as everything close down by 10pm :("
3042,5.0,"Myeongdong is known as the shopping mecca of Seoul, where you can find cosmetics, fashionable clothes, bags and shoes. There are also several authentic korean restaurants and delicious street foods in Myeongdong. A must visit for tourist visitng Seoul! I Love Myeongdong!"
3043,5.0,"Too many to shop,all the Korea famous makeup shop located in,and so many good restaurants,after 5:00 pm you could find a lot of local street foods on the road ,don't forget try the traditional eggs cakes it s so Yummy.Enjoy;)"
3044,4.0,"We went to Myeongdong to buy some cosmetics. We didn't have to search for the cosmetic stores, they where everywhere. Apart from that, they have alot of different food and snack stalls. Most of the stores closes at 23:00"
3045,5.0,Make a note to visit this place when you are in Seoul. It's a great market with excellent vibe. We went on a Saturday and it was buzzing with a lot of people. The choice of shops is brilliant especially for the ladies as they have hundreds of cosmetic shops.
3046,5.0,"Good restaurants including dessert cafe. Lots of shopping Uniqlo, Korean cosmetics etc street food. Lots of small streets, people, tourists, tax refund shop."
3047,5.0,"I love Myeondong shopping street. There are plenty of shops for beauty, restaurants, food stalls and all other vendors. Just go inside the shops i.e. facehops, etude etc and you will get free facial mask... It is exit 8 of Myeondong station. I just found out that Nature's Republic Building in the corner of the street is the most expensive building in Myeondong and the best noodles in SK is found in Myeondong too."
3048,4.0,"This place is teeming with shops, mostly beauty shops that have free giveaways at the entrance. Check them out! You can also get your streetfood fix here. But if you want some peace and quiet, I recommend NOT checking in here."
3049,3.0,"Went here on a Friday evening. For girls, this would be a one-day stop. So many shops, especially for cosmetics and skincare. Almost all the salespeople speak Chinese too. Not too much to see for guys, maybe some street food. But even then I think they may be overpriced. They do have more variety of street food than other shopping districts though.  I personally prefer Hongdae. More selection for guys, less crowded, younger vibe, slightly less touristy."
3050,4.0,"My family and I spend the late morning and early afternoon walking, shopping, eating, and simply enjoying the vibe. It's located near (walking distance - literally across the major roadway) Namdameum Market, so it's easy to do both if your up for it."
3051,5.0,"There are many shops everywhere, some have really good deals, others are chain stores where the price are pretty much the same. Expect most of the food are fried but you've got to try some of them. Great fun experience as I walk through the area with my family."
3052,5.0,"I bought some branded green tea cleansing foam at a duty free shop at US$6 each, yet to my surprise the same product at the branch shop of the brand at Myeongdong was only sold at W8,000 for buy one get one, i.e. W4,000 each, which is about US$3.5 only!!  So good!"
3053,4.0,Been to this market and all the market in the city.... Myeondong is only best for cosmetics and some street food... close to metro station.... not very big... many offers on cosmetics.... There are many market in the city... you should know what to buy and visit that market accordingly.
3054,5.0,"simply too many shops ...innisfree is my favourite ! no more free mask samples. they need you to enter the shop and listen to their sales talk before they give you the free sample masks. most of the time, the sales staff speak chinese. although i can speak chinese but i am not from china. i dont really feel good. wish they can just speak korean or english. besides this, the shops are simply too many to finish shopping in just one day !...the streetfood is tasty though bit expensive..."
3055,5.0,"as the description states... theres alot of junk to buy, but theres also some shops off the beaten path that provide extremely cheap custom work (as compared to american pricing); for instance i got 3 full tailored suits made in 2 days with a slew of options built in with awesome materials, shoes, custom hats to match, shirts, vests, the whole nine-for 200$USD! and there are electronics, and small batch manufacturing shops in there too!"
3056,5.0,Lot of little shops and many different street venders. Go hungry! The food was all good and the shops are reasonably priced. We went at 9 o'clock pm and left around 11 o'clock pm. A lot of the workers speak English too!!!
3057,4.0,"Theme: Shops, eateries, hotels/guest-houses, people. A dense shopping district with all kinds of branded and local goods. There are more shops in the Myeongdong MRT/underground/subway, too. Lookout for bargains in basement supermarkets - for souvenirs and local snacks (Lotte, etc).  Street food galore - must try - the variety of popular food culture/snacks from different parts of Korea will be here.  I stayed at a neighbourhood guest-house (Sunshine) - economical, friendly, cozy, clean and comfortable - conveniently located just 2 minutes walk from the hustle and bustle of the main shopping area but a stones throw from the MRT entrances and the airport bus shuttle stop.  p.s. drop in to the Cathedral right behind the shopping belt to get away from the excitement and din to rest your mind and tired feet. Also visit Namsan Park, Namsan Folk Village, Millennium Capsule and make your way to N Seoul Tower (try the funicular lift and ride the cable car) to catch a more scenic side of the city and breathtaking views from high above. Cannot miss the 'love-locks' decorations everywhere which adds such vibrant tones to the natural backdrop. I went right before dusk - gorgeous sunset scene from atop the mountain."
3058,5.0,"A place that you gotta visit carefully :)) Take your time, look around shops, decide what exactly you need to buy and which shop offers something that you need. Almost every shop offers tax refund when you purchase is 30.000 won or more. So to avoid unnecessary purchases take a thorough look through the offers first ;) And of course try local street food, it is absolutely safe to eat and delicious!!!"
3059,4.0,"The area is filled with beauty and cosmetic shops. I went in a few of them but did not buy anything. These beauty stores IMO are aimed for younger people. The prices are much cheaper in Korea if you used these brands e.g. Innisfree, Tonymoly, Etude House, Skinfood, Nature Republic, Face Shop, Banila, Missha, etc. Print coupons from the Korea Tourism website, you either get discount or bonus face masks. Bring your passport as many of these stores offer instant store discount if you spent over a certain amount. Usually as low as $50US.  There aren't a lot of clothing stores but I did find myself attracted to the supermarkets and accessories stores. Art Box has a lot of different things other than stationary like the stores in California, kinda like the Watson's in Taiwan and Hong Kong but cheaper. SPAO and Giordano were much more expensive in Korea fyi. Monologue was the only clothing store I managed to buy some decent tops without a hefty price tag or cheap materials. About $15-$20 US. The Line app store has a lot of fans taking photo with the gigantic brown bear. Lots of restaurants that I recommend trying rather than relying on street foods alone.  Food at the street vendors were much more expensive than any other Asian countries I have visited. e.g. a quail egg baked on a piece of bread no bigger than the size of an egg for $6US, or $5US for a cup of pomegranate juice. They were not yummy either. Too many selling the same items, and too many spicy rice cake - garaetteok. But I am still glad I got to try them. That's what vacations are for - to explore new things. :)  Money exchange is the best in Myeongdong area. We have exchanged money three times at three different stores, and the rate was always the same as or better than what we looked up on xe or oanda. And no fees! Bring your passport!!  Most stores are opened by 11am. Go after 6 pm for all the food vendors but not after 1030-ish. We went searching for food after arriving at our hotel at 1030pm, the vendors were sparse and we ended up grabbing some snacks from 7-11."
3060,4.0,"The place is so happening after sunset. Everybody is looking for something. The shops are looking for customers n the shoppers are looking for good bargains. Free masks if you enter their shops. The shops tend to repeat n reappear after a few steps. Don't worry if you miss one because the same one will show up again later unless it is a unique one. Bargain is the game. Once you hit rock bottom for the price, they will try to keep you happy by giving you additional free gifts. I leave when I have enough as the shopkeepers need to sustain too. Lots of drinks n food everywhere. Niche restaurants are tugged away but if you can find them, you will enjoy good old traditional Korean meals."
3061,5.0,"If you like to shop, this is where you want to be. This area has all the major shops and a lot of vendors on the street as well. You definitely will not find a shortage of face masks or Korean bbq. This area seems to be crowded no matter what time you go. A good place to go if you're looking for a shopping spree!"
3062,3.0,This place is no different from any shopping streets in other countries. You will see a lot of clothing and food stores along the street. If you come after 5pm you will find many food stalls on the street but it is not cheap.
3063,3.0,Every third store front sells a form of makeup and or skin care products. There is a lot of repetition in this area. There are also several tasty restaurants and food stalls that are out at night.
3064,4.0,Myeongdong has everything as shopping place and open till quite late compared to other place. Its good for first timer who would like to experience korea shopping alley and foods.
3065,5.0,"Probably my favourite place to shop after Myeongdong! Sadly most of the cosmetic shops here are repeats of one another, so there's no need to explore the entire area. But there's lots of food and shops here regardless, great to spend an afternoon here."
3066,4.0,"Typical shopping and food district in Seoul. Was there in the early evening, very crowded but with a good atmosphere- lots of locals and tourists. Shops galore - things are expensive compared to other Asian countries. Street food looks good and delicious but no where to sit and eat. Plenty of restaurants to choose from."
3067,4.0,It's really the best area to be especially at night. There is a festive atmosphere with all the bright lights and street food vendors . The stores close late at night which is great so you can do your sightseeing during the day and shop at night.
3068,4.0,"Lots of lights, shops and food stalls in the evening. Not a huge shopper, especially make up. Heaps of make up stores. Ignore that, go for vibe and food!"
3069,5.0,"If you are visiting Seoul, you must stay at Myeongdong - it's close to everything; shopping, eating..."
3070,4.0,"A must see. All smells of Korea. Street food, and plenty of people to mingle. Just walked around. Plenty of restraints and bars. I tried traditional only, they were great"
3071,3.0,We were told we should go to this area to shop and eat as it was popular. Too bad we had already eaten as there were a lot of food carts with great looking food. It is really long and you could shop for a long time. This area was much better than the Namdaemun Market area which was closer to our hotel but had more lower scale food and trinket carts. It also closed up much earlier. (To Travel Is To Live)
3072,3.0,"the Shopping street is very crowded, which is to be expected. the biggest issue is the abundance of stores selling facial products whose staff assualt you as you walk past and get annoyed if you don't buy anything."
3073,4.0,"Love stopping by here during my trip to Korea to visit relatives! A ton of great shopping both brand and little pop up style shops. This is a good spot for both luxury and on a budget type of shoppers. There's a range of things to shop for such as clothes, shoes, accessories, knick knacks, handbags, etc. And on top of that if you get hungry while walking around there are always cafes, street food, and restaurants in between shops on pretty much every block!"
3074,5.0,"Such a lively shopping area that becomes even livelier at night! I walked through this area during the day and loved it. Its full of great shops and food! Even better, as the sun sets, food vendors line the streets with so many amazing choices. Visit at night if possible. The stores stay open late and its just a fun atmosphere."
3075,5.0,A blend of international and local brands in glitzy shops. Clean and nice to wander through. If you like shopping you will love it here. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
3076,5.0,"This is a must-go-to place in Seoul if you like shopping! You take the (very easy) subway to Myeongdong station and (depending on which exit you use) head down to the right and you literally get thrown into the shopping-craze! There are small shops left and right, store attendants shouting (in a nice way) at you to walk into their store pushing free samples into your hands. In the middle of the streets there are food stalls where you buy goods like Ddeokbokki and fried shrimps to-go and then you sit down on steps to a store to eat it or if you're daring you eat it on the go."
3077,5.0,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is the place for cosmetic- and facial-crazy shoppers. One finds stores lined-up across and beside each other trying to entice you to enter their establishment with free give-aways- even f you don't purchase anything from them. On leaving the area, you'll probably be still loaded with facial creams and the like without actually buying anything. There are also shops with named brands such as Giordano, Uniqlo, Adidas and the sort. Interspersed among the shops are eateries, restos, cafes and of course Seoul's famous street food. Prepare to stay for 3-4 hrs (perhaps even more if you're really into make-up) . Myeongdong Station Line 4. Exit 6"
3078,5.0,This is a lively area with plenty of stores and street food. My kids loved trying all different types of food and ice cream. Definitely worth a visit.
3079,5.0,Myeong dong has various kind of food street in the evening.. We can enjoy shopping and delicious food street ..
3080,5.0,"For all those who want to buy cosmetics and facial care products, Myeondong is hard to beat. Prices are competitive too with offers which can rival the duty free shops. There are also one for one offers which can change by the day. Hence, going to the same shop can give you a better deal on a product on a different day. Only problem is that it's all by chance as we don't quite know when an offer appears until the day itself. Maybe if you can speak korean, the staff would be able to let you know although I haven't come across anyone who has had this privilege."
3081,5.0,"Vibrant place with narrow streets and full of light at night. Tons of shops for cosmetics and souvenirs, lots of nice food spots, subway nearby. Also advise to visit underground shopping mall with 'Made in Korea' clothes and jewelry."
3082,3.0,"Went here just for the novelty... Too busy & crowded. You have to push towards the people who for some reason chose to be at the middle of the street than eat beside street food stalls. Food stalls are good but pricey, tourist price. The only good point for me are the road shops, bought my fave skincare & got generous freebies! ;-)"
3083,5.0,"I visited Myeong Dong, in Seoul a few days ago. It's the best place for shopping. You can see a lot of restaurants, shopping malls, street food and any other dining options. One of the busiest areas in Seoul I believe. I love the vibes in Myeong-Dong and I'll definitely come back again when I was in Seoul."
3084,5.0,"Love the vibrancy there. All the popular brands of skincare congregate there. The jostling and pushing through the crowd while touters shoving free masks into our hands and coaxing us to enter their shops. Every 50 meters you will see a repeat of the same brand side by side each other. It's good to shop for better deal as each shop has different promotion and free gifts. By 4 pm the landscape change with the food carts and others setting up business there. Lots to see , eat ,shop or just people watch."
3085,1.0,totally commercial place..Visit here if you want to buy things with high price (only street things. except brand store).
3086,3.0,"Maybe it was original at one time, but now - not so much. I hear more Chinese or English from tourists than Korean."
3087,4.0,"Here you can find anything from hair salons to clothing stores and cosmetics stores galore. The Lotte department stores offer every brand from Prada, Gucci, Louis Vuitton and the like. Street shopping is so fun and safe."
3088,4.0,Nice and vibrant shopping area. Night market with food stalls selling at ridiculously expensive price for poor quality stoggy street food targetting tourists starts around 6pm.
3089,5.0,"Lots of choices, but can get a bit repetitive. Good to visit 2 or 3 times for one trip in order to get everything you want. Korean beauty products galore!"
3090,5.0,It's a heaven for people that love cosmetics. You can get a lot of cheap face mask and free sample cosmetics too. The place is also full of cafe and street food.
3091,5.0,"It's a great place to shop for skincare and make up. If I ever run low, I think I will make a trip to Korea to buy them. They give you one for one or free things or samples but only if you look hesitant. I was buying something for a friend and the assistant knew I was going to get it no matter what so I didn't get much.  Some assistants (Chinese) are very rude and will tell you to scram if you don't buy."
3092,5.0,The one stop location to try all Korean street food. This place comes alive only from late afternoon onwards till about 10pm. There are main shops along the streets that one can find all skincare brands you'll ever need.  Start walking from Myeongdong Station Exit 6 where the Uniqlo is and go along the street stalls.
3093,3.0,Myeongdong is crowded with tourists. Things much more expensive than other places in Seoul. A clear tourist trap. Only personal heath are products are priced fairly. Erwa woman University has better offers and prices half of that to Myeongdong.
3094,5.0,"We visited this area every day of our 6 day stay in Seoul… we liked it that much. It was fun to wander down the side streets also… lots of interesting places to eat. The shops all started to look the same after awhile… in fact there is a repeat of the same cosmetic shops throughout the area. The merchants that hustled us to go into their shops were sometimes persistent… and a bit annoying… but the excitement and ambiance of the entire area outweighed the pesky merchants. We especially loved all the yummy street food, and found it more exciting to walk around at night, with all the lights and action."
3095,4.0,"Many street foods with variable prices from 3,000 won,5k won to 10k won.Because it was raining, we enter small shop local cuisine which we just found out its very expensive price.We spent 54k just for 1 portion porridge,1 portion jjangmyeon(black bean noodle) and fried chicken.Just be aware when we enter shop.Better enter the shop which have a menu with price list.but myeongdong shopping street must visit place when in Korea.So many stalls like cloth stall and socks also."
3096,3.0,All the shops are that you can see in your country easily. What you can do is just watching shops and shopping.
3097,4.0,"This place caters not only to tourist like me but you meet the locals. There are plenty of korean street food and lots of clothes, cosmetic , and authentic korean food. Even at night lots of people are still crossing path."
3098,3.0,"Imagine a place with a labyrinth of streets lined with shops on both sides and stacked on top of each other. The outcome is an endless array of shops which an avid shopper would not be able to cover in one day. As amazing as this place is, the shops are fairly limited in its variety and mainly cater to the fashion and cosmetic shoppers. In addition, the restaurants are generally expensive, including even the street food vendors who came out in the evening."
3099,4.0,We enjoyed the time we spent in Myeongdong very much. It has a lot shops & restaurants arounded. Love it!
3100,5.0,"Pretty much heaven for those who like the korean skincare and makeup. Literally every single brand is here but there is also some branded clothing. If you want the cheap one, try the underground shopping. And starting 5.30 PM or so, there are lots of street foods, another must try. Recommended!"
3101,5.0,What are you doing in Myeondong? What else would you be doing? Shopping for fake designer underwear and socks for your friends back home! You're eating tasty Korean food at reasonable prices and buying all your girlfriends snail-extract face masks to keep their skin young! It's safe and you'll enjoy yourselves here.
3102,5.0,I love myeongdong because you can buy everything here but ofcourse since its one of the tourist spot the prices here are a bit higher compared to other same stores in other areas
3103,4.0,"Located on exit 6,7, and 8 Myeongdong station.many shops offer you t shirt,accessories,socks,restaurants,which the prize is acceptable.you can buy T Shirt in 3000₩,food street about 1000₩-5000₩,socks 1000₩,and tey offer you cosmetics from Etude,Leinage, Natur Republic etc. Myeongdong Shopping Street open from 10am till 10pm"
3104,5.0,"It's a very interesting place. I find that it's nicer than the Gangnam shopping streets because it's more geared towards tourists than locals. Mostly Chinese and Japanese tourists, but also Indian and European and North American. Many cheap hotels and motels to be found. Lots of great street food. Lots of really cheap massage places. Lots of currency exchange places. The other great thing about visiting Myeongdong, is that it's connected to Namdaemun Market, which is a gigantic indoor/outdoor market that sells food, clothes, household items, vitamins, imported goods, you name it they have it."
3105,5.0,"Meyongdong shopping street is very big and located in the almost city center place. They have many different shops especially my beloved line friends. From late afternoon, the night market begins with lots of different street food."
3106,3.0,Loads of street stalls for delicious snacks.. U can stroll along the area and eat til full. Many cosmetic shops but not the best deal in the city. Go to shopping mall duty free levels may have a better price for the same goods.
3107,5.0,"Lots of fashion outlets and beauty outlets.  The shopping belt is divided into different corners and alleys within the same vicinity. You might be spoilt for choices. Clothes, cosmetics, face masks, shoes, bags etc.  Also getting lots of attention is soft ice-cream at a height of 30cm."
3108,2.0,"I have been to many shopping streets such as in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore... Not cheap, nothing good, and nothing extraordinary. Even for cosmetics, you probably could buy the same thing elsewhere with the same price."
3109,5.0,There are many shops including brand name shops. Food were not very expensive and the taste were good.
3110,5.0,"The food vendors are safe. Probably safer than the US. It is fun and reasonable to walk down the streets in the area eating as you go. There are lots of restaurants. Soup restaurants, Andong chicken restaurants, dessert cafes. The desserts were expensive, but one was more than enough for 2 people to share. We stayed at the Ibis Ambassador Myeongdong which was right around the corner. Great location."
3111,5.0,"After reading other reviews on shopping in this district of Seoul, I have found them to be quite accurate! I am always searching for unique and cost effective items wherever in the world I travel. I make an effort to avoid tourist trap shops so, I dove into Myeondong in the evening picking up last minute buys before I headed back to the States. I was struck by the many street food vendors, which I could not resist. After fishcake snacks on a stick, vendors were literally tossing facial masks at you to entice you into their shops. The shops duplicate themselves, at least 3-4 of the same shop can exist on one block alone. Once you accept a facial mask, of course one feels obligated to go in, browse around and pick up something. For example In one shop, I purchased 20 facial masks for 5.90 WON. At the current exchange rate, approximately less than $5.00USD. The buys are there. From cosmetics and a few scattered clothing shops, and costume jewelry, I would recommend this area for landing great cosmetic deals and a festive yummy street food scene."
3112,4.0,"It is a great shopping place for skin care and costmetics. It has most of the korea brands there. In fact for some brands, there could be more than 1 shops.  Look out for sales as sale in 1 outlet might not be present in another outlet though they can just be a stone away."
3113,4.0,"I suppose I should be used to Asian shopping streets by now, but it seems I am not.  Myeongdong is bright, vibrant, full of locals and foreigners alike, shopping in a range of shops that start at small and rather mysterious and move on up to big, bright, fancy, loud. Interspersed are restaurants and some street food that is mystifying, scary, and - often - smelling really good. Not that I can identify much of what's on offer.  Korea has much the same attitude about shopping that Japan does (as much of the world seems to as well), treating it as an activity rather than a necessity, an event, a day or night out.  I can't quite get my head around that idea, but I must say that Myeongdong is an experience. Once, however, was enough for me."
3114,5.0,"It's one of my favorite places in Seoul. A lot of things to offer! Street food is everywhere, and mind you, it's clean! A lot of good deals from different shops too. Koreans are nice, and polite. Ask for a discount, and they'll give you."
3115,5.0,This is the place to walk around in and see the small shops where you can find almost anything. Street food galore!
3116,3.0,It's overwhelming with so many people. Go there if you have lots of energy. The skin care stores are repetitive - same brands/stores on every block or every other block. There are a lot of street food in this area too.  Good Experience South Korea's skin care/cosmetic culture.
3117,5.0,"Myeongdong is a must-not-miss shopping street. I loved all the make-up shops and you'll be happy to know most salespeople can speak English. Lots of restaurants around, but they're naturally priced for tourists. There's also the street food you must not miss. I suggest you walk through Myeongdong at night when the vibe is hip and the energy is high. Just remember to head home before the metro closes!"
3118,4.0,"Korea has normal sit in restaurants, but to get the feel of authentic Korean go sit and eat at one of Koreas street restaurants, these are the hidden gems, usually mom and pop places"
3119,5.0,"We stayed at the Metro Hotel right in this neighborhood and never tired of the food stalls and shops along the lively streets in the area. Restaurants, shops, street food abound. Try the shaved ice deserts, and the Maple Tree restaurant for barbecues. Unfortunately the fish shaped waffle with ice cream you get at the street food stall is not as good as it looks."
3120,5.0,"so much to see and eat, and of course buy! prices are also targeted at tourists. multi lingual salespersons abound. at some points, there are also guides dressed in red who would be very pleased to help you with directions or recommendations."
3121,5.0,It's cosmetics paradise with all Korean brands present. We found it to be the single largest concentration of cosmetics shops in Seoul. Staff in most shops have English speakers. Daily discounts are on and they throw freebies if you buy over an amount. We didn't find the duty free shops Lotte etc great as they tend to stock the global brands. We just went berserk shopping here. And the street food options are many and varied.
3122,5.0,"A must visit shopping street in Seoul. Street snack stalls were set up in the evening. The snacks were great, although the prices were on the high side. Cafes, restaurants, convenience stores and all kinds of shops were abundant. Great vibe and ambience."
3123,4.0,"Enjoyed the busy streets and the variety of shops around! Hawkers food carts were great, also there were many places for eating - you name it and surely you can find it!"
3124,4.0,"Good shops, but be careful of the fake items. First ask the prices and compare. Prices are different here"
3125,5.0,"This seemed the shopping area for cosmetics, and food. It was always bustling, but easy to navigate to train station, department stores, etc. Many of the cosmetic stores repeated, and when you buy something they give you samples - love it! Don't forget to ask for a tax receipt if you spend over 5000Won - you can claim the tax back"
3126,5.0,We were here last February and they had the winter sale 50-70% off on different stores and there was a street sale . Then now that its summer they have the same sale . MOstly on cosmetic products though . And oh ! Dont forget the street food ...
3127,3.0,"Lots and lots of skincare, makeup products - overrated spot with lots of tourists and the price is a rip off. Though they said its a must visit spot but actually there's lots of other places to shop off cheaper. Lots of street food but also priced higher than other places, but you'll be able to find a lot of varieties of products around.  For people whom like to shop, it's a good place to get everything at one place. They even have the famous LINE Friends cafe around here."
3128,4.0,"This is a great place if you want to buy good Korean beauty stuff, so many choices, street food are yummy and a lot to explore on the different Korean food. Clothes and women's accessories can also be found here. Affordable and enjoyable."
3129,3.0,"If you want to see what 3 different E-Tude House beauty shops have to offer within one block, this is the place to go. Blocks after blocks of face masks, face products, and other beauty products. This is, however, also the best place to go in Seoul for street food."
3130,2.0,I do not like this please very much. Whenever I am there it is because I am there in connection with something else. I only go there if I have to have a meeting or visit some friends. So not much love for the street because its noisy and not kept clean like the old days when i came to Korea first time. Lots have happened in 12 years I must say 😩
3131,5.0,"This is probably one of the most crowded places I've been to in Seoul. It's a heaven for anyone who loves make-up and skincare products. There are several restaurants in this area as well, so walk around before you decide where you wanna eat at.  Tip: come here with people who enjoy shopping as much as you do as it can get quite boring since that's all you'll be doing here."
3132,5.0,We went here almost every day. There's so much to discover. The street food is great & we ate at a few restaurants too. The shops will try to get you to go into their stores but they are super friendly & will understand when you say no. Nothing but great experiences here.
3133,5.0,If you like shopping this is the place to go with so many shops to see you won't know what to do with yourself. There is a good range of tasty street food along the pathways as well as some good market stalls selling clothes sunglasses and other items. If you like your beauty buys there are lots of shops that cater for this some expensive others cheaper. If you are from the UK you might get swamped by students asking you to do some quizzes and wanting a selfie (but they are very nice kind and polite so don't be worried). I'd say if you visit here you might want an empty suitcase to bring all the stuff you buy with you back home!
3134,5.0,"Great place to get your k beauty and shopping fix. So many shops. If you are nice you can get lots of free samples from the beauty stores. After 4 pm the food street vendors come out and the whole place becomes crazy crowded. To be honest, the street food is quite expensive. Many food items look good but only tasted so so. The swirly potato chips was a disappointment but do check out the honey comb vanilla ice cream served in a fish shaped pancake. Those were divine."
3135,5.0,I felt like a local with the shopping and street food. I had the chance to enjoy Myeongdong 3 times out of our stay.
3136,5.0,endless shopping. Lots of places to eat and if you're into Korean beauty products it is a must for your wives or girlfriends. satisfy your street food cravings !!
3137,5.0,"So much shopping to do around this area, but the main attraction for me was the street food! Do your research and eat everything at least once! Korean street food tastes great, but may not be so great for the waistline."
3138,5.0,"Myeongdong: Capitalism screaming in your face. It has a super high concentration of shops, neon lights, and food places. It is super lively and has good vibe until late in the evening"
3139,4.0,"We lived near Myeongdong station, and we shopping every night after finishing our plan. You can get street food, cosmetics, stationery here, and it's easy to exchange money, there are so many currency exchange stores on the street. If you wanna buy Korean brand cosmetics like innisfree, skinfood, laneige, tolymoly... here is the best place for you. It's lively at night!"
3140,4.0,"Fun street to come for tasting local foods, shopping for clothes and beauty products! Also has lots of restaurants around the area, dined here multiple times, although I must say that the restaurants around here have inflated prices."
3141,4.0,Place is full of people and shops. I was trying to find shot glasses but was unable to find what I was looking for. The place is great for cosmetics and there are various places to eat. They have tourist information people walking around in red cowboy hats that can answer any questions or help with directions.
3142,4.0,"Was there in May 2017 and streets appears less busy ( this is a plus)due to China banning tour groups from going to South Korea. You can find all the Korean cosmetics sold here, there are multiple Innisfree, Etude house shops in this shopping area. Just a tip, I am normally late arriving at Incheon airport , however I was early this time and had a little time to walk around. I purchased an Iope skin care product (80,000 won) before tax refund (tax refund is only about 5%) at Aritatum Myeongdong and the airport was selling it for 60,000 won! Not sure if other Korean cosmetics are cheaper at the airport as I decided not worth comparing as I didn't want to find out I had paid more for all my other purchases!  Food: lots of food being sold on carts. Drinks ( orange juice selling at 4000 won , maybe 5000 won ( can't remember exactly)... So in my opinion , not cheap. Stalls and most shops open till 11 pm."
3143,4.0,"Bright lights, hawkers shoving free samples in your hands, signs advertising huge discounts, all replicated every 50 metres in every direction, it's a recipe for credit card mayhem. Be careful if you can't resist!"
3144,3.0,"Walked around this area around lunchtime on a Sunday just to browse at the collection of shops, which were mostly cosmetic boutiques and some clothing shops. Not a lot to interest most men :)"
3145,4.0,"On my family trip to visit my brother we spent some time here. My 17 year old daughter's favorite store was Olive Young as it had so many items she has seen but had to order on line. It was fun walking around looking at things, and not too crowded."
3146,4.0,We had several evening walk in this area which was really bursting with life. A lot of interesting street food to taste and purchase.
3147,3.0,There were too many options and too many people. Most of the shops and products can be obtained at other places I think. But I did like the street food experience.
3148,4.0,"We had intentionally booked a hotel in this street as we know that it is a shopping district and lively by night. True enough, it is! The street is filled with cosmetic shops with different brands and clothing shops. There is also lots of eateries, coffee shops, convenient stores and even a bank. It is like a street mall with everything inside! At night, it is livelier with food vendors in the street and lots of people outside. You will never got tired in walking in Myeongdong."
3149,4.0,"hello, nice to see, walk through but nothing special when you already visited classic Asian cities .. plenty of shops and small food vendors ... guess a nice spot for cosmetic purchase."
3150,4.0,"We stayed at Royal Hotel Meongdong and went window shopping every night. Myeongdong presents a wide assortment of restaurants, fashion retail shops and make-up galore. Nanta Theater with the long running Cooking Nanta Show is here as well as the Meongdong Theater which has free weekend cultural performances. Prices here are reasonable and cheaper than at Korean department stores. But this is no place for haggling. There is a wide variety of street food from salmon to octopi to honeycomb ice cream to lobster(!) to eomuk (fish) cakes. Korean street food is by no means cheap and when we chose to have them for dinner, we ended up spending more than we would have had at a regular restaurant. By the way, the honey butter almonds and the yogurt almonds sold at a side street parallel to the famous Milky Bee Ice Cream are absolutely delicious!"
3151,5.0,"Korean skincare is all the rage nowadays and once you step onto Myeongdong, you will be overwhelmed by all the brands, promotions and sales! Music is constantly playing, there is delicious street food you can enjoy while checking out all the stores. Plus every time you buy, you get a bunch of freebies too!"
3152,4.0,"It is a Mecca for shoppers, especially if you love cosmetics, sneakers, sunglasses. After a bit product selection is always the same. The place is fast pacing, full of light and young."
3153,4.0,"I went there thrice and it was really crowded. Many people were looking things to buy like souvenirs, beauty products and different street food. It was really an interesting place for shopping and food tripping. The only thing I didn't like was the long queue at every shop I entered. There were items expensive and inexpensive and sometimes it was hard for me to choose because of varied choices. I also noticed couples outside having pictorials and a sort of romantic area for them :)"
3154,4.0,"Shopping and Markets close by, but the best thing here is the Street Food, great range to pick from."
3155,5.0,Great place to try street food. The street vendors don't come out until 2pm. Please make sure you try everything!!
3156,4.0,"Not sure what time the food carts are wheeled onto the street, I simply loved the variety of street food that are being sold on the street. There are spicy rice cakes, potato tornado, chestnut, noodles, banana chocolate crepes, cheese lobster etc.  There are many shops selling clothes, shoes, accessories and even optical n contact lens shops besides beauty shops.  Nice place to hang out for a taste of Korean street food especially evening time, besides shopping."
3157,4.0,Nice place. Good Street food. Lots of beauty Products. Its a must-visit if you are in Seoul! Easy to take metro to myeongdong and come hungry. I fint like Street food normally but this is something else...new tastes and fin experience 🤣
3158,4.0,"Gosh! We were amazed by the large lines of make-up stores here. From BB creams, foundations, skin care, and other beauty products. Wow! We bought so much stuff to complete our wardrobe too. Shoes, bags, and clothes for summer. Street food is best here! Love them!"
3159,5.0,Best time to visit is when the streets shop are all set up by evening sunset. Try all the delicacy and thats dinner completed. Depends on your taste to buy the food or souveniers or whatever you choose. Take your time to walk and don't rush. Look for tallest icecream and local delicacies. Location near Myeongdong train station or take a cab to be here.
3160,4.0,"Myeongdong....best visited at night... lively and bright with stalls and shops. Great street food and various goods on sale....something for everyone. The mood is casual and fun-like. If you're into Korean cosmetics, the street is lined with all of the familiar Korean cosmetic brands...you'll be spoilt for choice. I was so thrilled to fine a 'Line Friends' flagship shop there too. We visited Myeongdong a few times during my stay in Seoul and it was always a new experience..... go see yourself. Dress according to the weather as it's open-air shopping. But all's not lost as you can also hop into the shops and malls or sit in the coffeeshops and dessert shops for a short rest while enjoying a cup of coffee or slurping up a Korean ice dessert.... Do give yourself sufficient time as it's not a place to rush through or you may regret it forever...or till your next visit to Seoul..:)"
3161,5.0,"This is the fun, vibrant place to shop with an affordable price. Must-visit. We enjoyed the time to shop."
3162,5.0,This street is great fun. Loads of really cool street food. Try cake with a fried egg or tasty fried king prawn. Plenty of shops but just stayed on the street soaking up the vibe!
3163,5.0,First time being in Seoul and was taken to these fantastic streets. A must see and plenty of shops to by things to take home.
3164,5.0,"We visited late afternoon and into the evening. Fabulous choice of shops and restaurants and excellent Street food vendors. This is the place to be, it's buzzing !"
3165,5.0,"This street is great fun for visitors to Seoul, it starts late morning and runs through to about 10.00pm. It is actually a complex of lots of cross streets and easy at first to get a bit lost. The shops are mostly make up, cosmetics, cheap clothes, phone accessories, jewellery, stationery, toys and cafes. (Unexpectedly no hi fi, cameras and electronics that markets usually have) Many shops are repeated multiple times. The stalls are mostly fresh cooked foods, fruit, drinks and other snacks. Struck me as high quality and inexpensive. Note that it is also hygienic, with my partner we eat at lots of stalls without a worry. Honestly although it was all very casual we loved it and walked round for at least a couple of hours every day. The friendly atmosphere and friendly stall holders made the whole place a pleasure. Every major city should have a corner like this. One of the best tourist attractions in Seoul."
3166,5.0,"At first it seemed a bit overwhelming but after about the 3rd day into our vacation, getting through the crowd and going from store to store became second nature. Lots of food venues and stores. Also you will find lots of beauty stores. Overall a good experience."
3167,4.0,"Every major K-skincare brand has a boutique store on this street, in fact more than one. The same brand has at least two stores on the same block, and then you see them again as you keep walking. Laneige, InnisFree, Nature Republic, Holika Holika, Etude House, My Face Shop, they are all here."
3168,5.0,"This shopping street/area is huge! There are so many shops off the main street and endless side streets with shop after shop. Some of them are very expensive but you can find good deals and sales and also find some cheap good quality items. I got some pants, dresses and shirts. We also bought several souvenirs for friends and family members. We also went to a dog cafe one day and a cat cafe on another. We had some street food and it was really good. This is a must see shopping area in Seoul. I would definitely recommend going here to do some shopping, grab some delicious street food and maybe grab some drinks and pet some animals (if you are an animal lover like I am!)"
3169,3.0,"Great shopping district, especially for cosmetic, great bargain and good quality, English speaking wasn't very useful in most of the shops, watched out some restaurants, checked menu price first, socks and toys were cheap but for XL clothes will be impossible, myself unable to find any, not even in Uniquo."
3170,5.0,"If you're looking for shopping, this is the street that I recommend. It had every store that I could think of and more. All in all, prices were alright. There are also currency exchanges in the area which was very handy."
3171,4.0,Great shopping area with lots to see and experience. The place has lots of restaurants as well! And ladies can get most if not all the cosmetic brands there.

3173,4.0,"A must go and see, of course. Lots of shopping, lots to eat, either road side stalls, or restaurants. The choice is unlimited. Could easily spend half a day there, and back the second day!"
3174,4.0,All of the things you know about street food can be found here. The bazaar starts around 4pm till 10pm. It is also a giant shooping center. Everything from Korean products to Americans' can be found.
3175,5.0,Try to split your item into a little bit more than KRW 30000. So you will get instant tax refund and free gift. Than you can move to another store and do the same. Try their snack along the alleys it's delicious
3176,5.0,"That's a really great experience - to come in the evening to have a couple of bites of a local food. And to watch locals, who are so different and bright."
3177,5.0,"A very crowded place but good enough to shop some beauty products and snacks! Wow, when you just passed about 10/15 steps of your foot from entrance of the market (from myeongdong subway), theres a guy who sells the eggbuns. And it was the delicious one i have ever eaten. And also the fishcake is a must to try!"
3178,5.0,"Nice choices, excellent service and high quality goods sold in the underground shops. The shops sell Korea made goods the demand for which is low with tourists."
3179,5.0,"Place to find anything and everything a lady will like, plus tons of food around everywhere. Street food prices are a little steep though, but still taste great nevertheless. Most Street vendors operates during the evening time, morning and noon is usually just shops."
3180,5.0,"Great place to do shopping and eating lots of delicious food. Living in Hong Kong I thought it would be similarly busy but to my surprise it wasn't at all. There is plenty of place to walk around calmly, browse, eat, all day and night long."
3181,4.0,best time to visit this place is during night time. Many stores offers low price and lots of freebies during late night or almost closing time. Street foods are also a must try!
3182,4.0,"If you have limited time in Seoul, Myeongdong might be the best bet. Skincare, clothes, sport shoes, street food, café and restaurant all in 1 place. It is not necessary the cheapest but you can get almost all that I mentioned earlier. We stay near Myeongdong which was easy for food since there are a lot of restaurant and street food available. Bought great bargain sport shoes which we wont able to get back home, so that was good trip for us. Bought beautiful and nice accessories, some are more expansive than others, so do look out for those with great bargains. Bought ladies top which usually are free size and no fitting allowed. Typically they are a size M/L or the materials are stretchable, likewise some design are more than $50 which others bargain price so depends on your taste."
3183,4.0,Very busy and buzzing shopping area. Many eating places to choose from and lots of coffee shops. All the top brands and many other shops where you can shop at. Clean and even has smoking huts so people do not smoke in the streets.
3184,1.0,"A lot of shops, mainly skincare. But the salespeople where almost aggressive when they wanted you to come into the shops. Basically it's the exact same shops as everywhere, but more frantic. I seriously don't recommend it for shopping. Choose one of the biggest malls instead."
3185,5.0,"A must if you're visiting Seoul! From knock offs and food carts to high end name brand stores, you won't be disappointed!!"
3186,5.0,"Very lively , different variety of stores in each street. There's balance - one street are full of eateries , another dresses and dry goods and another street sells diff brand of skincare and another street of variety of Korean souvenirs. Along the main alley a lot of street treats and Korean specialties. Fun place to be for a tourist."
3187,4.0,"a great way to snack around and shopping in myeongdong with many free wifi hotspot.  however, do shop around for the lowest prices, and find shops with Tax Refund for tourist!  Only issue is, it is not quite easy to find restroom around the area."
3188,5.0,"Was very crowded even on a weekday afternoon. Reminded me of Ximending in Taipei in terms of scale, type of shopping available, food, and crowd.  You can find local and foreign brands here, and local snacks and push carts selling cheaper goods and clothes.  Can be too crowded to be child/stroller-friendly though."
3189,4.0,Full of animated atmosphere and full of happy mood in the street. Lots of exotic street food in every ally. It is a MUST place to visit.
3190,5.0,Here shoppers and food addicts will not be disappointed by the vast variety of products and eateries lining its streets and alleys.Special interest is street food at night.Must visit place in Seoul.
3191,3.0,"Very pushy sales people. Expensive prices compared to outside. Don't be too tempted by the ""freebies"" as they jerk up prices, then give freebies. I saw the exact same items, elsewhere for 20,000KRW and sold here for 30,000KRW"
3192,4.0,"Great place to have treats on South Koreans streets food. Mouth watering food with wide variety from fried,grilled,stuffed,soups and the list goes on."
3193,5.0,"Day or night, the Myeongdong shopping street is a fun place to go. Lots of street food in the evenings and as early as noon on weekends. Really fun and safe. Full of life and positive vibes. Store assistants shout out their offers but no hassling. They even have volunteer tourist guides, dressed in bright red, mingling with the crowd offering assistance in various languages. I consulted with some of them and their information were spot on!  There are lots of interesting shops too. What I found interesting is that the currency exchange outlets on the street offer hugely better rates than the money changers at airports in Singapore or Incheon."
3194,5.0,"This place is the go to place when you want to shop and dine in Korea. It has all the brands, local and foreign. As Korea is known for its cosmetics, this place is about 50% cosmetics.  Besides shopping, there are a lot of food stalls in the middle of the streets where you can eat to your hearts content."
3195,5.0,"Lots of great small restaurants and nightly street foods. Good way to try very a lot of different dishes. Vendors are usually younger folks, so very patient and courteous. Don't hesitate to ask"

3197,5.0,Very interesting how they have there shoppong malls setup on each building the have stores inside stores.
3198,3.0,There wasn't too much of variety stores. Mainly a lots of cosmetic stores. I liked olive and young where you could get all kinds of beauty related stuff. I did not have my passport with me so they gave me bar coded receipt and I got my tax back at the airport. There were a lot restaurants and street foods late afternoon.
3199,3.0,We stayed in this area and were on this street daily. The food stalls are delicious but really over priced. $4 for orange juice $5 for a pastry. The skin care stores that surround the streets are full of over zealous hustlers who will try to sell you everything under the sun and be very demanding about it Found it like a very less classy shinjuku

Although there's a language barrier to a certain degree, the salespersons try their best to communicate even through gestures, haha. Shops are open til late in the evening specially on weekends. I stayed for 6 nights and went to Myeongdong every single night for my shopping fix. :) My happy place in Seoul!"
3205,5.0,Had a few hours to kill. Heard about the legendary Korean skin care and face masks which one has to buy as they make great gifts. This area was teaming with shops selling face masks and skin care products. Some shops have In-House VAT refund counters. But what I absolutely loved was the street food ! Tonnes of stalls selling mouth-watering food. Had the best freshly squeezed pomegranate juice. Great way to spend a few hours.
3206,4.0,"Very nice shops, full of life. Looks like it is always beasy. Restaurants, coffee shops and lots of people in the streets during the weekend"
3207,4.0,This area is a good place to get street food and any other trinkets you need. It is filed with so many vendors and stores selling anything and everything a tourist and local may want and need. Allow yourself a couple hours here as you can get lost in the alleys that make up this shopping area.
3208,5.0,The Myeong Dong shopping streets offering a veriety of trending fashion as well as street food. It has a young atmosphere but elderly people will enjoy it as well.
3209,5.0,"the very first thing i remember about myeongdong shopping street is the free gift :) when you walk on or walk in a shop some sales promotion girl/boys will gave you free gift (usually a masker or face lotion) at noon this street is full of shop and shopper only so many beauty shop you can find here from etude, face shop, laneige, etc. for fashion there also some known brand like uniqlo, H & M, etc.  at night it changes to become centre of street culinary at myeong dong (oh my god!!) this place become so crowded and surrounded by delicious and mouth watering smell of street foods for the foodi recommend oden, toppoki, and some satay (pork, beef, chicken and seafood) the best time to go here is from 4 pm until 9 pm  i visit here on jan 17 :)"
3210,5.0,"It has been said that if u are in Korea, one must visit this place for cosmetics and food street. And yes, it was really true and we enjoyed the food too much and bought some Korean cosmetic products. Its quite pricey but worth it coz Korean beauty peoducts is one of the best and effective products for face and body care."
3211,4.0,Its the place that you can find everything you can think about. It is a place you go to spend money. Dont miss it.
3212,5.0,"Lot of shop and tourists, you can by everything. But pay attention on your wallet, you can buy street food."
3213,5.0,"Come here in the evening, it is a pure fun. Music from all over, hundreds of people roaming, dozens of cosmetic shops on every street are inviting you to come inside. Really strange for Europeans and something you imagine to be really Asian. Really worth a visit right after you arrive to Seoul."
3214,5.0,"Visited Myeongdong and loved the area so much that we came back to it everyday during my trip to Seoul. The street food is the bomb, particularly the japchae, flame grilled lobsters, and chicken skewers.  It has a great nightlife, lots of shopping, restaurants, and a youth culture."
3215,5.0,one of the place you must visit in Seoul. Full with beauty shop and shopping centers and a lot of street foods which are delicious.
3216,5.0,This is haven for shopping junkies and food addict. All put it on your list when going to Seoul. Also prepare your budget ready for bargains!
3217,3.0,"A very vibrant district of Seoul, seemingly super famed for its shopping and food.  Its easy to see why this is the case and when we arrived it was an exciting area to explore and we eagerly anticipated hitting the shops.  When we did so I can only describe the experience as disappointing. There is lots of repetition and no standout identity to what was on offer (make up aside of course)."
3218,5.0,"The shopping in the Myeondong area is great, particularly for skin care products. There are many clothes shops too but the best part is the street food at night.  This is definitely somewhere you should visit during your trip to Seoul, and I'd recommend staying in Myeongdong for your stay.  Great atmosphere."
3219,5.0,"My favourite place to stay in Seoul is around this shopping street in Myeongdong. It's perfect because you can drop all your shopping off to your room, and head down to get something to eat at any time. At night time it's a little more crazy and you'll be shoulder to shoulder with other people but you get used to it. Lots of food to choose from but most of it is the same stuff. Can get a little expensive if you get lots of food. Lots of restaurants around and plenty of stores to shop at, and the staff at the beauty stores can be pushy to get you to come in (one forced me to come in once - I just walked in then out). Goes on until usually around 11pm. Very easy to get to by public transport."
3220,4.0,"Nice place to go for shopping. There are many shops at the basement as well as on the roadside. Many varieties of goods, clothes , facial products & food along the street . Advisable to bring more cash as some vendors don't accept credit card. You can go on shopping without realising that you have spend so much."
3221,5.0,"I did not imagine I will enjoy Myeongdong. Such a nice experience esp. for street food lovers! There are lots of restos also, plus beauty products stores."
3222,3.0,"The best bit about it is the street food outside of the shops. The shopping is mostly beauty products, but still worth a visit."
3223,5.0,"I managed to find all the K-pop & K-drama actors merchandise and lots of skin care product here. Also it is a walk to the Namsan Tower. For shopaholic, this is your paradise and to find a hotel which is located in the heart of Myeongdong"
3224,3.0,"Like They are generous with samples. They will offer you free sample, mostly face mask to have you enter their shop. Lots of eateries stall in the area  Cons I dislike that mostly the cosmetic shop sell in bulk. For example, you will have to buy like 2 to 3 bottles instead of 1. And the sales could be really pushy, especially to foreigner. I was pushed to buy a eye cream at one of the shop (The S#e#). The seller told me that the price is 100.000 KRW and buy one get one. Since she was that pushy, I ended buy. But later on, I was pissed when I check on the receipt that it was actually only 50.000 KRW per bottle. So, basically I bought both those so called 'buy one get one'. I paid 100.000 for 2 bottles assuming that I got good deals, which apparently, it was 50.000 each. Stupid me.  So, shall you wish to buy there... Don't get to excited with all the buy one get one promotion or others...."
3225,5.0,"Exit 6 of Myeongdong station is the nearest to this shopping haven. We went in early May and they were having sale. We bought more than KRW500,000 of skincare from Sea N Tree. They were having 1 for 1 promotion on their Vit C Capsule Ampoule and Snail Serum which cost KRW45,000 per bottle and KRW39,000 for Hyaluron Ampoule 100ml. We received lots of free samples and 4 boxes of masks free. MCM also offered KRW30,000 off any purchase with registration of a new passport as member. For purchases below KRW300,000, you can get immediate tax refund in the shop. Above that amount, you have to claim from the airport upon departure. You can find Etude House, Innisfree, Nature Republic, Teeny Weenie, Laneige and many other Korean brands here. After 6pm, stalls start sprouting out of nowhere on the streets selling street food. Shops open daily from 11am to 10pm."
3226,5.0,Great street to stroll around when you have some free time. You can buy a lost of reasonably priced items and delicious street food. I don't think anyone should PAY to go on a tour here- just do it yourself.
3227,5.0,"My favourite part of Seoul ^^ full of life <3 lot of restaurants, fashion shops, shops with music products (kpop), also magnificent cathedral :)"
3228,4.0,"If you want to get feeling for shopping, you have to go here. Hundreds of shops and street venors. Very interesting!"
3229,5.0,"Restaurants and shopping centers has its wide variety of options. Very crowded that you cannot take a good photo alone, especially during Sundays and night time. But overall we enjoy wandering around. Enjoying the different street foods! So good! Next time we come back to Seoul we will absolutely visit this place again."
3230,4.0,"Place for cosmetics and beauty products, cheapest place for beauty products as compared to namdaemun and dongdaemum. Place is filled with food stalls and restaurants and is extremely safe. Shopping for clothes is fine too. In short, higher end shopping at dongdaemun and lower end whole sale clothing at namdaemun."
3231,5.0,This is one of my favorite thing we did on this trip to Seoul...the streets you can literally get lost in!!! Sooo much to eat and see and shop!! You need to do this!!! Koreans are excellent people very kind.
3232,4.0,Lots of shoes and clothingstores. Very close to an abundance of street food in the afternoon/evening. Seemed to be busy day and night.
3233,3.0,"Myeongdong is great for buying makeup as there are literally hundreds of makeup stores. The street food is overpriced compared to other areas but still good. It gets very busy later in the day. Shop assistants will stand infront of their store handing out beauty face masks, but only take it if you actually want to go inside their shop and buy something. If you walk in and don't buy anything they will take the mask back from you. It's like a ticket to see their products. One visit to Myeongdong is enough if you're not into shopping for beauty products."
3234,5.0,What a shopping experience. In terms of the array and diversity truly amazing. Local food offerings looked most interesting too.
3235,5.0,The street is fully of food carts in the evening. Selling Korea traditional dim sum and also popular street food.
3236,4.0,"A very convenient place to go shopping and eating if you have only little time to stay at Seoul. You can find almost every cosmetic brands here and the staff are all friendly. They are experienced and speak fluent Mandarin and English, a lot of small gifts will be given along with your bought items. Clothes and accessories sold here are trendy. Many Korean restaurants and cafe and you can rest whenever tired. One point to mention is wifi is extremely convenient because almost all cafe provide free wifi service which is very caring to tourists."
3237,3.0,a bit too touristic with repetition of cosmetic shops. Recommend if you only have few days' time in Seoul. Recommend other commercial area if you stay for more days.
3238,5.0,"Myeong dong is so cool! Cat cafes, street food paradise, shopping both cheap & upscale. We loved it so much we went back a second time in a week."
3239,4.0,"Enjoyed Myeongdong, no matter how crowded it was! The spiral potato on a stick tasted like fresh potato chips, we opted for plain salt over dipping on cheese or onion powder. We didn't try the other street foods but went to seafood and bbq restaurants instead."
3240,4.0,"Been there many times and got lost every single times! what seems like a square is actually a labyrinth with multiple junctions, hidden treasures, vibrant energy and amazing street food! Primary aim to visit Myeongdong village is hunt for cosmetics and there are plenty plenty plenty!!! Despite this need, street food is umbelievable! from fresh juice stands (pomegranate juice recommended), fried delicacies, spatial ice creams and many more, great seafoos, noodles, korean barbecue joints are to be found! Bottom line is as soon as you step in you will be teleported in one of the most dynamic experience of your life! Garanteed (except if you don't feel confortable in the crowd):)"
3241,4.0,"The minute you exit from exit 6 from the Seoul metro you see rows of street food it is such a huge place selling all different kinds of Korean cosmetics such a wide variety of choices,many branches of Nature Republic,Tony Moly,Etude House,Skinfood,etc etc. If you purchase something they give you lots of free samples like face masks,skin lotions,emulsions,toners.There are also shops selling the latest in Korean fashions which are very pretty usually in pastel colours. It is not so cheap compared to the street stalls which are cheaper.There are also many good Korean restaurants here.We had Korean BBQ which was so good.Myeondong is usually crowded especially weekends and in the evenings."
3242,4.0,It is a shopping huge area with lots of streat food. I used to go there in the evening after sightseeing. You can do shopping and taste food It is safe and you find cafes as well
3243,5.0,"This is a must visit for shopaholics. You can find literally every thing from almost every brand, be it luxury or local. You cannot finish strolling all the streets in just ine day. I have been there for several times and every time I discovered something new. Even if you don't love shopping, you have to go there for the wide array of street foods it has to offer. You can also find some halal street foods there. Honey garlic shrimp and barbecue chicken has been my favourites. These shops are usually open till late so I suggest visiting at night. This place has something for everyone."
3244,5.0,"If you don't know what to choose from hundreds of different korean cosmetic brands, myeongdong is the best choice to come. Why? Because all brand clustered together in this one area. They also usually have different promotion than stores outside myeongdong.  If you're hungry, you can go to the famous myeongdong gyoza to have some noodles and dumplings. Or for K-pop lovers, you can go to YG republique for some BBQ. The restaurant is privately own by YG entertainment. You can ezpext to see handsome servers there😊"
3245,4.0,"Good variety of street food and shops. You can find things like mochi stuffed with red bean and fresh strawberry, fried prawns, baked lobster, egg bread, fish cakes, many things on skewers, and ice cream. It's crowded but manageable."
3246,4.0,We went here and since its a weekend its a bit crowded. Good thing the deals from the stores are worth for grabbing especially the cosmetics.
3247,5.0,"It's a wonderful shopping area with lots of shops selling fashion and cosmetics. There are restaurants, both indoor and outdoor, every here and there. Stalls are along the streets starting from late afternoon to late at night, selling wonderful snacks mostly. You can also find very good quality strawberries at very affordable prices."
3248,4.0,Myeongdong Street Food is the best i have tasted in Asia. They even have cheese baked live scallop and lobster! The promegenate juice is delicious and healthy too!
3249,5.0,Went to this food street on our first night in Seoul! There were so many food choices. From salty to sweet myeongdong street will not disappoint. Fairly priced you can find many snacks to munch on as you explore.
3250,5.0,Great selection of street food. Reasonable prices. Some of the street vendors move from day to day so may look different the next day.
3251,3.0,"Pricey street food, cheaper food elsewhere. Shopping is good as many streets and shops available. Beware of taking free masks as price is being pulled into shops for sales talk to buy more masks!"
3252,4.0,"This is good for shopping and dining , but too crowded bec of the street food lining up the center of the main street! If only this could be placed on another street, will be less crowded, and much cleaner. The mask and skin care shops are too much like one brand can be seen every 500 meter walk; the store sellers speak good mandarin but poor english sad to say."
3253,4.0,There are so many brands of skin care and cosmetic products that you will be spoilt for choice. It's also a great place for food like the famous Korean fried chicken and BBQ meals.
3254,5.0,"I love this place! Myeongdong is the fashion capital of Korea. If only I have enough space in my luggage I would have loved to do more shopping in this area. You can buy everything in myeongdong, from clothes to accessories to skin care and so on and so forth. It's simply amazing!"
3255,3.0,"I really didn't see the ""so called bargains"" people spoke of. You either had over priced designer labels being purchased by people who were more concerned about the label than the quality or cheap stuff being sold in stalls that will fall apart after ne use. The primary shops are for skin creams and cosmetics."
3256,4.0,A lot of information from all different directions. Shop all you want and eat street food as well. Prices can be quite expensive since its an obvious tourist trap but convenience is definitely there.
3257,4.0,"Range of shops is the most interesting out of all the shopping areas. However, street food is more expensive. So for items that are pretty common, such as the egg bread and rice cakes, it's better to buy them at other areas like Hongdae instead where it's 500 won cheaper. However, Myeongdong offers other street food that other areas do not have to cater to tourists, such as seafood. And not forgetting, there's an innisfree / skinfood / nature republic / faceshop almost every corner you turn, so it's a great one-stop place to get all your beauty products."
3258,5.0,"Went there twice in my 3 days there. Lots of street food, toiletries, small local restaurants and shopping."
3259,5.0,"Great for people watching as well as shopping! Lots of quaint tea houses and coffee shops! Many art galleries and street food vendors as well! Popular with young and old, families and singles! A must do while visiting Seoul!"
3260,5.0,Great to go around and just get lost in the midst of the vendors and tourists.  Don't come too late though as Koreans are early birds so when we arrive here at 20:00 most of the vendors are already getting ready to close.
3261,2.0,"Myeongdong is a busy but not so great shopping area in Seoul. Most of the shops are high end cosmetics shops and the rest are typical mall-type stores. There is street food, yes, but there is street food everywhere in Seoul and is better elsewhere. Check out Insadong, Bukchon Hanok, Dongdaemon, or the Hongik University area if you want to shop and eat among the crowds. Myeongdong, to me, feels more like a tourist invention."
3262,4.0,This area has a lot of gift shops and great selection of street food. Lots of things that catch young children's attention.
3263,5.0,With so much going on this is certainly an attack on the senses! Shopping and ratting galore! I even found a cat cafe here!
3264,5.0,"it was a nice street , nice cafe, nice market, every things was beautiful..don't miss visit this street..i love seoul🇰🇷"
3265,5.0,"A place with ambience and so many great choices for food whether it's morning or night. Great place to get the best rates for exchanging currency. Beauty products, clothes, street food, desserts, street entertainment and to get a feel of seoul!"
3266,5.0,"I just love this street. It is full of life and everything you need and don't need. This trip was my 6th time to Korea and my second time to this street. First time was 7 years ago. Not that much have changed however I remember mostly the cosmetic shops from back then and that my suitcase was full off free samples from all the cosmetic shops that they give you when you enter and they let you keep it even if you don't buy anything. This time I felt there were clothes stores and everything of the latest fashion. I went in the morning and the streets were not so crowded as I had expected so that was nice. I was also impressed by seeing a 24 hour adidas shops. A real gem is a shop called Å. I forgot the full name but it has 4 floors with different things like clothes, bags, shoes and accessories. And even one vintage floor. Just love this shop and was glad to find it again. Myeongdong can easily be reached by subway. From there I used goodly map and walked to insadong. It was not far."
3267,3.0,"It's a very popular with street food,and kosmetik store. It's not open 24 hour.when i go there,there start to close at 10.00pm"
3268,3.0,We have been to better market in terms of choices as well as bargaining with the vendors compared to this place. My personal view is that it was just average. Literally average!
3269,5.0,"We stayed at Hotel Shin Shin which was a 10 minute walk from the Myeongdong Shopping Street. We frequently visited the Myeongdong markets, which came alive at night time with the many food trucks. There's a lot of food to choose from and the shops were good too."
3270,5.0,Had to admit we kept coming back here to shop. Really nice place to shop till you drop. Definitely a must go if you want to do a lot of shopping. You can also buy delicious delicacies at the stalls along the shopping street when you are hungry. There are also halal food around.
3271,5.0,We spent an afternoon here mainly for my wife. The place focuses mainly on skincare and makeup products but if you from a western country - you will find that it's probably cheaper to buy foreign brands at home than here. It's probably better value to get Korean brands that are both cheaper and not available in your country.  Lately the crowds here have thinned due to Chinese sanctions on tour groups but its still fairly huddle and bussle.  There are many street food carts lining the streets. The variety is good but prices are much higher than in the markets nearby (nandamen)  Most stores you just need to buy 30k won and you will get immediate tax refund. Save the hassle at the airport!
3272,3.0,Myeongdong is a very nice place to visit however there are not many things to buy. A visit is enough.
3273,5.0,"Myeongdong street is your go-to place if you want to try their street food and if you wanna go shopping. There are a lot of stores that you can visit and buy stuff. Further, there are different restaurants you can indulge yourself with Korean food. As for me, this is my fave spot. You can encounter different nationality in this place."
3274,5.0,"Its an every Woman's dream to be in one place for all their beauty, skin care and the what not. This place is like heaven on earth for Women. For the street food fanatics this street also will not disappoint. It has everything in one single place, its like a complete package."
3275,4.0,Myeongdong shopping street was a great place to spend a couple of hours to taste Korean street food and do some light shopping. The streets are very clean and a ton options on food. If your not into street food there are even more restaurants to choose from.
3276,5.0,Many many cosmetic stores which offer best price. Best products. And best brands. Heaven on earth for ladies.. prepare your wallet.. 😍😍😍
3277,4.0,"Yes, it is a place to shop till you drop. Well, if you have much money then you can try shopping in Myeongdong. There are cosmetics, clothes, and others you can buy. Because there are so many cosmetics stores, then they offer various discounts for their products. Too bad, I do not wear cosmetics, so I am not interested in them."
3278,5.0,"It is across the street from our hotel, i loved it and visited nearly every day special at evening. Lots of shops cloths and lots lots of skin care shops i think all the Korean cosmetics brands have more than branch there. At 10:00 pm most shops close but the street food start from afternoon till after 12:00 am different kind of food snack seafood dessert and juices. Really It fun experience and it is must for anyone visiting Seoul."
3279,5.0,"We visit few recommended shopping areas and found Myeongdong to be it for us. It is a bit more expensive but it has a lot more shop and offer wider range. Having said that if you expect cheap it, this is not the place. Here you can shop till you dropped and that is what we did for few nights."
3280,3.0,"...yet nothing I really wanted to buy. I was told ""if it's not in Myeongdong, it's not in Korea"". It gets a bit repetitive tending towards boring if you don't want to buy bags, hats, womens clothing or jewelery"
3281,5.0,You can find so many korean cosmetics stores here and actually korean food streets !! Soooo deliciousss !! But when in adidas store I can't found NMD shoes :(( thats happening now right ?!
3282,5.0,"i stay at seoul for 11days and i went there for 6times 😂 its heaven for makeup lovers. There are halal food. kebabs, bun & nutella crepe."
3283,4.0,"Myeongdong was actually the most favourite shopping street of our family in Seoul! There was a lot of nice shops and restaurants around the area. The whole area, also, turned into vibrant and lively at night with hundreds of food stalls along the streets, so it might be looked like a food street rather than a shopping one."
3284,5.0,I have never seen such a busy place ever. There are streets of shopping and crowds everywhere. There's restaurants and a variety of local and international brands of cosmetics and clothes . Many many skin care products to be found here. Shoppers paradise.
3285,5.0,"I was only here a short time, what a pity!! It has amazing restaurants, stores, and shops. I didn't get to visit any, but I did try the street food and ohhh it was amazing!! Also, i went to the underground shopping area and I barely had time to stop by a huge kpop store where the CDs were cheaper than I had ever seen before while staying in chuncheon or in America. I am definitely going to explore this area more when I come back. I did visit the Myeongdong in Chuncheon so i imagine it is similar and I seriously love that Myeongdong!!"
3286,5.0,"I loved this area! Lots of shops (many cosmetics shops), street Food and action. The Place to be in the evening in Seoul!"
3287,4.0,"Shops after shops of skincare products! We could also shop for other stuff such as apparel and souvenir too. A wide array of restaurants and cafes around each corner. In the evening the street transforms into a night market with lots of street food and stalls selling socks, bags, etc."
3288,4.0,"Loved this shopping street. All sorts of things is here. Skin care, bags, shoes, dress. Everything! And its cheap too. ❤️"
3289,4.0,"What is good in this place is that beginning after lunch, the street becomes a pedestrian street which plenty of food stalls set ups. Great Street food!!! Good place to do window shop."
3290,3.0,"We wandered down this shopping area on our way back from Easter Mass @ The Cathedral on Easter Sunday Morning. Lots of little shops,bars,cafes & small service entities adorn Myeongdong Shopping Street. Sadly there were very few sales on,making a lot of goods quite expensive even by our standards in Australia. Myeongdong has its own Metro Station & is an enjoyable place to go shop watching & leave your purse/wallet in your pocket or purse. Interesting place,albeit would not go there by choice"
3291,4.0,This place is really hectic at all times of the day.Great for buying beauty products and has some nice restaurants near by.
3292,4.0,"We stayed in Myeongdong area. It's a crowded and vibrant area, restaurants and street food cater to different needs, however, it does have a 'go-to-rest' time. Most shops, restaurants and all street food carts will closed for the day around 10-11pm. Most staff in shops and waitresses in restaurants can speak Mandarin & English. Expect street food to be tourist price."
3293,5.0,"This was across the street from our hotel. We had so much fun trying the food. You could get lost around the streets but its easy to navigate. And in anycase, you can do a lot of people watching and make up shopping while waiting"
3294,3.0,"It is a busy shopping street for tourists and locals. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from, and at night time there is also street food available."
3295,3.0,"We drop by this place 3 times in our trip mainly because it opens til later at night. Surprisingly... not beyond 9pm... as vendors and shops start to close their businesses. Crowded and can be overwhelming at times, and some vendors can be rather rude. Overall, still a must visit place when you are in Seoul."
3296,4.0,"It's rarely quiet in this famous street. Cosmetics lovers, fashion, shoes, to bags and everything in between will love this shopping paradise as it offers so many varieties, brands, and style. And those foodies also will enjoy the delicasies. The trends could be changing from time to time but you'll be sured to have fun and getting the tummy filled. During our visit, cheese lobster, scallop, prawns, chickens, candies, crepes are a huge thing. Around 7 yeard ago it's more like fear factor with crickets, worms, and all those critters. cosmetics wise, Korean brand are on the rise, their lipsticks are pigmented, their skincare has wide variety and they are creating their own line that are leading. Walking in this street could be challenging with the crowds and sellers offering people to buy or go to the stores, so embrace yourself. Carry only what's needed and always pays attention. We never experience crime like pickpockets or stuff like that but still, do be careful. Do visit the place around night as the food stalls comes by during that time. Or if you only wants to shops, day time is best as the streets is not yet flooded with those delicious stalls."

3298,5.0,We spent hours strolling around the quaint little streets filled with lots of interesting people. Worth a visit.
3299,3.0,"Alot of shops, restaurants and street food. Most of the street food quite pricey, though. Very crowded. Quite a few cars coming to the pedestrian areas, very annoying."
3300,5.0,"All you need is here!!!!! Food, masks, massage, fashion stuffs. It's a total heaven but your wallets might suffer as there's too much temptations around.  There's lots of legit massage parlours around (all located at 3/4th floors above the shops) with really good service too! A foot massage costs about 18,000 wons for 40minutes. Highly recommended to relieve your muscles."
3301,4.0,"We love shopping @ Myeongdong Street. The place is always alive. Very accessible and cheap. So many shoppers in and out of stores. And food stalls and carts lined up the street so you'll never get hungry. There are a lot of stuff to buy specially cosmetics at discounted prices. And there are always freebies given away. Every time we go to Seoul, we make sure to allot 1 day of shopping in Myeongdong."
3302,3.0,Not much variety in shops. Mostly cater to skin and hair care and personal grooming products. Crowded with tourists.
3303,5.0,"Myeongdong offers you everything!!! Delicious street food, super cheap quality cosmetic product, fine korean restaurant, trendy fashion store, to foot massages when you fell your foot is killing you but you still need those pairs of eye mask.  Came here 3 times in my 6 days visit to south korea but havent managed to explore all areas and still hugely want to come back.  Do ask for a tax return form because it was surprisingly easy to process my tax return at the airport."

3307,4.0,"Tourist spot for Korean cosmetics and apparels. Nothing to worry about if you're tired from walking, hopping from one store to another as food stalls are everywhere at the middle of the road. Restaurants and fine dining are also abound. I always come back here for the Dakgalbi rice at Yoogane; great way to restore your energy after walking around the streets of Myeongdong. You can also choose to relax at Lotte mall and even watch a movie if you want to; they play english movies too!"
3308,5.0,This is the place you need to go to buy cosmetics and beauty products. It has the best brand of cosmetics. There's also good street food.
3309,4.0,Myeongdong is a place not to miss. You can get everything and anything you need. Korean cosmetics brand easily accessible in just one street/area. From high end Korean cosmetics to pocket friendly ones. Things you need before buying is more arm power and deeper pockets.
3310,4.0,"This is the area if you want to shop till you drop. I was looking for gift ideas for all my family members and manage to get them all something. Lots of small gift shops, plenty of different food items, coffee shops, etc in this area. The crowds are plentiful but you can manage to get around."
3311,5.0,"Our hotel was right here and there were rarely any dull moments.  From the shops, the food carts that are out as soon as the afternoon to late at night, the droves of people and the whole culture in itself is an experience.  Try to book a hotel in the area, you wont be disappointed."
3312,4.0,"Myeongdong is very packed with people. It is the place to look for Korean skincare and cosmetic products. Shop assistants will always try to lure you into their shops by giving away free sheet masks. This is also the place to buy the famous Korean socks. You can find a variety of street food here as well. My personal favourite is the deep fried twisted potato. Overall, this is a great place for shopaholics."

3315,5.0,"From apparels, makeup to food, this part of Seoul is not to be missed. It is always bustling with life and full of surprises. The MCM boutique is a must visit if you don't want to be disappointed by the lack of items in the latest collection. Stylenanda's Pink Hotel boutique offers a different view of shopping experience with different theme on each floor, and mostly clad in pink! The street comes alive in the evening with food stalls on carts. if you run out of luggage space, there are shops readily available to see to your needs. Tired legs? The streets are clad with cafeterias and restaurants perfect to rest your feet and fill your hungry stomach."
3316,4.0,"First time in Myeongdong....lots of face, body and hair products. Enjoy the street food....but it's surely more pricey than local food market. Nice cool weather today for walk along shops in Myeongdong"
3317,5.0,There is really no other place quite like this! Its def worth checking out during the day and the evening. As its very different. Lots of great korean beauty products on offer.
3318,5.0,"Meongdong is one of the most visited streets in korea. I see many foreigners here, and everyone seems to be enjoying this place. This is one of the must visit places in korea!!!! Highly recomend it!!!!!!"

3320,5.0,"My daughter and I had a great time shopping here. She loves Korean cosmetics and they have it all. Late in the afternoon , all of the food vendors come out . Lots of delicious snacks and drinks."
3321,4.0,Huge shopping mall with every designer label you can think of. Food court on lower floor and food was good with huge selection.

3323,4.0,"This is the place to sample street food, the ones you don't normally find in your hometown, its not cheap but what the heck, you're on holiday & you want to give it a try. Shopping is the other magnet here, you'll find all the international brands plus some local ones, especially in cosmetics. Its something akin to Osaka's Dotonburi. Overall well worth a visit."
3324,5.0,"Just like what you have read or heard. It is the busiest district, filled with shops, stalls and restaurants. Go there hungry and try all the Korean famous street foods for average of KWR 30/dish. Probably too squishy for little children. Not so stroller friendly as the place is often packed with tourists."
3325,4.0,"Myeongsont Shopping Street is a good place for, well, shopping. There is a hotel that sits around the district & what our Filipino community recommends is to stay there, we opted not to because we knew that there will be a lot of people.  I gave it a 4 star is because we were able to go to a place were there is less people & have the same shops so to me, it's just the hype."
3326,5.0,"Well known for their beauty shops, in fact a bit too much of in your face selling. Shoving masks in your hand , left right and.center. Apart from that, plenty of delicious food, cafe's of all types and night street food. Must go and stay place."
3327,5.0,"This is a great place for shopoholics and for people who savour street food. Most of the food vendors put up there stalls post 5 pm , so if you are visiting the street post 5pm you will find great food options with amazing vibe all over the area. Its definitely worth visiting once for shopping and interesting food vendors."
3328,5.0,"So much shops, and street food. One can collect face masks by just going inside beauty shops. Although prices are not really that cheap as buying them online, it is still one of the highlights of our Seoul trip."
3329,4.0,"This is a great place to experience a real ""open market"". Endless vendors for clothing, souvenirs and food. Shop where the locals shop!"
3330,3.0,My 2nd visit and yes lesser Chinese but more Indonesian and Vietnam people. Otherwise lesser crowded now and thus easier to shop
3331,4.0,"Shopping, shopping and shopping. The main street is crowded with food stalls and each corner leads to yet another shop. Recommend a walk around even if you're not up for shopping just to get a feel of the shopping craziness."
3332,4.0,"Thriving shopping street in Seoul. Lots to see, lots to buy, lots to eat. My personal favorite shops are Stylenanda a boutique fashioned in the style of hotel, Aland a boutique selling fashionable clothes by local designers - but the decor is interesting - with worn & torn leather chairs, old luggages, really old radios & more. Go see for yourself if you are in Myeondong"
3333,4.0,"Young people would like this place as it has lots of shops catered for them. Food is readily available too. It feels like Ximending of Taipei. There are many restaurants and street food but the street food aren't cheap.  Clothes are also not the cheapest here. I personally feel clothes are cheaper in subway basements where most things go for 10000won. Here they may cost about 20 to 50% more.  Still, a must visit for anyone visiting Seoul for the first time."
3334,5.0,"One of the highlights of my trip. Myeongdong is packed with stores, stalls, and delicious street food!!! It has a lot of alleys with stunning neon lights at night. Make sure to allot at least 3-4 here because there's just so much to do!!"

3337,5.0,"Interesting market. Has good shops on both sides of the streets, and vendors in the middle of the streets. Very energetic. Vendors range from those selling socks and battery operated children's toys to food carts with the preparation of foods in full view, be it pomegranate juice or potato chip skewer. One particular attraction was a lady adding simple sugar in a small bowl and stirring it over a bunsen burner and converting it to candy..a big hit with children. Another area with long lines was a soft icecream vendor. His attraction was a cone of icecream that was 32 cm. high. No kidding! Lots of interesting vendors and lots of crowds and high energy. Loved it! A must visit market!"
3338,5.0,"You can buy everything here, cosmetics, great street food, clothes, exchange your money. It's crowdy, specially during weekends, but worth visiting."

3343,3.0,"This is my second time to be here and i will be here again because my friends never been to Seoul before. This place is full of clothes-selling shops, eateries and massage shop. I dislike to be here because it is so crowded and the average service attitudes. It is easy to get lost here, since many alley and not much public toilets available"
3344,4.0,"Nice to visit and experience locals, food and items that can be brought home. Recommended stop after visiting serious stuff"
3345,4.0,"Very crowded, a lot of street food, a lot of vendors, and a lot of stores for clothing and cosmetics. It is a great tourist spot for shopping and food, a little to crowded for my liking but still a good and seems to be a safe spot to visit."
3346,5.0,"If you looking for street food, this is the right place to go because street food everywhere in here and not just street food u can buy cosmetics in here too."
3347,2.0,"I like to shop in myeongdong but most of the staffs were not friendly. They know how to speak in multi languages like mandarin, Japanese, english etc. They are very aggressive but they didn't listen to what you need. However there are few shops with nice staffs too but can be counted using one hand."
3348,5.0,"Arrived at 9pm on a Friday and it was packed. Vast area with brand name stores that you see on 5th Ave, but also small bargain shops and street vendors."
3349,4.0,"We enjoyed window shopping in this area, but really didn't too high end for us. We did enjoy a nice lunch in the food court in the basement of the Lotte Department store. Lot's of good items to choose from."
3350,3.0,"Taking a break from work, we decided to go shopping. Lots of nice local stuff and some traditional retailers. But, it would help to speak Korean to get the real deals. We felt like being American was a disadvantage. The jewelry was nice and there was some negotiating starting at 30% off and going as far as 35, but it still seemed high."
3351,5.0,"This was one of the best parts of my trip. I took the blue line Subway and changed to the 4 line and went shopping. This place has many many makeup stores and discounted prices. In the evening or late after noon there are food vendors set up all along the streets. There are also great restaurants on the side streets. There are department stores as well as boutiques. I am large compared to the locals but I found a sweater coat, a shirt as well as face masks, eyebrow pencils, lipsticks that would go well with my dark skin color also. It was just great. I went back three times during my time in South Korea."
3352,3.0,"Myeongdong Street market is a lot like an outdoor mall. It had all the big, brand name stores like Forever 21 and Zara. In my opinion, it was a little bit of a let down to learn that the street vendors, including the street food, didn't come out until night time. But it's certainly a good area to walk through, though I would not say its cheaper in Korea if you're shopping at the brand name stores."
3353,5.0,"Visited the street with two young (and fussy) eaters at around 7pm at night and must have gained 4lb in weight!? Gorged ourselves on dumplings, Korean fried chicken, grilled steak, spiral potatoes, cheesey hash brown type things, strawberries and honey goldfish ice creams. Fresh, affordable and delicious. The subway is nearby, taxis are cheap and easy to find and if you need help there is a tourist police office in the middle and at the end of the street"
3354,5.0,you can shop for anything over here. Best known for make up things .A few big Shopping Mall caters for all need
3355,4.0,"A very big place to shop, dine and drink coffee to relax. Especially for the ladies. Alot of cosmetic shop to get all your facial and bodies needs. Basically, i like the street food compare to the restaurant."
3356,4.0,"Came here for the Nanta Show and loved all the great street food! My favorites were the mandoo (dumplings) and spicy beef meatballs. Lots of shopping, especially of beauty products. Easy to get disoriented since the same shop will be in 3 or more locations, so you may want to stop by the tourist information area to get a map that shows the names of all the stores on it. There are also 3 movie theaters in this area."
3357,5.0,"so much fun here, ate to much, drink to much!, bought to much!.....lobsters, abalones, hot dogs, juices, etc etc"
3358,5.0,"The cosmetics there doesn't stick in one price and the prices are negotiable. They even gave us free gifts and extra samples. Tax rebate is up to certain amount. Besides shopping, there are nice street food everywhere too! Don't forget to try the caramel sugar!"
3359,5.0,"Can be overwhelming but is a must see - great for shopping, especially for skin products. At night the food stalls start selling all kinds of street food."
3360,5.0,"You can probably find everything in Myeongdong area, we had lunch, shopping, dinner and more shopping there! You will definitely need to bargain for price with Street vendors!! We got ripped off on those seaweed snacks and found much cheaper ones in supermarket nearby! But it was a lot of fun trying street foods from those vendor stores!"
3361,4.0,Yes this street is renowned for its shops that sell beauty products but we really have to talk about the great street food available on the weekends. Go around late afternoon when all the stalls have set up for the evening.
3362,5.0,"Myeongdong was an absolute madhouse and I enjoyed every second of it. We did very little actual shopping here but visited three times just for the fun of it. At night, the main street had a couple dozen food stalls. I tried about five of them one night and they were all delicious. If nothing else, you've got to come here to experience the mass of humanity and light and sound."
3363,5.0,I super love the place! We came here three times during our stay at Seoul. If you love beauty products this is the place to go. There also a lot of street food to try and also boutique shops and all. We also got our souvenirs bought here. A must go place in Seoul.

3368,4.0,Whole street is full of Korean cosmetics. Sales people are friendly and always give out free goods. Opens til midnight.
3369,2.0,"For one of the most visited destinations in Seoul, I found this place to be pretty disappointing. The street food and carts are what carry it, any other kind if shopping is the same as you would get anywhere else..."
3370,4.0,"Lots of cosmetic stores, Korean brand stores and some fun malls. I recommend going in the later afternoon when the food vendors set up and you can snack your way around as you shop."
3371,4.0,"The buzz of this place esp. in the afternoon when the street food vendors bring their offers, is electrifying. Shop assistants will give you free samples to get you in their shops and spend your money on face mask, fancy clothes and shoes or bags. When you're hungry you simply stop halfway of the street width at nearest vendor for variety of treats or get a green tea latte from a regular coffeshop snd you are good to continue. Shop, shop, shop."
3372,4.0,"If your a shopper it's great ! First time visitors is a must, good products and famous shopping district. Good to explore if your into these kinda things but as you walk around the streets a bit more the shops get repetitive - same shop same brands same products, probably each shop you will see more than 15 times.. You might even see the same people haha Truman Show alike. For the Bloggers it is not similar to Orchard, Pitt Street, Bourke Street or even KLCC - it's original in its own sense. ( sorry read too many blogs and it kept saying it's Orchard and CWB)"
3373,3.0,"If you are looking for a traditional Korean market, this isn't it.  This is a very commercialised area, very, very crowded, with many chain stores. No low prices. It's fun to look around, but is you want deals, go elsewhere.  If crowds, loud noises and rude, pushy people bother you, don't go here!  Best thing about this place is the street food, and there are some very good local and western restaurants."
3374,3.0,"Very busy shopping area. Lots of small inexpensive stores. Dirty, noise, overcrowded. Not much fun, don't lose your time"
3375,4.0,Food is good. But people behave like from the Middle Ages. Korean ladies pushing their way through and even manhandle passerby just to get through
3376,3.0,"I heard from a local that Koreans don't go there anymore since it has become very touristy place and prices had gone up dramatically.  Still I went there, only to find he was right. The street feels like a show for tourist with shops and food street but not a real local place like Hongdae for example. It is very crowded and big but with not soul.  Only places which are interesting are the Lotte department store, the Lotte young plaza and the big Uniqlo branch (which doesn't have XXL for men at all, so if you're a big guy, forget about it)"
3377,4.0,Alive and bustling. Truly a visual treat for the senses. Cosmetics and skincare mecca for anyone who is looking to stock up. Plenty of shopping and eating places as well as hotels. Gets very crowded on weekends but all is good. People/vendors are polite and making their way to places they want to go without pushing or shoving despite it being crowded.
3378,4.0,"This is the place for beauty product lovers! My wife had a blast at Myeongdong, and our hotel was strategically located here as well. Shopping all day and lots of restaurants around for sustenance in between. If you are a foreigner, bring your passport for duty free discount."
3379,4.0,"If shopping is your thing, then this is a good place for you. Rows and rows of shop selling beauty products and a lot of street food around as well. Some brands are repetitive though. Definitely recommend for those who loves cosmetic and beauty product ,you will be spoil with so many choices."
3380,3.0,"Was excited to see all the street food stands until I walked around for awhile and saw that they were all repeated several times. Same with the street vendors for like hats, etc. Otherwise, it's mainly cosmetics and some clothing stores and not that exciting."
3381,5.0,This is a great place to buy Korean cosmetics as all of the shops are in one place and they seem to repeat on every block. There is also some great street food and restaurants to eat at along the way. Lots of great shops and interesting things to buy. It gets very busy so be prepare for some crowds. Try the Hotteok! :)
3382,4.0,"Felt like they have thousands of shops just selling cosmetic...plenty of restaurant to choose from...if you are not a shopper, just go there and look at the foot traffic - can see all kinds of people..."
3383,5.0,"Wow! If your intention is to shop beauty products, this is the place. All along the street, it's difficult to decide in which one to buy. Walk also through the little streets on the corners, you might find some different things."
3384,5.0,"So many shops for make up, cosmetics, accessories, eateries (at night), restaurants during the day, shoes, etc."
3385,5.0,"Just prepare your Korean won and walk along the street. If you have nothing to buy ,just enjoy the food. From Halal Kebab right up to the lobster cooked with cheese. Oh man...it is soo delicious."

3387,3.0,"I have heard about this place from so many people and finally i make it here myself. There were lots of China tourist filled up most of the shops.... prices are no longer as attractive due to all these over demand, We can now buy the products online from the Korean retailer at cheaper price and send right to your door step."
3388,5.0,"I simply adore outdoor market. Whether you are a big shopper at heart or you just want to window shop, this is a place to experience. I ended up with more stuff than I intended to get, but it was so fun. The Asian side of me enjoyed bargaining; and teasing of the vendors. One shop owner ended up giving me lots of extra 'samples'; and sent me off with ""I love you"" after I bit him farewell with 'Happy New Year'.  On the eating side, I watched two guys made a fresh fish cake stick a size of my arm; and resolved to try one. I would say that if my stomach is tribble size in capacity, I probably would be eating all evening walking around there. It is simply entertaining just to see all the different street food. If you are a foodie, go nuts!"
3389,4.0,"Many many brands (mostly cosmetics) along the street and many interesting street food. As a muslim traveller, I was very happy to have found a few halal stalls and 1 restaurant which provided halal dishes. The duty free mall and underground shopping centre are also worth visiting!"

3391,4.0,I took my family to Seoul for a long weekend and I wanted them to experience a outdoor market. Considering my daughter isn't quite ready to go native we went to the Myeongdong market. The kids enjoyed the banana crunch crape and they were exited to experience the energy.  Getting around Seoul by subway is easy. We let our daughter figure out how to get there and she did very well. Being outside in March is a little cool temperature wise so dress warm.
3392,4.0,Shopping paradise for ladies. Lot of cosmetic shops with offers. Lot of must try street food stalls. Also other restaurants like cat-cafe and dog-cafe are there. Interesting visit.

3395,5.0,"As KOREANS are well kwonn with their pristine face skins, here is to find out how they make that.  A chic place to do shoppings or even just to spend some time enjoying the environement.  The street foods are great. Try and share 2 or 3 foods with your travelling mates"
3396,4.0,"Very crowded place. You can easily get lost. Tourissm information bureau, in middle of Namdaemun street, is helpful. Difficult to find English speaking Koreans. But worth to visit and watch people and enjoy atmosphere. Visited alpha store nearby. It is a real heaven for handcrafters."
3397,4.0,Loved it all especially the street food and cute stuff! Overload of cuteness I. Korea. Lots of coffe shops made it a great place to wander and rest in no particular order.
3398,4.0,"This street is full of Korean cosmetic leading brands. Several shops fir the same brand in a row. I don't use make up; but I am fond of skin care products. On purchase of 35,000 Wong the shipping becomes tax free. Innisfree and Lotte duty free refund tax in the store. All other stores provide a coupon that can be claimed at the airport. I could find all korean brand outlets. Tonymoly was only available in Lotte duty free 11F. Nature republic had but 1 get one free offer so was a good buy!"
3399,5.0,"This is a good place to have different types of street food,expensive but worth it. The one I loved was the cheese lobster, but some other were also good.  If you want to have your lunch here, be prepared to expend a lot of cash, but if you just try it as some snacks is ok."
3400,5.0,"This place is a must visit for anyone visiting Seoul. Even if you are not planning to buy any makeups, I think it is worth visiting to feel the atmosphere. A lot of nice and unique street food sold in the area too. Moreover, because the place is very touristy, most sellers and waiters in restaurants can speak English."

3404,4.0,"Myeongdong is a 'must' visit place for visitors to Seoul . The place opens around 10am and closes around 11.30pm. This shopping belt is world reknown for its shops and stores selling branded cosmetics. Other items sold include clothes and footwear.  For the more adventurous, do try the hawker fare selling baked scallops, baby lobsters, croissants. As they are freshly baked, the risk of developing a bad tummy is very minimal, I should think. There are also numerous small and mid size restaurants offering Korean bar-b-q of grilled fish, beef , pork and chicken. For those who like to taste local Korean cuisine, visitors will be spoilt for choices. All orders come with a serving of kim chee , bean sprouts and vegetables . Rice is an optional order .  I was there twice , and tonight I enjoyed being there just soaking up the atmosphere to see the huge crowds streaming in and the neon lightings similar to what you can see in Times Square though not as magnificent.  The place is highly recommended."
3405,5.0,"My favorite thing on my Korea trip was definitely shopping in Myeongdong. Excellent street food, restaurants, beauty stores, and right by the subway station. The employees in the stores were nice and also spoke English. You can also ask for discounts and samples and they will usually give them to you which was great! Loved Myeongdong and I wish I could go there again!"
3406,5.0,"Best place in Seoul. Best place for shopping and other things. There are many restaurants, cafes, etc. There are even theme cafes here, I visited many cat cafes, dog cafes.. My hotel was here, I never regretted the location, best location ever. Visited in Summer of 2015"
3407,5.0,This place really wakes up later in the day. If you're looking for somewhere to go early in the day this isn't the place. The range of shops and street food available is plenty and very affordable too. You'll end up eating at every stall!
3408,5.0,"I like myeong dong the best in Korea, a lot of street food 🥘 along the way with the shopping mall , and good food restaurant is all around. You can explore a lot of stuff in here , I went here during January and is the coldest winters time month. I will come here again 🙂"
3409,5.0,"Well this is the place to be when in Seoul , lot is of tourist destination close by, for shoppers it's heaven. Must Exchange your money here cause it gives you the best exchange rates and in Seoul."

Nighttime is definitely the time to come as the lights & people really make it exciting!  Open most nights till 10pm, it's a shopping Mecca!  Must visit if you are in Seoul, just to feel the craziness!"
3412,5.0,"Streets and streets of cheap Korean makeup, fashion, food, and so much more! Could spend a full day here shopping and eating, and you still probably won't see all of it. It's a literal maze! The street food is delicious and cheap! Wouldn't recommend for those claustrophobic and don't like big crowds."
3413,4.0,"So many shops that you just have to be aware of which way you have turned so you don't get lost!  If you are hungry, there are also plenty of restaurants and street food around.  Wear good shoes as you will be walking heaps!"
3414,4.0,"Been there several time, it is a good place for money exchange, and the foreigner friendly show and restaurants. Big chain stores that often occupies whole building floors. But, just way too many people walking on the street and a lot of repeated food vendors."
3415,4.0,"Walking distance from Naemdaemun shopping, this area is full of fun street foods, little trendy skin-care and fashion shops, and lots of trendy, interesting, foreign foods. Personally, I tend to prefer places like Namdaemun and Gwangjang, but for people who LOVE Harajuku and that trendy collegiate-youth-ish vibe, they'll dig this area, too. There's a lot of fun stuff here to check out, so don't be shy."
3416,4.0,"The whole area is filled with street vendors peddling local snacks and shops selling not expensive stuff. Very touristy feel. If you are looking for good fine dining and branded items, this is not the place for you."
3417,5.0,Even if you aren't going to shop (because Seoul is quite pricy) just go walk through the street. Its a great experience and feel. Has all these lovely fresh fruit juice stalls.
3418,5.0,I didn't really do any shopping during my time at myeongdong.. I mostly went to the different stalls at night to get street food. My favorite stall is the tteokbokki at the corner with the guy serving it..
3419,5.0,"This is my wife's favorite place as of now, of course just next to Heaven. All of her beauty needs in just one place. A must go destination for ladies for all their beauty needs."
3420,4.0,This place is literally filled and jammed packed with cosmetic products. Rows after rows of them. As a bloke I found the street food amazing and was stuffing my face while the girls shopped for the latest placental face cream etc... Few restaurants and cafes to stop and have a quick drink/ bite. May get crowded at times but all in good fun right?
3421,5.0,"This is the best place to try south korea's street food. Be there early around 3 pm until 11 pm to experience food trip. Food price ranges from 1,500 Korean won to 15,000 won just for street food. Always share the food with your friend / companion is order to taste a little bit of everything."
3422,4.0,A very big shopping area with many shops in the many lanes. We spent half a day there and got lost in the big area.
3423,4.0,"Busy during the day , but clean and feels safe to wander round. Plenty of street food the day we visited , which was interesting & good to try. Plenty of shops ( a lot of cosmetic ones ) , cafes easy to get there either walking or via the Metro."
3424,4.0,Jees there are a lot of shops there. You can buy many things (be ready.. them pokemons are everywhere). Lot's of street food places too.. Over priced if you ask me.. You can try one or two things but for food Seoul has many much better places. And crowded fur sure. So if you just want to have a relaxing walk this might not be the place for you.
3425,4.0,Was there in the afternoon but the stores are mostly makeup and women's clothing Lots of shops and eating place Went for coffee very late afternoon and on way to subway after coffee wandered bat into shopping district which had exploded into a vibrant assortment of shops vendors and food stands What a welcomed change had dinner at a variety of food stands try as many as you can Go here it is well worth it
3426,4.0,To be honest..nothing really special here..the street food here is actually quite on the high side compare to a meal elswhere..i only came here for a mask shopping which is really cheap depending on the brand you choose..other than that i find item quite pricey here..
3427,4.0,"Korea's best known shopping district, many department stores, shops that sell cosmetics, clothes, shoes and accessories. Also, food paradise too!!! Many restaurant choices.  If you love Korea beauty product, this is definitely the place to do one stop shopping. Because of the competition, you can always snap good deals too!!  Subway Line 2, Euljiro 1-ga Station, Exit 6 Subway Line 4, Myeong-dong Station, Exit 6"
3428,4.0,"This area is a wonderful place to shop for cheap and good stuff especially cosmetic and skin care products, it is also a good place to try their street food"
3429,5.0,"Myeongdong has everything you need in terms of shopping and eating. Thousands of shops, restaurants and kiosks await you there. Since I could not see the sign or the name of the street clearly, and with the crowd walking toward me, I got lost for 4-5 times.  If you find what you want to buy, just buy it because it is difficult to find the way back there again.  If you want to meet someone, consider the subway station or the post office located outside Myeongdong and then walk to Myeongdong together.  Some brands offer you cheap price and it is better to stay there more than 1 hour, depending on your walking and shopping ability."
3430,5.0,Hi there. A must visit place here as you can see there are such a paradise for the girls haha. See you again myeongdong!
3431,3.0,"We met with friends here to spend some time together. After the sun went down, the streets were packed, we did not walk...we were moving in waves as people shoved and pushed. We were packed in like sardines in every corner of MyeongDong. I would recommend visiting during the day unless you enjoy this kind of crowd. There are lots of fun street foods to try and great souvenirs to buy here."
3432,4.0,"Myeongdong is a very popular tourist shopping area in Seoul - if you want to avoid the crowds and the craziness, there are definitely other more remote but great shopping areas (like the bus terminal/subway districts/Insadong/Itaewon/Dongdaemun, etc). Lots of things to do here though so you won't get bored if you do check it out."
3433,5.0,"Lots of cosmetics store, restaurants, etc around the streets. We never gets enough of this place. We always come back here for eating, strolling around, do some shopping when we visit Seoul. We love this place hohohoho"
3434,5.0,"This impressive area is a must-see in Seoul! At first it takes some time to understand the area and market, because it is very very crowded, and with time you get your orientation right. There are many street food vendors with a huge variety of choices - from egg-buns to many different kinds of skewers, from corn to oysters... The price is between 5,000 to 10,000 won per serving, which is quite reasonable - but I have to admit, I could not stop myself from trying almost everything! There is a huge number of cosmetics shops on the street and they are full of people. You can find many kinds of cosmetics from mass brands to quite premium ones. As the street gets more active towards the night, it may be better to walk around Namdaemun Market first, and come to Myeongdong afterwards, because I tried to do the opposite, and all the shops in Namdaemun were closed by 7pm."
3435,5.0,"All about shopping for skin care and make-up. Crowded and not so enjoyable to shop. Some of the sales person are not friendly but not all. It is a nice to shop when it’s less crowded, I guess during weekdays or when it’s very cold. Repeated shops but the deals are slightly different. Many restaurants in this area too."
3436,5.0,"This is the right place to find all kinds of cosmetics...Ladies never leave Seoul without visiting this place. Lots of free samples and very affordable items. also, lots of street food to satisfy your hunger after shopping...a must visit...."

3441,4.0,"We went to Myeongdong on February 2017, the place is full of people, the goods mostly Korean brand but you can find Uniqlo, Zara, Adidas, etc. They have a lot of cosmetics shop, every corner of Myeongdong. Their streetfood stalls are awesome, but lil bit expensive, i think because tourist area. Its hard to find bathroom, i walk into Uniqlo store, and go downstairs twice to find toilet for women."
3442,5.0,"This was my first trip to Myeongdong, and upon arriving, instantly realized why it is such an iconic hot spot for tourists and locals alike. From the outstanding and diverse street food offerings such as grilled lobster tail, Havana sweet corn, to the so-highly-raved Dr. Fish pedicures, Hello Kitty Cafe, coveted skin care stores galore, and even a Cat cafe- where you pay to spend time petting cats while you sip your afternoon milk tea! The staff is pretty helpful throughout the stores you visit. Make sure to visit as many skin care stores as possible, as each one you pass, an associate will try to lure you in by giving you a complimentary face mask for visiting their store (which you get to keep even if you don't purchase anything). I don't speak Korean, so the shopping process wasn't really a hassle, as the associates just informed me whether a product was a cleanser, toner, moisturizer, etc. The shops here have everything from Forever 21 and H&M, to high end stores such as Boy, a London based high-end clothing store with edgy fashions. Myeongdong has something for everyone and is easily accessible by Metro, so make sure you create some time to check it out on your next visit to Seoul!"
3443,5.0,Good places for food and shopping. They have lots of street food stalls at night and also plenty of korean brand cosmetics shops

3446,4.0,I'm 3 shades darker than any of the makeup products for face offered in ALL of myeongdong but nonetheless i had a great time window shopping. The eats around there and the roadside entertainment can keep you busy ALL day!
3447,5.0,"Myeongdong has everything you possibly needs. From over 100 make up counters to boutiques, to a wide range of clothing stores to accessories store. Surrounding the shopping street is street food!! Everything that you see in Korean dramas are all there!"

3450,5.0,All the food is so good and the shopping was super super nice .. myeongdong street is a MUST .. when I went Korea everything was on sale and serious I spent a lot of money cause all the clothes are very nice and comfortable ..
3451,5.0,"1) very nice food to try!! But not all of them are nice..but most of them are so good!! Its expensive than other street food but its worth it if u stay nearby myeondong street.  2) nice vibes to hang out for youngsters at night  3) theres also halal food available  4) clean street.. please throw your rubbish at the food stall where u bought the food and dont litter it on the street. Every stall has their plastic for leftovers and rubbish.  5) there was people wearing red clothes with hat that says information for anyone who needs help with directions so dont worry much if u are lost  6) so much beauty products for u to try with good price and discounts. Skin care and body care, face , foot mask so much cheaper here..!!!  7) reach this place by train and bus."
3452,4.0,"For first timers, Myeongdong is a relatively big shopping street with wide variety of dining options and comestic shops.  Street food in Myeongdong is slightly expensive but tasty."
3453,3.0,"If you like makeup and beauty products this is the place to go. They sell so much of it here. Even if your not a fan, check it out for the atmosphere. At night, street food is also available."
3454,5.0,"A nice walking street market with lots of cloths and cosmetics. Face masks are everywhere and people are buying in bulk.  What caught my interest are food stalls(50-60 in total the day I went there). I recommend grilled lobster with cheese. (15,000 krw)  Catching taxi on the way back to hotel late at night is a bit of a problem because the taxis refuse to use the meter and charge 3x normal rate."
3455,5.0,"Great food selection. Shopping! Shopping! Shopping! Visit the visitor's information center so you won't miss a thing. My niece enjoyed her time at the Dog Cafe. Since you will be seeing the same stores almost every 2 blocks, you might want to plan what to buy in each store so you can get tax refund (30,000 W single receipt purchase). If you don't want to line up for the refund at the airport (took my sister less than 5 minutes to do though), you also might want to ask if they deduct refund right away before you buy.  Some of the food stalls start closing around 11 pm."
3456,4.0,"I have to say it's always interesting to come to Myeongdong. It's always changing. Most visitors are tourists but locals come here too. You can find most of the shops and stores in Myeongdong in other malls or areas in the city. But the experience of shopping outside with street food and merchant vendors make this area an interesting place to come. I recommend coming here at night time with some appetite and roam the alleys and try various foods. Bring cash (Korean won) to make things more easier. You will easily get full trying many types of foods. The food vendors are general clean and nothing crazy or weird food. Also there's many restaurants as well but too many to pick from! Finding a public restroom could be difficult but if you go into large shopping centers or coffee shops, you will be fine. It's family friendly but it gets crowded. I would say myeondong is more for shopping at known brands such as makeups and shoes while dongnaemun is more for local merchants and clothes. There's definitely a different feel. I think you can give yourself about 1-2 hours to go through myeondong streets/alleys."
3457,5.0,"This is a very busy shopping strret ' filled with all the local and other internationa brands but the main attraction is the night market, so many food stands offering such a huge variety of Korean strret food - lots of fun !"
3458,5.0,You can buy pretty much anything here. Gets very busy though as you could expect. Like orchard road Singapore or Oxford Street London.

3465,4.0,"You can literally find almost all well-known cosmetic shops here in Myeongdong. There's like 2-3 branches of the same brand in every different corner of myeongdong. The promoters and workers here speak different languages, especially Chinese and Japanese. There will be a lot of Chinese here as the Chinese Embassy is at one of the streets in Myeongdong (not sure if this was related though.) But anyway, you can find better ""currency exchange shop"" here with better price. I'm not sure about other currency but I know China RMB and Hong Kong dollar have good prices here. So, check it out yourselves :) And, there's lot of good restaurants and of course STREET FOOD."
3466,4.0,"Fun area to walk around in Seoul. Lots of street food and shopping. Visited twice during the week. Would recommend the Nutella crepe, my kids loved it- ""best they've ever had""."

Some shops have their staffs standing outside persuading you to walk in to their shops however be careful I myself experienced being pull in! But there are many shops for everyone to browse."
3470,4.0,This is a typical shopping centre. There are lots of the flagship shops here and multiple versions of the same brand. I got disorientated as to which street I was on. Korea is big on skin care and there appeared to be a third of the shops were skincare. There are also street stalls and street entertainers.
3471,5.0,shopping down town was so clean and safe. You could find so many people speaking English. The people could not do enough for you
3472,4.0,The shopping area is really busy and there is plenty of things to shop and eat. Rather pricey especially for cosmetics but you can get tax free done right inside the shops.
3473,4.0,This is a very lively shopping streets filled with shops selling clothes and cosmetics.  It is a very lively and vibrant area as it is filed with busy shoppers.  The street became extremely busy after 1pm as many of the street food vendors starting selling food too.
3474,5.0,"My wife loved this place. Every shop Vick g away a free sample at the front and so many discounts.  I followed her in only to get the second free sample so she had 2. She bought a lot of stuff, things I don't understand.  This place is Heaven for girls.  There's about 6 of each shop (nature republic, etude house etc)."
3475,5.0,"FOOD The street food stalls are pricier compared to Namdaemun Market or Ewha e.g. egg bread was twice the price in Ewha?  SHOPPING TIPS 1. Don't rush to buy products. Take the time to walk around and compare prices first. For example, Mamonde is a brand under Amore Pacific, and Aritaum is the main store that sells more prominent Amore Pacific brands (so one might think products there will be cheaper). However, while I was there, Olive Young was selling my Mamonde toner at 17 500 won, much cheaper than the 25 000 won at Aritaum.  2. Tax free is a minimum of 30 000 won, so try to collate all your purchases and buy them from the same store so you can hit this minimum. E.g. If you're only going to buy one Laneige lipstick (~23k-25k won), it's easier to get tax free by buying it from an Aritaum store where they carry several other brands you may wish to buy products from (and therefore hit 30k) compared to buying it from the Laneige flagship store.  3. Myeongdong has several outlets of the same brand e.g. lots of Innisfrees, Tony Molys etc. However, NOT ALL OUTLETS GIVE IMMEDIATE TAX REFUNDS. Check if the store gives immediate tax refunds first before buying. This means less hassle since you won't need to dedicate time to claiming tax refunds at the airport.  4. The more you buy from a store, the more freebies you get! So it's better to have one MASSIVE buy at one time from a store than to go back multiple times.  5. The salespeople will tell you that a particular product is very popular. EVERY PRODUCT IS POPULAR IN KOREA. Do your research first, or you may end up spending more than you intend to. (And if you do indeed become an unsuspecting victim, the moneychangers with better rates are those opposite the Chinese embassy in Myeongdong :P)  6. Most outlets will have salespeople pushing their new releases. If you're tempted and are willing to purchase, DON'T GIVE IN/SHOW THAT YOU ARE KEEN TOO EASILY. What I've found is that the harder the salespeople have to work to convince you, the more willing they are to give you freebies. E.g. When I was at The Saem, after 10-15 minutes of extolling the benefits of their Wrinkle Plumper, the saleslady was offering me 2 deep foaming cleansers, a packet of masks and makeup products ""and you only need to buy 2 plumpers!""."
3476,5.0,There are many shops and street food stalls at this street. Come by around 6pm where the street vendors start to cook up their delicacy. The shops at this street are also places to look foward to find branded clothing or beauty products
3477,4.0,"If you love Korean cosmetics, this is where your bliss is. Street after street of korean cosmetic stores are located here interpersed with clothing, shoes, bling, and tourist take-homes. Restaurants also abound in the upper floors of the cosmetic shops. Its pretty crowded but the yummy street food in the evenings are worth braving the crowd. There is a food stall selling japchae almost right at the entrance of Myeongdong at the Lotte side. Its usually the one first to close because its japchae sells out really fast. Look for it and the guy who can make your japchae with our without meat. Mine was purr veggies for 3000 won. 4000 won if with meat. We stayed 3 nights in a hotel right in Myeongdong near the Myeongdong Cathedral and I tasted almost all of the street food carts there. Some are so-so, others were worth one repeat while the japchae was worth going back for 3 straight nights. So 👍👍👌👌"
3478,4.0,"We wanted to go to Myeong Dong Street but not sure how to travel to this place.  We just walked along a subway shopping and exit. Suddenly, we are at Myeong Dong Street. It's somehow so magical.  Food along this street seems expensive. We tried the cabbage omelette, which cost around KW$5000. It does not taste nice.  A very good walk along this street and observe the night activities and scene.  Shops close at about 11pm. Adidas closes at 10pm."
3479,4.0,This is a most popular shopping area in Seoul. You could found all the cosmetic items with 100 sq. Meter. and 2 duty fee shop nearby. But the only problem is too many peoples. It was Crazy!
3480,4.0,"this place is always packed with people, definitely a must visit for shopping from cosmetics, fashion, and also kpop cds (buy it at myeongdong underground shopping mall for cheaper price). there is also lots of street food at night, eventhough it's more pricy compared to street food at other places."
3481,4.0,Well probably the best shopping area in Korea!  Anything that is fashion and cosmetic related this is the place to go by far!  Don't read this go and shop!
3482,5.0,"I used to stay in Myeongdong when i have business trip in Korea, because you can find so many local foods and all fashioned goods here."
3483,5.0,you must visit the cathedral there. a set of quiet and peaceful catholic buidings in a busy district with rich history and culture.
3484,4.0,"This area is a shopping area that is famous for its cosmetic/skin care brand stores, clothing stores, restaurants, and not-to-be-missed street food. The place is crowded most days, but it is one place you will want to experience. Expect to be bumped into a lot by people from all over the world, but dont let it bother you. Where else in Seoul will you be able to say you rubbed shoulders with people from China, Japan, Philippines, Malaysia, England, Russia, Mexico, Canada, the United States, France, Australia, and Africa, all within a matter of minutes. Also be prepared to be pulled into the different skin care stores by enthusiastic sales girls working on commission. Not to worry though, stay here very long and you will leave with a large haul of free skin care samples given to you by these girls. Also, while you're here you might want to consider looking to taking in an afternoon showing of NANTA- The Cooking Show, an entertaining off-broadway style singing, dancing, comedy stage show that is a delight to behold and not hindered by language barriers. Tickets are sold at the NANTA Theater and go quickly, so plan ahead."
3485,4.0,"If you love to make up yourself, there is so many things you can buy here. From top to toe, they're had it all. All the best brand you've ever heard."
3486,5.0,"What is visiting Seoul without a sport of shopping???  If you are traveling to other places in Korea, I'd suggest making Seoul your last stop to save some huge luvvage lugging. Unless its something that is native (i don't know if thts the right word to use, pardon me if it's wrong..!) Or if you happen to be at O'Sulloc Jeju, save all the shopping for Myeongdong!  I swear I thought I'd never see the end if the malls, fashion and cosmetics outlets.. The street is busy so come prepared for it. Comfy shoes and easy to remove apparels are essential if you intend to buy clothes.. You don't wanna be the cause of a dressing room line nw.. There are plenty of street stalls selling really cheap stuff but they tend to be pretty generic after a while and the streets can get a lil confusing after a few turns if you don't read Korean so if you see somethi g you want, buy it! If you've missed it already, dont worry coz it'll likely pop up further down the street! Food options are great here.. We had awesome, awesome grilled beef at one of the upstairs restaurant.. Like literally melts in your mouth kinda meat.. Which we unfortunately finished before we could do the picture snapping thing (yes..it was THAT GOOD..)but it wasn't cheap..like abt sgd$100 for 2 pax w/ additional soup n soju? But it was the best beef we've had the entire trip i swear. If you'd like cheaper options, keep a look out for the restaurants in the alleys..! They serve pretty gd food at reasonable prices.  Once you've eaten your fill, theres always the option of walking those calories off checking out SPAO! We spent like 2hrs in SPAO coz there's soo much to see and try on..if my wallet could speak, it would be crying in pain..  If clothes ain't the right season, go check out Olive and Young. Its kinda like a Korean wonder-drugstore where you see shelves and shelves of products you've never even heard of but can't wait to try..! I got my Dr Jart masks and Whamisa stuff here..!  Sorry guys.. No pictures of the said street coz 1. The fingers were too frozen and 2. Hands were too busy trying stuff.. :D"
3487,4.0,"The entire street is littered with make up shops. From afternoon onwards, vehicles are not allowed. Food stalls sprung up all along the centre of the street. You can get your fill of Korean make up and skin care products and street food. All the shops are trying to outdo each other by giving away free samples, face masks, etc to entice any customers to walk into the shops. It's very lively."
3488,5.0,"All the best shops and always full of life. Big Uniqlo, Zara, Skinfood etc and cafes and street food non stop.  Always fun to walk through and see, smell and taste all the different and often fun decorated snacks from the local cuisine."
3489,5.0,"We had a blast shopping, the place is huge- easy to get lost!!! Lots of good deals, great street food"
3490,4.0,it's like a 24 hour non-stop shopping center but abundant of street food stalls at night some serving lobster tail at $15.00 each. plenty of Korean make up and clothing stores.
3491,5.0,"Head down on a Saturday and go hungry. There are so many street stalls selling so many different dishes and nibbles that you are bound to find something you like. Don't like street food, not a problem there are just as many restaurants vying for your trade that you are just spoilt for chose. I passed by once and then went back a few times."
3492,5.0,a lot of food u can try! not so expensive! they sell clothes also..try bargain as much as u can..very friendly seller.
3493,3.0,"The area is pretty big with lots of shops and places to eat. Quite a lot of western options, which is a big thing for me living in china, but not do much if you are just on holiday. You'll find H&M, forever 21, Lush. And food places like Krispy Kreme, McDonald's etc. I have never seen this many cosmetics shops, ever!! Though the shops and products are all the same and really repetitive. Worth a see but only for an hour or 2."
3494,5.0,"Great place ro spend an evening, people watch, shop and try the variety of street food. Very lively and crowded but a place to experience. Try the ice cream in the fish shapped waffle with honeycomb. Delicious"
3495,4.0,"Great place for shopping and eating. I ate a delicious ox head soup in small restaurant. There are lot of people also. Lot of see, quite cheap food. I recommend to at least visit there once."
3496,5.0,"This place is perfect for those who are into skincare and makeup products. Lots of different brands can be found here, you'll definitely go crazy at the plentiful choices available! Besides that, there are lots of great street food that you can try as well aside from the usual restaurants etc. It gets livelier at night (and more crowded), it's best to experience Myeongdong during the day and night to get a feel f both settings. Definitely a must go to place when you're in Seoul :)"
3497,4.0,i've been there in 21 januari 2017... the things is at night Myeongdong are crowded place.. but its fine you can find many diffrents kind of foods... many restaurants and eat street..ooh and you can find many kind of departement shops too... this place is very enjoyble when you at Myeongdong
3498,2.0,I stayed here for 4 days. Not really for me. I'm a guy and I'm not into shopping. The shops and restaurants here were fairly repetitive. Not many attractions here to see.
3499,5.0,"#1 Place to go for makeup and skincare supplies, shopping, local eats, coffee shops, and more. There is also the famous Myeongdong Cathedral which is worth a visit. Ask the Tourist Helpers in red for a map and directions and they will point you in the right direction whatever you are looking for."
3500,5.0,I went there at least 4 times during my week stay in Seoul. I went at all times of the day and must say that it was the most exciting at night when the street vendors pedalling food and other items for sale emerge. This place is always bustling with activity and there's always something for everyone.
3501,5.0,You can get lots of cosmetic items along this street as there are many stores selling cosmetic items. Lots of street food as well. There are many eateries which can be found along the lanes from the main street.
3502,3.0,"Probably was pampered by how available cosmetics and skin care products are available everywhere in Seoul. Didn't find it worth a trip. There is a Daiso at the end of the street, and the food streets are just okay compared to TW. Prices of merchandise is not attractive compared to what one can buy from Taobao."
3503,4.0,"A street that overload with shopping retails and great street food! I will start to become crowded from 6pm onwards. Selling from the range of branded items to non branded, everything i can find here. I bought very nice puma sneaker at FOLDER, a concept shop with variety of sneakers and sport shoes. and also you can expect to find a lot of cosmetic shops along the street as myeongdong is mainly famous on cosmetic outlets. Street food also delicious! I've tried a few stall and what i can say is, they are selling a really great food! Even during Seollal celebration, this place is open and crowded while other place like namdaemun market and dongdaemun are all closed."
3504,5.0,"Been here a number of times already, but I still did not get bored of this busy street every night. It's a cosmetic and shopping heaven for my partner and the number of delicious street food adds to the fun . However, take note that not everything sold here is cheap, especially for those cart shops, some of the stuff like glove scarfs etc, I have found same one for cheaper price elsewhere.  There is also many good restaurant around here that is mentioned by many food blog, do your research and make sure to visit them!"
3505,4.0,"If you love shopping for Korea brands cosmetics, this is a place you should never skip. Don't worry if you regret not buying stuff from the first brand A shop, there're more brand A shop at Myeongdong. Easily there are at least 3 ""The Face Shop"", ""Innis Free"" etc.  There's quite a variety of street food and cafes if you're a non-shopper. At least a reason to be at Myeongdong."
3506,4.0,"Definitely a street to check out. Lots of cosmetic stores and they tend to repeat after you walk 500m or so.  They have street food starting around 4pm daily, again, they tend to repeat as you go further down the street.  Prices here for food are inflated."
3507,5.0,"We have no itinerary for the day, we just ket on walking and walking until we reach this street Lots of shops, dining area, street foods It's worth a visit."
3508,4.0,You can find all the famed korean street food here. I initially thought that all korean skincare and cosmetic brands would hv at least one shop here but I was mistaken. There are only about 10 brands which had many outlets within one stone's throw. Atmosphere was awesome though and you'd be surprised to find that the cafés here are deserted and practically empty even on weekends. The line friend's cafe is an exception though
3509,5.0,"As expected, a visit to myeongdong doesnt disappoint. Whether you go there for shopping or for food tripping, you will always leave the place satisfied and wanting to come back. The streets are lined with shops filled with cosmetics, clothes, bags, etc. And then there are those food carts that sell everything from potato twists to scallops to lobsters to ice cream at a very reasonable price. Go with an empty stomach to make it worth your while."
3510,5.0,"My fiancé and I accidentally stumbled into this area, not really knowing where we were going. We read about it on TripAdvisor, but just didn't realize where we were when we got there. The street food was absolutely fantastic, streets were so clean, friendly people, LOTS of shops and plenty of dining/ drinking. Great to visit!"
3511,5.0,"It's literally the heaven for make up addict! Tons of free samples. Just by walking around for 2 hours I got lots of samples. And when you buy, you can get more samples! Best thing, when you buy there they can give you discount plus extra product with much cheaper price than its regular price!"
3512,4.0,"If you want to have that korean glow and flawless skin, then this is the place where you can buy those skin care/beauty products. The food here is also a must try. The shoes here are cheaper than those in HK."
3513,3.0,"This is a crowded but pleasant area to shop for clothing, shoes, skincare & beauty products, Korean souvenirs, and more. Remember to look up while you are walking along the streets. There are innumerable shops and vendors to see, and not all are on the street level!"
3514,3.0,"We just went for a short while for the ""been there done that"" factor. We were mostly interested in the street foods which we read so much about. The streets are lined with mostly cosmetic & clothing shops. There are also restaurants around which are mostly long Q because it's a touristy zone. Prices aren't cheap either. You can get similar food elsewhere for cheaper. The street food are quite repetitive in each lane. Grilled seafood sticks, fried chicken pieces, crepes, buns, noodles etc, then repeat. Things aren't cheap. From ₩2000 upwards. And not really wow taste. We tried quite a few stalls and only the fresh strawberry mochi was wow but expensive ₩2500 each. We didn't shop much, just a face cleanser for my brother. There's tax refunds available from some shops for tourists with passports so bring it if you want to shop."
3515,5.0,"Everything you'd want to see, taste or smell is here! I bought sterling silver jewelry in a small and unique shop where the gift-wrapping was too beautiful to open when I got home! Candy hawkers made us laugh with their silly songs and the little restaurant that served bimbimbap opened up a new world of flavors and tastes to us - 2 adventurous Americans who made it through a wonderful day on the street market!"
3516,5.0,"Took my wife here and it was paradise for her. Stores after stores loaded full of cosmetics and more cosmetics. Everything is buy one get one free to lure you inside. If you're a male then prepare to feel lame. It helped that there are food venders all over so at least I had something to do. Should be renamed to ""women only cosmetics street""."
3517,5.0,I believe most people who look up for seoul will ended up going here especially girls this is really heaven for us! If you buying makeup buying together with other friends so you can get more sample and tax refund And dont forget to list what you wanted to buy if not you will get lost here 😂
3518,5.0,An area pack with shops and restaurants. Lots of great Korean restuarants in this area and you can also find many food carts if you would like to try out Korean street food. Many fashion and beauty stores in this area.
3519,5.0,"Complete selection of Korean street food can be found in here. In addition, you can also shop for various kind of goods. But for myself, the street food is the main attraction! My personal favorite is the Jjajangmyeon & Cheese Scallops."
3520,5.0,"Various kind of food in the street at night, good price. My whole family enjoyed a lot there. Deep fried crab was our favourite"
3521,4.0,"Love the vibes. No matter how many times I'd visited this places, I never get bored. It's just like your feet walked automatically to this place whenever you visit Seoul. Lots of stores for us to shop, lots of cafes, street food stalls and restaurants for us to savor, and lots of sudden events to see in this place :) Good place for friends' hangout!  Even while I was writing this review, I miss this place!"
3522,4.0,"If you LOVE shopping, then you can never leave Seoul without visiting Myeongdong. I have been visiting since I was a kid and every time I come here, it has something new! Back in the 90's, it was all locals and I would often come here with my siblings and cousins during our summer breaks. We would always go shopping and eat street food when we got hungry. This was where all the youngsters would go shopping and hang out with their friends. I am surprised by how different it is now compared to the good old days. Years ago, it used to be all the Japanese tourists shopping for cosmetics and the sales representatives were Korean that spoke Japanese. Now, most of the tourists are Chinese and the sale representatives are also Chinese but they are multilingual. (They can speak Mandarin, Japanese and Korean.) If you can speak Mandarin or Japanese, you will be able to communicate with them since they are not fluent in English. A lot of the signs are in Japanese and Chinese so it is easy to navigate around and there are also street guides that can help you if you have questions. The streets are filled with tourists and you'll see the long lines in every cosmetic store. If you go during holiday season, popular cosmetic items are sold out so don't expect to buy everything off your wish list. :( If there's something you REALLY want, try visiting a store that is NOT in Myeongdong. If you get hungry, you will never starve because there are food carts everywhere (only in evenings) and endless restaurants on every corner of the shopping street. Just be careful where you go because most of the places are targeted for tourists so gets expensive and not as good. If you don't like being stomped by tourists, avoid going on holidays and in the evening. I would prefer to visit in the morning so you can shop in peace and not get pushed around by people. Do some power shopping and get out of there around lunch time because that's when it starts to get packed. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes and be ready to do some crazy shopping! :)"
3523,5.0,"I went here a couple of times in mid-January late evenings, when the temperature was below 0. Was pleasantly surprised to see the crowd and energy around. Absolutely loved the vibe. Some shops are pricey but you could find good deals if you explore. Loved the street food too."
3524,4.0,"For first-timers in Seoul, this area is such a fascinating picture of what the city offers. On our first day, we went straight here to experience the street food, and check out the shops.  After a few days exploring Seoul though, we've seen Hongdae, Dongdaemun, and Ewha Shopping street, and we realized just how expensive it is in Myeongdong Shopping Street. The skin care shops and clothes outlets are okay, since they have the same prices across the board. The street food and clothes sold in stalls, however, are expensive. You can get cheaper street food in Hongdae."
3525,3.0,"Various makeup brands, clothing line, and restaurants are located here. Some stores allow additional discounts for foreigners. Street foods are all over the place, just everything starts from KRW3000, though, higher compared to other parts of Seoul like Jongno or Yeongdeungpo (where we also got to try street foods).  If you're up for branded items, this place is good, but if you're not much into it, Namdaemun Market might be a better place to shop, though does not look quite as much modern as Myeongdong."
3526,5.0,"Walked to Myeongdong Shopping Street from the hotel we were staying one day looking for something specific, this place is really unique in its layout, there are maybe a dozen makeup/skin care shops in the area that has multiple stores each around another corner, they sell the exact same things but in case one store runs out of something you can just walk down the street and find another one of the exact same store and chances are they'll have what you are looking for, guess it's a tactic to maximize the store exposure to tourists. Most of the employees there spoke Korean and Chinese, very little English though but since I'm a native Chinese speaker I had no problem getting around. Good little fun place to just hang around."
3527,4.0,This is the place where you can find a lot of street food varieties. Lot of makeup and facial products also can be found here.  However i had a bad experience here with mobile accessories seller. Bargaining is not a option here. They tend to chase you away after you make a payment.
3528,5.0,"An exciting destination at night when the streets are brightly lighted up and the food in the streets so yummy, from authentic vegie omelet to grilled Lobsters! Wow, they have grilled fresh Scallops, shrimps and squid, too even baby octopus...A taste of hogalbi on a stick is krw3000, chicken bbq is also krw3000. Lobsters costs around krw8000..and if you get tired of eating, go inside the Cosmetic shops and try some BB cream (Korea is where BB cream was invented) or CC cream (moisture content). They come in a lot of forms from tube to Cushion style . there you can get some facial masks.. On sale , buy 3 take 1!!..and if you still have extra time, try getting a kimchi lession along Myeondong street. they have a school there that offers Kimchi making!! you will bring home whatever you made."
3529,5.0,"If you love beauty products, you must visit this place! There are restaurants and hotels around the area. The biggest Uniqlo is located in this area. Must visit! Make sure to visit during the day. It's crowded at night...VERY crowded!"
3530,5.0,"Stayed in Myeungdong while in Seoul for the first time and it was excellent! Plenty of stalls for street food to try out. Although it appears cheap at first, having numerous snacks is actually more than a meal inside a restaurant!  Area is typically open from 10 am to 11 pm with nowhere to buy coffee at 7 am and little selection to get snacks after 11 pm!  Shops on the side streets are much cheaper than the ones on the main road. Currency exchange was pretty much wholesale rates, better than the 5% surcharge at the airport for USD cash conversion.  Coffee is excellent in Seoul with pricing about 2x inside Myeungdong whereas half the price a couple blocks over. Quality is excellent either way."
3531,4.0,"A wide variety of street food stalls to choose from, ranging from more expensive items like grilled lobster (10000 KRW for small) and grilled abalone, to affordable items like porridge, noodles, etc.  The place is also filled with make up and skin care shops, it can be dizzying trying to figure out which brand and type to purchase. When I was there, all shops have 50% discount for facial masks (WOW), and according to my friends, some shops do give free samples."
3532,4.0,"Walked there several times during the day and at night. Yes it is very crowded but there are many many streets and alleys to explore. So many shops and eating places to choose from including international brand stores to local Korean. A lot of fun just walking and looking at the shops, the crowds, and trying to work out the foods being sold on the street. Im sure there are other places as well but if staying near City Hall would certainly recommend this as part of the Seoul expereince"
3533,5.0,"A place where you can buy a lot of stuffs especially facial product or make up. Some little tips, some products may be cheaper in the duty free mall but duty free mall is not as complete as this shopping street yet they still have variety of food from breakfast to supper."
3534,4.0,"Visited here on a cold snowy Saturday evening. Great fun atmosphere lots of people, shops open until late, great street food, some items very interesting. Definitely worth a visit. If you are looking for cat cafes as one of our group was this is the place to go."
3535,4.0,"Myeongdong's a great place to go if you wanna shop for makeup and skincare all in one place. It's a nice shopping place but I personally would rather shop someplace else as this area feels so crowded, and I had been grabbed by one of the shopowners in an effort to bring me to one of the makeup shops. Some of the shops also give you free samples so that's cool."
3536,5.0,"A busy evening market, said to go on quite late. Useful mix of street stalls and established international and regional and Korean local shops (H&M, Zara, Giordano, etc). Quite friendly and good for locals and visitors alike."
3537,5.0,"my favorite place in SEOUL , my hotel is located near myeong-dong , so do the math . how many time did I went there just to shop for all my skin care and makeup"
3538,5.0,We stayed at the Lotte Hotel just across the road from one of streets leading into the market. Even after a trip to another location we would find ourselves being drawn into the bright lights and great street food of Myeongdong. The shopping is great for accessories like scarves and bags. Lots of cosmetic shops. We found that there is quite a turnover of stalls and new ones pop up on different nights. If you see something you like buy it because it may not be there tomorrow or you won't find the location again. The food in the market (my best was spiral fries on a stick) is better than most restaurants around the market. You can see what you are buying whereas ordering off a menu can lead to some inedible surprises. Aside from going up to the DMZ this was our second favourite experience.
3539,3.0,We went practically everyday as our hotel was just across the road and would pick up snacks and have dinner at all the restaurants in the alleyways. The food from all the carts are a tourist trap and charge as much as a full meal for a skewer of food. 1/2 a tiny bag of pomegranate juice at 6000W was the biggest ripoff of all. Their prices were inconsistent and I saw that locals were charged half of what tourists were paying. When I confronted the stall owner he just pretended he couldn't understand me. The restaurants in the alleys are much better and you get a full meal out of the same price.
3540,5.0,This is the best place to find all your beauty addiction. Super crowded and a lot of shops you can enter and they also have a lot of promotions. There is also a lot of street foods you can try.
3541,5.0,Myeongdong has a great variety of shops to cater for all levels of budget. Range of prices vary so it is important to shop also in the smaller alleys and boutiques. Quality is good and do make sure you get good quality Made in Korea stuff. Lots of cosmetic shops as what Seoul is famous for. Facial masks and hand lotions are aplenty; take time to shop. Samples available freely. Korean street food is simply great and cheap in Myeongdong! Easy to move around and safe. Make sure you have strong arms ready to lug your shopping items around as there is simply too much to see till the very late hours.
3542,4.0,You can snack on everything from cheese-coated lobster to hand spun sugar strings on an almond. Most of the stores are geared towards younger women and couples.
3543,5.0,My stay in Seoul was really short. I stayed in hotel Solaria at Myeongdong. Only night was available for exploring. Its a nice place enjoy busy Seoul nights with street foods. Muslim travelers can explore the street foods as there are several Halal certified restaurants. For shopping I actually saw lots of beauty products shop.
3544,5.0,"Fantastic food street ! There were treats for everybody from grilled, saucy chicken Bbq (3000 won) to grilled Scallops and Lobsters (8000 k won). You can also find there shrimps and squids on a stick, yummy strawberries at KWon 6,000.00 and the freshly squeezed promegnarade at krw5000. And if you're tired tasting the new and exciting food in the street, you may want to go inside the beauty shops and treat yourself to a Facial Mask from cucumber , Apple, pineapple to Snail and Ginseng facial mask in a pouch. Buy and give a gift to yourself and your friends at home the original BB CREAM now in Cushion. BY THE way, if you are a kimchi lover, enroll in Kimchi making along MYEONDONG and bring home the kimchi you made !"
3545,4.0,Every women's place to visit. it's a shopping area where one can buy souvenirs and a lot of cosmetics.
3546,4.0,A must place to visit for shopping addicts and street food snackers! Lots of skinscare/beauty shops to visit. They even have 3 faceshop stores there! Most shops close at 10pm however street food are open till late. One place I recommend to buy from there and regret not buying more is 'Great King of Castella'.
3547,4.0,"A lot of stores, some of them with really amazing sales (especially cosmetics). You can enjoy the traditional and the modern in this street."
3548,5.0,"This place is amazing! For the shoppers, they have department store settings with flea market prices! For the foodies - WOW! I wished I had multiple stomachs!!! They have Korea, Japanese, Chinese AND around 4pm majority of the street food vendors start setting up! This is one place that you want to do multiple visits. During the day, they also have people in vests to assist you should you get turned around in this maze of stores and restaurants. It's also pretty clean for the amount of people that's there. The only complaint that I have is that there is a LOT of people there that at times I felt too crowded in."
3549,4.0,"It assume all local cosmetics brand such etude house, skinfood, nature republic and including street food at night time."
3550,4.0,"At night the place is visited by many people. Many stores sell goods, especially fashion. We can find good stuff at reasonable prices. Along the way, many people who sell drinks and typical Korean snacks."
3551,4.0,"Crowded and overrated but I'd still choose it over Hongdae any time. The area is huge and it has much more options when it comes to shopping or eating out, also it's possible to find restaurants and bars little bit on the more sophisticated side. I especially like to come here in the mornings when it's almost empty and tourists hasn't flooded the place yet. There are lots of cafes and also cinemas around, it's great to meet up with friends or even your significant other if you're in the mood to spend some time in a lively setting. Come here to exchange money, shop for cosmetics or street food, if that's the sort of thing you're into."
3552,4.0,"This is the good place have all of the thing you can buy, And Loisir hotel is a good location in this area."
3553,5.0,"This is a shopping heaven for girls! There are lanes and lanes of Korean make up stores throughout Myeongdong Shopping District.  We spent lots of time and money here buying all sort of make up and also enjoying the street and restaurant food available.  Typically, you can spend the whole day here considering the amount of shops and food you can find here.  Also, sinc you are gonna burst your wallet here, its good to know that there are plenty of good money changer in this area, trying asking around for the different rates. You can easily get very very good rates."
3554,3.0,"We needed another suitcase, so we came here, we looked, and we bought. Plenty of choices within a relatively small area, and prices were good."
3555,4.0,"There were so much stores and food vendors. Little alley ways with stores and restaurants. Lots and lots of beauty shops like The Face Shop, Nature Republic, Tony Moly, etc... Lots of food vendors which was great! We went during the summer and it was extremely hot! Just wear shorts and a tank top and you're good! During the summer is just way too crowded."
3556,5.0,"If you want korean street snacks, just come here so many type and many shop thay you can buy, this street market only available on night"
3557,4.0,There is plenty of food so don't eat before you go. Stop at all the booths. The prices are different at different booths. Some bartering. Great. Easy to walk around. Easy to get around for young children and older folks.
3558,3.0,Forever21 store has the best collection at this place. Street shopping was little costly compared to other subway shopping in Korea.
3559,5.0,"There are sooo many shopping streets in Korea, but Myeongdong is the mecca of shopping streets.  Such a huge and lively place with heaps of shopping, street foods and restaurants.  We just enjoyed walking around, getting lost, being in on the action, eating along the way and checking out the wares. A must visit at least once when in Seoul.  Myeongdong is also in quite a central location in Seoul, so it's a good hub to wander around the surrounding areas too.  Heaps of fun, especially at night! Beware the cars that drive through!"
3560,5.0,A busy street where you will lose track of the number of streetfood stalls and shops selling the cosmetics and skincare!
3561,4.0,The shopping street is huge but most of the shops are selling similar items. The street food is diverse as compared to dongdaemun and namdaemun.
3562,4.0,"Been here every night since we came as our hotel is quite nearby... street food is amazing, though I wonder why they allow cars to pass by this very busy stretch... great place to just hang out, shop n.eat..."
3563,5.0,"Very lively in the evening, lots of street food and of course the famous Korean cosmetics outlets are all over along the streets. I think you can find almost all brands here"
3564,5.0,"Its easy to go - Myenong-dong subway station. The street is full of Korean cosmetics brand - Face Shop, Etude House, Nature Republic, Innisfree, Tony Moly etc. There are restaurants as well - one stop. You can spend a whole day there. Spend 3 hours and still on the 1st street. The sales staff at the cosmetic shops all speak Mandarin and basic English. Do you homework on what you want to buy before going, unless you have lots of time to spare. Too many shops, too little time. The street are crowded. There is street food after 4 pm. A must go for Ladies! Most Mask are on promotion $10000 won for 20 pcs. Have Fun !"
3565,3.0,"If you love to shop, this area is the place to be! Popular korean cosmetic stores can be found in every block. Duty free shopping malls are also walking distance from this area. Namsan tower is also near this area."
3566,4.0,"A great place to go for shopping for clothes, shoes and other goods. Everything looks exactly the same and prices vary so don't be afraid to comparison shop or haggle :)"
3567,5.0,You'll find this very popular place for Korean cosmetics shop and dining around this area. The sellers are familiar with travelers so very easy to stay here
3568,3.0,"Myeongdong has really changed in the last 10 years or so. It used to be a hip hangout, more focused on eating and secondly on shopping, though the latter was in plentiful supply.  The favourtie foods used to be special noodle (myeongdong kalguksu) - still around and butter squid grilled on hot stones (disappeared).  Today, the district is even more about shopping, less about hanging out and mostly caters to tourists. Good eats are still to be found, but everyhing feels even more commercialised than before."
3569,5.0,"There are more skin care stores per square feet than any other place in a Seoul, maybe the world! All chains, new and old, are represented on the pedestrian streets of Myeongdong. As well well as many eateries. The shop workers speak many languages so communication should be no problem"
3570,4.0,"Beauty sales women are savage. They have free face masks to lure you in. If you don't buy, some will take it back  Good street food. Had a medium lobster tail for 15,000₩ which is a little luxurious. Had fried chicken for 5,000₩  Well known brands obviously. If you want cheaper clothes for similar styles, go to the shops underground."
3571,5.0,"Myeongdong is the most popular place for shopping, but with so many little stalls staying there, it also turns out to be a food street. You will be addicted to different kinds of snacks (rice cakes, sausages, fish cakes, noodles, cakes, cotton candy, or steak, lobsters, scallops...etc.). and, of course you can shop your handbags, phone cases, clothes, accessories...etc."
3572,5.0,My favorite market to visit...a week in Seoul..i came to this place 4 times...interest cafes..beauty shops..learn to make kimchi..hunting Kpop merchandises...try the street-food...still want to go back...
3573,4.0,"Myeongdong is a lot of take in but if you're a seasoned shopper you'll be in your element. The main draw card here are it's expansive selection of Korean Beauty shops - you'll find all the brands here tend to have multiple shops and you often get free samples for going in. Would recommend you go to the official brand shop as you will 100% get authentic products there as well as Olive Young.  There is also lots of young fashion and street brands - I really like A-Land, 8 seconds, the LINE shop and the little boutiques with the $10 t-shirts.  Food wise you will never go hungry! Check out Myeongdong noodle if you want a good hearty lunch, Milky Bee for the infamous rose gelato or all the awesome street food.  One thing to watch are the rather pushy sales people outside the stalls, the worst experience I encountered was one lady who latched on to me and wouldn't let me go. My tip is to be assertive and not feel pressured to buy things you don't want. If you really feel coerced report to one of the tourist police centers or to one of the tourist helpers in red. Personally this was fine for me as I've been to more aggressive markets but I can see how this could be an issue for some people.  Other than that, I highly recommend Myeongdong. I went everyday on my holiday and never ran out of things to do plus there are so many currency exchange places to get more won if you need - wear some walking shoes and be prepared to leave with lots of bags!"

3575,4.0,"If you are looking for great shopping, Myeongdong-dong shopping street is amazing. Value for money and great finds as well."
3576,4.0,"Myeongdong is the mecca where Asian women flock to, to have their dose of make-up purchase. Their selling attributes are duty free, and on top of that, make up companies shower the guests with FREE samples. The moment you thought you have closed the deal by swiping your credit card, the shop owners will tempt you to buy some more with further add-ons such as free delivery to country of your choice. If it's not good enough, what about if they pile you up with more freebies to give to your families and friends back home. Just when you wish to walk away, the owners will give you a wry smile, and then, pile you up with even more free gifts. Talking about killing you softly and gently with kindness, this is as good as it gets. You may find all make up stores here comprise of Chinese speaking sales assistants and all of them originated from North Korea bordering to China. Myeongdong shopping is not something that I have witnessed anywhere else in the world. There's an element of frenziness to it. Just when you think this would be it, there's also Lotte Duty Free stores, Shinsagae Duty Free stores, Doota Duty Free stores, and all of them are featuring stars from your favourite Korean drama. Be wowed and be overwhelmed. It is quite surreal."
3577,5.0,"Myeongdong has lots and lots of shops, food carts, etc. Even if you're not a shopper, it's still cool to window shop and take in the Korean culture. There are so many stores selling beauty masks! You can also get some neat sock designs for cheap at the carts."

3581,5.0,"We took our teenage daughter there with a friend. It was really fun for her to be able to shop in her hometown for the first time. There were lots of places that she loved to shop at and the prices were really good. There was everything from uni-qlo to Forever 21. Would definitely go back,"
3582,5.0,"For those who look for good shopping and great food on the streets. This place is a must to visit! Lots of stores selling beauty products like Innisfree, Olive Young etc and local snack food on the streets eat it while its piping hot. Alot of well known stores as well in this district such as Uniqlo, H&M, their local ABC mart etc where you can buy staffs at cheap prices."

If you come to Seoul and dont visit this shopping street then I can say that your trip is wasted!!! I bought some Beauty Products from the shops here and they are serving me great. Seoul has got some amazing brands and one should try the Face Masks which are quite a trend here."
3584,5.0,"Is really a shopping paradise for those who love Korean fashion and even Korean food. There are tons of shops including clothes, cosmetics and skin care. I would recommend star 101 for those who love a budget clothing. At night, you should try out all the little food store there, cuz they are amazing.  Overall, loved this place xx"
3585,4.0,"It says shopping street but this title is apt only if you are looking for clothes or facial products. The main reason we like this area is the street food...and we even had ice cream in Dec when temperatures are below freezing (well, the ice-cream did not melt). Oh yes, we tried all the other street foods from egg bread to fish pancake to tornado potato. Good place for after dinner snacks."
3586,4.0,"Visited this area on our last day in Korea around 6.30 pm. It was quite a busy area. Lots of shops (individual ones) i.e. Zara, H&M, Adidas, Nike. On top of that, there are food stalls offering local food as well as stalls selling :souvenirs and winter accessories i.e. ear muff, gloves. When I was there, international brands mentioned earlier was on sale, so got lucky to buy things at lower price :-)  In my view it's similar to Ladies Market in Hongkong. Fun to stroll along and shop. *TK"
3587,4.0,"Lots of shops, street vendors and restaurants. Try the 32cm ice cream, egg bun and other street food because they are yummy 😋😋 If you're looking for branded Korean cosmetics, this is the right place. There is a shop that sell merchandises, CD, etc if you like K-Pop or drama."
3588,3.0,This is worth seeing at least once. Only once. It's very cool to walk down but it's very busy and full of foreigners. Prices of things are sometimes higher than a typical Korean area because of the high number of foreigners.
3589,4.0,"We have walked through the main Myeong-dong and several sub-streets nearby, you will be surprised flooded with skincare shops in different brands, mostly Korean like Innisfree, and food hawkers in different types of snacks and eat, fabulous. You will be exited by the types of eat provided, and the speed of service provided by the hawkers. If you want to find restaurant, then you need to search either basement of 2nd floor. The street shops and hawkers close at 23:00, be there at time after dinner."
3590,4.0,It's like Malaysia's Petaling Street. Good place to shop for facial masks etc. But the people can be very rude. People just push and push without consideration for old people. One good thing is South Korea provides information centres almost every where so you wont get lost. Many things to eat.
3591,5.0,"Christmas time in Myeongdong is unreal. The streets are absolutely swarming with shoppers, salespeople and food vendors. The tree lights and lights on the building illuminate the streets as if it were the middle of the day. It truly was an experience. Sales are pretty handy around this time too. Must see in Seoul."
3592,4.0,Myeongdong has come a long way since the first time I visited in 2006. It's now a hyper crazy night market where you can eat and shop to your hearts content.  If crazy throngs of people aren't your thing then I'd definitely stay away.
3593,5.0,I didnt expect that this place was entirely a shopping place! Lovely to see it at night. Bunch of street foods are all over the place! If you want to buy beauty products this place is on top. 👌
3594,5.0,"Heaven for girls, with many skincare brands located here (Laneige, The Face Shop, Etude House, Tony Moly, etc..) Shop till you drop!"
3595,4.0,Many malls and shops in the area so do leave a few hours to explore and shop. A must visit if you are in seoul.
3596,5.0,"+ Lots of food choices + Yummy street foods + Lots of makeup stores + Money changers are everywhere + There are English speaking guides who are always ready to help + You can find the cat and dog cafes here + Malls across the road + Grab a rose ice cream at Milkybee (for your Instagram feed lol) + Visit Style Nanda (Another instagrammable place for girls) + Shopping, shopping, shopping  - Some street foods are pricey like the lobster and oyster with cheese (15,000 won) I can already eat at a buffet restaurant or unlimited Korean BBQ plus soju with that price"
3597,5.0,"If you like Korean cosmetics such as Etude House, Face shop, Aritaum, Moonshot, Skin food, The saem, etc, try to go here as it's one of the most complete cosmetics area and it's good for tourist. Most vendors here can speak korean well, chinese well, little english and little japanese. There's not many clothes and souvenirs here but there's a lot of street snacks at night. The price of the street snacks are a little bit overpriced but if you don't really have other time to go to other place such as hongdae and sinchon, this might be a good place for you to buy foods. There's zara, uniqlo, h&m, forever21, daiso, top10, 8seconds, spao, lotte young (mall), lotte duty free, shinsege department store, myeongdong cathedral, myeongdong theater, nanta theater, Haha's restaurant, Myeongdong Gyoza, Kang hodong's bbq restaurant, hello kitty cafe, cat cafe, dog cafe and many more."
3598,3.0,"Lots of street stalls selling food and many to choose from. Felt the price is quite expensive, eg 4000W for a stick of sausages and 15,000W for half a cheese lobster. Place is very crowded, despite the cold weather and windy condition. Do wear lots of warm clothing. We also discovered there is an underground shopping area connected to the train station. A good place to get back some body warm."
3599,3.0,"Very interesting, street food, lots of people, and if you're a women great shopping! If your a guy you will follow your wife into many stores. What do you do? People watching is very good, many people from many different cultures. Street photographers will love the opportunity!"
3600,5.0,"Myeongdong is one of the must-visit if we come to Seoul. Do not know what drew us to come here every time. There are a variety of cosmetic and street food that can be enjoyed. In Dec this year, I found halal kebab was sell here. There are a variety of designer goods can be found."
3601,5.0,This where we really enjoyed our Korean adventure. Shopping galore and the street food was awesome. I will not forget this experience. 😊👏
3602,4.0,Nice shopping area especially in the evening with good restaurants and good food stalls on the street and good shopping area.
3603,5.0,I went here everyday during our stay. I went crazy with all the cosmetic and other stuff! So affordable! And there's a lot of street foods to choose from here.
3604,5.0,"This is a late review, but I wanted people to know that this place is worth going to. We're a family of 5 adults, and wanted our Dec. 2015 week-long vacation somewhere cold, so we chose Korea. Being our first time, we were not expecting much because we haven't heard much about places in Korea being raved about. I based all my plans on TripAdvisor reviews & as always, it pulled through for me. We just wanted to be near a church to celebrate birthday & anniversary events we were having, so we chose Myeongdong area as our base. Little did we know that our celebration would be so festive, as this Street suddenly comes alive at night! During the day, it looks like a shoppers haven with all the stores lined up along the streets, international branded names like Adidas & Giordano, as well as outstanding Korean brands like SPAO. Lots of beauty products & restaurants everywhere! Most surprising are the food carts rolled out by nightfall and lining the middle of the streets with the most amazing assortment of streetfood I have ever seen! So organized, efficient, clean and very tasty. Even the locals come to enjoy it. It's quite crowded like a night market, but we enjoyed the experience. Colorful lights & music abound, and my young adults were like children hopping from one place to another and can't get enough of all the sights and sounds and food! Perfect place for us to celebrate Christmas season. This area a bit pricey to stay, but book early to get best rates. It's worth it."
3605,4.0,Can't say it is something special but must go through at least once if you visit Seoul. Many different street foods and shops. Got a little taste of the local life and culture.
3606,5.0,Near shopping street and near subway. But hotel room is small and towel is also very small. Will not recommend this hotel.
3607,5.0,"Went there four times during my trip to Korea last week. Lots of restaurant and cosmetic stores! But be careful, street food there isn't that cheap, you can get cheaper food in the market instead. On the other side, restaurant were basically crowded and food was nice! It's better to shop for your cosmetics there because there's always sale there!"
3608,5.0,Wish we have more time as too many things to see and buy. Not everything are cheap but still reasonable compared to other places.
3609,4.0,I have been here twice. Beauty products especially facial masks are on sales. Lots of restaurants and street foods are the best. You can bargain in small shops and enjoy big discount from shopkeepers.
3610,5.0,Great place to shop everything's here and very close to the cathedral church. Most of the shops id not all are on sale. The street foods are also great!!!
3611,5.0,shopping place is here don't go anywhere especially girls all cosmetics heaven and food. From bimbimbap to barbecue it's just tantalizing.
3612,3.0,Myeongdong was a tourist spot and all the stuff there become more expensive than last few year. The people there were no longer friendly and some of the cosmetic shop staffs will run in front of us and show u the free gift and keep asking us to go in the shop. this is really ignoring us.
3613,5.0,"It is a very busy place which is normally open to quite late. There will always be people walking by and salespeople will come up to you to promote especially with freebees. Now remember that there are actually many small streets and corners you can go to and there are a great amount of restaurants, shoe shops, clothes shops, a few kpop stores and especially a lot of beauty stores. A LOT of beauty stores. You will see most of them on the main street however if you happen to be walking in a smaller street there are always smaller versions of the shops. It is best coming at night (when its not freezing cold) as there will be loads of lights and also there will be a lot of street food which you can enjoy. The street food is very delicious and can already fill you up! You might not find many bins so you might have to hold onto your rubbish for a while but through this you will notice that the area is generally quite clean for a place lacking of bins. Overall, coming to this shopping street was a very great experience and is literally next to the train station."
3614,5.0,"I didn't get to see everything this time but MyeongDong is to be the classic hangout in Seoul access to everything & everywhere. Next to all the tall skyscrapes and adjacent to the famous Catholic church of Seoul, Korea. Very ironical but it works & very classic. Whether sad or happy, this was the place to hang out on Saturday for real shopping or just eye-shopping. It was different every week. It's nostalgic place for us Koreans there & Koreans overseas. Now, it's more touristic than every before but still the place to hang out for everyday or for weekend. The Japanese-Korean owned hotel, Royal Hotel Seoul is very Asian looking one that I have seen and very chic. All renovated and very clean right in the middle of MyongDong. Seoul needs some changes or renovations in infra-structure but it'd be on-going economic issue and hope they can renovate with Korean themes intact instead of erasing it."
3615,4.0,"If you are not into beauty products, then don't bother going. The streets have many many beauty product stores. Along one street, there can be a couple of shops baring the same brand. But it's really at a good price. So go for it. We bought quite a bit at Nature Republic, Tony Moly, Innisfree and Skin Food. Felt that the service for Skin Food and Innisfree is the most lukewarm. The staff look good but don't know basic customer service. It's a waste that the staff who stood out in the cold work so hard to welcome customers, and the staff inside the store disgust customers with seemingly judging and unfriendliness.  The street food seems to be of higher priced than the traditional markets like Dongdaemun. Tried the banana crepe with Nutella, grilled prawns and chestnut. They are quite expensive, can eat a meal in some sit down small joints.  It's also near Lotte Malls, went for the super markets. Wonderful place to stock up on the Korean goodies like seaweed, flavoured almond nuts, kimchi, etc."
3616,5.0,"Great place to be. Just take train to Myeongdong and exit by 5,6,7 or 8. A good place to get all your facial stuffs. Note there are several shops selling facial products of same brand in the area. So don't rush and remember to seek the best deal and discount. Of course don't forget to ask for freebies should you spend certain amount.  Do check out the eateries in small street or level 2 of building. They are cheap and good.  Oh yes, bring your passport for immediate tax rebates instead of filing at airport."
3617,5.0,this is a must place to visit! good shopping area and also a place to enjoy seoul night life! You can find shops which carries international brands as well as local brand
3618,4.0,"You can find good deals for korean beauty products and clothes. There's a lot of street food. I cannot say this is not a tourist trap, but as a tourist, I enjoyed it. Even if you don't intend on purchasing anything, you must still visit it."
3619,5.0,"...You will love myeongdong Street! I specifically chose my Hotel for my short stay so that I would be within easy walking distance. I visited day and night - busy and colourful during the day but vibrant, buzzing and lit up with Christmas lights when I visited at night. There was a mix of brand name stores, eateries...and every brand of Korean cosmetic!  The Street is lined with fast food stalls - I loved the prawns. English wasn't really spoken but I had no problems communicating with a combination of gestures and smiling!  I was on my own but felt totally safe, even at night. Take the usual precautions and you should be absolutely fine!"
3620,4.0,"This is a very ""hip"" place. Lots of shopping filled with street food stalls. Basically, you can eat at the stalls and shop and repeat again. If you are tired, you can park yourself at various cafe around the area."
3621,5.0,"Streets are lined with lots of korean cosmetic shops and restaurants. When sun starts to set, food carts line up in the middle of these shopping streets. Bought a lot of sweet strawberries from the food carts, tried some of their street food as well. Simply love the joyous feel of the street."
3622,3.0,"Myeongdong is like a shopping haven, if you don't mind the crowd.  I personally don't fancy crowds so it was abit of a disppointment. There's people walking aggressively and spitting almost everywhere. I find it disgusting.  But the place itself is cool. The vibe is different from other shopping streets. And I LOVE the street foods!  If you have not been here, do visit. If you have and didn't like it, like me, skip it. (:"
3623,3.0,Cool to see but it was mostly junk with a ton of people walking around. We did eat a fried donut that was awesome from a vendor.
3624,4.0,"Lots of street food and vendors line the streets and you get to savour local delicacies while browsing through polo shirts, scarfs and bags etc. The buildings fringing the streets also teem with restaurants offering lots of BBQ, ginseng chicken and other mouth watering fare that will whet your appetite. Enjoy a leisurely stroll and soak up the night market atmosphere you will not forget."

3626,4.0,Nice Christmas decorations during December and there's a lot of shops selling cosmetics and clothes around. Street food was okay but definitely much more expensive than elsewhere (about 5000 won).
3627,4.0,"Affordable Korean food along the street!.. Cute and cheap socks made in Korea is must to buy here.. 11 pairs of socks for 10,000 Won. Tips to not get lost here: Decide one place as a spot to meet and make sure to take a picture. Save this picture in you mobile phone. When you get lost, find people with red hat and red vest who walk around the street, then show to them the picture you taken. They will guide you to find the place."
3628,4.0,"many stores are selling homogenous products, therefore can accumulate and buy at one store to take advantage of bulk discounts and tax rebates"
3629,5.0,"I has so much fun exploring this area. My hotel was very close so I get to experience Myeongdong in the early morning until night. A variety of street food from savory to sweet are available at night so you can take a break from cosmetic-shopping and sample Seoul's delicacies. And don't let me start talking about my loot!!!! I got different kind of sheet masks, ampoules, essense, creams, night mask and what have you. I literally filled my luggage with make up and beauty products. I will definitely come back."
3630,5.0,"Lots of bright lights here, shopping and street food. So fun to walk up and down these small streets...try some squid on a stick, some lobster with cheese or any one of the other dozens of street food on offer."
3631,3.0,There are more tourists than locals. Every street and alley looks like the other. If you get lost pay attention to the stores. Street food gets repetitive. Stores get repetitive. It was not exciting. Good for cheapest mainstream cosmetic products.  Very overwhelmed. And no desire to visit again.
3632,5.0,"If you are doing shopping in Seoul, Myeongdong Shopping Street provides you one of the competitive price. As it is a tourists attraction, I believe the items will be marked up in price. But this is not the case. Thus do not need to run all over Seoul to find the cheapest bag, socks etc. It is all here at Myeongdong Shopping Street"
3633,5.0,"You can find all the Korean famous cosmetics brands, casual clothing brands and famous food joints Also close to Seoul Cathedral and Lotte Dutyfree It's fun and you will want to come here when you are in Seoul"

3637,4.0,"After a good dinner at Amiso (3F Poraris Bldg., 53-1, Myeong-dong 2-ga, Jung-gu), wandered Myeongdong on a Friday night. What a hoot; stalls lined both sides of the main shopping street selling all kinds of food, mostly on skewers, from lobster to fried cheese, as people milled and meandered from kiosk to kiosk, sampling this or that. Stores were open late and the cosmetics/skin care stores (there are many) were crowded. Temperatures were low, so need to bundle up in Dec., but a fun place to people watch."
3638,3.0,The shopping street comes to live in the evening.  There are so many shops selling cosmetic and stuff for ladies. If you want to impress your wife or partner this is the place to be.  There are also street food stalls selling almost the same things. If you are not keen there are also many restaurant.  A good place to visit in the evening.
3639,5.0,"Great place to shop and according to my daughter the best place to shop she has found. Prices very cheap, quality very good and the area is clean and safe. Also if you have hassles there are information persons who speak a variety of languages to help."

3641,5.0,"We visited this street almost everyday, even at different time of the day, it is really busy. A lot of happening here. The LINE cafe/shop is a long q to take picture with its character (bear). Kid will have never ending wanting of stationary and stuff. Mainly there is plenty of walking, seeing and buying here. There are plenty of food outlet here, new release of retail stuff will be here. It is a street where vehicle can also move around, so keep kids close. Overall worth visiting, plan for a whole day here."
3642,3.0,I visited this place at night. All the store is cosmetic and the price quite different with same store at different location. The food stall in here so expensive. The different price around 500-1000 won.
3643,5.0,"Whichever one prefers, it's a recommended stop. Big stores, small stores of all variety. Lots of eating places of any style. After 5, the street food venders come out serving anything from lobster tail, grilled abalone, octopus, bake goods, skewers,etc...... Reachable by subway. Attended a famous theatre show there called "" NANDA "" very entertaining and recommended."
3644,4.0,Best place to get korean skincare and makeup products. Promoters would hand out free samples (usually masks or facial cotton packs) to lure potential shoppers. There are a couple of cat cafes & dig cafes too and the largest uniqlo store.
3645,5.0,"Myeongdong shopping district is a delightful, modern, upscale shopping district that offers high-end shopping to low-end bargain stores where one can find a broad array of merchandise, food and entertainment to some degree, although this is not an entertainment district per se. One can find great bargains and inexpensive good food, or one can spend high-end and choose more upscale dining. Hotels are integrated in the shopping district, too. There also are cobblestone streets and churches to visit. The shopping district often has street entertainers that enhances one's experience as they work themselves through the district. It is a large geographic area. The Myeongdong shopping experience is an experience you will remember and take home with you."

When night comes, the street is filled with mobile traders and serving tasty street food and many handy merchandise. Lotte shopping centre are just nearby and if you like the proper and branded stuffs, do drop by."
3648,5.0,"Great market stalls however some prices aren't cheap. There are however large wholesale shops so if you're buying in bulk definitely recommend going into them. In th street markets I wanted to purchase some key ring fluffy rabbits, cost in the market was $14,000 (won) for 1 and $3,000 (won) each but I did need to buy at least 7, which is what I needed anyway, so saved so much money. Most of the items in the wholesalers are out in the street markets so go save some money in their - heaps of jewellery too but most places you'll need to buy 10+ items. Loved all the different types of food stalls - from the amazing huge ice cream for just $2,000 won, huge smashing balls, giant meatballs plus another dish which I'm not sure on the name but it's like a small sweet pancake for $1,000 - definitely wish I had more of these, one just wasn't enough!"
3649,5.0,"If you are in Seoul you cannot miss this place!!! It was designated as UNESCO street in 2010 for a reason!  Delicious street food, shops, bars, market - all that razzle-dazzle plus Christmas lights! We loved it!!!"
3650,5.0,"Street food is overpriced and not that good. Except for the Strawberries it costs around 7000 to 10000 krw. It's very sweet and fresh. It's Cheaper if you buy the one sold in a cup for just 3000 to 5000 krw. Shop in artbox if you like cute and unique stuff. Holika Holika, etude, innisfree, the face shop is almost in every corner. After shopping go to Myeongdong Kyoja. Hands down serve they serve the best dumpling!"
3651,5.0,shopping and great street food. It is recommended for everyone who is visiting Seoul. Good access to the train . Lot of american and European as well.
3652,5.0,"go there not to buy, but to observe young generation. great atmosphere, don't hesitate to try food street, always spicy and great share with friends"
3653,4.0,"A popular spot for tourist and also a personal go-to for me whenever I visit Seoul. Has a broad range of cosmetic brands such as innisfree, Laniege, faceshop etc. Remember to bring your passport for instant tax refund over the counter (for selected brands).  Street food are delicious and usually starts to open around evening, although on weekends they are mostly up at noon. There are other restaurants too deeper inside."
3654,4.0,"Similar to shopping areas in China and Singapore, the streets are lined with exotic food on carts, and its so crowded that its hard not to bump into other people. The area is famous for good quality cosmetics. Bought lots of stuff from Nature Republic."
3655,5.0,"This is exactly what I expected street shopping in Korea to be like! The shops, vendors and food stalls were amazing. You are surrounded by the sights and smells of Korea! Have the mondu!"
3656,5.0,"One of my favorite places in Seoul! Enjoyed eating street food, shopping for small trinkets and just walking around trying out new things. Will always drop by this street whenever I will return to Seoul. I cannot wait to go back. Food is clean and hygienic ( for those that I tried eating)"
3657,4.0,Be sure to spot the guides and get a map! Rows and rows of similar brands shops will make one giddy and lost! Get free samples by just visiting the shop even if it is window shopping! There are loads of street food come evening time but they are overpriced for the tourists so save your money and eat elsewhere.
3658,2.0,"Why am say so as above subject? Cox 90 percent of the shop we went have promoters from main land China. It's good idea to have them becox of China tourist a lot nowadays however the customer service need to be polish a lot. Rude, disrespectful and very pushie which have no chance for customer to walk around the shop see another options. Understand this is the communication way between them (China & China) but as in service industry especially in tourist sport like Myeondong the promoters have to treat others Chinese not from China in another way. Because Singapore, Malaysia and others Chinese are not been communicated this way which for us this way of communication is very rude. Because of this， the whole Myeondong can't see much on Korean type of culture. Great Xmas déco and foods a around. So keep it up. Will visit Myeondong again but try not to engage with those rude promoters."
3659,5.0,"I would only visit at night as the street is lined with vendors, mostly of food, which makes it fascinating and fun. It is a place to be in Seoul at night--so the streets will be crowded. The shops are mainly for cosmetics and skin care items which are so different than what we have in the USA. But there are also some other types of shops and many places to eat. Just a fun place to be in the evening. Go!! Seems to stay open until about 11 or 1130 PM."
3660,5.0,"Paradise for shoppers 😉 so many fantastic goods ... clothes,shoes,woman apparel,make up kits,electronics and many... It's makes me crazy to bring all the items... Myeongdong is a great place for shopping ... 😊👍👍👍"
3661,4.0,We visited myeongdong twice as we find that this is one of the best shopping district in Seoul. Lots of nice street food and beauty products. It's also located just opposite Lotte shopping center. There were nice restaurants in the area too. Only thing is that there isn't rubbish bin around. We later learnt that you can actually asked the stall which you buy the food from to throw the rubbish into their own bin. Will definitely visit Myeongdong again when we visit Seoul.
3662,5.0,"Must, must, must shop, eat, and shop and eat. For me I had prawns on a skewer from the Shrimp King, 10 pairs of socks for the kids for a $1 each, Banana and Nutella crepe and I think you get the idea!!! Enjoy it all!!! I"
3663,5.0,"This is just like Causeway Bay in Hong Kong with all the shops you can imagine in one area. Ladies' paradise with skin care shops taking over 50% of the retail space, rest for fashion, food and massage salons. One can literally stay here the whole day.  More, the street food is so good comparable to those night markets in Taiwan."
3664,3.0,"This place somewhat requires a little bit of being physically fit. So many places to shop around, so my piece of advice would be to specify the list of what you are gonna buy, and get to the places of that specific interest. Otherwise one will be terribly tired after so much walking from place to place )))"
3665,5.0,"Myeongdong is bustling with tourists and some locals all throughout the day and into the night; it has a great atmosphere, numerous stores (clothing and shoes are pretty good value) and fantastic street food. The food stalls are quite clean and many of the options cannot be found outside of Korea and are definitely worth a try."
3666,5.0,"A trip to Seoul is incomplete without a visit to Myeongdong. Ladies will go wild once unleash upon Myeongdong. I saw with my own eyes, ladies of different ages, lighting up when we got there. Ladies' products aka cosmetics of brands alien to most guys can be found here. This place is worth your time if shopping is on your list. You can see people walking in light, coming out with baggage on wheels courtesy of the merchants for buying just too much. I guess the price is more than right. Happy shopping here."
3667,4.0,"Place is crowded as always with interesting items on sale. There are lots of food and merchandise, with plenty of shoppes and shopping to do - clothes, bags, socks, souveniers, belts, toys, etc. Sellers are nice and cheerful."
3668,4.0,"For the male, they basically find a nice cafe place to sit down and drink coffee. But shopping paradise for females. Plenty of cosmetic shops, fashion outlets."
3669,5.0,"Am never into street food but this experience was completely different. The area is very clean, orderly and well kept so I believe the food is safe to eat.  Enjoyed a variety but my favorite was the the pancake in the shape of a fish with red bean paste."
3670,5.0,"Every kind of shopping you can imagine. High end, low end and in the middle. Plenty of cosmetics and street food."
3671,4.0,"This is a large shopping area, mostly focused on cosmetic products. There are bigger stores like Nike, Adidas, and H&M, but many smaller stores for just cosmetic products. I found it odd that many of the cosmetic stores had multiple stores in the area - Innisfree, Skinfood, Toly Moly - all have multiple stores, selling the same products, spread out so it feels none are more than a block away from each other. The streets are packed and sometimes cars seem to slowly move through the crowds, since they streets aren't officially closed off for most of the area. At night, there is a lot of street food available, which is always great. During the day, most of the vendors are not present but there are still a few street food stalls open. It gets really packed at night. The area has a lot of restaurants as well and many different cafes that you can duck into to get away from the crowds. This is a great shopping destination for those interested in cosmetic products, but at night is worth a visit to anyone looking for street food."
3672,4.0,"In the three-month summer holiday vacation, I travelled to Seoul, which is the capital of Korea. Korea is a country that includes a lot of culture, arts and music. Once you mentioned Seoul, you must think of Myeongdong---which is a famous tourist attraction that gathers all sorts of delicious food, fashion shops and cosmetic brands. As we all know, cosmetic industry is very famous and vital all over the world. People are also keen on the products. So you can find a lot of cosmetic brands whatever you need. Sometimes there are too many choices that enables you dazzling. Like Etude House, innisfree, clio and so on. I like here cuz the price here are much cheaper than I buy in China. It is really very substantial. It is a shopping paradise. I advise that the people who want to go to Myeongdong need to make a shopping list in advance in order to buy all the things you want."
3673,3.0,"Nice shopping street with numerous shops selling clothing, shoes, beauty shops..etc. basically all shops sells almost the same stuffs"

3675,5.0,"This is truly the place for the shopkaholic. As an Asian girl, I did have lots of joy going around this area. All the shops are so nice with kind and cute staffs. The street food is a bit expensive though :D"
3676,5.0,"I spent 2 days at this place to shop for cosmetics. It is a place where ladies could go crazy and maybe missing in this area. There is also alot of street food too. I purposely spare my tummy space to have my ""dinner"" there. I would suggest you to do the same too."
3677,3.0,"It is definitely worth checking out Myengdong if you are interested in buying local Korean brad cosmetics. You have to do your homework on what you want to get because there are really TOO many options to choose from and you need to shop with a list. Most of the stores repeat several times so don't worry if you haven't gotten something, most likely you will see the same brand store several more times in the area. While there, check out the Lotte Department store, they have Duty Free shopping on floors 8-9. One very used tip is that Google maps doesn't work in Korea so don't rely on finding a route using it."
3678,3.0,"Reminiscent of Shinjuku in Tokyo & Causeway Bay in HK.  Lots & lots of shops (many repetitive!) but give me Ewha University any time. And if you are too cold to walk above ground, go underground shopping !!  Lots & Lots of street food but give me Namdaemun any time."
3679,3.0,"If you are into shopping, then this area is for you. Personally i avoid going here unless i have specific item that is cheap here. The area is way too crowded with mainland chinese tourists which for me ruins the whole shopping experience. Several big malls in the area and streetfood is also available. Skip this area if you are not into shopping."
3680,4.0,It is a nice place to shop in Seoul as you find a lot of stuff here. But you have to bargain a bit for the best deal.
3681,4.0,"We need two days to try all their local street food. There are speciality cafes like cat cafe and dog cafe etc.  There are many cosmetics & skin product store where many Chinese speaking sales will patiently explain each product in detail. Remember to request for on the spot tourist tax refund in cash and also free gifts. You can also request for a free luggage with min spending.  Finally, wear comfortable walking shoes."
3682,5.0,"If you are from the states ull understand why it reminds me of vegas. They have people on the streets giving u ""free"" stuff if you go into the stores. There are like 3 or 4 of the same stores on one block. But i still went in everyone of them. Lol. They have good deals but bring your wallet because ive found the fountain of youth but its gonna cost u. Lol. They say korean skincare is the best so i threw all my money away for the best lotions n creams with gold flecks in them. Lol not only does it have good shopping but ooh it has good food everywhere. We stayed in chungmuro and walked here everyday for food. Mmm, still dreaming about that andong jimdak. Which is a must try!! Ladies go check it out n bring ur mans wallet."
3683,5.0,"This street and the area is great for shopping fashion and cosmetics. It is a bit repetitive though, which is a shame. Many of the brands have a multitude of shops with exactly the same products.  It does get very crowded and loud. The people stand outside their shops and shout at you in a variety of languages to try to get you to come inside their shop. Can be a bit tiring.  When evening comes the food trolleys are everywhere and you can find lots of different tasty street food. There are also plenty of restaurants in the area."
3684,5.0,"SoKor cosmetics shops left and right. If you missed to drop by one shop, worry not coz for sure you'll see the same store the next corner. No shortage of street food at night. Tip: Look for the steak kiosk near Zara.. you can get your steak for 6,000won."
3685,4.0,"Great atmosphere after 4pm when the traders set up. So many shops, restaurants etc. Everything from high end to low and everything in between. Great fun. Lots of walking but easily done. Pleanty of good street food."
3686,4.0,"visited the place in early november 2016  i cant remember the countless times that i pulled out my wallet in Myeongdong.. there are lots of kpop related items, facial products, high end streetwear (MCM), food, etc.. i literally spent my entire day here. i swear there must be some magic going on in Myeongdong on attracting all the shoppers.. ^ ^""  i even had to change extra currency while shopping the area and I cant rem the exact location of the moneychanger as it was my first time and Myeongdong is literally a maze to explore! But it was dubbed as the best place to convert your home currency to korean won, e.g. elsewhere was 1 SGD = 816 won, whereas this place gave 820 won."
3687,5.0,"Easily access by bus from gangnam, just 2 bus. Many stores selling local brand, i need a day to walk around this shopping streets. There is crowded castella store, i dont like it very much but i dont know ehy people like it very much"

3689,4.0,The first snow for 2016 came yesterday amidst the candlelight demonstration for their President to step down. It was cold and walking in the open was challenging for people loke us used to near equator weather. As usual the street is basking with street stores selling from food to drinks to all kind of accessories.  It is cosmetics galore from a wide range of brands attracting all the ladies from everywhere.  One of the must visit place when in Seoul.
3690,4.0,Good and not very good.. a nice plave to everyone but some things are so much expensive than the other places like dongdaemon and namdaemon

3692,4.0,"The street extends for a long walk having shops on both sides with a taste for everyone. Brands, Korean brands, counterfeit products and local hand made products are all available with a wide variety of prices to serve everyone. Beware of counterfeits and strangers walking you into back shops. Restaurants from around the world so you won't have a problem with food, you might even end up eating your favorite hometown food."

3695,5.0,"An all-in-one shopping paradise. Almost everything a tourist shopper could ever want can be found here: street food, cosmetics, clothes, shoes etc. I could visit again and again and not get tired of Myeongdong!  As this is a prime shopping area, it will be crowded. Avoid weekend nights if possible."
3696,4.0,"Lots of local street food and shopping. Street food is only available in the afternoon and there are may selection.  If you want local food in the restaurant, please go to small alleyway instead of the main street as it is cheaper. Most restaurants have English menu."

3701,4.0,"Myeongdong is super touristy, eve in the day with all the skicare and fashion shops - not the cheapest and definitely lots of repetition. Once the food stalls come out, it's a smorgasbord of omnomnom-ing your way down steamed egg buns, cheesy grilled scallops and refreshing pressed pomegranate juice, to name a few. Generally cheaper in Dongdaemum and other less hyped up areas."
3702,4.0,"Easy access and good for last minute shopping! Lots of good street food too! Tried out Hotteok and Odeng on a cold and breezy evening last week and instantly felt warmer. Try visiting in the afternoon if you want a less crowded area.  Tip! Do explore the other alleys when you go cosmetics shopping. Sometimes they have the biggest sales, promos and free samples. Once we were dragged at Holika Holika by their staff (we didn't intend to go inside), but we found the greatest deal in our vacation inside that store. 50 pieces of Facial Mask worth 20,000 won. We went to the other Holika, Holika store on another day, but they only have the 20 masks for 20,000 won promo."
3703,4.0,"I thought if I went to Korea again, i will go there Myeongdong shopping Street.There are many different kinds of shop in there also there are some food stalls and the food was very delicious. I thought if people like to make up,they may be crazy because there are many shop that sold make up product also the clerks can speak Chinese that can help you to find the product that you want, there are many discount in this Street, we spent two days and bought many things. If you feel tired, you can just find a shop to eat water ice or drink a cup of drink, that water ice was very delicious.The Shopping Street was too big even though we spent two days, we still can not go everywhere in the Street, I think if you like shopping that you may be crazy and happy in the Myeongdong shopping Street."

3708,5.0,"This is close to Myeongdong subway station and is a must with teens for their snapchat. Mine had to go to get snapped indulging in the famous 2 foot tall soft ice cream cone in different flavours. You can pick vanilla, chocolate or green tea. Lots of restaurants and shops there too. Great for a sunny afternoon out,"
3709,4.0,"Definitely a great shopping area in Seoul. The streets themselves are lined with many different stores- mostly beauty product or skin care stores. The streets themselves are also blocked off from automobile traffic, so the sidewalks are cluttered with more vendors and street food. There are also sit-down restaurants, if that is more your style (it is mine!)  The street vendors mostly sold shirts, purses, and so many socks. Once you think you've seen it all, go underground to a subway entrance (or even just an underground mall) and see even more shops! What surprised me was the abundance of the same brand within the shopping center.  I'd say that dusk to night is a more exciting time to visit. The streets are very crowded, and there are many noises and lights to keep you occupied. Myeongdong is worth it to check out, even if you aren't planning on purchasing anything."
3710,4.0,"If you love food, should come to here ! A lot of good street food can get from here ! Nearby also have shopping Malls. for shopping, please be careful when shopping.

And even on a weekday night late at night, there are plenty of people around so that you can enjoy the hustle and bustle.  However, I feel the main attraction here was the street food. Unlike Gwangjang market which serves the same few dishes of street food (dumplings, rice cakes, etc.), this market serves a large variety of street food which makes it a little more interesting than Gwangjang. The vendors are quite clean and there are many, many options ranging from Western inspired options to Korean. Definitely a must try when you get there."
3715,2.0,"I have been to Myeongdong many times while living in Korea and as much as you will find a lot of things there; you must be willing to deal with a ton of people, as well as flashing lights everywhere and people shouting things in Korean; Chinese and Japanese."

Korean food, branded and imitation products, toys, everything under the sun. A bit pricey to be honest, even the most simplest of stuff. At night it transforms into night market so more food, more variety."
3730,5.0,A must visit shopping district in Seoul. If you can't find it here you most likely don't need it. Extremely busy on weekends and weekdays aren't much better but it will be well worth the shoulder to shoulder foot traffic to experience this place.

3741,4.0,I've never seen so many cosmetic shops in one area. There must be at least 100 if not more in Myeongdong. They sell cosmetics made in Korea. Have you noticed how beautiful the Korean skin is? I think their cosmetics must be fabulous to produce such beautiful skin.  Most of the shops let you try them out before purchasing. I went to one of the less expensive shops called Orchid. The lady put whitening cream on one of my hands 5 days ago and that hand still looks whiter than the other. I wish I would have purchased the product.  There are other stores in this area and a very big department store at the end of the street. I think it's a LOTTE store. Also the stores you see now in every major city.  On the day I was there two guides were helping people and gave out maps of the stores. They also answer questions of where you can find things.  Street food is available too. It's fun to people watch. There are a few benches near the cross intersection of the 2 main streets. No cars in this area makes it easy to walk around.

It has tons of skincare shops, large Lotte and Shingasae Departmental stores anchor the streets among with many great restaurants, coffee houses and tea houses. It is full of street food vendors too. It is brightly lit, bustling with people till at at least 10:30pm. A couple of bars open till later. Highly recommend this area. If you can only visit 2 markets in Seoul and also buy things, this will be one of them."
3770,5.0,"An overwhelming experience. Great shopping area but the plethora of make up, coffee and cake shops is a first in my travels. Great vibe and experience and one can spend hours and hours wandering around people watching albeit most are there to shop, shop and shop."
3771,4.0,"A lot of shops selling trendy clothes and shoes, as well as masks. Many of them speak fluent mandarin and offer discount if you buy a lot. Street food is little bit expensive though."

3775,5.0,Makeup Check! Skincare Check! Clothing Check! Shoes Check! Accessories Check! Food Check! Myeongdong is the shopper's dream destination. You can never miss a skincare/makeup shop there's one every few stores and when you're tired from shopping you can eat or take a break at a cafe. The only thing you may regret is using all your money too quickly
3776,5.0,"Vibrant area that has lots of shopping boutiques. Most stores are Korean cosmetic shops but there are some shoes and apparel shops like H&M, Adidas, Zara as well. Street market starts at night. There are street food as well. Most shops stay open till 11pm."
3777,3.0,"A lot of similar brands along the streets - as it's really crowded and make sure you have a check list with you on your purchase. Some shops might have a slightly better deal and for some products, you may get it at a better price at the underground walkaway of Myeongdong Station. It's great as there are many things to shop and eat however the promoters particularly at the beauty / wellness stores are much ruder (i guess they must have been too frustrated as they faced a lot of people daily).  Do look out for those push carts along the streets as well - fashionable and affordable clothes  P/S: most of them can converse good mandarin"
3778,4.0,"If u are a shopper, this is a must go place. The food sold are like those in Taiwan nite markets and along the streets are all the fashion retail, cosmetics, restaurants, etc... very crowded place and across the road via a underground shopping mall is high class malls, eg Lotte and Lotte Young, pretty expensive but very upmarket, fashionable and unique in designs. For the underground mall, u can give it a miss. So the food street retail shops are more reasonable in pricing. If u are a shopping fanatic, give yourself at least one full day."
3779,4.0,This district is a real heaven for cosmetics lovers! So many skincare and make up to buy from! The shop attendants can be a little pushy sometimes and they follow you in every step. Shopping for clothes is much more expensive than Europe example: Zara clothes were much more expensive than my country.
3780,5.0,Bustling shopping district with thousands of cafe and skincare and fashionable clothing. Streets food is great. Must try the fish waffles with ice cream. Halal food available.
3781,3.0,"Myeongdong is a good place to shop and at the same time eat street foods!!! If you dont like to eat while roaming around shopping, you can go ahead and find a restaurant that you want since myeondong is also full of restaurants.  However this place really gets crowded in the afternoon till late, like too crowded wherein its so hard to walk or take pictures. Just be careful of your belongings while walking in the busy crowded streets of myeongdong.  Getting there you can take the subway, line 4 exit 6. Or other exits if you prefer.  I enjoyed eating their street foods! Really specially the tofu kind of cheese !!"

3785,3.0,"This street is good I guess if you want to buy cheap Korean beauty products. Many Chinese tourists with suitcases shopping here. I don't think that it is a tourist attraction, just for shopping if you are interested with those products. Would not recommend..."
3786,4.0,Very busy shopping street worth a stroll but didn't find it the most exciting range of stores. Mostly repeat of the same Korean cosmetic stores again and again. But lots of independent stalls out of the front of stores selling all sorts of things and lots of yummy food stalls! Very crowded on weekends. Close walking distance to to Namsangol Hanok Village and Numdaemun Markets which are both worth a visit.
3787,5.0,"So much to see, so much to do, so much to buy haha. Ton of people, good mix of Korean and western shops."
3788,4.0,"We went on a weeknight. It was really busy. Even if you don't want to shop you should go there for the atmosphere and to check it off on the bucket list. There were a lot of duplicate shops. There is also an underground shopping Centre at the Myeongdong subway. If you have time check it out, the stuff there are pretty cheap Women's clothing starting at 10,000 won. A lot of trinkets. To note the socks DO make great souvenirs. There's a stall above ground selling for 11 pairs for 10,000. Average price per sock is 1,000.they have different characters. Fun and cute."

3792,4.0,"This is a place where you can really feel the atmosphere where there are so many street food, shopping and cosmetic shops. The street food is really good. However, how many of them are authentic Korean food? But it is still delicious. Very competitive and aggressive selling especially the cosmetic shops."
3793,5.0,"Luckily we were staying in the Myeongdong area and this was just outside of our hotel. There's a lot of food vendors, beauty and souvenir shops. One day is not enough! The food vendors start setting up at about 4PM, but the shops open in the morning. It's pretty much the same beauty shops, so if you missed one shop and wanted to check it out again, you'll definitely see the same shop around the corner. You'll be surprised how much time you can spend in one skinny, long, and what seems like a never-ending alley. Definitely check it out!"
3794,4.0,"Great place for shopping in Korea especially with friends. There are a lot cheap street food so no need to worry about being hungry. The people at stores are nice but if you are a tourist, they may lie about the price or exaggerating their information. So be careful! Overall things tend to be cheap for buying except luxury stores."
3795,3.0,"I found myself very confused by this area. There must have been at least 4 of each store. I guess just to fill up the area and make it seem bigger than it actually is? It was neat, but there wasn't anything particularly special about it. If you're looking for shoes or natural beauty products, this would be the place to come."
3796,5.0,Nice commercial area to experience Seoul's pop culture. Good for buying clothes and make up. One of the must-go spots in the city of you are interested in shopping.

3799,5.0,"I read in a review a guy said three hours of shopping and all he walked away with was empty pockets and a happy wife! Well it's true lots of women's clothing and makeup, nothing my size or colour. But my wife had the time of her life. So totally worth it. Happy Wife Happy Life!

3804,4.0,"Meyongdong is the main shopping district in Seoul.As soon as you get out of the subway station you are right in the middle of it.It is one main street connected by a number of side streets. The main street is full of cosmetic shops and street vendors. Most of the street vendors come out in the afternoon and stays on until late in the night. Weekends are very crowded. Do not forget to look up when you are walking down the street, there are a number of good restaurants on this street.With in the block in Lotte's main store and Shinssgae department store is only a block away.My suggestion is to visit in the afternoon or at night 7-10 p.m. to get a good idea of what is going on.At the entrance to the main street and near the subway exit is an optical shop with some good frames at very reasonable price.They claim that they can do your prescription lenses(normal prescriptions only) in 1/2 and hour."
3805,5.0,This is a definite must do! There is a subway very close by as well as city buses that run. We love the street food and enjoyed the people watching and shopping. It can be very crowded and cars drive on some of the streets where people walk so be careful.

3807,4.0,"Travelling isn't complete without a day spent at shopping (as per my girlfriend).  Myeongdong should be experienced at least once during a visit to Seoul. I didn't really buy much besides streetfood and some places to eat Bing-soo, but it's really interesting to experience the massive crowds, pushy sales tactics and overall feel of what the young people in Seoul are up to these days.  It's easily accessible by metro."
3808,4.0,"This is my second visit to Seoul. This time I purposely book accommodation in Myeongdong because for me, this is the best place to stay for tourist. In this shopping street, there is a lot of brand store which you usually found in shopping mall around the world. Cosmetics shop here is like a shopping paradise for woman. There is a lot of cosmetic shop and their offerings is different. Choose as you like. There is also a lot of hawker in the area and you can enjoy variety of Korean street food. For muslim, you can refer to a lot of articles online on which foor you can eat. As for restaurant, there is also a lot of restaurants you can try. In my opinion, Myeongdong shopping street is the best place to go shopping and hang out after a long day visiting the city."

3810,5.0,"We stumbled onto this area by accident! My son and I aren't big consumers, but we are big on experiences! So we just walked. At night. The bright lights and tons of little shops was almost over stimulating! We did keep trying the street food. Good Grief, it was AMAZING! I loved looking in all of the windows of the stores. I loved turning down the corners only to discover more stores and more street vendors. I didn't mind the overcrowded chaos! I don't have to live in the middle of this. Why they allow cars to drive down some of those crowded streets is beyond me.  Personally, I'd be worried to take small children. If not tied to you, they could easily get lost. But teenagers would love it! It was a tremendous amount of eye-candy everywhere! You can literally shop 'til you drop!"
3811,5.0,"We stayed at a hotel in the heart of Myeongdong and was not disappointed! Just a few steps outside of the hotel was food street lined with food carts in the late afternoons to late evenings. The area is teeming with restaurants and shops that sell everything from clothes (Zara, Uniqlo to name a few), to electronics (Apple) to a bewildering array of beauty products (Leaders, innisfree, to name a few). Believe me, it's the place to be if you want to be in the heart of the action in Seoul."
3812,4.0,Was raining when we reached the Myeongdong shopping street. Jammed packed with loads of tourists and many buying cosmetics products. My wife went there for the purpose of buying cosmetics which is quite cheap comparing getting in Singapore but what was lacking is the services. Some of them are not even attentive in serving you and their eyes will be roving around which kind of pissed my wife off.
3813,4.0,I find the area to be popular with tourists looking for bargains. Street vendors were very friendly and the place appears to be very tidy and well organised. Plenty of items to look for and buy for self as well family members.

3817,5.0,"Myeongdong is a must visit for tourists even if you aren't a shopper at heart, you can still enjoy the street food and just experience the madness! Make sure to visit Sulbing (upstairs above one of the 10 Nature Republic stores) and enjoy the Hello Kitty Cafe.

3834,4.0,"Not that good for native citizens. I'ts Korea but almost seems like somewhere in China 'cause of signage and tourists.  But if you like street foods, you could find various things in here. It's could be called as street food EXPO."
3835,5.0,"A lot of fun, day or night. The street food was delicious and it was busy enough to feel a buzz without being overcrowded.

It is one main street with multiple side streets, all full of shops and restaurants. Much to see but it must be noted that there are some stores with multiple branches in this area.

I like this place for many cosmetic shops and ability to use not only Korean and English languages, but also Chinese. People are friendly and ready to help or give you an advice. It is also easy to exchange money or use your bank card. + Myeongong is close to Namsan Tower and the city center."
3871,3.0,"I'm not much of a cosmestics enthusiast, which is the main reason I found Myeongdong a tad underwhelming.  There are plenty of cosmestic shops, but after a while you realize there's another outlet of the same chain 4 stores down, and another and another.  Of course, there weren't only cosmestics. Clothing, shoes, souveniers, etc were all available too."
3872,5.0,This shopping street is crowded with both tourists and local people who seek for nice shopping place. The whole shopping area may cover around 4 sq.km. and you can waste all your day end up shopping here. There are also 4-5 shopping mall around the shopping main street. You may face Korean street somehow if you have luck and it is very nice experience.
3873,4.0,This area (more than just this street) is full of higher and high end shops. It was nice but I just didn't love it. I was not buying anything so maybe that makes a difference. Plus I think its better at night.

It was so fun to choose what to eat and walking along the street and craving anything I see! Plus you can find so many Korean cosmetic shops which are all on sales! It made me crazy for shopping though...:) Good place to visit with your friends!"
3877,5.0,"When in Seoul, Myeongdong Shopping Market is something that you cannot missed. From simple korean street food to Kpop souvenirs and fashion can be found. The Korean brand cosmetics with very helpful sales staff are always there to assist when needed. I spent almost 3 day just roaming the streets and of course shopping therapy..... definitely a place to recommend."
3878,4.0,"This place has got a vibe. Shoppers' heaven and also offers various food along the street for food lovers. Literally you can shop til you drop, but you can grab whatever you like on the way. It seems that it is almost always crowded til late."
3879,4.0,"As expected, it was a mecca of beauty shops, some designer brands, with a sprinkling of a few department stores (Lotte and Shinsegae),a music store and coffee shops. I enjoyed shopping here to my heart's content. The atmosphere has an energetic vibe especially at night when the street is filled with young couples and those who want to spend some time with their friends after school or work (20's-30's)  Myeongdong shopping street is a 2-3 minute walk from Pacific hotel which was very near where we were staying. It was December when we visited and at night, there were a few carts selling delicious street food so we practically lined up behind the locals and enjoyed piping hot food."
3880,5.0,"My husband and I had so much fun experiencing the Myeongdong Shopping Street, which we stumbled upon after leaving dinner on our first night heading back to our hotel (we stayed at the Lotte Hotel Seoul). The first night, we simply walked through and saw all the amazing good and ended up getting fried ice cream even though we were stuffed from dinner. We ate dinner here one night and everything was delicious. It was hard to decide what to try because everything looked so good. Definitely experience this street, even if it's just to look! There are many shops and stores in this area too!"
3881,4.0,"Myeongdong is like Shinsaibashi and Dotonburi in Osaka, but it mix together in 1 street (area), not like in Osaka which separated by a river (2 street).  Lively, urban soul, lot of stores (local and international brand), restaurant and my favourites, FOOD STALL.  Sausages, deep fried crab, grilled shrimp, grilled octopus, ice cream, dessert and many more.  Like my advice for Dotonbori, it's better you spend 1 day to try all the type of food stall, while enjoying this dynamic street.  They will give you different sensation than just eating at the restaurant.  Direction to this attraction : use subway and stop at Myeongdong station (exit 6).  Instagram : @adjimantoro"
3882,5.0,"I very much liked the atmosphere and the vibe. Amazed by wonderful food stalls, many halal items (e.g. corn, egg bun (the one without pork), fried bananas, pomengranat juice, potatos, lobster tail, ice creams with honey..etc). Fantastic place - not to be missed! Enjoy :)"

3884,4.0,"This location have a lot of restaurant, shop and street food. I like street food at Myeondong street. Have a many clothes for select. Moreover, have hotel and guest house that near with street. So comfortable transportation when I shopping to late at night and easy to walk to back at hotel."
3885,4.0,"High concentration of Korean skincare, make up stores and sports shoes than clothes. Word of advice is to ensure you have some orientation as you will see the same brand appearing here and there and after shopping for awhile you might lose your way.  At night time, all the street foods are out and there is a good selection but as we were already been stuffing ourselves with proper meals, there was no room for more snacks.  Shopping hours roughly from 10 or 11am to 10.30pm ish but best to check the store first."
3886,4.0,They have all brand of korea comestic in this place. The product are cheap especially when there is a promotion. This place have many local street food but quite pricy compare to their local market. But its worth to try. You can walk whole day in this area if you have enough money~ The disadvantage is this place have too many people.
3887,5.0,"Place where you can find both locals and tourists. Amazing shopping street with many (most of them budget) brands. An especially good place to explore the Korean beauty brands, like Tony Moly, The Face Shop, Laneige, Skinfood, Etude House etc, which are considered some of the best in the world (and not expensive at all). The area is full of life and young people with amazing street food. Worth a visit!"
3888,5.0,"This place is the best for beauty products & street food. All the beauty product store you can imagine its all here. Its hard to resist not to go in and buy something. Street food starts at 2pm, come here on empty stomach and try all the food. Came here 3x in the evening and we always come out with full stomach and a smile in our face."
3889,4.0,Overall the shopping was excellent and there were a huge selection of food stalls to choose from. However due to the being the main shopping area for tourists it was very crowded and hard to move around at times.
3890,5.0,Here is the place for shopping and eating. This place is crowded. We went there at 10am and it was already crowded. Many cosmetics stores. There is also daiso. Many delicious local snacks and interested restaurant. You can also find line store in here.
3891,4.0,"I love this part of Seoul! There are lots of shops and food places too, having you walking for hours and not notice the time. The fact we got free wifi on the streets was the highlight! The Shinsegae department store is awesome especially the directory and their restrooms. The under ground mall had many store keepers that were pushing us to buy clothes that we could get much cheaper in the US, which is closer to us. But that had free wifi too! There is one shop near one of the entrances that sold clothes at reasonable prices! All the western products were too expensive here!"
3892,3.0,"Myeongdong probability is the number one go-to place for international visitors with lots of shops, restaurants, and theater. but the place was packed with travelers at all time."
3893,4.0,"I spent of couple of hours exploring the Myeongdong shopping district. There are a startling number of cosmetics stores - who knew that Korean ladies buy so many cosmetics?! Cosmetics aside, there's some interesting things to see, and there are many choices of places to eat. You must try an ice cream from Milky Bee! Most of the signage is in Korean which can make it difficult to fully see what's what if you don't read Korean. It's busy and buzzing and well worth a look. I spent about 2 hours there in all."
3894,5.0,"If you are looking for a shopping and streetfood haven...this is it. From beauty products to clothes to yummy delicous korean streetfood, you'll spend hours walking and never even notice. Every square inch is filled with stores and people. Queues form on the most exceptional stores or restaurants. Definitely worth a visit if you're looking to shop and dine."
3895,4.0,"You can find almos all stuff in this area. Popular korean cosmetic brand, Korean traditional stuff and traditional street food and much more"
3896,5.0,"If you're all about make up and skin care, be prepared to splurge. Great finds and really cheap compared to UAE prices. Ask for freebies. Food stalls and restaurant are easy to find, long lines for the good ones. But some store closes early as 2100. An hour or two is not enough in this place."
3897,4.0,"Too many cosmetic shops! They have a lot of offers The sales persons standing in front of their shop promoting their products. If you are cosmetic fan, pls come here.  You will see famous brand like nature republic, the face shop, skinfood having more than 2 stores in the same street."
3898,5.0,"This place is so fun. Best place for socks in Korea, which sounds weird but Korea has hilarious and interesting socks and you definitely will want to pick up a few pairs while you are here. There is also a great food market here which is amazing to see. The only thing about Myeongdong is you have to have TONS of time to search and always bargin! I believe the Korean term for 'give me a deal' is 'gacka juseyo!' which they find hilarious. I lived here 2014-2015 teaching English and made sure to bring my family here when they visited. Wear comfortable shoes and bring lots of cash!"
3899,2.0,"My wife was attracted by great discount items outside one of the cosmetic shops. The shopkeeper asked us to go inside for more discount items, and that was a mistake, because my wife was persuaded to buy more expensive items, and we couldn't get receipts because the shopkeeper claim :"" you are getting many freebies"". After we bought our things, I found out that the items are slightly more expensive than Lotte duty free store even with ""freebies"", I shold have bought them at Lotte Duty Free Store because I would get discount with coupons I got from airport.  To keep it simple, if you are tourists, visit Lotte Duty Free Store first before you go to the ina street to buy cosmetics, At least you take down the price at Lotte DFS for comparison."
3900,5.0,There is nothing that you can not find in this market. Your family will love it. It has many cosmetics shops.
3901,5.0,"We have visited few times to Myeongdong. Each time we have gained different experiences. We could say it has progressed even to the street food...the varieties have been increased to different levels...like the rose gelato, ice-cream on the fish-shaped cone, grilled abalone, grilled shrimps... The new shopping malls and hotels create a new whole shopping experiences. It is a must go place in Seoul!"
3902,4.0,"It was quite a pity though, I went on a rainy day and moods for shopping were just ruined :( So do check your weather forecast before heading out to Myeongdong! As the streets do not have shelter at all and it was so tiring to keep on opening and closing our umbrellas while visiting various shops. I believe almost all Korean Skincare/Beauty brands can be found in Myeongdong, from Skinfood, Banila Co, The Face Shop, Missha, Innisfree and many many more. Some shops even have duplicates in different alleys of Myeongdong! Theres also Aritaum(their Sephora in Korea) and Olive Young(their Watsons/Guardian in korea) 2 levels of it - which you can find Neogen, Son&Park and many types of 'smaller' korean brands haha. Clothing I did not really see, other than in the shopping malls which were H&M, Zara and other international brands which are a tad bit more expensive in Korea."
3903,5.0,"My friends certainly raved about the great cosmetics shopping adventure they had in Myeongdong Shopping Street, and the fact that they can use their debit cards issued by Philippine banks. Such convenience won't go unnoticed by travelers, who does not bring so much won with them, or who have ran out of won and had to look for money changers.  As for me, I had a delightful gastronomic adventure in this shopping mecca. We didn't go to any special restaurants or cafes to fill our bellies; we just went looking for the food kiosks that sell street food we have not tried before. If you're adventurous enough in what you're eating, I recommend for you to try the (1) soft and moist egg muffin, (2) fish cake on stick with a little paper cup of soup to go with it to keep you warm, and (3) Hoddeok, which is like a pan cake that has sweet filling inside and fried crispy on the outside served to you in a paper cup.  Even if it's filled with Koreans and tourists, there's room for everyone in Myeongdong, and people are very friendly and accommodating. I'm waiting to go back to Korea and to Myeongdong again :) Who know, it's going to be soon!"
3904,5.0,"Of the 4 days my family and I spent at Seoul, we spent 2 evenings and an afternoon at Myeongdong Shopping District. It is at evening when not only is it cooler but also where the whole place becomes vibrant with the street (makeshift) vendors plying their trade and where the place becomes expectantly crowded.  Shopping experience: This is a shoppers’ paradise for mainly mid-price items – Korean beauty products, ie cosmetics, skincare, facial masks (Innisfree, Laneige etc), bags, clothing, shoes, socks, accessories, spectacles, music etc . There are several huge department stores (e.g. Uniqlo, H&M, Lotte).  Dining/Food experience: Again, this is a diners’ paradise. There are countless eateries and restaurants. For dinner, we ate omelette rice, pork cutlet rice and noodles at a Korean restaurant (it’s got a phrase “名人since 1976”). Myeongdong is home to numerous shops serving wonderful desserts – we ate green tea ice cream and green tea roll cake at O Sulloc Teahouse (next to McDonalds). We also ate the fabulous Strawberry Sherbert with daifuku (mochi filled with sweet red bean) and Injeolmi Toast at the popular Korean Dessert Café Sulbing. Sulbing (translated as “snow ice”) is similar to the traditional Korean dessert bingsu, but instead of using ice, frozen milk is used as the shaving block, which gives the dessert an incredible smooth and fluffy texture as well as a rich, creamy and sweet flavour. From the evening street vendors, you have to try the 32cm ice cream (in green tea vanilla, chocolate vanilla, strawberry yogurt etc. flavours) in a cone (2000 won) or in a cup (3000 won) and the egg bread (“gyeran- ppang” in Korean) which is a popular street snack in South Korea.  Cultural experience: Besides the shopping and dining experiences, not many foreign tourists know about the free rental of the traditional Korean costume (hanbok) and photography experience at the Seoul Global Cultural Centre located on the 5th Floor of the M-Plaza. You have to reserve your slot for the same day. While we were there, this hanbok experience was only available from Monday to Thursday. This is because it’s substituted with ‘Descendants of the Sun’ military uniform experience from Friday to Sunday.  So don’t miss Myeongdong’s shopping, dining and cultural experiences when you are in Seoul! And I recommend you stay in a hotel that’s within walking distance so that you don’t have to carry those shopping bags for too long (We stayed at Holiday Inn Express Seoul Euljiro which is within 15 minutes’ walk to Myeongdong)."
3905,4.0,"Looking for local delicacies or just everyday foods; walk down the many streets in the Myeondong. The food stalls are neatly placed and organised and the food is fresh and delicious. Locals are always happy to see a tourist taste their foods, makes the experience even more fun. Enjoy!"

3910,4.0,"Extremely busy place whether day or night filled with places to shop and to eat. All the popular brands of clothing, skincare, makeup, drugstore from korea are place together for your convenience. Due to the high density of tourists in the area, everyone in the shop can assist you in english, chinese and etc. but be warned its so full of tourists im not sure if this place is ""Korean"" anymore."

3917,5.0,"Myeongdong is probably the biggest shopping district I have ever seen! So many streets lined with cosmetic and fashion stores, we went during the summer sales so every store had discounted products. The shop assistants are very friendly and helpful with explaining what each product is for, but they can be quite pushy. The street food vendors come out at about 4:30pm and the shops are open until about 9 or 10pm. We spent hours here and I still feel like I could go back and see/shop some more!"
3918,3.0,"One of the best places in Seoul for shopping, shops at every turn, with many restaurant options. Check around for different prices at the shops as they may vary"
3919,5.0,"It’s where Asian tourists go for their made-in-Korea beauty products supply. All the known stores are here, every other corner, bustling till almost midnight in summer. The sales people only persuade passersby. If you have something in mind, well you can get it here, free samples included. BB, CC, DD creams anyone? I think price wise, they cost as much as what you may get online, plus the postage. Perhaps the supplies are “fresh”. There are stalls selling food (grilled octopus, pancakes etc.), drinks (fresh fruit), socks (animated), clothings etc. I have been here at different periods - in March, June, August, September and October - it’s more lively during the summer, more stalls too. Plus, you may stop by any one of the cafes (many) here for a Bingsoo, but not in October. There is an Artbox store around the corner too, if you get tired of the beauty products and would like some “unusual” gifts for yourself or someone else – browse is the word."

There is a stall here selling the tallest ice cream cone I have ever seen. Taste of the ice cream - well, so-so. Many cosmetic shops touting for customers. A good place for the youngsters.

I like the ""food hawker"" selling bbq squids, sweet paste coated fresh strawberries, the famous 32cm long ice cream on a cone. I was told that an average of 1,000,000 person passes through the street of Myeongdong. Not a place for young children or parents with prams.

3962,4.0,"Fun shopping area, this area was my favorite. Had the best night market too for food. However, the food vendors all closed very early since they're just stalls in the street and this wasn't a ""food market""."
3963,5.0,We stayed in the area so it was convenient to pop by every day. Lots of street food at night - although i did not particularly find it very good (Taiwan and Bangkok are better); lots of dining options - the Myeongdong Gyoza eatery lives up to its reputation; love the shopping there - dizzying array of beauty products.
3964,5.0,"I love hereeee!! We stayed in Myeongdong so that we can shop anytime!!! Also, all of Korean street food is here!! If you are into Korean beauty products, oh man, you will probably spent all your money here!!!!! We went during the Seoul Summer Sale 2016!! So everything is in sale up to 50-70%!!"
3965,4.0,"You will not go hungry here as you will be spoilt for choice with the wide array of Korean food, desserts, restaurants and street food! There's hair salons too but personally I feel that it's at cut throat prices."
3966,5.0,"Bunch of comestic, clothes, foods store, walking there and feel the spirit of korean. I actually love the way they can't speak English and you must work every way to get they understand you for barging or buying something."
3967,4.0,Haven for shopaholics with all types of budget. There are many malls and underground wholesale markets. Note that these don't usually open until the evening around 8pm.
3968,5.0,"You'll never feel bored if you come here for shopping and sample some of the yummiest street snacks. It differs every season.This time I went to Seoul at the end of Spring. Strawberries are abundance, grilled seafood, flaky pastry called taiyaki filled with sweet potato or cream cheese, honey butter corn are some of the favourites."
3969,4.0,Too crowded as it's the most famous tourist shopping area. You can find all Korean and international brands (medium level) plus on the weekend the famous Korean street food. I suggest to visit in the morning (they normally open the shops between 10 and 10.30).
3970,3.0,"Have beem living in Korea for over 5 years, and I must say that each year 명동 becomes less and less enjoyable.  It is sooo crowded, and with a seemingly never ending influx of tourists it doesn't look like that will end anytime soon.  My advice is you can find all of the same stores at almost any major subway stop in Seoul, and you can shop much more comfortably."
3971,5.0,"Shopping at its best. I love this shopping street, all the latest fashion, trendy, cool and hip styles line the shops of these streets. Hundreds of Korean make up and skin care brands to choose from. Late in the afternoon, kiosks of food stalls line the middle of the shopping streets for a taste of Korean snacks."
3972,5.0,"When we went out for our first time touring the city, this was highly recommended. The walking areas, the people,and shopping are second to none. We had a great time."
3973,5.0,"Best place to go shopping in Seoul. We were after some Korean beauty products and found some great offers, don't hesitate to haggle to get freebies."
3974,5.0,"Once you arrive there, you might be so suprized at so many people walking along the street filled with so many street venders and shops! But it's really exciting to walk around there, finding, tasting and shopping there! Street food was really good and our tour guide let us know good restaurants,too! It turns out so great! For food, shopping and real korean modern culture, I recommend to look around this alley! highly!!!!!!!!"
3975,5.0,"You are spoilt by having so many different types of shopping in Myeongdong. Besides clothing, shoes, make-up shops , department stores etc there are also the interesting stalls of freshly cooked food in the middle of the closed streets. It is a shoppers and foodies paradise."
3976,5.0,"I'm in love with this street , you can go and have ice-cream , sandwich , smoothie and more as a snack , also you ganna enjoy shopping for things that made in Korea."
3977,5.0,"I think no one will miss to visit this famous shopping area in Seoul. You can find numerous shops and restaurant here. If you are do crazy shopping in clothings and cosmetics, this is definitely a place you need to go. Also, you can find lots of restaurants selling traditional Korea food. In conclusion, an area to spend whole day long!"
3978,5.0,Just went there for the street food (twice) 😃 Korean food that tastes amazing! Very busy and there are a lot of shops around.
3979,5.0,"It is so much fun to walk around. The streets are crowded. It has its own unique style. Cosmetic shops everywhere, food carts everywhere and it's delicious. Just go there and enjoy yourself."
3980,4.0,"Stopped by on several occasions to sample the food and never left dissatisfied. While it can be quite crowded, it is well worth the visit. You can find some incredible snacks, full sit down restaurants, and small shops and street vendors. If you go, you must try the grilled snail, it's excellent."
3981,5.0,This is much a district than a shopping street. Full of Korean cosmetics stores and you can try some street food there. it is very crowded at night but in a good way
3982,3.0,if you look for all related to make up and beauty.. this is the place that can satisfy you.. It's a girl place with lot's of Korean make up brand.. They also have a night snacks market in the center of the walking path and you can find some interesting food. Good but not too good..
3983,5.0,Went there at night and full of buzz with street food vendors and shopping along with the small outlets and restaurants. Loved the atmosphere!
3984,5.0,Just go and enjoy. Taste the different food they offer. Cheap and delicious. Buy some body lotions or tea or just hung arround.
3985,4.0,"If you are looking for Korean cosmetics, this the place. But it is a popular spot all day and evening with restaurants and other stores."
3986,4.0,"It was pretty fun to just walk around the neighborhood. There is a lot to see, a lot of shops, cafes and street food wagons. They serve a diverse variety of food and its absoluteli delicious. Just 2 things we bought for a quick snack."
3987,4.0,"It is just like what the title above said. There are street vendors selling delicious food and drinks. There are also cosmetic, clothes, shoes shops left and right beside the streets. Overall, it is a great place to go for shopping since it literally has everything there. If you want a perfect picture of how the place feels like, it is like Taipei's Ximending. P.S. Didn't have time to take picture since there were so many people around, and I was quite busy carrying shopping bags on one hand, and food on the other."
3988,3.0,We had some street food there which was good but I think you could get some less expensive food at the underground shopping malls or in subways.
3989,4.0,ok - its a shopping area but to be honest it came alive for me at night when all the street food traders came out. There was such a huge choice it was hard to resist!! The usual European and American brands are here but try and find the beauty shops as beauty in Seoul is HUGE and some home grown brands that are great e.g. Nature Republic stores.
3990,5.0,A few decent shops but overall a bit pricey for goods. Great place to get a feel for modern Korea. And for Korean watching. See the latest fashions and hear KPop being played in the street from shops. Many restaurants and cafes. Eclectic. Vendors with mid street carts are fun to peruse and often have the best bargains on accessories and trinkets.
3991,5.0,Love love the place if you are a shopaholic like me. The street food is to die for. Never give this a miss!
3992,5.0,"I love Korea and I love the buzz and atmosphere in Myeongdong. All alive & fun. As expected in Korea. You can literally find anything here, from food, cheap shopping, skincare, accessories, and etc.  Travelled July 2015"
3993,4.0,"Are u ready for Shopping?? if yes, please set your time as least 2 days for shopping at Myeongdong Shopping Street, this place is so many cosmetics shop, cloths & shoes."
3994,3.0,Myongdong street is the most crowded people area in Seoul for shopping and food kiosko experience.  I visited with my family after years and I recommend night visit for best flavour of amazing shopping and street food experience
3995,5.0,"Great shopping area. It's like shopping in 5th avenue or Paris, in other words expensive!! You can window shop, not for budget tourist."
3996,5.0,Best street to shop and eat in all Seoul. Tons of street shops for food and souvenirs. Restaurants and lotion stores everywhere. Nights light up the street with more markets and food (specially on weekends). Do not miss it!
3997,3.0,"Depending on what time of day you go there and also what weekday you may encounter normally crowded streets to very very busy streets. Before the shops are people trying to get you to come inside the shops and give you masks as a treat, especially on the weekend. Honestly nothing bothered me there and I knew the place was good to get CDs for a good price. It is after all a shopping street and as such one should see it. The shop assistants are good with English, Japanese, Korean and Chinese. Was a fun place to stroll around and just explore."
3998,5.0,A place for tourists to shop. It mainly specialises in Beauty products but they also cater to fashion. It ranges from cheap to luxury goods (no to much on luxury for road side stalls) and has nearby malls like lotte plaza and lotte young. Also offers a variety of food and is accessible to lots of tourist spots.
3999,5.0,"Of all the areas I went to in Seoul, Myeongdong was ourabsolute favorite. The streets were just lined with so many shops and good restaurants."
4000,4.0,This was the place for the younger members in our group. Spend a good number of hours and could see the place change as night near.
4001,4.0,"Great place to soak in the shopaholic scene in Seoul, with innumerable stores for range of products from international vs korean house. The vibrant place with street food options is a must do especially if one is looking for great deals on local cosmetic brands"
4002,5.0,"Myeongdong is a heaven for girls. There are a lot of cosmetic shops such as Etude House, Banilla, Aritaum, Clio and more. Around 4pm, street food vendors will start their business at there."
4003,3.0,Ming Dong Guesthouse's envoirnment is quite good. We reserve twin bed and the bed is large and it is very comfortable.
4004,5.0,"Like seriously any Korean cosmetic brand you could think of is here. Saw 5 of the same brand littered about the stretch. The staff barely spoke English but were very eager to help. Requesting for tax free when you forget and come back later is like asking for an arm and a leg. So basically gotta remember that anything above 40,000₩ entitles you to tax free which you HAVE TO ASK FOR. And don't forget to bring your passport because trust me; you'll go mad here and you'll definitely be entitled to tax after. Prices in Singapore are fluctuated to 200% so trust me I'm not exaggerating on the level of madness. Men, just drop your women here and pick them up after the stores shut. Oh yes. There are cat and dog cafes here where you could come by for their meat. KIDDING. Entry's about 8,000₩ and you get a drink and you can play with the resident cats and dogs or catch up with friends while having these animals coming up to you for a pet."
4005,3.0,"While this area included some unique eating experiences (mochi covered strawberries, super tall ice cream cones, spiral potatoes, and more!), it was mostly an area dedicated to skin care and makeup for woman. Many of the stores repeat themselves on every block. Unless you are in search of skincare products, this busy street may not be worth visiting."
4006,5.0,"Myeongdong shopping street is a very exciting place. Cheap Korean cosmetic shops are everywhere, they are not only cute but also very good products for teeanagers. This is an absolutely place to visit."
4007,4.0,"Nice area filled with many shops and eateries, including street vendors selling many things and food. A lot of beauty products and sunglasses sold here. Seemed safe and tourist friendly."
4008,5.0,"Its a great place to visit and spend hours there . You can go inside many shops and get free samples inly for rntering , i collected about 20 free face masks . It was amazing !! Its also great for walking and to eat some street food . You can also find some nice cafes like the dogs cafe , cats cafe were you go and spend time with dogs or cats . Also there is the hello kitty cafe . Well i recomend ti visit and spendat lest 1 hour"
4009,4.0,"This place is packed with shoppers mostly buying cosmetics, go for the street food if not for shopping. Easily accessible by subway. Most Koreans stay away from this street and almost 90% of the people you see will be Chinese tourists lugging big bags full of cosmetics"
4010,5.0,"It's incredibly busy, but worth it.  Street food stalls assault your senses! Every other shop is fashion or beauty! This is the Korean capitalism heart if you're on a High Street budget.  Have cash in your pocket and unlike any other countries, here you're heckled by beauty store sales people who want your business, rather than restaurant staff haha!  Honestly, I feel this place is about food and beauty.  I love Innesfree for beauty/skincare, so made a bee-line and spent 45 minutes making my choices - good to know for purchases totalling over 30,000w they offer on the spot tax refund but you must have your passport with you, otherwise be sure to present the receipt at the airport. Helpfully, there was a laminated sign on the counter that told you what your tax refund would be... Check out my photos!  I love any street food vendors, but note it's worth getting there about 7-7.30 for the real buzz and you're best to walk through and browse before buying so you know what's on offer - usually: soft shell crab tempura, egg bread, meatballs, gorgeous filled cheesy mini omelette cakes (you MUST try one!) various noodle, spicy chicken, savoury pancakes, octopus/seafood and there's even a stall we got abalone! Yum! Lots of juice stalls too... We stuck with orange juice, but would also advise on taking a bottle of water with you. Once you've bought food, etiquette seems to be you move to the side of the stall, stand and eat. Then stick your trash in the nearest bin and move on. Simple and common sense.  We didn't really pay attention to the fashion retailers other than Uniqlo and TopTen both of which offered great T-shirts and about £5 a piece... Bargain!  All in all, well worth a wander... and if you're more into malls, Lotte has it covered just the other side of the road with Young Plaza, plus the high end luxury goods mall including Chanel etc. Something for everyone in this neighbourhood!"
4011,4.0,"Myeongdong is a must place to visit when you come to Seoul, cause you'll find any kind of facial products here. Plus the thing that makes me always want to visit this place again and again is the street food that open in the evening."
4012,5.0,"The title says it all. Vibrant. Energetic. Fun. Food. Cosmetics.  It gets even busier with stalls opening at around 4pm. By 6pm, the whole place was bustling with people. Cheap eats. Good shopping. What other combinations that are better than that?"
4013,1.0,Too many tourists from a certain country. Very chaotic and noisy and people shouting from all over the place. Not a pleasant place but this place has all the korean skincare and cosmetic stores you can think of and more
4014,4.0,"It is a cosmetic heaven. Every street is lined with cosmetic and beauty shops and they keep repeating. However, I feel that these cosmetic brands can be found everywhere in Korea, and the stores outside of Myeongdong have better deals??? (More freebies) Also, the street food is more expensive comparatively."
4015,4.0,Streets lined with shops - mainly beauty shops where you can buy face masks including snail mucus masks! Food stalls selling all kinds of food. Interesting experience in the evening
4016,5.0,"Myeongdong is my favourite place in seoul. It is good place to walk, eat, shopping and try some snack along the street. When i am visited in july it is summer time sale so it is really exciting. If you go to seoul do not missed to visit myeongdong and have a great time there."
4017,3.0,It just showed how Korean loves their cosmetic and skincare products. We visited on a rainy day maybe a reason why we didn't find much food stalls. For people looking for K-Pop souvenirs it's best to go to the Kpop Music Store on the 3rd Floor of Nature Republic. They sell albums and K-drama stuff too.
4018,5.0,This is simply paradise for someone who likes cosmetics there are 33 different brands of cosmetics stores in the vicinity. Go to Innisfree it is an awesome store.
4019,5.0,"Shopping, shopping and lotsa shopping. This is the best shopping area in Seoul. Cosmetics, apparels, foods are everywhere.  We stayed at Jongo which is only about 10mins walk to Myeongdong.  This area is quite big and no worries if youre kinda lost as you can always ask around and signage are everywhere."
4020,3.0,Huge crowds and very touristy. But a good place to get your cosmetics and skincare products. Also lots of trendy chain cafes.
4021,3.0,"No doubt a shopping street however very repetitive. The same cosmetics brand shops keep turns up after a with mins, they all try to get you into their shop. There are also many food stalls for a snack."
4022,4.0,"As the titles says, there is a very lot of stores here, but since this is a shopping street it's only expected. The price here is similar to the ones in Hongdae, meaning; not very cheap. I'd say it similar to European prices or American ones.  But the streets are always bustling and full of life and a few stores you only find there so it's worth visiting."
4023,5.0,"This is the place to go if you want to get your dose of shopping and Korean cosmetics, as you will have 3-4 of the same beauty brands with stores barely 50m apart from each other. If you can't find one thing you're after just try the other store down the street. It's good to come with a target list of things you hope to buy. No matter what you will end up with tonnes of samples. There is also a cute dog cafe you can visit."
4024,4.0,"It is a good place for shopping. This place is huge. We're aimlessly wonder around and got lost several times. Haha. Despite there are many similar shops with same brand, some shops do have different promotion. Beware when you take the so-called-free-gift (normally is face mask), they will pull you to their shop. It is good if you're intend to purchase anything. But if no, put your hands off 😅. Some shops do offer immediate tax refunds, otherwise they will advise you to refund it at airport (which is easy and fast too)"
4025,4.0,This area full with all famous korean brand cosmetic. the price also quite affordable and a good place have a lots of bargain. Really love this place. What more I love this place they gaves us a lots of free samples. Yeah!! we can used for travel purpose..
4026,4.0,"You have to see it to believe it... The prices for goods are not that great, and there are much better placed to shop in Seoul. But this is the tourist trap of Seoul. Go look...just don't buy..."
4027,4.0,The fun starts after dark when the street vendors come out with the various food carts. We found one with soft-shell crab. What a treat for our last night in Seoul
4028,5.0,"What to say more as the other reviews that shopping street is amazing for the number of shops, especially for the cosmetic products and if you are not a fan of that. You will be a fan of the little food places along that street ;-) So go there and enjoy !"
4029,4.0,"it's shopping street has all fashion close and cosmetics, skin care and of course food. massive area and ppl everywhere."
4030,5.0,"You must go to Line and friend shop if you are their fan. There are a huge Brown for you to take photo with. Lot if gifts to buy an d food to try. There are lot of skincare shops. But I recommend to buy them near any metro stations as you can get a tax refund straight away if buying more than 30,000 won n showing ur passport."
4031,5.0,"Pretty much an outdoor mall with lots of street vendors and lots of options to dine, and shop. What I liked the best was the fresh fruit cut and ready to consume also baked sweet potatoes, yummy."
4032,4.0,"During the trip, we can easily walk to myeongdong from the hotel which close to myeongdong about 2 km with good weather"
4033,4.0,"As soon as you get out of the train station there goes the shopping street gallore, price aren't cheap as we all hoped but we just tour as much as we can... Food stalls everywhere and they're pretty delicious... The trick is if you're on a budget don't go inside those boutiques (unless you have specific target purchase) instead keep your eye on the stalls outside the boutiques k name brands store... Plenty of well made clothing merchandise and shoes...this place is not for people that doesn't like crowd because this place is jampacked with all sorts of people☺️☺️"
4034,4.0,"Busy shopping district - lots of options for dining, entertainment, shopping (multiple stores of the same name around every corner make this a bit of a maze to get lost in...)"
4035,3.0,"i love this place so much. It's the must visit place for you who love fashion. Along the street is a make up and branded-fashion shop. You can get a good price here especially for Korean make up, and you can get a free sample :)) how great is it!"
4036,5.0,This is a cosmetic heaven! Love every inch of the street. Try the street food. You can buy souvenirs too.
4037,5.0,"I loved walking down the streets of Myeongdong! It had all sorts of wonderful eateries, every few feet! Get home made drinks squeezed fresh from every fruit (grapefruit, lemon, pomegranite, orange, pineapple, etc...) to all sorts of yummmy concoctions: flame fired squid, dumplings, korean pancakes, fish cake soup, 3 feet high ice cream cones, etc.... too much fun! AND there's great shopping to add to the wonderful food festival!!"
4038,5.0,"Even if you don't like Korean fashion this is a place to be, especially during weekend. Free samples everywhere, I would recommend Korean cosmetics, it's not expensive and it is great."
4039,4.0,"I went here with my family and the atmosphere on this street is amazing. During the evening, tons of food carts will be selling street food and people will be bustling around. I think this is a good way of experiencing Korean street food.  The downside about this street are: over priced street food, lots of carts selling similar food, and the shops along the street is also quite repetitive (you can find 2 - 3 same cosmetics shop in the same street)"
4040,4.0,Great shopping for both genders with mostly shops selling cosmetics. Street food is awesome but a tad too expensive.
4041,4.0,"Spent few days in Seoul last week and stayed at Myeongdong. Right in front of the busy shopping street. You can spent the whole day here without going to other places.  This shopping area have several streets with lots of shops (mostly cosmetics, but also shoes, sport wear ), numerous restaurants of korean restaurants, also with japanese and desserts, etc.  You must try the foods from hawkers selling all types of local snacks. You will be full if you pick one from each of them. They are tasty. But they only starts from afternoon around 2-3pm. So spend you day in the shop in the morning and stay on the street afterwards."
4042,5.0,"very tourist-y area. so food stall around here is expensive compare to other part of seoul. example roasted cheese clam, 8000w here, 4-3000w elsewhere but you're not here for the food (or clothes). myeongdong is cosmetic shopping mecca!! shop staff will lure you with free sample or even free face mask. most of them can speak chinese even more fluent than me. no english or broken korean is needed here"
4043,3.0,"As the title says, there are so many stores in this area but I am not a big shopper so that did not interest me as much as people watching. The street food was cool to look at and eat! I tried some fried squid on a stick and loved it (and did not get sick as people warned me I might)."
4044,5.0,Wandering through this food cart filled street was a highlight of Seoul. There is entertainment along the way and the food is just delicious. Go out of your way to get here!
4045,4.0,"Myeongdong is definitely worth a try, especially for the variety of food (often intriguing for one who's not used of Asian street food), the shops (lots of cosmetics, and the very trendy snail face cream), coffee shops and restaurants. It's a good immersion, which is going to request your every seconds of attention! A nice, but intense, experience!"
4046,5.0,"Everything you could possibly need is here clothes, food, toiletries, gifts, socks etc. No household wear or electronics though. Closes about ten p.m. Easy to navigate around. Ate some really good food."
4047,5.0,"there are a lot of street food in this area, which we we can enjoy it while shopping, for mosle dont worry because there are also halal food, the price is fair enough."
4048,5.0,"If you love Korean makeup and beauty care, this is the place for you. A wide selection of Korean home brands (more than 1 shop for a particular brand in a row). Often with a lot of discounts. They even throw in a lot of free samples of you purchase couple of items. If they don't, try asking them for free samples."
4049,5.0,"Another spot for tourists to seoul to do their shopping. Main street and the parallel streets full of shops with the latest fashions and trends in all clothing, footwear, electronics, etc Also food stalls and restaurants"
4050,5.0,"This street has everything you need! Esp if you're looking for Korean cosmetics! They have every brand here and what's good is that the stores are very competitive esp during weekends. Watch out for promotions or freebies during weekends. I failed to buy the weekend I was there and when I went back on a Monday, the promotions the previous weekend weren't available anymore.  Also, check out the food kiosks! Lots of interesting and unique food to try. Great shopping and foodie experience!"
4051,5.0,Too fun!! too much to see!! Lots of goodies. Great to get the souvenirs. Prices are decent and a lot of variety to chose from.
4052,5.0,Many shops and eateries good varieties. Best time to visit is from late afternoon to night. That's when all the street food and merchandise vendors are also ready for business.
4053,5.0,"It's a great area to shop for cosmetics - so many deals on makeup and skincare (especially face masks)!!! Makes for great gifts to bring back home. Lots of street food, bars, clothes, shoes shops etc too. My favorite on this street was the Cat cafe! There is a dog cafe too. I love dogs, but didn't go to the dog cafe as I felt it'd be harder to get out of it lol"
4054,3.0,"Personally I feel that this place is overrated because with regards to shopping, there are too many repeat shops - especially Korean cosmetics. A great place to buy cheap face treatment masks. The whole experience of being in a bustling and crowded shopping street in Seoul is a must when in Korea. There are many eateries to be tried - on the streets as well as restaurants. Given so many other places to see in Seoul, I would just do this once. While there, do drop in Ossulloc, a green tea cafe selling their famous green tea spread."
4055,5.0,"If shopping is your this, Myeongdong Shopping Street is the place to be. Lots of different stores, always a night market and great food."
4056,5.0,"Take the MyeongDong exit and open your world to this busy but fun shopping zone.This is the perfect place to go shop for make-up and clothes. Albeit it's a bit more expensive than the underground markets nearby, it's pretty decent and a good one-stop shop. It gets rather lively in the evening with food carts lining the main streets with yummy fried and spicy foods galore. You can also find vendors along the streets selling everything from clothes, hairpins, and purses for unbelievable prices. Even if you're not there to shop, it's fun just strolling down the street window shopping or stopping by one of the many restaurants to grab a drink. TIP: remember to shop around. You'll be seeing the SAME things in many stores and you might find something up to 10 wons cheaper somewhere else down the street!"
4057,3.0,"The street is full of stores, especially cosmetics and clothes. The place was crowded but still great to visit. All the lights are cool at night so worth to visit even for that."
4058,4.0,"Myeongdong is a busy shopping area that's full of people all day. Particularly, it's a convenient place for tourists whose looking for cosmetic shops, local clothes, restaurants, department stores, money exchange shops, etc."
4059,5.0,Not huge variety just great bustle of people and enough to keep you interested and entertained. Lost the kids a few times but since it's really one street with offshoots was OK
4060,5.0,"The street vendors are spectacular: every food imaginable, and just crowd watching is 'worth the detour'. To say ""this is where it is all happening"" would underestimate this amazing display of enterprise and energy."
4061,5.0,Very nice street to windows shopping & enjoy street foods.  Topoki for 3000 KRW & Dumpling 1000KRW very delicious and lots of other street food  Very recommended..!!!

They speak English very well."
4064,4.0,"We went there and stopped by a cat cafe for a drink and kids to play with the cats. After a rest, we walked around the street and there were lots of beauty shops with some ladies standing in front of the shops to promote their products. There are a lot of street food to choose from and ice cream stalls too. If you like to shop for Korean skincare and cosmetic, you can come and look for them here."
4065,5.0,Great atmosphere. Lots of shops and many street food options. It's easy to access by subway. There are so many people so take care.

4068,5.0,"When dropping by Myeongdong, YOU HAVE TO EAT THEIR STREET FOOD. I swear, everything I've tasted were really really good. I don't usually eat street food but theirs were—sorry for being redundant, really really good. Oh! And they have the trademark 32mm ice cream that Seoul is famous for. Myeongdong offers lots of beauty products. South Korea is famous for their cosmetics and ginseng products. You can find them here but at a slightly pricier price. We've been told that the market beside Myeongdong, which is Namdaemun, is very much like Myeongdong but the products come at a more reasonable price."
4069,4.0,"It's a heaven street that combines food & shopping together ^^ it's a must visit place for all ladies. You can find shopping malls, restaurants, street foods & street shops."

4071,4.0,Went with partner to shop for cosmetics and body products. Best pricing and concentration by far. Very value for money at a single spot. Very crowded though.
4072,5.0,We came there twice. Once at night to eat the street food and once during the day to shop. The eating was really yummy and fun experience. 2 or 3 vendors are quite filling already. Everything cost around 3000 to 6000 won. Shopping was so much fun. Especially the cosmetic stores. I was overwhelmed. And oh we went to a dog cafe too. We spent hours in there playing with dogs who are treated like kids with characters. So cute!
4073,4.0,"The market was amazing with the varieties of street food and retail items for sale. Also the market is conveniently placed nearby the local shopping district. Amazing reasonably priced souvenirs, international restaurants, a few ""American"" stores and so much more. If you're a people watcher, this is the perfect location."
4074,5.0,"Really nice walk around, lots of street stalls offering food, snacks, etc. There are also several coffee outlets to rest the tired feet. A good walk to window shop and people watch"
4075,5.0,Awesome place if you are a shopaholic and foodie. There are many stores to get a good buy especially Korean makeup and skincare. If you buy from them and are nice to them they are very generous with their skincare samples. Once evening comes the food vendors drag out their carts and sell their wares. So many things to eat. A meal made of all these food is actually more expensive then a sit down meal at a typical Korean restaurant but it's the experience that counts. Lots of interesting food to try. A must go if you can brave the crowds.
4076,5.0,Myeongdong is a area with full of shop and street food along the street. Go to here from about 5PM and find many Korean cosmetic brand with many free sample inside the shop.
4077,5.0,"Many cosmetic shops of the same brand and operating hours differ even though same company. Have to say, lots of PRC tourists around, so much so the staff at the shops are all fluent in mandarin."
4078,4.0,"It's a good place for shopping and to hang out and reminds me of London Oxford street. The other thing good about is it that had food stalls and you can try out many fresh food items from juices, snacks, to ice cream. But there is only one halal food shawarma stall or at times two. But plenty of seafood options along with vege too."
4079,4.0,"A lot of cosmetics sold here. Etude, skinfood, and many more. And theres a lot of street food and bbq restaurant too.. nice atmosphere here"
4080,5.0,"I loved Myeongdong so much that whenever I had a chance to go shopping it would be my go to place. It's got literally everything you could need from a shopping area, mostly for women, from skin care, to shoes to brands, as well as the latest food fads courtesy of new shops and street vendors. The shops are a great range of korean brands, and western, meaning you can always find what you need. I did however find brands like Zara slightly too expensive, but the korean brands sell similar products for less! I particularly went for ALand, make sure to pop in for the latest fashions!"
4081,4.0,Stopped off here ona one day visit with cruise ship absolutely loved the korean handicrafts and shops along this street. We wanted to buy so much but had limited room in the suitcase.

4083,5.0,"Tucked into the heart of Seoul, this shopping street has nice broad avenues perfect for a lot of pedestrian traffic. The streets are set in between three storey buildings on each side, and there are a LOT of different types of shops throughout. Everything is very clean and well maintained. At night this place really comes alive, with street food stalls everywhere, and loads of people selling goods from carts and streetside stalls. If you like shopping, or just want a neat urban experience, swing by Myeongdong."
4084,4.0,"The Myeongdong area is a very busy area with lots of shops, street vendors and a good few restaurants.  I would say it is worth the trip to experience some of the buzz of the city, and perhaps find some clothes for yourself as well.  If you are an European, as I am, keep in mind that e.g. a medium or a large size t-shirt in Seoul (and in most of Asia) is not the same size as back home. Also, you will be hard pressed to find shoes in sizes larger than European 44."
4085,5.0,Great food vendors and cool stores everywhere. There are hundreds are shops for teenagers and not always the same thing. Also many places to eat. I would recommend the street food
4086,4.0,Lots of people and it's shopping after shopping and more shopping - this is a great place for currency exchange since you get the best deals. Some nice restaurants and the prices are ok- pretty reasonable. I also heard that this is the place where people go under the knife and I did see a few girls walking on the streets with bandages etc...hmm...safe and a good place for endless shopping
4087,4.0,"Everywhere is cosmetic shops, cafe and restaurants. Girls will definitely love it. It is a place for tourists and therefore price is higher compare to other area."

4094,5.0,"First thing you’ll see is a big UNIQLO store, then from there endless stores front back left and right. It’ll get you excited if you love shopping. The store can get too repetitive (incase you changed your mind). They also have small food stalls along the streets. Would definitely come back!"
4095,5.0,I absolutely love Myeongdong! I fell in love with all the lights and all the stuff that's being sold here. Every street has at least 4-7 makeup or skincare stores. It's also good to try Korean street food here. I would really go back here and would want to get lost again.😂✌🏻️

It was late on a Sunday night and it was teeming with people. There are so many shops including the largest Uniqlo in Seoul. You can also grab a street snack from vendors between shops."
4098,5.0,Great place to stop by if youre looking to shop and eat street food along te way. Found more variety of street food (particularly in the evening) than other street markets in Seoul. Gets pretty busy and there is traffic occasionally going through. Try and travel light if here (no strollers).
4099,4.0,"Myeong-dong covers 0.99 km² with a population of 3,409 and is mostly a commercial area, being one of Seoul's main shopping and tourism districts. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, Myeong-dong was listed as the ninth most expensive shopping street in the world. The area has many department stores, restaurants, upscale shops and boutiques."
4100,3.0,"First day I arrived in Seoul I walked there. Since I was booked at a hotel nearby it didn't take me long to hit the makeup and beauty heaven. I had comed prepared and written down everything I wanted. And I assume I did acted as a typical tourist, now where I'm from if the store worker asks if I need help and I decline politely they leave me alone. Not here be prepared to have someone follow you around literally right behind you. If you do find something that you want be sure that they also trying to convince you to buy other items that you ""MUST"" have. It was funny the first 2 stores but after 6 it starts to get annoying. I didn't experience any of that in the clothing stores like Forever 21. Oh and if you want to experience some of he wonderful street food head there around 6 P.M. KST"
4101,4.0,So many choices and varieties to suit different budgets. Activities came alive especially during later in the night and you can shop to your heart's content.
4102,5.0,"Shoppers can go crazy with the range of cosmetics they can get. The shops give freebies with purchases and most shops will have staff who knows how to speak Chinese. The street stalls start after 11am, and it's definitely fun trying out their snacks while shopping"
4103,3.0,We went to this market with big hopes as it was mentioned as biggest flea market in Seoul but it was a bad experience for us as either the shopkeepers didn't understand english or were not ready to bargain. we came back empty handed after 3 hours.
4104,5.0,"Many attractive shops, malls and kto nearby. There are many popular restaurants and cafes here. You can try a haircut at hair salons found everywhere. Street can get crowded even on weekdays but this doesn't deter us from returning. Love the street snacks too! Very convenient location with 2 subway stations nearby (Euljiro 1ga and Myeongdong). Consider staying at hotels locates here. I'm going to return again!"
4105,5.0,"If you really love Korean street food and makeup, this is the best place to be! It is great to find anything you are looking for korean cosmetics and makeup!

Street food is awesome here! You should really really try the street food. Lots of variety as well! A place to visit in Seoul."
4107,3.0,"It was a weekday evening but it was so crowded. Shoppers are mostly foreigners (China, HK, Malaysia.. ). All the popular brands like Innisfree, Nature Republic etc are here. If you are skin care/cosmetic lover, this is the place for you. You may enjoy great discount up to 30% at certain outlets, tax refund on the spot for certain amount, and freebies! Remember to bring your passport along for tax refund purpose! Most of the Korean sales girl here speak Chinese too. Be sure to check the streetfood out too! Note: Compared to most of the outlet of same brand in Busan, they dont offer much discount and tax refund on the spot, but they can give you more freebies, just ask for it!"
4108,3.0,"Cosmetics are the big thing in Korea and this area of Seoul has countless cosmetic outlets offering everything imagineable, at discount, with freebies. It is interesting to see but, after a while, it all just gets too much.  It's well worth a visit though, just for the experience, and the street market is more varied in what it offers."
4109,5.0,"We noticed that the street offers soooo many cosmetic shops...you name it...you've got it! All are Korean brands...of course! Apart from that, there are a lot of shops selling clothes...bags...shoes...you name it! You also can find many good restaurants, including Halal eating place."
4110,4.0,"You can literally find anything here for everyone with reasonable cheap price. Girls will like the tons of cosmetic products, kids will love some toys there and food lover will be satisfied by variety of street food and restaurants. I would hope there are more public restrooms available, you have to go to subway station which is also crowded or customer of restaurants to use it. I found this inconvenience when my little one suddenly need to use it. Other annoying things is lot of sales person that trying to give you free sample on the street and take it away if you didn't enter the store. Otherwise this is a good heaven for shoppers and must go attraction in Seoul."
4111,4.0,very fun place to walk around and try the different types of food. very tourist based shopping and a lot of makeup stores.
4112,5.0,Definitely the Shopping district. Lots of beauty shops that you can buy stuff from. Just a tip: food can be pricey here.
4113,5.0,"This is a very crowded place regardless of day and time. You can get almost anything here, especially facial products."
4114,5.0,"Everybody speak Chinese and English, brand cloth, delicious street food - but it seems to me - not so authentic. Must visit as Namdaemoon market"
4115,3.0,There are lots of street food vendors. It is not the best place to shop as some of the items are of poor quality - a good place to take in the atmosphere
4116,4.0,"You will find the latest Korean craze from cosmetics to clothes and Korean street snacks here. Almost every face/body care shop is offering discounts on cosmetics and masks. If you are not ready to buy it from one street, you will likely see it again in another. In other words, no hurry to buy. There is one street that is lined with Korean street stalls so leave room to try out the local snacks."
4117,5.0,"Be ready to buy two of the same kind, you may get different colors but you have to get two pieces to be able to buy it. This area is known for wholesale market. Price is quite reasonable."
4118,4.0,"I like some of the stores in the Myungdong area, with large western brand stores along the main strip and around, and smaller boutique type shops on the side streets. It is definitely a busy street so if you don't like crowds I would suggest avoiding it."
4119,5.0,"Seoul is boring, unless you're a shopaholic or nightlife person. With a you family, THIS market is not to be missed.  You want to go after dinner, but with room still in your belly for street snacks. It's busiest/coolest late in the evening."
4120,4.0,"i love korean cosmetics. they are really very expensive. but in myeongdong, can buy at 50% off. so good value for money. huge place. a lot of tourist visiting. totally love the place."
4121,1.0,"Only operates from 4pm till 11pm. Things a bit high,foods are all done by Chinese from China. Crowded .sells lots of masks. Near subway.near lotto. Lots of shops .nice place"
4122,3.0,"But not to really shop i figured. The athmosphere is amazing. Definitely! You can find all sorts of products. Textile mostly but also kitchenware, toys and food. Anything you need. But i habe been a lot to asian Markets and so the product range didnt blow me off my feet. All the same fake and low quality stuff you need (or not). Even though they also habe some authentic korean things."
4123,5.0,Lots of skin care product stores.They give out lots of free samples if U buy from them. no minimum purchase mecessary. easy to find. Lots of cafes as well. There isa Hello Kitty cafe on the second floor along Myeongdong street if you are a fan.
4124,5.0,"Singapore has Orchard shopping street whilst Seoul has Myeongdong as its trendy shopping paradise.  Undoubtedly this place is always busy and crowd with tourists or locals, even more packed during weekend. Many shops along the street in this area are selling from clothes, bags, shoes, to skin care and cosmetics products; not to mention cafes and restaurants to lush thrist and hunger after tiring strolling around for hours.  Cons: majority clothes sizes in Korea are quite small, thus probably a bit challenging for Caucasian to find suitable sizes."
4125,5.0,This place is livelier in the night than in the daytime as the pushcarts are only available at night. It's basically a cosmetic shops street with a few clothing stores if you explore more behind (the smaller alleys). Plenty of street food but not cheap. More restaurants at the back alley towards Shinsegae. There is this spicy spare rib soup in one of the alleys which is crowded & delicious. OneDang Gamjatang Myeongdong Store 1. Tel no. 02-757 7612. Interesting street to stroll around at night.
4126,5.0,Great shopping place with a lot of selections. Tons of stores give you freebies enough to stack your whole travel vanity purse. Plenty of places where you could eat too.
4127,4.0,"Lots of cosmetic shop everywhere in the street ! Pls compare the prices 1st then go to the cheapest, some shop do duty free on the same time,some doesn't so u need to get it at airport. But korean is not as friendly as japan ! Most of them hav bad attitude!! No matter young or old !!! For my personal ,i won't visit more then one time for holidays compare to others coutry! But for cosmetic shopping I'll .  Below is some of street snack pic on the night ! And the cat cafe lots of cats for cats lovers !!!  So do recommend it for cosmetic shopping !!!"
4128,4.0,This is a good spot for a variety of food choices along with all your more modern fashion. It's a little more expensive than other areas but I think it's worth it for the unlimited accessibility to so many things.
4129,4.0,In the evening the food cars take the street so you can have your dinner/snacks on streets. Price is about 3 € per food. Sweet and salty food available.

4133,4.0,"I had late lunch/ early dinner in the colourful Myeongdong St. I enjoyed looking at the restsraunts and shops. Enjoyed a yummy meal cooked on the plate, they showed me how to cook and eat the food on the lettice leaf. With Korean rice wine off course. Didn't get to see the nightlife. If you are in the area worth a look. I went there after visiting the garden of morning calm. Together make a nice relaxing day trip from Seoul."
4134,5.0,"Myeongdong is really fun to walk around and get a feel for Seoul. There are lots of Korean brand shops, cafes and cosmetic shops, you can easily spend an entire day walking around window shopping here."
4135,4.0,"a paradise for cosmetic / skincare shoppers. mainly mid price point Korean cosmetic brands. lots of shops are bundling their masks such as you pay for 5pcs, you get another 5pcs free (or 10 for 10pcs etc). also lots of eateries, we had andong (braised) chicken for lunch. bingsu for dessert."
4136,5.0,Filled with rows of shops selling facial products and street food. One stop selection - prefer to shop here than at lotte duty free which was filled with Chinese Tourists.
4137,5.0,"Came here mid Dec 2015 just before Christmas, as a family with 3 young adult children. Just curious to visit Korea but not really expecting much. We were delightedly surprised to find Myeongdong perfect for a Christmas break. Its cold weather suited us since we live in a tropical country. The festivity of the street with lights, people, shops and food, were just amazing! Oh the street food was even more amazing! They came out in an organized manner starting sundown and very organized, very efficient and very clean! The food were a variety and all enticing to eat. The vendors were friendly and the atmosphere fun! My children felt like they were in a theme park, not knowing where to head first-- the food or the shops! Of course there were plenty of people, locals and foreigners flick here. We didn't mind the bustling crowd, heck it was Christmas season and we were feeling young & invigorated by the street activity. The street literally comes alive! We were booked in the area nearer to the Catholic church, where it was near to walk from all the activity but quiet in our rooms. There being a Catholic church in the MD area was very ideal since we heard masses for a birthday celebration, anniversary celebration and a Sunday worship in different days during our stay. The Nanta theater is also in the middle of this area, where we enjoyed the show very much. A little hole in the wall allowed us to enjoy samgyeopsal, a popular Korean dish that is commonly served as an evening meal. It consists of thick, fatty slices of pork belly meat. The meat, usually neither marinated nor seasoned, is cooked on a grill at the diners’ table. Usually diners grill the meat themselves and eat directly from a grill. It is typically served with ssamjang Korean vegetables, and lettuce leaves to wrap it in. For a family with young adults, exploring the area is like opening gifts! We felt like children in a candy store, our eyes filled with all sorts of treats. The locals were not all well-versed in English but can be understood with smiles, sign language, body language. Of course, you can't help that it may be more expensive to stay here than in other areas but hey, we want to be in the center of the action, and enjoy our 8day stay! All in all, we rank Myeongdong excellent for our first-time vacation place."
4138,1.0,"This is a crowded, VERY loud venue. Mostly uninteresting department stores, each with a sound system trying to outdo its neighbor. We couldn't wait to get out of there. Go to Insadong instead, a craft/market area that has lots of local flavor and is very fun. Myeongdong Street was our least favorite venue of our entire trip."
4139,3.0,"So many shops available for clothing according to your budget but definitely not as cheap as the local markets in Seoul. Variety of Korean Street food available for cuisine hunters. For Muslim travellers, this area is not feasible for food selection. As for Malaysian currency, the clothing are quite pricey."
4140,4.0,"Be sure you have a list of make ups you want to buy. Because you will be overwhelmed with so many choices, all promising of a good smooth skin after using ending up being able not to buy anything. Try also all the street food, its worth it."
4141,5.0,"Lovely place to get the vibe of shopping for good street food - I can highly recommend the ice creams!! Plenty of bargains to be found, and so many people jostling their way through the myriad of shops. It's a good idea to just sit and watch the passing traffic for a while. Much nicer place to find souvenirs, etc. - Korea is not a cheap country to shop in, and most large shopping centres are full of brand names at exhorbitant prices. Plenty of great restaurants to have dinner. No smoking allowed in the street."
4142,5.0,"Myeongdong shopping district attracts millions of people every year and it's not hard to see why. There's plenty of stores to keep you shopping for hours. There's also plenty of street food at night and restaurants to keep your mouth watering.  Down side is the cosmetic stores are repetitive as you'll find the same brand on every main street. This worked well for my wife as if one store ran out of a product, the next store would have it. Plenty of walking so wear comfy shoes and ofcourse accept the massive crowed If you want to avoid the crowd just go earlier in the day but I think the hussle and bussle heightens the experience."
4143,4.0,"We've been shopping all throughout Asia this past trip, Tokyo and Hong Kong included. You'll find designer and local brands here but it's not a really interesting area to explore. It reminds me of the typical brand name streets you'll find anywhere and not uniquely Korean. But there are good restaurants and shopping in this area. It's just not my favorite area to explore so far."
4144,5.0,"Should go there at night for the street food! Shopping in Korea is expensive, but the street food is amazing."
4145,5.0,here you can see value for money beauty products and delicious foods!!! must visit when in seoul and must shop all day!!
4146,4.0,"Visited primarily for the street food experience which was good although the place does get quite crowded. Tried a lot of the street food and we found most of it to be quite good. Most of the dishes will be KRW 2,000 - 4,0000 per serving. If you do try the grilled chicken skewers from Park Hyo Shin Dak would suggest taking it easy on the ""hydrogen bomb"" sauce. It is loaded with cayenne pepper among other spices and a bit spicier than we anticipated. Best time to go for food experience is after sunset -- also the time when it's the busiest."
4147,5.0,"Good places for shopping,come to myeongdong with your family! don't forget for come to myeongdong when you come to south korea"
4148,5.0,This place is vibrant in the afternoon and evening. It seems that there are more tourists here than locals. It is a great place to walk around.
4149,4.0,"I love here so much! Shopping is everywhere. I love shopping here, Korea cosmetics, clothes and food."
4150,5.0,The picture says it all. It's SHOPPING HAVEN FOR LADIES!! Beauty products as far as your eyes can see. 😂😃👍
4151,4.0,"When it comes to fashion, Myeongdong has a mix of Korean and international brands. The Korean brands are interesting as they are not global brands that you can easily find anywhere in the world and some of them have unique products (in terms of designs).  What was shocking was the number of skincare/cosmetics shops here; one brand can have several stores within Myeongdong Shopping Streets. Secondly, there weren't that many Koreans, but instead most people here were tourists.  Food was not difficult to find, but perhaps due to the popularity of the area with tourists, the prices were slightly higher than in comparable restaurants in different areas."
4152,5.0,The evening street market is well worth the effort. Great food choices and the summer nights are perfect for exploring and enjoying.
4153,4.0,"Love the street food best to come at night, shops are also opened but was mostly their for the food i came back twice in one week! Definitely should visit at least one , tried basically everything! so much to try"
4154,5.0,There are so many stores in Myeongdong. It is an amazing street to be shopping at. Do note that most of the big brand stores close around 9-11:30 PM. There are still some small shops open late at night and street food stores still on the streets. It is a huge shopping area so you might get lost. If you are going with your friends; it is best to stay together. Majority of store employees are really good at speaking Mandarin.
4155,4.0,Went to Myeongsong shopping street for street food and soak the atmosphere. Interesting to eat different kind of street food.
4156,4.0,Myeongdong is a huge market area for shopping and street food. I was staying close to this area so landed up coming to the market every day. It is always crowded. the street food is just amazing. Carry cash to enjoy the street food.
4157,5.0,"Equivalent to London's Oxford Street, only more crowded it seemed, Myeongdong is truly a shopper's paradise. Visit for clothing , accessories but especially cosmetics. Each of the Korean brands have their shops here... The Face Shop, Etude, Club Clio, Skin Food, Missha etc. and it seems one in every street!! With food hawkers, cafes and an incessant stream of shoppers, this place is buzzing with young energy!"
4158,2.0,"Really crowded, especially around afternoon until night. The staff mainly speaks Korean and Chinese, but not really friendly. Also, usually the shops are full even moving around will be difficult."
4159,5.0,"If you only have time for one place to unleash your inner shopaholic in Seoul, Myeongdong is the place you have to visit! With several flagship stores and lots of skin care stores, you'll definitely be occupied the whole afternoon. If you're looking for halal food in the area, check out the HHWT Travel Planner (it's free)!"
4160,5.0,"Great for street stalls...street food .....plenty of korean beauty shops, clothing,shoe, eye glass shops.....also lots of restaurants of all types.....the more you venture into the smaller streets the more you find......great dessert/coffee shops.....also your larger western style chains...eg mcdonalds...krispy cream...outback steakhouse etc. The markets start around 6pm and it becomes very alive until approx 10/10.30.....a must see for your trip to seoul."

4163,5.0,"Been there at least 3 times during our trip and we keep finding things to buy and there's plenty of food to eat. However, it'll be better if there's recommended place for food else you'll be walking round"
4164,5.0,"After getting dropped off, immediately bought some cut-up watermelon for 5,000 won ($4.50) at the 1st stand we saw...On a hot day, it is worth the splurge for the fam.

4180,2.0,Myeongdong is way too touristy and crowded these days.  You can find all the shops in this area in many many other areas around Seoul so I don't see anything special about this area anymore.  It used to be a great place to come for shopping and eating but there isn't anything special that sticks out in my mind.  Might be worth a quick visit to check the box but I would spend time elsewhere.
4181,4.0,Good food and shopping everywhere! Many things to buy...this is a place to come to. Things are not cheap but good quality. One could go window shopping too. It will always be a great place to shop for all and fancy.

This is the main place to buy cosmetics - and don't worry about the carriers - if you really get into it and get everything you like, they will throw in a free suitcase for you to carry your purchases. The best place to buy are smaller shops, because the amount of freebies they throw in is astonishing!  Definitely try the freshly grilled octopus, and the eggbun - they are the must have! Another delicacy is the fresh vanilla ice cream with honeycomb in the freshly baked waffle. Then, there is more, but your ""gourmet"" experience will depend on the size of your stomach! Juices and fruits are expensive - a glass of freshly squeezed orange or grapefruit juice cost around 4000 KWR! A cup of strawberries- 3000 KWR. Personally, I'd just stick to cold bottled water, which is available everywhere and costs very little, and save my money for the authentic street food, and of course, cosmetics, cosmetics, cosmetics.  Visit Lotte department store too! The place is a madhouses, but it's fun - although, I will review it separately - it is worth its own review for sure!"

Its filled with youngsters and its very happening."

The designs are nice, and the materials are usually of good quality - but, OMG, prices are shocking. You could buy 4 shirts in Malaysia, or 2 in America for the price of one in Seoul.

4251,5.0,"Myeongdong has everything you want.

4252,5.0,I live it here!! Most of the shops are opened till late 11.30pm.. there are so many promotions and if you are a korean cosmetic product junkie then this place is heaven for you! A good tip is to really decide which product or brands you're looking for... because each brand have a few shops just here... so when you're here take a look around first. Check their promotions as each shop have different promotions even though they are the same brand. And i love it when you purchase any cosmetic product you'll get free gifts... the more you buy the more you get so decide wisely! And there's also clothing shops here... korean local very good quality brands clothing and very fashionable too... ranges from expensive to affordable... just google the brands and styles which suits yours and get the Myeong-dong shops map so its easier for you to locate any shops you're looking for... for tourists there are also discount coupons we can download but i dont remember the site name... just google it and it will come out... hope my review helped! 😊

4256,4.0,"Myeongdong shopping street was great for shopping and the food stands! The area is always packed with people so there isn't really a ""best"" time to go to avoid crowds. There are a huge amount of stores selling clothes and beauty products so you can never run out of options. The staff in the stores follow you around and stick to you until you leave, which can get quite frustrating for those who enjoy shopping in peace and asking for help only when needed."
4257,4.0,"Lots of shopping, and the food....I miss it already. Great just to walk around and browse. Did I mention all the great street food vendors......delicious"
4258,3.0,"This shopping district is home to all of the cosmetic brands that Asian women--and Asian metrosexuals--respect and revere. In addition, there is a decent-sized Daiso, one of the famed Japan-based ""dollar store"" chains, in the area. The UNIQLO, a Japanese GAP, is also purported to be the biggest in South Korea.  Many of the store chains offer 2-for-1 deals, allowing a customer to take home double the amount, for the original purchase. But mind you, prices aren't cheap. Cosmetic masks seem all the rage, as of Spring 2016.  Competition is tight, so sales clerks hover, as soon as one enters any store. They obviously work on commission, as they try not only to show one a variety of goods, but also to upsell.  An interesting place not only for shopping, but also for people watching. There are numerous concrete cubes along the main pedestrian thoroughfare, where one can watch the world go by."
4259,4.0,"For those beauty product aficionados, shopping here will be definitely to your heart's content. This encompasses a lot of subway stations and will really take you a day to stroll! It is also a haven for Hello Kitty enthusiasts, for the Hello Kitty cafe is also located here!"
4260,4.0,This place is like Orchard road in Singapore but extremely crowded especially on weekends. You can find whatever you wanna find here although I would not recommend as Singapore already has everything you wanna find if you are from Singapore.

4261,3.0,"Myeongdong is full of Korean brand shops selling beauty and wellness products and they will give you samples just to pull you into their store and maybe get you to buy some of their products, but they also won't seem upset should you not buy any.

4263,5.0,"The Myeongdong Shopping District is big and well organized, whether you want to do shopping in the street, where I found the best deals for bag-packs or within the Department stores, with an incredible selection and trends but where you'll pay more. There are also some underground shops worth visiting below the main streets. Take your time and compare items as very often you'll find the same at several locations but not necessarily priced as much! You can also negotiate with the street vendors and usually get the best deal when you say NO and sort of walk away. You'll get the price you are willing to pay! We had the best Korean meal within the Lotte Department Store all the way to the top where it's garnished with a food concourse and several restaurants. There is also a street stage with non verbal choreographic performances of local pop music which is fun to watch!"
4264,5.0,"After Visiting Myeongdong Cathedral, cousins and I just couldn't helped ourselves shopping for cosmetics!"

4266,3.0,Prices have been sky-rocketed since we were here in 2012. Overall still a decent place to go shopping for cosmetics and street snacks. Plenty of people making it quite hard to manoeuvre around the streets.
4267,4.0,"Myeongdong is a busy area, full of fashion store, different shops, cosmetic brands and small restaurants, coffee shops and street food. As a plus if you are searching for money exchange, Myeongdong has probably the best exchange rates."
4268,4.0,"Good for (cosmetic) shopping, but we liked its vibe and especially the street food. There are many restaurants nearby where you could taste the local food as well. It could be very crowded though.."

4275,4.0,Great shopping for souvenirs and skin care. It is right by the subway so it is easy to get to and make sure to try the street food which was delicious.
4276,3.0,"It's not really the mecca of shopping as only mostly cosmetics and clothing are sold here. I wouldn't call it a food paradise either because I can find better eateries in Insadong. But it's certainly a magnet for the younger crowd, especially at night. This area comes alive after 7pm. Street food (mind you, they are not 'cheap', starting from 2,000 won for a tiny bun) abounds and you will be tempted to try everything! Stand along the shops and watch people pass by. It's filled with tourists!"
4277,4.0,"The place is crowded, not for people who wants nice and quiet. But you get your clothes and accessories from there."
4278,4.0,Best place to shop for Korean cosmetic products. Especially face masks. All the big brands are here. Visit in the evenings to enjoy the street food while shopping. 2 thumbs up!
4279,4.0,This place is full of street food and cosmetic shops. I loved the hustle-bustle. My wife loved shopping for cosmetics. They have a free public wifi in many places.
4280,4.0,"This is the market, with many 24-hour outlets for shopping of cosmetics. Probably the busiest shopping area of Seoul."
4281,4.0,"Shopping and skincare heaven, take your time to look around before buying. Crowded at any time of the day, the street really comes alive at night when the food carts are out. If you plan to stock up on your skincare or cosmetics, do your research as some shops provide instant tax refund now like the Laneige flagship store and Olive Young. Other than shopping, there are also plenty of restaurants and coffee shops for you to rest your feet. Visit the cat cafe while you are there to take a break from the crowd!"
4282,5.0,Main street has high-end clothing and department stores. Side streets have more souvenirs. Skin care is a hot items in Seoul. Lots of places to buy face masks and foot masks. Inexpensive items for pampering your skin!
4283,4.0,"During our brief 5-day trip to Seoul, we found the Myeongdong shopping street was perhaps the best past-of-time activity, especially at night where street food stalls abound with plenty of variety to choose.  I can't say much about shopping aspect - we did our shopping spree at Lotte Department Store which was virtually next to our hotel. But Myeongdong Shopping Street is really only 5 minutes walking distance from our hotel so a great window shopping & street food sampling opportunity."
4284,4.0,"The other name for this street is cosmo road, which itself explains the speciality of this street. You can see a wide range of cosmetics with all popular korean brand names lined up in one street. Even I, who has almost zero knowledge about cosmetics was mesmerized. Do not forget to buy Aloevera gel from Nature Republic. Also, do not overlook the street peddlars. You can find a very large variety of accessories with them which come very cheap. I went there on a day when the temperature was -12 degrees and the wind was blowing at 12 kmph speed but still the allure of the street peddlars was so good that I bought around 2 dozen earrings, each one costed 1000 korean won (approx. 60Rs in INR)  And don't forget to buy those yummy cheese sticks which you will see being cooked on open clay stove there, and potato tornadoes (potatoes are cut and twisted around a stick in the shape of a tornado and deep-fried. You get to select the type of seasoning you want on it - plain salted, cheese and onion flavours are available)"
4285,4.0,"I went at night ~9.30pm local time, after visited Everland in the morning.  The street was still busy with visitors, mostly tourist. I came here mostly for the cosmetic goods. Spotted Etude, Nature Republic, etc.. I end up spending a lot (blimey!) because the offer was too good. There were branded stores as well, and another plus is the street vendors, selling food. I'm going there again tomorrow to check out the souvenir part of the street and eating from the vendors. (it's so good, i just want to come again)  To go there: Use Line 4 and stop at Myeongdong station, exit 6. Enjoy!"
4286,5.0,"OMG, in myeongdong is like skin care heaven for ladies. From the beginning of exit of subway to the end of streets is full of various and verity of skin care shop ( well, it's not only skin care shop, but department Store n shopping mall too, but my eye just focus on skin care shop). You won't be worry of your stomach as a long the streets hawkers selling streets food, and despite of that, it's clean."
4287,5.0,Food food food heaven. Very busy. Most vendors charge 3000 won per item. Lots of cosmetic shops. Fun place to visit.
4288,4.0,"I liked this area a lot, but I liked Insadong more for what I was looking for. Lots of skincare places in Myeongdong, and trendy universal stores."
4289,5.0,"You don't have to walk too far to find a store of whichever Korean brand skincare product, they are just right there. Lots of offer 50% off or buy 1 get 1 free, so just work out exactly what you need so you don't overspend ( which is way to easy to happen). Don't buy face masks as your first item, you most probably will receive some freebies (lots of freebies possibly). Street foods are available more at night. There are KFC, Starbucks and Macca as well."
4290,4.0,"go there to stock up on your skincare & cosmetics. heard that skincare & cosmetics used to be really cheap, but realised it is not that cheap afterall. do your research and see if you can buy it cheaper at your home country first. go there for their street food, you must try their honey pancake!"
4291,5.0,"Good venue for shopping! From clothes, beauty products, food, to souvenirs. My friends like the bags the most!"
4292,4.0,I enjoyed wandering around this area. There are a few side alleys which bring you to interesting and different shops. However the proliferation of chain stores and tourist-friendly shops means that the interesting and eclectic will not last long. Catch it while you still can.
4293,4.0,"I visited at night. This is the place to go for western clothes stores (forever 21, h&m, Zara) and Korean beauty products. Many salespeople speak English and Chinese because this area is so popular with tourists. You can also claim tax refunds on your purchase by showing your foreign passport at the tax refund counter. The area is extremely crowded and noisy but doesn't feel unsafe. Lots of street food and street market stalls too."
4294,5.0,"The price of food is a bit pricey considering its street food. Price ranges between 2000 won which equivalent to 2USD-5USD. But some of the food are unique, out of this world and yummy. You'll go there again and again so you can try all of them.  I recommend the fruits especially their fresh strawberries (you can get it for 4000 won a box, 3000 won in a cup), crispy squid and shrimp is also a must try (5000 won), the egg muffin (2000 won) and the sausages(3000 won) a stick and other sweets like mochi and waffles and pancakes shaped like a fish.  There's plenty of souvenir items as well and a wide range of cosmetic brands."
4295,4.0,"Everytime I visit Korea, I have never failed to visit Myeondong. Reason being, there are so many street foods to try out and this a great place to shop for skincare and cosmetics! However, it seems like the crowd is getting more these days. For travallers who prefer less crowded places, you may consider going to Hapjeong or Dongdaemun. I strongly recommend first timer to Korea to visit here at least once! For pet lover, do drop by the cat cafe and dog cafe!"
4296,5.0,"Looking for cosmetic, clothing, food, dessert, drink, street food, or gadget? This huge shopping area has everything. Even though it is crowded, it is very clean and comfy. I think this place has the cleanest street food that I have ever seen. Here you can enjoy the true Seoul city hype."
4297,4.0,"Too many shop and restaurants and had everything as you want, too many travelers and delicious foods. You must try all stalls food on that street"
4298,5.0,"We loved shopping here! We were amazed at the number of stores. There are stores for just about everything: shoes, clothes, and of course skin care! Our favorites were Innisfree, The Face Shop, Skin Foods, Nature Republic, Tony Moly, Etude House, and Missha. And they each had multiple locations within this shopping district. The staff speak some English and were very helpful in recommending products to treat a variety of problems. The most popular items were the sheet face masks and some stores even gave some out as free samples. There are deals to be had at many stores and even among the street vendors. The food vendors sell an assortment of eats including octopus, squid, chicken skewers, tornado potatoes, lemonade, cotton candy, orange juice and others. Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks and KFC are present along with many other Korean and foreign restaurants. There are also vendors selling accessories, jewelry boxes, t-shirts and souvenirs."
4299,5.0,You can get all kinds of stuff there... although is full of people but is a great place to explore..
4300,4.0,"There ar elots of people and stores. For woman, cause there are lots of coemetic brand store,so you can buy k beauty products. But if u like to see nature,it is not appropriate."
4301,3.0,You can walk up from the area of the Seoul central station . It might take you 30 minutes to reach the ground floor of the tower and then book your elevator ticket . If you are there in April then The way will be surrounded by nice blossoming sherry trees .
4302,5.0,"If you are ever at Myeongdong, you have to walk around for shopping and the street food. We ate dinner at a restaurant but could not stop to eat street food"
4303,4.0,We where there around 5pm and lot of different shops located there. The true actions starts 6pm when electric power wagons starts to flow to scene and in now time the evening market is crowed of people.
4304,3.0,"The shop quality is mixed with some big international retailers and also more local stores. It is very busy and therefore good for people watching and soaking in the busy atmosphere. There is a huge predominance of facial/skincare shops which is very different to other western countries, and apparently is much more engrained in Korean culture. There are however many many coffee shops like starbucks, holly coffee, paris baguette etc which become very invasive and you can't get away from."
4305,5.0,"Loved this street and went back many times during my week in Seoul. If you love cosmetics, this will be heaven to you. I think every major Korean cosmetic brand was covered here - my favourite being Innisfree which seemed to have a store every 100m. We had dinner here and also watched the latest James Bond film, so it isn't all about shopping."
4306,4.0,"The people on the street were very helpful- including guides to help you find your way around the city. Plenty of shopping, although not as inexpensive as other asian markets. Clean city and feels safe, definitely a must see. Plenty of street entertainment."

4308,4.0,Whether its for food...fine dining....weird menus...best of shopping or the local food experience...it is the place to be...you have to prepare yourself and your videocam cause you will see the weirdest yummiest food in the making ...traditional korean sweets and traditional food can be bought from here...im positive you will visit this place more than once
4309,3.0,"Thursday to Saturday night teeming with tourists, lots of people. Sunday is jampacked, eating places are blockbusters."
4310,4.0,There were tons of stores and carts selling anything you could want. I would recommend walking around a little before buying anything though because a lot of things are sold at various places with no price regulation so you may find it for cheaper...aside from stores prices are usually negotiable. Easy access to subway system and buses.
4311,5.0,Never boring... with everything you need. I love to search the streets and alleys here for great Korean products. A must visit area when in Seoul if you love food and shopping.
4312,5.0,Heaven for those who likes shopping. The streets are lined with various items for sale and a wide variety of street food. The crowd even makes your shopping experience in Myeongdong a very enjoyable one.
4313,5.0,"From trendy boutiques, to chain shops, and cheap stores, there is something for everyone. Myeongdong is also a Streetfood haven. Very touristy though."
4314,5.0,"Any leisure trip to Seoul will not be complete without a stopover in Myeongdong. Even a repeat visitor to Seoul who does not shop will make it a point to drop by Myeongdong if only to feel its pulse and find something to eat. For shopaholics, Myeongdong is the highlight of any trip to Seoul, every time. International brands, new to market products, be they cosmetics/skincare, apparel or accessories, Myeongdong has them all. Cafes, restaurants and mobile food carts catering to every palate and pocket, you'll find them all on the streets and alleys of Myeongdong. In short, Myeongdong = Eat. Shop. Repeat. If one runs out cash in Myeongdong, there is always a bank or ATM somewhere. You can even get your VAT refunds instore in Myeongdong, and spend all your refund amounts again at the same place. The serious shopper will strive to get most of his/her shopping in Myeongdong done before 5pm or 6pm on weekdays. It will be a challenge to shop in Myeongdong on weekends and in the evenings when young Seoulites join the tourist crowd to shop up a storm in the city's shopping mecca. There are countless cafes of every genre to retreat to if one needs a respite after the footwork. Any visitor to Seoul who tires of Myeongdong is tired of shopping. Those who manage to book rooms in hotels at or near Myeongdong, can deposit their roundtrpĺ"
4315,3.0,"If you are into Korean skin care and cosmetics, then this is the place to be! However, if you want lots of skin care and cosmetic samples, then go to less busy districts in Seoul with better service and more freebies. However, as a visitor, it is worth visiting Myeongdong as there are loads of street vendors selling delicious korean goodies, snacks and juices.....something I always look forward to when I'm in Korea. There are lots of small and medium sized cafes and restaurants on the side streets for a bite to eat after a long day of shopping and wandering."
4316,4.0,"Nothing much to say. Just shopping and shopping. Good for lady. Product from Korea is cheap here, cosmetic, fashion, souvenir.. all you can get here. That's also lots of shop selling local food and tibits. The only draw back was, not everybody speaks English. So we encountered some language barrier. Sign language still the universal language"
4317,3.0,Bustlng with energy. Shoppers and foodies' hub. Can get crowded in most days as most tourist and locals flock to this place. Street can get clogged with the surge of people especially in the afternoon when the strrets get occupied by different food carts and retail merchandize.
4318,5.0,"Lots of shopping to do, many restaurants and street food to choose from and a lot of entertainment (people dancing, people watching, live music, etc)."
4319,4.0,"For the shopaholic, it's paradise. Designer stores aplenty, with a phenomenal range of food outlets and restaurants. The street stalls are a must see, and the local food available from them can't be missed. Shop prices were disappointingly similar (if not more expensive) than Europe, but there is literally nothing that you can't find. It's an experience!"
4320,5.0,"Our hotel's close to Myong dong so we walk back and forward the street a lot. The street's perfect for cosmetic shopping and eating out. Tried Beef BBQ and Kimchi soup here and will never feel regret. One dinner for three cost around 100,000 KRW"
4321,5.0,I went crazy shopping here. This place has endless good stuff. It even has a few halal Street food shops.
4322,4.0,With so many shops to choose from you'll need to walk through once to decide what to buy where. Fun.

4324,5.0,A lot of things to see and buy! There are many shops which offer sales and bargains. Street food here is a must try!
4325,5.0,I'm not a shopper but I loved the vibrant atmosphere and the food being prepared by the street vendors. I visited a dog cafe and a cat cafe while I was there. Really enjoyed the people-watching. It would be shopper's paradise.
4326,3.0,"This crazy shopping district is famous for cosmetics. I do not see the point why they have 4-5 same brand stores in the area, but yes each brand shop has several stores even on the same street. It's quite competitive and it means it's all at pretty reasonable prices. Some Koreans exchange money here too. Big market has the power, I guess. If you are not a shopperholic and want to see others, Myeongdong Cathedral is a great quiet place to visit especially in the evening. And the famous beef soup noodle at Myeongdong Gyoja(Gyoja is dumpling but the noodle is more famous. Their original name from the noodle - Myeongdong Kalgooksu - was copied everywhere while the idea of copyright did not exist in this country several decades ago so they changed the name to Myeongdong Gyoja with the copyright) is something you must try. t became quite touristic, but still good."
4327,3.0,The best place in Seoul for me! Many food stalls open in the afternoon and it's great to hang out in there at night! Plenty cute accesories shop and the prize is also reasonable!
4328,5.0,"Ladies will love shopping at Myeongdong! Lots of skincare stores to choose from too! Plenty of samples are given once you buy just be prepared to carry all your heavy purchases back! Nature Republc, Innis Free, The Sarm, Clio, Skin Food, Etute House and many many more! Lots of street food to try too as street vendors are out with push carts after 5 pm. I especially loved buying fresh strawberries - a box with huge sweet juicy ones only at 5000 won! You can even eat them straight away! Loved the Mouchi red bean covered strawberries sold too at 2500 won each. The juiciness of the strawberry bursts out with the very first bite! It was love at 1st mouthful for me !Then there's the really tasty Bungeoppang- or fish shaped red bean filled pancake . We've tried a number of them all over Seoul and prices vary from different locations. This one that we tried at Myeongdong was filled with cheese and red bean so it was savoury yet sweet and tasty at 3000 won a piece . At other places it's usually about 1000 won a piece ( with just red bean filling ) then there's the tornado potato , squid balls etc . Suggest you bring a shopping bag if you intend to shop here!"
4329,5.0,Shopping heaven for a shopaholic. From make up and skincare to fashion attire and street food. Everything can be found here.
4330,5.0,Definitely the shopping destination for shopping even though the place is crowded with tourists. this place has wide range of shop from cosmetic to night stand eating.
4331,5.0,"if u are not in a rush, keep walking until u find the stores with immediate tax rebates. Some stores does not have tax rebate, but u can use yr credit card to store a deposit & get immediate cash, but u must go to airport and submit the documents so that they can cancel yr credit card deposit. For example, Innisfree purchases can get cash rebate from 2nd floor of Arataum. Hope this helps."
4332,4.0,"Myeongdong is one of the favorite and a must visited place. Mall, dep store and many store here especially cosmetic store. If you a person who love korean cosmetic, its time to collect them all. Dont be worry, its cheap. If you are hungry, you can find food easily. Shopholic must be love the atmosphere. Accestable by all transportation."

4334,5.0,A lot of small shops designer labels restaurants and a very busy people all around bright lights of shop signs and great experience overall
4335,4.0,"This was a great place to hit for all the essential make up stores such as innisfree, etude house, face shop, and etc.. they are all near each other and have many other branches scattered in the area. Yes, there were tons of street food and restaurants too. This place is known for their famous Kalguksu noodle dish located in here, you could google it and TOTALLY worth it.  My friend and I hit up the Mom's Touch Cajun Chicken burgers then we went to the CGV movie theater in the mall right near the Myeongdong subway station Exit. My friend and I also lived in the 24Guesthouse for four nights and five days located 5-7min walk to the Myeongdong subway station~ It was great to have everything in one place~"
4336,3.0,"Shopping street for tourists Mostly cosmetic products, local souvenir shops. Food stalls are their as well."
4337,3.0,"This is definitely an area that attracts an insane amount of tourists, and people in general. I went shopping there in the evening and it was pretty difficult to have a proper look at anything the different stalls were selling due to the relatively narrow streets and throngs of people. As you would know, this is an area that bloggers/people would always recommend visiting. But I didn’t really see its appeal. Any of the cosmetic shops/clothing stores etc you see there, you could also find in any other shopping district in Seoul, but I guess what the location offers is convenience. It literally has every single cosmetic/clothing/café branch that you want to check out. The area is HUGE and takes quite abit of time to cover, if you are the type who likes to take your time looking for things – it could literally take up to half a day or one day. I didn’t find the shopping particularly appealing and a lot of things could be on the pricey end too. But I did manage to get some steals – a very classy looking and sturdy bag under 10,000Won and a very lovely coat for quite cheap as well. I got them off the carts along the streets. There are certainly interesting finds – some of the street food there was pretty good too and I didn’t find them anywhere else in Seoul – but you would really have to spend the time walking around and browsing. The next time I visit I’d probably skip this area!"
4338,4.0,"Expect to see multiple cosmetics & skincare shops of the same brands in Myeongdong - I counted at least 3 Innisfree outlets! They aren't as generous with the skincare samples as before, so do manage your expectations and expect to jostle with tourists especially on weekends. Otherwise it's a great place to shop around, go during night time for the screet food & stalls."
4339,4.0,For shoppers this is the right place You find all type of shops specially cosmetics and skin care Food lovers are well served seafood BBq everywhere with reasonable prices
4340,4.0,There's a lot of people and a lot of shopping. Overall the people are kind. The street food comes out later in the day.
4341,5.0,Great shopping district. lots of international brands and beauty brands. Not very cheap though. Great place to try the street food and still enjoy and experience the shopping environment.
4342,4.0,"Great vibe. A lot of shopping stores, food stalls, street hawkers. Full of crowd during weekend. I like the street experience here."
4343,4.0,"There is actually more than one shopping street in this area. The stores are more upscale then Namdaemun Market but not overly posh or expensive. There are some stalls set up in the middle of the street, lots of food stuff. There are lots of shops for cosmetics, footwear, clothing. You can easily spend couple of hours walking around here.  Lots of stores were enticing shoppers with deep discounts."

4349,4.0,"If you love shopping, this is one of the shopping centers to go! Lots of boutique to choose from....has lots of foods / restaurant to choose also!!!!"
4350,4.0,"Great place to buy cosmetics as they are many repeat shops and souvenirs and shopping. Food is great too especially the street food during the night. Try not to have a heavy dinner so that you can enjoy the street food which they are many. During this period when it is strawberry season, the fruit is cheap (you can get a good one for Won5,000) and have it in your hotel room daily."
4351,3.0,"underground shops straight off the metro linking to more underground shops. you can get carried away for hours. Interesting to see some patients, yes, I mean patients from nearby medical centres coming out in their gowns and with dressings on their faces covered with a mask! The temptation must be great and the attraction must be worth the pain and suffering they are paying for? If you are not the shopping type, just enjoy looking at all the ""perfect"" model-likes young girls parading around!"
4352,3.0,It was okay for cosmetics shopping tho I feel like it's a bit overrated as there are other spots that offer cheaper prices with as wide a selection. The food was okay tho.
4353,4.0,Almost all the same thing on each street same foods same bags same shoes. Most of the restaurants all serve same thing also. Nice experience though.
4354,4.0,"There are many repeated beauty shops here, each shop having different promotion even though they are the same brand. They give samples when you buy things from the shop. Staffs are able to speak fluent mandarin.  In the evening, more street food stalls start to operate. There are also many cafes and restaurants there. There are also many money changers here that give quite high rates, ask around first, some shops give higher rates than the others."
4355,5.0,"MUST go here for the food street at night. Clams in cheese was amazing! There are a ton of shopping places and skin care shops, its hip and trendy, plently fast fashion stores, but the food was still my highlight"
4356,4.0,"It is easy to find, a lot of shops offer Korean cosmetics, various street food, clothes, bags, shocks, and souvenirs. The prices are reasonable for cosmetics but quite expensive for souvenirs, bags, clothes and event the street foods compare to Namdaemun Market or Dongdaemun area. But still, this place offers you a unique atmosphere for shoppers."
4357,3.0,"Well, these are busy shopping streets full of stores, food stalls, etc... and people in between. Hard to call that an attraction, but I must admit that there is quite enjoyable walking there at night, checking the zillions of restaurants around. Not a must though."
4358,5.0,There are really many things to buy and eat - from mind boggling range of beauty products to yummy street food and restaurants. You can spend hours shopping and comparing beauty products. Shopping street criss cross each other and there are many intersections.  Just be careful of your personal belongings when street shopping. A great place to compare and find out about beauty products. The shop keepers can converse well in Chinese but not so in English.
4359,2.0,"The street food is on the pricey side (within the street food category) as comparing to other areas. Every second store there will be a cosmetic store, and then there are the usual clothing chain, such as H&M, Uniqlo, forever 21 etc…"
4360,5.0,"This area of Seoul really comes alive around 5pm when the street food vendors set up, we went a few times. The food was good and the atmosphere was excellent. This is a shopping area and I did look around here but it was at night that I really enjoyed the area."
4361,4.0,"10 years ago, this is where you had great look at the local culture along with fantastic local food fare.  what it has become now is a city center shoe piece frequented by mostly tourists. As such, the level of authenticity has gone down and the commercialism has gone up.  For first time visitors though, still a must-go place. there are still many gems to be found if you look as far as good local food is concerned."
4362,4.0,"This is a must if you're visiting Seoul. Aside from Hongdae, this shopping street offers variety of things to offer from food to shopping to church visit. The street is lined with branded stores as well as local stores from footwear to clothing to beauty products. Korean street food are also available everywhere so u can eat while roaming around. The prices are reasonable and for those in the middle of the streets and not on branded stores, you can also haggle."
4363,4.0,Street food were delicious even though it was slightly expensive. Bought a few outfits there and it was really crowded. Definitely a place to stop by.
4364,5.0,"This place reminds me of New York CIty, or LA, except the buidings aren't as tall. I think Myeongdong is the heart of outdoor shopping in Korea. The prices for the stores are pretty mixed. You can get expensive and cheap stuff here. It's amazing to be reminded that Korea has grown so much over the years when I went to this place."
4365,5.0,"On a 3 night visit to Seoul, stayed at Westin Chosun which is right by the market, we went to the market every evening for food and entertainment, there are plenty of street food stalls, from everything potato, squid, crab, egg toast, fried banana, coated strawberries, sweet and sour chicken, and thousands more all for eating while standing and walking. Plenty of restaurants, bars/pubs and lots of varied shopping. Busy streets at night ! Mostly closed to traffic but the occasional motorbike..."
4366,4.0,"Well as a male, I dont fancy makeups or the likes. I am just fine washing my face and neck and that is all. But since you are in Myeongdong, then go buy ladies souvenirs here coz its cheap around 20-30%. I would recommend Dongdaemon if you need to buy past 10pm as it is a 24h open though."
4367,5.0,I went there to watch the Nanta show it was a nice experience and one thing to highlight is there are not much public sitting areas almost everything is done standing up
4368,5.0,This is a shopper's or rather ladies heaven! Endless shops selling cosmetics .  This is a foodie land too. With many yummy variety of food.  The street food is an attraction too . You will be spoilt for choice .  The location is so convenient to subway ..  1 thing that I notice is many train stations cum with basement shopping mall .
4369,4.0,Ensure you stay hungry and try to enjoy street foods as you walking or shopping. There're plenty of it and some of them would suit your taste. There is free Wifi at Starbucks 2F where you can sit back and relax while your friends or family members still doing their power shopping out there!
4370,3.0,"For mainstream shopping - department stores...clothes, shoes, makeup, etc etc. Many major international brands are represented. Lots of street food worth trying. Many restaurants as well. It gets super crowded in the evening, ....and many of the shops start blasting loud techno music (I honestly wish they wouldn't!) which makes one long for the quieter shopping experience of the underground malls."
4371,5.0,"A lot of selection. The mask is dirt cheap. Man you been warn, if shopping for cosmetic not your thing then please stay put at your hotel or go walk around sampling Korean street food while your other half go banana at Myeongdong"
4372,2.0,"Despite the large crowds, the area has become more expensive! The food stands cost a lot more than other areas and it wasn't good. I had some fried skewers that's supposedly chicken but the texture wasn't chicken and it sure didn't taste like it, either. I wanted to buy a simple and sturdy luggage bag but the least expensive one was W80000 while later on I found one that's adjustable in size with wheels at Nangdaemun Market for W20000. I bought a set of five ceramic soju cups for W5000 at a touristy place in Jeju-do but the exact same set cost W10,000 in Myeongdong. They no longer give as many samples as before at the skin care stores. The Missha store refused to honor the 10%off coupon issued by VisitKorea.com. Disappointing!"
4373,3.0,"Competition is strife. There will be repeats of many standard makeup stores, and there are a couple of clothes stores but nothing quite sales-y like the street fashion in the underground stores. However, the store clerks are well-versed in either Mandarin or a bit of English and are super-attentive to your needs.  I dislike the crazy crowds that come here, but it would be a must-visit if you must shop in Seoul. I preferred going to Hongdae or the underground malls for my shopping thrill."
4374,5.0,Amazing place to shop at for everything from clothes to makeup and much more. The street food is a must in this location.
4375,4.0,"Myeongdong is a shopping street with lots of street food, restaurants, clothings, accessories and cosmetics shops. It is super crowded at night. Experience the 'pasar malam' (night market). Interesting place to go at night. Myeongdong also has underground shopping. If you can't stand the cold nights during winter, just shop underground😁"
4376,4.0,For people who likes to shopping it's would be the best choice to visit this place.. You can get so much bonus.. The place is very crowded..
4377,3.0,i don't like too much crowd so this place was not that OK for me. went there for the famous myeongdong kyoja and left as soon as i finished lunch. awesome for those who are in seoul to shop!
4378,4.0,"Very nice place to walk around at night ,safe and live. You can try some korean food ,fruits and juice. Free activity not to be missed"
4379,3.0,"Look I get it, the street is primarily dedicated for tourists so it's a given if you see more tourists like Chinese or Japanese than Koreans but I feel like the street is waay to overrated for anything. There's a lot of better korean beauty shops with better promotions and hangout place like Sinchon or Hongdae and waaay cheaper stuff in Namdaemun or Dongdaemun market. The only tolerable thing in Myeongdong for me is the street food. Anything else? I'll find them someplace else, thanks."
4380,5.0,"It is an understatement to say that this place can overwhelm your senses. We visit Myeongdong as often as possible. We love the sights, the different foods, the crowd and we will continue to visit often for as long as we live here. If you are in Seoul for at least two nights, this is one of the places that you need to come and visit. it is very civilized despite teh crowd. For 5000 W you can enjoy one of many selections of food from octopus to banana crepes to ceramic-like sugar cookies, to chicken. I highly recommend this shopping area. Oh yeah, there are many western stores here as well."
4381,5.0,"You could find all the cosmetic, fashion, living products there. Also, it has many restaurants surround there and almost shops will be closed around 22:00. Moreover, it has many street peddler after every 17:00 you must try some special snack of Korea. It's yummy. Lotte department store also there. 3D Stuido, Shooting Centre, some shows there."
4382,5.0,"tons of shops,millions of people,great atmosphere early in the morning. You can find anything you are looking for,shoes,clothes,cafes,big brands,food stalls."
4383,4.0,Good place to visit you can pick up a lot of big brand stuff but prices aren't anything to write home about but go for a lunch there plenty to do around it and the nic nak stores are good.
4384,5.0,"You can find everything here...cosmetics, clothes, restaurants, accessories, mani/pedi, massage, hairdresser, glasses, many currency exchange places with good rates..."

4386,5.0,A really buzzy area with many different shops and loads of coffee shops. Easy to get to on the subway and it has lots of yummy street food options.
4387,2.0,"Many stores and its an eye opening if its your first time in Seoul. We enjoyed the food stalls selling all types of street foods. However, we are a bit turn off by those chinese speaking sales peoples who trying to hard sell while we are walking past the shop."
4388,5.0,"This is a beauty zone, but if you are not into it, go in the evening when the food stalls are already put up. Then you will find lots of local delicacy to try! Otherwise, dive into the cheap but wonderful skicare offers!"
4389,4.0,"Lots of shops, mostly global brands a few independent retailers and Korean Brands. You can probably find most stuff you need and it's cool to wonder round."
4390,5.0,This is a more upscale shopping street that was teaming with young adults and so fashionable looking. There are also numerous cosmetic shops and cafes. Good location to find some stylish apparel.
4391,4.0,"Plentiful food choices around the area. BBQ Pork Belly, Beef Broth, Abalone Porridge, Cafe serving shaved ice desserts, fried chicken korean style etc etc. Not forgetting the various street food you can get here. Street food ain't cheap but it's an experience.  Of course, there's the many beauty houses selling their beauty products to the large tourist and local crowd."
4392,5.0,"One of Seouls busiest and exciting centers. Lots and lots of shops and restaurants but truly comes alive at night when the street hawkers come out with their food and tons of people walk the streets and alleyways. This is not a small area At least 2 big Pedestrian roads about 500 to 700m long crossing and bunch of smaller alley ways. One end of Myeungdong is actually the Cathedral which is Seouls primary Catholic Church , the other end of this main street is the Lotte Department Store complex. There are also theatres to watch shows and the likes. Lots to see , eat and do. This is full of tourists but even most locals come here to shop and eat as it's complete (as per our Korean tour guide who shops there). Many visitors to Seoul come here a few times on their visit to try the diff cuisines and just people watch."
4393,4.0,Mainly shopping of the young and trendy. Some street food during evening and for those who simply adores Korea taste.
4394,3.0,"If you're a tourist here, it's worth stopping by on your way to Seoul Tower, but the it's SO crowded, it's not really the greatest place to spend a lot of time. I prefer to do more of my shopping in Hongdae and other areas around Universities that have smaller shops and you don't have to weave your way through jam-packed streets."
4395,5.0,"Try to time your visit in the evening so you can experience the night market with loads of street stalls selling food, Knicks knacks, clothes etc."
4396,5.0,Excellent street food. Great shopping. Fun cultural experience. Seoul is very safe. Street food is clean and hot. Noc concerns whatsoever. No problem walking around late at night. Super friendly people as well.
4397,4.0,Interesting and colorful street filled with delicious street food stalls especially during the evening time. Suitable for young adults and even older people during Spring time!
4398,4.0,"If time never ends, you can spend forever shopping and eating at Myeungdong and you probably still have not finished your shopping and trying all the street food... Myeungdong is the no. 1 choice for tourists for street food and shopping for cosmetics and face masks (which you should know by now Korea is famous for). Take note that it's mainly for tourists so ya street food prices are relatively high. However you are here to enjoy. So take in the crowds, enjoy the street food and buy lots of face masks!"
4399,5.0,Great place! Great buzz! Lots of shopping and lots of food stalls.  I enjoyed and loved this street and it was nice to see other cultures selling here like Turkish ice cream and Indian shawarma with a Korean twist.  A must visit!!
4400,5.0,"This is one of the shopping area for everyone. As it is tourist area, there are free translation service. Just look for those people with tag, they will answer all your question which free of charge.  Actually what they are selling here can be found elsewhere at lower price but since they are concentrate in this street, it make it easier for foreigner to get all the things they need at one place."
4401,5.0,"I love this place, lots of food and cosmetic shop. Girls would love to browse stores around. I have planned to visit Korea again by the end of this year, and Myeongdong is one of my destinations."
4402,5.0,"Went here on a Saturday, packed with people. Yet so few tourist compared to other Metropoles. Try the street food and and just enjoy the buzz."
4403,4.0,"The shops are fine but really nothing you can't find in a hundred other places. The main reason to come here is for the amazing street food at night, some of the best I have had anywhere, especially the fried mozzarella with condensed milk (trust me, it tastes a whole lot better than it sounds) and the pork meatballs. We ended up eating here every night."
4404,4.0,"It is a shopong district full of cosmetics, clothes and local street foods. It is easy to reach by metro line blue and stop at myeongdong station. The prices there are bargainable, although it is already at cheap price. The food were really good. You can try the afternoon and night street foods. The foods were tasty and costed friendly."
4405,5.0,"For those who love street food and street shopping, you may come here. Lots of cheap stuff here. From fashion to beauty products also available. Just to remind, make sure you wont get lost on your way out. The streets junction looks the same everywhere. The crowds are crazy especially during the weekends. But for sure you will enjoy the experience."
4406,4.0,"I came here during the day and during the night.  So basically its two different environment.  During the day basically you go there for shopping, there are some big brand like NIKE store, Tommy Hilfinger, Club Monaco and many more big brand such as H&M Zara. My advice do walk the alleys, don't just stick to the main road.  At night time, it's a different story. In the main road and in the alleys it becomes a night market. You have small stall setting up shop around the road. One thing that I realised is that the arrangement is quite proper, so you should feel safe.  The food or the stalls and shops are basically all the same around the place, they sell the same thing in between the area. For example there are several octopus, food street and other items sold in different areas of the shopping street.  Basically its a mixed between food, merchandise, drinks and mobile phone covers.  A little warning the price is not cheap. Things are sold from 3000-8000 (Baked Shellfish) but it's good to get a variety taste of Korea Street Snacks. Most of the stalls is now run by Chinese people I believe."
4407,5.0,It probably has one of the best currency rates for money exchange. Lots of shops there. Great atmosphere at night time.
4408,4.0,"There are 5 to 6 streets that interconnect so you'll never get lost here........just have to make a note of certain landmark. The street traders only come on about 430pm onwards but many of the eateries operate from around 10am onwards. Most offer local food but I found a couple offering really good Japanese fare if you wish to take a break from kimchi. Those made-in-Korea socks are cheap and good for KRW1,000 to 2,000 . But slightly larger sized ladies, I would give most clothes a miss because 90% is one-size-fits all. If you walk towards the north-east corner where Metro Hotel is located, there're more cafes and western eateries and across the road there's Lotte. Note those steet foods prices are variable ranging from KRW3,000 to 10,000 . But if you go this period, the local strawberries are a must...200% sweetness and cheap. The baked cheese in a stick, cuttlefish, scallops, fishcakes, etc are for the adventurous only. Every other shop is selling Korean skincare products. The masks are really cheap and comes in different 'treatment'. I like the night atmosphere and it's fun."
4409,5.0,"This is heaven for shopaholics! Every store you can think of and a couple more are here. A couple of hours aren't enough. Living in a island, I'm not used to see that much people, but it was ok. You just need to be out of people's way so you don't get push to the side. March is the perfect month to go. Is in the 40-50 almost all day; so it was nice."
4410,5.0,"i loved this place soo much that we went there 3 times during our 5 days stay !! great for skin care purchasing , great for food, and people watching .lively atmosphere"
4411,5.0,"This is a heaven for a shopper... And also street food hunter like me... A lot of cosmetics shops, fashion products, and street food. This place is so crowded, even more in the night."
4412,5.0,"If you subscribe to the 10-step method of korean skincare ritual as I do - look no further - this street is the Holy Grail for all things Korean Beauty. HolikaHolika, Faceshop, Etude House, Too cool for School, Iope, Nature's Republic, Club Clio, and MORE! Walking through this street for me was akin to the experience of stepping into Disney World in my younger days. So many inviting shops with so many things I want to try. All the stores stuff bags with free samples with every purchase whether you buy a lip gloss or an entire carry-on suitcase worth of merchandise. Sales staff are friendly and many speak fluent Mandarin (since this is a hub for tourists from Mainland China). Around the side streets, you can find lots of vendors hawking all kinds of delectable street food from sundae, to dokbokki. Very affordable and delicious after a long day of shopping."
4413,5.0,Go every where you can on your trip to Seoul. Friendliness abounds and you can buy just about every thing.
4414,5.0,"It's a MUST place to visit while in Seoul . Cosmetics shops , fashions , K-pop CDs all found here with reasonable price even cheaper than subways underground market . Fancy handphone cases for Apple iPhone and Samsung also easy to grab. Cute and pretty jewellery with low price selling here may also grab as souvenir for girls."
4415,4.0,The shopping here is insane! So many stores all full of the same thing for blocks. Some of the women in the clothing stores are extremely rude and will shove you inside their stores. Those who sell hats on the street sell them for higher prices than other neighborhoods of Seoul. But the street food here is really good.
4416,4.0,"Throughout 10 days of our Seoul trip, we visited MyeongDong 3 times. On crowded days, MyeongDong is busy and packed with tourists. Many salespeople in MyeongDong knows how to communicate in Mandarin.  The streetfood in MyeongDong is also great. One of the best I'd tried. It is also the to-go place for cosmetic hunting."
4417,5.0,"I stayed near Myeongdong Subway so Myeongdong Shopping Street is very near to me. Come here by night as they offer so many stuffs and food items by vendor and when you are best in haggling, you can really do so. Though in buying souvenirs, i do not suggest this place as prices are higher by about 2,000 to 3,000 won compared to Dongdaemun Shopping Center. For cat and dog lovers, don't forget to drop by at Cat Cafe and Dog Cafe!"
4418,4.0,"We love Korean cosmetics and it's very easy to find many Korean cosmetics here. We love to shop here because you'll received many Korean cosmetic sample if you're shopping here! Not only Korean cosmetics, you'll also find many clothing store, many food store, many coffee shops and many more. Its complete and we love it.."
4419,4.0,"Here you can buy exclusive brands, but also low price stuff on the small narrow streets. Street food and restaurants everywhere."
4420,4.0,Enjoyed the shopping. Caters to those seeking a deal or high end shopping. Sales people are friendly and not over bearing. Great food to be had in the area too.
4421,5.0,"If you like street food, shops, more food and more shops, this is the place to be. It was lively and bright with endless selections of grub to keep you full and things to buy to keep to wallets empty! You will also get lots of freebies at the cosmetics shops and the price difference from RM to Won is truly jaw dropping, ie, the cosmetics are so darn cheap here! And the selection seems endless. Be careful with the sales assistants' lack of English though, 80000₩ sounds so much like 18000₩. Shopper's paradise through and through."
4422,3.0,"You can see so many stores especially make up stores and clothing. I bought so many ""skinfood"" for my friend (they gave me lots of masks as bonus) and you should ask for tax refund there)  And there are many street seller for food, accessories, tshirts for kids, etc. The price are not cheap for food and tshirts (compare to my country)  But maybe you should try to ""insadong"" some people said it is cheaper."
4423,5.0,"Any lady that is visiting korea must visit this place. This location is packed with cosmetic stores. If your hotel is not close by, bring a small suitcase because makeup and face mask can get quite heavy. My hotel happen to be right in Myeongdong and I enjoy every day staying here. There are many street food vendors but sadly I did not get to try since there were so many good affordable restaurants here. Also, I suggest you know your makeup prices before shopping here. I found Lotte Supermarket had 50% off sales that weren't offered at the locations in myeongdong."
4424,4.0,"You can literally satisfy all your shopping needs in Myeongdong, especially for cosmetics as every alley has at least 5 Korean cosmetic boutiques! They used to give more samples with every purchase, but nowadays you might actually have to ask them nicely if you could get more samples. Still, a great place to shop nonetheless!"
4425,4.0,"A long street lined mostly with apparel shops and cosmetics stores (multiple branches of different brands), plus streetfood stalls on the sidewalks (Yum!). Not really a place for bargaining, but you can score makeup freebies from different stores. Be prepared for the crowd though."
4426,5.0,My most favorite place in Seoul! I would always come here every weekend! I just love to just roam around this wonderful street.
4427,5.0,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is full of people all the time, more so early evening when locals finish work and buy from street vendors selling really yummy snack food, you really need to try steamed egg buns, delicious. Shops galore, from beauty shops to handbags, clothing, shoes, more beauty, cat cafes to sip a hot chocolate while relaxing by a window watching the world go by with a cat on your lap or around your shoulders, different experience. The atmosphere is amazing, staff trying to coax people inside shops with all sorts of discounts. Busy,busy,busy"
4428,4.0,"The vibe is lively, the street food can be greasy, and how many cosmetic shops can be squeezed into about 8 square blocks? Still it's fun! Open early (for Seoul) until late."
4429,5.0,Enjoyed looking through the shops; most shops accept credit cards and speak some English; loved trying food from the street vendors
4430,4.0,"If crowds give you energy, this is the place to be. If crowds take energy from you, then maybe this is a place to pass. There are abundant clothing shopping opportunities in this area."
4431,4.0,"Area full of shops, especially if you are looking for Korean clothes and make up and restaurants. You may feel a bit scared about the confusion but it's all part of the experience."
4432,4.0,"I am Malaysian, so, I found that the snack in korea is expensive. the pancake is selling 3000KRW, flower ice ream about 4000KRW & etc. but they are not selling higher price in myeongdong although this is tourist attraction point, its generally high in seoul."
4433,2.0,明洞 is one of the most famous places in Seoul. you go there at least once but you don't have to go there again.
4434,5.0,"We love this places very much.. We are shopaholic.. And the street full of stores. We can shop every step ..

Highly recommended for shopping lovers."

4436,4.0,"Makes for a good walk, streets are organized by goods. Its easy to grab severals bites of goodies to munch as you walk along and window shop. Very close to the metro."
4437,4.0,"If you love shopping. This is the place to be. I am not a shopper but I enjoyed the atmosphere especially with the bright lights at night. Various street food to eat , which is what I enjoyed most."
4438,5.0,"It is a great place to buy cosmetic, masks and other skin care products. I bought so many things here. I wish I could come again. The only downside is that some of the shops are a bit aggressive sometimes."
4439,4.0,"When you first set foot in Myeong-Dong, you can easily tell that it's the place where men and women, both locals and foreigners, gather around to find the best value in cosmetic and facial care products.  If you are travelling with your wife or your girlfriend, you should definitely visit this place the moment you arrive in Seoul. It is one of the places in East Asia where you can buy branded cosmetic products for a very low price. For husbands, there are a lot of food stands that could easily occupy your time while waiting for your wives to finish shopping as they can be found almost everywhere in Myeong-Dong area. Korean Delicacies like Odeng, Gimbab, Eomukba, Muneo Dari Gui,and Egg breads can easily be found in the shopping street if you're feeling hungry, but if you're looking to eat steamed silkworms, you'll only be able to find them in older traditional markets or in Nandaemun.  There are almost 2000 cosmetic stores to get lost into in Myeong-Dong, but in the end, just tell your wife that you're travelling on a limited budget. All in all, it's a fun place to experience street food and cosmetic shopping, but if it's electronics that you want you'll be better off in Yongsan's I'Park Mall."
4440,5.0,"I absolutely loved the atmosphere there. There are food stalls everywhere where you can try weird but delicious foods and there are many shops to visit. However it is very crowded and it's not always easy to watch out for pickpockets. I was aware of this so I put a padlock on my backpack to keep the pocket where I had my wallet and passport safe. I put some money in a tiny purse around my neck and just like that it went fine. Do not let yourself be scared of pickpockets, just be prepared and enjoy the busy Street."
4441,5.0,"It is so interesting shop there so many kind of things to do there : you can buy clothes, cosmetic, bag , shoes and there's also a massage and nail place. There is a lot of street food and global food like Macdonald and burger King it's so amazing. However, if you don't like crowded place you won't love it and for less crowded go on working day not the weekend. Hope you like as I did."
4442,5.0,"For those who loves Korean cosmetics and street food, this is the place you would wanna go. They sell cosmetics and most of them provides tax refund service as a lot of travelers find this place is a must visit when they're in Korea. So no worries about your tax!"
4443,3.0,"I think it's cool to visit the 'in' thing of Seoul shopping district but then again, this area is just crazy flooded with tourists. Well if you still insist on going, come after 4pm or so, the food stalls start setting up and the crowds get their new diversion.  I did witness a fight along the street though, so well it was refreshing."
4444,5.0,"If you have not been to a traditional ""market place"" in Seoul, you must not miss it. If you have been there before, you must visit again. It is a shopping area that attracts both locals and travelers. As you walk down row after row of streets and side streets, you are presented with an endless array of shops, restaurants, sidewalk attractions, and so forth. You can see waves of people, young and old, just walking and browsing the streets, eating street food and having fun. Across the street from the southerly entry, you can dash over to the Lotte Department Store where pricey goods and designer shops are available, as well as duty free. But when you are in Myeongdong, you must visit the street level places or you will miss an experience. (In years past, this was also an area that attracted pick pockets; due to aggressive law enforcement those sights are rare now but you should still be on your guard and not lose your personal belongings even inadvertently.)"
4445,5.0,"Great spot for street vendors food, shopping and entertainment. Loved it. During the day the vendors aren't there so not as lively but still lots of shops. Around 430-500 everyone was coming out."
4446,4.0,Myeongdong to me was a food haven. There's just a variety of street food and food shops around. Not to mention shops (local and international). The place is clean for a very busy place. I went there during the night time but I am not sure if it is as lively during the day.
4447,3.0,"This is a place with many fashion shops, and there is a nearby metro station. Also there is a nearby bus station for getting up a City Tour Bus. This is not surely a must see place if you have little time in Seoul."
4448,5.0,"This hip area has all the things you are looking for! It has shops of all types and you can wander in and out. Some shops found it necessary to follow us around, make up stores mostly, but it could be their jobs, but it was fun to look at all the amazing products. There are tons of tents that set up with food and other shopping possibilities! Cat playground was fun too!"
4449,5.0,"We came here almost every night of our stay in Seoul, and every time we find something new! Facial and cosmetic products aside, you will find street stalls selling all sorts of Korean delights (only at night) and little shops selling clothe items and accessories (bags, shoes etc) at very good prices and very high quality too. If you are a bargain hunter, then MyeongDong is not to be missed!"
4450,4.0,Many international and Korean fashion shops. If you like shopping go their and downs a half day strolling thru no cars street.

4452,3.0,"This is always our first stop on our return to Seoul, mainly because our hotel, Lotte, is located round the corner, and also because we love the variety of food options here.  Unfortunately, our usual beef restaurant, Bulgogi Brothers, has closed though we found a beef and bibimbap eatery, Gogung, with the help of the tourist information bureau. This is also the place where the family buys face masks from Skin Food, Too Cool To Be In School, Body Shop and other similar shops.  At night, there are street stalls along the main thoroughfare, and you should try the fries encrusted corndogs, kimchi pancakes, grilled scallops and dessert options like strawberries. Of course, they also have the usual shops like H&M, Uniqlo, Adidas and Zara."

4463,3.0,"This place lives by it's name, make-up street. If you have a make-up shopping agenda, do go to Myeongdong. However, I think it is better to shop in shopping malls (more comfortable at any time).  There are lots of street food. Some are very good, especially the grilled cuttle fish. There's passion fruit juice looks really good but we were full. It's really hard to abstract juices from passion fruit because of the seeds. But the juice is pure.  There are lots of dining in Myeongdong but I find it more expensive than Insadong. I prefer dining in Insadong or in restaurants in shopping malls."
4464,4.0,"It's a must visit if u are in Korea !

4466,5.0,"I've been to Korea 3 times in the past 5 years. Call me crazy but I love the place. Every time I go I stay in Seoul, and more specially, Myeongdong! I know this place like the back of my hand now and I never get tired of it. I've stayed here with friends, colleagues, and on my own and in every scenario it has been so much fun. Filled with great restaurants, shops that go on forever, 24 hour bars, and a great view of the lovely Namsan Tower every now or then, what more could you want?! While travelling alone, I always worried about being bored in my spare time. But staying in Myeongdong solves that problem right away. I spent all my free, alone time there shopping for clothes and makeup, and eating delicious food. Seriously everything you need is in Myeongdong!"
4467,5.0,A long length of stores in a street with lots of street foods that are clean and are properly handled. Sellers are honest and cheerful. Most Stores close at 10 pm while some at 9 pm. This is a must visit place while in Myeongdong.
4468,4.0,"I have been here three times, two times with my family (one that when I was a primary school kid and one that when I was about to start my uni), and my most recent visit to Myeongdong was by myself. I kind of witnessed how it has changed over the past years. It is a major tourist attraction for shopping for many years, but it has become more and more crowded by tourists, especially after K-Pop got its popularity internationally roughly since 10 years ago. Even most street hawkers can speak Chinese, not to mention those in cosmetic stores. The upside is, there will not be any language barriers for all Chinese, English, Japanese speakers during their shopping, but the downside is, you will not know what the local Koreans like if you only visit this place, since I don't see many locals around (The most frequent languages I heart in this place are Cantonese, Mandarin, English, and to certain extent Japanese). For those who are interested in clothing, cosmetic, accessories, etc., this is a shopping paradise. But for those who want to know what the ""real"" Korea is like, this is not my suggestion."
4469,4.0,"I had a wonderful experience in Myeongdong. Even most of the visitors are youth, but it is fun to go there with family. I strolled around Myeongdong in a day and it's not enough. If you go with your friends or family who have a different interest from you, you don't need to worry about that. For a cosmetic lovers, you can find many cosmetics shop there. You already bought some but you still want more with the same brand, such as innisfree, nature republic (that's what happened to my mom)calm down you can just walk a hundred meters and find the store. What about food lovers? of course you can try various kind of street food or restaurant food there. You can choose any kind of food that you want at any price it depends on your preference. My friend prefer to eat street food than restaurant food, and 2 or three food is enough to make your stomach full. Accessories? Still it is heaven for you. You can look and find any kind of accessories whether in the street or in the shop. So have a good time at Myeongdong"
4470,5.0,Great experience at night when you can also indulge with a wide variety of street food while enjoying the colorful neon light signs.

4472,5.0,"It was crazy! If you go to the Myeongdong subway, you will find cosmetics stores lined up but most of them cater to Thai customers. You go up those stairs and you will find an alley full of stores that mostly cater to the Chinese customers. Walk a bit more then you will find the alley catering to Japanese customers and others. I literally got a headache from all the hubbub. Leave your credit cards at the hotel if you don't want to be deep in debt. TIP: Missha often has 50% off days so wait for those."

If you're feeling tired and hungry from all the shopping and walking, you can grab a bite at the cafes and restaurants scattered around the area, or you can buy food from the food stalls that usually open during afternoons."
4487,4.0,"If you want to get your skincare / cosmetics items, here is a good place as it is a one stop station for all brands! Most of the shops has staff who knows Chinese and English more of Chinese I would say"

I enjoyed Lotte and Shinsegae, the two big department stores, where I purchased everything from seaweed and red gingseng to handmade jewelry, Tumi luggage and unique scarves. I preferred Shinsegae to Lotte because it was less crowded and the merchandise was very nice, including unique Korean made clothes."

It's even great just watching them prepare the food whether it be deep fried squid or meatballs to pancakes with chocolate and banana it is a fantastic experience.  As for the main shops. If you are in dire need of aloe or snail face masks this is the place for you...really! Every other shop sells the stuff! No wonder the locals don't have a wrinkle between them haha! There are clothes shops, main chains, and they are no better prices than the UK or US.  I was looking for a tech shop and after an hour of searching gave up hope. Ended up buying a face mask for the camera instead!"
4493,4.0,"If you're looking for cosmetic products then you got to the right street. Various beauty product brand in this street.  Food wise there are many restaurants however price can be on the high side and not necessary the best.  If you're looking at purchasing fruits, there are many stalls there. Try going to lane which is less people, you will get better bargain compared to the stalls at the Main Street.  Keep an eye on the on coming motorbikes and cars. It seems a bit dangerous to me as they maneuver around the crowded street."

4507,3.0,"Went there for the free hankok costume fitting for photo taking at the Seoul Global cultural Centre. It is very crowded on both weekdays and weekends. A lot of skincare and cosmetics shops. I printed out the discount voucher from the website but couldn't be used at the skincare shop despite the coupon says so. Prices for cosmetics and skincare are more or less the same as other shops in Seoul.  Many good and reasonable eateries in Myeongdong. There is a very nice Dakgalbi in Myeongdong. It is a Korean dish with gochujang (chilli pepper paste) marinated diced chicken, stir-fried together with sliced cabbage, sweet potato, scallions, onions, perilla leaves, and ddeok (rice cake) together on a hot plate. You will see a long queue outside the shop and that is the one.  Shopping is generally more expensive there especially at the underground mall. I bought a K-pop badges (4 pieces in a packet) at 10,000won and k-pop poster at 15,0000won after she gave me discount in the underground mall but when I walked past a push cart stall near the Seoul Global Cultural Centre building, it is selling only at 6000won for the badges and 12,000won for the k-pop poster . Thus please purchase at this push cart stall for K-pop products."
4508,5.0,"Alright, so if you've got won, Myeongdong will happily take it from you. It is a labyrinth of stores, places to eat, more stores, a theater, and my favorite: street food.  So if you're into skincare, you'll find your paradise in Myeongdong. All of the brand names are here: Olive Young, Atrium, Holika Holika, Skinfood. . . the list goes on. Honestly my only complaint is each alley of Myeongdong seems to have the same skincare shops on repeat. But if I'm honest with myself, I love it, too. There's also clothing stores, too, like Uniqlo, Forever 21, H and M, and more luxurious brands, like MGM and a few others.  There's tons of restaurants. People will stand outside and guide you to them (some of them can be very tucked away!), others are right out in the open. Honestly, you just have to spin the bottle and pick a place - there's so many, you could eat a meal a day here, and it would probably take you a solid year to get through them all.  Finally, if you wait until ~3-4PM, the streetfood vendors come out and oh my lord, I always think I've died and gone to heaven. I LOVE the streetfood here. My favorites are croissant fish bread, and a stall that sells waffles with ice cream. It's always packed, but the food's awesome. Eat out here, and be prepared to spend at least 20$ on food, you won't regret it.  Myeongdong has something for everyone. The skincare lovers can drop 4$ on skincare products or 150$ in a single go, and likewise you can spend 10$ at a cheap store or $3,500 on a bag at MGM. It's all up to you. But go to Myeongdong for the atmosphere. You'll love it.  And when you get bored, go over to the cat cafe or the dog cafe for a nice relaxing drink. You won't regret that, either!"
4509,5.0,"This is a shopping street! And it's pretty big street and a lot of choices to choose from!

I like it of course because I can sample the various snacks they have there and there is a wide variety. My wife likes it because the cosmetics are pretty well priced here and of course Myeongdong has her favorite stores Forever 21 and H&M. There is also a rather exhaustive list of restaurants available and I’d recommend that you research them before actually eating there. This place made each of my family members happy as it contains something for everyone so I consider it a great place."

4550,4.0,"It is a labyrinth of clothing stores, makeup, restaurants, and cafes. With tons of street vendors seeling knock off good and street food. Although I didnt buy anything while walking around here it is worth a look to just walk around and see all the flashing neon lights rising up the sides of every building competing with each other in who flashes the brightest.

If u visit myeongdong at night there will be many small stalls along the streests selling korean style snacks, accessories and clothes!if you never try korean corn, it can be very different as the texture is sticky and soft instead of the crunchy and sweet we normally have! After all Myeongdong is the best place for everything!!"

4562,5.0,"Wonderful Place to wander around and explore in. Hundreds and hundreds of shops, restaurants, cafes, kiosks, and more. Brightly lit, though quite crowded, it's certainly a place you should stop as a tourist if you're looking to shop. The hotels in the area are also all very helpful, stop by the front desk at any (I stopped by Loisir right outside the metro station - great staff) and be treated to some helpful tips and directions."
4563,5.0,"Briefly paseed thru the market during a short stay in Seoul. This market had a wide varietry of foods, produce, seafood, clothes, fabrics and so much more. Every time I turned down an alley I found a new type of product or food. They have every kind of seafood eels to octopus. If food curious and adveturous, you can sample the many Korean street foods and traditional dishes. If a crafter, they have all you need. Don't be affraid to haggle price as you can get some great deals."
4564,5.0,"I love this street! There are tons of stores and shops that all offer different things--from tourist-y souvenirs to clothes to handmade dishes and arts. You will never walk away empty-handed, and the prices are always right!"

4569,4.0,"Definitely a great shopping paradise for all tourists.  You may get everything from there. You don't have to find a good restaurant in Seoul, and I am sure the shopping street may bring ""sweetness"" to your tastebuds.  Prices generally were cheap and would suggest travel in group and can share among the foods along the streets."
4570,4.0,"I was in Myeongdong last year (2015) September, and was kind of surprised by the area of how many tourists are there, especially people who speak Chinese. Almost all stores that I visit and even the sales people standing outside giving out the samples, they all speak Chinese. To me, I think they do a pretty hard sale, following you around the store, super friendly with you, giving out bunch good words to their products. I am not a beauty experts that I usually just trust the brand that I know, so I am really skeptical on every claims that they are making since everything is well packaged. Anyhow, I still ended up buying some lotions face masks...It can add up expensive that I am not sure what I am paying for. (expensive than the normal US drug store brand, but cheaper than the duty free shop brand). But, they seem working well on me so far. No scary breakout yet. So, the conclusion is that, taking away my skepticism, I had a pretty fun time shopping in Myeongdong."
4571,3.0,"For those who are looking for korean cosmetics,it is a good place to go. I think this place is quite complete. The price is also reasonable and lots of choice. Visit this place a bit earlier so that you are not trapped in a crowd."
4572,5.0,i love the street food and the shopping area. there are a lot of great shops and restaurants around. although crowd can be too thick at times.
4573,3.0,Myeongdong is a must go and see to experience for 1st timer visit to Seoul.  That area has become too crowded for comfort due to the at least 200 Street food stalls. Although one is able to pick up various brands of cosmetics as well as sample local creatively done street food there. But how is one able to enjoy street food while standing and try to avoid beening pushed or be an obstruction? .There is hardly room to move around due to the narrow space and large crowd. Good experience though for 1st timer there.  Just be brave and enjoy.
4574,4.0,"Most of the stores sell beauty products, some brands such as etude, nature republic, faceshop, innisfree have its store in every alley or street. Most of the sales speak multilingual, mandarin and japanese are most commonly. Street foods stalls were open since morning and more stalls open in the evening."
4575,4.0,"It is an obligatory for foreigners to come here, who never heard of Myeongdong right! It's like your Korea trip is incomplete without visiting Myeongdong, a shopping heaven and cramp with peoples! lol. So many things u can check out here, like gazillion cosmteic shops, trying Korean street foods, famous Korean boutiques, acccessories, Cafes etc. Almost everything can be found here. Since I stay nearby Myeongdong, I came here every night, eventho I have nothing to buy."
4576,4.0,"According to my wife and my daughter, this place is a must because they have all you can imagine for cosmetic...all brand both international & Korean brand and its cheap."
4577,3.0,"This neighborhood was without any doubt authentic at some point in time. Right now it is a street filled with tourist shops and shoppers traps. I would only recommend this street if you were to look for souvenirs. For a real taste of authentic old town, go somewhere else."
4578,4.0,"This was a very interesting and fun part of town. My favorite part were the food vendors! Make sure you bring cash to enjoy the many treats available for purchase. There was a variety of stores, with the majority focusing on beauty products. I arrived around 8:30pm and stores were already starting to close. I was disappointed."
4579,5.0,I went twice on my visit to seoul and never get tired of shopping at this place. You get many options and different products. Beauty products are natural most of them and super good.
4580,5.0,"This place is buzzing with street vendors, name brand cosmetics shops, and hordes of clothing stores. I personally liked this place to people watch, enjoy the various street food and the general buzz of the area. While the restaurants aren't really the best here (in my humble opinion), there are some reliable Korean chain restaurants in the area and really wonderful street food stalls. It is worth a visit....even just to walk around and feel the energy."
4581,4.0,"A must try place especially the cat cafe and the street foods. In winter, it's especially nice to enjoy the area as all the street foods will definitely provide warmth and cozy feeling. Shopping wise, it's the center of all shopping you want for most stuff."
4582,5.0,"Lots of delicious street food!!! Also a perfect place to buy souvenir for family or friends. also lots of make up store such as: Face Shop, innisfree, skin food, beyond, etc. should by your make up here, it's cheaper than in my country. and also there's cute line stuff at LINE STORE!! :):)"
4583,4.0,lots of free mask being distributed to entice you to go into the shop. No purchase is needed. Food is on the 2nd floor so don't just look on the ground level.
4584,4.0,"When you think of a big city, what image flashes through your mind? How do you feel about crowds of people, fast speed, or delicious food. Those are just symbol of Myungdong in Seoul, Siuth Korea. Myungdong is lively city. There are many young people and tourists in Myungdong. The young people are energetic and tourists are very busy because they have spots tour. They cannot do anything slowly. The place many people are always many delicious food. Do you wnat to meet many young people or tourists? Do you wnat to experience a lively city? Do you want to eat good food? Then visit Myungdong, you are going to love it."
4585,5.0,"Bought a great suitcase at a very reasonable price. Ate in the nearby food court, amazing efficiency. Do not go there if you are a shopaholic. There is so many things to buy."
4586,5.0,Interesting place to do shopping or just to hang around and to see locals cooking some street food. A great number of different shops and cafes
4587,5.0,"This is my 4th time in Korea. Every visit I will visit Myeongdong Shopping Street. This year i choose a hotel near Myeongdong Shopping Street and stay there for 5 days. I have visited Myeongdong Shopping Street every night for the past 5 days. Do not give a miss if you visit Korea. Outstanding shopping area with lots of shops, street foods and restaurants. Get ready you wallet and spend."
4588,4.0,"If you don't like crowds, don't come here. A normal night here is like NYE at Times Square. A million people jammed into streets lined with retail stores and restaurants and little food cart stalls. It is an experience that you have to do in Seoul."
4589,4.0,"my second visit to seoul and found ourselves in myeong dong for at least 3 nights for shopping. whole district of skincare shops and clothing boutiques. walk further and you will find lotte dept store and shinsaegae. it is a nice district to stay in during a holiday but I find that certain things eg. street food is a little more expensive than the university areas. all in all, a fun place to shop! you can easily shop in myeong dong the whole day and visit namsan tower nearby."
4590,4.0,"I didn't come here for the shops. I came here for the street food, fresh juices, food on a stick, food in a cup, even jap jie noodles in a cup, and the cutest socks in the world!"
4591,5.0,"Myeongdong is a must when coming to Korea. It's a shopaholics heaven. There are department stores on one side, (Three, to be exact) and streets and streets full of stores and food vendors on the other. (Be sure to bring a lot of cash because there are a lot of crazy and delicious street food and they don't accept credit cards!) My friends and I shopped from morning to night. I am a major shopaholic, and the only problem for me was that almost every store closed at 10. I wanted to shop more :,( But overall, it was really fun!"
4592,4.0,"This is a pretty big place and it is quite crowded even in winter. Hold on to your small ones because it would be difficult to find them if you ever lose them. It's a great place to hang out with friends as this place provides a lot of cafes, restaurants and street food. Definitely a place to go to. For some of the more popular restaurants, make sure you arrive at 11am, otherwise you'll have a difficult time finding seats."
4593,4.0,Lots of food vendors and the same cosmetics shops over and over again. You can walk up and down these streets for hours. Lots of great deals too. Great place for Korean cosmetics. Full of tourists and can get very crowded.
4594,4.0,"Great street! Very near our hotel. Love the food vendors! Restaurants, coffee shops, beauty stores, convenient stores everywhere! So much great stuff to eat, look and do! Lots of good vibe with place!"
4595,4.0,"I went there twice during my stay in Seoul. I speak very little Korean and zero Mandarin, so I felt pretty confused here when the sales people talked to me in Mandarin constantly. It is busy and full with tourists. I love all the street food like deep fried crab, LOBSTER yes!, Octopus skewers, fresh pomegranate juice, fruits, etc. Also, the clothes, shoes, etc are very fashionable, lots to see. Since I am a big fan of BigBang i bought hats from a street vendor that gave me some discount LOL Enjoy Myeongdong! it is awesome!!"
4596,4.0,Different kinds of cosmetics available along the street. Prices are affordable and lots of promotions going on. Must visit !
4597,4.0,"for cloths shopping, and shows at night, this is a street with the last trendy fashion if you are in SEOUL for Shopping"
4598,4.0,"The Myeongdong shopping area in dowtown Seoul is very much like the pedestrian shopping zones of most medium to large cities in Europe, with many of the same chain stores. One difference is the crowds that are like Marienplatz in Munchen during the Christmas season ... on a Tuesday in July."
4599,4.0,"Been here twice. Sept 2013 and recently last Dec 2015. The place is complete from food, fashion, make-up and more. My guesthouse is just a 3 min walk to Myeongdong so every night I went here. Definitely one of the my favorite place in Seoul"
4600,4.0,Since we stay near by so we had visited almost daily during our Tour trip; we took Korean Strawberry; Baked Sweet Potato; we buy cosmetic and specially LINE Store
4601,4.0,"Literally! Shops open in the morning until late at night. It is packed in the evenings with store employees having different gimmicks to attracts customers. With beauty shops (IMHO) as the most number in this area. Clothes, jewellery and souvenir shops, both international and Korean are everywhere. Cafes and restaurants are also available but try some street foods, they are cheap and delicious. Just be careful when walking through the crowd because sometimes cars and motorbikes drive through the sea of people. I was luck enough to see the Kpop group when they had a meet and greet in one of the shops."
4602,5.0,"Its a very good place to shop and eat! There are a major variety of street food and shops. Although, the variety of things to shop are for girls and yuppies, but its still alright."
4603,4.0,"Surrounded by shops, shopping malls, street foods and local korean restaurants, and easy access to metro, airport bus and taxi, I think it is perfect for 1st timer in Korea. However shops around there do not open early, so if you are stay in that area, breakfast selection is limited."
4604,5.0,"The number of options to eat and shop are almost overwhelming. The bright neon signs and the shop keepers hollering at you to enter their shops are quite a sight. It can be fun exploring among this vibrant crush of people, if you know what you're getting into. I would definitely recommend going at least once."
4605,4.0,"I practically came here at least 3 times during my 3-weeks stay in Seoul. There are lots of shops, almost all the facial/ cosmetic brands are here. Many local clothing brands can also be found here. There are also trolley stalls in the middle of the streets selling the latest fashion at very affordable prices. If you want to have some streetfood, you will be spoilt for choices here too. Seoul has a lot of coffee chains and you will definitely see them at myeongdong. Even if you are not buying anything, join the never ending crowds and window shop!"
4606,4.0,was there during the countdown. there were people everywhere. a good festive mood. there were lots of shops and eateries along the many lanes. very easy to get around. There is also a subway right at the entrance. .
4607,4.0,"Went there recently to check out the shopping and see that there are lots of things to buy: fashion, cosmetic etc. Local food too and also Western fast food. One could spend an entertaining day here for shopping and eating...."
4608,5.0,"Staying near this street, so only walking distance from my hostel. Many things can be found here, anything kpop, socks, keychains, coats, anything! And the street foods are yummy...just go here if you are in seoul."
4609,4.0,"Not really a ""must-go"" attraction, but you should definitely check this place out! Although many shops and restaurants can be found elsewhere, the atmosphere is lively, especially at night with the food stalls.  It is very big, as in one afternoon is not be enough to visit everything (if you're into shopping). If you're not a shopper, you can walk around the neighborhood in a little over an afternoon no problem.  Mornings are pretty boring here, you should come here at around 2 pm (when the food stalls start coming and setting up in the middle of the street) and spend the rest of your day here. Speaking of food stalls, you should definitely be careful of what you eat. We visited here during hot summer days and one of my friends bought fruit juice and got a stomach ache. I guess because of the heat, the juices went bad. For hot food, it is OK! But if you're unsure (like me), watch the person make the food and ask for the food that just came out of the stove so you know it didn't stayed in the heat for a long time.  Another great thing about this place is that there are walking ""Information guide"". They wear red t-shirts and give out maps to tourist. If you're struggling to find your way and happen to come across these lovely ladies/gents, they can surely help you find your way back.  There are 2 subway stations, so access to this shopping district is pretty convenient."
4610,5.0,"We went here just for a wander around and to soak up some atmosphere. The shops are the same ones you get all over Korea and there are multiples of each one! Whilst not too keen on shopping, we did love the buzz of the area and most of all the street food! It's cheap, plentiful and you can have some banter with the stall holders. Definitely worth a trip or two!"
4611,4.0,Lots of facial product stores and woman's clothing stores for the ladies but not a lot of stores appealing to males. The street food that rolls out in the afternoons and into the night is a must try
4612,5.0,"The area is a criss-cross of quite narrow, semi-pedestrian streets. Plenty of restaurants and clothes shops with a few more touristy shops but these are heavily (HEAVILY) outnumbered by skincare shops. I had no idea the Koreans were quite so obsessed. Realistically, I would guess that anywhere between a third and a half of the shops in the area focus on skincare. Still an interesting place to wander, especially at night when the pretty lights go on and the street vendors come into their own. The street food here is fantastic, fresh scallops, steak, kebabs, strawberries, waffles; barrows selling a huge range of delicious food. Don't come for a snack, come for a meal!"
4613,5.0,My family loves roaming around this area! My kids are young and this was the first place where we stayed on the streets beyond 10pm. There were lots to look at and lots of good food on the streets. The streets are crowded but had great atmosphere.
4614,5.0,"Interesting part of seoul. Good local crafts. Try to go into the back streets for some great food! Remember it is a tourist area. If you want to shop, best to go to the shopping centre near Bongeunsa Temple"
4615,3.0,"Make no mistake, it's not the cheapest for shopping. What I liked about it though is that it has several stores to choose from. During our visit it was raining, so we didn't enjoy hopping from one store to another."
4616,5.0,"You can find cheap and trendy finds in this area..from accessories, tops, bottoms, shoes and all sorts of cosmetics! Vendors can charge you really high especially at night so I advise you to visit the small shops because they have cheaper and more unique items. Also, never shop here on December 24 because the street is super CROWDED. Everyone is doing their last minute Christmas shopping so better go before the 24th or after Christmas! Enjoy!"
4617,5.0,There was so many vendors sellings all sorts of goods from wallets to shoes to good. All competivelly priced and friendly pepople.
4618,3.0,"This area is a great shopping zone with many shops and malls. However if you are plus sized, this may not be the place for you snce the trendy clothes are for the skinny or slim cut... Largest sized pants are size 40.  However, if you are small to medium built, this will be one of your places for clothes.  Being a shopping district, you can also find other items you may fancy including many brands, but you will need to take your time.  Lotte world also has its shopping centers here."
4619,5.0,"Oh where to start . If clothes and skin care are your thing this place is amazing . Brand name stores such as Zara , H & M , uniqlo as well as endless small shops selling Korean made / styled clothing . I found Zara cheaper than in Australia but uniqlo more expensive . The are hundreds of skincare stores . Split up your purchases as they give you samples every time you buy something . They do give you more if you purchase a lot , but I found spending $100 or $200 made no difference , so you are better off buying in two lots ."
4620,3.0,"Taking the metro , there you are right in the shopping center. An old theatre with hundred shops linking to each other full of cosmetics from head to toes. Nothing special , very exciting. Just I happened to see a traditional wedding show perform to attract travelers is the only thing which attracts me. Otherwise it is just another cosmetic shopping which the Cosmetic Manufacturers made millions on their products; an attraction to Asian women in countries nearby."
4621,5.0,"So many western options and many make up stores! Definitely change your money in this area. The rates are great. I got 178.5 when the rate at the time was around 181. I mean at the airport it was 163.5...so yeah! This is an exciting place to be, it is full of life and busy! Many coffee shops as well!"
4622,4.0,We sort of stumbled on Myeongdong and glad we did. Was good to see the famed shopping of Seoul and try some street food. All very condensed and we were out before we knew it but worth a visit and go hungry
4623,3.0,This place is just too crowded. If you are planning to go here to shop at the beauty shops I think you would be better off if you shop elsewhere since these beauty shops can be found all over Seoul.
4624,5.0,"What this place is, are rows and rows of shops selling cosmetics to cafe to massages services to apparels. You can most probably spend the entire day here and still have not come close to checking out each and every store. It doesn't help that across the street is lotte and shinsege where the shopping continues.  Girls and women who are into Korean skin care and cosmetics, look no further. If you have only one place you could go, this is it. Boys and men not swayed by the k craze, park yourself at any one of the many pubs and bars in the area with a book or a fully charged tablet.  The shops are by no means unique. If you are not familiar it can all get pretty confusing as you leave an Auritaum shop turn a corner and there is another Auritaum shop. Repeat that with innisfree, holika holika, nature Republic, vdl, etude house, skin food. The list goes on and on.  I would also like to high that if you like the UK brand Lush, you can find it here.  Finally, there are also plenty of massage parlour in the area . This is good to know when your feet are barking at you after a full day of shopping.  Only drawback is shopping is out in the open which could be inconvenient when it rains or snow."
4625,4.0,"This shopping area was so busy especially with the holiday season. Tons of restaurants and shopping! But make sure to eat at restaurants only if there are a lot of people. We went to 1-2 restaurants that were quite empty and the food was not up to par.I can't imagine driving and parking nearby so def take the subway or taxi.  If you're into the facial masks cosmetics, make sure to stop by each one as you can easily get a bunch of free samples. A lot of the sales staff would be standing outside and they'll speak Korean, Chinese or English to get your attention."
4626,3.0,"Let me clarify my review title, I love the location on Myeongdong if staying in Seoul. However, I do not necessarily like Myeongdong in particular. You can find some pretty good restaurants, but everything else is just average. The shopping experience is just one of claustrophobia."
4627,5.0,"Samples galore! Korean beauty houses like Etude House, Innisfree, Nature Republic, TonyMoly, TheSaem and so many more all have multiple stores in this little shopping area. It gets crowded quick, so better to get started earlier in the day (before lunch). Most stores will be handing out samples during peak hours, either in your shopping basket, or directly into your hands as you walk in. When you buy items, don't be shy - ASK for samples too! Worse thing that can happen is a polite decline, which rarely happens.  Also, lots of amazing street food vendors too - red bean fish croissants, tornado chips, egg-in-sweet-bread, deep fried squid, fresh strawberries, just to name a few!"
4628,5.0,"Our visit to Myeongdong was one of the highlights of our vacation. There is a certain buzz about this place. Be prepared to spend a whole day here as there is plenty to do. We shopped, enjoyed a good galbi bbq, watched the 'Nanta' play, and gobbled down street food. The outdoor market that starts in late afternoon is another must. We did find the prices to be a tad costly for street food."
4629,5.0,"This is sensory overload - the sights, sounds and smells are so intoxicating! The sheer variety of shops and their wares, is mind-boggling. I made several trips back to this area, and still didn't feel that I had done it justice. Plenty of reasonably-priced Korean restaurants, so you can shop and eat without leaving the area. Particularly good to visit at night (I visited in winter), when the street vendors prepare and sell a huge array of local foods, some of which makes for good souvenirs."
4630,4.0,"I loved seoul and this place made it fun! Good buys and bargains, easy access. You can spend a whole day there and have fun!"
4631,5.0,"Many shops that specialises in skin care, toiletries and cosmetics. The shops offered various discounts for tourist and tax refund (min. W30,000 per receipt). Moreover, there are numerous eating places, a dog cafe and 2 cat cafes. There are also many money changers that gave very good rates without commission. A tourist shopping paradise."
4632,4.0,"Be careful if you go to this area during weekend. Very crowded! However, you will find a lot of nice food stalls along the street and it's worth to try some!"
4633,5.0,Many Choices of beauty products and eateries; lots of lots of people - Visited Two Two Chicken Twice here...

Go around after 5pm and the vendors will be out preparing. There's snacks like escargot on a stick, cuttlefish, fried bananas, fried chicken and lots more.  Myeongdong can be quite huge for first timers and easy to get lost as there's many side lanes, so it's advisable not to split up for first time visitors.  There are restaurants deeper inside myeongdong and usually on the upper floors."

4675,4.0,Liked roaming around in this area with good shopping and eateries option. It was the only area which was open late night for shopping and a lot of tourists.
4676,4.0,"As other reviewers have said, it is touristy in many respects with the same merchandise, perhps higher prices in restaurants etc. Knowing that fact, I would probably not eat there but it still was a fun experience to wander around if you have the time and I loved watching my Grandaughter bargain with them knowing very little Korean but just enough to know when they were trying to take advantage. Also as others have noted Namdaemum is perhaps a better option if you only have time for one area."
4677,5.0,"If you are a shopaholic, Myeongdong is surely a place to visit and shop. All kinds of trendy stuffs in this area and could see the 'hip' things."
4678,3.0,"This is a very crowded place but what would you expect of a place where shops especially skin care are all here?  Very excited as I love shopping and I know I can grab a lot of skincare products cheap. And I was right. Not only I'm pampered with lots of options especially skin care, I'm pampered with the skin care samples they give out freely. You get lots more samples if you buy anything from them. This is excellent concept as I can go back and try before deciding if I will buy.  However after about 2 hours there, I got rather bored as the shops lack variety. Many shops of the same brand are within walking distance. The size of the shops are similar meaning you won't find things exclusive to like perhaps bigger stores.  Nice place to shop but you do not need a lot of time there."
4679,3.0,I found Myeongdong too touristy. I asked some local people and they said that they would avoid going to Myeongdong as the restaurants there are quite pricey. Shops are meant for selling stuff to tourists. Street foods there are at least 1/3 more expensive and less tasty than those find in other areas such as Namdaemum.
4680,3.0,I was looking for some items and was told to look for them in this location/market. was looking for it for hours. not again!
4681,4.0,Good place to shop and have plenty of street stores. Many good restaurants too. Very crowded but alright to go. The stuff selling there slightly better quality and designs and of course you pay a little bit more. The is a MCM boutique there in case you are looking for one.
4682,5.0,The streets are always full of people both local and tourists. There are plenty of things that you would like to buy especially cosmetics and local food. I visited Myeongdong every night when I stayed in Seoul. This is a must-go place in Seoul.
4683,4.0,"If you don't like shopping, don't come. I had one goal in coming here and that was to stock up on Korean skincare products. They have them in abundance here. And if you can't find the item you want at one store, chances are there's the exact same store around the corner. This was actually a little confusing because I kept getting turned around. But there are people in all red walking around with an ""i"" on their hat that you can ask if you need help finding somewhere. Speaking of skincare shops though, they all have people standing outside waving free face masks in your face to entice you to come in. I even encountered someone who grabbed me, yes, literally grabbed me and tried to drag me inside. I had to forcefully shake her off, and needless to say, I didn't visit that store. If you go inside, someone will literally follow you around trying to help you (make you buy something). They speak English at most stores, but they seem more comfortable speaking Mandarin. If you buy stuff they usually give you some free samples of other products to try.  One other thing to note is that it's very busy no matter when you go. And even though there is so much pedestrian traffic, there are still cars that force their way through the crowds, and even worse than them are the motorcycles. They aren't concerned with you and will drive extremely close to you and would probably hit you if you didn't move. I found this really irritating.  The buildings look really cool and each one is unique. There are lots of places to eat and snack. Most of the shops are geared toward females though."
4684,5.0,"Anyone who's been to Myeongdong knows...if you want to torture your male better half...bring them there!!! It's just a girly heaven with numerous skincare, cosmetics and cheap fashion shops...definitely not the best dating place in Seoul."

4689,5.0,"We really enjoy this honeydew ice cream, it make of a whole really honeydew fruit. Layer: honeydew + sweet milk + ice cream + red bean.

This is packed with people every evenings, I found less people in local comestic shops as you can get a better deal, if you buy a lot, from Lotte Duty Free which is just nearby. The roadside stores like night markets in Taipei. Perfect to spend few hours walking around, especially from 6-10pm every nights"
4692,5.0,"Great shopping place especially for Korean Beauty Products. Every corner they have shops like Etude, The Face Shop, It's Skin and etc. When buying from these stores, do not forget to ask for freebies. Also ask for a tax refund receipt. You can get a tax refund for a minimum purchase of 30,000 Won. I had a great time here. Taking the subway, use Exit 6 of Myeong-dong Station (Line 4). From here, it's a walking distance also to Namdaemun Marktet."

It ended that we bought for us too. We're very lucky because it was a Black Friday sale for some of the famous brands like Skin Food and Nature Republic! Good to note that every store that we went to has an English speaking person. The place is very busy and the streets are lined with kiosks offering different street foods so you will never go hungry. There are restos around if you need to dine and sit. You need to wear comfy shoes because you'll do a lot of walking and ensure that you have enough Korean Won to use to purchase because most of the stores accept Won. It's worth coming back."
4695,3.0,"Too touristy and many PRC salesgirls are selling the Korea skin care and some Korean made product. the night market that set up at 530pm nightly are much more expensive, what you see there , you can get them easily at Underground shopping center which are plenty ."

4702,4.0,Myeongdong area has a lot of small boutiques especially for skin products and clothing. There are also small eating places. Uniquo is also anchored there. It is a very busy area any time of the day. It is more for younger age.

Make sure to visit around other cosmetic stores of the same brand because not all of them are doing the same deals. one store we went to we purchused 10 face masks. visit the same one a few walks down and they were doing 10 + 10 face masks same price. Try the street foods and a few restaurants speak english. I do not recommend Outback Steak House there...really bad service."

4727,4.0,"It is extremely crowded. We came here at night to buy cosmetics as South Korea is famous for their skin care products. There are so many cosmetic companies here, you don't know where to start. I would suggest doing some online research before coming here. The stores here entice you with buy more, save more tactics. And they load you up with free samples with each purchase. Socks are cheaper here than Insadong by a few won. But the alleys around Dongdaemun are the cheapest. I am not sure if this area is the cheapest for cosmetics though. I find the prices quite comparable to other places."

In our 6 days in Seoul, we always go here in the evening for that window shopping and nice stroll.  Filled with food carts selling Korean delicacies, as well as all sorts of cosmetic and beauty shops in every corner offering absurd sales and discounts, this is a haven for the shopaholic.  To add, you can also find here themed cafes of which I really looked forward to such as the wonder dogs cafe and hello kitty cafe. Accessible by train or even walking, I find this a nice place, comparable to evening shopping districts in Singapore and Malaysia, the only downside is that I really find Korean products super expensive, so prepare a thick wallet."
4730,4.0,"A ""must do"" when visiting Seoul. You need a whole day maybe even more to shop around and compare prices. A good place to buy anything a woman needs to remain and keep oneself beautiful. And you don't need a small fortune to buy the things you need."

4735,5.0,"There's such a variety of items here, you could find almost anything here. But I was most impress with the food vendors who sells very delicious Korean street food. I like the fish meat on skewers, the rice rolls in kimchi sauce and the potato ring on a stick the best.

4737,4.0,"I think all tourist will visit Myeongdong at least once during their visit to Seoul, I was there at least 4 times either browsing around the shops or having a meal in the vicinity. The place is full of young people, there would be cosmetic shops everywhere, the same brand would have at least 5 outlets or more, it's amazing...this is the place to buy cosmetics. There are also international Brands like H&M, Uniqlo, New Balance besides local brand that sells clothing, shoes, bags, souvenirs etc giving a wide choice for shoppers. In the middle of the pedestrian only road, you would find stalls selling local food including fried cuttle fish, crabs, potato chips, fruits( persimmon and strawberries in season) plus many others. Myeongdong also house a number of restaurants, cafes both local and international bands, Starbucks and Hollys coffee would have at least 5 outlets each. Towards the end of the shop lots you would find a number of seafood and Korean restaurants serving the working local crowd. There are also a number of hotels as well. It's a place you can almost find all you need, I would recommend this place."
4738,1.0,"I was looking forward to the markets, but this place was a horror! Piles of used clothing that looked like reject pile from goodwill. Just a lot of crap. They have really poor quality ""designer"" bags, and stuff, but priced as though they thought they were real. Wait, you're calling that really bad thing with the Cs, Gucci? I looked at the very poor quality fur hats snd vests, the prices started at 900$ no buddy, 50$ would be a stretch. only thing decent was the street food."
4739,5.0,"Stayed in Seoul for 2 nights, went to Myeongdong both nights. Every night i bought something. Clothes, shoes, socks, cosmetics, knick-knacks, food more food. Everything so inexpensive. A must go in Seoul n"

4741,3.0,"I, personally, feel that this place is a bit overrated. It's a large shopping area where you can find any cosmetic brands. Some brands even have more than 3 outlets around the whole area. You can also find other international clothing brands, such as: uniqlo, h&m, zara, nike, etc. And there are some street vendors that sell korean street snacks & other goods which was interesting (more interesting to me than the regular shops on the side). Don't forget to visit the Korean Culture Center at M Plaza if you're in this area so you can do some activities for free or a small fee, including photos with hanbok (free)."
4742,5.0,"I had a great day shopping here. Lots of the shops had sales, and I was able to buy my international favourites at a fraction of the cost. The main walking streets are wide, and I didn't feel jostled or claustrophobic at all (although I was not there in peak season perhaps?). Worth a visit, even if just for window shopping at the variety of items on offer."

I'm a plus size girl but I did find a Japanese store where I could buy bras here. Im an H cup in that store lol who knew. In american I'm a DD. If you are looking for bras to fit you ladies you can find them here.
4745,5.0,This place is amazing! Even if you don't have anything to buy you will buy something. The cosmetics here were too hard to resist. Come on the right days and you will find yourself in the midst of huge discounts for cosmetics. You can literally spend a day or two here burning a big hole in your pocket.
4746,3.0,I personally find that there is nothing much to buy at Myeongding. Lots of Korean beauty and cosmetic products. Perhaps this place is good for the ladies as most of the shops carry clothes just for the ladies.
4747,5.0,"Need I add more?? The super famous area for the land of Korean beauty and fashion, u can find all the major beauty brands here. The amount of samples each shop gives out has dwindled over the years, but it's still a highlight while shopping for skincare and makeup here.  It gets super crowded during the evening everyday, only thing I don't like is that the shops close at 10ish.. C'mon for the beauty Mecca that is Myeongdong, I expect the whole place to be alive till late.  I went there around 10.30pm and all the streets were practically empty...  Good if the shops close late."

It's near Namsan tower, I actually found Myeongdong underground market while I got lost coming down from N tower and was looking for a subway. Around 5pm the street food vendors come out in drones and the streets are filled with delicious aroma and the vendor themselves are sites themselves. There are cosmetic ladies promoting their product, bright lights everywhere as were many plastic surgery clinics. One was even named loosely translated ""You can't tell"" plastic surgery clinic with many ladies walking around in their yoga wear with bandages all over their faces. I thought I would hate Myeongdong because I hate shopping but it was highly entertaining place. May be I am just weird but I would just go there again for the street food and people watching."

In the middle of shopping flea, you may take a break to have tea in between the desert shops such as famous green tea indulgence Osulloc.

4782,4.0,"Myeongdong is a very busy area with lots of street stalls and store fronts to see. If you like shopping, this is a place to visit. Keep in mind that not everything is a good deal. It is always very busy with lots of people. Kind of nice that it is closed off to cars. The streets all start to look the same after a while.

4786,5.0,"Based on my title, Myeongdong should be a place to avoid at all costs while in Seoul. To the contrary, you should visit. The whole area is an interesting place to watch people, take photographs or (sigh) shop. There are plenty of places to eat and the area is in central Seoul."
4787,4.0,"Awesome food choices and so much shopping. If you're looking for anything beauty related, you will find dozens of shops here handing out freebies to get you to come in.

4793,5.0,Myeongdong is a very touristy place and that's the beauty of it. Love the lively night life with all the xiao che around the area. Shoppings are great too if you can find those little alleys where clothes are slightly cheaper than the main streets.  I love the restaurants around there too where they offer plenty of local food. Both day time and night time are worth a visit as they give different feel!
4794,4.0,"It is quite easy to reach Myeong-Dong since many tourist buy souvenirs in this area. So many choices available, and sold with reasonable price."

4801,4.0,"I spent about an hour here and thoroughly enjoyed the hype and the buzz. It was late afternoon and I had a dinner reservation, so I could not stay longer. I think one should allow 3 hours or more to see this place properly and shop. I did not buy anything since I did not have sufficient time. The place was packed with lots of foreigners as well as locals. I'm not so sure of prices as I did not inquire about anything. I read about this place on the Korean tourism website and a Korean business acquaintance took me there. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there."
4802,5.0,"Do you love shopping? Then you are in for a lifetime of fun in the Myengdong street market, visit it at night and you can get almost everything you want to buy. Also note that you can get some discount cards in the City Pass + transport cards that you buy, so do not throw the instructional paper in it away"
4803,3.0,"Personally, not into shopping whatsoever. I often wonder why folks would buy stuffs from overseas and drag the goods all the way back home. Very unfriendly to the environment and leave a high carbon trail behind.  Personally, I don't think the shops in the area are interesting. It's just a bunch of shops. What was interesting was the crowd. Especially all the male with 10 bags in their hands who were ""forced"" to wait outside of the stores while their girlfriends/wives/daughters/mothers went shopping. None of them seem thrilled to be in that area.  Take a closer look next time you are in the area.  The restaurants mainly catered to tourists and pretty much offered the same type of food. I don't think the quality of the food would deviate too much from one joint to the next.  If you really like shopping, by all means, this place is a heaven on earth. If you are ""forced"" to go shopping in the area, find a good place for people watching."
4804,4.0,"Myeongdong is hectic on the weekend but love the atmosphere of shopping here. The cosmetic stores offer many cheap price with good quality. and there's a subway department store that we must visit, Located infront of the Myeondong area after IBIS Hotel."

4807,3.0,"It was pleasant strolling Myeongdong on Sunday; however, after 1pm, the pushcarts (mainly selling food) start to set up and the crowd starts to swell so it becomes congested which adds to the hype of the place. Try the Milky Bee rose ice cream gelato - it's good !"
4808,1.0,"When we walked distance to Chungmuro for going to airport back to home country. Someone with ""airport taxi"" van, asked us many times and bit compel to ride in. We ignored beacuse it would be expensive than train, but he asked the price was same. And many times ensured us that no problem with price. But, it was cheating, he asked big rate for our transport when arrived in Incheon. So be careful, even you are in the developed country."
4809,3.0,"When I first travel to Seoul 11 years ago, Myeongdong is definitely my favourite. Time passed, and from my last trip there, I found it too crowded and mostly filled with cosmetic stores. You can found 2-3 same cosmetic brand store, on the same row, and repeated on the next row."

4812,4.0,"Myeongdong may very well be Oz to shoppers looking for good quality bargains in all shapes and sizes. Our condo-tel was strategically located in Chungmuro, a mere 10 minute walk and our baptism to this popular shopping capital happened last week as we entered via the Myeongdong Cathedral on top of the main artery. Coincidentally, there are branches of Citibank and Standard Chartered flanking the entrance as if suggesting we pray first, withdraw Korean Wons next, then shop away. The whole place is organized frenzy. There are hundreds upon hundreds of shops lined up along the big maze. Skin care giants like Nature Company, Skin Food, Face Shop, Innis Free, etc, etc cannot be missed. Like convenience stores, they are everywhere - inviting shoppers to come visit their shop with a promise of big discounts, freebies and no pressure to buy (a promise kept, by the way). Fashion retailers also hold their own in the area: Zara and H&M attract everyone to their mega-stores with the latest in urban fashion. Street food dominate the center aisles with popular Koren treats, from savory to sweet enough to satisfy the hungry shopper. During our 5-day vacation, we were here everyday either for a meal or to go full shopping throttle. Our last hour was literally spent here with last minute shopping for last minute requests from home. Something we didn't mind. Wear comfortable shoes, come armed with big shopping bags, open your palate to good food and (try) to stick to an identified shopping budget...then enjoy!"

4822,4.0,"If you are looking for all the available cosmetic stalls in Korea all at the same place, you have to visit Myeongdong. They have a variety of the famous Korean food like Korean fried chicken, BBQ, the rows of street food, and Sulbing. You definitely won't go hungry here, but the rest of the stalls selling clothes are slightly more expensive than the shops at Dongdaemun."
4823,3.0,"Well I have to put out there that I am indeed a guy and that you're getting this from a 6'1"" 30 something white guy who likes to shop, but usually name brand like items. My size is nearly impossible to find in any new or ""cool"" fashion... they just don't really make 'em to fit our larger frames over here, shoe's, no way, pants... you gotta be joking haha. Some 2-3XL can usually fit me if I'm lucky enough to find it? Socks are pretty cool here, but you can get that anywhere in korea. Purses or other knock-off materials, yeah sure, they have it, but you just as well to get it in any other shopping district. I'm not a real big fan of large crowds and the occasional aujeema elbowing me in the ribs as she passes me along the sidewalks that are overcrowded and packed. There are several cool places to eat along the way and the food is usually pretty good and priced low enough to not really get upset over the bill come time for the check. Parking... haha, don't make me laugh. Good luck with that one. If you're looking to do some bulk Christmas shopping ahead of the holiday maybe it is worth it... but for me, I just don't think its worth the aggregation."
4824,4.0,"Always crowded at night, a lot of street foods, cafes and restaurants in this area. Best place to shop for cosmetics as you can find any brands there with more than 1 outlet for each brands (e.g. Banila co., Innisfree, Nature Republic, Etude House, Olive Young etc.). Though it's indeed a shopping paradise for tourists, tourists who can't speak in korean may be treated impolitely sometimes."
4825,4.0,"Shopaholics paradise! Great for skin products and cosmetics. We spent a bit over 2 weeks in Seoul and must say we spent most of our cash here! Plenty of shops to choose from, where it be skin products cosmetics, clothes or shoes. Must do on your list if visiting Seoul!"
4826,5.0,"The place to shop for cosmetics!!! And to try FREE hanbok in Seoul Global Cultural Center located in M Plaza (you have to take the picture yourself, but you can always work together with other travelers to take turn taking pictures :D)"
4827,3.0,Great shopping for facial products and apparels! Street food are good too. But will get a bit lost as there are many lanes within the area which will get disorientate. There are many repeated stores within the entire area too. You will get to see similar shops every few hundred metres.
4828,5.0,"The most popular shopping district in Seoul regardless of fashion, cosmetic, food, money changer, departmental stores, etc... We stay in Seoul 10 nights, we'd been there 4 nights! Because my hubby love to go there. If you want to go there, be prepared it is insanely packed with tourists and locals. If you plan to buy cosmetic products and if times permitted, shops few stores and compare the promos. Same brand may have different promos and always ask for samples! Small tips, you can check out some of the travel blogger site or Korea Travel site, they will have some discount coupons which have further 5% disc if you purchase exceed certain amount. The only disappointment or frustration, the Etude House that near H&M, they offer free cosmetic set to China tourist for purchase over a certain amount. I""m not China tourist but I can read Chinese. The sales ppl told me I'm not eligible for the free set because I'm not holding China Passport even if I bought over that amount. So, they only welcome China tourist and my spending in their country or in their shop is not valuable at all? What a shame ..."
4829,3.0,There are better markets in Seoul to explore... This one is quite average. If you don;t have much time in Seoul - Skip this one.
4830,4.0,"Myeongdong is one of the best shopping center in Seoul. You can find all item from make up, clothes, food and many more. Opening from 7.00 am this market is open until morning in a few place but mostly the stores closed at 12.00 pm. This place can reach from myeongdong station or euljiro 1 exit 5 or 6. The price could be negotiate if there is no proce tag. If you love shop this place is the place you must come."
4831,5.0,"A great place to have good Korean food, good bargain, good shopping! It's a big place so it will take a long walking!"
4832,5.0,"So muc to see and buy. Great for clothes, makeup and what ever your heart desires. The ""rose"" ice creams are superb."
4833,3.0,The shopping prices are very inconsistent you may see a similar item in a no name shop for ₩17000 next shop it would be ₩40000 and quality wasn't different. Good tourist place for shopping but many similar shops no matter where you go in south korea.
4834,5.0,"Visiting the streets in here is a unique experience. The place is lice and vivid with. A variety of stores, eateries and coffee shops. Neon signs and posts complete the feeling of Seoul. A must see"
4835,5.0,"Safe, clean area full of restaurants, street vendors, and stores (never seen so many ""facial product stores"" in one place). Great place to stay if you are a tourist or visiting Seoul for the first time. Close to subway lines/"
4836,4.0,a good place for bargain shopping/ night life/ food. a must for leisure travelers. Evenings are crowded and entertaining.
4837,5.0,"It is nuts how bumpin' this place is, especially during the Chinese National holiday. These shops all have individuals who speak Chinese and even special sales for the amount of Chinese tourists that come through there. It is so easy to get turned around and lost.  You can find a ton of knock of items; cosmetics; accessories and named brand clothing. I totally raided jeans at Forever 21 on sale, #teacherproblems only wish I had bought more...Street food around here is stellar as well but bloody expensive!"
4838,5.0,"A great place to shop! Many street food can be found there. One can also visit the Myeongdong Cathedral, which is really beautiful. Definitely a must-go!"
4839,5.0,"This is probably the best shopping area that I have ever been to. It is much better than West Nanjing Road in Shanghai. It just seems to have a great blend of the traditional Korean, mainly street food; and the modern. You can pretty much buy anything that you want. Just realize that there are a ton of people in a very tiny area, so if you don't like a lot of people, then this is not for you."
4840,5.0,loved this place. shopped almost 100 kind of facial masks and beauty products. very nice ambience and crowd
4841,5.0,"Lots of cosmetic stores available; shopping district. Better at afternoon till night since there will be more pop up stores available selling Korean street foods such as mung bean pancakes; fried squid; etc.  Korean cosmetics are far more cheaper than in our home country, and we've brought so many here since Korea is famous for its cosmetics products."
4842,5.0,"Hi  Just before I went shopping at myung dong, and dong daemun. There r lots of goods I want to buy ..clothes, cosmetics, souvenirs..etc.. It' pretty cool place.  But I became uncomfortable.. because of the mountain of shopping goods.  I just wondering if I can courier my luggage and box containing goods from my accomodation in Jong-no area to Incheon Airport ?  If so, what are the charges and How long does it take the time for delivery?  Thank you."
4843,4.0,This is the place that every tourist have to see. Many shopping places in this area. Atmosphere is great! Only minus was that it was little hard to find a bar and take a beer.
4844,4.0,Plentiful of cosmetics shops around this place. Most of the lady at the shops speaks good mandarin language and some can be very unfriendly and rude.... Not all shops gives free sample... must not forget to ask for some.
4845,5.0,Myeong-dong is one of Seoul’s main shopping district and it is filled with stores that line up the streets. The place comes to life when night falls and the brightly lit buildings look even more spectacular against the dark sky.
4846,4.0,"This district is a gathering of renowned international & local brands. Many shops offering merchandises of fashion goods, restaurants, nutritional supplements, cosmetics, accessories, etc..."
4847,2.0,Tourist trap ...no high end brands and totaly crowded..for teens and cheap shopping....spend a hour max and go to Lotte instead
4848,5.0,"Good food, shopping and home to the Nanta theater with an amazingly funny cooking show. Worth the adventure :D"
4849,4.0,"Must visit. Not to be missed if you are in Seoul. Even if not to buy anything, window-shopping is still fascinating."
4850,4.0,"I have a feeling this is one of those places which you will either love or dislike. If you love crowds of people jamming into every available space, in every nook and cranny shopping their wallets out - especially if it's cosmetics of every variety - then this is the place for you.  For me, I can't stand crowds, much less shopping with them, and as for cosmetics, I'm a guy and not one of those that would have any use for them.  However, what I do love about this place is exactly that. Standing in a vantage point, observing the maniacal and frenzied rush of hopeful consumers desiring to partake in a menu of elixirs and creams that promise them eternal youthfulness, was certainly a sight to behold.  Besides, there is so much more to see and experience ... the street food, fashion stores at every corner, and more food, and then some.  If you're ever in Seoul, and you don't willfully subject yourself to the collision of senses that is Myeongdong, you have truly missed the essence of Korean culture - one aspect of it at least."
4851,4.0,"We visit there 2 times, more busy night time, full of young vendors , skin care shops and restaurants, street grilled food, shops are open late night. Undeniably a place worth sit in the corner and checking beautiful things around you. Finally I find a good toilet, I went to SAVOY hotel."
4852,5.0,Yes this is the place where most of us will shop for all kinds of beauty products. All lot of stores are repeated. But not forget some good restaurants are located around that area.
4853,5.0,"Shopping, shopping, shopping galore! Great for pretty much anything when it comes to buying - a lot of people say it's good for buying the Korean beauty products, which it is but there is also much, much more! I would say that the street food is a good attraction too!"
4854,5.0,"So many cool little (and big) shops here in Myeongdong. It's a pretty busy shopping district, and the movie theater is pretty nice, but it gets crowded fast, so keep that in mind. Street and food vendors are littered everywhere - speaking of which, if you buy from a food vendor, you can hand the trash they gave you the food in back to them when you're done and they'll throw it away, which is good to know since it's often hard to find trash cans in Korea. Restaurants abound here, many of which are very western, but there are tons of Korean places too. You can buy quite a few cute things for 1.000 won each, so I was in love. :)"
4855,2.0,"The entire street is packed with tourists and street vendors that cater to foreigners and those looking for ""discounted"" cosmetics. It's overwhelming and loud with Kpop and dubstep blaring from the stores wherever you shop. It's not for faint of heart and honestly just not great, unless of course that is your thing. Products being sold are the same sort being sold throughout Asia and at the same prices.  If you do however visit, pass through the main ""myeongdong"" street, cross the stream to the opposite ""youth"" area which caters to locals and is a slightly less hectic and more pleasant, also offering up authentic street food.  Stores such as the Lotte Department store close rather early, so keep that in mind if you are intending to stop by."
4856,5.0,"The Myeongdong shopping area is heaven to fans of Korean cosmetics and skin care products. Here, you will find streets lined with the famous Korean cosmetic brands, such as Laneige, Nature Republic, TonyMoly, Skin Food, etc., where you can get really good deals. Also close by are excellent restaurants, like Gogung which is famous for its bibimbap.  At night, Myeongdong shopping area comes alive with street vendors setting up shop. The stores are open well into the night. This place was still hopping close to midnight. Definitely a place worth checking out if you visit Seoul."
4857,3.0,"Many Korean cosmetics to shop , but I was not Korean cosmetic FC, my friends did buy a lot, they're enjoy shopping there very much.They went twice. Very interesting that , Korean cosmetics , put snake venom, bee poison, snail extracts and many strange ingredients, the sealers were all very friendly.They would greet you with free sample when you bought something, very smart sale."
4858,5.0,"I totally love these streets! It has all kind of shopping (modern, Korean, American shopping etc.), food markets, restaurants and so on."
4859,5.0,lots and lots of cosmetics and facial products at very reasonable prices. many eateries and plenty of street food stalls. my friends and i spent more than half a day there.
4860,4.0,"Endless street s full of vendors , shops and restaurants . Many bargains to be had . Lots of entertaining shops and experiences , from live music , to street grilled food , to a cat petting cafe , to American authentic bars and food, to Korean fashion and face and body creams . Some high end stores also exist . Great place to go with family , nibbling and shopping and walking ."
4861,4.0,"Happening side for shopping especially korean cosmetic products. All type of facial mask, cream, losyen from tip of hair to toes. Cheap allovera gel and if lucky enough to collect free samples. Paradise shopping for teenage or those K - Pop fans. A bit high end shopping with moden style and lighting compare to near by Namdaemun street market."
4862,4.0,"My local hosts & I went to an early performance of the cooking Nanta show which entailed fighting through the traffic and shoppers to find the theatre and a similar experience afterwards when leaving.  Indeed we attempted a short shopping spree after the show in the Myeondong area, but this being a Friday evening the place was packed. If you want to see an orderly but still chaotic blend of street stalls, street food and high class department stores then this is the place to head for."
4863,5.0,"A lot of shops to buy from, many food shops also, you can find all what you are looking for, worth a visit."
4864,5.0,"A visit to Seoul will never be complete without visiting Myeongdong. Whether you are looking for beauty products, music, clothing or food, Myeondong is the right place to be at. Visiting this place on a late afternoon is good, but coming here at night is a lot better. Everything is bright in Myeongdong at night. Street foods are reasonably cheap and money exchange shops can be found everywhere."
4865,5.0,Great are to browse for cheap and mindless items. Weird food everywhere. People from all over the world.
4866,5.0,Super shopping for girls! My friends literally went berserk at all the shops available and all the sales!
4867,5.0,"Best shopping in Korea. Lots of street food and restaurants and cafes. There are often little concerts or interesting cultural activities going on there. Expect lots of crowds though, I'd recommend not going on a Saturday or Sunday if you can help it."
4868,4.0,"Go there for the street food not shopping. They sell skin care products for Chinese tourists. The food is varied and inexpensive. Sausages, seafood, meatballs. Visit during late afternoon or early evening."
4869,5.0,"Kind of like a mercantile Superman: mild mannered reporter in the day, super hero at night. Same for Myeong-dong: rather hum-drum during the day it just explodes at dark with all the spirit of Korea's incredible young people, wonderful street food, and frenetic shopping. None of the street merchants take credit cards so take plenty of Won to spread around so many delicacies in 1K to 3K increments which are invariably prepared and presented with flair."
4870,2.0,"Nice, but not cheap, you can find the same items in other areas for a fraction of the cost. You also have to make sure items are made in Korea, otherwise if items are from China quality are not as good."
4871,2.0,Said to be THE place to shop in Seoul but even on a sunday afternoon it was far too busy and we just shuffled from one end to the other. Was happy to go there and experience it but would rather shop in the markets (both above and under ground)
4872,4.0,"If you hate crowds, avoid this area on weekends like the plague. You'll see many Japanese and Chinese tourists everywhere trying different Korean snacks or shopping for cosmetics. I still enjoy it. It's a very fun place to see all kinds of unique people there and delicious street food which combine for a photo haven for professional photographers or wanna-be photographers like myself. If you're super adventurous you can go to N Seoul Tower during the day and come here at night. Just be aware of the peak times: Friday nights and Saturday nights."
4873,4.0,"Certainly a ""chicks"" area due to the stores and cosmetics. Worth a walk around just to experience it - certainly some interesting sights!"
4874,3.0,"Probably a fun place for tourists to shop but it is super crowded (especially at weekends). There are helpful tourist volunteers around the streets who can help you if you need to find something.In the open street areas there are wall to wall Korean cosmetic shops and each one has a pushy salesperson out front trying to get you in to the shop. Some even give you free samples just to go inside and look. There are also international clothing chain stores like Zara, Uniqlo, Forever 21 etc. The small side streets have plenty of coffee shops and small local restaurants. In the early evening many food stalls set up on the streets to make a night market. At the edges of the area there are big Lotte and Shinsegae Department stores as well as underground shopping malls. A chaotic, frenetic place to shop and If you like a peaceful shopping experience it is not the place to go. There are plenty of other places around Seoul that sell the same things."
4875,4.0,"If you like shopping then this place is for you. It's chaos, noise, food, shopping and more chaos. I loved the craziness and the food."
4876,4.0,"Pros: Good exchange rates Many street food Diverse stores/items for sale Clean and easily accessible  Cons: Sales people are nice when you enter the store but rude if you decide not to purchase especially at small boutiques  Not a lot of western restaurants  Overcrowded, Asian people do not know how to walk. They walk in a zig zag way and some refuses to move.  Don't offer a public restroom facility. I had to use where I was dining."
4877,5.0,"Love ir here! All the skin care you thought you ever wanted! I stock up on skin care every year I visit. There are also many clothes stores, cafes, restaurants and street vendors too! A good place to people watch."

4879,5.0,"favourite shopping place.too many things to shop,so much cosmetics and skin care product. a lot of things to buy."
4880,5.0,"A touristic area but prices are all reasonable. you can get cheap clothes at Milgiore, good Korean BBQ or other authentic cuisine in the streets, and the most famous cosmetic and skin care shopping of the country. Don't miss the street food too which will normally start their business after 5pm till 10pm."
4881,4.0,I bought very nice and modern shoes and had good lunches in the small restaurants in the streets. You can spend lots of time here
4882,5.0,"The Myeongdong has the feel of a market - everywhere there are people selling stuff in the street, you have the street kitchens but you also have stores with different brands Addidas, Nike etc it is a nice experience if you like a lot of people, noice, smells and kaos"
4883,5.0,"There are many food stall along the street. I love them so much. For me who didn't eat meat, still there are much for me to try. I love their ""screw like potatoes"", and I think you should try it too.  Best for shoppaholic. You can get shoes, clothes, cosmetic and many more at reasonable price.  It open until late night."
4884,3.0,"It's best to go in the afternoon when most stalls and food areas are open. But if you were shopping for younger and smaller styles, this place is not for you. I found that this place is more for bigger and older clientele. I didn't like the street food either. I think Bankok is much better on both fronts."
4885,5.0,"Lots of cosmetics and skincare products you can find, but may not be with the biggest discount. Lots of good local food too."
4886,4.0,"Has just about anything you could want! Lots of shops, street food, some great restaurants, cinemas."
4887,2.0,"very happening, fashion hand phone casing, cosmetic and more but price is way too high for a budget tourist."
4888,5.0,"You here about London, New York, Paris etc. They have nothing on this place!! I have never seen so many shops in my life!! There were shops within shops, shops on top of shops. It really is a shopping paradise!! Even if you don't like shopping there will be something here for you I guarantee.  My top tip is to go in the evening. The whole place lights up!!"
4889,5.0,"it is very nice place to shop mainly in the night. you can find mix of goods brands, food and Kiosk. although crowded but must visit place. Also lots of beauty products and cosmetics."
4890,5.0,"GREAT PLACE TO SHOP! We shopped in SPAO, H&M, Face shop. Buying for yourself and family is a treasure since the prices are low and there are great bargains. Since I have teen agers, they just shop on their own without me worrying on their safety coz there are areas with WIFI and we easily communicate. There is a coffee shop, Starbucks, which is a good place to stay while kids go around to shop as whiel we eat and drink coffee. Also once you stepped out , there are so many stalls to shop for small and big items you can take home as give aways. There are also sellers of street food that are clean and healthy. Our shopping escapade was fantastic!"

4893,4.0,"I love Myeongdong, too much that we went there almost every single day during our week's visit in Seoul. Every possible store that we were interested in we could find in Myeongdong.  The place welcomes you as you step right out of the Metro exit. There are merchandises such as souvenirs, clothes, bags, other accessories and a wide array of street foods displayed on the stalls lined up in the midde of the streets. They are not the cheapest around Seoul though, but the most convenient in my opinion.  One is not limited to the stalls on the streets, as there are quite a number of retail stores that are situated all across Myeongdong as well. You can even find good money changers in the area, and a tourist information office too. Definitely worth dropping by when in Seoul."
4894,3.0,"This place is busy and we came here twice during our trip to Korea. Full of eateries, street food, and shops especially cosmetics and skin care and I guess a must-see in Seoul. For a light shopper, I actually find the church and park nearby quite nice, and walked on the street further north to find the financial district a nice walk."
4895,4.0,"I really love myeongdong . So many item in here and food too. In this area have cat cafe too , no regret. Its awesome place"
4896,5.0,"Crazy! Hyper shopping is the word. Lots of women's fashions in particular and cosmetic shops by the score. A lot of emphasis on face masks, which possibly explains the beautiful complexion of Koren women."
4897,5.0,"It's messy, crowded, hectic and big. It's easy to get lost, but you'll find something to buy anyway. Everything is jist so darn cute or very convincing conterfit luxury bags. You can haggle, eat, drink or wander. Good luck finding parking or just cab it."
4898,5.0,Its the place that all Koreans and foreigners go to buy makeup and cosmetics especially masks. More than that you can find a lot of street food
4899,4.0,This is a market place with lots of local food taste. It is really crowded and it's more crowded at night. The lights and tall buildings will entertain you.
4900,5.0,"Get of the blue 5 line at Myeondong and exit number 6, turn left and go down the lane. You will find a multitude of shops in the lanes around the area. Explore inside some of the stores as they have shops inside on multiple levels. The place is hive of activity with people. Near the cathedral you will find stalls in the centre of the street selling all manner of goods, which at night time the stalls extend to over parts of the area. If you left at the theatre and cross Namdaemun-ro you will see Lotte town to your right. This is a giant department store the first four floors devoted to women's clothing alone. Worth the trip to see what Koreans are buying."
4901,5.0,"This place is filled with the modern culture that is everywhere in Korea. The food is great, can'r go wrong anywhere here. Yes there is plenty of shopping but people watching is my favorite!"
4902,4.0,"Definitely hustling and bustling! We found a noodle restaurant that was WONDERFUL and returned for a second meal. But, unlike other neon-lit districts in the world, this one actually goes to sleep relatively early, which surprised us."
4903,4.0,For all the girls out there; this is cosmetic laden district! Simply love the shopping arcade that display so many variates! It is a big open air shopping so take your time to stroll there!.
4904,5.0,"Very exciting shopping area, Korean mask sold here. Mask Price it's decent here, lots of vendor/street food here."
4905,2.0,"This place is too stuffy. Overcrowded with so many local Koreans and Chinese people. Also price is not that cheap. Actually, it is bit expensive than you might expect."
4906,2.0,Not my thing. Crowded noisy smelly and the same brand shops repeated over and over. Maybe more for the younger crowd.

4912,5.0,Easy access by subway Line 4 Myeongdong Station exit 8. Towards the end is subway Line 2 Eugiro-1(il)-ga. Many things to shop from fashion to cosmetics.

Visited SPAO for value for money young adult clothing WWW.SPAO.COM  A must eat place at Myeongdong Kyoja for steamed mandu (dumpling) and extremly spicy kimchi http://www.mdkj.co.kr/en/ Sometimes this place could be long queue but disbursed quickly.
4913,3.0,"The only 2 things brought me here were the Nanta show theater & the Cathedral. For shopping, you can go to many other less touristy places like Apgujeong, Insadong, Sinsadong"
4914,5.0,"At night, this is really something to see. In the middle of all the cosmetic stores, there are vendors selling everything from chunks of watermelon to BBQ to tempura."
4915,5.0,"Great of good foods , but pricing for the foods is not quite cheap . From bag to clothes to sock everywhere you can find here but is really tiring if you spend the whole day walking .  Korean Dessert Bar is around the area, The snowflake is a must try over in Seoul if you ever saw.  :)"
4916,5.0,"Great for shopping, especially if your looking for cosmetics & other beauty products. Most shops you walk by gave free samples for just walking in & there are plenty of repeat shops down the streets. I now have a collection of different styled beaty mask. If not their for beauty the market is also good for some clothe shopping & food stands."
4917,4.0,Best place we visited during our Seoul trip. Great shopping and tasty street food. Lots of delicious restaurants too.
4918,4.0,"This is like the place to be unless shopping is never on your list. Needless to say, fashion outlets, cosmetics, food from western to traditional, hotel stay are all lumped into this area. Bring enough cash and if you ran out, no worries since money changers are plentiful. Look out for the traditional kyoja that is close to 50 years."
4919,5.0,"Compare to other similar places in other cities, MyeongDong vibes differently.  Street food and shops like no others, varieties and culturally fun.  We spent 3-4 hours just strolling the shops, and try bits of street food.  Do try when you are in Seoul.. it won't be a disappointment.."
4920,5.0,Cool streets with funky stuff and affordable prices! I even purchased more clothes and really enjoy the moment!

4924,4.0,"literally. The place is a paradise for those who love to shop. It can also get very crowdy, so if you want to avoid the big crowds go before 4 pm or so but if you go later, you will get the streetfood."
4925,4.0,"Myeongdong is the neatest little area. The beauty brands have multiple locations in this location, so its easy to get turned around...but thank goodness for smartphones and gps!  On our very first day in Seoul, my friend and I got dropped off in the morning. I highly recommend starting out here early if you want to avoid crowds! If you are into beauty products, this is your mecca!!! If you give a crack wh*re some crack, she's probably gonna go a bit crazy. I could have easily swept everything off the shelves and into my basket I was so excited! !  Sure they sell clothes and souvenirs there too...there's things for guys there. Also there's some decent restaurants if you get hungry while you shop.  If you happen to find yourself in myeongdong in the evening..like after 5pm, the street food carts come out, and it becomes a completely different experience!  If you're still not done shopping, head to the edge of myeongdong and go down into the subway entrance, you'll be met with a giant underground mall that connects you all the way to city station! Bags, clothes, shoes, souvenirs and snacks can all be found down there, away from the sun and the heat!  Have fun!"
4926,5.0,"Whatever your heart's desire, you can find it in Myeongdong. There are lots of clothing shops, cosmetic shops, restaurants, and cafes for when you get tired or need to refuel.  I'd say it's more for girly-girls with cosmetic shops, but when when they're handing out samples it's fun even for tomboys!  Easy to get to on public transportation (subway)."
4927,5.0,"Great shopping area and especially for foodie at night with a lot of street food karts and seaoul is known for street eats, it is kind of a tourist trap, walk a bit around and you'll find some proper korean street food. however, its a must visit"

4929,3.0,"We stayed in J Hill hotel which was in the right center of Myeongdong so we were able to see activities from morning till night. The streets become a huge night market in by 4pm, and are opened till 9pm - you are expected to bargain for the items. the shops themselves were never ending, repetitive outlets of the same brand.. every street will have an innisfree, missha etc .. there is only so much cosmetics and skincare one can buy, so i would rate myeongdong good for one day's shopping at most. if you are of a bigger size, forget about buying clothes here as their biggest size is a UK 10 in most shops."
4930,5.0,This one is especially for the girls. Seouls shopping district has something for teens right up to moms and afterwards you can relax in one of the coffee shops while dad and the boys catch a movie. Easy to get to and lots of great places to eat.

4934,4.0,"I have dubbed this place ""Skincare Heaven."" I took my sisters here when they visited from the States because I had read articles that this was the place to get free skincare and makeup samples. The articles suggested bringing an empty bag because you'd get so many just by walking through the stores.  Well, those articles must be outdated. We got free sample but only after we purchased things. I guess I could have asked for free samples but I didn't feel right doing so if I wasn't going to buy anything. Nevertheless it was still something fun to do because there were so many skincare shops and each offer their own signature products."
4935,5.0,Good for Shopping and Eating. spent all day here. good quality in the reasonable price. can ask the gift from the cosmetic shops.

4938,4.0,"We were here during a torrential rainstorm and the MERS epidemic, and it was still pretty crowded - I can only imagine what this place is like on a typical sunny weekend! That said, it's a fun place to window (or actual) shop. My teenaged daughters really enjoyed buying adorable animal face masks and other cosmetic supplies while the rest of us loved the pearl tea, shaved snow, and other snacks we bought. It's a great place for people watching, since everyone there (even more than in the rest of Seoul) is young, fashionable, and ridiculously attractive."

4941,3.0,"Myeongdong shopping district, lovely, lively and clean! So many Etude House and Nature Republic stores I lost count. I guess the trip here would be more enjoyable if you didn't mind being dragged into stores by very friendly Koreans. Believe me, we told them no, but a few instances saw us having to pry our arms from their hands! Plenty of places to eat though, and not too pricey I thought. Definitely a not-so-thrifty shopper's paradise!  Honestly, if you're looking for cheap, visit the Myeongdong underground shopping centre! No grabbing, just cheapness!"
4942,4.0,"Myeongdong has a lot of different clothing and cosmetics shops- basically all the kinds of cosmetics and young clothing shops in Korea you can find here! At times it's too busy, so it's best to go earlier at 10am to get some shopping done. If you like it busy then head there in the early evening."
4943,4.0,"It definitely is alive with personality. Lots of music and people out on the streets trying to convince you to buy stuff. Rare couple people selling ""massages"" which seemed out of place. We didn't buy anything but did have lunch in the area, from which there are multiple good options. Another area to walk through but not a must see."

4946,5.0,"This place is crazy! Seoul is known for great shopping, especially Myeongdong, but what they are most famous for is their cosmetics. When in Myeongdong, buy. It helps to have a Korean friend guiding you, especially if you are not familiar with cosmetics.  If you don't, or you don't want to buy anything, it is still a great place to walk around at night, get some street snacks, and people watch."
4947,3.0,"You can find here almost everything, from local stores to international brands. Very crowded, and prices are not that attractive."

We didn't know of such a place until one day while walking through the streets we looked up and there it is!! It is near to the stores selling accessories. There are several food vendors along the streets selling authentic Korean snacks!! Also, we tried the restaurants along the streets which has Ginseng Chicken Soup, Dumpling soup and Seafood pancake!! Must try!! There Is also a Diaso store at one corner of the street selling pretty much Korean utensils. For those like us who want to buy gifts back for friends, there are many varieties to choose from. Do not have to worry for the restrooms. You can find them in those mini shopping malls or Starbucks or GongCha caffe, usually on the 2nd floor. Myeong Dong is also at the foothill of Seoul Tower. Do catch a visit there if you are at Myeong Dong."
4950,4.0,"This district is a super place for shopping cosmetics but you can find a lot of other shopping and restaurant in Myeongdong. Nice to go around for shopping and to see turist and korean people here. Very fanatics of beauty here, and it can be crowded at night but thats the fun of it."

4953,5.0,"I recommend that you download a map of Myeongdong Shopping District or find a Tourist Information Area (the one I saw was in front of Myeongdong Theater) when you arrive at Myeongdong and ask for a Map before shopping.

4955,4.0,"Shopping areas are always great places to check out the local vibe, be it in fashion or food. Myeongdong offers streets lined with fashion shops, in which you can buy anything from Gucci to Adidas, usually at 'sale' prices. Whether these really are bargains, you have to decide by shopping around, but if you can't find what you're looking for in one shop you're sure to find it just a little way down the street. Add in the vast array of food stalls set up in the street, where you can get a cup full of fresh fruit in summer, or a hot dish of teokpokki in winter. Vendors will adorn their stalls with all kinds of 'come-hither' decorations and lights, and back it up with interesting takes on street food - witness the pancake stuffed with nutella, banana, salad and honey-butter squid... So, if you're after clothes, decor or food, Myeongdong is almost sure to have it."
4956,5.0,"Get to Myeongdong Cathedral as the sun sets and watch the magic. Great shopping especially for young adults.

We cruised through Lotte Duty Free store - especially the cosmetics/skincare floor. It was jammed pack full of tourists, especially Chinese tourists from China! They knew a good deal! They were queued at the most popular Korean brands, Amore Pacific and Sulwhasoo. The Shinsegae department store is a fun place to walk through, reminds me of a Neiman or Saks. The real must see in the Myeongdong is Lotte Duty free cosmetics/skincare floor and all the skincare stores lining the streets! We can't forget the cute clothing stores either!  We also had some awesome street food and restaurant meals."

4967,3.0,"It was alright-if you are spending more than a few days/weeks in Korea, it might be worth the stop just for the street food. Otherwise, it's just a bunch of shopping. I prefer to do more off-the-beaten-path, historical type things on my visits to foreign countries, but that doesn't mean that Myeongdong isn't for you! If you want to stop by, take the subway and only spend an hour here for lunch/dinner/snack, and make sure to go on a weekend or later in the afternoon/night to really experience the street food."

4974,4.0,"This is one of the most bustling places in Seoul - but it has a one mode theme: shops, shops, and shops ... from bargain street vendors to main stream retail. If this is your thing then you are going to have lots of fun. Personally, I found it a little overpowering after a while.

Covering several city blocks and tucked just behind a main road the district cannot be seen while driving. It is like a diamond in the ruff, a secret garden. If you enjoy shopping, this spot is for you. After dark is truly when the magic happens with blindingly bright lights and people flooding the narrow streets and inside shops. There are a plethora of beauty supply stores in the area and they hand out free facial rejuvenating masks to compete with one another. There are several places to relax in air conditioned spaces and restaurants galore. However, the food vendors in the streets are the best tastes of the area."

A lot of stores (local and famous retail brands) , but I would really suggest to buy Korean brand specially clothes!!! They are so cheap plus the fact that they are also trendy. You will see a lot of Cosmetic shop in every corner .  When you go to Myeongdong make sure that you prepare your feet to long walks , bring a huge bag to keep the items you shopped .

You’ll find your discount street vendors and luxury brands all in the same district. Plan to stick together because you will get lost. There’s no “I’m standing right near The Face Shoppe” because everywhere you turn there’s the same shop. There are different stores for different taste. Here is where you can get all the top Korean beauty care products you can dream of. Trust me, I loaded up. You can never look too young! Oh, and beware of the cute elderly Asian woman offering massages – she’ll kick you if you say no and then pat your shoulder to play it off -- and yes, it kind of hurt."
5007,4.0,Shopping but mainly Korean brand cosmetics which are cheaper than back home and with a greater range of products. All sales assistants speaks Mandarin to cater to the mainland chinese shoppers. Lots of places to snack and there wil be some street foods at night.
5008,2.0,This one turned out to be the only disappointment during our Seoul visit.... much hyped but just as expensive and just like any other shopping area in Seoul
5009,5.0,best place for shopping. get your cosmetic product for a cheap price. Free gift for purchase above $50. Get the face mask 20 pieces for $10. Best place to go. dont forget the sulbing cafe korwan dessert cafe. Check it out...

5015,4.0,"Endless rows of cosmetic shopping where the shop assistants would throw in free samples when purchasing items. However, for every cosmetic brand, there are identical shops in the area (e.g., there were a couple of 'Nature Republic' shops within that area).  The street food along Myeongdong offers affordable quick bites to take a break away from shopping."
5016,4.0,"I am not a fan of shopping in my travels but if you like it, you should go there to find brands and shops all around. You can also try BIBIMBAP (Korean style rice), hot fresh juices, street food, teahouses, which are more Korean. Enjoy!"
5017,4.0,"As another reviewer said, there are a ton of Korean cosmetic shops here! I saw probably 2 or 3 shops for each brand, and I think they outnumbered all the other kinds of shops combined. So, if you're looking to stock up on some fantastic Korea beauty products for half of what they would cost to order them online, this is the place for you! They also lure you into the stores with free samples, although you don't have to buy anything. There are other kinds of shops if you want to take a look around, but nothing special. Mostly over-priced clothes and souvenir shops. My boyfriend did get a very amusing hat here though...."

5022,4.0,"There was really good shopping here. Once in the stores they are nice and clean, but the staff not super friendly. It reminded me a lot of NYC... a little dirty on the streets at night and loud with shop workers trying to hand you flyers all the time. What was fun was all the street vendors with interesting foods available. Plus where else can you go and hear K Pop playing? We went to some good K pop stores for my daughter. So many skin care stores. Lots of food places, we ate a local places. A neat Cat Café we wanted to try but didn't have time for. A McDonalds there sells sandwiches with shrimp :) We stopped at a French pastry shop most days. Very inexpensive (less than $2) and very good. Really crowded with tourists, but go off a few streets to get away from it. Really close to the stream which is especially pretty at dusk. I found S. K. really affordable."

Once you reach Myeongdong, don't missed the ""egg cake"", the taste is a little bit unique yet tasty. beside that, don't forget ""Odeng"", skewer fish cake with spicy soup, and there is many more street food you could try in Myeongdong.  since this place so huge, one day will never be enough to exploring this shopping area."
5026,5.0,"Big, clean, lots of shops to shop around. Lots of choices, Really liked it. Don't know what else to say. It really worth a stop."
5027,5.0,or you will find too much to buy! great viewing and interesting crowds make even a non-buying trip worth the time
5028,5.0,"Apart from the huge variety of shops selling all kinds of stuff, if you are catholic, you should visit the Myeondong Cathedral at the end of the street. We were there on a Saturday and there were 4 weddings going on one after the other, so it was clockwork precision with the choir going as well. What was fascinating was the little booths in the courtyard for guests for each wedding group to put in their gifts. Everyone queued so quietly. It was also very nice to see the mix of traditional grand Korean dressing amidst the modern attire of the guests. At the end of the mass, the wedded couple would bow to each side of the pew to thank the guests."
5029,3.0,"Foreigner who cant verse in Korean, and need enquiry, look for person wearing red shirt and red hats with red ""apron"" filled with maps, they can speak mandarin and english. I personally like crowded place but not this one. The salesperson from those shops are just way to hardsell. Due to massive foreigner came here to restock cosmetic, most of them learn foreign language too, especially mandarin. My friend and I was just asking for the price and decided to buy 2 or 4 pieces of mask, in the end we got pulled by one of the salesperson roaming all over the store, introduce this and that, asking to buy this and that. The things is not pricey but they packed in bulk, and we are not in financially position to buy bulks items. Therefore, I would recommend, for young traveller, or low budget traveller like me, try to refrain from their sweet talk, or their hardsell tactic. Just walk off. Nothing to lose then. If you want to buy cosmetic from those ""famous store"", just go lotte mart in seoul station, you can get a piece of mind. (Tips: those shop in myeongdong told me promotion item cannot tax refund, but the same shop lotte mart, they offer tax refund no matter it's promotional item or not, and the branch is lotte mart offer better promotion)"
5030,3.0,"This a place that you can find all the things, but mostly some gaget, with good price, for eletronic consumers this is paradise :)"
5031,4.0,"Most of my classmates (especially girls) were looking forward to come to this place. Its a mix of modern malls and street market. Very good food on the streets which is a must try. For shopping, u can just go literally anywhere since u are surrounded by it. Just take a walk, shop for things, dont buy at first sight, compare prices all around. We came at night and my classmates ask our teachers to extend staying at there for 2hours."
5032,4.0,"A very large night street market that sell variety of products like food, fruit, textile, souvenirs etc. a very big place that you may not cover every corner of the market. If you see anything that you like, just grab it coz you won't be able to return to that place anymore."
5033,4.0,"If you love shopping this place will be your paradise. Full of shops and kiosks where you can enjoy street food, ice cream and lunch & dinner."
5034,5.0,"Myeongdong is a heaven for those who love shopping, Korean food, nice cafes, and it's the perfect place for solo travelers to walk around/or to just stand in one corner to absorb the experience of being there. I was there for more than 3 hours, spent one hour in a cafe having a cup of coffee as I wrote postcards for my friends.  Everyone from everywhere was there. Shopping/window-shopping for skincare products, socks, caps, every must-have things from South Korea. The best of Seoul's street food were there, from the yummy grilled octopus on skewers, tteokbokkis, to the dragon beard candy.  You can either get on a subway/taxi/bus to get to Myeongdong or walk to it if you're not that far away. I walked for 15-20 minutes from Cheonggyecheon Stream, navigated my way without a map since it wasn't necessary, The signage to Myeongdong everywhere were clear.  I'd come here again to sit at a cafe and admire the alive-and-kicking Myeongdong."
5035,5.0,"Great place to check out and stock on cosmetics and skin care products. Many brands have multiple outlets most of which are a stone's throw away from each other. By evening time, many street carts are set up selling clothes, accessories and also food and drinks."
5036,3.0,"While other areas such as Honde and Garosu are more charming and relaxing, Myeongdong is fascinating, with its bustling mix of large dept stores and street shops. It is very touristic (esp. Chinese tourists) but with flavors of real Korea. Particularly enjoyable are the street food stalls."
5037,5.0,"Had our conference in Incheon and made a quick trip to Myeongdong. We love the street food here and shopping for Korean brand make up, face powder, lipsticks, eyeliner, mascara, BB creams cheaper by 3 or by 6. Oh we love the fresh strawberry here.. Don't miss it!"
5038,5.0,"Our hotel was located at Myeongdong, and the street is really lively at night. Although it is open longer on weekends than weekdays. The streets offer a different array of street food, souvenirs, socks, clothes etc. It was the best place to get cheap souvenirs and eat authentic Korean street food. Be careful of pickpockets though as they frequent the street."
5039,4.0,We stayed at the Ibis in Myeongdong and we were really pleased with the location. The street food there was awesome and clean and we tried many of the local snacks. Very yum! There are just an abundance of face mask shops on every street corner! A place to go if you are into Korean beauty products. Staff in shops don't speak much English but can speak basic Mandarin.  A definite must go!
5040,4.0,"If you're here in Seoul for shopping, then this place is a must go, especially for young ladies. Korean fashion and cosmetics are now very popular in Asia and this is probably one of the best places to buy especially cosmetics like masks and facial cleaners. There are several well known shops, I would recommend Nature Republic which now has several branches abroad. There are also many restaurants serving Korean food, not expensive. Some restaurants give you a choice of removing your shoes and sit on a mat instead of a chair. I would recommend Westerners to opt for table and chairs as they may not be used to sitting on mat for long, may have to stand up every 10 minutes or so. There are two mini supermarkets further away from the shopping centre in case you may like to purchase drinks and snacks."
5041,4.0,"Myeongdong is a bustling pedestrian shopping area. Attracts lots of Chinese and Japanese tourists -- in fact if you look Asian you may be spoken to in Chinese instead of Korean! Not a place to find traditional stuff; rather, Myeongdong is full of cosmetics stores and clothing shops. The place is definitely a maze so research in advance if there is a particular shop that you are looking for."
5042,4.0,"It is Korea's famous shopping area where the streets are lined with departmental stores and shops that sell branded cosmetics, clothing, bags and shoes. There are also many eateries and cafes. We also saw many money changers where one can exchange from one currency to another..the place is busy and crowded. The pinpoint of Myeongdong is to lookout for ZARA. Enjoy our shopping."
5043,4.0,Do get a map of the place so you can navigate your way through the maze. Stop by to grab a bite when you feel like it or treat yourself to a cup of coffee as you see the crowd goes by. You can easily spend 2 days here and still discover lots of new food/stalls selling unique and interesting stuff. Do note that it's not easy to find a pharmacy and even if you do most of them do not speak English. Some stalls do speak mandarin due to the influx of Chinese tourists from China.
5044,3.0,"This is a fun place to come see what it's all about. There are tons to shops and restaurants. However, all the shops are chains, so can be easily found in other areas throughout the city. If you are looking to do some actual shopping, this place will be very inconvenient due to all the other tourists."
5045,4.0,"Best place to get all the most popular cosmetics Korea is famous for, with low price (negotiable sometimes when you buy alot!) with lots of complimentary gifts. Really the best place to get last minute souvenirs for friends back at home :)"
5046,5.0,Main attraction? Face products & Cosmetics. Lots of eateries and fashion to spoil. Can pop by Noon Square shopping at the beginning of Myeongdong street. Bargain? Little. Good luck.
5047,4.0,"No credit cards in street shops or food spots, but great huge stores around, from H&M to local designer stores. price ranges for everyone :)"
5048,5.0,Very cheap cosmetics (w/ tax refund) with lots of freebies. There are also a lot of cafes where you can rest. (Try visiting one of the cat cafes!)
5049,4.0,worth a look around if you are a shoppaholic. some fab shops and bargains. The place is over crowded especially in the evenings but the atmosphere is fab.
5050,3.0,I enjoy shopping at the Myongdong street as compared to the Shopping mall. its 11 storey high but at the duty free area is full of tourist shopping local cosmetic.
5051,3.0,"like a mini tokyo (sorry, no offence intended, just my view), with loads of brightly lit stores selling skincare products and clothing aimed at the younger female/females generally. There were lots of food vendors on the street which made for an interesting viewing experience, though one vendor got mega-annoyed when i tried to take a photo of his stand. If a middle-aged male there aren't going to be many stores here for you, but still worth a walk around."
5052,4.0,"what else can I say? this is a paradise for shopping! cosmetics, fashion stuffs, foods, kpop stuffs, and many more. it's a bit too packed on weekend, though."
5053,4.0,"This place is where we can buy Korean clothing, cosmetics etc. It's nice to walk around and taste Korean food too. So many people from all over the world come here to shop."
5054,3.0,"in this sightseeing area, the thIng to buy is almost not reasonable but many lineup here.  Great speaker in Japanese and ChInese are so many."
5055,4.0,it was fun to look at all the venders and the food was great. Plenty of items to look at and purchase. Just a real fun experience.
5056,4.0,"Myeongdong is a shopper's Mecca, that's for sure. I'm a skincare junkie who's into unique and stylish clothing that you can't get anywhere else, so I had a blast here. Look out for clothing brands like SPAO, which strikes me as the Korean version of Topshop (but significantly cheaper), and Teenie Weenie, which has cutesy clothes (some of which are Teddy Bear-themed although a handful are pretty fashionable). Skincare brands like The Face Shop, Tony Moly, and Skinfood line the streets of Myeongdong, so you'll be utterly spoiled for choice.  The street food scene is also worth mentioning since you can get some good eats for a fraction of what you would pay at restaurants. The sausage skewers and the egg bread, which are priced at KRW3,000 and KRW2,000 respectively, are great if you want a cheap snack or dinner that's both filling and delectable."
5057,5.0,"- anything regarding cosmetics are available here. - latest trend in clothes and accessories, shoes etc. - easy to access via subway - fast food restaurants are easily accessible here such as Lotteria, McDonalds - Myeongdong is so much fun at night! many people visit here at this time, and many more street vendors selling foods and clothes available at nightime"
5058,4.0,"good for shopping, but expensive .. cloth and a lot of souvenir shop .. brand comes-tic there .. hope can go again .. cloth there very special and new for me .."
5059,5.0,"Lotte Department store has a duty free shop at the 9f, you can get the same cosmetics from popular Korean brands sold on the street shops at the 9f at duty free prices. But you can also get them at the duty free airport shops however, the choices are not as extensive as the ones at the 9f.... Don't forget to ask for a free item if you are buying in bulk!"
5060,4.0,Cosmetic and clothes paradise!!! Many cosmetic shops and the price is very reasonable. The clothes are of high quality and ladies will find this place a must visit place and even visit again.
5061,5.0,Its Heaven Street Shopping.. you'll find many many street food and many many street shopping but it cannot have more disc they give the fix price but i enjoy to walk and see alot of things and the most enjoy is the street food so enjoy your trip..
5062,4.0,"This place is definitely a ""must-go"" to women who wants to go shopping, whether cosmetics, clothes, shoes, etc. We saw shops with 1-3 branches within the area! If you get hungry, there are also a lot of food stalls on the streets and restaurants. There's definitely a lot of choices for you!"
5063,5.0,Free wi-fi at Uniqlo shop. Lots of street food to bite and fruit drinks Strawberry is fresh and soft and so sweet (I am not strawberry lover).
5064,5.0,"This is definitely for woman, heaveennn!go on Thursday, the make up store will give bigger discount. Also try some street food, though a bit pricey but it's wort to try. If you want to take home some korean snack, please go to the corner. Some store sell cheaper than the store located on the center."
5065,5.0,"My first stop in Seoul. I was so excited when I reached Myeongdong. I can see all the Korean makeup brand, restaurants, food stalls and etc. Best place ever!"
5066,4.0,"My fourth visit to Seoul and a short stop at this place of course, is a must. Most of the famous Korean cosmetics brands could be found here, some even have 3-4 shops scattered around this hectic area. Liptints, BB creams, CC creams, snail masks, ginseng masks, and so on are abundant at varied price range. So much fun just getting into the shops and see what new or amusing cosmetics products they got. Some of the salesperson here could be a bit aggressive but stand your ground and state clearly if you just wanna take a look around and they will (eventually) leave you to your own devices.  The street-food here was also delightful. So many choices and all looked yummy. And quite cheap too. It was also fun just watching how they prepare the food.  But this place could be absolutely chaotic and touristy, especially on weekends. Not the place to stroll leisurely and do some relaxed shopping. So many people swarming these look-alike alleyways. Very easy to get disoriented. Many of the stuff sold in the street stalls were cheap knockoffs. Fashion style here catered mostly for young adults and have petite sizes only. Thus for me, I only come for cosmetics window-shopping, street-food and to absorb some of the frenzied vibe of hyper-shopping."
5067,2.0,Too many people in one space. Advertising galore. Brand name peoples paradise but not for me. Noisy and competition.... I like to shop in peace thanks.
5068,5.0,"Myeongdong definitely became one of my favorite places in the world! Neon lights, shops and especially bargains! If I could, I'd sleep at the shops and never leave!"
5069,3.0,"Myeongdong is a popular shopping paradise. Most tourists came here to shop for souvenirs, clothings, shoes and skin care products. Lots of street food are sold here too."
5070,5.0,"Kept going back there to have a walk and shopping with friends. Very nice place to shop, especially for girls."
5071,5.0,it was so full of different stuff to buy. I was surprised that people trust so much that they just put their money on the table and continue selling their stuff . not worried if people will robbed them . I will go back again to this market
5072,5.0,Everything you need to shop for in one area. Very convenient. Everything from the luxurious Shinsegae to the street vendors.
5073,5.0,"Awesome shopping, everything from trendy high end items to local art and street vendors. Defiantly worth a visit"
5074,3.0,"Good if you like to shop for high-end luxury goods. Some nice malls. Not my thing though. I prefer the Naedamun market instead, but I generally like outdoor markets. Went during the day so perhaps it gets more crowded at night."
5075,5.0,"I LOVE Myeongdong. I've stayed in hotels in this region on both of my trips to South Korea and plan on doing so again when I return. As a Canadian living in China, my favourite shop here is Forever21, as well as Etude House (a Korean cosmetics brand). You can find both of these shops within close proximity of each other in other parts of the city (near the university, for example), but the energy and atmosphere of Myeongdong can't be beat."
5076,2.0,"I was at Myeongdong about 5 years ago and it was a pleasant experience. The sales assistant from the beauty shops were friendly and generous. This time, I find that not only some of the sales assistant were rude but also the service wasn't that great. The price is also higher for clothes etc.  If I'm going to buy any beauty products I would prefer going to other branches elsewhere (just fyi, there are ALOT of beauty products shops EVERYWHERE in SEOUL - Ewha, Hongdae, Insadong, Samcheongdong, Gangnam etc)."
5077,5.0,"Every night, so many people. Lots of young people and lots of police..very safe place to shop at night. Lots of food vendors...great food!"
5078,4.0,"You have to see Myeongdong. It is a crowded, frenzied shopping experience....big stores, small stores, street vendors, food vendors. Something for everyone. Fun, grea vibe."
5079,4.0,Nice place to roam around. During X'max time decoration is really good. You can get chip and midium rate cloths around the market.
5080,5.0,"Myeongdong is indeed a shopping haven, for girls especially. There are tonnes of cosmetic shops and outlets and all have some kind of offers going on at certain times. Oh, and some shops even have multiple branches in myeongdong alone. Skincare, mask, lotion, shampoo, anything you name it, they have it. For guys like me, besides enjoying the view of the girls shopping, I also like to go around the branded clothes stores like Uniqlo, Forever21, H&M etc. They usually have the latest collection for the season and with good pricing too. Of course they are a bit pricier than the likes of Namdaemun thrifty shops, but you get what you pay for. If you want to spend time shopping in Myeongdong, I suggest allocate a few hours at least, as the area is huge with lots of backalleys with more shops in them. Besides cosmetics and clothings, Myeongdong also offers lots of kinds of street foods, from tornado potatoes to 30cm long soft-icecream. Night time is the best time to spend here but be aware that the shops closes at 10pm so plan your time."
5081,4.0,Almost all skin care brands can be found here. Except Sulwashoo. The local Korea brands are all available here. The trick is to consolidate the items you want to buy and get a higher cap for tax refund in one shop. Go for the bigger shops so that they carry more range.
5082,4.0,"This is the best place for shopping and eating street foods. A little bit pricey though for souvenirs, I suggest insadong market instead if you will buy a lot. Definitely fun strolling this busy and lively place at night, we love spending our free time in this shopping haven."
5083,5.0,We loved the shopping area. It's easy to get there by metro or cab. Even the underground shopping possibilities are worth to see it.
5084,5.0,"The place is bustling with life! Every possible store you imagine is on this street. It's a clothes and cosmetics haven!!! The best part is the street food carts lined up in the middle of it all, and everyone of them is worth a try. Try the potato twists with sausage, it was really good!"
5085,5.0,I'm not that into shopping... what I liked about this place is the number of streetfood stalls along the streeeet!
5086,5.0,"You can buy almost everything here especially the cosmetics;)...Famous brand such as Zara,H&M,Adidas and MCM also has their boutique here."
5087,5.0,"This is definitely the place to shop in Seoul! There are a lot of shops and boutiques to choose from. There are also a lot of vendors selling delicious Korean street food! If you love shoe brands like Nike, Adidas, etc., try to visit LesMore! A lot of those brands are always on sale. A got a pair of Nike Air Max in that shop! I will go back and shop again in this place when I visit Seoul again."
5088,3.0,"I like the many choice of product offered. I don't like the price, If not careful,might be easily fooled by the seller's high pricing. Must be dare to bargain"
5089,5.0,"Very popular shopping area for stores and shops, not as many street vendors (except food). Very crowded on weekends and has great dining, theaters, etc."
5090,5.0,"Place is small but one will be spoilt for variety. Besides, the place is so lively. I enjoyed this place particularly for its street food"
5091,5.0,"Great place to shop and eat. For shopping, please check your receipt and amount before paying as one of the beauty shop charges me lots more. I was tooo happy shopping and forget to check.  Nevertheless, i will still come back again to shop and eat.  There are lots of beauty shops so take your time and pick. ^_^"
5092,4.0,"Our family just love Myeongdong. Particularly my wife and daughters. We also booked our hotel here.  This place is very different from other places we been to. There is so much buzz and 'live' in this place. This is a ladies's paradise for cosmetics, clothes, shoes, accessories, etc Food is abundant and varied.  The subway is located within Myeongdong with different exit points, and the airport bus limousine stops just outside on main road."
5093,3.0,"A must see if you're looking to get your shopping fix. Myeongdong features several streets full of shops, both international as well as Korean brands. Not every store is as cheap as you may expect, but there's plenty to choose from. Also, there are a lot of local food street vendors, so you can definitely try Korean street food. The place is quite tourist friendly. The only negative remark I have is that you have many stores you'll find more than one time just a street or two apart, so there overall number of individual stores is lower than what you may think. Avoid the underground shops as they typically sell the cheap stuff. But anything else is worth seeing."
5094,3.0,"Myeongdong is Seoul's best place for mod shopping and variety of eating.From Alaska to Tibet you can find shops and foods here if you have a will to walk in crowds for shopping - clothes, shoes,cosmetics, fashion accessories,coffee shops, cakes, fruits and juices, ice creams, jewelry, Ginseng,Music,Massage parlours, culture and Theater. 8 full streets to walk around,No cars allowed inside- well connected by subway Lines 1 and 4. American, English,Italian,Spanish ,Thai, Korean, Chinese, Indian, Tibetan & Vietnam food restaurants are plenty and you can select by your time and money. Discounts offers and gifts galore.Try your luck.OR PRAY AT NEARBY CATHEDRAL."
5095,4.0,"Fun place to walk around and eat. I'd say a must visit when you're in Seoul. Myungdong Kyoja is my favorite place to eat. Their dumplings and kalguksu are the best. You can also pick up good iphone (or other phone) cases, luggage tags, face masks, or any other accessories there. The best deal is if you want to get prescription glasses. There's a place across the street from the Lotte Department Store where you can get your glasses for <$100 (frames and prescription) and you get it the same day."
5096,4.0,"I find the place eclectic and very tourist friendly, as most stall operators have signals to indicate price."
5097,5.0,"Wow, want to find some place for shopping?. Cool place with many kind of cosmetic products. And you can find traditional Korea food here. I highly recommended this place."
5098,5.0,"Myeongdong is bustling in the evening. There are lots of beauty shops such as Missha, Nature Republic, Etude etc. Cosmetic products are definitely cheaper than in my country (Singapore). Bought two packs of 10s Missha BB Creams at SG$9 each (retailed at SG$20+ in Singapore). Cheap cheap cheap! And you're in for some free goodies too."
5099,4.0,"If you are looking for affordable/good quality Korean make up and creams, go here. All the streets are filled with tons of cosme shops for all the likes, even for men."
5100,5.0,"I travelled alone on a business trip. Went to meyong dong and these streets are amazing. Very crowded but i was the only western on the streets. Felt absolutely safe and at home. Many restaurants, both traditional and KFC/outback steakhouse. Many cosmetics shops, many food stands. Really enjoyable evening!"
5101,5.0,"Myeondong is always full of live and I'm still amazed by it even though this is my second time visiting after more than 7 years. Most of stores are cosmetics stores and the prices are quite competitive. Apparently, if you're buying brands like Laneige, the advise I got was to purchase the cosmetics here as they give you loads of samples and sometimes special discounts, but purchase the skincare range at the airport in order to get your tax refund. But either way, you'll be spoiled with choices at Myeondong, and be prepared to go nuts! There are of course the clothes stores as well, with some local brands to choose from.  And in between all this madness, you still get to try out the street food, shop for souvenirs or hop into one of their popular cafes at almost every corner! Quite obvious I'm a big fan of this shopping street. Will be back again for sure."
5102,5.0,"OK, this had got to be the most awesome place to be in Korea! I've read from others that is specifically for girls, ladies, women or i guess for the female gender. Not Really! There are lots of food outlets, restaurants, bars, also stores for teenage boys and a few for us men like suits. There is also an outlet where you can have yourself and your family in a traditional hanbok, and have your picture taken. The most spectacular transformation is when the sun sets. Ambulant vendors set up stalls and besides other apparels and souvenirs plus blankets, there are the street foods! Now these are delicious! They are definitely clean and hygienic, believe me. Koreans are very health conscious. The shrimp tempura is fresh. I know cuz i cook. And you guys should try the barbecued octopus! its tender. There is also the usual bibimbap (traditional korean rice with a mix of veggies, kimchi and chicken or beef or pork) I mean this place is awesome! The only time its quiet is around 6 am to 11 am. After that, the place is lively! For Shopper and foodies out there, When in Korea, you have got to go to Myeongdong!"
5103,3.0,"Recommended to all travelers to get skincare, cosmetic, toy, and foods here. Normally, this is the last stop if you follow tour agency. If you travel free and easy, better come and check here first before you compare other places."
5104,5.0,"All the latest trends in clothing, not the cheapest place for shopping but quality over quantity for sure.  Youll never be hungry or cold in this place....  This place is a must"
5105,5.0,"I love this part of the city. Always thick with crowds. Always fantastic street food. Always awesome shopping. Don't be offended that they don't want you to try the clothing on, they don't want the locals to either. Be sure to drop into Mr.PIzza while you're there."
5106,4.0,Most of the people would think about shopping here but not for me. After seeing a lot of choices for a street local food I suddenly change my mind from shopping here hahahaha. Besides I think it would be perfect for ladies here since they have a lot of cosmetics boutiques here a long the road. Plus the scarf is surprisingly cheap here you guys should give it a try.
5107,2.0,"My friends and I went to Myeongdong many times, and we got very bad experience there. We do like shopping and dining there, but somehow they'll show their temper / unfriendly attitude if you just buy little stuff or nothing to buy in the shop. Not only retail shops, but restaurants. So-called shopping paradise, just so so.  對於旅客來說，明洞係一個非常出名的購物地點！但係如果在店鋪只消費少少或者完全無消費，售貨員就立即黑面、發脾氣！這裡絕對稱不上係一個購物天堂！所謂的購物熱點就是這樣！"
5108,1.0,"Myeongdong is always jammed with people, always. You can go here just to see the crowd and do some people watching but after that don't do much. Shopping here is so uncomfortable but if you really want to try, go ahead."
5109,5.0,"Love myeong dong! It has so many options, from dining/lunch to shopping. We were there when they had massive sale, so we kinda go crazy in shopping. Lots of shops selling 1000won cute socks, love it! They also have lots of face care shops. In short, you can shop all you need in one place here. Totally love it and would definitely come to visit again."
5110,4.0,"Quite similar to Siam square area in Bangkok, it is full of cosmetic and brand name shops, food street and tourists. Food there are relatively expensive than in other shopping centers."
5111,4.0,At night it is crazy. Sooo many people and soo many freebies. You walk past a skin shop and you are given loads of free stuff. A woman could literally walk down the street twice and get enough free stuff to last you a few months. There are many cafes and restaurants etc and little food stalls. I would recommend going at night when it is lively and more fun ;)
5112,5.0,"many shops, restaurants and a few department stores in this area. basically you can shop from 10am till midnight. shop till you drop"
5113,4.0,"Myeongdong is famous and probably a must go place when you are in Seoul, it is filled with shops, snack vendors, small-big department stores and restaurants! When you are in Myeongdong, don't forget to look up, as sometimes the best coffee shops and where you can find a place to people watch or simply take a rest from the crowd are situated on the upper floors of buildings! Best place to find cute, unique things and girls, for all the cosmetic shops you can imagine! And if you are a fan of Korean music, there's a huge CD/music store at the main entrance of Myeongdong, there's enough posters and special packaged CDs to please everyone."
5114,5.0,"This shopping district is perfect if you want name brand clothing from popular stores {Zara, Uni Qlo, Top Ten Ten} around the world, Korean specific brands, and even local boutiques where you can bargain, which I'd highly recommend. Just make sure you put on your best poker face. Also, a great place to get street food though it will be overpriced."
5115,4.0,"If you're looking for cheap and interesting gifts for people back home, this is where you should go. Myeongdong is one of the places in Seoul that offers a night market. The scene is very lively with vendors selling socks, hats, scarves, street food of all colors, taste and levels of spicyness, amazing Korean make-up and skincare stuff, and so much more. The night we were there, the temperature was below freezing, so we ducked inside a Dunkin Donut store and ordered warm coffees and donuts to warm up our blue hands and faces. We went out again and shopped for silly stuffs after an hour or so. There's a lot of banks/ATM's in the area if you find yourself short of cash after haggling with stuff you never thought you'll need. Great place to people watch, enjoy the Seoul night market scene and score some cute socks, mostly for almost a dollar each."
5116,4.0,"A must see... the shopping crazy asian approach. From a European point of view: overpriced, and wondering what they do with those cosmetic patches applied to breasts and buts..."
5117,4.0,"If you are a shopaholic, this is a place you must visit, and must book a hotel at nearby,the shopping street mostly is skin product,foods , souvenir and clothes.

5119,4.0,"Myeongdong is always fun and lively. Unfortunately for some reason the shops are very repetitive. Walking around I must have found more than 5 Etude Houses, Face Shop, Skin Food, Art Box, and so on. It's like Groundhog Day!"
5120,4.0,We arrived just after lunch time and the pedestrian streets we manageable. But when we returned a few hours later the place had transformed. There were street stalls everywhere. Great place to spend more than a few hours
5121,3.0,"If you need clothes, to watch a movie, or many places to eat, it's got variety and good street food, but on weekends, good luck comfortably walking around. Masses walk as slowly as possible looking at their phones or starting blankly at store fronts. Street vendors sell socks and scarfs in the middle of the street blocking the paths. God forbid there is ever a fire. Thousands will be trampled to death with no room to move."
5122,5.0,"Vibrant, opens late at night, very family friendly. Lots to eat buy and see. Fun place to end the evening. Was staying at the fringe of Myeondong - everything very convenient."
5123,3.0,"Have you ever been to DTLA on a Sunday morning and gone knock-off brand shopping? That's what this is but with more people, more food options (which were actually good for the most part), and actual name brands! So, if you like walking through throngs of people vying to purchase the latest leggings and Cucci glasses, this is your place!"
5124,5.0,"An interesting place to taste Korea by sampling some snack food, including that delicious savory algae sheets and feel the strong commercial activity and shopping, and everybody offering you the most original things as well as common ones. Of course, don't hesitate for dribbling in each place"
5125,5.0,"Easily the highlight of my first ever Seoul trip. We walked around the maze of streets to cheerful hollers from perky sales ladies and bopping Kpop tunes blaring from shops, lugging our bursting shopping bags because you don't need to go anywhere else in Seoul for your cosmetics/skin care binge. Your favorite affordable/midrange brands are here and since they are ALL here, competition (read: freebies and sales) are fierce. Street food, clothing stalls, coffee shops, cafes and restos also abound. I can easily get lost here all day and never complain."
5126,4.0,I was there last year and I enjoyed a food there very much although the crowd might make you feel a bit dizzy but overall was so impressed!
5127,5.0,"Very nice place for shopper and don't get lose. I went there and take 2 days to finish whole place  Also, must go for bubble tea (Gongcha) ^&^"
5128,4.0,You could find as many as Korean cosmetic brands and feel the vibrant Seoul life in Myeong-Dong!
5129,4.0,Shopping haven for families especially teeners. A lot of food choices and great shows to watch.You can still do shopping at night here since shops close late at night.
5130,4.0,"This area is just plain fun. During the day it's alright. When the sun goes down, this place turns into an adventure and is where the 'hyper' title is earned. More street food vendors come out and the place is packed. There's tons of food options (aside from the street food - we pleasantly enjoyed the restaurant the 'Red Sun'). Wife had a blast window shopping, and got a killer deal on a awesome winter jacket and scarf. This being my wife's first time to Korea, she frequently used the expression ""Shopping in Korea is whole other experience"". Make sure you come here with plenty of Cash, an open mind, and empty stomach and try all the vendors, no matter how scary some of it looks."
5131,4.0,"Not a criticism, I'm a tourist. Full of Food stalls weekends and evenings. Shopping was 50 percent skin care stores. Lots of energy."
5132,3.0,For a moment I was very confused if I was indeed walking along the same street or not since most of the beauty / cometic shops brand name are the same. Too many repeats making this place rather boring for me. Was expecting more varieties.
5133,4.0,"It is indeed an interesint place, where you can see all kinds of people. Most of the things you can check out and maybe buy are average clothes and some souvenirs, which are quite nice and have a reasonable price. The place is full of coffee shops and restaurants, also street foods and snaks for all tastes. Ladies, prepare your money and venture yourself in cosmetics shops and guys...well..you will have to be very patient."
5134,4.0,"During my most recent visit, the place is flooded with tourist from all over the world. It is not very easy to get around as there were human everywhere. I only head down to Myeongdong because of my few favorite brands are there and the stock are always sufficient. Otherwise, I would seek other alternative."
5135,5.0,"My family and I visited this area in the early evening and I would definitely recommend a visit after 6pm. Then the street food stalls will be open and the streets fill up with locals (well, at least Koreans) and mostly Asian tourists. It is a nice neighborhood to go shopping and grab some food."
5136,4.0,"There were so many cosmetic stores selling facial masks that it was amazing to see all the different brands out there. My wife had a good time buying all sorts of cosmetics. Interestingly enough, Korean cosmetics are not as expensive as western counterparts."
5137,3.0,"The cab driver saying "" This place is packed with all tourists "" when I am about to get off. And he is absolutely right and I personally don't like it as I came from a city of shopping paradise."
5138,5.0,"My hotel is located in Myeong Dong, every day, we just go to shop and eat snacks there. Expectedly, the food was delicious and we can buy many souvenirs there. I bought some pairs of shoes, some clothes and some seaweed for souvenirs. It was very enjoyable. We also went to a barbecue restaurant there. It was very delicious. I hope I can go there again and can see those friendly people over there."
5139,5.0,"Tons of things about fashion are here.... cloths, shoes, cosmetics, accessories, restaurants, cafe, etc. Open around 10 am. But night time is better.... colorful and cheerful. Don't forget to bargain to get lower price."
5140,4.0,I have been to Myeongdong during the day but also after dark. During the day it are just the shops that are open. Which is perfect because it is not as busy although some people probably find it busy. Lots of different shops where you will be assisted by nice and helpful employees. At night there is a different world. It is super busy and you can barely move around other then getting back in line and move step by step. A lot of street shops appear which adds a nice charm. Can honestly say it felt like I was home in Amsterdam while walking around there.
5141,4.0,The whole complex alley full of energetic Korean teens life circle; Plenty of shopping goods items shops; cosmetic; Brand name logo. Along with local vendor food sell which of course some reasonable price some a bit overrate.
5142,4.0,"This is a must do every time I'm in Seoul. Masses of locals and tourists looking for bargains, shopping assistants thrusting samples into your hands and dragging you in add to the fun.

5143,5.0,"It's quite crowed, but I loved it! So many shops of all possible kinds and prices are okay."
5144,3.0,"There are a lot of Mainland tourists there buying a million mask sheets and other make-up products. The shop representatives look jaded and tired of their jobs; if you don't have to go there, don't go."
5145,4.0,Street after street of foods and a variety of goods. A place to visit when visiting Seoul. It reminded us of Mongkok Street and the Ladies Market in Hongkong. Definitely a must when you're in South Korea.
5146,5.0,"I visit this area pretty frequently just because I love the sights and sounds. It has everything! It's a huge place for cosmetics and facial care, but it also has the big Shinsegae department store within walking distance. I love Myeongdong!"
5147,5.0,"Myeongdong is a shopping paradise yet also a eating heaven with lots to do. There are lots of cosmetic shops, Korean boutique stores and well known brands such as h&m and Zara. You can spend a whole day there or even more. It is easy for you to get lost around the area but there a tourist information guides around to help direct you and give you maps. They are very helpful. Most of the people in the stores can speak English because it is a touristy area. Just make sure when you see an item you like -- buy it. It is difficult to find the same shop! They also set up markets around 4pm onwards which a lot of them sell food."
5148,4.0,"Like New York's Time Square, Myeongdong is very lively at night in view of the lighting of the tall buildings and lighted up billboards. There are a few street hawkers around offering bbq octopus and other stuff. The giant departmental store and the eateries give you plenty of choices 'what else to do'. You can also sit and watch people if it is not a very wintry nite.  As I have a limited budget I went down the underground shopping center and found a food court for cheap eats. Beside this there are also some fast food Korean eatery across the road (access under ground pass).  Maybe they can make a movie ""Sleepless in Myeongdong' without a need to hire cast of thousands of extra. Have fun eating and shopping !"
5149,5.0,"Myeongdong is home to many restaurants and stores, even O'Sulloc store from Jeju island is represented here.  Abundance of street food and stalls selling caps and facial products.  Money changers here do not offer good rates."

5151,5.0,"I went there on June, 2014. There are many cosmetic shops that went on sale!! love it. Must go!! Clothings and stationaries are also available. Across the road, there are Lotte mall and Shinsegae which have many brands, also supermarket that sold food"
5152,5.0,"I went down to Myeongdong with a colleague one evening while in Seoul. The shopping environment was certainly high-energy! There were skin-care shops and other shops galore, and the pedestrian-only walkways had many interesting kiosks down the middle, peddling anything from socks to street food. Good fun!"
5153,4.0,Streets of various products can be found in this super shoppibg street...all is needed is time and pkenty if walking. .cosmetics streets is craxy for ladies with pkenty of stores offering value masks at 1 for 1...plenty of eateries n coffee cafes as well. ..
5154,3.0,I am not usually the clothes shopping type. I usually look for unique things to by in markets. Myeongdong however was great for my wife who loves clothes. There are a lot of cosmetic shopping too.
5155,4.0,"Unless you are specifically looking for a particular brand or look, you will probably do better in the markets which will have cheaper stuff that are less commercialised."
5156,4.0,This has some incredible shopping! Lots of western stores and street vendors!!! I love buying cheap costume jewelry here. There is also some good street food.  But--it is crowded. Like sooooooooooo crowded. So come prepared.
5157,3.0,"It was still a great shopping district to visit in 2012. Many different shops and prices were attractive.  But nowadays, you can only find beauty shops everywhere in these crowded streets. And you can find same shop selling at same price in other area. Foods, might-be I was the unlucky one, it was disappointing.  If you are a first time visitor in Seoul, may-be it’s still worth to spend few hours in Myeong-dong. But if time is limited, I think Seoul has many more interesting places to see or shop."
5158,3.0,"Loads of shopping - not always at the best prices. If you have no time, this is the place to go, where you have loads of beauty shops, restaurants, etc. Some things are overpriced."
5159,5.0,So much shopping to do here. From high class luxury brands at the department stores to the fun and cheap shopping in the streets. Must go place for tourists.
5160,4.0,"I have been here a few times, and mostly just walked up and down the streets. The energy is unbelievable as there are many South Koreans and international visitors walking the crowded streets. There is a beautiful Catholic church nearby, so I recommend visiting that too. All in all, this is a place that any visitor to South Korea should visit."
5161,5.0,"Didn't think it would live up to the hype but it does. Fantastic street food, every ship imaginable and all restaurants accommodating to foreigners. I didn't think it would be like this but it was 10/10"
5162,4.0,"A place to be for lady like for me. I can get every cosmetics, beauty products that I wanted. From every Korean brand there is.  ask for sample products, but beware dont be swayed when they say its free. (check before paying, because I almost get cheated. They say its free but they almost charge me).  Bargain before buying...like bags and etc from the street vendor. Can get a good price when you know the trick."
5163,5.0,"The bags were brilliant for shoppers no matter which gender you are. Other than that, facial products will have to be wary since different outlets gives different promotions. some research first might be ideal"
5164,5.0,So many store and alot of people.. must come here you will confuse where and what to buy.. be prepare you wallet
5165,4.0,"When people say this is shopping heaven, they are not exaggerating. A small cluster of maybe four or five parallel streets are tightly packed with shops selling all sorts. This range from your usual brand names to independent stores. As expected, the big brand shops are largely the same as anywhere else in the world but my girlfriend took special pleasure with the independent shops. There were places selling anything from costume jewelry, cosmetics, bags and backpacks and anything else in the middle. The independent shops offer very decent prices and my girlfriend found that there was quite a lot of decent merchandise up for grabs. Even though I am not a big shopper, I also found there was some good selection for men's accessories as well.  The added bonus is that there are plenty of restaurants and cafes dotted throughout the area and we actually stopped for a couple of hours at one of the dog cafes (which name I can't remember, unfortunately) after desperately looking for a cat cafe. It turned out to be the best of the two dog cafes we visited during our short trip.  Probably best to go in the evening to get the full experience and to avoid most of the crowds. Makes for a good evening stroll and the shopping can be taken casually."
5166,3.0,it was too crowded and there are more Chinese than Korean. Street is filled with people and you have to squeeze in the shop. you better find out other place than MD for shopping
5167,4.0,"You probably heard of this place, and indeed there are so many streets of shopping and street food! Things here tend to be cheaper than Singapore (my country), and I LOVE THE STREET FOOD!!!"
5168,4.0,I like cosmetic a lot... So for me it's like a child goes to candy shop... Everything it's so cheap compare than they sell in my country. Soo it's a must visit for me if i go here again someday 😃😃
5169,5.0,"Its was really cold in winter therefore wear proper winter clothes especially young children. It does get crowded but being in asia its nothing surprising.  Moreover there are lots of variety such as designer brands, local brands and market like stalls. I would recommend a whole day to fully explore the place and the street food there is good and there are heaps of places to eat and have a cuppa. I would recommended anyone who would like to buy pressies to bring home stop by here also."
5170,5.0,Myeongdong has lots of shopping and for beauty products at least 3 or 4 of the same shops. If you head downward there are a tonne of restaruants serving all types of food. But there is nothing better than a good Korean BBQ.
5171,5.0,"Most shops have multi-lingual staff. They really cater to foreigners, and Chinese in particular. Makes it way too easy to spend lots! ☺ There is no end of choices for clothes, food and cosmetics in this area."
5172,4.0,"OK, this is mega-shopping so plan for having to wade through crowds. Myeongdong is one of the key shopping areas of Seoul - lots of tourists. Many shops and street vendors selling clothes, cosmetics and of course street food. Cosmetics seemed especially value-priced. There are tons of people at all times of the day, and our Korean friends warned us to be careful of flashing a lot of cash and to keep a close hand on wallets and purses. (Yes, even in Korea, petty theft occurs, especially in the tourist areas...) Parking can be HORRIBLE, so take a taxi or the subway if you can..."
5173,5.0,"A chance to savour lots of yummy street food whilst shopping along the alleys selling cosmetics, clothes, shoes, accessories and etc. You'll probably find all your favourite brands here. Also many eateries and dessert shops."

Definitely go here if you get the chance. prices are good and the streets are clean. (:
5175,4.0,"One of the reason for tourist to go to Korea must be to cm bug cosmetics, and this is the place: variety and price. Go and grab many facial mask while they last... The Chinese crowds buy by tons."
5176,3.0,better shopping at Shinjuku and Taipei or even singapore. with less pricey tags. Singapore also soeaks English.
5177,5.0,"Fantastic shops, easy to navigate and the variety of street food was insane. Loved every minute of it and can't wait to get back. If you get a chance to try the curly potato skin on a stick (with cheese powder) or the super waffles on a stick (they're bigger than your head!), do it!"
5178,5.0,"Myeongdong is a very busy shopping area and the main shopping stretch of Seoul for tourists. Most of the shops are selling clothes, cosmetics and street food though. There are tons of people at all times of the day, and we did find similar items at Ewha University for slightly less, so do consider that option if you are planning to go there anyway. At the same time, make some time to watch NANTA at the NANTA theatre in the middle of the Myeongdong shopping stretch."
5179,5.0,"In Myeongdong can you find anything for a good price. The South Koreans do really dress in a stylish way. They are all kind of good looking with very nice clothes. You can for sure find those clothes here, some fore only 10000 won (7 USD). This area is a big place so you will need to have plenty of time for your shopping. If you travel to Seoul and you want to buy things then this is the place."

5181,5.0,"Lots of choices with inside shopping as well as street vendors. Loved the busy shopping district on the streets of Myeongdong. Got a Doctor Fish Pedicure here for about seven dollars, and loved it! Found a small pizza shop that made Bulgogi pizza that was deliscious! Tons of make up/ cosmetics shops to choose from here. This is the skin care jackpot if you like stuff like that. Friendly shop workers - Krispy Kreme doughnut shop and Smoothie King smoothie shop were a big bonus. Bought a nice wool hat from an outside vendor and bought lots of bath fizzes at LUSH. The religious street pushers promoting their beliefs on a loud speaker could have done without, besides that it was great."
5182,4.0,"Looking for Korean cosmetics?? Name it and you can find them here. Different clothing lines are also here, from Forever 21, H&M, MCM, Cath Kidston to Local Korean designers . And if you feel hungry after shopping , street foods, food chains and authentic Korean restaurants are everywhere. The fact that this area is crowded it's very safe. There are also roving tourist information in the area that are very friendly and helpful.  Just few suggestions: 1. Designate smoking area 2. Vehicles should be prohibited to pass during night. 3. Have a uniform or organize colorful unique style/design of push carts /stalls along the streets.  Myeongdong: Hyper Shopping is absolutely a must visit in Seoul."
5183,5.0,"I love this shopping center, can find anything! All clothing and accessory shops. There's also western stores like forever 21. My friends and i loved it, at the time we were new to korea and had lack of clothes, but this shopping area made sure we had a new wardrobe, cosmetics, clothes, SHOES everything you could wish for. It has easy access from the train station too."
5184,4.0,"My goodness, this was indeed heaven for the fashionable. Missha, Tony Moly, Aritaum, FaceShop, The Etude House, Skin Food, Olive Young, Innisfree monopolised this commercial area. Huge signboards 'blared out' their own cosmetics brands and skincare, attracting crowds of prospective customers. It was very obvious that those who patronise these shops were 98% young people. They filled the streets too. Sale was on when we visited, some as much as 50% off. It was very easy to hail a cab as many of them were parked along the kerb of the main road. Good eateries could be found here too; TwoTwo chicken, Myeongdong gyoja, dunkin donuts, etc. It's most certainly a must-visit when you go to Seoul!"
5185,5.0,Loved the Nanta show at this location. Not sure if it's cos we went on a Saturday but there were lots of street stalls in the streets too. Lovely food choices including colourful cotton candy!

5192,5.0,"7 days 6 nights stayed at Myeongdong. In love with the weather (Mid Nov) & enjoyed the shopping. If you can speak mandarin, you shall not worry when you are at there but for english, it's kinda difficult to communicate. Myeongdong is big and crowded of youngsters and it's very convenient to walk around. Seoul is just that ""big"" where you can actually walk around if you have the strength and with the right footwear. Overall the expenses of food is kinda expensive but i think it's value of money because the potion is enough for my husband and i."
5193,2.0,"A local told me that Myeong-dong more of a strolling destination for locals rather than a place to eat or shop. Tourists, though, love this place because of all the shops and tourist friendly restaurants. I stayed in this area and ate in this area. The food was overpriced (15,000krw for a single bowl of bibimbap!?! 35,000krw for three strips of beef for the grill?!?). The upside is that this neighborhood is very central, well connected by the subway, has decent hotels, and can have some nice crowds and food carts at night before the shops close at around 11pm."
5194,5.0,"Great shopping district in Seoul , easy to get there by subway from Seoul central . The area is divided in separate sections of cloths , footwear , food so make sure you have a look at map . Market is active on night or evenings . So make sure you go there in afternoon . Good fun time and great shopping area"
5195,5.0,"i love going to myeongdong, there so many cosmetic shop and delicious food. and you can shopping all around the time here. you must give space to long time here. becuse if you just going one or two hours here you get nothing. kkkkk"
5196,4.0,Best place for female shoppers only. Sorry guys. Price is reasonable than Dongdaemun as the latter marked up the price high and has to bargain at least 40% down.
5197,4.0,Weather is very cold during this period and this does helps us to get in to most shops to get some warm air and also buy some souvenirs home.
5198,4.0,"I went here early summer 2014 to get some last minute shopping done and it was cray2!! I just didnt expecy to see this amoun rlt of ppl after my China trip. The streets were jam packed with people. I thought I beat yg he tourist crowd by going in May but you just don't beat any crowd when you go here!! But anyway, it was a bit shocking but I took this part as a great experience.  Be careful while shopping. Some of the sales ppl are quite forceful so you might break your wallet! I was prepared to only spend $200ish but ended up spending $500... it was of course my decision but they are seriously selling machines on steroid!! Anyway I'm quite satisfied with the quality of the products. I just expect stuff to be cheaper over there from what I've heard but they sell at the same price and they didn't particularly give me more samples than other stores would. So I was a bit bummed about that...  So I saw a lot of cafes and some BBQ Restaurants. They looked l Iike the hip place to be but since I was so hot and tired and ran out of time I didn't get to try them :( Instead, I went to this hole in the ground restaurant lol. I wanted to try they're cold nangmyun that was advertised outside. The restaurant was great, I saw a lot of locals inside. Tho i was stared at, prolly for being the only girl who eats lunch alone. The nangmyun was super delicious. It was perfect for summer! I can't remember the name of the restaurant, sorry. Hope you guys go and have a great time!!"

Area is very handy to Hotels and is central to transport etc.

It is surrounded a by large and small hotels, a big shopping mall which filled with international luxury brands, too. It's a little bit noisy with loud music coming from the shops but it is also, vibrant, lively, bright and safe with beauty parlors, cosmetic depots, large cafes, open air restaurants, the street vendors, food sellers in the middle of the streets. It is very popular and fun to visit at nights but quieter during the day.

Besides the big name stores, there are dozens of smaller stores selling a wide variety of goods and innumerable restaurants and cafes that cater to a wide variety of tastes and budgets. Food stalls are not as numerous as in other places but they are there and can be found, usually at the entrances to the main shopping streets. Do look beyond the ground floor as there are many shops and eateries on the upper levels too. Myeongdong is easily accessible by subway and bus and there are usually multilingual guides, recognisable in their red jackets, at major intersections."

5208,3.0,"Personally find this overhyped. Perhaps because I've been there a couple of times. If you want the typical face shop and other korean masks etc, you may find it very interesting. However, the sales people are mainly Chinese, rather than Koreans. They are at times over pushy as well. This makes the shopping experience less than desirable. I ended up eating, more than shopping."
5209,5.0,This place is definitely a great place to shop and visit especially for Foreigners and Expats. I recommend a trip here for people visiting Seoul.
5210,3.0,"Shopping, lots of it and street food along the way. Good for a quick stop and browse, but not a destination on its own. At least not for a family with kids."
5211,5.0,"wow..!! verry happening place... that place never sleep.... lot of foods, clothes , fashion and everything......"
5212,5.0,"You will go mad at this place, Top brands and local brands every where. the street is full of all types of shopping. Cosmetics, Clothing, Bags, Eating Outlet. You name it they have it. 101% recommended if you are going to seoul."
5213,4.0,"This is a compact area with a lot of restaurants and retail. We were disappointed by slim pickings of local brands, though there are a few. Its a good place to buy that winter coat if you showed up without one heavy enough for Seoul's bitter winter nights. Great restaurant selections. More Mandarin speakers than english though. The roaming tourist info people were really nice."
5214,5.0,"Experiencing Seoul, Korea is an exciting adventure. It's should be between Hongkong and Japan. A mix of both countries I can say."
5215,1.0,really nothing to see here unless you are coming from a 3rd world country. Prices are high and you can find everything in other shopping malls.
5216,5.0,"Tons of famous beauty store located in this Myeong Dong Street, a must for all ages,ladies and women to visit here to get all your daily essential needs or getting as a gift for friends and relatives.Price are good when some stores have a special promotion at 50 % off with freebies."

5219,4.0,"This is a very nice shopping area, it has everything. From signature items to the ones locally produced. There are also eateries around and it's nice to walk around and window shop."
5220,4.0,"Likes - All the things you need, this place has it... most in discounted prices! And lots of free goodies if you ever you buy an item. Hell yeah! What you need are keen eyes (to look for great stuff), patience (mandatory) and lots of stamina (to search the whole area for best finds). Most saleslady speaks good English, so don't worry. As they say, seekers are always rewarded! For tax-free items, Lotte Mall is the name. For items with lots of goodies (especially cosmetics and other beauty products), you can find it anywhere in the vicinity.  Dislikes - Never go on a weekend, else you'd break a leg or two (from the crowd!) Most locals go here on weekends, so please beg off. Weekdays are more forgiving, if you get my drift."
5221,4.0,"this is a market with everything to offer and lot of eateries from various cuisinesif non veg. try pork cutlets and not miss the thick noodles,and for ladies a lot of cosmetics available"
5222,5.0,"If you are looking for cosmetics, here's the place to start. Most shops will offer fantastic discounts and have staff that speak Mandarin. For boys, there are shops that offer clothes and shoes that offer a a good range."
5223,5.0,So many many shops both in Lottemart but also in the streets around. Cool cafés and restaurants and ramen shops.
5224,3.0,"So many shops to see... So many were the same. Skincare, shoes, souveniers. We were there at the end of the night. It was really busy, still. I enjoyed the browsing but I was really tired. I should have some earlier in the day when I had more energy. I did buy some slug/snail cream. It's all the rage!"
5225,5.0,"From all brands of famous Korean brand cosmetic (Face shop, Nature Republic, Etude House etc.) to Variety of Street food and restaurant  Visit the SM town stars and Lotte World Plaza where you can find almost anything from Kimchi to Pork Knuckle to Souvenir for the Korean stars are found here  Much more interesting than Dongdemun. This is also where the locals go to not just tourist  One day Is not enough to complete your visit.  A must go location for Seoul"
5226,3.0,"the prices is no t great , ad a lot of chaos in the street if you look for bargains go to the out let in the digital complex"
5227,5.0,"This is a great place to shop. They had everything! You can get makeup, clothes, food, basically everything you could ask for. I came here during the weekday and it was crowded, but it was even more crowded on the weekend. You truly feel like you're in the middle of all the action. It's a great place to shop or people watch."
5228,4.0,"Skincare products/ clothing shopping & even Daiso is there/ ton of restaurants, eateries/ cafe & snack stall by the road side for you to chose from. Enjoy your shopping and embrace this vibrant part of the city."
5229,4.0,"Personally I think shopping is not cheep in Korea, yet the products you buy are genuine. Have not see so many cosmetic stores,,,they exist because korean women's buying the products, bit difficult if you really don't know what product is and if is going to be suitable for you. If you toll you might have difficulty to get the right size,,, Yet enjoyable experience"
5230,5.0,"Koreans know how to shop. And I don't think they ever drop. Amazing selections from clothes to random wares, you name it. And it's conveniently located at the base of Seoul Tower so after you go walk around as a tourist, walk around as a shopper! Problem is that most Koreans still don't know how to speak English so the sale usually involves a lot of nodding. Thank heavens I have restraint because I wanted to buy a lot of souvenirs!"
5231,5.0,"What a surprise... amazing shopping, street food and crowds! More coffee shops than I have ever seen, but great to relax for awhile and watch the people :-)"
5232,4.0,"I love the vibe here where you can shop and enjoy watching people go by. It offers a little bit of everything, even entertainment like the Nanta Theater, which we actually had the opportunity to go even at last minute notice. Lots of cosmetic shops where you can get the face masks or BB/CC cream as souvenirs to bring home. They offer them in bulk and also provide lots of freebies.  Even if you don't intend to shop, it's a great place to walk around and feel the buzz, stop for coffee or just walk around. I love looking at the street stalls serving street food, selling small accessories like socks, etc. Nighttime is probably the best time to go where you can also enjoy the lights."
5233,5.0,"Responding to the call of freebies and discounts had me shopping my heart out for beauty products, apparel, shoes and accessories! Find where the tourist information center is and then go about shopping wisely. Take note of the Tax Refund Counters for tourists. There are lots of good buys if you take a step back from being overwhelmed by the sales people calling on you."
5234,4.0,Tons of shopping from small boutique shops to names brands as well as restaurants and cafes. It seems you can find just about anything here! I did not see super high end in this area though.
5235,4.0,I only spent about an hour as I already knew what I needed to get. There is a Laneige flagship store there too. The sales people in most of the facial product shops will most definitely throw in extras but you can always ask nicely for more if you spend a lot. Lots of eateries around too although I did not manage to try any.
5236,4.0,"You have to go to Myeongdong when in Seoul. It is a fun place to be in. Lots of side streets and little interesting shops around. Lots and lots of cosmetic shops and the usual mass market international brands. There is also a lot of street food at night. I personally did not do much shopping here, other than buying some Korean cosmetics, but I just love the buzz of the area."
5237,4.0,"If you are looking for big name brand apparel, most often on sale, this is the place. The whole area is filled with anything you could think of to buy, and every street is dotted with food carts selling traditional Korean snacks. If you want a larger Korean meal afterwards to reward your hard work, Myeong-dong suffers no shortage of fantastic options."
5238,4.0,"There are lots of cosmetic stores and you can enjoy there to seeing very interesting things. also there are lots of rests around and n the night, there are lots of street foods, so you can enjoy eating on the street too."
5239,5.0,"myeongdong is one of the best place i have been to in seoul. i think every 10 blocks you will see missha, nature republic, and etude house. also some branded clothes, restaurants, coffee shops. best thing are the street foods. went there at night. place is over whelming for shopping"
5240,3.0,"Myeongdong has a long history. It's been a centre of shopping for Seoulites for years. But by 2000, Japanese started to occupy this area, and in recent few years all the tourists started coming to this area, and now it got to a point where you see more tourists than locals in the area. One of its attraction was that the area is all walk-only streets and cars are not allowed in. But now the downside is that it gets more people to fill the streets than the cars passing by, making it one of the hardest to place in Seoul to walk around. Now, it is a nice shopping district indeed. But that's if you want to hop in Uniqlo, H&M, Zara and all those global fashion brands which are available everywhere else in the world, and by the way cost more than most of other countries. Most shops are also available in many other downtown spots in Seoul, there's not a single unique shop that you can only visit in Myeongdong. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend this area so much. You can go once as a tourist attraction, but if you're looking for genuine items you can only get in Korea, I'd look elsewhere. You know almost everywhere in Seoul is extremely crowded but this area is one of the worst. It used to have history, but nothing is special now, except for Myeongdong Cathedral which is the best catholic structure you can see in Korea."
5241,5.0,"In our 7 nights stay in Seoul, we went to Myeongdong on drily basis for eating and shopping you can spend a whole day there if you wish but we opted to go for few hours a day and then cross to lotte for more shopping. The street food in myeongdong is very variable and is good value for money. It's an nice place to be even if you are on a short visit"
5242,5.0,"If you like the hustle and bustle of markets this place is great! There is many different cosmetics and skin care shops, great little alleys filled with awesome eateries with nice cold beer! The sights and smells are really great but if your not into crowds I would stay away! Ive been twice and cant wait to go again"
5243,4.0,"This is the best shopping street in Seoul (in my opinion)  Gals will go crazy :D  Whether at day or night, it's really full of people and really crowded  When you shop over 30k won, remember ask for the tax free!"
5244,5.0,the night market is the best!!!! lots of good food. the cosmetics were on sale and there are free items when you shop.
5245,5.0,"There are lots of beutiful small streets with everything you want: cosmetics, cloths, shooes, k-pop, Cds and ""Pancoat"" shop with couple cloths. Also there are shops with couple rings. It's interesting place and you can go there by underground to ""Myeong-dong"" or ""Euljiro 1 ga"""
5246,5.0,A really great place to visit. Go at night when the lights are on and it will wrote you with its lights and all of ours action. Your senses will tingle.. Smell sight and sound is amazing.
5247,5.0,"Myeongdong is the place with numerous stores, especially clothing and cosmetics. If you like shopping, you should stay for at least two days. The prices are acceptable and you can find different styles of clothing here. There are also many cosmetics with low price. You can find many famous brands there. Bring lots of money before you come to Myeongdong."
5248,3.0,"Might be the timing coz the first time I was here, a kpop was having a guerilla performance so the street was quite crowded.  I bought a poncho in a stall while im here.. Overall, i love the street coz it is so lively.. but if i were to stay in a hostel around this place, i dont really like it.."
5249,3.0,"I have mixed feelings about this area. It is so crowded all the especially with tourists from the world over. That is fun in a way but also makes for congrsted and kinda messy experience. I like going to the large Uniqlo here for t shirts and stuff. Overall it has lots of cosmetics, shoe stores, clothing stores, etc. for a more youthful crowd. And to s of restaurants including the famous Myeongdong Gyoza."
5250,3.0,"Lots of foreign and Korean shops, most selling roughly the same thing, for an under 30 demographic. The foreign shops are the type frequently in Seoul malls (e.g. Zara, H&M, Aldo). Otherwise walk across to Lotte or down the road to Shingsegae department stores. Dining options are limited but getting better and there's plenty of street food if you're feeling brave (& don't count calories). You can wander the side streets for hours, but seriously, on weekend afternoons it is wall-to-wall Koreans and tourists (esp Chinese these days) so while it's kinda fun to experience the crush of people, it's fairly unpleasant if you're actually shopping. Mid-week is better if you're even slightly crowd-averse."
5251,3.0,"You'll find bunch and bunch of cosmetics store there and almost every store offers discount. Even without discount, the prices are quite stimulating for the ladies to start wanting something from the stores.. yes, many of the items are much cheaper than in other countries (than Indonesia, and based on my blogservation on several reviews from shoppers from other countries). Yet, not all items priced lower than on Indonesia's online shop.. what i did was I screen capture the page (with items i plan to buy) from the usual ol store where i usually buy my products and compare it when i'm in the store..  Besides cosmetics they also have lots of street foods, but I had no chance to try them much.  Another interesting place to visit is Daiso.. it sells many interesting Korean household items at good price.. everything is around 1,000 - 3,000 KRW -- if you're thinking of buying some snacks, this place is quite recommended"
5252,1.0,Far too many people and rinky dink shops selling cheap junk. If you love Huber busy places with little room to move you should love it.
5253,5.0,A lot of fun mixing with the locals and a lot of tourists. very busy with a lot of skin care shops everywhere who try to allure you in by giving you freebies! A lot of fun till very late at night
5254,3.0,"Here you can shop for fun, look around while looking for items you like. What is sold here mostly clothes, shoes, piercings and of course food. If you are lucky then you can find the items you like at bargain prices. Watch the temperature, last time I was there the temperature is so cold."
5255,5.0,"Such an intense place to go shopping, specially with the underground subway shopping too! You can easily get lost but you'll have the best time finding hidden gems :D"
5256,2.0,Pushy sales reps outside the shops. Lack of consistency as stores of the same brands in the same vicinity have different promotions and discounts resulting in different pricing for the same product.
5257,4.0,"You can shop just for the fun of it. And watch the lively night market. For serious shopping, there are other places, e.g. Yongsan, where you find arguably the largest camera and electronic shop in the entire world."
5258,4.0,I do not really like getting Cosmetics at Myeondong but I love their local brands and designers there!
5259,5.0,"This area, mostly famous town for tour, is the combination of shopping, accomodation and eatery. Also cluster of tourism in old twon stars from here-Insadong, Samchongdont and namdeamoon. Working in near office for 20 years, I have come to visit this place for shopping. Nice place for the local too."
5260,3.0,Good place to shop and walk around - depends on what you really want but big malls are just behind the corner - choice is there - friendly people - English knowledge is weak
5261,5.0,"for guys who don't think there is much excitement in makeup shopping and other crap women buy....may I suggest to 'gain some points' and pretend to suffer along. Excellent coffee shops, great street food and lots of action to keep you busy while your better halves and money over hand and fist. Great afternoon carrying g bags, eating street food and people watching"
5262,4.0,"You can get lost in the crowds. There are many stores, carts, restaurants and food carts. Bargains to be had if you carefully peruse merchandise carts."
5263,4.0,"Numerous fashion and cosmetic shops, Lotte, Avenuel, Shinsegae and Migliore! A day spent in this area is not enough!"
5264,3.0,This area has lots of shops and street vendors. I personally prefer street vendors because you can find the shops everywhere. But street vendors are authentic and exotic. Also don't forget to buy some street food there
5265,4.0,"After hearing so much about it, I was excited to indulge in Myeoungdong. I took the subway and followed the exits to the Shopping arcades and from the get-go, you are flooded with bright lights, and lines of fashion and cosmetic stores!  Most cosmetic stores offer you a free face mask or sample to try when you walk in the door, even if you don’t buy anything! However most stores, once you enter, a sales assistant will follow you around trying to get you to buy stuff, which may be slightly annoying for some people.  I enjoyed shopping at MISSHA, Nature Republic and Etude House, which have several stores in the area down different shopping alleys. Apart from shopping,  I also loved the street markets which sold all different kinds of yummy street food for very cheap prices! I tried a 3000KW ($3) chicken kebab with cabbage and wasabi, meatballs on a stick, corn on the cob (not the best though), and a $1 burnt sugar sweet pancake which was surprisingly good.  If you like this type of activity there is also a Café Café and Dog Café in the area and if you visit both, you get 50% of the second café! Just look out for the guys dressed as cats and dogs around the main street handing out flyers.  I loved this place so much I came here two nights in a row to shop and sample some of the best street food I’ve had in a while! For guys, the endless amount of cosmetic stores may be a bit too much ;) Definitely come after 5pm, when the street food stalls come alive and the stores are open till 10pm!"
5266,4.0,"A lot of good stuff could be found here, socks, cosmetics... Street food is also found here and could feed you for dinner but I've found them a bit greasy to me.  Shop along street is also good, sometimes you could find a good quality coat at H&M for only $39,000 won. Good place to go at night."
5267,5.0,"This is certainly the place to go for shopping in Seoul. Streets of popular brand stores H& M etc. Love the mix of shops and you do not have to go far for a coffee shop, and they are not Starbucks thank goodness. Just Loved the buzz and the people. Busy both day & Night."
5268,4.0,"A lot of great stuffs to buy, Not sure if it's affordable than any other, but they have cool and great stuffs displayed. Didn't shop that much bec. the place is so crowded."
5269,5.0,"Here is Well-known area for shopping specially for clothes, shoes and cosmetics.  Oh and lots of cafe are located at the streets.  And it was close as Seoul N towel."
5270,4.0,"You can literally find all the comestics brand in Korea along this street. Across the different alley, you will get to see repeated same cosmetics brand. There are also nice cafe for you to stop by and have a slip if you are tired from the shopping and walking."
5271,5.0,"WHEW! This place is the spot to be if you want a one stop shop. Myeongdong is more ""high end"" then the other local areas such as Dong Dae Moon and Nam Dae Moon. There are literally hundreds of vendors in one city block that's screaming at you as you walk by for your business. From Western stores such as Nike and Addidas to local Korean shops such as Faceshop, this area is bustling with activity at all hours of the day. At night, the streets are packed with local vendors selling anything from socks, to knock off purses, to electronic equipment. Not to mention all of the glorious street food that you can get for just a few dollars.  If your in the mood for some high end luxury department store style shopping, make sure you check out Lotte and Shinsaegae - which closes around 8pm vs. the other stores which seem to be open at all hours of the night. These department stores reminds you of a Bloomingdales/Neiman Marcus and carries high end American and Korean brands as well. If you do stop by Lotte, make sure you check out the food court for endless rows of yummy goodness to eat!"
5272,5.0,"This place transforms at night into the most fun, hip place around with street food on steroids! Crowds of people teeming around interesting carts of unusual foods. Everyone having fun."
5273,4.0,"Liked: Many eclectic small shops, mostly clothing and cafes. Disliked: Gutter sewage smell coming from under ground sewage piping."
5274,5.0,"If you would like to buy any korea cosmestic brands, just go to Myeongdong and you can get it. Don't forget to try a local restaurant nearby Myeongdong. It's very good taste but a little bit expensive."
5275,3.0,"Most of the sellers speaks english or chinese, some is japanese. There is almost hassling, the competition between one shop and another is so fierce, so some sellers practically drag you into their shop. Too bad."
5276,5.0,"This area is crowded with street vendors, stores and high-end stores. A great place to look for gifts for family and friends."
5277,4.0,"Great shopping, but the place is crowded and noisy. However lots of choises especially for young people. There are shopping malls both over and under the ground."
5278,4.0,"One of the busiest street for Korean style street life. Its easily accessible to come via subway too. I always get lost in the street with sooo many things to buy... cosmetic... shopping.. fashion.... food... everything.. this is a heaven for the female but definitely not for your man or kids if you are with them. hahah....  Food wise is good too.. you get to find stalls or even restaurants... this place is very much like the ""Ye Shi"" of Taiwan but on a more high class standard. It can get crowded as it gets darker.. so try to go in the early evening to avoid the crowds."
5279,3.0,"It seems everybody who visits Seoul ends up int his place. The streets are lined with shops, most of them selling Korean cosmetics - Faceshop, Tony Moly, Nature Republic, Misha, etc. You find these stores ion every street you go to in the area. The streets are narrow and so crowded. There are also people selling street food and other wares on the streets making ti even more difficult to go around. However, if you want a taste of shopping, this is the go-to place. You will find everything here -clothes, footwear, cosmetics, electronics, etc. The store staff are friendly, speak some English and eager to please (maybe becasue there are just too many stores selling similar stuff!). There are also ample eating places and money exchange shops. The exchange rates are also better here than in other places in the city."
5280,5.0,"You can easily find all Korean beauty products here! And they have more than one shop of its kind. Upon entering they'll give you a free sample, and once you've purchase something they'll give you even more free samples! :D"
5281,5.0,"I love this area..you can find everything great restaurant, cosmetic shops, clothes etc...  This place is happiness.. not only because i love shopping but its the happiness ive seen in the peoples eyes around here.. everybody is busy.. enjoying.. this is for me a very beautiful view indeed."
5282,5.0,When I am in the mood I love to come to Myeongdong for some high-flying fashion and amazing restaurants during the day.. and partying and night clubs in the night. This is one of the best places to see authentic Korean street life. And a must for any visit to the city. I visited here last christmas and will go again this year!
5283,4.0,Went here for dinner on a Wednesday night and it was alive and bustling like a Saturday night anywhere else.  Great atmosphere and array of different shops with little market stalls in the middle. A lot more commercial than other markets but the food on offer is amazing.  Recommend any night of the week but most stalls do close up about 11:30pm even on a saturday night.  Easy to get to on the train as well.
5284,3.0,"If you enjoy the hustle and bustle of busy street life then, this is the area to visit. Lots and lots of shops ( open until late ! ) but no top end shops. Many restaurants, street food and an evening market. An interesting place to have a walk but not my type of place to shop."
5285,3.0,"Many street stalls like Dongdaemun selling snacks, knick knacks in front of brand name 2-3 storey shops like Face Shop, etc. Nothing truly spectacular except great bargains on facial products and street wear. One special snack - egg in sponge cake."
5286,5.0,"lots of variety for shopping. a special acknowledgment to Davich optical shop where I got my glasses in one hour! good eating, though I'd skip the food stalls on the road as they are mostly fried and bad quality."
5287,5.0,"This is one of my favorite places in Seoul because it is a shopping haven. I did not know that there are tons of Korean brands of BB creams! And the most amazing part is, there are lots and lots of sale items. Aside from shopping, there are street foods that are worth trying. Although the place is crowded, it is clean and you will feel safe."
5288,4.0,"Most of the shops are American and European brands. But we did get to shop at some local Korean places as well. Plenty of coffee shops and restaurants to choose from. It gets really crowded and we were not aware that most shops don't open until around 11AM, so don't get there early!"
5289,4.0,Best go late afternoon or evening as lots of night market stalls.  Best place to buy cosmetics n socks! U get lots of free gifts for your cosmetics purchase. Huge varieties of cute socks at cheap price!  But I feel Myeodong has somehow lost its 'Korean' charm compared to many years back where there are more Korean style or concepts shops.  Am surprise to see Thai foot body massage in this area which don't really blend in. Would be great if it's traditional korean spa! Am sure will be great business. We always wanted to try but don know where to find a good n nice ambience Korean hot spring spa!
5290,5.0,"Souvenirs, food, facial product, clothes and etc. You name it, they have it here. One of the busiest street Seoul. Must visit place and you can spend at least 4 hours walking around this area. Very lively at night."
5291,5.0,"Myeongdong is a very busy shopping area with lots of tourists all the time. The day and night scene is different. In the evening, you will see many street food hawkers and stores along the streets which make it very interesting. It is a great place to shop for cosmetic, masks and skin care products. You can find all the Korean brands in Myeongdong. Its also a place where you will find many restaurants and cafes. You will be spoilt for choices!!"
5292,5.0,"At first it's quite overwhelming with the volume of people, shops, street vendors, etc. We stayed across the street from Myeongdong and visited almost each of our 5 days. Each time we went back we saw something new that we missed in the past. Perfect location to stay."
5293,3.0,Here is one of the most popular shopping area for HK people in Seoul. However the items here become more and more expensive.
5294,4.0,"Of you love shopping then one day here would not be enough for you. We went here on a Saturday though and there were so many people, mostly Chinese tourists, that it was difficult to go around the shops without bumping into someone. It was the 2nd day of autumn so most of the stores put their summer clothes on sale. Great bargains in H&M. Try the TOP TEN store, they have good clothes at bargain prices. Most of the shops there sell cosmetics. I didn't buy any but they had good prices too. Tip- wear comfortable shoes and don't bring anything bulky or heavy so you can move around comfortably."
5295,5.0,"A good place, if you enjoy the hustle and bustle of shopping, lots of variety in consumer goods and lots of variety of food. Good place to cosmetics"
5296,4.0,"It is a huge area that in the evening really turns into a market in every street as cart vendors arrive with their replicas or pirate merchandise of things such as burberry, louis vouitton, gucci socks, shoes, scarfs, throws, headband, pony tail holder, etc. etc. Some of the carts have prices, which I suggest you buy there as where there is no price when you ask they gave you a higher price that the one they gave to Korean people. Just for an hour or so is fun to visit it. Also in the area there are lot of stores of skin care products."
5297,1.0,foods no good and expensive and we couldnt find big and tall size clothes. one of stores were very very tiny to us even though the size was 3XL. we felf bad.
5298,5.0,"Myeongdong is in the center of Seoul, I found many great shopping options, beautiful areas for walking or having a quick meal or drink, and it has easy access to Myeongdong metro station and to Lotte department store. Once you arrive there I would recommend you take a walk to Namdaemun flea market near by."
5299,3.0,"Its a place where you shop till you drop, lots a great food attraction, small clothing's for bargain. Night life is also extremely busy and happening. Definitely the most skincare shops in Seoul, free samples around if you just take a stroll into their shops."
5300,5.0,I stayed at the President Hotel so I was very close to this area. It is great for shopping and eating . Most places close late so you can walk around at night take photos and eat.
5301,5.0,It is good to see the nightlife here. So busy and happening. There are so many food places here and shopping to see. love the rush rush of nightlife
5302,4.0,"Visiting Myeondong Night Market was a good decision because the food is delicious and cheap. You can choose from a variety of street food--juices, grilled meat, dessert (ice cream). There are also many dry goods (bags, shoes, clothes, etc.) in the stalls that are reasonably priced. But you need to compare the prices of some food stuff with the grocery. We found some items to be overpriced."
5303,5.0,"This place is great if you want to explore all the cosmetics and facial care that Korea is known for. I and my daughter had a wonderful time checking out the different brands. It was difficult as not all brands have an English translation but we totally enjoyed the experience. We left with several bags full of cleaners, masks, creams, etc. for ourselves, family, and friends. We've already tried them and are very pleased with the results."
5304,5.0,"Lots of people at night, with street food and shops. Very safe, even though the place is always packed. Restaurants can be expensive because they are taking advantage of the tourists."
5305,4.0,"cosmetic clothes and you name it they have it here. ladies will be thrilled by the various brand of cosmetics. from missha,skin food ,natural republic and alot more. there even have dog and cat cafe here. there is a famous dumpling shop in this area and always packed with tourist. you can take photo in the seoul visitor centre too."
5306,4.0,"Do you like shopping? Then go to Myeongdong, the most trendy and stylish shopping street in Seoul. If you are not so interested in shopping, you can visit Myeongdong Cathedral, stamp museum, Seoul Global Cultural Center, Kimchi making experience center and more, all located in Myeongdong,"
5307,4.0,Amazing! You can spend days shopping. Anything and everything you could possibly think to buy is here. But have self control or you will need to purchase a suitcase just for all the new stuff.
5308,5.0,"It was fantastic shopping here. There are shops galore and if you shop till night, street food is everywhere to try. Sadly the sizes are rather small and some shops won't let you try. Wear comfy shoes though else you might end up with aching feet.!"
5309,3.0,This is like a Must Visit place in Seoul. The atmosphere is great but you must go there during the night when the street stores are opened. But fashion is more expensive than other areas in Seoul.
5310,3.0,"If you intend to come here just for the cosmetics (eg. Korea brands, Laneige, nature republic, faceshop, etc.), I will recommend you to go Lotte duty-free departmental at Exit 7 or 8 of Euljiro 1 ga (still in Myeongdong area). They are cheaper than the retail. You also don't have to go through the tax refund process which I find the procedure very troublesome.  After submitting the tax refund form to the global blue or global tax free, you still have to go the custom at the airport to have the form stamp. My encounter with the custom officer at the airport is not very pleasant. The officer is very rude and unhelpful and does not speak English.  If you buy from the retail, it is more expensive and you also have to spend more than 30,000 won to be entitled for the tax refund.  The shopping street is quite rowdy. The staff at the cosmetics shops are all Chinese. They will shout (high pitch) to draw you to their shops."
5311,5.0,"I loved it!!! You have every brand, you name it , they have it..not very cheap though but you dont go there for souvenirs you go for real shopping spree...I'll be back for sure."
5312,5.0,Visit red house restaurant if you are around. Very nice place and nice seafood ever in the street of myeong dong
5313,5.0,"I have to go there every time I get a chance to go to Korea. It's always crowded with people, a lot of interesting fashion products, especially cheap but well-made cosmetics. It's like a heaven for shopaholics!"
5314,5.0,"Lotsa shopping lotsa street snacks and good food. What more can one ask for? I stayed at the hotel right on Myeongdong, and enjoyed shopping there. Bought lotsa facial items and had lotsa snacks. I must have put on some weight!"
5315,5.0,"One of my favorite places to shop. I never cease to shop here as I find many interesting restaurants, clothing stores and cosmetic shops."
5316,4.0,"Too much to see, not enough time. If your priority is shopping and your budget allows you to indulge, I suggest getting Myeongdong out of the way during the first few days of your stay. It's one area I feel I didn't have enough time to fully appreciate because we saved it for last on our trip. The eateries ended up looking the same, and so did all cosmetics-selling stores."
5317,5.0,"Market where u can find a lot of knick Knacks.. Like socks, make up,facial stuff. Etc.. It's a place to try also there specialties in desserts like sweets or candies they make out of scratch n put minced nuts.. They were all delicious n u buy them on the streets.. A place u shouldn't miss when u r in Seoul ..."
5318,5.0,"Myeongdong is so full of life in the evening, with plentiful street food, restaurants, cosmetic shops, and hordes of people. If you are female and enjoys Korean skin care and cosmetics, this is the place for you. You will see all the name brands like Innisfree, Tony Moly, Etude House, Iope, Laneige... EVERYWHERE. The stores repeat on almost every corner, so there are multiple stores of every brand in the area. Prices are much cheaper here than buying overseas, so you see people buying products in bulk. In fact, if you want to buy a single item(instead of like 20 eyeliners at a time. hahaha), you need to ask them to separate the package. They will do this grudgingly. There are also currency exchanges everywhere here, and the rates are competitive. However, if you can go to the bank, the bank still seems to have the best rate. Food here has a lot of varieties, so dinner here is a breeze if you are adventurous. Definitely come here at night for the atmosphere when everything is lit brightly, crowded, and energized. :-)"
5319,3.0,"I went to this market on Sunday evening, the place was crowded with lot of young Korean girl and boys. The first thing that you see in market are the glittering lights and then nearly 70 percent of the shops cater to cosmetics with lot of girls asking you to try the shop. It's a shopping heaven for women, but for men I was pretty bored and even the clothing was not cheap, I could get the same in my country.  I was new to the country, so did not dare to try the street food which otherwise was looking good. If you have ladies in your group then visit the market otherwise for only boys, one could avoid."
5320,3.0,"This was where I bought a lot of my souvenirs. They have almost everything one could think of to bring as souvenirs. But many of the goods were expensive. As a consolation, there was plenty to eat while we go shopping."
5321,3.0,"It's THE place for skin care products. What this means is that; Ladies grab your shopping bag and begin your shopping spree! Goods are of good quality, price is reasonable for skin care products, but not for fashion clothing."
5322,3.0,"Myeong Dong is an area of Seoul entirely dominated by a vast array of beauty shops selling Korean beauty products. Some of these shops sell cute products in the shape of bunnies or bears, but for most of them you won't really be able to understand what they are for and what they are made of, since almost everything is only written in Korean and the shop assistants hardly speak English. Even if you are a western tourist with snow-white skin, the shop assistants will still try to sell you whitening products (!!!) at any cost, since it is very fashionable in Korea to cover the face with white creams to look as pale as possible (considered as beauty ideal). Be aware not to fall for the miraculous anti wrinkle creams made up of some unidentified snail parts (some say the slime, others the guts of the snails...) that they will try to sell to you at extortionate prices (10 ml for 70 GBP), as there is absolutely no evidence that they work, apart from making the producers rich, of course. They also sell trillions of masks, some again made of snail parts, some again whitening, some with the picture of feminine-looking local Kpop-stars on the package. You are expected to wear these masks for some 40 min and use one every day, again, I doubt that they may do any good at all. The shocking thing about this area is that you will find up to three shops of the same chain in the very same street, selling exactly the same stuff, and another one in the next street on the left and another one on the right, which means that you are surrounded by the same shops and the same products over and over again, until you get sick of it. Myeong Dong gets incredibly busy from noon onward, so I suggest that you go as soon as they open, if you can, to avoid the total chaos. I found the shopping experience there interesting but up to a certain extent, after which, when it gets crowded and loud, you will wish to depart from it asap. Stay away from the street food, as there is no indication that the sellers wash their hands before, during or after its preparation and you may end up spending the rest of your holiday confined to your room. Myeong Dong can be reached by underground, line 4, station name Myeong Dong."
5323,5.0,Nice brand outlets confined in one shopping area. You don't have to walk very far. It was Choseuk holiday when we went so shops were giving good discounts
5324,4.0,"I visited Myeongdong to find souvenirs, as read on some blogs and websites, during a recent trip to Seoul with my sister. When we got there, I was a bit disappointed as it was an area full of beauty shops all lined up right beside and across each other. You'll see the most common as well as local brands such as The Face Shop, Nature Republic, Etude House, Holika Holika, Innisfree, and Missha. I am not a fan of beauty products so I didn't enjoy the place that much. However, I loved Myeongdong due to the many restos and street food stalls in the area. It was also fun to sightsee young Koreans take a stroll in the crowded streets dressed in their usual cute outfits.  If you are looking for new beauty trends and products, make sure to visit Myeongdong. All you need (and want) might just be around the corner. :)"
5325,4.0,"An absolute highlight for shoppers (especially Chinese). Food vendors, trinket-selling carts, big malls like Lotte, shops for clothes, cosmetics and lots of restaurants and cafes. Myeongdong is made for a half-day happy time. People watching is fun enough if not going for shops. Walk down till the end you can find some inexpensive restaurants, also in the narrow side alleys."
5326,5.0,"so much fun on seoul and bought a lot of stuffs such as sports wear, food and cosmestics like nine tree hotel so much ,good service"
5327,4.0,"This place has both, the small road side shops and branded outlets. There are quite a few cafes and eateries too. I personally found this place better than the Namdaemon market."
5328,4.0,If you like shopping then this is a must. You could really shop until you dropped.  I went with a group for 4 ladies who planned the trip to buy cosmetics. Ended up going in every shop twice. They absolutely loved it. My salvation was a nice dinner at one of the many restaurants in the upper parts of the buildings.
5329,4.0,"Nice to go and see what the youth of Seoul get up to, but make sure you are not tired and are full of energy. Even then some might only manage a half an hour in this crazy, youth filled, colourful, maze of streets, eateries, shops, stalls and street performers. People everywhere. I am not sure there is a quiet time to go as this was a Wednesday evening. Maybe during the day? And when its quiet without the vibrant youth is it worth going? Probably not. Nice to stroll around and observe the culture of Seoul from the perspective of the young people. However not a huge amount of actual South Korea heritage to be seen unless it is being exploited for tourist reasons."
5330,4.0,Still we got some good buy with 50% on good hiking shoes! Staff quite friendly but too many cosmetic shops!
5331,5.0,"I'm not a huge shopper but I enjoyed getting ridiculously lost for hours around here! Street food, free beauty samples and lots of atmosphere. You've got to experience it at night :)"
5332,4.0,"Myeong-dong is just about the craziest shopping area I've ever experienced! We went in the early afternoon and stayed through the evening, and it's just as bustling during the day as it is at night.  You can find a wide range of shops and vendors here - from nicer, indoors shops to cheaper, outdoor artisan vendors. There are barkers shouting at you from every angle to come into their store and enough neon to make you believe it's noon at midnight.  There are also lots and lots of coffee shops, sweet shops, restaurants, and convenience stores if you work up a hunger while shopping; but I suggest visiting one of the street vendors for fresh fruit on a stick, gimbap, or a spicy, boiling hot plate of tteokbokki.  Apparently, there are a LOT of plastic surgery practices located in Myeong-Dong as well; which makes it a super popular place for tourists who have come to get less expensive surgery.  Make sure you wear good walking shoes and drink lots of water. It's easy to get dehydrated and tired rushing around this area. But, if you're looking for something trendy at a good price, this is the place to be!"
5333,4.0,"There's a lot of great, fashionable stores in Myeongdong. The street food is delicious too. Sadly, I didn't get to stay in Myeongdong for very long but it was a lot of fun. I'd recommend to stay a few hours for all of the shopping you can do. I'll certainly return when I go back to Seoul!"
5334,5.0,"If you like shopping, this is definitely your place! There are literally hundred of stores (clothes, electronics, beauty shops) both korean and international brands. There are also lots of places for eating (korean or western style). It is also really close from the N Seoul Tower. Not enough exact words for describing this place, it is just a must-visit location."
5335,4.0,This market is crowded both during the day and at night. Lots of eating places and shops. close to a subway station.
5336,4.0,"Myeongdong is a must-see if you're in Seoul, but it's extremely busy and if you have any sort of social anxiety, avoid it. It's very noisy, there is a huge crush of people - many of whom have no qualms about barging people aside - and it's full of distracting sounds and sights. However, it is good for shopping, eating and has a handful of great movie theaters."
5337,3.0,"Well known district for shopping and must visit. The many brands ,Korean and International is available and the indepandant selling shackes are providing alot of options. The Pricese are a bit High in compaer to other markets. Overall, its nice area to hange out with family or friends all day."
5338,2.0,You need to walk into a cafe - order something - then have access to a toilet. I guess this is a given in such open space shopping areas. I wonder where vendors go to take a pee when nature calls.
5339,5.0,"Never image there is the most busy busy street, A lot of hawkers on the streets, whatebver you like foods/ goods........ you can find, a lot of different nationality tourist shop around. It's like carnvial."
5340,4.0,"shopping, streetfood that is fairly cheap and quite good, performances by musicians, lots and lots of shopping,."
5341,3.0,"I liked the place because aside from the shopping there were also a lot of restaurants where you could take a break from after shopping. I noticed though that some stores like The Face Shop, Nature Republic, Missha, etc had so many branches within the same area."
5342,5.0,"Nightmarkets and makeup shopping. Even I as a male recognized that the makeup and cosmetics being sold in Korea were a huge steal. With store upon store next to each other in high density, one is able to buy all sorts of products and also get many freebies. The multiple face masks we received for free for entering the store are normally $5 Canadian so even visiting the stores gave us some things to bring back for our friends.  Lots of restaurants to choose from. It was fun!"
5343,4.0,This is like orchard in singapore. A lot of shops for branded bags and clothes. What I love most are the street foods they are so awesome
5344,4.0,"lots of young people are there. nice street shopping and food. if you want to get to know Korean young people, their fashion and fun stuffs, this is the place for you:-)"
5345,4.0,"I can stated that Myeongdong is the amazing shopping centre in Seoul. I went there at night and this place is very crowded by tourists and locals till' 11 PM. You can find many food stalls, souvenir shop and a bunch of many worldwide branded shops as well as Korean brands (esp. cosmetics shops). The location is also very strategic, you can get there by subway or bus. If you want to feel the hype of Seoul's night, I very recommended you to visit this place. Don't forget to taste the local tradition foods. Its a must!!"
5346,4.0,"This place is one of the most liveliest place in Seoul, Korea, always buzzing with people. It is the place to visit for someone who likes shopping. This place where one can find some of the world famous brand shops(likes of ZARA, H&M etc.) in one street. On the other hand, there are many famous Korean brand shops too. This fisuion of local and international brand shops makes this place worth visiting. Also the famous 'Namsan Tower' is nearby the shopping destination. It will only take 8-10 minutes by walking from the shopping place to board the cable car ride to the Namsan tower ."
5347,4.0,Many Cosmetic shops and sales girls will lure you in to buy. I did and was happy with my purchase. There are many restaurants.

5350,5.0,"I'm not a shopaholic but still totally stunned by how dynamic the shopping environment is, richly fuelled by a wide spectrum of products."
5351,4.0,"We stayed in the Ibis hotel in this district, and it has been really good choice as we had a lot of shops, restaurants and really good atmosphere in this part of the city. Amazing how crowded it is at any time and how shops close so late in the evening, at 23:00 hrs or so.... Full of restaurants, some at street level, other in a 1st or 2nd floor and really hard to choose where to have dinner without tripadvisor!!"
5352,3.0,"Even if you don't buy anything, it's worth visiting because it is quite unique compared to usual West-European shopping areas. Never seen anywhere so many coffee shops & restaurant packed with shops. Please, have a look up as well because there might be 5-20 shops in one building and you see only the one with a window :-)."
5353,5.0,"Great Shopping, Entertainment, and Street Food. Probably the busiest shopping area in Seoul with all the labels and fashion you could be looking for. Also a great area to just walk around and taste all the street food. Certainly a good day of adventure."
5354,3.0,"Crazy shopping particularly for the females, however you can find the brand name clothing stores here. Becoming quite touristy so be wary of the crowds. Most stores open after 10:30am - 11am."
5355,5.0,"The streets were quaint and interesting. the shops had unusual jewelery, a lot handmade. The clothing in the stores was different and unusual, but suited for Ametican wear. The shop keepers were friendly and helpful about their merchandise. It was fun to walk around the area."
5356,5.0,"We ate at the Myeongdong area a couple of times. The place has alot of stores and outside vendors and lots and lots of young people. The soft serve ice cream is so good. Green tea with vanilla or strawberry were my favorites. Bought a purse from an outside vendor, my hubby bought some street food, NANTA Theatre is right there, even a burger king and mcdonalds. There is definitely something for everyone. Good restaurants too. Lots of fun. Close to the Lotte dept store which is huge."
5357,4.0,Enjoy shopping at those funky little shops and roadside stalls very much and with lots of eateries to try out. A great experience for shopaholic!
5358,4.0,"It gets too crowded every evening, mostly with tourists, mostly japanese. A BIG spot to shop and the best whatsoever. Try to come on weekday, preferably daytime. Thus, ypu'll get a chance to shop and not only be moved by a surrounding crowd"
5359,3.0,"Starting early evening the Seoul summer sale in Myeongdong is the perfect location if you want to discover Korean street and easy-to-eat food. You can also get some shopping, meet people in the crowded and vibrant atmosphere of that night market."
5360,4.0,"This is one of the most interesting and at the same time the most hectic place of the city, many tourists and a high concentration of people, including high-rise buildings and shops, in short, a very lively part of Seoul. I went there in the afternoon, I saw some pictures at night and I must admit it's always nice to come here."
5361,4.0,"Hi, I have been to Myeongdong in Seoul in June'14. It is such a great place for shopping enthusiasts, esp. females... it has so much to offer for both budget shoppers and high-end shoppers.. Fashion, Cosmetics, Korean Herbal products are the key highlights. All in it is one of best place to hangout and must visit in Seoul, South Korea...  Cheers! NT"
5362,3.0,"Shopping here is fun as there's so many things to buy here. However, many outlets of the same brand can be found in the streets and it's like a repetition again. All the salesgirls will keep persuading and convincing us to buy in bulks.  Honestly, I prefer to shop in Hongdae area"
5363,4.0,"Very interesting shopping, a variety of shops selling fashion and cosmetics made in korea along the way. The place of Korean youths hangout with a very interesting outfit. ."
5364,4.0,"If you are a shopholic or a cosmatic lover, this is heaven for you!  As a Thai, this place is very well known for cheap/best discounts for cosmatics and super loads for free samples but after I experienced this place, there are a lot more than that!  You may found out that many sellers can speak Chinese, Thai, Japanese and also a little of English. It's very helpful but sometimes it's still hard to understand what they said (but of course, better than notthing)  There are many cloths shops that you may take time for a week to discover them all.  For food, there are many Korean and Japanese restaurants. I recommended School Food on the 5th floor of the same building of Zara (sorry I forgot the name)  Only con that I found is there are only a few restrooms."
5365,5.0,"It is a conglomeration of awesome shopping in one place, from cheap to luxury, it has everything. If you love K-Pop or K-Drama check the upper levels of some of the shops because they have some good places tucked away for DVDs."

5367,5.0,"Crowded with people mainly tourists from China, buying skincare. The same brands of skincare shops are in every street. Each time you walk into a shop o buy an item, you will get many samples to try. Do try & visit the Daiso, as they offer a decent selection at a good price."
5368,5.0,All the shopkeepers can speak Mandarin which is very convenient. The Cosmetics shops will give a lot of sample even if you buy just 1 or 2 bottles.
5369,4.0,"Shop all day. Go crazy. That's what Myeong Dong (and nam dae mun) is for. With so many different shops around, you can not , not find what you want.

5370,5.0,"Wow - this area has every type of shop you could want, from high and medium end international chains, to some small cute boutiques. If you're a dedicated shopper you can easily spend a whole day here. There is also no end of places to eat when you need to rest your feet and get some energy. The area is incredibly busy and crowded so be ready for some serious hustle and bustle. It's totally worth it for the great shoes and handbags!"

5372,4.0,Street food was great. Local restaurants in area were great as well. A lot of stuff for sale. The cool part was we were there on the night of their local art market. There were tables of handmade goods being sold and local artists performing. Really special. And the goods being sold were truly made in Korea. Location is near Jamba Juice by the display of different types of money

5376,3.0,Big market having local stuff. Don't think of quality. Having 10000 KRW stuff but all are local and very cheap quality. If you want quality than you have to pay 3-4 times higher than standard prize.
5377,5.0,"Lived right in the centre of Myeongdong which made it even more exciting. It is alive from the early morning till late night; without any of the rowdiness or calamity that usually comes with these kinds of shopping areas. The streets are clean and usually crowded but still allows plenty of space to navigate safely and stress-free. Loads of small shops selling clothes, skin care (galore!), food, shoes, accessories, etc. Endless choices, great value! Food vendors which come out at night add to the vibrancy and give you a good opportunity to experience good food. There are also plenty of food outlets which offer excellent meals; both local as well as international cuisine. There's always something to discover if you walk around long enough. Great experience!"
5378,4.0,We (family with two teenager daughters) went to Myeongdong on a Saturday and was blown away by the atmosphere. The streets were filled with many people and the shops were amazing with many discount. And there were many snack options. It was a great place to do window shopping and to find great bargains.

5385,4.0,"I've lived in Korea for a while and this is the best place I've found to get western sizes for both myself and my girlfriend. With many shops like H&M, Forever 21, nike and others its great one stop shopping. They are also a number for street venders for purses, phone cases, and other nik nats. Which make it great for tourists as well. There's also a lot for food options but they tend to be on the pricer side."
5386,5.0,"This place is great for shoppers with its varied and affordable buys. If you are tired of the shops, you can always walk to Shinsegae Dept Store or Lotte Dept Store too. And the subway is just at its doorstep."

5390,5.0,I went to Myeongdong many times and I feel tired of walking and shopping at the end of the day always. But if you are a shopaholic like me then hardly you can stop yourself wandering around the streets for hours. Dont forget to energize yourself with street foods. I like the potatoes and the the chicken most.
5391,5.0,"I stayed at Ibis Myeongdong which is just around the corner walking distance. I loved the shops here, great for Korean made makeup and Creams. During the day there is all the regular shops open from 9.30am and from 5ish pm all the street food and Accessorise stalls come out. It is so much vibrant at night time and very busy. Loved everything Myeongdong had to offer, definitely a must if in Seoul."
5392,5.0,Don't forget to ask for discount with cash payment. Looking for sale item as well. Another thing is don't try to negotiate and touch the item if you're not sure to buy.
5393,5.0,Women will love the skin product shops which are abundant and cheap but apparently of high quality. Street stalls start setting up at 5 pm. Shops are good value and I believe the quality to be better than Nandemun market.
5394,3.0,In London with a waist size of 36 and shirt collar of 16 I have no problem in finding clothes to fit.I was given outsize trousers which ioffer could not put on my legs and no shirts my size.so a fruitless hunt.I suggest trying th food hall of the little department story.so much to see and eat here.
5395,3.0,"I think only women will appreciate shopping here & mostly for Korean skin care products since all brands can be found here in multiple outlets ( a testimony to how well they sell? ). The shops sell mostly foreign brands which may prove cheaper back home but we did find the selection of sports shoes here to be more expansive, like Japan. Koreans love their shoes so I guess that's why the collection here is more complete. You can find a few local brands here like 8 Seconds which may be worth a look for the ladies."
5396,5.0,There is so much choice here and the place is buzzing. There are a lot of food opportunities as well. I would recommend going here if you want to shop for fashion and beauty products
5397,3.0,"it is mostly textile concentrated and I could not find any good deals. the up is that a number of shops is open till very late. there is also an openair market that opens at around 10-11pm but price/quality ratio is not good. The textile I like the most in Korea are socks. There is a huge selection, OK quality and cheap."
5398,5.0,"I initially didn't understand why Asian tourists (Japanese and Chinese) are mad about this place. So much to do, shop, eat and enjoy. Korean cosmetics shops offer so many free samples (quality of Clinique and L'Occitant at such amazingly affordable price). Cinema I visited offers such professionally sounded and clean environemts at US$6 per movie. Shopping in general is very good and cheap for such quality. There are so many well known restaurants (simply look for the venue in long queue). Most of famous restaurants in Myoungdong isn't like fancy ones, but known for the tastes for generations. Easy come easy go kind of places, from dumpling, Korean sushi, Korean BBQ, noodles (both cold and hot), Korean styled fried chicken (assorted or spiced), pork cutlet et el. All accept credit cards except street food. Korean seems quite honest with the price, so they won't rip you off because we are a foreigner, but always try to negotiate to cut 10%, which they gladly offer (in street store, not in a shop). Transport is available to all directions, and I had a very good time. I personally make sure to stay nearby (Westin Chosun, Lotte Hotel or Grand Hyatt) when I visit Korea for business. Sort of old town with genuine fun."
5399,4.0,its the place for those who is looking for skin care product. the price were really cheap and affordable. besides they give you lots of free sample!
5400,5.0,"It's really amazing to go on shopping in this area were you have a lot of options. Actually you might get confused because it is really A LOT of options to choose from, from bargains to well fashioned boutiques. Street foods are also must try because they are all delicious!!!! I'll go back!!"
5401,4.0,"We came here after visiting Namdaemun Market as it is close by. We were already exhausted by the time we arrived but had so much fun wandering the streets. My teenage daughter and I enjoyed getting the free samples of face masks being handed out. Even if you don't want to buy, it is nice just to be courteous. So I recommend to go into the shop and browse after receiving the freebie and then thank them as you leave. We did not buy very much however it is an experience to see it all and the crowds of people. The area is great for cosmetics and clothes and many restaurants to choose from."
5402,4.0,"This is the one of the high-end shopping district in Seoul where you can also find local cheap accessories. Plus, there are plenty of street food and local restaurants for a quick bite or to dine-in. I went here almost everyday, just to stroll around since they are very near to my accommodation. Seoul is also one of the most fashionable city in the world, and thus, you could find a lot of great clothes and accessories."
5403,4.0,"Myeongdong Shopping is one of Seoul's main shopping area. It is a fairly clean and modern area with departments stores, lots of shops and restaurants."
5404,5.0,"Super vibrant and lively area. A lot of great shopping, especially cosmetics (make sure to get some free samples). Great korean street-food there as well. We came back several times for the shopping. Make sure you check out the malls in the area (can't remember the name, Lotte maybe?)."
5405,3.0,Myeungdong is a shopping paradise for the young - lots of good eats there also - fun to just spend time looking around!
5406,4.0,We went to Myeongdong on a Sunday afternoon and the place is crowded! Very lively place! There are so many things to see and food to taste. Cosmetic haven for girls!
5407,4.0,We thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere here. Yes it was busy but that adds to the whole fun and hype.  If you are not a fan of busy times go during a weeknight like Monday-Thursday it's not as busy.  Great food options with market stalls everywhere and obviously lots of shopping
5408,3.0,"This is the place where you can get pretty much everything. From shops selling tourist knick knacks to cosmetics to household items. Food galore too. Lots of korean food options in the little lanes. They have tourist booths spaced out in Myeongdong, get lost just head to the tourist booths to get a map of the area. This is also a short walk to Lotte Shopping Centre."
5409,4.0,"The first time we went in the afternoon after we went to Namsan Tower. It was unbelievably busy. There were people and food stalls every where. All the shops were open and busy. It was a great atmosphere. At the time it felt a little full on. I think it may have been a holiday in Korea that day??  The second time we went in the afternoon on a week day, it was pretty much dead comparatively. I was really surprised. There was almost no street food around, and it was just like a regular number of people walking around shopping. It was definitely more exciting when there were more people. Which is the exact opposite of what I expected!! If you actually had some things to buy i'm sure it'd be easier on the quieter days though!"
5410,3.0,"Myeongdong offer a lot of things from cosmetics,clothes to street foods until you got headache which one to choose..crowded with people as it is one of tourist attractions for shopping but the price is quite expensive compared to other places.."
5411,5.0,"Can't wait to visit Seoul back and definitely I'll come to Myeongdong again. Ladies, enjoy your huge makeup, accesories and girls things here... If you use korean cosmetics, don't hesitate to buy in extra items. You'll regret it once already back to your home. Because it's extremely cheaper even if you compare it with any online shops. And definitely it's original product and you'll get abundance sample every time you buy. Love it right?!"
5412,5.0,"it was excellent that we have booked a hotel inside this hyper shopping area! you can find a lot of things. mostly Korean products. many many cosmetic products for women (and men too, surprisingly). lots of places to eat, street food are tasty and cheap, and clean so safe to eat. We have bought some nice shirts and shoes and other souvenirs. It is hard to convert to your country's currency as the won has low value compared to other currencies so prices are in hundreds and thousands even for simple items. nice to take photos on the middle of the streets. The sales attendants are polite and charming. Definitely a good way of observing the modern Korean life especially of the young and how they dress themselves. On the evenings it is particularly interesting with the neon lights and all.."
5413,4.0,"everything you want from food, clothes and accessories. in some big corners there are tour guide and information staff that speaks multiple languages and are very helpful!"
5414,4.0,"a huge shopping area, they give free maps with english speaking staff in the theatre area, loved the street food..."
5415,3.0,"The street is mainly for people watching I would say. Although there are a lot of shops selling cosmetics, however they are too crowded. You can get the same cosmetics or clothes at Hongdae or Ewha with cheaper price. Not a fantastic street."
5416,4.0,"Experience the true energy of the youth of Seoul - great shopping and restaurants - street food and cafés. Most of all, it is about the absolute jam of beautiful humanity packing the streets and alleys as they shop. The energy and vibrancy is amazing."
5417,4.0,we visited this area both at night and during the day. Well worth the visit for street food and some good shopping
5418,4.0,My wife and my daughter priority choice to visit when we plan to go to Seoul. Very good cosmetics products and the price is very fantastic compare to Indonesian price for the same product.
5419,5.0,"Myeongdong is basically a shopping heaven for women.  There is alot of cosmetic / facial shop. You will not be empty handed returning to your hotel as if you buy a small little stuff from their shop, there will still be freebies for you.  Of course, the more you buy, the more they give their freebies to you."
5420,4.0,"Myeongdong is much like any shopping mecca you can find in every major Asian city. But if you're spending time in this bustling shopping area, give your brain and wallet a break and go see the outrageously funny production of ""Cookin' Nanta"", a slapstick comedy that you'll love. You don't need to know one word of Korean to laugh your way through this. It's at the Myeongdong Nanta Theatre. Just ask any shopkeeper in the area for directions, but I strongly advise advance tickets as this usually sells out. Don't take just my word for it -- check out more reviews in ""Things to Do' for Seoul."
5421,4.0,"Large and small streets, large crowds, snack vendors and skin product pushers. This is where the real shopping happens, with shops open until 10pm and some even longer (at least on Friday and Saturday, not sure of other days). Expect loud music coming from many shops and a mixed crowd of locals and tourists. Fun and energetic experience, even if you do not want to buy anything (but be sure to try some the snacks!'"
5422,5.0,This place is for those shoppers like me who loves buying. These Street Shops are complete. From accessories to a complete outfit! :)
5423,5.0,"It was a center of the Seoul and still our downtown. But nowdays, our economic center has changed to Gangnam so MYUNGDONG is just a official downtown and Gangnam is a real one haha.  It""s more modern and vital in Gangnam but Myungdong has It's own attraction. These days, many foreigners come here, especially Chinese and Japanese!! So in Myungdong you can see Chinese and Japanese menu in restaurants and shops.  And cause there are many foreigners here, many non-brand clothes shops started their business. I recommend you to look around here and buy some souvenir haha.  I guess most of you are intersted in Gangnam, and I think Gangnam is better than here.  But each site has It's own attraction.  So come here^^  Keep in mind we are very polite country.  Most of us are poor in English!! but we are trying to help you.  If you ask something to us, even if that one can""t speak English, he(or she) will try to find someone else who can help you or at least help you by a body language ..haha  And in Myungdong there are many people so you may find some one who can speak English.  Don""t hesitate to ask us for help.^^"
5424,5.0,"Excellent place to shop and eat, Osulloc , Paris Baguette and a lot of cosmetic brands are here. The small shops in the lanes are good places to get a good deal for clothes, accessories and shoes. They close rather late so you can shop till you drop."
5425,4.0,"Good place to go for better, name brand products. Shops are within walking distance, its a pricey shopping neighborhood. Shops range from the Dept stores, to boutiques. All ranges of products, good, services. Look for Official tourist maps/guides to this area. As with any type of shopping in korea if you're a foreigner, know what the prices are back home, especially if you're an american or European. Import taxes on designer goods may not make these goods bargains."
5426,5.0,"You will find every brand on every corner of Myengdong. Food is also everywhere.!!!! and the metro is just right there. Yeah, you can just cross the road and go shopping at Lotte Duty Free. Don't forget to bring a lot of money. That's all. hahaha."
5427,5.0,"Great atmosphere,didn't expect to buy very much but came back with clothes,skin care,make up and shoes.Clothes in all sizes and communicating wasn't an issue as most people speak English to some degree.Were told prices were higher here than the markets but we didn't think there was much difference at all.Found some great eating places and cafes off the street up staircases on 2nd 3rd and 4th floors."
5428,3.0,"Ah, the sounds and smells of these types of places. More than you can possibly even figure out unless you read Korean. Something to check out once but not sure a typical visitor would really buy much here."
5429,5.0,For people who have girlfriends or wives that love make up go here!! either it be night or day plenty to choose form they also have a variety of food and shopping to cater for everyone fashionable.
5430,3.0,"You can eat your way through Myeongdong. The food carts have everything. The shopping consists mainly of the same cosmetic stores on every other block. Only bought a pair of socks. It is very crowded, which is half of it's charm. Mostly the hang out of young Koreans."
5431,4.0,A lot of shopping options and restaurants. Street food is abundant too! The prices are a little expensive though.
5432,4.0,"Great experience. Lots of shops. If you love shopping, its place for you, but prices are very high in Korea."
5433,4.0,"There are many shops to look around, so if you like shopping then it's worth trying. However it is really crowded especially in weeknds. So be careful! But you don't have to worry about pick pocketing or something like that. Seoul is a very safe city even it's a place full of tourists. oh but you don't want to spend your whole day here. Just pick up a map and visit some other places before and after. Enjoy!"
5434,5.0,"If you like shopping, this will be paradise for you. If you don't, suggest you keep away!  The Myeongdong area is essentially a huge shopping district comprising shopping malls, boutiques, and restaurants all interconnected by lane ways and roads. In the evening, the laneways become even more lively as stalls open up.  We personally enjoyed the atmosphere on the street and smaller boutiques more than the large shopping malls. Certainly picked up some bargains.  Keep an eye out for the street vendors selling local delicacies. They have to be sampled!  Be prepared for lots of walking and lots of crowds! Generally stroller friendly but many of the stores are rather small and you will be pushing through crowds.  Closest station is the Myeongdong train station."
5435,4.0,"Myeongdong is best experienced on the streets, not in the malls. Even if it's cold, just soldier on with a heat pack and everything would be fine. There are 4-5 outlets of the same brand within the area so make sure you are setting a unique meeting point if you're meeting friends.  That said, it's overwhelmingly catered to female shoppers, with cosmetics and skin care taking up the majority of the lanes, and most of them are local brands.  There is a sprinkling of clothes and bags and even fewer eyewear.  If you are looking for international brands, hit the malls but that would defeat the purpose of coming to Korea to shop.  The street stalls are equally interesting - there are food, 4000KRW scarves, 1000KRW socks. There's also shoes, belts and bags at various prices. Most are made in China and the vendors would charge a premium for made in Korea products. I would not take their word for it; if you are in doubt of their quality, don't buy."
5436,5.0,"If you 're young people, don't. miss this area. A lot of store for shopping. A lot people go there for eating, shopping. You should go around 7pm , you will see how amazing there."
5437,4.0,"Myeongdong is absolutely beauty heaven. I've never seen another shopping district quite like it, the mega malls are excellent but the individual shops are definitely worth a look as well. Very easy to spend an entire afternoon shopping. Most shop attendants were more than willing to attempt English or communicate through signs to assist."
5438,1.0,Not much sets Myeongdong apart from your typical Korean shopping mall. You'll be more comfortable indoors come summer and winter. Watch out for careless shoppers eating and waving their skewered sticks of meat or potatoes or you'll get an eye poked out.
5439,5.0,"The shopping district in seoul. Has the mega malls like Lotte department store and shinsegae department stores. But the best is the small alleys and streets which has some of the best shops. It's the center for Korean cosmetics- almost all the major Korean brands have multiple shops across the area. You can get great bargains for the cosmetics and also some have tax free option for foreign tourists. Also has the Myengdong cathedral and myengdong theater, both worth visiting. Easily the place not to be missed, when in seoul. Shop shop and only shop."
5440,5.0,best place to buy ur make up and they offer reasonable price as well.. too bad they speak a little english which makes us harder to communicate
5441,4.0,"I love this place! A very busy and big pedestrianise shopping mecca. Lots of shopping centres and food stalls and stalls that sells all sorts of stuff. The big attraction here is Face shops! There are plenty here and the main thing to buy is face mask!. I got pack of 20 for 20,000 Won and the sales lady even gave me some samples."
5442,5.0,"This is one place in Seoul that we loved so much my husband and I came back 3x and I don't think we can say we explored every inch of it! When you come earlier the streets are still passable by car, but come after lunch I think and it is filled with food cards everywhere! While I had my pick going from one cosmetic shop to another, my husband was doing the same with the food stalls ; p  Amazing place, despite the crowd it was very safe, no pickpockets, no fighting. A bit of shoulder bumping I guess but all in all I'd gladly explore it again."
5443,5.0,"Some reviewers said that it is like Orchard Road in Singapore, but I beg to differ - it is far more interesting! Besides the big brands like H&M, there are many many small shops in the entire shopping streets. You will need at least half a day to shop and eat here. The streets get crowded and more stalls show up at night. What interests me is the Korea-made clothes/bags. I bought a pretty good quality leather sling bag (Korean brand) at around KRW 37,000. Good quality blouses and cardigan at KRW34,000 and up. Saw cheaper clothes but the quality does not appear to be as good. Only thing is that all shops I went did not allow trying of blouses or pants, but you can try on the jackets/cardigan with no problems. Most pants and skirts I saw are free size, therefore no trying. They may be more suitable for slim and petite ladies and not so much for taller people."
5444,4.0,"Countless facial & cosmetic shops with staffs giving out free samples as you walked past their doorstep. The place become more interesting when night falls with street food and push cart. Confusing walkway, be sure to approach those tourist guide in red to get a detail map of Myeongdong to help find your way around."
5445,5.0,"Myeongdong is a must visit place for tourists. It has several major department stores like Lotte Department Store and Shinsegae Department Store and there are street stalls, retail outlets and beauty outlets. There are also plenty of restaurants, fast food and street foods in Myeongdong."
5446,5.0,"So much to buy! Make up stores like Etude, Face shop and Tony Molly are everywhere! They give free samples right before you enter their shop. There are a lot of street food too. One of my favorite was the waffle with strawberry which costs around 3,000w. You can also find Dog cafes in the area."
5447,4.0,"The shopping was interesting!! Cafes galore!! However, the facial shop got stale after walking past identical ones rows after rows..."
5448,4.0,Multiple super sized shopping malls and lots of street shopping and food too. Crowded and fun! Tourist info is a good stop for help and tips. Found a great hair salon called Juno. One of the best experiences - fast efficient service but also warm and accommodating. We came out with great hair in 45 min!
5449,4.0,"Myeongdong basically has everything you need when it comes to shopping. Clothes, make-up, bags/purses, shoes, eyewear and restaurants for when you need a break. From designer and brand name stores to independent stores, it's got it all. It's definitely a must when you come to Seoul. The crowds can be a bit much after awhile but as long as you prepare yourself mentally ahead of time that it'll be super crowded, you'll be fine."
5450,4.0,"If you want to shop (beauty products, clothing, hats etc) or eat (street food, restaurants, coffee shops, ice cream etc) then you should definitely come here. But be forewarned that it is packed, it is busy during the day and then even busier at night.  Great place for people watching, especially since you'll be swarmed by lots of people."
5451,3.0,"Myeongdong is a commercial area and therefore it is less chance to experience the real korean shopping. Most of the shops have staff who speak different languages, eg mandarin, japanese, english etc to serve tourist from different country. This is one of the excellent service you don't find everywhere in the world.  Only shortfall is it is always too crowded, especially at night, one can hardly move around. One can try to come in the day, nothing much to see but can find some nice restaurant hiding inside the small lane."
5452,5.0,"Loved this place, even though Seoul was chilly during my visit. You don't even have to shop big time. What I loved here were the different kinds of street food and the stuff they sell on the sidewalk."
5453,5.0,"this is the place you want to be if u want to shop until you drop..from high end brand to local brand, and of course a good food...  been there just when its The Grand Korea Sales, and for the girls..this is the place you want to be for all your cosmetic/make up needs."
5454,5.0,You can buy what you need and obtain the unexpected harvest. So many restaurants in it; So many cosmetics shops in it; So many cafe in it ……
5455,5.0,"Myeongdong is a vibrant area of shopping and food. It is probably best experienced at night when all the street vendors come out!  There is an immense amount of shopping and lots of street stalls selling local delicacies, hotteocks being my favorite!  The atmosphere is amazing here but ve aware of annoying sales ladies from the skincare stores yelling at you in mandarin ( if you look oriental and not korean of course! )"
5456,3.0,Taken there by the hotel shuttle. Just your typical shopping fare. Crowded and all the interesting odors of food and clothing combined.
5457,5.0,It was a bit on the crazy side of things when i was there so I'm not to sure if everyone loves begin harassed when you are simply looking around.If you can handle that then you'll be fine and you can get some good deals provided you are willing to barter with the vendors
5458,4.0,"I can't speak much for the shopping, but if you want to experience hordes of people and neon signs, this is the place."
5459,4.0,"I am not a shopping freak.. rather shopping actually freaks me out.. However, I must admit Myeongdong, provides a totally different experience. .. Myeongdong means Bright town and the place actually stands by it.. It has a air of liveliness driven by some road side vendors along with some good mid range brands like ZARA, Mango etc.. A nice place to shop around for some distinct souvenirs, where tourist generally look out for.. as well as some regular use stuff like jackets, caps etc... Place is well equipped with plethora of restaurants and bars offering local as well as continental flavor.. I enjoyed my late evening strolls around the place during my visit. The liveliness of the place with nicely done decorations for just passed New year and upcoming Lunar (Chinese) New year added to the ambience.. I understand that it has been selected as a UNESCO heritage place and I would say rightly so..."
5460,4.0,"Based on the limited schedule.I only spent 1 hour in this area.This is a girls' shopping heaven in downtown.Hundrends of cosmetic brands & fashion shops.The area is huge,you can take a whole day around.Coffee pub and restaurants all around so you can take a break any where if you want.Really a crowded shopping area.I'd rather sitting in a coffee pub to watch people.The local youth are all here at weekend.A must go!"
5461,3.0,"All the stuff you can find anywhere in the world. Cheap, but boring, unless you need some new cheap underwear and shoes."
5462,5.0,Tons of people every night of the week in a very large pedestrian only setting. Lots of shops as well as street vendors selling everything including great street food. try the octopus!
5463,4.0,"Impressive market area even for non-shoppers like me. Several blocks of closed streets, good shopping, quality food and street food. Suggest Bulgogi Brothers, good food, great service."
5464,5.0,A great place to shop and the place gets busier at night. A wide variety of shops. Modern and trendy place.
5465,5.0,"This is my favorite area in Seoul. You can shop and get a tax refund for the items you buy here. there are a lot of shops, restaurants, currency exchange, church, etc."
5466,5.0,"Great place for cosmetics, fake jewellery, trendy shoes. Good food. Try street food. Naemdum market and Lotte store alsoclose by."
5467,5.0,"just go here starts at 7pm.. i lovee this shopping district. you can anything.. whether local or international brand.. you name it, H&M, Uniqlo, etc.. don't be afraid if you got hungry, foodstall are everywhere, resto and cafes also."
5468,4.0,"a lot of shops and restaurants. I was trying to find some toy stores, but was not lucky with that. Mostly fashion stores."
5469,5.0,very crowded but a lot of shopping places. You can find a lot of cosmetics store. Also you can find variety of foods in there
5470,5.0,"A shopping mecca. For me it is like Time Square in NY at night. Very lively with lighted billboards. There are lots of restaurants, street foods and a place for shopping. Most esp cosmetic shopping. Women will love this place.."
5471,5.0,This place can get confusing because the same shop is on every other block. It is a great place to get gifts and ok knock offs. You can find so much to eat here and so much to do. It is very busy at night and filled with stores ready to help you spend your money.
5472,4.0,"You can buy anything, anywhere, from kimchi favoured seaweed to upmarket fashion. Myeongdong dumplings is a must try"
5473,4.0,I'm not a huge shopper so my review may be a bit biased. There are tons of huge buildings (plural!) that have multiple stalls/shops on each floor. I imagine that to look at each of the stores in the area it would take you about a year. No joke. If you're not a buyer for a store (wholesale buyer) make sure you're walking into a building where they sell to retail buyers otherwise you're wasting your time. There is a sprinkling of food vendors around here but not much to choose from so if you plan on spending a considerable amount of time here bring something to munch on. You'll need it!
5474,4.0,"If this makes sense at all, Myeongdong reminds me of The Grove in Los Angeles. Outdoor shopping mall with trendy brands. It just feels hip and youthful like that. We even ran into some sort of entertainment TV show being filmed with actress Choi Kang-hee. So although I had never heard of her, that was fun and intriguing to see.  Oh and we stumbled upon a tiny currency exchange counter that just happened to have the best rate we saw the entire trip. I wouldn't be able to describe where it is. I probably wouldn't even be able to find it again if I tried myself."
5475,3.0,"Basically, there are people blaring something over the microphone at every corner of the street, and sea of humans...they say shopping here is good, but I personally prefer Namdaemoon. It is worth a short visit if you want something americanized and want to blend with youth."
5476,5.0,"If you need somenthing just enter Lotto World and move via bridges from building to building. Huge choice, although a pricey place if looking for brands"
5477,4.0,"This,perhaps, is the coolest street shopping in seoul,close to namdaemun too, with the chic & sophisticated stuffs & peeps to see & be seen, foodies, bargain shops,stylish outlets, it's a cool place to walk & shop around, a must visit!"
5478,5.0,"Needless for me to say.. here is a shopping paradise for clothings, lots of cosmetic/facial products shops, restaurants and cafes. Since my hotel (Prince Hotel) is near Myeongdong, we came here almost every night. The cosmetic is definitely worth buying because of the lower price and some of the brands which are not available in Singapore. These cosmetic outlets even have staff from China who can communicate in Mandarin."
5479,5.0,"If you are looking for a trendy hip area that offers not only shopping and gifts for all ages and types, but lots of food - good restaurants, cafes and very local Korean food, Myeong-dong is an area you should not miss!  Dongdaemum was good for clothes and fashion, and nearby Myeong-dong - Namdaemun market, excellent if you are looking for gifts, touristy stuff etc. However, Myeong-dong hyper shopping district has a lot more to offer.  If you are a 1st timer, be sure not to miss this place, especially those of you looking for beauty products. You will be surprise to find that Faceshop is no longer THE beauty product shop. There are many more that has sprouted out, and that are just as good."
5480,5.0,"This place is a paradise for girls... especially for those who are into cosmeti and facial products!! Upon entering into the shop, they already handing you a free gift, be it.mask or cottons, the price is so much cheaper compare to malaysia and it mostly comes with some discounts and lots of free gifts... :D  As for clothing, there are a lot of shops in myeongdong subway station, which is pretty nice... but dongdaemun definitely provide more options in terms of clothing"
5481,4.0,"If you are around Myeong Dong don't miss the fun of shopping This area is filled with ladies beauty products in the night it is very coloulrfull and crowded> What ever the climate don't miss the long ice cream cone (32 CM). This area is good for girls and beauty concerned people not for men, unless you are with someone. Forgot to tell this street is filled with food it is really delicious and mouth watering."
5482,4.0,This is a must do if you are in the area. It's really vibrant at night with lots of street and food vendors. You never know what you'll find and it's so much fun to walk around and see what each vendor has. I enjoyed trying all the different street foods. Good stuff
5483,5.0,There is something for everyone! Nice atmosphere too and lots of different shops pop up here and there. There are some that are tucked away in the corner that offer good buys too..so keep your eyes open!!
5484,5.0,"Shopper's paradise. From facial products, to food, to phone accessories, clothes, I even had a Korean stamp made from my name in Korean characters from a little shop. Food aplenty, take your pick from the various restaurants here. Fast food, many Starbucks (for the avid tumbler collectors), street food (open faced egg sandwiches, sausages, toasted octopus etc). It's really a haven for shoppers and every nook and cranny has a shop that you must walk into. AWESOME for shopping, spend at least a day here, go during the day and and also at night :)"
5485,4.0,"Starting Friday night this place goes into a frenzy. Really busy, great for shopping, so much sound and so much to see and eat it is an attack on all the senses. You have to experience this at least once"
5486,5.0,"This is a place to be! a lot of nice shops and restaurants, Nanta theater. The area is busy 24/7. I love a Lotte department store for the variety of goods and food."
5487,5.0,"Shops galore! Everything I like from skin-care, cosmetics, shoes, clothes, accessories to restaurants and street foods. All these can be found from name-brand, mainstream stand-alone and mall stores to interesting street stalls. Vendors start setting up their wares around 4PM. Your visit won't be complete without trying Myeongdong's fascinating street food. Some of the elderly female vendors however mind much when you take pictures of their stall."
5488,4.0,"Very happening place. Lots to browse and buy if you are young and trendy. Lots of shops and stalls selling facial masks. The salesgirls at the doors will entice you with free masks to enter their shop and buy. Was told by a reliable source that the free masks gave pimples on his face after using it. Not sure if it is skin allergy or otherwise. Exercise caution. Free things not cheap, cheap things not free"
5489,4.0,"This area has everything, from designer to knock-offs, to korean brand cosmetics, clothing, bags, and shoes. Lots of food, photo booths, cafes, clubs, etc."
5490,4.0,"When it comes to actual shopping, I think the better experience in Korea is the traditional markets. But Myongdong is worth checking out just to see the throngs of people and the spectacle. I wouldn't travel way out of my way to go there, but if you're in the area for other attractions (multiple palaces and other historical sites are nearby) it's worth taking a look. There are good restaurants in the area too if you want to stop for a bite or a snack."
5491,3.0,It is probably just us - but when we travel going to stores that we have at home in the US is not our idea of a fun day. This is were the NANTA theater is and there are also several good restaurants in the district. If you are looking for something like an extra pair of shoes or a swim suit this is the place to look - otherwise there are better places to explore.
5492,5.0,Got a hotel in the area bec. wanted to be central. This place is bustling with shops esp. skincare and clothes. There's plenty of restaurants and coffee shops. Walkable to the stream and other sights.
5493,3.0,Its a nice aggregation of shopping malls and smaller shops. However most brands are available in any big city. What interested me was some of the Korean brands like SPAO.

5496,4.0,"Myeongdong is simply a one stop shop for shopaholics. I say this because I was there to experience it last April 26, 2013. On one side, it has got the Lotte World which has the Lotte department store, the duty free shop and the Avenuel ( which houses the luxury brands ). On the opposite side, you would find the shopping street which has the different retail shops and boutiques and the mini street market where you find the small stalls. For me, it is a fusion of high end, mid range and low end rolled into one shopping experience."
5497,4.0,"One shopping area which you should go is th Myeongdong Street - small street shops and stalls especially on cosmetics - a lot of sales girls will give free mask if you visit their shops. Of course they do sell other stuff such as belts, bags, etc - do not really have time to shop around but you must visit this place when in seoul."
5498,4.0,"You can shop for almost everything here. Most store have staffs who are able to converse in a foreign language e.g. English, Chinese and Japanese."
5499,5.0,shopping haven! discovered so many things to buy here and not expensve too! loved walking in the streets and communicating with local vendors. tourist friendly as well.
5500,5.0,"If you like to shop, you have to visit Myeongdong while in Seoul! I wouldn't go there for the choice of clothes or underwear, but they certainly have tons of skincare and makeup at affordable prices!"
5501,3.0,"It is a great place for shopping but for those who prefer souvenir or special traditional Korean item, Insadong is better! TOTALLY DOMINATED BY cosmetic shop!"
5502,5.0,"if you happen to be a shopaholic, myeongdong will be like, as they say, your mother ship calling you.  looking for some BB cream, CC cream or snail masks? no need to look far, in myeongdong the famous shops are at least 1 shop apart so have your cosmetics fill without breaking any sweat.  you can also find apparel shops, restaurants and even food carts. why not sample some twisted potatoes or some creme-filled buns? look out too for those sale that just might earn you your next heels or bag.  you know you're in the middle of myeongdong once you see myeongdong theater. i hope to see what's inside next time of this landmark.  another landmark you can find in myeongdong is the myeongdong cathedral. english mass is on sundays at 9 AM.  in myeongdong, i assure you that your all your senses will be satisfied, not to mention, (most importantly of course) your stomach.  so ready those cash and cards and go to myeongdong for your ultimate shopping spree!"
5503,4.0,"One of the must-go places in Seoul. Shopping heaven indeed! Comes with a variety of brands ranging from their local brands, average international brands and even the few high-end brands. Food stalls available along the way. Lots and lots of cosmetic shops (ie: The Face Shop, Laneige, Skin Food, Nature Republic, etc) Many goodies collected from all these face shops. :D"
5504,4.0,"Dominated by cosmetic stores, I think every cosmetic stores are repeated in every block. Be sure to ask for VAT refund if you made a large purchase. For a large person, do not bother to enter clothing or shoes store, as they will not have size available for you even worldwide branded stores, i.e., Nike or Adidas."
5505,4.0,This is Seoul's main shopping drag and one could wander around for days. The whole gamut of shops can be found there ranging from little boutique-like shops to large shopping centres. This is also a neat place for people watching and the younger Koreans are definitely up there with fashion.  I did however find some of the shopkeepers unfriendly and they did not seem to like people browsing or asking too many questions. A friend also found that you cannot try things on in some of the shops so buyer beware. Korean free size will fit the smaller Europeans but not the average perosn. Language is not a barrier as long as a calculator is available and ask for a discount - you never know your luck.
5506,5.0,"Busy night and day, the streets are occupied by wheelcarts shops as soon as sunset . Lots of restaurants, cafés, boutiques, the streets of Myeong dông seem to never sleep."
5507,3.0,"I dont know if it is usually as busy or crazy. We entered from around the Lotte Hotel area, and it got more and more packed with people. There were shops and eateries at all sides. Tables set up selling all kinds of Korean snacks from boiled silkworm pupaes to honey crisp biscuits. There were teams of Korean teenagers with 'free hug' signs, there were people dressed in animal costumes advertising local businesses. We found a great place to eat nearby, my Korean friends picked it, so I dont know that name :-( But we ordered a huge chicken noodle dish that was more than enough to share between 4 people. At the end we attempted to go down into the subway station. Talk about a human mountain, human sea!! It was busy getting down, but it was infinitely worse in the opposite direction! Overall,, too busy to really buy anything, but it was a great thrill to be in the middle of it all on a Christmas day."
5508,5.0,"It has all the cosmetics products you need to find from head to toes in this area. Current hottest products make from snail saliva, is a must buy item in your purchase. Nature Republic is the current hot shop in this area."
5509,5.0,"It is shopping heaven. Lady can buy many skin care, make up with a reasonable pricing. You can stay in there more than one day."
5510,5.0,"I would say it's really the best place to hang out. I live nearby, just across the street and I walk by myeongdong almost everyday and I have seen alot of interesting things and products.  Cosmetics are a bunch here, 5-6 faceshops in a single street. However the value is a lil steep as compared to the nearby namdaemun or dongdaemun (if you're good at haggling).  All in all good place to eat, chill or just a stroll. Maybe window shopping"
5511,5.0,"Myeongdong always our favorite place to visit we've been there in Summer, and now we visited in winter. The Seoul's winter is really freezibg, so when you visit Myeongdong, need to wear a real thick clothes.  The shops were amazing, many retailers (local or international) are there. From Zara or local made clothes and accesories. You may also find many other international brands.  The taste of the area was very Korea, very nice yet warm people."
5512,5.0,"Had anything u could ever want,, lots of food, snack, souveniors,,nice bargain prices almost like flee market type with vendors set up."

5514,5.0,"Korean beauty brands abound in Myeondong. What was exciting was the free samples that they give out. You can also find the Myeondong Theater and the Myeondong Cathedral in this area.  There are also food and coffee shops everywhere. For tourists like me, there are tourism information offices located in strategic areas. Myeondong also has several signs to help you with directions. Also, tourism information volunteers go around the area to readily render their help to those who are lost or in need of suggestions.  Myeondong is very accessible. Buses ply in this area. You can also take the subway and get off at the Myeondong station or the Eulji-ro 1 (il) ga station."
5515,3.0,"This is a central located shopping precinct.  Think lots and lots of small shops, plus mid brand range, H&M, Uniloq, Zara and the Koream shops..  I found it hard as a large male to fit into Korean shops clothes..the had great fashion and style .. Alas good for my wallet Lol...  This place is a shopping paradise for ladies... U name it the have it, cosmetics, shoes, dresses and accessories..  Shop ! Sop! Shop! But I found the Gangnam area better! It had great shops, tree lined amongst great cares, coffee n tea shops and restaurants.. Need another day in Seoul !,,"
5516,4.0,"To go to myeongdong is to shop.it is blocks(small ones) and blocks of shops and restaurants all packed together. Cosmetic shops, brand name clothing shops-h&m,unipolar,f21,Lacoste,etc., Korean restaurants,coffee shops(cafe bene,etc). The streets also gets packed with street food carts and carts selling all kinds of stuff-scarves,socks, shirts, bags,pants,etc.-as the day goes on.but, everything is still very organized,safe, and orderly. Their homegrown cosmetic/skin are shops like nature republic, étude,baviphat,etc greets you in almost every block. The promotions in each of these shops differ, one may be slashing their prices on some items ,but, when you reach their other outlets,prices may not be slashed.prices are good and the quality of Korean skincare and haircare products are really good ,too. The various restaurants are also good.it is better to dine in a proper restaurant than fill yourself with street food(where a stick of sausages would set you back by 3000won).you can get a decent restaurant meal starting at 6000won. Would recommend myeongdong for a spot of retail therapy.haggling is not the norm here..if you want to haggle, then, dongdaemon should be your stop."
5517,4.0,"If you're in need of treating yourself, myeongdong is the place to go! The are tons of high end clothing stores and delightful restaurants. As a foreigner living in Seoul, this was a great place to go for a little dose of home."
5518,4.0,"A place where many tourist and South Korean love, especially for girls. Shops after shops that are catered to women, like cosmetic shops and clothing shops. Lots of place to eat and street food vendors are there as well.  I bought myself a very nice backpack here, lots of fashion related stuffs being sold here, expensive or cheap you have it. A huge SPAO shop is located there also, if you love KPOP there's a EverySing shop that's right above SPAO. Premium Korean fashion brand Beanpole is right beside SPAO.  Great for shopping with friends, but if you're a guy and have girls that are with you then be prepared to accompany her/them for some crazy window shopping. Or just find a place to sit and wait for 3 hours to let them finish up shopping. This place is really a women/girl's heaven for fashion shopping. It's THAT good. Especially when stuffs are quite cheap there.  For those in Singapore, Myeongdong is basically a upgrade and a much much bigger version of Bugis Street."
5519,5.0,Endless shops selling similar stuff. Have more stuff for women than men. If you are not someone who likes hanging out while the ladies shop.. dont bother going here as it only tires you.. Some of the so called designer wear looked impressive. However cant claim that things are cheap.
5520,5.0,"I can say this is the best place for shopping in Seoul.. You can find everything in here.. From food until clothes.. The best part is, CHEAP!! Love being here.. :)"

5522,5.0,"When one visits SEoul, this is really the place to visit and stay. We always stay here because of the convenience of moving around Seoul, the good and variety of food that can be found and of course it is truly a shopping paradise!"
5523,5.0,Here is shopping heaven to the gals! You will see the promoters all shouting and ask you to visit their shops. They will also give you free samples in order to attract you to stop and go in :) but it's definitely no regret to step in the shops! So much of choices and CHEAPPP!!
5524,4.0,Nice area to walk through. Lots of lights. Very lively with shopping in the stores as well as on the streets. There were many skin/cosmetic stores. Difficult to buy because I was not familiar with most of the Korean brands and most didn't speak english.
5525,5.0,"All the good items are here in Myeongdong. Not too pricey, nice cloths & other items that you can choose.  After Shoping you may want to see the Myungbo Art Hall, along Myeongdong. A very unique show of art that you'll really enjoy ( at first, i thought it's a waste of time but it's not). We'll surely see this again!"
5526,5.0,"You can find everything here. Who needs to shop elsewhere. Heaps of fashion, beauty, and food. Make sure you have cash in order to get discounts ( stores will not give discounts for card because they lose 10% to the card company. But if you pay cash, they will give you the 10% off, and maybe a little bit more depending on how good you are at bargaining).  I find the sales people at clothing stores to be extremely pushy which I don't like. But there is so much fashionable stuff here that you can put up with some attitude."
5527,5.0,"Every city in the world has an area where it is all happening with shopping and dining. Myeongdong fits the bill as the most hip place for everyone, local and tourist all love this place, also regardless of age too. This place starts to come alive around 11am and lasts up to pass 11pm, the only place that can rival it is Dongdeamun, but that's another story.  Come here to see the newest trends, see all the fashion shops and cosmetic houses, numerous famous restaurants, souvenir stores...etc. It is a great place to do all the shopping in an hour or two, or more if you are really strong.  For a bit of natural relief, one could get to the Namsan N tower, which isn't far away, or see the famous Myeongdong church. This place really is the top choice for seeing the new faces of Korea."
5528,4.0,"Fun shopping experience day or night (we stayed for both) and we found plenty to look at from high fashion to cheap stuff. It winds around and around, so try to keep your bearings.  The 4 metro station drops you right in the heart of it, or you can come at it from Seoul station and walk. Lots in the area if you're looking to wander as well."
5529,4.0,"We were intend to take subway at Myeongdong station after coming down from N Seoul Tower.We walked from Namsan cable station about 10min then we arrived at Myeongdong shopping district. The most famous attraction regarding Myeongdong is the skin care & cosmetic product.There are so many brands of skin care product.Got a lot of sales girls standing outside the shop to attract the customers.Their service is very good.The very long street most of it selling skin care product. We came evening time that is the peak hour,so there were so crowding along the street.I bought hand creams here,the price is reasonable,with a lot of samples,FOC....The currency exchange rate here is better than any other place,the owner of our hostel told us so.After we came here and doing some research,we found its true."
5530,4.0,"just got back from Myeongdong - took subway Line 4 from Sinnohyeon. I went there to buy Tony Moly skin care (BB cream, CC cream and Hydro gel mask), I also got samples along the way. There are very good street food (cupcake with egg, scalloped french fries, grilled octopus), It is a fun place to shop for Korean skin care, eat street food and experience the atmosphere.  you should try it"
5531,4.0,"There are lot's of things to see (and buy) here, especially for those who are into asian fashion-think japan pop. Size are limited so travellers from europe or america might have problem fitting into the selections.  Price wise it's not expensive say compare to China (not knock offs) but the quality is not very good. Buttons fell off after awhile. Shop wisely.."
5532,3.0,"Myeongdong is crowded day and night. Lots of shopping, but many of the same stores block after block. There are like 4 Etude makeup stores in the neighborhood. Mostly stores for teens and 20-somethings. Don't eat in this neighborhood, most of the restaurants are not good. We stayed in the area and ate around here 4 times and were disappointed with all but one, a Korean chicken soup and dumpling restaurant that seemed very popular and was recommended by our hotel. Highly recommend Hara Donuts though!"
5533,4.0,"Myeongdong is really a shopper's haven. A lot of shops to choose from and you can get items at a discounted price. Shops like forever 21, rabeanco, uniqlo, and most Korean cosmetic brands can be found here. There's not much to see here. But this shopping district is really exciting and full of action at night with all the light and people. Another place you can enjoy if you like people watching and shopping."
5534,5.0,Everything cheap and pretty. My mum bought so many things. The people are beautiful and the shop ladies and boys are friendly. Nothing to lose shopping here

5536,5.0,"Well, there are many good korean food to try out! You should the korean Hot Dog's or visit the great korean restaurant ( We went there twice, because the it was so yummy). In addition are there many cute shops. You can buy nearly every thing, from tea, to 'Gangnam Style' socks. It is near gyeongbokgung so you can combine both very well."
5537,5.0,"Every night we went browsing in this bustling market place, the locals are very polite and happy. Very clean and colourful market. But the stalls sell food that an English/Australian stomach may not suit,...very spicy. Right at the end of the street is a big shop that has a karaoke competion where anyone from the street can step up. The teenagers Girls and Boys made fun of themselves and everyone loved it. They didnt take themselves too serious."
5538,4.0,"if you want to buy a branded items in Seoul, then Myeongdong its the right place, there was Grand Korea 2013 sale in winter time, don't miss it, you will get your favorit items in great discount"
5539,3.0,"Very easy to find location - next to the exit of MTR. Almost every hot brands in Seoul got a branch here. This is a good place to know what's popular in the Seoul market. However, it only refers to those big brands. If you stay longer, you would find two or more branches of same brands there. Too commercial."
5540,4.0,"This echoes what many of the other Reviewers have said: the Myeong-dong shopping district is bright, busy, colorful, crowded and completely insane. I was in Seoul in January/early February but even in the middle of Winter, the streets were packed with shoppers -- locals and tourists alike -- in bulky coats, most carrying heavy shopping bags in both hands. If you like cosmetics and skin care products, Myeong-dong will have your adrenalin running on overdrive. Every Korean cosmetic brand has not one, but several shops within a few meters of each other. Business is brisk but highly competitive. Each cosmetic store posts one or two sales ladies at the front, who offer free product samples to entice passers-by to enter the store. Aside from skincare shops, mid-range clothing brands are also represented with flagship store-sized branches of Uniqlo, Zara, Mango, H&M, and Forever 21 planted in between the cosmetic shops, hotels and restaurants. When the sun sets, it gets even more frenetic. Food carts selling all kinds of snacks (Korean mandoo dumplings, grilled squid, chicken skewers) cooked on-the-spot, in many cases, appear at every block. I'd say some of the better meals I've had, have been from the food carts at Myeong-dong. There are numerous proper restaurant options in the area, including the famous porridge shop called Migabon. What I really liked about this area is that there were Seoul Tourism volunteers posted at key intersections to provide information and help out tourists with directions. Just look for the folks wearing bright red coats and an ""i"" (for information) patch."
5541,3.0,Nice to shop especially when you're so into cosmetics and beauty products and skin care.only thing is that the mall is too crowded which causes inconvenience to shop. Prices are quite reasonable when there are sales
5542,4.0,"Myeong dong use to be a shopping and entertainment district, lots of youngsters hangout there. It's now seems to be a faded glory.i recommend to go to Hongda instead. It's an university district, Full of restaurants, bar, cafe, shoes boutique, clothing shops, mobile shops, many youngsters like to go there, grab a coffee in one of the funky cafe joint, you can easily spend one nice evening in Hongda."
5543,4.0,So much going on this area. However there is no toy store in this area. All Cosmetics or Fashion. If you look closely some store give quite a good discount or do a surprise discount.. so watch out !!
5544,4.0,"The other reviews have adequately described the feel of this place, and listed the global brands found here. This is more about those little bits that stressed me out while shopping.  I am bored by H&M, and go to Uniqlo for utility wear, so I was in the market for something different.  1. I didn't think my inability to speak Korean was a handicap until I went here. I wanted to buy clothes and make-up, and just found it awkward explaining what I wanted, maybe because I'm not the type who's 100% sure of what I want. I need a little bit of sales talk, but hard sell is intimidating.  You have to be assertive to get the shop ladies to tell you if they have your size, or even just to interrupt them while they are gossiping so you can buy that dress. I swear, to this day I regret not buying a dress at Migliore because I wasn't sure I could cut in on two ahjummas in discussion.  The make-up shopping experience is another thing. I don't use make-up, but wanted to buy some products for my secretary and a friend's teenager. Almost every corner has the same make-up stores, so it can make you gag after a while. Oh, the salesgirls are really pushy -- they will call your attention while you're walking and try to get you to buy. But when I actually did follow a salesgirl into a store, and the time came for me to explain what I wanted, the salesgirls kind of clammed up. I guess it's hard to give the usual sales talk if you can't talk to the buyer. I did manage to buy some products, plus get loads of freebies, but I wouldn't be able to explain what the benefits of each item that I bought. It could really have been snake oil, but I paid for it.  2. For some reason, the bar code sticker on an item that I paid for in one store triggered the door alarm as I was about to leave a completely different store. Thief! Fearful of being tackled to the ground, I went back in to look for a manager to look through my bags and establish that I didn't take anything without paying. That was a bit hard to explain to the salesclerk that I approached; stranger still was that no one actually approached me to do the check on my stuff. Eventually a manager was found; each item was scanned until the culprit was identified and disarmed. I am so glad it was an item that couldn't be found in that store. Otherwise, yikes. This experience has left me wary of those door alarm things. I now have an annoying habit of walking slowly past those things just in case the alarm goes off, if only to establish that I am not shoplifting. Groan.  3. As for eating, Myeongdong is famous for kalguksu, but I Googled that and found out that I was allergic to some seafood in the broth. Research on where to eat. There are plenty of food places, but I ended up at McDonald's.  I will come back -- maybe it's better experienced when shopping with friends instead of alone. I make it a point to live near Myeongdong because it's still a great place, notwithstanding the stuff I just said above. I can't imagine living anywhere else while on holiday."
5545,4.0,This area is likely to sell almost branded and expensive products. Not so many things you can bargain to buy it since almost all products are sell in the concrete building.What I can see are some stalls selling foods in the middle of walking street.
5546,5.0,Lots of stuff are available within the 1 place. CDs are cheap. Full of street snacks which offers a wide varieties of typical korean snacks.
5547,4.0,"this is definitely a tourist friendly location. Most the shops (cloth, accessories, cosmetics) people can speak multiple languages. They start in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese. This is to cater all the popular tourists destination. Also the fun fact is that cosmetics shops give up free samples at the door to lure people to step in to see their products. overall, you can spend a day here."
5548,4.0,"You can literally buy anything here. The area is huge that the first stop is the accessories and the next is the fashion area. If you like to shop, then this is the place for you.

5553,4.0,"This place is huge and crowded, even during the winter. There is tons of shopping, entertainment, and food. It's fun to walk around to all of the food vendors and try everything out, especially if you are a foreigner. It will take you most of a day to navigate around this area because there is so much to do and see. I think it's a must for anyone vacationing in Seoul."
5554,4.0,Lots of people at night and if you go during day time I think most street stalls are not open yet. However I think you should go to Insadong as well!
5555,5.0,"Keep your won close to you. Myeongdong has retail (upstairs) and discount (underground) so take your time shopping. Some of the underground vendors do not have prices, so (to me) this means negotiate, negotiate, negotiate. Lots of great bargains and places to people watch. Do it!"
5556,5.0,"A must visit shopping district. If you've read blogs about trips to Korea this is definitely one of the highlights. And they are definitely RIGHT. I enjoyed roaming the streets of Myeongdong on our last day in Seoul and definitely got good stuff there. But not really when it's winter..haha Therefore, I'm definitely going back there for a summer season trip.."

My family spent a few days in Sejong Hotel, which was just renovated last year and a very convenient and nice hotel. We were walking around the streets in Myeongdong area, shopping and eating there. There are a great variety of shops for young guys and family, including casual wear, formal suits, jackets, and beauty goods for family, and also coffee shops and Korean food."
5558,5.0,"I love Myeongdong for all the fashion and beauty shops! Everywhere you turn, you can find the trusty Korean beauty shops like Etude House, Skin Food, Missha and The Face Shop. Fashion biggies like H&M and Forever 21 are also found here. Try to sample one of the many Korean BBQ restaurants in the area."
5559,5.0,"The atmosphere of this place is buzzing and there are so many things to see or buy amongst the huge crowd of mostly young people. There are a lot of places to shop at or explore and the prices are reasonable. Food stalls line the middle of the street selling cheap stuff like chicken, fried potato, squid, etc and other stalls selling reasonably priced clothes. Pictures of Korean celebrities are posted almost everywhere from the billboards overhead to the shopfront of the many Misha, Tony Moly, Nature Republic cosmetic stores. While you're there, look for a place selling frozen yoghurt and for around 3000 won you get a huge serving on a cone."
5560,5.0,This was beside our hotel... It was an awesome shopping place. I was able to find winter clothes we badly needed last month. I didn't realize it was that cold in the city. The price was surprisingly affordable too... :-)
5561,3.0,"Able to find good deal inside the shopping mall. If you are bored of the shopping mall, around the corner there are a few shopping mall for you to explore."
5562,3.0,"Had some good deals on clothes needed last minute due to luggage issues at the airport. Streets were packed, but relatively short walk from the hotel."
5563,5.0,"endless shops selling all sorts of stuff mostly fashion items like clothes, shoes, accesories, bags and etc love love love them there restaurants too where we had our dinner i am strolling at this street every night before going back to my hotel if youre lucky..you can watch the performance on a stage at the entrance of this street...a very k-pop performance.. its a must visit place in seoul"
5564,5.0,This place has great shopping that stays open all night long. Shops actually have weird store hours on Mondays. I think they are closed until 6pm and open all night.
5565,3.0,"Good for ppl who want to do shopping for everything at one place, especially cosmetics, they have The Face Shop, Nature Republics, It's Skin, etcs. are all there, and you could even find the same brand has more than 3 shops on the same road, and also some other Japanese shops(full of Japanese customers...). Honestly i think it's quite similar to Busan shopping street, and all shopping centers in the world, shops are on 2 sides of road next to each other, the path is narrow, coffee shops and Lotteria fast food rest. could be found there also. people are everywhere by weekends. apart from cosmetics,they also sell little stuff, gifts, clothes, bags, etc.,but more than half are imported goods. we only walked for 20min then spent another 2hours in coffee shops. if for shopping, at least 2hours. Myeongdong is also renowned for restaurants but we didnt go to any. street food looks tasty. if you are interested in cosmetics shopping or want to experience business shopping street then try myeongdong, for other purposes, there are many better places in Seoul to visit. :-)"
5566,2.0,15 million hyper juvenile female Korean shoppers grooving to the ultra low prices for junk. What a rush for men!
5567,5.0,"You'll get great deals with cosmetics (Face Shop, Etude, Missha etc) All stores are always on sale. I always didn't notice that I've been shopping from morning till 11:00am... Lotte Department store is expensive though than their Duty Free Shops and other stores in Myeondong."
5568,3.0,"Too much shopping to do, could spend the whole day here if the wallet permits. Only drawback is that most of the shops are selling the same items. During winter, you see most shops selling winter apparels."
5569,5.0,Shops started to opened from 10am onwards. Lots of eateries and shops .... Much more happening during night time when the night market starts ...
5570,4.0,Busy area but most shops seems to sell similar things. 20% of the shops sell cosmetic. Many food choices at great price too.
5571,3.0,Nothing much to see plus was too crowded. Definitely not the place to go during winter. We were too busy trying to hide in shops and cafes due to the cold. You can find most of the big name shops in any other cities as well.
5572,5.0,"This is a fun and exciting area to stroll around. Whether you are shopping or dining or just walking around, it is a comfortable and relaxing experience. But be warned it can be very busy at times, with many locals shopping and eating out especially after work, but still I love this area and always love walking around and finding different places to eat. The beautiful Myeongdong Theatre is located here as well as the Nantra Cooking Show, which is not at the Myeongdong Theatre but in the UNESCO building. Easiest directions for reaching the Myeongdong Shopping area is if you are standing in front of the Lotte Department Store, look to your right and across the street and you will see the Archway entrance. You must go down under the street to reach it. This is also a huge underground shopping area, but once upstairs, you will be at the entrance. There is every conceivable store for shopping and every possible ethnicity of restaurants. From expensive to cheap.. If the weather is warm, expect to see many outside shops and stalls serving all kinds of foods, drinks, ice cream and snacks. If at night, you will be amazed at the different colors of bright lights advertising stores and restaurants."
5573,5.0,And great street food! Fantastic place for shopaholics! The streets are filled with cosmetic shops and clothes and street food stalls. Probably the best place to shop in Seoul.
5574,5.0,"Anything you want from branded stuff to round of the mill stuff is here. The prices are reasonable too...I was told the prices of the branded stuff (Channel/Gucci etc) were comparable to Paris.. Surprise surprise....  The street food sold here are a MUST try for visitors.....It all differs from being pungent, salty, sweet, spicy, sea-weedy, stinky (to some people). Whereever you come from, it will be a great palate experience...."
5575,4.0,"Think cattle farm. Massive amounts of people all rushing around. Pretty neat, but certainly wouldn't want to head into area again. Way to many people for my liking."
5576,4.0,Love the shopping and the street food! But do expect huge crowd at some places or even on the streets! It's easy to navigate around the area too!
5577,5.0,"Yummy. And Pizza Hut but not pizza like we are used to in the States. Lots of vendors set up w jewelry and hats, gloves, etc."
5578,5.0,"I've been living in Seoul for four months and I go to Myeongdong three times a week. I lived on campus (Dongguk) and it is a 15-20 minutes walk from here to Myeongdong, so if I wan to eat something I'll go there. I recommend ""Rimini"" to have lunch or dinner in Myeongdong! It's an Italian restaurant, but one of the best where you have good food for reasonable prices. Since I'm a girl I love shopping! During the weekends it's very crowded in the streets, but also at nights when the street stalls come out and settle down in the street, so that means that the street will become narrower. Anyways there are lots of Korean local clothing shops, but also brands as Forever21, Zara, Mango, H&M, etc. If you are Asian and you have size S Korean shops are a must for you! Though this is ""Asian S"". It's kind of different. Koreans are slim and not that tall comparing with Europeans or Americans... But you still can enjoy other shops. Oh yeah, there are lots of women screaming and waving with their samples in front of their stores. Hehe, very annoying, just ignore the lady. :-)"
5579,3.0,"This must-visit shopping district is littered with standalone shops and multi-storey malls. You will find a lot of tourists and many good looking/fashionable people here. Cafes are abundant too. In short, the atmosphere is great.  I love the stuff on heavy discounts at H&M. My only grouse is that there are too many duplicate shops selling the same cosmetics. Every corner you turn, you will bound to see either Faceshop, Skinfood, Etude.... etc. It's like they own this town. I wonder whether they are related....."
5580,4.0,"Lots of big department stores, shops and foodstalls. Very busy traffic around this area, lots of people around. easy to find money exchange shops, banks."
5581,5.0,"This place is crazy! I've never seen a shopping area so full, then again, I did go right before Christmas, but based on the other reviews it seems like it's always like that.  The only place in Korea you will find Forever 21 and, as far as I know, Red Mango!"
5582,5.0,I love it here...the shopping possibilities are endless...and the street food is cheap and delicious!
5583,5.0,"We've been going to this shopping area for the past two years since we've gotten to Korea. It's a very big area and there's outdoor walking and going in and out of stores as well as indoor department store shopping. It's usually very busy and filled with a lot of people, but the business doesn't take away from the fun and feeling of the area. There's also a lot of different types of food to eat around the area"
5584,3.0,"Rumor has it that end of days is on 21 December...here we are in myeongdong shopping after our 2days ski trip in Alpensia. We are from Singapore, the hot tropic, so the winter shopping is not very exciting for us. Every boutiques here are selling winter clothing (even the shoes are not those which will suit the hot weather back home). But I must say I am very pleased with my choice hotel Ibis Ambassador which is right next to Myeongdong shopping district. There are so many Korean cosmetics stores & local fashion brands all located in this district. We are so very pleased to be greeted by snow while we are shopping ( we did not get to experience snow falling from the sky even when we are in Alpensia, snow is already 2 feet deep when we get there...no idea how the snow get there too). Anyway, I still get to buy bags of Laneige & Faceshop products enough to last me a few months, so shopping is still goooodd!!!"
5585,4.0,"If you are in Seoul, and love beauty products - you MUST visit Myeongdong. The number of shops selling beauty products (especially masks!) is just astounding! You'll find the same company in more than one shop in this area.. one at the start of a street, and one at another.  Buy face masks here - a reasonably good brand like Nature Republic, Faceshop etc - will have face masks selling at about USD 0.70 each (in packs of ten) - which is 20% of the price it's sold in their shops Malaysia! Excellent as souvenirs.  There are so many beauty product shops - competition is stiff - and consumers benefit - because shops will give out samples, and you can use the tester products. Don't be shy to ask for more samples when you purchase products (especially if you buy a lot), most shops will oblige.  Souvenirs sold at Myeongdong are also cheaper than those sold at Insadong. I would recommend buying socks! if you are a fan of the Korean instant noodles, Shin Ramun - you can get Shin Ramun socks here.  There's also street food, stalls selling bags, clothes at very reasonable prices."
5586,5.0,"It's nice to snack and shop in this area. From your Kpop stuff (not authentic of course!) to winter hats, scarves to doebuki and grilled cuttlefish, this is the place to be till late at night.  Beware tho! Do not buy the DVDs. No guarantee of English subtitles regardless of what they convince you!"
5587,5.0,"I enjoyed shopping here. Lots of discounts and freebies in almost every store. It's a must for shoppers! Some of the stores here are Uniqlo, Zara, Forever21, Nike, Adidas, New Balance, Pancoat (i love Pancoat!), make up shops and more. There are also good korean and western restaurants in every corner. Also, don't miss the Myeongdong Cathedral, the structure is pretty awesome. =)  If you don't like shopping in very crowded places or hate to be dragged by your girl in every store, this is not for you. Girls will definitely go crazy here, entering store ever store hahah! My brother regretted coming with me and our lady friend. =P"
5588,4.0,"Things aren't all that cheap over here, but it's great for cosmetics and facial products. There's perpetually a crowd all times of the day!"
5589,4.0,"I'm not that fussed about shopping to be honest so at first my husband and I were walking around and just seeing the same things - cosmetics and the like. However, we then saw a sign for a cat cafe and my husband didn't believe me that they had cats inside. They did and it was amazing! You can play and feed the cats and watch them play with each other, it's awesome. We went back later in the week and went to a dog cafe which was insane. The dogs were really fun and if you sit on the floor they love to curl up in your lap. We went to a different cat cafe after which was different to the first but just as good. Highly recommend Myeongdong if you are into animals."
5590,3.0,"Very interesting place to visit. Be sure to go back at night. Lots of cosmetic and clothing stores, but very high pressure sales by the salespersons in front of the store."
5591,5.0,"It's ALWAYS packed with people, but there's a reason for this: this area is like a shopping district for the all those shopaholics in the world: there's everything you can wish for and more, but all of it in a neighborhood setting, complete with cute themed coffee shops (i.e. cat coffee shops, doggy coffee shops: where it's filled with actual dogs and cats running wild!) and restos and SO much more! Must go experience it to believe it!"
5592,5.0,"We enjoyed shopping here and especially when you like skin care and cosmetic products because every where you look there will always a boutique for skin care and cosmetics,I was impress with the Korean ladies skin they are flawless. A lot of shops from clothes to super market, everything you need is here and the best part was the price was very cheap compare to my country.one day is not enough to walk all around the shops, I'm so in heaven. Theres a lot of restaurants and fast food too, the food is spicy but delicious and it's a reasonable price, especially Korean BBQ!!! If I have a chance to go back to Korea I will definitely go back here!"
5593,5.0,"One of the best places to shop anywhere in Asia/Globe..so much of variety of almost everything esp. Cosmetics/clothes/shoes etc. Lovely walking streets..cafes..street food is amazing..missing the place so much..S.Korea is a must visit and love the people – so helpful,polite,well spoken, cultured…hope to visit soon again in summers..Myeongdong sure would make all girls go crazy."
5594,5.0,"All the skincare and cosmetic products you want to buy is here! And there are so many shops. Each time you buy, they will give you some product samples, most of the time, even before you went into the shop! There is also a lot of street stores and food carts and cafes and restaurants. There are several money changer here, and as far as SGD goes, the rates are pretty good. Very near 2 subways, its quite accessible. Nanta theater is also here. So you can probably watch the cheaper 11am show, then proceed with your shopping!"
5595,5.0,"Myeongdong is a lot of fun...there's something for everyone here! Branded clothing, sportswear, locally made ""fob"" clothing, and of course tons & tons of cosmetics and accessories for the girls! Lots of affordable food, albeit mostly Asian/Korean, and cafes including cat & dog cafes! Just note that stores do not open until about 11am and it does not get too busy until late afternoon. Make sure to check out the area after dark as that's when all the stalls are set up and you get to try the awesome street food and haggle some nice bargains with the vendors! Gotta love Asia!"
5596,4.0,"The place is home to mid-priced local and international brands but one of the highlights would be shopping for cosmetics and skincare products in Etude House, Face Shop, Tony Moly, Holika Holika, Nature Republic, Skin Food, etc. There is a cosmetic store every few steps. Store personnel often hand out free samples to entice customers."
5597,5.0,Mega shopping area in Seoul...seemingly endless streets and side streets of shopping that you can't get enough of. Push carts line up in the middle of the street to provide more variety that you can't get enough of
5598,4.0,We were there 3 times during our short 8 days trip to Koera. it was very cold at night but business as usual for the shops. You can practically buy anything from branded to local stuffs. It's a cosmetic heaven as there are so many brands available (many store have many outlets there).
5599,4.0,"We went there after a Church Service on a Sunday morning and it started out quite ok, with loads of shopping places to visit, and street food... but after lunch, the place got more crowded and within a few hours we didn't feel like shopping so much..."
5600,4.0,"The area is alive from early morning to late evening. If you don't want to shop, you can just walk around and people watch!"
5601,5.0,I loved shopping the streets at Myeongdong for its variety. The shopping malls were also great in its selections!
5602,5.0,"With large selection of discount outlets selling products at low prices especially cosmetics, accessories & clothing."
5603,3.0,"this is a place for shoppers and woman.you can buy a lot of skin care products. if you are faceshop, skin77, skinfood and etude house lovers, you can shop a lot of products here but those products can be buy at others places too.the prices for all cosmetic products are standard. the only benefits here is you can get almost all general cosmetic products without needed to search anywhere."
5604,4.0,"A must to go place for shopaholic though it gets very crowded on weekends. Good bargains on home grown beauty products like Face Shop, Etude House, Nature Republic etc"
5605,3.0,"It seems like each Korean skincare brand has at least 20 outlets in the area. It just gets too repetitive in terms of tenant mix. There are a few interesting shops, but you really have to screen through all the repetitive skincare shops and tourist traps very patiently to find them. Good luck."
5606,3.0,"If you're a cosmetic lovers ,no need to go another place because all are here! Just a short walk to the Seoul Tower from here."
5607,4.0,"lot of animation, great store all different from each other, and above all, very good view of the Korean fashion style !!!!!!"
5608,4.0,"Myeongdong comes alive at night with all the street food vendors lined up in the middle of the streets. Be sure to check them out! Cheap and delicious food. It's a cosmetic and skincare haven. You can find many Korean skincare brands and there is bound to be one at every alley. Other than the bigger main streets for more well-known international brands, go to the small alleys for some fashion by the Koreans! I didn't get to walk through the whole of Myeongdong, it's huge! Allocate more time for it when you're in Seoul!"
5609,4.0,"A great place if you want to go shopping : there are clothes shops, beauty shops, CD shops, etc... However it is not the best place if you're looking for cheap items !"
5610,4.0,"This is the place to be for korean shopping!!! local brands with very affordable price and high quality goods. forget about the bargains in south gate and dongdaemun this is the hippest place! My advise book a hotel in savoy, skyparkhotel 1 make sure its near spao store or Ibis hotel you are right smack in myeongong area!!!"
5611,5.0,"This shopping district is filled with life! Music, voices and smell of food is every where! Best time to visit around evening when road side stalls open!  Comestics all going cheaper than those selling in Singapore. Beautiful bags, shoes going at 10,000won Shoes sizes are kinda small, the biggest size for female is 250mm, about uk5.5  Not much sale of clothes here though.  And if you are there and a cats' lover, please please visit their Cat's cafe!! And if you are a dogs' lover, visit their Dog's cafe too :)"
5612,3.0,"Myeongdong was ok. A lively and bustling area especially at night (good place to try street food, too), but if you're looking to shop for clothes and cosmetics, check out the area at Ewha Women's University first (subway stop: Edae/Ewha Women's University on the green line) before going to Myeongdong. Everything's cheaper there as it's all student-friendly prices! That's what I did, and when I got to Myeongdong, I didn't feel like buying anything anymore."
5613,5.0,"my friends and I loved Myeongdong! We visited the place everyday during our 12 day trip since it was just 5 mins away from our hotel. Even though it was sooo crowded and hectic, if you need to do cosmetic or accessories shopping, this is the place to be! There are also guides in red vests that help you if you have any questions as to where everything is or if you simply need to get a map from them. Myeongdong is HUGE, so it can get tiring, so multiple trips is a must if you need to complete your shopping. They also have tons of restaurants and coffee shops if you get hungry while shopping. So, if you're a shopaholic, this place is definitely for you...if you're not, it's still worth a visit during your trip!"
5614,4.0,"I dropped by in September, curiosity didn't kill me. I got free samples of masks including the one that has the snail's slime! Has yet to try it. And ended up buying some items here and there, then realized that they were so much cheaper than the same ones back home. Even if you're not into beauty products, which I wasn't, it's a good experience to see the numerous brand shops available in 1 area. Skin food, Etude, Nature Republic etc.., you'll not miss them, you'll see them anywhere. And there are hawkers selling cute socks, jackets etc..although I the socks were more expensive than the ones I got in the underground malls, they were still cheaper than back home. My daughters love them. Wish I had bought more."
5615,5.0,"great buys, lots of items to choose from high end to bargain sales. Lotte Department store is just across the street were high end items are all available."
5616,5.0,"Besides the department stores, there are so many Korean cosmetics stores such as Nature Republic, The Face Shop, Skin Food, Etude etc. there are also many street vendors selling snacks to all kinds of goods. Many people expecially young Korean couples around. Me and my girls just can't stop buying the cosmetics product since the price is so cheap compared to our place.Even if you are not into shopping, just be there to watch the happenings!"
5617,2.0,"Myeongdong was highly recommended. When I stepped into Myeongdong, I was impressed with the number of shops initially. But on closer inspection, I found it baffling to find the same brand a few meters away. So I made a hasty retreat for some place else that has a better shopping experience."
5618,4.0,"Ladies, buy your cosmetics and skin care here. Service is much better and u get loads of freebies. You can still pick up some at the airport duty free but choices are limited , service bad and no freebies. For eg, the Laneigh snow bb cream cushion is not available at airport! Shops start closing around 10.30pm. There are street food, cafe and restaurant all over. Bring lots of cash and credit card."
5619,5.0,"The street starts from the exit of the subway station. there are many good stores on the left and right side of the street. The smell of barbequed octopus or local delicacy fill up the air. Shopping is good for all kind of budget,bw it a high end boutique or vendors at the stalls that lined up at the center of the roads. Love this place......"
5620,5.0,"Although Myeongdong is very touristy and crowded, I really liked my time there. There are so many things to see and buy. The street food are also very nice. You should try the long unhealthy fried potato twist but I recommend sharing it with someone, one stick for me was a bit too much. Otherwise, there are lots of restaurants and coffee shops. Check out the stall vendors too that sell electronic accessories, souvenirs, cheap jewellry, etc.."
5621,5.0,"This shopping complex has all the expensive european signature brands housed in Arcade fashion and locally made inexpensive goods such as bags, shoes, clothing, etc being sold in street stalls. Food stalls are also plentiful serving all kinds of street food. American& European Food Chains are also present here. Its all in an area the size of the Makati CBD."
5622,4.0,"I spend like half month's salary there because there was a sale going on at that time. one piece of advice, bring more cash or make sure your credit card works :)"
5623,5.0,Myeongdong is excellent area for shopping for everything from clothes to cosmetics. They are also key international shops like H&M and Forever 21.
5624,5.0,Myeongdong is a modern shopping area with hundreds of shops of both local South Korean brands as well as international brands. Many cafes and restaurants as well as the famous Nanta theater show is located here. We tried out the Korean pastries in one of the bakeries and sat down on a bench while watching the young locals pass us by. At night the food carts come in selling different local foods that people snack on while walking. If you have only one chance to go shopping in Seoul this is where you should go.
5625,3.0,"Get all your Korean beauty products here. All the shops have staff that can speak Mandarin. Also, U can get tax rebates here. If U wanna avoid the crowd, check out the beautiful Catholic Church at night. Approach any of the Guides in Red Jackets on the streets if U r lost. They are usually stationed right smack in the middle of Myeongdong where the Myeongdong Theater is."
5626,4.0,"The Myeong-Dong area is a modern shopping area with all the popular brands one can find in all western shopping malls. It's a nice area to walk around day and night, has some good restaurants and fast food, and a good atmosphere. Unfortunately, prices are very high to western travelers, I would estimate at least 10% higher than in (expensive) European cities and moch more than in the US."
5627,4.0,"Myeongdong is a vibrant shopping area with Korean cosmetic shops and Korean fashion, bags and clothes all lined up. There are also international brands such as Forever 21, Zara, Uniqlo, Ralph Lauren, Aldo, etc. There also Korean food and international fast food joints around the vicinity. We went there at 9 PM and the streets were full given it is a working Monday. The shops are full of locals as well.  I bought loads of BB cream! LOL. The streets are lined with cosmetic shops literally at every corner - Missha, Etude House, Skin Food, Nature Republic, etc. There are also shops selling Bags and accessories. A really nice place to shop. Shops are accepting credit card payments as well but prepare some cash for street vendors of accessories and street foods."
5628,5.0,"You will enjoy walking around this area especially when night falls lots of lighting, street foods, shopping. But things may not be cheap here can bargain but not much"
5629,2.0,"This place was a bit of a letdown during my three days in Seoul after what I read about the place.  It had the usual high-end stores and the flashy neon lights. But there's nothing quirky about the place. No street performers, no people in weird costumes and nothing particularly unique, original or beautiful. It's just a straight up place to shop that you'd find elsewhere in Seoul and in most large Asian cities. It doesn't deserve its reputation for being the ""most see"" place in Seoul.  Maybe it's good for the ladies who love shopping. But as a guy, I found it nothing more than a decent photo opportunity."
5630,4.0,"Just a tip, go here at night!! There are street stalls at night which are selling lot of stuff. You can find also street food stalls in the area. Indeed a cool place to shop especially bags and beauty products. We bought more than 10 bags for only 10000 won each! And also we bought facial masks and Missha bb creams for a cheap price. Missha bb creams are almost only half of the prices here in our country plus they give so many freebies!! Loving this place!  My favorite place in Seoul!! If we get back in Seoul, Myeongdong is in our top list!! yay!  PS: hungry? try Yoogane restaurant! They sell authentic Korean food. We really love their fried rice. How good? We ate 4 times there for our dinner. hehe.. =)"
5631,5.0,"Actually, after peeking around Seoul, you'll find that everything is concentrated in this area, from morning untill 10:30 night: Shopping, shopping, shopping... coffee, restaurants, Korean goods, massages, strollers and street foods, and 2 metro stations."
5632,2.0,"Why would I go to Seoul for Zara, Mango, and other store brands when I can get them in Tokyo, New York, Europe? 15 minutes in here and I was back to the Namdaemon Market for comparable items without the store brand label sewn on the product. However, if you don't have access to these Global store brands, go for it. Prices are reasonable. Expect crowds, particularly in the early evening."
5633,5.0,"Abstract of shopping. You can buy everything you need from here. My recomendation is cosmetics, all brands are there. Ask them for freebies like samples."
5634,5.0,The Uni qlo showroom is value for money in terms of quality and variety. Shinsegae is walking distance and so is the Namdaemun underground shopping distance
5635,4.0,"You will find a lot of the cosmetics shop along the street. Some even have 3-4 stores along the street and people will just call you and give you free gifts in order for you to enter their shops! Good place to collect free masks and cotton buds :D Anyway, have to be careful with your belongings! My friend lost her waller there ! The place was just too packed, on weekends!"
5636,5.0,"I spent a day here and I even still couldn't get enough! So many stores here! I bought everything here. From CDs, cosmetics, clothes, and my favorite artist's stuff! So many restaurants too. But in the end I ate in KFC cause my tongue didn't really match with korean food :D Many coffee shops too, in case you're too tired after shopping. The most important part is the cosmetic store. Too many! You can just choose anything you like. The price is all pretty good too. It's very easy to get here. Once you're in Myeongdong Station, you can just walk out through any exit and it will bring you to Myeongdong. Just prepare lot of money when you decide to go here. And believe me, one day is not enough!"
5637,5.0,"Everything you need to satisfy your shopping craze can be found here. From famous fashion brands, beauty products, discount shops and road side stalls you can get them here. And also tons of restaurants and coffee joints for you to hang around."
5638,5.0,"If you can only spend half day in Seoul, this is the must place you have to visit.  You can find all beauty brands on the streets or Lotte DFS. You can try the famous Korean food, e.g. grilled meat, ginseng chicken soup, or western fast food Starbucks, burger king here Local fashion shops SPAO or international chains, Zara, H&M, Forever 21 are all around. K pop shops are just situated inside Nature Republic!!! Nanta show is also available here.  It's like Harbour City/Tsim Sha Tsui in Hong Kong, Shinjuku in Tokyo, Orchard Road in Singapore."
5639,5.0,"I love Myeongdong. Nature republic is my favourite shop there, I also visit the music shop in the same building. As well as the good shopping there are brilliant eating place. A full and fun day out."
5640,4.0,"oh the things to buy! plenty of skin care + cosmetics shops here. they're really quite aggressive with many shops having one sales person outside trying to lure customers into the shops with free gifts. whether you buy anything or not, you are allowed to keep the free gift. i ended up having more free gifts than the things i actually bought. hahaha... some of the boutiques sells reallllly cheap clothes as low as 5000won. i'm not sure why but i managed to buy some =p i stay at this area and i was here everyday of my stay. if i ever come back to seoul this is one place i definitely will not miss."
5641,4.0,Lots of cosmetic stores and street vendors selling similar products. Be sure to eat the tall ice cream!
5642,5.0,"dizziying myeongdong! shopping, sale, make ups, food, clothing's, everything u name it! good restaurant there as well. worth the money spend"
5643,3.0,"I can imagine if you can shop all day, this area is perfectly for you. My wife did her shopping in about two to three hours, then we walked along different streets. There were so many people and you couldn't see both sides of the shops. Therefore there was no such thing as ""window shopping"". A lot of brands can be found in all other areas of Seuol rather than Myeongdon, why I have to be pushed around and watch my steps carefully. Relax!"
5644,4.0,"I'm not a shopper, so my trip to Myeongdong was more focused on getting a feel for the city. I wandered for a couple of hours through the streets, eyeing all of the various products - and people! It was a relatively crowded place with a lot of shopping for a wide variety of items and a mix of food here and there."
5645,4.0,Everything is here from the $2 Daiso to expensive name-brand shops! I love the vibrancy of this area with the little market kiosks and shops with so many knick-knacks! Lots of different types of food to try too!
5646,4.0,"Shopping in Korea can be fun, or not, but Myeongdon was quite interesting. It's mostly women's clothing shops and little stalls (I mean little, size of a bathroom stall). My wife had a good time browsing the latest Asian fashion and bought a few items. It was fun just to see the number of vendors in all the different buildings and so much clothing in one little area. It shouldn't be missed if you are into ladies fashion."
5647,5.0,"There's lots of shopping to do in Korea..from facial products to clothes, fashion accessories, bags etc. Prices might not be as cheap as Bangkok, but style and quality is on a different level."
5648,5.0,"What can I say? it's all here. everything you could have imagined putting in your suit case and bringing home is here. From major department store chains selling the finest quality luxury brands, to mom and pop shops selling high quality knock offs. Great resturaunts, food carts and everything in between, it's all here.  This place is so popular that they never completely close, Don't waste your time trying to be clever by trying to find an off day with lower volume because this district is jam packed 7 days a week. The good news is that all the stores, stalls, carts, and shops that make their living here are completely used to the maddening crowds and have perfectly adapted to it.  You will not have to wait any longer here for a meal to be served at a resturaunt or for someone to ring up your purchace as you would in any other shopping district in Seoul. It is really quite amazing to watch just how efficiant this place operates! it's multi tasking at a level you will never see back home..  In fact, this is a must see just for the experience alone, becase you have never seen anything like it before and likely won't again... Even if you don't spend a dime here it will be somthing you will never forget."
5649,4.0,"This location is teaming with shoppers and salespersons who enticed customers by hailing them from the street. Things are inexpensive and good. The ladies would want to visit the fully-packed Etube House for their cosmetics!. They said Obdo is good, but I say this is better in terms of lower prices and variety of mixtures and concoctions to beautify the female bodies and faces. And they give freebies too!  Opposite Myeongdong is also another popular shopping street - Shinchon Ladies Street beside the higher end Shinsegae Shopping Centre. But here it looks like more Chinese-made goods are put on sale. Still it is much cheaper than those sold at Dongdaemun.  So if you ask me for a good place to shop. These three places can keep you here for two days, hehehe!"
5650,4.0,"PSY's Gangnam style is blasting at night, and lots of neat food stands for cheap snacks or meals. Lots of shops and Lotte Department is a must-see to see how Koreans shop, especially at rush hour at the basement where you can grocery shop, or eat at stalls. South of this district you can walk up towards Namsan and N Seoul Tower."
5651,5.0,"i am a white 50+ woman, been there several times on my solo trips through Seoul. Last time i spent about 5 hrs browsing the crooked streets - bargaining, sipping free ginseng tea, talking to vendors (some of them speak English). I watched some kind of official police rade last time. I shoped with US $$ and with a C/C (some vendors have computerized shops)."
5652,5.0,"Amazing area for shopping: clothes, cosmetic, facial products, casual bags, scarf. Make sure you bargain. Good selection of restaurants and street food to sample. Don't miss out the Underground shopping area on your way to/from the subway station too!"
5653,4.0,"Cosmetics shops, clothes, bags, cool stuffs are all here. The price is slightly higher than Dongdaemun. For restaurants, there are always long queue especially for those well-known. If you do not have time, try some snacks all along the streets. Lotte duty free is here too! You can spend a whole day just at Myeongdong."
5654,3.0,"Lot of neon, expensive outlets, and fastfood joints. Wasn't impressed. Do visit the nearby underground shopping center (and take someone with you that speaks Korean preferably if you want to get the prices down)"
5655,5.0,"Full of shops, people, restaurants, people, noise, people, coffee places, people, madness and did I mention PEOPLE????"
5656,5.0,Very good place for woman who love the cosmetics. Get the discount voucher from Korean Tourism sites. It's worth it. You need to spend at least half a day in this place.
5657,4.0,I found this a fascinating place to people-watch rather than to shop. The area is too busy and there are too many shops and carts to go through. Rather stop at a coffee shop - we went to Dunkin Doughnuts and sat upstairs. This gave us a lovely view of the people and the fashions of Korea - so many stylish fashionable people. Forever 21 though was a popular choice with my daughters who told me the sale there was well worth the crowds!
5658,5.0,"So many shops for cosmetics, clothes, shoes, etc. Not to mention the night market. Basically every shop has staff who can speak Chinese, Japanese, and English."
5659,5.0,Myeongdong is truly a shoppers paradise. Bargains and sales galore at every corner. This place comes alive at night.
5660,5.0,You can by everything in a place with variety foods and nice environment. Do a little bit bargaining to have competitive price when you purchase anything.
5661,4.0,"I love love love Myeongdong as everything is there: H&M, Forever 21, Spao, Uniqlo, etc. to name a few. High end brands are just across the street when you go to Shinsegae or Lotte Department store. At night, it is always jampacked with people and there are food carts that sell street food."
5662,4.0,"Not everyone is a perfect size 6, so we found this area great as it catered for european sizes. So many shops to chose from this was a full on shopping day. We were thankful for the Starbucks coffee shop with air conditioning and free wifi at the end of a busy day. Easy to get to from the subway as well."
5663,4.0,Great shopping if youre on a budget. you can ask for discounts even at department stores. Make up and accessories overload.
5664,4.0,Love shopping at Myeongdong with all the cosmetic shop went crazy shopping there.  Every brand of costmetic is there and shopping there is always a very enjoying trip.
5665,4.0,"I had visited Korea last June 2012 with my best friend and cannot wait to visit this market since have very long lists for shopping. Over here you can find everything including clothes, shoes, handbags, accessories, and cosmetics. If you don't know where to spend money, recommended to visiting this area."
5666,4.0,Place to shop for all kinds of merchandise. This place is crowded and fashion shop along the street.All type of smelling when we pass by the street as there was restaurant. Trendy place but price is expensive. We recommend to do our shopping at Namdaemun and Dongdaemun where the price is reasonable. Dislike when we do shopping the sales girl can't speak in english and make difficult for us to bargin.
5667,2.0,"Extremely busy area with foul smelling food stalls. Seoul is no shopping place as most western brands are the same as back home, only far more expensive. If you want Korean brands go to the more quite areas as Insadong. If you do not like big crowds avoid Myeongdong area"
5668,5.0,"Perfect place to shop for Korean cosmetics... The place is trendy, filled with shops, boutiques, and street sellers... Exciting place..."
5669,4.0,"Myeongdong is shopping heaven for Seoulites and visitors alike. Visiting after work on Monday, there were tons of people having dinner at the restaurants and the rest shopping up a storm. Imagine how much more crowded this shopping precint will be on weekends and holidays.  What makes shopping in Myeongdong exciting is the coexistence of department stores like M Plaza and Milgiore, chain stores, boutiques and pushcart vendors. Fashion apparel and homegrown skincare/cosmetics are big business here, with salespeople shoving skincare samples - typically single use face mask sheets - into the palms passing females to entice them into their shops. Due to the intense competition among the stores they are happy to process VAT refund forms for purchases as low as ￦30,000. Credit cards are used widely but those who settle in cash are given a small freebie.  Metro access to either Myeongdong Station or to Euljiro il-ga Station Exit 6."
5670,5.0,From cosmetic to fashion to snacks. The place I loved best in Seoul! Prices are really affordable and they usually come with loads of freebies. You can walk down the same street everyday with more and more things to buy as gifts or for own. Best deals for shopaholics!
5671,4.0,You can find all kinds of shopping here especially facial products. Go at night and you can enjoy the night market as well
5672,2.0,One of the busiest places to shop. Lots of people and noise. Not very good quality in most places. Not worth the money. Be careful of your wallet. Pick pockets.
5673,5.0,"Of all the shopping districts, we found this to be the best. Dongdaemum sell textile, clothings, etc but this place has everything. There are beauty product shops, CD and DVD, Clothings, shoes and bags. The items are also more wearable as they will fit us. The korean size is very small. We find it very difficult to buy clothings in Korea. However, many of the bags are fake products so we did not buy any from the streets. We bought them at Lotte department store. Also better to buy make in korea stuff for a change than make in China stuff. Many of the shoes are made in China. So you need to check. We enjoy the shopping and eating along the streets here. There is even a theatre for stage shows within this area. Shop sales personnel speak English and many are from China and speak mandarin for the Chinese, Malaysian, Taiwanese tourists.  We keep going to this shopping district.;)"
5674,4.0,"Paradise for shopper but if local knows you're foreigner, they will up the price so you must bargin..there are alot of cometics shops in this area..etude, faceshop, missha..etc..."
5675,5.0,My wife shopped here 2 days in a row because many of the quality Korean products were on sale. I had to come in the evening to see for myself & was impressed.
5676,3.0,Good only for bargain hunters. Tend to be crowded and you need to know the area to find what you want to buy. Must bargain place but once you get your price you need to make the purchase or else you will get a very irritated vendor.
5677,5.0,"i stayed near this area so almost every day and night i spent in this area for shop. this is the best area so far to shop and dine, because this area is huge to choose the place for dining is easy. there are a lot of italian, korean and japanese rests in this area. and also, there are a lot of cosmetics, clothing shops as well (local shops and international brands). it took me 2 days to finished walking in this area. so huge but worth it."
5678,5.0,"This is one of my favorite areas of Seoul. For a quieter shopping experience, go during the day. There are some nice restaurants and lots of shops like Zara, H&M, and TONS of great beauty product stores. If you want more of an adventure, go in the evening, after 5 or 6 pm. The street vendors come out then and there are HORDES of Japanese tourists. It is very interesting. Very loud. But lots of good (and safe) street food. Don't expect any mega cheap bargains, but you can occasionally find a good deal on clothes or costume jewelry (usually in the shops, not from the street vendors)."
5679,5.0,"You can find everything from branded stuff, local designer and cheap crazy korean style. If you're looking for kpop idol stuff, you might need to go on a hawk eye mode to spot it because the place is so tiny but lots of lots of Kpop merchandise in it."
5680,5.0,"Staying in Myeongdong is definitely great. The shopping street is vast and it contains a diverse selection of stores for you to buy from. From the standard Faceshop to Etude House to many more... They will also give out free samples and try to entice you to go in and make purchases, Do remember to get Tax refund (>W30 000) receipt from them if not you will not get any. Food is easy to get also with the local eateries to MacDonalds there are plentiful there. Also to note that there are Travel Ambassador from Korean Tourism Board who are dressed in distinct Red uniform armed with maps etc to help those who are around. Happy shopping in Myeongdong."
5681,5.0,All kinds of restaurants and shops are here. You don't need to go anywhere else for cosmetics because they are all here!
5682,5.0,"This is the place for girls....all the make up stores are here.  For men, just look for a coffee shop and stay there for around 6 hours!!!"
5683,5.0,"You can basically get everything in one place ranging from street food, cosmetics, fashion, bags, shoes and entertainment"
5684,4.0,"If you are searching for skin care or makeup products, this is the place for you. Seems like every other shop is Korean skin care. Girls stand out and try to invite you in their stores as you pass by. There are also lots of clothing shops. We had Cold Soy Soup , not sure the Korean name for it, but it was good. Fun place to explore at least once."
5685,4.0,"Nice shopping! Alot of international brands also. Good place to buy all the cosmetics brand souvenirs. There's also street side stores later of the day. Our lunch at a certain basement traditional Korean food wasn't nice. But tea time at a random cafe at 2nd level was a nice experience. Didn't take a photo of the name of the cafe, only remember there's a tree at the center of the 2nd floor. We went in coz we saw the nice balcony from the streets! Not only is the place nicely decorated, the coffee n desserts were nice too. And they gave us a complimentary cake with biscuits! Totally make our day! A short walk to the base of the Seoul Tower from Myeongdong."
5686,5.0,"Shopping is an undertatement! MEGA Shopping is the right word for this great complex!!! You name it a store, they got it!!! Don't forget to bring your credit cards!!!"
5687,5.0,"1. Easily accessible by subway. Just get off at the MyeongDong station. 2. If you don't speak English or Korean, shops, especially skin care and restaurants, have employees who speak Mandarin. 3. I had a sausage in a stick all wrapped in french fries for only 2000 Won (street vendor). Very inexpensive and fulfilling. Couldn't finish it! Yum. 4. The same brand has different stores in Myeongdong. I shopped at one store and they allowed me to leave my purchase with them while I shop at other stores. Be sure you get a business card from them (with the store number) to retrieve your purchase. 5. They give you samples when you make a purchase. The bigger the purchase, the more samples you'll get. 6. Before you go, you can check online to see if they're having any promotions for foreign tourists. You'll get, for example, 10% off your purchase if you're a foreign tourist. Make sure you go to the correct store. The coupon would state the name of the store and the store number. 7. If you get too tired from shopping or purchase too much, you can find taxis next to the subway station exits."
5688,4.0,"Clothes....clothes....clothes everywhere! A haven for fashionistas...branded...korean made...name it! I prefer the small shops than the popular ones which are also available in my country. One thing I've learned...buy the item you like on the stop as its such a hassle going back after ""thinking"" about it and ending up going back to get the item."
5689,5.0,"I'd say walk here to 'see' what's 'IN' then buy at Doota & Migliore/ Erwha Women's University cos prices are slightly higher here. Note: Migliore here closed on Monday. Lots of great restaurants, just walk around and see where there 'ARE' patrons, you won't go wrong. Food: Great for Korean/ Korean barbecue/ Korean seafood, a few good ones here."
5690,5.0,"I have been to Seoul twice and insist on staying in Myeongdong for its central location, ease of access and great atmosphere. This holds for shopping too and Myeongdong is a shopping heaven. Whilst it has huge high-end shopping malls like Lotte and Young Lotte, it is really characterised by the hundreds and hundreds of street shops that flank narrow streets spanning a huge area. These shops are western and many brands are recognisable in the US and Europe. Goods are quality products at Korean prices (i.e. Significantly cheaper than the west but nowhere near Thailand prices). Only issue is you struggle to find large sizes as most are skewed towards smaller Korean sizes, especially for women.  In between the shopping you have restaurant upon restaurant, serving mostly Korean food but plenty of Italian food too. An infinate number of coffee shops and bakeries too. There are also Korean bangs (entertainment rooms) - tea bangs (my favourite), game bangs, dvd bangs to a few massage parlours (the massage parlours were way expensivo and not particular good). There are also two cinemas - one in Lotte and another in the street that have a late show starting at midnight. There is also the Myeongdong theatre definately worth checking out. I estimate that 90 percent of the people visiting Myeongdong are youngsters and this creates an exciting atmosphere. The place is absolutely jam packed every night of the week and weekend and every lunchtime during the working week.  For its enormous range in shopping, brilliant entertainment options and a buzzing atmosphere unlike any other I have experienced, Myeongdong is a fantastic shopping option worth international recognition in my opinion. Buckle up and enjoy the ride!"
5691,3.0,"For tourists short on time but in need of korean cosmetics or skin care shopping, Myeongdong is the place to be. Upon exiting subway station, look for young people in bright orange vest. They offer help and map in several languages and will point out your current location. Almost all the stores are on the street level so the walk is very relaxing.  Opening the map, you'll see that Myeongdong consists of several streets with duplicated stores. Pick a street with your favorite stores and shop there. When you're done, find one of the restaurants and have a great meal. Like most part of Seoul, if you go during peak hour, restaurants tend to be full. What's great is you can find out which restaurants are popular among local salary people (my Korean friends call office workers salary people). But going after peak offers a more relaxing meal.  I visited Myeongdong at noon. During the middle of the day, there was no stalls on the street. So if you like street shopping, go at night.  I don't think Myeongdong on its own is worth a trip. However, it's great to stop at Myeongdong, have a good meal and buy some cosmetics made famous by the popular korean drama and k-pop for oneselves or as gifts. The korean brand cosmetics are much better priced here in Korea than in the US. Some less than half what they cost in the US when they have their sales. Also buy Korean cosmetics in their own stores means no faked products from eBay. A great way to save, and play safe."
5692,5.0,"Good area for shopping, Korean cosmetic shops have dozens of shops in the area. Shopping for clothes here will also provide a good choice of local and foreign brands. A lot of small restaurants are spread along the side streets."
5693,3.0,"Perhaps I read too much before going, but Myeongdong is not as hyper as it is made out to be. While it is vibrant and good way to absorb the atmosphere for a first time visitor, the place wears down quickly as stalls after stalls repeat their wares - including knockoffs of branded goods. Most unique nonetheless are the beauty shops under Korean brand names which are nice. The eateries are distinctly Korean and that's the nice part. Lots of snacks, restaurants and cafes. The underground shopping arcade looks sad and unexciting - compared to Japan. In a way, it reminded me of China and definitely several grades below the shopping experience of Hong Kong. Worth a visit or two, but seen that....done that."
5694,4.0,"Good shopping, with a good mix of foreign and local brands of clothes. Lots of beauty shops too. There are also wide selection of food places.  The prices are varied, I got a 3,900won local Tshirt to a more expensive foreign label SuperDry.  Just one tip though : be very careful when buying the beauty products - look at the expiry dates, especially when the prices are much cheaper than other places."
5695,5.0,"Lots of clothing, cosmetics, restaurants, electronics, sports stores."

5697,4.0,"Street that always crowds by people..nothing much i bought from here but i had fun with their 'pasar malam' atmosphere with new thingy that i had ever see. The most attraction i was looking for here is Spao. It is a boutique that must to visit by kpop fans though. You can enjoy everysing on the 5th floor, and dont forget to take sticker pictures with your bias. They offered awesome stuffs at affordable price. You also can visit everysing at apgujeong branch but you may feel regret if not buy anything at myeongdong branch which is the main everysing shop. M plaza also located in myeongdong, which Kimchi Academy is located, where you can book kimchi experience and hanbok wearing package. Hanji mirror making also including in the package with 30,000 won for 2 hours class. Classes offered in Korean, Japanese or English. They open for new package with ddeobokki making experience for 2012.  Popular Hello Kitty cafe also located here, that one i had skip on my last journey. will visit next time. Myeongdong also one of the place to buy sourvenir but no much choices and quite expensive that you can find the same thing at cheaper price at other market."
5698,5.0,"This is the place to be for shopaholics, foodholics, and anyone who appreciates the modern culture! Food is everywhere! From the best street food such as Ddeokbokki, Fish sticks, and sugary snacks. Restaurants and Cafes are also available. Clothing stores, small ones to big ones like Forever21 and H&M, all line up the streets. and of course, Cosmetics companies are always swarmed for their products endorsed by your favorite actors and singers. At night, the shopping district turns into a night market, so beware of the crowd and watch your things!  Best time to come here is afternoon onwards till midnight"

Not just for shopping, also for people watching and I even get to meet the Korean actress Song Hye Gyo (from Full House fame) once there :-)) I stayed at a hotel just across Myeongdong, so I'll visit the place everyday :-P Many many many cosmetics retailers here, and the night market is also great. Haha, I just adore the place :-P It's a venue suitable for everyone, children, adults, mothers, aunties, just name it :-)"
5701,2.0,"There are plenty of foreigners here but if a Korean wants your dressing room or wants to order a meal first, prepare to give up your spot. Both of these things have happened to me a few times here. It is twice as the US and still slightly more than Europe unless you buy Korean off brands. The selection is excellent except for sizes; everything is very small and I often wear a small in US/Europe and shoes are often up to mens 8. Can often feel like an overcrowded night club but much more pushy."
5702,5.0,"Almost everything is here, from branded stuff to regular Korean fashion - good to spend at least half a day here!"
5703,3.0,"Lace up your comfortable shoes and take a shot of patience. This place is shopping on steroids. You can't possibly prepare yourself for how crazy this place is! It's all here, you just need to weave your way through the sea of people to find whatever it is that you're looking for."
5704,5.0,You will always find something interesting in some nook of myeongdong. And prices are competitive too
5705,4.0,"Myeongdong , really a good place to shop in Seoul. You'll find a lot of shops and restaurants around. The best time to shop is after 12pm. All shop are open for business. Most of the shop sales promoters able to speak English and Chinese , especially beauty products shop. There are a lot of hawkers if you go by evening. The famous Korea rice cake dip in hot and spicy sauce is good , it heated up your body during this winter. Cloths and shoes in this area is not cheap compare to HKG/SG/MY/TW but there is 1 thing which is worth for what we paid for , its Made in Korea. I bought 2 pairs of converse which is Made in Korea and 2 down jacket from Adidas which is also Made in Korea. Myeongdong is also 5mins away from Lotte Duty free. I did pay a visit to Lotte Duty free but came out with empty hand. Though is duty free but the price still consider expensive to me. You can actually pay in USD or KRW in Lotte Duty Free. By night , there are even more restaurant around in Myeongdong. I enjoy the Korean local food which also serve with famous kimchi."
5706,5.0,"This is a very vibrant area. Within a 5 min walk you have everything you would need to entertain you during your stay: Department stores, Shopping malls, boutique shopping, restaurants, bars, market retail stalls, and market food stalls. Book your hotel in or near this area!"

5708,4.0,"This area is a must place to visit if you're in Seoul. There are so many shops selling different items like clothes, shoes, bags, and cosmetics. Women would love this area. But the place is very busy. The sidewalks are full of people. I like this area better than garuso-gil or dongdaemun. Maybe because there are several shops that caters to men. Some shops are also familiar brand like north face, uniqlo, giordano, puma, etc"
5709,5.0,Cosmetics are cheap. Try the street food like the locals do. :) an awesome place!
5710,5.0,"I went there with three girls and we had the best-est time!! The energy of the place was intoxicating and we just kept laughing the whole time. The streets got lots of people so you have to keep moving, but you can always squeeze in some pictures in. We ate all some street food there of intestines, seafood pancakes. It was a fun experiencing eating with locals and curious tourists alike. At the day we went, there were celebrities endorsing the SPAO clothing shop so there were lots of screaming and crying people in front of the shop. My friends took home some paparazzi pictures also. As for the shopping, the clothes there werent the best but it was ok as I went there for the facial and body care products.Your friends can have fun time choosing from the wide array of affordable face masks, creams and scrubs. With each buy, you get tons of freebies, and theyre very generous with it (cotton, facial wipes, bottles of toner and moisturizer etc,,it can be a good enough souvenir to some of your friends back home) One thing I notice was though was most of the salespeople there go after Chinese tourists and can either speak Korean or Chinese, so it feels alienating if you know neither. But luckily, two of my friends were Chinese so we got very helpful and enthusiastic service from the stores."
5711,4.0,"This was my most favourite shopping street of all that I went to! Generally new and clean, unlike Namdaemun market street. Tons of restaurants, shops are great, value-for-money! A nice historic cathedral right next to the streets and the Seoul tower is just across! Spent a whole day there, a must if you go to Seoul!"
5712,4.0,"Recommend going on a weekday. Weekends are incredibly crowded it will be hard to make your way through the streets. Also go during late afternoon-night. This is when all the street vendors set up shop. Tons of designer knock offs and cute accessories for cheap and street food. This area doesn't close until around 11pm and even on weekdays, it will still be crowded but it'll be a little easier to breathe than on a weekend. Try the giant yogurt softserve, it's delicious!"
5713,5.0,"This is awesome for shopping, especially for tourists. It's great cause most of the outdoor walking area has no vehicles, only pedestrians. We went on a weekday afternoon, so it wasn't too crowded, but I imagine when evening comes, there will be tons of people! Lots of different types of shops and priced from high end to nice cheap bargains! Great for souvenir shopping too! It's also a better place to find more Western sized clothing as there lots of brand name shops. Tons of beauty and skin product shops, which was my favorite part!! Korean shops are also very generous so you get tons of sample of other beauty products when you shop in their stores. Girls would stand outside the shops to try to get you to go in, and often they would give you free stuff even if you just go in and browse (I got some free face masks). Lots of places to stop for a drink or a snack if you get tired. Overall, a MUST GO if you are in Seoul."

Apart from Migliore, clothes sold in the boutiques are expensive compared to Malaysian standard. However, you can find some good bargains for sale items.  What I liked about the streets here is that they are vehicles-free and there are rows and rows of stalls which lined up in front of the shops selling food, knick-knacks, accessories, bags, etc, etc.  There are many restaurants and food peddlars here. So you definitely will not go hungry. We even managed to get our hair cut here at less than USD 30. The salon is somewhere near Watsons and near is a nice shop selling spicy octopus and plain kimbap (sushi rolls) next to it.  Our loot apart from a nice hair do - lots of cosmetics (what else ?) shoes, accessories, food (seaweed rolls, etc), CDs, bags and clothes.  I find that the cosmetic shops here are more generous in terms of freebies and samples as compared to other areas. In fact, you don't even have to buy anything. Just head into one of the shops and the shop assistant will give you a sample or two. So, I bought most of my cosmetics here and the freebies are certainly handy for my short outstation trips.  What can I say. I love Myeongdong!"
5715,5.0,"I loved Myeong-dong. If you are looking for shopping, this is one of the best places in Korea to go.  Myeongdong has everything. The stores range from ridiculously high-end places with $700 heels and world-class designer wear, to the street stall markets and shops that you would see in places like Namdaemun and Itaewon. You'll also find everything in-between.  I personally love how there are so many boutiques that sell trendy clothing from local designers-you can find things that are one-of-a-kind, and great quality, too. These small stores are sandwiched between massive versions of stores that supply quality and affordable basics like Forever 21, Zara, and H&M.  Also, this is one of the few places in Korea where western sizes aren't problematic. I found jeans that are cut for curvier bodies, a rarity here.  The best part of Myeong-dong is that the streets are vibrant and crowded, K-pop is blaring along side the ""old pop"" that drawls from cheap radios in the stands and stalls, eye-popping fashion trends whizz by on 5 inch heels, and bizarre fusion foods are piled high on skewers and grills -you really get a feel for the crazy, ""bali-bali"" atmosphere of ""old meets new"" Korea as you shop!"
5716,5.0,"Myeongdong is a 'must visit' place with endless shopping and dining experience.There are plenty of fashionable stuff for you to buy,nice restaurant for you to try on and catch the people's 'live and latest' fashion trend.There are mascots walking around giving out brochures and you can take pictures with them. I will definitely want to be there again because this place is a 'paradise'!"
5717,4.0,"Myeongdong is quite possibly my favourite placed to shop in Seoul. So many beauty shops like Laneige, Skinfood, The Face Shop, Innisfree etc...great for us ladies of love cosmetics! Service in most of the shops seems to be very friendly and efficient, although much of the staff speak limited English. There are also lots of clothes stores like Forever 21, H&M etc...and places to buy food and snacks, not to mention a few street stalls selling purses, sunglasses, bags, shirts so you can bargain with them. It's generally very busy most of the time but the atmosphere is good."
5718,4.0,Much have been said about Myeongdong shopping so I won't talk about the same stuffs again. Just a tip to anyone going there soon. You are likely going to encounter numerous mascots in Myeongdong. Some of them stand in the middle of the road advertising for some restaurants. Notable ones would be a Garfield and a Snoopy. These are safe to stand beside and take a photo with them.  There are some mascots that stand outside the store that employed them. Stay away from them. They will grab you by the arm and drag you into their store.
5719,4.0,"Myeong-dong is a shoppers’ paradise although, as a previous reviewer has pointed out, it mainly seems to cater to young women. There are literally dozens of shops like “The Body Shop” and the local Korean equivalent “Nature Republic”, selling all manner of skin care, hair care and body care prods. There are also masses of street stalls hawking the usual array of cheap jewellery, clothing, souvenirs, trinkets and nik naks.  And for those (like me) not too fussed with shampoo and make-up, there are plenty of cafes, restaurants and bars to enjoy. American-style coffee bars like Krispy Kreme, Starbucks and Gloria Jeans abound and they seem to be thriving in Seoul, unlike in my home country, Australia, where many are struggling to survive.  With a few thousand won in your pocket (pretty cheap by Australian standards: one Aussie dollar buys about 1,100 won) you’ll never go hungry. A bowl of noodles with vegetables for example will set you back around 7,000 won or 6.50 Aussie. Many Korean eateries have English translations on their menus but in any event there are enough western-style restaurants if Asian is not to your taste.  Then there are the upmarket department stores. We visited the two largest and most famous ones, Lotte (pronounced Lo-tay) and Shinsegai. Both are within easy walking distance of Myeong-dong. But unless you are seriously wealthy, these are for sightseeing and gawking only and forget about buying anything here. However, you can eat at either as they both have food halls with plenty of choice and variety. We dined one eve at the Lotte Food Hall, which is just behind the food market in the basement.  We also visited the food court at Shinsegai – they call it the “Food Garden”. Unlike Lotte’s, Shinsegai’s food court is on the top floor. We lunched at the sushi counter which wasn’t overly expensive: about 7,000 won for three shared plates. Afterwards, we stepped outside to the children’s play area to enjoy the view. Of course, being the play area, the safety-conscious Koreans have built a high wall around it but you can still peer over the top for a view of the city.  But we found the best shopping is to be had in the underground concourses which lead you to the various train stations. They seem to have the best variety and prices. Better quality than what one would find aboveground and not nearly as expensive as the upscale department stores. Ideal to shop here for those little gifts for family and friends like fridge magnets, t shirts, pens and key rings!"
5720,5.0,"This place is surely a woman's heaven. There are so many brands of cosmetic products which sells at fraction of the price. My spouse went crazy shopping and was smilling from ear to ear.... Happy Shopping, ladies !!"
5721,1.0,This place is one humongous market and since I dislike markets in general I could endure 10-15 minute visit just for curiosity.
5722,4.0,"As a man I have to say there is not all that much there for us. There are stores and shops like Uniquo and Zara and many others that do sell men's clothing and stuff, but overall most of the people you see there will be women, about 70%. Men should not be turned off to go here, but keep in mind that mainly it cater's to women like most shopping places in the world. There are shops for cosmetic products, shoes, accessories, clothes, hats, etc. Anything you need as far as fashion you can probably find it here. There are lots of people especially when it starts getting dark, but even during the day it is fairly crowded. There are some stands that sell knock-off products also like belts and bags.  Also note, some of the outside vendors you can bargin with, but some you cannot. The belts are a great example of this, even when they are packing up to go home they will tell you one belt is 15,000 and last price, but guess what, no matter what time you go there, it's the same price. For some other stores it may be different, some of them will bargin at the last minute, but do not expect a huge discount, perhaps 500-1000won depending on how expensive the item is. If the item is really expensive, like 60,000won you may be able to get 5000. Do not push too much as some of them seemed to get a little annoyed at tourists doing this. But there is some bargining room at some of the stores.  Keep in mind that a lot of shops start packing up between 10 and 11pm. Honestly I cannot remember if it was 10 or 11. But the whole area pretty much shuts down around that time.  There are also places in the area to buy ginseng products, but no one there speaks English or very very limited English. So if you need advice or help you may be out of luck. But you can look through the products, they do have a huge selection and I think most people can figure out what it is if you are only looking for candy or something like that, it is easy to find.  I would have to say that Seoul itself is a paradise for women shoppers, where some department stores are open 24 hours a day and others do not open until like 8pm, there are a few of these in the Dongdaemun area for example.  There are also many resturants in the area, many of which the staff speaks no English, however some of them do have English menus.  Anyway I think it is worth a look for at least a few hours. And if you happen to want to see the Nanta show, one of the theaters is located in this area, in Seoul there are three, so make sure if you already have tickets that you know which theater you are supposed to go to.  Grab a map at the hotel also and look for the people wearing red shirts in the area because they can help you or maybe even give you a map of the area. I forgot where we got our map for this area only, but it was useful nevertheless."
5723,5.0,Since there is not a review in English i will tell you this place is nuts. Super fun shopping district with street vendors and food. If your are traveling with a female young or old this is the place of there dreams. If your single this is the place of your dreams. I liked it much more then Harajuku and thought the prices were much cheaper. Oh yea this is cosmetics central too. I thought this was the most fun area in Seoul and not to be missed. Late evening is the best time to go.
5724,4.0,"We were here on X-mas eve and it was jammed-pack that we could hardly move! At some point, I even thought that it was worst than Beijing subway during peak hour!! It's definitely a good place to shop and to eat. Found a nice sushi joint in the alley next to the Apple store. It was yummy and the price is reasonably cheap. It has post-it notes all over the wall and ceiling. Do try the street food vendors. Although one of our friends got stomach bug on the 2nd nite we were back there after eating the cinnamon cake from street food vendor. The others were all ok though..:-) You can find the same items that were sold by the street stalls in Dongdaemun with cheaper price."
5725,4.0,"Lots of shops and very busy, for the traveller from North America there is not a lot that can't be found at home at less cost. You should visit more for the spectacle and the food."
5726,5.0,"The 9/F of Lotte Department Store is a duty free shop with many Korean brands of cosmetics at a 5-15% discounts. The ginseng face cream from a famous Korean brand costs about 40% less than in Hong Kong. The varieties available are, however, not as many as their specialty shops in the streets of Myeongdong.  I also highly recommend a nail polisher at famous chain store starting with ""I"" which gives one a shinny nail after a few rub - really amazing and extremely cheap! We did not know what it was before the shop lady gave each of us a rub on our fingers on the spot! Great fun!"
5727,4.0,"Myeongdong is a nice place for shopping, lot's of shops, usually with clothes and place to eat! International brands are also present, but because of this the atmosphere is way tooooo far from ""Korean"". And many things you can find in the same shops but in other countries...  http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SH/SH_EN_7_2_3_1.jsp <-- Nonprofit site by Official site of Korean tourism - Myeong-dong"
5728,5.0,"I only had a few hours shopping at Myeongdong in July while on a business trip. The stores don’t open that early. I got there shortly before 10 in the morning and some of the shops are just setting up. There are a couple of cosmetics stores that are “must stop by” places if you are interested in Korean cosmetics. The Missha store in particular was worth stopping by. The same product is $30 online and I got it for around $12. If you are interested in fashion, then Myeongdong is definitely better than Namdaemun Market. The stores at Myeongdong have trendier stuff than Namdaemun Market, which is only a short walking distance away. Namdaemun Market is better for the older generation to buy clothes, also household items. If you can, plan your day so that you can have lunch at Myeongdong. I had Bibimbap (mixed rice with vegetables), yum….."
5729,5.0,"Of all the areas I went to in Seoul, Myeongdong was my absolute favorite. The streets were just lined with so many shops and good restaurants. It was a great place to get some good deals on clothes and accessories. I especially enjoyed the department stores and live performances. There was just so much to do."
