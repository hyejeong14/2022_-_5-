The view from there is great and there are also shops with drinks as well as souvenirs (they're quite reasonably priced actually). There's also a restaurant both at the base and on the tower. Overall, I think it is great for a chill day in Seoul.

Living in Seoul, I went to a farther place to play and see, but I was embarrassed because I had never been to the nearby Namsan Mountain. It was especially nice to be able to show my sons, who tend to sleep early, to see the night view of Seoul. My sons liked it so much that I was even proud to think that it was even better. Due to time constraints, we couldn't go inside the tower, but the exterior was beautifully decorated, so we took a lot of pictures. Come visit us!  (Original) 아들들과의 버킷리스트 중 하나를 이룬 날이었습니다. 서울에 살면서 더 먼 곳으로는 놀러도 다니고 구경도 다녔는데 정작 가까운 남산을 한번도 안가봐서 머쓱하더군요. 특히나 일찍 자는 편인 아들들에게 서울의 야경을 구경 시켜 줄 수 있어서 좋았습니다. 아들들도 너무 좋아해서 더욱 잘왔단 생각에 뿌듯 하기까지 했습니다. 시간 관계 상 타워 안으로는 못 들어갔지만 외관도 이쁘게 잘 해 놓아서 사진 많이 찍었습니다. 한번 다녀오세요!",19 hours ago

76,Meredith Guarino,5,"We walked here from our hotel in Myeongdong. The prices were pretty normal and we enjoyed the sights a lot! You can walk a path to the tower or take the gondola for a small fee. Then the tower itself has a fee to the top. At the top platform after the cable car you have a cafe, souvenirs shop, pagoda, and a nice view. Once in the tower, it gives an amazing 360 degree view of Seoul. There’s a cute candy store at the top for kids and a souvenirs shop with postcards and magnets, shirts, etc. They have various packages too where you can get two tickets into the tower+2 beers or sodas+ a love lock for $36,000 krw. You will need to make a reservation for this. We went around 4:30 and it was busy but not too bad. On our way down there we’re tons of people heading up for sunset- which is a very busy and crowded time so try and avoid that if you don’t want crowds.",5 days ago

I was pretty sweaty and winded by the time I made it to the tower.  The view from the lower observation areas is spectacular, honestly even better than the view from the tower itself. This is primarily because people smudge the windows inside the tower, and there are so many kids buying souvenirs and candy up there.  That said, going up is kind of fun and they make it into a bit of an experience, with an interesting interactive video projection/art room and some cool videos in the elevator. There’s also a really nice restaurant inside the tower if you’re interested in impressing a date.  Definitely worthwhile. I’d recommend hiking up!

And the accommodations, technology, and overall vibe of not just the tower but the surrounding area was absolutely stunning.  You'll get an amazing view over Seoul and it's surrounding mountains / nature. I visited S. Korea during 2018 - 2019 (pre-covid / pandemic) and looking back at this experience, it was really memorable. Nostalgic even. And personally, disregarding the tower's height, this experience was FAR superior than other towers like the CN Tower in Toronto.

342,Metaler메탈러,5,"(Translated by Google) * N Seoul Tower (aka Namsan Seoul Tower) has been established as a landmark and tourist attraction in Seoul for a long time.  [How to get to the tower] 1. Get off at Dongguk University Station Exit 6, take bus 01 and get off at Namsan Seoul Tower 2. Take the Namsan Cable Car to the top. (There is a parking lot at the cable car stop) 3. Climb Namsan on foot to get to the tower.  The trademark locks of N Seoul Tower are constantly increasing and there are a lot of them. I wonder if there are thousands of them... This is the first tower I visited in 10 years, and it seems to have changed considerably in the meantime. There was also a spot where you could see a distant view through the glass wall, and the lighting was refined. There is also a huge room on the way up to the observation deck of the tower, and the children love it because the lights are flashy. There is a cafe even when you go up to the observatory, so it is recommended to go up to the observatory in the afternoon to enjoy the sunset and have a cup of coffee. As it is an observatory where you can see most of Seoul, it seems like a place that is second to none in the world for viewing the night view.  However, in the case of the toilet in the observatory, it can be very disconcerting as it is made of glass that allows you to see the outside, whether it is a urinal or a toilet. Personally, I think there are few toilets in the world with a view like this, so I recommend using it at least once.  There are many restaurants around the tower, making it an ideal location for sightseeing.  (Original) *오랜세월 서울의 랜드마크이자 관광명소로 자리잡은 N서울타워 (aka 남산서울타워)  [타워까지 가는 방법] 1. 동대입구역 6번출구에서 내려 01번 버스를 타고 남산서울타워 정류장에서 내리기 2. 남산케이블카 를 타고 정상으로 이동하기. (케이블카 정류장에 주차장이 있음) 3. 도보로 남산을 등산하여 타워로 이동하기.  N서울타워의 트레이드마크인 자물쇠들은 계속 늘어나고 있으며 엄청나게 많다. 몇만개는 있지 않을까 싶을 정도... 10년만에 방문한 타워인데, 그 사이 상당히 세련되게 바뀐듯 합니다. 유리벽으로 먼곳을 조망할 수 있는 스팟도 생겼고, 조명들이 세련되어 졌습니다. 타워 전망대에 올라가는 길목에도 거대한 방이 있는데, 조명을 화려하게 쏴주니 아이들이 참 좋아합니다. 전망대에 올라가도 카페가 있어 오후에 전망대에 올라가서 석양을 감상하며 커피한잔 하는것도 추천합니다. 서울 대부분이 보이는 전망대이기에 야경 감상으로는 세계 어디에도 뒤지지 않는 장소 같습니다.  다만, 전망대 내의 화장실의 경우 소변기든 대변기든 바깥이 전부 보이는 유리로 되어있어 굉장히 당황스러울 수 있습니다. 개인적으로는 이렇게 뷰가 좋은 화장실은 세계에도 몇군데 없을것이라 생각하기에, 한번씩은 이용해보시기를 권장합니다.  타워 주변에는 식당도 많기에 관광지로는 최적의 입지를 갖추고 있습니다.",a month ago

531,Ilse van Ewijk,2,"Having been to many cities worldwide, I have been up my fair share of observation towers. And sadly, this has got to be the worst one. It's as if whoever designed the observation deck, did not do any research into what makes a good one. I went at sunset time in hopes of enjoying the city lights. Annoyingly, the observation deck area is filled with souvenir shops, coffee shops and even a candy shop. All of these produce a lot of light that reflects on the windows inside, making it hard to see outside and even more difficult to take pictures. To add onto that, the windows are incredibly dirty and are covered in fingerprints. The outside was also caked in a decent layer of dust. There is no outside platform, so this is all you get. The one goal of an observation deck is to be able to observe, and this goal cannot be accomplished properly. It was honestly a huge disappointment, and I would not recommend the hassle of taking a cable car and then wasting even more time trying to go up the tower just for this.",a month ago
