So please do not rely on magic passes. It worked before pandemic, today did not work at all. We queued for 3 hours to join  the first attraction (yeeeah!) No need to say that this drained our energy  quite a lot. Later we queued for an hour and later on for another 45 min. 2 hours for Atlantis (not fun at all if sun is shining and it looks more like a perfect day for beach. So, my recommendation to you all: avoid summer break period, do not rely on getting a magic pass, and save some money to get the ticket which allows you to ride 5 times any one without queuing (costs 49000 won) p/person. On the positive side, employees are always kind and helpful, it could get difficult with English speaking. Food is a little bit expensive but ok. So, overall is a good attraction.",a week ago

363,B J,4,"This is a 3.5 to 4 star experience. This is actually one of the few indoor things you can do in Seoul all day during the brutal summer weather. The place is massive there's a lot of things to do. Many many rides and activities. There's a very large cultural museum that will take a few hours just by itself. I give it lower stars because the more serious rides are mediocre at best and has longer lines than anywhere I have ever been to before. About 2.5 hours of wait time for example for the most popular ride. Here's a tip for foreigners. Websites likes viator and trazy offer substantial discount for foreigners (as of July 2022) if they show their passports at the entrance. It's about 35% discount on average. You do have to book a day ahead for it though not the day of. But if you are getting this discount then consider buying their Magic Pass which will make you skip lines at most of the rides except the super popular ones I believe. I wasn't able to get the discount cause of time constraints but if I had to redo, and had time, I'd get the discount with the magic pass, which night have made the overall experience far more pleasant.",3 weeks ago

Just go to the front of the line to the magic pass area and hand your ticket over and they will circle one of the numbers and let you in. The lines were 90-120 minutes for the more popular rides on a Friday in late July 2022. So the extra fee for magic passes was definitely worth it.

412,rilla Go,5,"(Translated by Google) Located at 240 Olympic-ro, Songpa-gu, Seoul, a complex shopping mall with a building area of 581,645 m2 and a site area of 128,246 m2. In a broader sense, it includes not only the complex, but also Lotte World Tower, where the Lotte Group headquarters is located, Lotte World Mall, Lotte World Aquarium, and Lotte Water Park. On July 12, 1989, Lotte World Adventure, an indoor theme park, officially opened, and on March 24, 1990, Lake Park Magic Island was fully opened. The total investment cost is 650 billion won, and it is operated by the world division of Hotel Lotte, a subsidiary of Lotte Group. It is connected to Jamsil Station on Seoul Subway Lines 2 and 8 by an underground passage, and can be accessed above ground through exits 3 and 4 as well. From the largest shopping mall in Korea to movie theaters and theme parks, it is a place where nothing is missing except for the natural scenery. Adventure, the world's largest indoor theme park after Ferrari World, and Lotte Tower, the world's fifth tallest skyscraper, form two carriages, demonstrating the majesty of Korea, the 10th largest economy in the OECD GDP and an advanced country.  As the Lotte World Mall was built, it was said that the future of Lotte Department Store Jamsil and Lotte Mart Jamsil, located in the Lotte World area across from it, was unclear, but things are going well. After all, both of them are in the top sales ranks in department stores and marts, respectively, so even if they rot, it's okay.  With Lotte monopolizing the Jamsil area, Lotteria seems to be gaining momentum in the fast food sector. In the surrounding area, other fast food brands other than Lotteria are almost completely wiped out, and McDonald's and Burger King cannot be found. You have to walk to Seokchon Station or near Songpa-gu Office to find one or two Burger King. On the other hand, Lotteria has more than three or four including underground shopping malls. When the weather is nice, it is good to take a walk in the nearby Seokchon Lake. It is fun to see the cherry blossom trees in spring and to see Magic Island from the lake outside.  (Original) 서울특별시 송파구 올림픽로 240에 위치한 건물 면적 581,645㎡, 대지 면적 128,246㎡ 규모의 복합쇼핑몰. 더 넓은 의미로는 해당 단지 뿐만이 아니라 롯데그룹 본사가 입주해있는 롯데월드타워와 롯데월드몰, 롯데월드 아쿠아리움, 롯데워터파크도 포함된다. 1989년 7월 12일에 실내 테마파크 롯데월드 어드벤처가 정식으로 개장하고, 1990년 3월 24일 호수공원 매직아일랜드가 개장하면서 완전한 모습을 갖추었다. 총 투자 비용은 6,500억원이며, 운영은 롯데그룹의 계열사인 호텔롯데의 월드사업부에서 하고 있다. 서울 지하철 2호선 및 8호선 잠실역과 지하통로로 연결되어 있으며, 3번 출구 및 4번 출구를 통해서도 지상으로 접근이 가능하다. 대한민국에서 최대규모의 쇼핑몰부터 시작해서 영화관, 테마파크까지 자연경관만을 제외한다면 없는게 없는 곳이다. 페라리 월드 다음으로 세계 최대 규모의 실내 테마파크인 어드벤처와 세계에서 다섯번 째로 가장 높은 마천루 빌딩인 롯데타워가 쌍두마차를 이루면서 OECD GDP순위 10위의 경제대국이자 선진국인 한국의 위엄을 보여준다.  롯데월드몰이 들어서며 건너편 롯데월드 구역에 위치한 롯데백화점 잠실점과 롯데마트 잠실점 등의 미래가 불투명하다는 말이 나오기도 했지만, 잘만 되고 있다. 어차피 둘 다 각각 백화점, 마트 업계에서 매출액 상위권에 들어가는 곳이라 썩어도 준치다.  잠실 일대를 롯데가 독점하고 있는 특성상 패스트푸드 쪽으로는 롯데리아가 확실한 기세를 잡고 있는 듯하다. 인근 주변지역에 롯데리아 이외에 타 브랜드 패스트푸드는 거의 전멸상태로 맥도널드, 버거킹 등은 찾아 볼 수 없다. 석촌역이나 송파구청 근처까지 걸어가야 간신히 버거킹을 한두군데 찾아볼 수 있는 정도. 반면 롯데리아는 지하상가 포함 서너군데 이상이 있다. 날씨 좋은 날은 인근 석촌호수 산책도 괜찮다. 봄에 벚꽃 나무 구경에 외부 호숫가에서 매직아일랜드를 구경하는 재미도 쏠쏠하다.",a month ago

I don't know if it's because of the covid but the organization is hopeless... long queues outside the real queues (and no one in in front of the rides, so an entire empty space while there is a crowd just after...). We can't take the covid excuse, the mask is on and we're so glued to others in the second line that it's ridiculous! Many attractions closed or checked during the day. A sick world when there is still school, people working, no holidays or vacations... so I don't know why but it was Christmas today! So with the new system for waiting (and the Koreans who prefer to take a picture of themselves than to move forward...) well, we wait 2h10 instead of 40min before doing an attraction! We had to make up our minds to make children's games to avoid losing our money and wasting too much time waiting... (we still waited 2 hours for an attraction outside and 1 hour 45 minutes for another inside) In short, I do not recommend during the pandemic, it was so much more pleasant before!

On ne peut pas prendre l'excuse du covid , le masque est mis et on est tellement collés aux autres dans la seconde file que c'est ridicule ! Beaucoup d'attractions fermées ou en vérification dans la journée. Un monde de malade alors qu'il y a encore école, que les gens travaillent, pas de jour férié ni de vacances... donc je ne sais pas pourquoi mais c'était Noël aujourd'hui ! Donc avec le nouveau système pour attendre (et les coréens qui préfèrent se prendre en photo que d'avancer...) bah on attend 2h10 au lieu de 40min avant de faire une attraction ! On a dû se résoudre à faire des jeux pour enfants pour éviter de perdre notre argent et de trop perdre notre temps à attendre ...

I think you should take pictures during the day or go before the parade and line up to take pictures. At 9 o'clock, the lights go out immediately, so it's not very pretty.  (Original) 롯데월드 너무 재밌어요! 놀이기구도 다양하고 매직패스가 인당 3개가 있어 30분마다 성공하면 바로 탈 수 있는것도 좋았습니다! 퍼레이드도 재밌었고 마지막 성 배경으로 사진 못 찍은것이 아쉬워요. 낮에 사진 찍거나 퍼레이드 전 미리 가서 줄서서 찍어야할거 같습니다. 9시 땡 하면 불이 바로 꺼져서 별로 안 이뻐요.",a month ago

506,Laura van Nassauw,1,"(Translated by Google) Unfortunately we didn't like our trip to Lotte World. Many attractions were not open and the waiting times were excessively long. For example, we had to queue for 2 hours for an attraction, this was not even for a roller coaster or something. We were able to do 3 attractions in the whole day we were there (and we were already there in the morning). So this is not worth the money! They are already pricey tickets anyway, so you expect good value for money. That's why we started complaining if we could get our money back. I must say this was not a problem for them and we have had it back. Thank you for that. But would I recommend Lotte World to anyone? Not right away. It will be a nice park, but the waiting times at Disneyland are even shorter. Maybe we were just there on a busy day and on non-busy days it's not too bad. But that is not certain. Anyway, we won't be coming back. It's not worth spending your day on!  (Original) Helaas vonden wij ons uitstapje naar Lotte World maar niks. Veel attracties waren niet open en de wachttijden waren overdreven lang. Zo hebben we  bijvoorbeeld 2 uur moeten aanschuiven voor een attractie, dit was dan nog niet eens voor een achtbaan ofzo. We hebben in die hele dag dat we er waren geweest 3 attracties kunnen doen (en we waren er 's morgens al). Dit is dus niet het geld waard! Het zijn zowiezo al prijzige kaartjes, dus je verwacht wel waar voor je geld. Daarom zijn wij gaan klagen of we ons geld terug konden krijgen. Dit moet ik zeggen was voor hun geen probleem en we hebben het ook terug gehad. Waarvoor dank. Maar zou ik Lotte World aan iemand aanraden? Dat niet meteen. Opzich zal het een leuk park zijn, maar de wachttijden in Disneyland zijn zelfs korter. Mischien waren we er net op een drukke dag en valt het op niet drukke dagen wel mee. Maar dat is dus niet zeker. Wij gaan in ieder geval niet terug komen. Het is het niet waard om je dag aan te spenderen!",a month ago

The timeslots are strictly limited per ride and day. The long waiting times mean that you can only do three rides a day, each lasting about 2 minutes.

829,lilysieun,4,"(Translated by Google) On weekdays, I went in after 4 for after4 with my child, so I rode it 7 times, 9 times the number of times. ^^ World Monorail, Flume Ride, Jungle Exploration Boat No. 2, Sinbad Adventure, Dream Boat No. 2, Wild Valley, and Wild Jungle! And after seeing the last night parade and seeing Magic Castle Lights Up, I left ^^ First of all, after 4, 1 adult and 1 child, I went for 43,000 won at a discount because it was a Samsung Card event period. It was very good~ There are many places to eat, so there is no time to be hungry. There are many fun things to do indoors with children and outdoors for adults. The downside is... First of all, it's almost impossible to make a reservation for a Magic Pass through the app. Still, they sell premium magic passes as mentioned above.. 5 tickets or 10 tickets... Really... annoying situation... And the waiting time for Lotte World is really long... It's very cumbersome to go out and go to the bathroom and go back in again after asking for your understanding because there is no restroom in the middle after entering at the entrance. It's especially hard to stand in the children's bathroom ㅠㅠ I struggled.. Even on a weekday, I waited 70 minutes to ride the Flume Ride, but it's still so thrilling! hehe It's in the middle of Seoul, so living in Seoul has the advantage of being close and good, and the world has gotten better, so I think the 4D rides were really realistic and fun ^^  (Original) 평일에 아이와함께 after4 로 4시이후 입장해서 그래도 7가지, 횟수로는 9번 탔어요. ^^ 월드모노레일,후룸라이드,정글탐험보트2번,신밧드의모험,드림보트2번,와일드밸리,와일드정글까지! 그리고 마지막 나이트퍼레이드 보고 매직캐슬라이츠업까지 보고 퇴장했어요^^ 우선 after4로 성인1,아이1 했고 삼성카드 행사기간이라 할인받아 43000원에 갔어요. 아주 좋았어요~먹을데가 많아서 배고플틈 없고 아이랑은 실내,어른들은 실외가 재밌는게 많아요. 단점은...일단 앱통해서 매직패스권 예약하는게 인기있는건 거의 안된다고 보시면 됩니다. 그래놓고 상술로 프리미엄매직패스권을 팔아요.. 5회권이나 10회권... 참...짜증나는 상황.. 그리고 롯데월드 대기가 참 긴데...입구에서 들어갔다가 중간에 화장실이 없어서 다시 양해를 구하고 밖으로 나와서 화장실가고 다시 들어가는게 굉장히 번거롭습니다. 특히 아이들 화장실 참기 힘들잖아요ㅠㅠ 고생했어요.. 평일인데도 후룸라이드는 70분을 기다려서 탔네요 그래도 그만큼 스릴만점! ㅎㅎ 서울한복판에 있어서 서울살면서 가기는 참 가깝고 좋다는 장점이 있고 세상이 좋아져서 4D놀이기구가 진짜 실감나고 재밌었던 것 같아요^^",2 months ago
