117,4.0, I got married at COEX but every time I visit I get confused 
118,2.0, The space arrangement is inefficient and it is difficult to guide the way inside You think it has to be complicated so that people stay and shop in that maze

188,5.0,"Closure of boutiques & cafes in Dongdaemun n Myeongdong, esp Lotte Fitin n Roem, forced me to look beyond these teo familiar places for alternative tourist shopping n cafe-hopping. Thanks to guidance of Myeongdong Tourist Ambassadors, Dongdaemun Tourist Centre n helpful n English-speaking Koreans we met along the way, I still managed to have plenty of shopping at Coex Mlall, Fashion Square Wangshinmin & Goto Mall-cum-new Fashion Square. Sistina, Covet Blan of Coex Mall r my favourites. You must try fried rice w seaweed topping, Gimpbab n Bulgogi set at Coex Mall, and Nolbu Budae Jjae at Goto Mall after tired but enjoyable shopping."
189,5.0,"Quite a nice place, amazing architecture and some good window shopping place.  The mall just outside the train station so eady access and no worries of miss the way."
190,5.0,This is a cool mall. You have to go to the library part in the middle. Amazing. Never seen anything like it! The mall has a cool atmosphere too. Located in Gangnam. Nice as evening approaches with the skyscrapers surrounding the mall lighting up.
191,4.0,"I always bring my friends here once they visit Korea. You can expect various stores like every common malls out there, don't forget to visit the library, best for photoshoot."
192,4.0,"This library is famous among tourists who come to South Korea, located inside COEX Mall in Gangnam district, you can find lots of book genre in many languages, they alo provide book store if you want to get the books or magazines you like.  The vibe is actually kind of not suitable to read some book there because it's usually quite packed with tourists taking pics and stuff, but they do providing some corner and reading tables if you still want to read your book on the spot."
193,3.0,"Such a big mall. We went here because of that ""instagramable book store""... Apart from the book store, just the usual mall with lots of dining and shopping options. Near Gangnam District, though we didn't go there anymore."
194,5.0,"One of the best meeting points in Seoul. Lovely awesome bookstore with local shops, cafes and restaurants."
195,3.0,"会議での利用（大ホール）。 COEXモール内には、ショップ、水族館、図書館があります。 図書館は、本を提供する体制というより、内装や雰囲気重視で外国人的には見ごたえあります。  I visited for meeting (large hall). There are shops, aquariums and libraries in the COEX Mall. Libraries are more attractive to foreigners because of their emphasis on interior and atmosphere rather than the system of providing books."
196,5.0,There is a beautiful and instagrammable library inside the mall. They also provide prayers room for Muslim tourists so no need to worry if you want to do some shopping here.
197,5.0,It was one of the coldest but most memorable new year's eve countdown parties I ever experienced! The food stalls were up as early as noon and people started coming in early. There were plenty of security personnel around so it felt safe and was not hard to move around. The mall was open until 10pm. We had formal dinner before the countdown party. The program began at around 9pm and it was fun as expected with many Korean TV personalities in attendance. The fireworks did not disappoint too!! It was a night to remember!
198,2.0,"I agree with most that the architectural display out side the Starfield COEX Mall is impressive to say the least. But inside? That's another story. Low ceilings, very dole and depressive. We felt as encased for a lack of better words.  It does not represent inside the modernistic approach from the outside. The quality of the stores are really average and we believed that a structure of this kind would have design better stores and with better choices. Most things once again, cheap Chinese stuff, disposable value items and again the infantile South Koreans with stores filled with teddy bears (for adult people) cute cartoon printed made in China socks (for adults) and the distribution of the stores....very confusing.  Not a well planned mall and nothing to offer except for the Starfield Library, which is really pretty and impressive. Two floors library with lots of colors and places to eat. Basically the only highlight of the Starfield COEX Mall which is pretty average.  Except for the Starfield Library which you can access directly from the streets, the rest of the mall is a waste of pure time. Not recommended."
199,4.0,"Chance upon the stacks of books at an underground mall. It was beautiful. Apparently, you can get a book to read or just simply sit around the area. Nice place to visit."
200,3.0,It’s you’re average mall. The library area was kind of cool.. until you realize that many of the “books” are fake and attached to the shelves. Was even more of a bummer when I saw that the “fake” books had duplicates all over the shelves.. They couldn’t even get unique fake books. 🤦🏻‍♂️  Here’s a picture of me looking at a real book about behavioral economics written in Korean. That part was cool.
201,4.0,"There are many shops, restaurants and so on. It's good to visit during lunchtime if you work nearby. Starfield Library is a free public library. Nice place to chill. Locating in a business area, I think it's not specifically designed to attract foreign tourists. But, we have seen many of them. I guess they prefer this for shopping, photos, aquarium and Bongeunsa Temple."
202,4.0,The highlight is off course the multi story public library .  But there are also variety of stores and restaurants.
203,3.0,"I was expecting this mall to be bigger for shopping but it's not that big. I didn't visit the aquarium but I did to to the library which was unique and impressive. The shops weren't anything I haven't seen before in Seoul either. The food trucks at the front had long queues, maybe it would've been worth the wait since we entered up having mediocre expensive vietnamese food inside the mall."
204,4.0,"This is the largest underground shopping mall in Asia and it does not disappoint. Of all the shopping malls that I’ve been to in Seoul, this one most resembles those in the States. If shopping weren’t enough, there is a cinema and conference area. One of the most unique parts of this mall is the library that sits in the middle. It’s a lending library with shelves from floor to ceiling which continue to the floor above. Just as incredible is the fact that it’s packed with people sitting around and reading. Yes, there are people in Korea who go to the mall to read. Incredible. Another live-and-learn moment."
205,5.0,"My fiance and I were checked in at Intercontinental Grand Parnas and this mall was very convenient for us. From dining to shopping and even visiting the COEX Aquarium. I love being here although prices in stores are quite expensive.  Tourists like me would find this overwhelming and it will indeed give you some thinking as to buy a lot or not. Haha! I just bought a couple of souvenirs to take home. It would be better to buy from elsewhere, though.  If you happen to be in Seoul, this place is worth visiting - and to explore."
206,3.0,"Very wide. Complex structure. But attractive place. There are many restaurants, too. I really liked the library. I think You don't have to visit. But it's not bad"
207,5.0,Plan to spend the entire day (at least) if you want to see the whole place. Lots of variety in stores and restaurants. A bit overwhelming and a challenge to navigate due to it's sheer size.
208,4.0,"COEX is a big shopping mall and convention center. Famed for being in the Gangnam district made famous by the you-know-what song. COEX isn't the only place to visit and you can visit several attractions like the art hall, SM Town, fountain plaza, duty-free mall, casino, aquarium, bongeunsa (temple) & megabox."
209,4.0,"Starfield at COEX is one of the best malls in Seoul, quite large, lots of choice of shops and restaurants. It is one of two co-joined malls, also with two hotels, movie theater and much more. One can easily spend half a day there. So large that it is at times easy to get lost but lots of signage helps. Whenever we are in Seoul we go to this mall to stroll around and see whats new and interesting as well as to have a nice meal. Really one of the best in the city."
210,4.0,"The huge, pile of books but arrange neatly on the second floor which can be seen from the ground floor makes the mall stunning, and instagrammable foto opts!"
211,5.0,"Must the the most tourists-visited library in the world. A must-see, surely. Not large but the design is unique and visitor friendly. Rest of mall is quite standard with usual shops. There is an aquarium too."
212,4.0,"We visited Starfield Coex Mall on a Sunday noon in September 2019 . Upon stepping into the mall, we were so so impressed by the huge library which is located right in the centre of the mall. There is a mammoth collection of local and foreign books and magazines and the tall huge walls are lined with books as well. The library is very spacious with many seats available for reading and browsing pleasure. Besides the amazing library, Starfield Coex is a modern mall with everything shoppers need for fashionwears & accessories and services for all ages and also plenty of dinning choices. Understand that within this hige mall, there convention halls, cinema and aquarium. We didnt explore much as we were heading for other destinations given our short stay in Seoul. It is a beautiful Mall and l would love to return for another visit for this is a place to make me smile , especially the lovely iconic library ."
213,4.0,"Lots of shops, restaurants and art to see. Easy to get to from train and genuinely just a good time with friends and family."
214,5.0,"It is not just a Mall and a big shopping center with a huge food court but it also features an architecturally interesting library. With Free entrance, people could just walk in and read books which were just line up on the shelves. There were chairs and tables around the place. Many people were coming not to read books but to take photos of the place as it is very popular for tourists."
215,5.0,"if you are a kpop fans especially SM stan this place is a must list to visit because SM COEX ATRIUM will give u an experience to get close to your idol, inside SM there's museum, photobooth, merch shop, cafe or even auditorium. and Coex Mall is really nice to look around also the most iconic there's a library inside mall with amazing decoration and huge scale of bookshelf . U can also take a pic in here."
216,4.0,"The mall is great. Modern, lots of good shops and restaurants. Well connected to the metro and bus stop. The library in the center of the mall is a great place for pictures. There is an aquarium attraction which is great. It is also connected to the Hyudai Department Store, Intercontinental Hotel and SM Town Museum. As a family traveler, we appreciate the baby room which had all the facilities we needed. They had changing tables, resting area, nursing rooms, baby cots, and baby feeding area. Very thoughtful."
217,5.0,"Starfield Library is something very special! Thousand of volumes, magazines from all over the world, even magazines for interior designers, gardens, e.tc, from France and Italy, are all in the disposal of the citizens without any discriminations. It is worth it to pay a visit. You can buy or borrow (inside) the library, everything you might have in your mind. In general, the huge store Coex is available for your entertainment as for your shopping."
218,4.0,Love this mall as it has nice shops with international and Korean brand. Very crowded on weekend and the beautiful library is also the main attraction. The Hyundai hall is a good place to start to hunt for food. You can easily spend your day here.
219,5.0,The mall is very huge. The good thing is. I came when Korea Great Sale was happend. and i was really amazed by the giant library!!!!
220,4.0,"We stayed at the Intercontinental COEX which is connected to the COEX mall. Very convenient. The mall is huge and you can find all the usual shops such as H&M, Zara, Uniqlo,....lots of food choices as well. Great food hall where you can get great deals after 7 pm. Definitely a nice way to spend a few hours."
221,4.0,This is more upmarket mall next to SM town and Starfield library. It has lots of different shops - great place to hide away from The summer heat. It also has restaurants serving different food with a cinema
222,5.0,"The best place to meet colleagues in Seoul is COEX Mall, everything is here. We ate in a great restaurant, beauty products were all on sale here, kids had a wonderful time playing, and the big plus is the huge library with books everywhere. I wonder if they had English books there.  I was here a few years back (2015) but the changes took me by surprise. You could spend all day in this place. Coffee shops, restaurants of all types were here. Shopping for souvenirs and clothes were all in one place. If I had time, I would have liked to visit the aquarium and SM town but I was on a tight schedule.  Thank you my former students for meeting me here and seeing the gigantic library full of books. It was a great stop for me while I was in vacation in this country."
223,3.0,"Coex mall is pretty much Korea's version of the mall in the states. Not just western designer such as Zara and H&M, but the layout is not your typical Korean style mall. Building is long instead of tall. I do recommend to come here at least once for the amazing library design. Stores are ok but the library has amazing layout with gorgeous backdrop. Also a good place to come if it rains."
224,4.0,"COEX Mall seems to be the largest mall in S Korea. It has got everything from what I see ..... from clothing and accessories stores carrying domestic/international/designer brands .... I like shopping in Aland. Lots of restaurants and cafes inside this mall so whenever you're hungry, there's something to eat for everyone. It has a large cineplex with a total of 17 screens, the COEX Aquarium, the ASEM Plaza and the Event Court. The Starfield Library inside the Starfield Coex Mall is impressive with thousands of books and hundreds of seats. The library is located right in the middle of the mall, but it’s not your average quiet library as it's bustling with students and people having a fun day in the library."
225,5.0,Took the KTX train Seoul to Busan. The train ride was fast but only on few occasions did we touch the 298 km/h mark. But it was nice and thrilling enough
226,4.0,"Excellent place for many quality stores for clothing, traditional Korean goods, dining, occasional small concerts, art shows, etc. Starfield public library in the center of the mall is a must place to visit."
227,4.0,"This shopping mall is huge with a lot of shops, department store, aquarium, duty free, casino, subway station, library, etc. The best is you can check in here for your flight. Stay near this mall if you need a convenience place for shopping."
228,4.0,"While the daughters were touring the SM COEXartium to get their fill of SM kpop, we enjoyed wandering through this upscale mall. Both Korean and International stores were located in this large, modern mall. Food options were plentiful and many looked trendy and inviting. A huge library was located in the center.  For more Kpop things, we went outside the mall to see the massive Gangnam Horse Hand sculpture inspired by Psy's Gangnam Style song which was viewed over 1 billion times on youtube."
229,4.0,"Really good underground mall with numerous shops and eating joints. The shops are mainly of democratic brands like Armani Exchange, Zara, etc. Lotte Duty Free is also there as well as an interesting bookshop and Kakao Friends store. The complex also encompasses an aquarium, a movie theater and a library."
230,4.0,"It is huge and it is very very easy to get lost. So honestly check out the library and then some local stores, because otherwise it is a large mall with a pretty good food court."
231,5.0,"Not all libraries are quiet spaces. In this area there are huge walls of books right in the center of the mall. It makes for a perfect picture opportunity but also an opportunity to read books, socialize, or relax. Attached to the mall are many shops and restaurants and at the opposite end there is the aquarium."
232,4.0,"The world's largest underground mall contains numerous retailers, as well as the huge Starfield Library. However, if you want to come out into the light of day, be sure to cross the street to explore the Bongeun-sa Buddist temple and enjoy the unique Hyundai Development Company headquarters, Tangent."
233,4.0,"Then this is the place to go. Loads of nice shops, plenty of places to eat and drink plus all kinds of attractions including a library and an aquarium!"
234,5.0,"Lots more to do than a typical mall, including a movie theatre, aquarium, library, and every type of food you can imagine."
235,5.0,"I normally frequent several of my favorite stores there.This mall has all of the stores I wanted all in one place. Daiso, Pierro Shopping (competitors to Daiso), Butter store for specific items I want to buy which we don't have in the U.S."
236,3.0,"The library was huge and very nice! But almost all the books are in Korean so unless you know Korean or bring your own book, it’s simply a place to sit, relax, and people watch. There are also cafes and an E-Mart inside the library."
237,5.0,"I walk here at least one Saturday each month, to shop at No Brands and The Hyundai stores, eat at one of the many restaurants, pay my mobile bills at the SK.Premium store, watch a movie at Megabox, have a smoothie from Joe & the Juice and walk around for a while looking for sales in the myriad of other shops in this large modern underground mall. Definitely worth a visit and it's easy to reach by bus or subway."
238,4.0,"COEX mall is an upmarket underground shopping mall. Having been to several shopping malls before in Asia and Europe, the place did not excite us. We did not spend a lot of time here. The main reason we come across this place is because of the Gangnam style sculpture which is located at the eastern patio of this mall. It is a bronze sculpture of two fists/hands overlapping each other just like the fists motion of the gangnam style dance.  We took a lot of pictures with the sculpture on the background."
239,3.0,"We came here to visit the library. A good mix of restaurants, fast food, food court, local and international brands. Love the Copenhagen flying tiger and Butter which offers creative and innovative home decor products."
240,5.0,Seoul is famous for its markets but you can have a more relaxed shopping experience in Coex. I'm not much into fashion but I can stay for HOURS in the home section in ALand. It's got a huge collection of items from Flying Tiger Copenhagen which I love because they're fun and funky and oh so cheap. The food court offers a wide range of choices too!
241,4.0,"If you are into mall tours, this is the perfect place for you. It also has a library and the Gangnam style statue outside the mall... Nearest subway Samseong station."
242,4.0,We were staying near by and visited the mall frequently for shopping and dining. Great mall. Super clean. Lots to do and see.
243,4.0,"Went to this mall because I wanted to take photos at the library. There are lots of shops here - pharmacies that sell beauty products, my favourite store Aland, Innisfree, bookstore, cafes, aquarium etc."
244,3.0,The underground mall is a great place to go during the winter months. There are plenty of stores to browse. My favorite park is the public library inside!
245,3.0,"Given this mall is spread so wide, it will take much walking to cover the grounds. You will find all your known brands inside. They even have an aquarium but will need entrance fees @ 28k won to enter. Lots of restaurants and cafes as well."
246,5.0,So if your in Seoul and in the Gangnam gu area this is a mall you should visit. These are my reasons: 1. The mall has very different and unique shops available 2. Neva seen a Library inside a mall and it's so huge and the you won't be disturbed by the sound of the shoppers outside. There is soft music heard in the background. 3. Had a LOTTE duty free inside (things are steap but if Ur brand conscious - not a bad decision to visit then) 4. Fabulous Aquarium inside the mall. This Aquarium is HUGE. Even better than the Ripley's aquarium at Toronto  The food options is also good enough for all kinda traveller's.
247,4.0,If you are in Seoul definitely come by COEX and spend a day or afternoon. There are great restaurants with a variety of international cuisines which is great if you need a break from Korean food. It is a nice place to shop and browse for gifts as well. Make sure to check out the library which opened a couple of months ago. It makes for great photos!
248,5.0,"It is really the largest underground mall in Asia!! Despite being so large, signage are well placed & very clean mall."
249,5.0,This place carries a cheap dollar store as well as foreign and Korean brands. It has an area to get souvenirs. Picked up some great Korean shoes and clothes. I feel the prices are very comparable to the States but way better quality. The library is great to see.
250,5.0,"The prettiest library I’ve ever seen! This library located in the middle of the COEX mall. The library is lovely and in a quiet environment, very modern design!"
251,4.0,"The mall can be reached via 2 subway stations, Samseong and Bongeunsa. Can walk straight via underground into the mall. With many retail shops, F&B and SM Town (a 6 floors k-pop museum), one can spend hours in here. Special mention to the brilliant library which is a must visit. It’s an open concept."
252,5.0,"We have limited time visiting Korea but we made sure to visit Coex. We visited Coex near closing time so we went straight to the library. I love the library, it is a good place just to rest and read. I can spend my entire day here. I will surely go back here."
253,5.0,A great place to eat and shop. We stayed at a hotel connected to the COEX which made it very convenient/an adventure when we looked for different restaurants for our meals. They have a really interesting library in the middle of the COEX.
254,4.0,Big underground shopping mall with lots of things to do. A lot of restaurants to choose from. There’s also a food court which we tried out. The highlight was the library. A must see!
255,4.0,"Coex is very huge mall with lots of shops, restaurants and entertainment places like cinema, aquarium etc. However the best thing about this mall is the amazing libaray in the middle of the mall. If you tired after lots of walking at the mall, you can relax at the library even though most if the books in Korean. Shops are ordinary, nothing is unique and most of them is Korean product."
256,4.0,"There's quite a lot to see here, full of shops and restaurants and even the beautiful Starfield Library. It's in a great area, close to many cafes and restaurants and even close to Bongeunsa Temple so to me, this is a must see mall and area."
257,4.0,"If you have seen the movie Beauty and the Beast, you know the scene where the Beast takes the blindfolded Belle into his library and then, upon removing her blindfold, she looks up and all around and sees this library that stretches as far as the eye can see in all directions. THIS is the same library! I am sure of it! Perhaps it was the inspiration for this portion of the movie. Come to COEX Mall just to see the library and you will understand what everyone is talking about! I loved seeing entire families sitting there together with books. I was amazed to see children off all ages, sitting in nooks against the window panes, reading. How wonderful of Korea to have inspired so many children to enjoy the simplicity of curling up with a good book. A real, actual book, not a tablet or a computer. A paper book to hold in their hands. I hope more countries will be inspired as well."
258,4.0,A place with everything what you want! And the most spectacular ‘Starfield Library’ 📚 is the highlight herer.
259,4.0,"One of the best shopping malls I really enjoyed it here , everything in one place and the ResturAnt's are good"
260,3.0,"It is a pricier shopping mall with mostly high-end stores. The library is interesting, which holds live bands, frequently."
261,4.0,We love going to COEX Mall and seeing it's ever-evolving range of clothing and food stores. The library is an amazing photo opportunity for the savy tourist. We found ourselves constantly walking in circles and getting confused direction simply because of the size of this place. It is a great mall to visit!
262,5.0,"Great Place to shopping. many products with many promo and disc also.  also the library, it's really cool"
263,5.0,"Housing the largest underground mall in Asia, this place served as a great respite from the blistering 2018 summer heat. You will find plenty to do here - there is even a library! There are also plenty of familiar names for shopping. Having come here with the family, my wallet was very much lighter when we left!!"
264,5.0,Huge and packed mall! There´s something for everyone. Also great for buying fun souvenirs or toys. Many coffe shops and restaurants. You can easily kill many many hours in here. Dont forget to visit the peaceful bongeunsa temple right next to the mall.
265,4.0,"Great things about this Mall  1. The library: beautiful 2. great collection of stores 3. has a aquarium, great for kids 4. easy to get to by subway(via line 2 green line)  However, you need to watch out for LUNCH TIME. All the restaurants are packed with hungry lunch goers, you literally have to wait in line for everything. You can't even find a seat at the cafeteria. It's just that busy. So my advice is eat early or eat late, just don't expect to walk into a restaurant around 12:30 and get a table right away."
266,4.0,Specifically visited here just to see the Library within this shopping mall!! It was wonderful to be surrounded by so many books and so many people reading!! The glass roof is a great addition for those studying below. I'd love to know how they reach the ones at the top!!
267,4.0,"The stores are really expensive, but you can find cheap stuff if you're determined. The food court is breathtaking, the variety is huge. There's even a supermarket part of the mall, with kind and helpful employees. The library speaks for itself."
268,5.0,"The mall is underground, and very wide. The building that you saw, a part is SM TOWN, and others maybe offices or places for exhibition. Because when we went there, there was baby- something -exhibition. Inside the mall there are cinema to watch movies. But, since we thought the subtittle would be in korean/hangul, we decided not to watch movie there. But the place is so nice and big. there is arcade games; cafe; also marvel shop and it's quite complete. There is big aquarium too. But we decided not to go inside. We got there already night. shame. But most of all, I really like to go to SM TOWN. Hahahahaha... eventhough I only sight seeing, but it was so amusing. Must go there for tourists who are fans of KPOP!"
269,4.0,It’s a huge underground mall with many stores selling so many things and some restaurants. Worth seeing if you’re in Seoul. We did not go to the aquarium or cinema so cannot comment on those. A typhoon was expected the day we went so it was wet which may have accounted for the crowds.
270,4.0,"The awesome library allows you to take dozens of fantastic photos and make sure you are able to stand out among instagram,"
271,3.0,"Worth a visit just to see the library. If you are staying in one of the nearby hotels, it's a good place to walk around in the evening."
272,4.0,"Specially traveled here to visit the library. Not very huge, but definitely worth taking some nice pictures. Also dropped by the SM museum and aquarium since I was already there. Had a quick lunch at the basement CJ foodcourt. Limited options and food was alright."
273,4.0,With the locals even on a weekday. Not sure if it’s the season but most of the Brand are on sale. There’s a good mixed of local and foreign Brand. Good place if you’re looking for fashion and cosmetics.
274,5.0,Awesome place to visit.Many shops and nice food. Always has something going on. Great atmosphere to walk around or relax.
275,3.0,"This shopping mall is easy to get to via subway, and offers a comfortable shopping experience with international clothing brands and a few trendy korean brands. If you are looking for a lower price range of clothes or unique korean designer clothes, this mall is not recommended.  But be sure to check out the starfield library which is a very famous photogenic spot!"
276,4.0,We were looking for the coex aquarium and found out that this is where it is. I dont see any sale except this is where the cheapest fon covers can be bought and i regretted not buying. And also the receptionist can speak english well so when you’re lost try asking. This also close to SM Town. And their book shop/library is the highlight it was too huge and it’s good take some photos!
277,4.0,"You can find everything you need here; foods, stuffs you'd like to buy or cinema. Also museum of K pop stars. ;-)"
278,4.0,"This is stunning mall, the big dashing design libraries and equipped with high brand clothes and food, there also kimchi museum, my planned to korea 2nd time is not to explore mall but my “new” friend tag me along to her ittn so i was amazed with this huge mall."
279,4.0,"Dropped by the Lotte DFS COEX for a quick Prada shopping. was able to get a 10% discount using the Lotte VIP gold card. you can apply for it at the entrance as long as you have a VISA signature card. As Prada is not a local bramd, you can only collect it at Indheon Airport on the day of your departure. For local Korean brands like their skincare and cosmetics., you can collect your items on the spot"
280,5.0,"Visit this shopping mall that has different shopping experience as also several well known Korean and international fashion brands and home style shops .There are several restaurants and cafes in the mall not to forget a magnificent public library in the heart of the mall.It also houses banks . The mall opens 10.30 a.m. and closes at 10 p.m. Customers can visit by Line 2 at alight at Samseong Station Exit 5 & 6 and Bongeunsa Station Line 9 , Exit 7"
281,3.0,"This mall has an amazing core library and that’s all, it has the same shops than any other mall, and for instance uniqlo has fewer clothes or Kakao friends shop is smaller than others. So if you are going to stay a couple of days in Seoul it doesn’t worth a visit"
282,5.0,"it's a must visit shopping mall, we can find something different from any others, when shopping mall and a library as one. very instagramable, take picture right at the library or the mega popcorn at the mega box cinema, I bet you won't regret it."
283,4.0,"A great place to get out of the cold in the winter. It can challenging to get here from the city center in a taxi (especially when it is snowed and rush hour), so the metro may be best way to get there. Lots of food options and shopping. The library was very cool."
284,5.0,"This mall is the most interesting place, if you are planning to visit Korea in freezing day or scorcher. Simply said, this place provide everything in a just an area, shopping, sightseeing, theatre, eating, hotel, and even aquarium. it's really huge so please beware of using information centre or electronic map in the mall. Additionally, the mall is connected with Sam-sung station (in line 2), so the first-visitor will not be struggled with finding a mall."
285,5.0,"It’s a nice big mall with lots of shopping, food courts and a n aquarium too. Many international & local brands can be seen,. Outside the mall there are many food stands with long queues"
286,4.0,"Large mall with lots of food types. Connected to samseong coex station & can be easily covered. Lots of shopping, spacious & Asian, Thai, Korean foods are available."
287,3.0,"Covering the underground of a huge block (under COEX, hotels, office buildings), there is a large number of mainstream shops, several food/restaurant courts, a two-storey library - except for the restaurants and the shoppers you don’t get a specific Korea feeling here. Prices appear also to be slightly higher than in traditional shopping areas."
288,3.0,"We only visited here for the Brick Live Lego shop. During our short visit, it seems the mall has events at their exhibition halls.  In addition to restaurants, there were McD and other fast food joints. Mall is connected to the Seoul metro."
289,3.0,"Family and I came to this mall for shopping on the recent vacation. A member of the family got stomach issues from bad food for several days. Finally could not wait any longer so we stopped by a doctor office for medical attention. All we paid was about $20 for doctor visit(in the state it could cost hundreds without insurance), the clinic look very professional, inside the doctor office there are medical instruments(high tech and low tech) all around. After consultation, doctor prescribed medicine that we got at a pharmacy next door, very convenient."
290,4.0,"huge mall with plenty of things to do (cinema, aquarium, library, shopping, cafe, restaurant).  shopping wise is not the go to place. But intersting library design worth the visit."
291,3.0,The library was amazing! But to be honest I was pretty disappointed by the shopping. We went out of our way to go here after reading so many reviews but didn't find anything special or exceptional shopping wise. Anything you can find here you can find and Lotte Department Store or any other shopping area. Worth a visit if you are close by.
292,5.0,"Starfield COEX is a vibrant underground mall which offers visitors an amazing diversity of experiences. There is a beautiful library which radiates an aura of serenity in the busy mall. Authentic cusine from Turkey, India, Thailand and range of Korean food and fusion food. The mall is linked to the exhibition halls which can be accessed easily on account of the excellent signage. Prices are reasonable and the mall offers very good value for money. A must see, must experience mall. Five stars from me for ambience and feel good factor. Amazing Korea."
293,5.0,"Coex is a huge mall in Gang nam, seems like it has everything including the coolest library. Can you imagine a library in a mall? Worth a visit to take photos!"
294,4.0,"The library is very impressive with nice design and many books. We took a lot of photos there. There are many people reading the books and having a cup of coffee. There are many shops, restaurants there also. It is nice to visit this place."
295,3.0,We went there to see the huge library. It was on the ground floor in the COEX mall. It was “MUST SEE” spot. There were many people who actually use books. I wished if I could have read Hangul.
296,3.0,Found an under 10$ store here and bought a lot of items. It's an underground mall. Very large and easy to get lost. Has a fantastic library here and an aquarium
297,1.0,This mall in gangnam area and it far from my Hotel Lotte city.In my opinion this mall is waste of time nothing especial and you can not compare it with lotte department store.It too expensive.This place is good for meeting not shopping.In fact this place was huge mall before change it.I will not come back
298,4.0,"This mall is nearby to gangnam gu area. Its a huge underground shopping complex which is a part of much bigger coex convention centre. The famous coex aquarium is situated within this mall. This mall has many entrance gates. It remains open till 10 pm (some of the shops start closing at 9:30 pm) after that only the restaurants remain open till 11. Many of the good restaurant s too close by 9:30 pm. So its better to visit this mall early in the evening. This mall houses many local as well as international brands. It is also a good place to buy some souvenirs though it will be a little costly. There are varieties of restaurants serving different cuisines of the world. One can get Korean, Japanese, European, Italian, American, Indian & Mediterranean restaurants there."
299,5.0,"there are some great places to eat in here. one of the neatest book stores i have ever seen. we stayed near the mall, worth the visit if it is nearby."
300,5.0,"After visiting SM Town, we visited the COEX mall next door and decided to grab lunch at one of the many restaurants located inside. The mall is massive: there are lots of stores and restaurants that we didn't have time to check out. What I liked about this mall was the underground passage that connected to the mall. We were there during Christmas and it was snowing, but due to the underground walkways we were able to cross to the other side without any difficulties from the weather."
301,4.0,"best place to shop in one location - much better than meong-deong or dongdemun. Has some most major stores, an aquarium and a massive library/attrium. Foods, shops, cinema. Massive area."
302,2.0,"Yes, it is large, but the walking areas are very broad and the stores are big too, so there weren't as many shops as I expected. Overall I found it to be sterile and uninteresting. I had a much better shopping and people-watching experience at the Lotte World Tower and Mall place."
303,3.0,"So, this is a mall, and it has lots of large retailers. There's an aquarium (separate listing) and a cinema, and it is across the street from a temple, and has its own metro stop, but it's not really worth a visit if you are coming from somewhere that has average large retail stores."
304,5.0,"A different interior from the usual mall. I like that wherever you came from, there is an entrance/exit nearer for you. And finding a library in the center of the mall, with awesome placing of so many books, is so great."
305,4.0,"We went to the COEX mall mainly for the aquarium however the shopping and food outlets provided extra attraction. The mall is easy to get to and is very modern. The food court offers a good variety of Asian cuisine but many individual restaurants are available of different culture. The library here in the centre of the mall is the biggest ever. Such a large variety of shopping, you are sure to find most things here."
306,5.0,"The beauty of this mall is the Information-- very good command of the English language. Helpful for travelers who are looking for things, or are lost.  It offers the usual things a mall offers: good affordable restaurants, clothings stores, bookstores (with English books), etc. It's also connected/located to CoEx, to Oakwood Premier, to Hyundai Department Store, to Parnas, the CoEx Aquarium.  Not sure until what time the place is open (or if it closes) but we did a quick run to McDonald's late at night and passed through here from Oakwood and back."
307,3.0,The mall is okay. Can be confusing. Was very tired afterwards. Couldn't do the aquarium as it didn't take our card and we didn't have enough Won on hand. Overall stores were experience compared to American stores but we new that going there. Restaurants were very diverse. Not the greatest mall I've been to.
308,4.0,"C1 ( 2017.04.13 ) I visited this shopping mall because I want to buy some books. There had many facilities like restaurant, shop, book store and theater, etc. Many brand shop and food court was operating, too. All was good with good atmosphere, but there was confused because of complicated load. Need detailed road sign, I think."
309,3.0,"Coex is a great place to get your 10,000 steps in for the day. Shopping is uninspiring. No anchor stores. There is no organization to the placement of the stores. I would go there only if I've exhausted all the shopping options in Seoul."
310,2.0,Ok I wouldn't call it the hidden gem of Seoul . The shops are expensive and I wouldn't have even visited the place if it weren't for a meeting near by. The duty free Lotte mall attached to it demands not only your passport but the return e tickets before letting you buy anything.. so if you want something from there keep the required documents with you.
311,4.0,"I am not huge fan of malls, but I had to go check out the COEX Mall. It is really big and you can easily spend a whole day there. There are several options for restaurants - western food too. Between the COEX Mall and the Samseong station is a big hands monument in honor to Gangnam Style song by Psy. It plays the music and you can see the video clip in a screen. Since you are in Gangnam why not take a picture there? You can either get off Samseong station from the green line (2) exit 6 or Bongeunsa station from brown line (9)."
312,2.0,"A large mall between the 2 intercontinental hotels, and linked to the CALT airport bus station  Middle tier and quite boring. Some global brands like Zara, little known ones like dyptique, and many local brands  Quite difficult to find good food also"
313,4.0,Located at gangnam district. Very big mall has an aquarium on the bottom floor and many shops if u like shopping it's heaven.
314,4.0,"My first time to Seoul was in 2003 and one of the so called tourist spots was COEX. Haven't been back to Coex for almost 15 years since my last visit (even I have been to Seoul many times after 2003). Good to see that Coex has changed to a better outlook, it seems so new to me."
315,4.0,"Everything on one level all underground, it will keep you from turning in an icicle when the weather outside is unbearable. Big Åland store here if that's your thang."
316,4.0,"We went to Coex 2 evenings in October 2016. One night we we to check it out and for dinner options. There are so many restaurants. It was a 7 minute ride from seongsu station here. The mall is 2 levels, but there is a mini level by the aquarium hidden in a corner with eateries there too. Very bright and clean looking throughout. Many clothing stores. There is a large good court too. Also, a movie theatre and aquarium. Aquarium was very good on the other night. It closes at 8 pm with ticketing ending at 7. We got lost trying to find our way back from the aquarium one night, but discovered the food court which had lots of seating and some nice options. Here we ate bulgogi and noodle soup with galbi short ribs."
317,5.0,"I am not a fun of shopping but the size of the mall is overwhelming. Located in center of gangham style, it provides a lot of things to do. Has an aquarium on the bottom floor and many famous brands to shop from. It is pretty pricey but it is expected considering its location (gangnam). Would recommend to see it, even if just for a quick stroll throughout the mall (still might take an hour)."
318,3.0,"It is a large shopping mall. Suggest you check out the flow of the traffic and understand reach one end to the other. There is an acquarium, cinema, amusement park, supermarket and lots of coffee chains.  Definitely a nice place to spent a cold winter or extremely hot summer.  Take time to browse through some of the stuff which is Korean unique.  Avoid the office crowd from 12-2 pm."
319,3.0,"Sure there's a lot to do, and there are plenty of places to shop. There are festivals and clothing stores and restaurants and an aquarium and movies and and and. It just goes on and on. It's hard to find your way around with the curving non 89 degree angle turns. THere are info booths with English to help you find stuff.  It's just a bit daunting. Give yourself plenty of time to walk, to get lost, and then to find the subway / bus / exit you need at the end."
320,4.0,"This mall is so big even our taxi driver got confused trying to drop us off! The layout is daunting at first, but just keep walking and you'll be pleasantly surprised at the flow of the massive space. We found a healthy variety of common western brands and unique local ones, from luxury goods to discount stores that sell cell phone accessories. Similarly the food options are numerous. A whole day is barely enough to enjoy all the shops and amenities of this shopping complex. It's conveniently accessible via subway too!"
321,5.0,"It's busy, expensive, and has everything you might ever want at a considerably higher price than you'd likely find in pretty much any other country in Asia, but if you have that European or American ""itch you can't scratch"" this is the place for you. They also have lots of great restaurants and don't forget to visit the Aquarium and KPop Museum (if that doesn't make your ears bleed)."
322,5.0,This mall has it all:  - Affordable brands on clothing. - Duty-Free on cosmetics. - Lots of choices for food. - Entertainment for all ages. - Subway stations just below. - Several hotels.
323,5.0,"This mall probably has everything you need from home goods to little cute things that you can find in Korea. They are currently in process of constructions and more stores to come in. It's a great place to hang out, shop and eat."
324,5.0,"A giant mall in the Gangnam district with something for everyone. Ranging from local products to high end products, a cinema and an aquarium. Coffee shops everywhere and a huge variety of places to eat. Information desks spread everywhere with helpful staff that speak many languages."
325,3.0,one big long mall! lots of redundancy of vendors. huge. fun. easy to navigate. connects two hotels. nice oasis.
326,3.0,"visited here since it's one of the biggest malls in korea. wasn't really too impressed by the shopping. but if you're an SM fan, there's an SM Coex Artium area which has a shop (usually packed with fans) and all sorts of other things to do. Also there's a city airport on level 1 that has a money changer that provides pretty decent rates."
327,5.0,"This is a gigantic mall. You can find all the big name Korean brands as well as American and European brands as well. Super fun to go with the family, so many the escalators, the kids should enjoy it. Plenty of food and resting areas as well."
328,5.0,excellent venue for conference. really enjoy it and would like to come again in the future for any upcoming events there excellent place !!
329,4.0,"It's the biggest underground shopping mall in Asia in the coex building. One of greatest aquariums connected to the coax mall, exhibition, convention center, intercontinental hotel, casino & movie theater etc. Line2, exit8 of seolleung station."
330,5.0,We took Gangnam station line 2 to reach coex mall. It takes around 7 minutes. The mall is too big and quite. Many restaurants are there and you can find Halal too. Many famous brand you will find with Korean brand.
331,5.0,"It's a really huge mall. It's so easy to get lost inside it. But everything you need is here. From Korean and international clothes and cosmetics to food and services. This mall is in the same building as the exhibition halls so it's really convenient if you have an event to attend since you can just walk around while waiting. It's also connected to the City Airport so after checking in your baggage and going through immigration, you can go around the mall while waiting for the bus that takes you to either Incheon or Gimpo airport."
332,4.0,It is a very big mall you can't finish it at one visit. Very unique shops there. مجمع كبير جدا لا يمكن إنهائه في يوم واحد. يوجد به العديد من المحلات الفريدة.
333,4.0,"One of the interesting places to visit in Seoul is the COEX Mall.I would say don't miss it. The best way to get there from the city center, if you are taking the subway, is to take line 3(the orange line). Line 2(green line) will also take there, but line 3 takes less than 25 minutes.Take line 3 to Seoul university station and then take line 2 to Samseong station. Whenever you get out of the train look at the station and vicinity map posted on the platform to see the closest exit to the mall. As you enter the mall, make a right and you will see the information desk and a virtual interactive map of the layout of the mall.Check this out before you start exploring the place. Check the various restaurants and the food court before you decide to eat. Believe me, you wouldn't want to miss out on some of the best food in Seoul, all under one roof. Also check out the various retail shops, just browse, even if you don't buy anything, this would be an interesting experience. Once you are done with the mall, check out the area around the mall. There is always something going on.When I visited in September, there was a free K-pop concert ( Korea Sale Festa) going on near the mall."
334,4.0,"One doesn't see how big Coex Mall is from street level. A large part of the mall is underground and it is huge. Thus, wear comfortable shoes. Since this is Korea, the mall does have a lot of skin care, make-up and beauty stores. Many of the shops in Myeongdong are also in Coex. There are who stores and fashion stores and a lot of restaurants. There are high end shops but also bargain places like Daiso. What I wish they had though was bookstores and shops for stationery, pens and art materials. For a tourist who has to attend a convention in the nearby Coex convention centre, this is a good place to shop. Also a good place to get gifts to bring home."
335,4.0,"The Mall has all Kinds of Brands that is usually found in the Market, the Mall is very Spacious and Probably the Biggest in the City, it has an Adjoining Art Center and Other Places for Shopping. it can be easily reached through Taxi, Trains and Buses."
336,4.0,I was attending a conference in COEX convention center. So this is the mall as well. So big that you may get lost. Little costly but there are lots of items. Many food outlets to choose from in case you are hungry. Food is not so costly.
337,4.0,"This is a huge underground mall which has a stature of gangnam style hands outside which is a tourist op. Inside has a money change bank , lots of food places, subway access. and of course commercial shops. Good to spend half a day if the weather outside is too extreme. But it is very commercial. Doesn't represent the true culture or Korean style in my opinion. So a couple of hours is the most you should spend here. It is across the street from the temple so it's handy to cool off or refresh after the temple visit."
338,4.0,"This mall is very much like every other mall. There is a very good variety of shops and it has all the major skincare brands and make up brands. The clothes shops are also very trendy and cool.  The food malls have a large variety to choose from, the is halal food for Muslims, which is very convenient and new. Last time I visited almost 2 years ago, the wasn't any halal places to eat. Now there is, which I am very happy about!  The staff are very helpful and friendly. The location is very easy to find, right next to Samseong station.  The mall is located in a very nice area, very up and coming!"
339,3.0,"This mall is nice if you're bored, have lots of money and if it's raining out. This mall used to be for the middle class but now it's just ridiculous. The majority of the new stores are so expensive, only rich people can afford to shop here."
340,3.0,"This is a big serpentine mall, lots of stores, nothing really special, bring crumbs to find your ay out!"
341,5.0,"The mall is large and quite new. Also includes a casino and Aquarium. When we were there, not all stores were complete yet as it was still fairly new. It also didn't seem too crowded."
342,5.0,"This is the luxury place , Shopping department store, And also aquarium located there , you can also reach casino near by. Great to see , but closing soon at night !"
343,4.0,"A great place for a rainy day! It's easy to get lost in here because it really is big! Loads of shops (particularly cosmetic shops), cafes and restaurants! In general the shops here are more expensive. I could spend several hours here browsing and shopping without getting bored as there's loads to see!"
344,3.0,"We came here in hope to visit kimchee museum on a rainy day. Unlike Myeongdong, this mall is full of local people! It is pleasant and a lot less crowded. However, we were a little disappointed that kimchee museum is closed."
345,5.0,So close to aloft hotel easy to get there as most cab know it. Nice shopping place and lots of food there and everything in one stop
346,4.0,"This is a nice big Mall with lots of products and restaurants.Is nice especially on a hot day to cool down, If you love footwear i recommend you to visit ABC Markt is a great store with great selection and the price is really good."
347,4.0,"Like other extra huge malls, COEX mall has everything you need under one roof. The unique point is, it's connected to city airport check-in mall, 5 star hotels, Hyundai Department Store, world trade centre and conveniently link to Samseong metro station. Local cafe and eating places at cheaper price mostly hidden at the corner; more premium cafe and restaurant is at easy to spot location."
348,3.0,If you are a SM Town fans you will find this place so great you can find your bias merchandise and they have a coffee shop and theater. there are a mall next to it have some shops and its next to the metro station
349,1.0,"If you are looking for a mall where lots of things happen don't go to this place. They have every brand and every big shop which involves clothes, shoes and accessoires. Just 1 marvel shop and some minor kid stores. Other areas got way more variety in stores."
350,5.0,"Underground shopping center with variety of choices when it comes to shopping for clothes and more, alot of restaurants and a cinema is available. Connected to 2 department stores (Hyundai & Parnas) 2 mins walk to the subway line 2."
351,3.0,"I arrived a little after 10 on Sunday and felt like it was a ghost town. The mall is enormous but there were just a few people about. The stores seemed to be closed or without any customers. When I came later, around noon, it was hard to get around as the mall got very crowded. And it was apparent why. Queues were forming in front of all restaurants which aren't in a dedicated food court but scattered all around. Apart from many restaurants and a few stores, the mall is home to several halls where 3 different conventions were being held on the day. In addition, on the second floor you can find hundreds of small businesses."
352,3.0,"Meh!  If you are looking to shop, sure go shopping...but if you're looking for some uniqueness, then look elsewhere.  Within 5 mins I was bored. However, there was a large bookstore with a English section, so nice to sit and have a read (until an obnoxious English man with his child decided to read really loud - (no consideration). Would be a great place to relax and read a book (com' on tourist, have some class :) #grumpy!  Enjoy (if you want to go shopping and want to buy and read a book)!"
353,5.0,A huge mall with most international brands available. Ideal for those looking to buy branded stuffs. There is a lotte duty free store in the mall.
354,3.0,"When we visited this mall I kept wondering: maybe it's just because I am an American. We walked and walked and walked and we never found really much of anything. It was very strange. And then we would find ourselves in a giant, empty convention-hall lobby? All malls in Korea are not like this: we found several other malls to be sensibly laid-out and easy to navigate. Not so at the COEX Mall."
355,4.0,"If I were organizing a world conference with 30,000 participants, this would be a very attractive venue. Sandwiched between 2 5 star hotels, the conference centre and mall are testimony to South Korea's economic success. The most fascinating part is the Hyundai Department store basement, where you can get an overview of a wide variety of Korean food."
356,4.0,"We had a great day there and helped us get past the jet lag. Famished we went straight to get some mouthwatering neng myun or cold noodles and grabbed a bingsoo dessert. Lots of food options and was surprised to see even Indian and Turkish food.  But what we liked were that there's a nice aquarium for the kids which we'll have to come back for since we spent most of the time at the kids lounge (Pororo). Traded off shopping while the kids played.  Also visit the Kakao store for adorable character items.  All in all, 4 stars and a high recommendation for families who want a central place to eat, have fun, and shop."
357,4.0,"The largest shopping mall in Seoul.  There are many stores, restaurants, cafes, cinemas, concerts,……as well as a Kimchi Museum and an Aquarium. The mall is connected to the Hyundai Department Store and at least two 5 star hotels. . You can spend half a day here, to buy, to play, to eat, to be entertained, and even to learn. A paradise for shopaholics and tourists."
358,5.0,"It's a huge mall with lot of stuffs to explore, clothing, entertainment, souvenir, food, aquarium, etc. You could easily spend a day there. We have a great time there and think it's worth a visit."
359,5.0,"The Coex is a big complex with shopping and entertainment in underground and hotels, city airport, bus terminal, hotels, casino etc on ground and other floors. The big conference complex is the main area where lot of foreigners come. It has some good restaurants. There is a bank near south gate and gives good exchange rate. Big aquarium is a good show. Some Shops allow a little bargain but most are branded."
360,5.0,We live in the home of Mall of America and were impressed by this place. I went alone the first time and then had to bring my husband back just so he could see the maze that exists below the COEX
361,4.0,"It's a Huge underground mall with many facilities from shopping center, restaurants, post office, smtown until casino. It's an integrated and connected to many building in the complex which might make us frustrated and get lost to find the way. Eventhough there are signage and information center, you might still feel confuse. But overall, it's a great place to look around and travel when you are not rushing time. Lots of International Brand exist there."
362,4.0,"This mall is located one level down from ground level in the COEX complex. Lots of different shops, though most are for clothes. To me the biggest attraction is the wide variety of restaurants offering everything from Korean staples such as Bibimbap to European and American style food."
363,4.0,"Not sure if there's a shorter way, but we had to walk quite a few blocks from the Gangnam Station exit to reach the front of this enormous mall.  Unfortunately, we arrived around eleven at night, way past the closing hour of this mall. I would have liked to get inside. Even at the late hour, you could see the interior and how big the place is.  We then went to the front after locating the new art installation for Gangnam Style, and danced like fools under the hands so we could cross off ""Dance to Gangnam Style in Gangnam"" off our bucket list. HAHAHA.  Needless to say, we got weird looks from people who looked like they were on their way home, as well as from those who just got off at the bus stop behind the monument. We also probably gave a laugh to the people manning the CCTVs. =))))"
364,2.0,"Very frustrating the way that it has been built it is quite a mess really. shops are everywhere you get lost and so spaced out , not much shops to buy from eventhough its huge took us so long from myeongdong to gangnam by taxi so much traffic and was a waste of time, not worth the visit"
365,5.0,Located in East of Kangnam area. There are many restaurants and pubs. Always crowded with young people and tourist. There cinema as well.
366,5.0,"I was an easy access from our hotel ( Oakwood premier coex) where you can find delicious food (Halal)😋, bakeries, 😘 sweets sand many 😍 shops to choose from. You can have your gifts from there like we did. 😊 Also it has an aquarium 🐠🐟🐡🐧🦀😌 which we enjoyed so much."
367,4.0,The mall is huge and has a ton of stores and restaurants. It is a great indoor activity for a rainy day. There is also an aquarium that was awesome for my young child.
368,4.0,"The mall is huge and I enjoyed walking in the mall. However, it was difficult for me to find directions. I felt that it was like a maze.There are a lot of restaurants in the mall and I particularly liked the donkatsu restaurant Saboten a lot. Because the mall is connected to Grand Intercontinental hotel and Hyundai department store, it was convenient to wonder around in all three places without having to go outside."
369,3.0,No point of interest despite being the second largest mall in asia. Layout is so confusing and and got lost a few times trying to find the food court. Too many international brand that can be found anywhere.
370,4.0,"This is the claim it makes, and many agree! Rankings aside, this place is a great place to hang out for high end brands and cosmetics in the Gangnam district (Gangnam-Gu). Took us about 25 mins by cab from city centre (CBD) and about KRW 11,000 to get there. Restaurants are great too, and the metro network has a station in the basement. Great outlets include Butter & Zara Home."
371,3.0,"This used to be one of my favourite areas to hang out in. There aren’t a large number of crowds, and the area is humongous anyway. However, I feel that the way the shops are laid out isn’t very well-planned. You’d find an area with food in one corner, walk for another 10 minutes and find another cluster of food stalls at another area. The signage/directions are rather confusing at times and the place is too big, it can be a pain if you are looking for a specific shop and realise you have to walk around 20 minutes just to get to it. The developers could have built more floors instead of having almost 95% of all the shops on the same level. There are a lot of international brands as well, so shopping isn’t particularly interesting for me. I feel that guidebooks tend to over-rate this place way too much."
372,4.0,"This complex is quite large and you can reach there either from Sports Complex Station or Bongeunsa Station. With many local or international brands, restaurants, casino, duty free shop & hotel, there is not enough signages to ensure you are on the correct way to the destination, so I have to check the digital directories from time to time."
373,4.0,"This mall is huge so u could focus on certains stalls that u are hunting for, or just shop wherever u walk to. Tried the drinks and cake at Sopresso Coffee, which were pretty good"
374,3.0,This mall was enormous! Full of expensive shops and a little less expensive shops that you see everywhere else in Seoul. The aquarium was a point of interest but we did not go because it's too much and if I wanted to see fish I'd go diving instead lol. There's a huge K-Pop shop/museum connected to it that was interesting. Our group wanted to see the Kimchi museum but it was no longer in the mall anymore.
375,2.0,"A bunch of international brands and designers with just a few korean ones. Used to be a big mall with loads of korean shops and studio ghibli store. Now it's a big mall with mostly boring shops.. Used to be worth the visit, not anymore. Now it's a great place for locals.."
376,4.0,Talk about shopping this complex is huge there are many shops and high-end trendy stores if you are on a tight budget I wouldn't come here because it's really high end restaurants and stores. It's also very large but it's also very confusing I found it very difficult to navigate so if you're willing to spend a lot of money and buy really nice high end clothing and purses and watches this is the place to be it's also very close to the subway station.... near 잠실 too!
377,2.0,"It's hell to find anything with no rhyme or reason why it's laid out the way it is. I thought it was confusing before the 2 year renovation but I was soooo wrong. They label shops by letters and numbers but it makes no sense when they intersect with each other and the arrows/signs are just wrong most of the time. Spent 20 mins looking for a restaurant in the food court but it's not a traditional courtyard style food court. It's just restaurants almost along the same row. It gets even more confusing when you add the Oakwood arcade foodcourt into the mix.  The shops aren't really anything special either. They claim no exclusives in Seoul and everything can be found in Myeongdong, Gangnam or Garosugil. The only benefit might be when it's poor weather outside since COEX is underground."
378,3.0,"I read that this was one of the largest underground malls in the world and the largest one in Asia I believe, so I had to come here. This place indeed is very big with an assortment of shops (and a random small aquarium as well!), but it's easily passable if you're tourist as there isn't anything really remarkable/memorable about it. They have an alright food court though."
379,4.0,"A very big mall, have lots and lots of shops, a very accessible to subway. There are restaurants too, anything you want under a roof."
380,4.0,This is the largest conference venue I've ever attended. You need flat shoes and be prepared for miles of walking inside!
381,3.0,"This mall is huge and mostly under ground, but it's basically just a regular shopping mall, only easier to get lost in. Worth visiting if it's raining outside or if you're looking for something specific. Not really an attraction in itself, though."
382,4.0,"I'm not usually one for crazy shopping trips while travelling, but we made Coex Mall a destination when we found out about the Gundam Base retail store cuz we're nerdy like that.  So big that it has two different KTX stops that bring you to its front doors.  It's more of an upscale mall with a great variety of popular Korean and foreign brands (Uniqlo, Roots, and some European designers are all I remember off the top of my head) as well as smaller boutique stores. Also being in a very developed area of Gangnam as well as being a destination in its own right, everything is a little bit more expensive here, especially compared to many of the other underground malls that have more stalls than built-out stores.  The food selection has a wide variety of prices and offerings so you'll find something you like for sure. The Seoul Aquarium and a movie theater are also in the mall if you're not much of the shopping type.  All in all, covering the whole mall would take about an hour of non-stop walking. While stopping in a few shops here and there, you can get through it in 2-3 hours. If you're like my girlfriend, well, you can spend the whole day here pretty easily. We did this early on in our trip to Korea so it was a nice introduction to Korean mall culture and the local style, I guess."
383,4.0,"This mall has many shops out of the ordinary, and is therefore worth a visit. Many wacky stores makes this perhaps the best place to go if you only have one day shopping in Seoul. There is a large selection of restaurants as well with a variety of foods."
384,4.0,"I'm here several time during my visit in Seoul, 2 times for SBS award shows Red Carpet and once for visiting SMtown artrium. There are few Halal restaurants here, but mostly quite pricey, so I decided to eat at Lotteria, lol. Many cool cafes and boutiques and you can check out too. Oh and every end of the year, there is an award show held in COEX convention hall, if u're lucky u can catch a glimpse of their artists walking down the red carpet. Well, I'm lucky enough to see Runningman casts and several Korean actors/actress this year :)"
385,5.0,"It's a one-stop-shop-kind-of-mall, it has everything for everyone. It has hotels connected to it, the MRT station, an aquarium for the kids, grocery, convenience store, international and local brands as well."
386,4.0,"since we were staying at insadong, it took us a while to travel down to coex mall. get off at samseong station. this part of seoul is more modern since it is located south of the han river. part of gangnam gu. we decided to visit this mall as it raining and wanted to stay indoors. this mall was touted to be the biggest underground mall in seoul. so we had to check it out ourselves. indeed it was huge with name brand outlets that we are familiar with if visiting the united states of america. i now understand why koreans shop a lot in america. branded names are quite expensive in seoul."
387,5.0,"Get off at the Samseong Station and COEX is right there. We stayed here all day walking around as it is connected to the Intercon, Oakwood Hotels, as well as the Hyundai Department Store. Lots of pricey brands and outlets, and a selection of fast food options. There is also an aquarium although we did not bother to go inside. Perfect for a rainy day or blistery weather outside."
388,3.0,"Pretty modern indoor mall (connected underground by subway). Lots of a great eats and there's a movie inside that plays the hits of the day. My goal was never to actually shop here but from the looks of it, I'd go elsewhere. Seems overpriced and in certain places, too specialized - or is that the point? There's an aquarium inside too which I was really tempted to go but I'd just eaten a bunch of sushi and didn't need a reminder that I had probably eaten Nemo."
389,3.0,"It was a huge mall with luxury boutiques. Many food outlets to choose. If you are thinking to buy something economical, you can forget about going there....I would suggest going to Myeongdong and Dongdaemun area better."
390,5.0,Nice mall with many dining options. It's in upscale business area near Intercontinental Hotel with easy access.
391,5.0,We loved this place! All restaurants and coffees were very good. And it was connected to a department store too. Especially coffees at Kona Queens - not sure the name were very lovely. We will visit again sometime soon.
392,5.0,"Had up market mall. The Best part is the Aquarium. Its approachable by two lines, green and brown. The Aquarium is must see. The shops are a bit costly but you could find some often most fashionable stuff here"
393,5.0,"We took a $12 US cab ride from Insadong to COEX Mall. We walked in and followed the signage to the City Airport Transit. Only travelers on certain airlines may use this service. We were traveling on Korean Airlines, which was one of the associated airlines. We checked in our luggage, got our seating assignment and boarding passes, then, went upstairs next to the Airport Limo Bus waiting area in a section called ""Arrivals"". There were lockers to rent for about $3 -$4 US for 6 hours. We stored our hand carry luggage there. My husband is interested in tea, and lucky for him, there was a huge Tea Exhibit in one of the conference halls. We spent several hours there admiring exquisite displays of tea cups, ceramics and tea pots that were impressive! Some of the artists were there serving tea in their bowls. There was a plethora of teas and everything related to tea. We saw a tea ceremony performance and talked to so many people. When you're there, check out what conferences and exhibits are held--you may be lucky like us! We left because I was starving! There were so many restaurants to choose from in the mall. We saw an eyeglass shop and had heard that eyeglasses were reasonable in Korea, so, we checked it out and got some spiffy glasses as our souvenir! They were professional there, checking our eyes against our prescriptions and I was glad that we went there rather than a shop on the streets. The mall kept going on and on with an Aquarium, movie theatres, shopping, shopping and more shopping. We had planned to walk across the street to Bongeusa Temple for tea, but, we were tea'd out after that fabulous Tea Exhibit. We found our way back to our lockers using the well-marked signage, then, bought the Airport Limo Bus ticket (about $17 US each). The ride took a little over an hour and dropped us off on the 3rd floor at the airport where we could skip the long lines and go through the City Airport Transit line. Wonderful experience!"
394,4.0,Huge mall! It's very easy to get lost so definitely grab a map. It's a pretty standard mall with some fun stores. Check out Butter for kitschy household items and souvenirs. The Hyundai department store is a must see. It's 11 stories and filled with high priced boutique stores. It's fun just for the experience. The mall has a ton of restaurants in and around the food court. They are all fairly quick so you could easily eat here on break from a conference.
395,4.0,"Coex Mall houses quite a lot of shops. It is connected to the Hyundai Department Store. In the mall is also a casino. Did not check it out so won't be able to comment.  More importantly, it is connected to the City Airport where you can check in your flights and baggages in advance.  To get there, take the metro to Samseong Station and exit at exit 5 or 6."
396,3.0,"The mall itself seemed very average to me. Yes, there are a lot of stores, most aren't high end, and most aren't low end, just somewhere in between. The lay out of the mall is very maze like. At times I wasn't sure where I was going.  But, somehow the mall connected into the Hyundai Department Store. Since this is located in Gangnam, the first two floors are dedicated to luxury shopping. And I do mean ""high end"". This Hyundai Department Store is the best in Seoul! And they have a food court on the lower level.  Is the mall still worth going to..........it sure is. There are lots of other things to do there. Shopping, Casino, Aquarium, lots of restaurants, and a Cinema. You could spend the whole day here.  Strictly Shopping - 2 Stars Besides Shopping - 4 Stars Hyundai Department Store - 5 Stars"
397,4.0,"Decided to see their casino and play some slots...sorts fun, but do NOT expect anything resembling Vegas. The mall has tons of shops. Stopped for lunch at Bulgogi Brothers, a chain restaurant. Bibimbap was 8/10."
398,5.0,"COEX Mall looks very futuristic from the inside, a maze of ways to go with a huge Cinema, Aquarium, food court and dozens od stores to shop in. Easy access to Hyundai Department store as well."
399,5.0,It's a big mall with an attached convention center and aquarium. It has got all the international brands and has great ambiance. It is also attached to a metro station making it very easy to access. Great place to shop and spend a few hours.
400,5.0,Wow biggest mall I have been in . There is a aquarium inside a cinema and heaps of shops . You can get lost but there is everything and every brand you can think of .
401,5.0,"COEX mall is so huge that it is divided into different sections.. i'm quite a map nerd.. so during my trip with my sister.. we literally got lost.. hahahaha.. we are unable to comb the entire area because we have no idea which part have we went and which part we didn't.. because it's just too huge.. just like any other shopping malls.. a lot of shops to shop around.. a lot of makan place to eat in.. not sure about cafes but we do find one to chit chat and enjoy the cakes while taking time to rest from the long hours of walking.. will revisit it again when we're back to Korea and hopefully this time round we can comb every single section and every area of the shopping mall.. c"",)"
402,5.0,"It is large and maze-like enough to get lost in.  There are nice stores and lots of cafes and good restaurants.  And then there is a huge Hyundai department store. The first level of Hyndai mall is like a big kitchen with treats from all over the world. It has lots of bakeries selling awesome treats like cheese cakes and other desserts and fruits., And you can find every luxurious brand under the Sun in on other levels this mall. The maze and the vastness of the mall allows you to wander around aimlessly!! The mall is connected to three five star hotels Oakwood, Intercontinental and Gran Intercontinental. It seems there is also an aquarium closeby. I cudnt visit that. So walk around, shop, eat and tire urself!!"
403,5.0,"If you're in the market for a ""cool"" ""mall"" – and assuming there is such a thing – in Seoul, then Coex should make you happy. It is large and maze-like enough to get lost in.  There are nice stores you don't often find in Seoul – Brooks Brothers Black Label, Molton Brown, GAP + GAP Kids, Nike, Addidas, Kiels, Marimekko, a bunch of other cool clothing shops, cool home decor shops, a Gundam Robot shop and TONS of cafes and good restaurants.  And that's not even including the Hyundai department store. If you venture around to the bottom of the Hyundai department store, there are lots of bakeries selling awesome treats, a shop selling the best Korean mochi treats (dduk) that I have found in Seoul – including one with white cake crumbs which tastes like birthday cake that my whole family absolutely loves, a good wine shop and a cool place to find interesting kitchen items from around the world.  … so… if you're looking for a day to wander around aimlessly indoors… a place that will keep everyone in the whole family happy… yeah… give Coex a wander.  Also there usually seems to be some sort of a special event or pop up store event happening here, so you never know what you'll bump into."
404,4.0,"Huge mall in Korea. Good for mall goers & those who come to Korea mostly for shopping. When I say huge I'm not kidding, means a lot of walking. Decided to take a stop here after a day of exploring, was curious about the Aquarium since I had time to spare. Looked down the long hallway & was just ""Nope, my feet hurt I've been walking all day. I'm done"" LoL other than that the parts of the mall I did see were good."
405,3.0,It's a big mall. It's very modern. You can find everything and nothing at the same time. It's way too big. As a tourist this was not for me. I think it doesn't showcase the Korean culture. I don't know. I'm not a mall person I just came here because I had to see it for myself since it was my first time in Korea and it was on my way back from gangnam.  Skip this place if you don't have much time in Seoul. Come here if you have plenty of time.
406,5.0,"So while the others in our group rather circled in the part of the city on the left coast of river Han, we ( my wife and I ) decided to go across the river and visit some interesting sites in, I may say, more modern region of so dense populated metropole, as it is Seoul. To get on the right coast of the river Han, we had taken a subway tram, whose line is not put deep beneath the ground level, that is, we had a ride with so called ""light metro"". We crossed the Dongbu Bridge and in Gangnam-gu region got to the very exciting place, called Coex Mall. That is an underground big shopping mall. There are here many conventions centers, exhibitions halls, many malls with plenty of shops. Then, passing by these attractive shops, we got to the food courts with traditional korean food. Along with such pleasant stores, we found also the couple of movie theatres, COEX Aquarium, a large book store and even one Museum. You can use the Seoul Metro Line 2, to arrive there. Not so far from the Coex Mall is located Samsoeng Complex, that is very worth to be seen."
407,3.0,Complicated layout but in case I really have enough time for shopping while drifting from one shop to another you will find anything you want :)
408,4.0,"I liked COEX Mall before the renovation. It was smaller and had more of a vibe. Now it's huge but lacks any imagination. On a weekday it feels empty due to its expansiveness. On weekends, it's better. Unless you're there to watch a movie or visit the aquarium, there isn't much to do but shop and eat. I guess that's fine for most but I for kids, it can be a bit boring."
409,4.0,"The mall is massive. Very close to park hyatt hotel and attached to the station. It has an aquarium, movie theater and a food court. Many brand shops but very expensive in-comparison to other places. Good place to enjoy and rest after a long business meeting."
410,4.0,"Been to this mall countless times before it was renovated and reopened. The mall has been greatly improved, with the addition of more stores, restaurants, etc. which help avoid rainy afternoons outside. For the Kpop fans there is now a store solely for SM Entertainment music."
411,4.0,huge mall with a wide variety of shops. Good restaurants but quiet expensive. its quiet far from the city but convinient from the subway. The duty free shop there was quiet off putting.
412,4.0,"I spent a week working in the Trade Tower in Seoul. I happened to stay in the COEX Intercontinental, and I was shown 'the way' to walk from one to the other through the COEX Mall. The first day I was overwhelmed with the commercialism, but then as the week wore on, the COEX mall became a friend providing warmth, sustinence and entertainment for me as a solo business traveler in a strange land.  HOLLYS COFFEE: Can't find it on the map, but it's worth a visit. I have never before had a Dutch Baby at a restaurant (they're a family favorite to make at a shindig) and it was good (not great). The coffee was very good, better to my palate than Star*ucks).  I also ate at Kervan one night, sushi for lunch, found some skin products at one store, and found groceries to stash in my hotel room at the Hyundai basement store.  The entertainment was watching the very young, very hip K-POP population meandering the mall in massive crowds at all times of day and night.  The surrounding area is not bad to walk, and had some nice sculptures. Quite urban, noisy, not really pedestrian-fun, but not unfriendly to walkers either."
413,2.0,"I used to visit COEX regularly before the much needed renovation. Often for the Mexican restaurant (now shunted outside the complex), COEX had a charm about it, was always busy and had plenty of great looking young people wandering around. After returning to Korea I was excited to see that it had reopened and I ventured back only to find a sterile, brightly lit, overpriced and not very busy abomination. If you can imagine a sprawling airport duty free shopping experience, without the bargains then you've no need to visit. They killed COEX!"
414,4.0,Not a big fan of mall (more my wifes thing) but still pretty fascinating. Would be especially good if you had small feet and needed shoes....
415,3.0,"Very big, we found it confusing and not well organized. The general feeling at the mall was not fun but very busy. All in all, not worth the visit. We only went there since it os right next to the temple."
416,3.0,"When I was in Seoul last year, January, COEX Mall was closed for renovation. Since I was here again, but this time on business, it was convenient for me to visit as I was staying at Park Hyatt, plus there isn't much choice staying around this part of Seoul. And I don't have time not energy to visit the more diverse shopping areas after work.  There are many retail shops; restaurants and cafes are plentiful too, but they don't come cheap, so be prepared to spend.  I was here during early spring when it can still be quite freezing at times, so shopping underground, staying indoor worked well for me. But I know some people absolutely hate it coz it can be pretty claustrophobic.  Don't need to make a deliberate trip here, but if you are around the neighborhood, why not just swing by."
417,4.0,"This mall is recently renovated and it shows. It is very clean and organized. Very modernized. Has a huge variety of shops and food selections you can choose from. Although a lot of the shops sell high end products that are not cheap, I would only recommend if you have a few more days in Seoul, or near the temple close by."
418,3.0,"I found the mall to be very large and easy to walk around. Did not pay much attention to prices, but just the experience of being there was enough for me."
419,4.0,"The COEX mall is under the COEX exhibition hall. It also comes with an aquarium but I did not visit that area. The entrance is conveniently located near the Samseong metro exit. Some days they have musicians performing in the mall. A lot of American Branded stores can be found here such as Levis, Nike, Adidas etc. The prices are a little higher than US MSRP, so if you're looking for a deal, this is not the best place to get it."
420,3.0,"Overrated. Overpriced. Lots of nice, but a bit pricey, restaurants. Aquarium was ok for kids but a bit boring for me as an adult. On place that was cool had bobble head making computer, but you had to wait 7 days to get the finished product, which sucks if you don't have time. I wouldn't go back."
421,1.0,"Don't bother to visit the mall. It's a pure waste of time. All those shops that they have at the mall, they can be found else where too. The only plus point - lots of restaurants that you can choose from."
422,3.0,I'm never sure how to review something like this. It is a mall. There are a lot of shops selling a lot of things you can buy in a lot of other places. I don't know why I'd buy these things in this location. The best feature of the mall are the bevy of restaurants that it has.
423,2.0,"Part of the mall is still under renovation, hence there isn't much to shop here. No doubt it is huge, very spacious, but wait till it is fully renovated. Most brands in this mall can be found at other huge shopping malls or departmental stores."
424,2.0,This place was so talked up in all the guide books and online but it's really just a very spaced out mall. All of the shops you can see anywhere else in the world and that makes it pretty much like any other mall.
425,3.0,"The mall is located near the Samseong Metro station. This mall failed to impress us for numerous reasons. First of all, it's completely underground and feels totally claustrophobic. Secondly, it's incomplete and large parts of it are still being built. But most importantly - we visited the mall during the summer and parts of it (especially the parts still being built and renovated) were not air-conditioned. This resulted in unbearable temperatures inside the mall and the lack of ventilation plus the mass of people there made the entire experience uncomfortable, to say the least. While there are a lot of eateries around the malls, an aquarium, many shops, cinemas and pharmacies, we still could not escape but feel its gloomy atmosphere."
426,3.0,We came when the Coex Mall was still undergoing renovation. Nothing to see except the Aquarium which was really expensive and looks small. So we did not go.
427,4.0,"I was just here a week ago and while they're still finishing up some construction, most of the shops have moved in.  There's a food court with lots of different food, a wide variety of big brands (Versace, AJ, Kiehls, etc) along with some local korean stores (mostly along the corridor to the food court). There is also an A Land + Art Box.  What I liked most about this mall was that it was right underneath the Grand Intercontinental Parnas, and it's easy to just go down and grab a bite to eat. I believe the Oakwood and Intercontinental Coex is attached to it as well.  The Coex also connects to the Parnas Mall which mostly a few restaurants and like 4 stores. It also connects to the Samsung subway station and the Hyundai Department store. There is a movie theater + Coex Aquarium located inside."
428,3.0,"I was there at the end of Nov, days after their official opening date of Nov 27th. The mall is huge and it was pretty decent. There are still lot of store spaces to be filled and lot of restaurants to be open by early December, per signs at the doors. The Hyundai department store is worth to check out, mostly their food section in the basement. I think it's a good place to do shopping and eat. I didn't go to the aquarium or the movie theater so I don't know if they are worth the visit."
429,2.0,I was here during the grand opening on 27 November. Most of the stores weren't open and the stores that were open were still moving in. Wait until the renovations are done before shopping here. It's not worth it.
430,2.0,"Went in 3 times at around 8pm in evening and all 3 times found the mall to be in a closed type of condition - No people, most shops closed and hardly anything to see."
431,3.0,I don't know if part of the mall was closed or something since it seemed very small and there were not that many stores. In addition the stores were uninteresting so we just walked through the whole place and did not do any shopping.
432,4.0,"This mall includes numerous shops, four food courts ( mostly Korean food ), the excellent, high end Hyundai Department Store, a multiplex cinema, exhibition halls and an aquarium. We stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel here so, often went walking in the Mall and had a quick lunch in the food hall or Hyundai Department Store."
433,3.0,"We went there to shop because we heard it's one of the best malls in Korea, but unfortunately about 85% of it was under renovation, and they said it may take about 1 year till it will be fully open. So we end up getting in the aquarium, then we had lunch in the same mall and we get out. So if you are to go there, make sure it's fully open."
434,4.0,"I had a convention on COEX and I had little chance to visit the mall. Before I came to Seoul I heard that COEX mall is one the famous indoor shopping mall. But when I visited there, they were having renovation. Most of the shops were closed. Hmmm... But still you can find some shops opened. It would be very convenient if the weather is bad. But it's worth vising for those of you who have conference or business in COEX but if not, I recommend you to visit Garosu-gil instead."
435,4.0,"Coex mall is attached to the convention center and to the subway. It's huge, has great food options, an aquarium and a movie theatre. However, there is still some construction going on and the place is really a maze. Also very crowded around lunch."
436,3.0,"Very nice mall in Gangnum street and next to Samsung station(subway) well knonwn station. The mall is srounded with 2 Intercontinantal Hotel, Grand Intercontinantal (Old), and Intercontinantal Coex (new). both hotels are connected directily to this mall.  Best of This Mall Is: 1-Burger B Restaurant 2-Coex Aquiream 3- Anime and module toys store( i forgat the name but it is infront of the Aquiream) 4- CGV Cinemas  It has a CGV cinemas, a big Aquirem for the famliy and kids, some korean Resturents and some Brands for shopping."
437,2.0,Right now the COEX Mall is undergoing a massive renovation. At least 80% of the facility is closed. The English handouts state it will reopen in December 2014.  What's left isn't bad but... There are other Malls in Seoul worth visiting in the meantime.
438,3.0,is aniland open or the sanrio shop? im thinking of going there so ya. otherwise ive passed by a few times and was stunned of how big it is. its underground so i cant say much
439,4.0,"I went to the COEX Mall last Sunday. It is conveniently located above Samseong MRT station. Part of the mall was undergoing renovations but there were still many shops open. There is a good variety of restaurants there- Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, Western, etc. I saw many people in their twenties (mostly young couples) at COEX so if you are a young person you will probably enjoy the atmosphere there."
440,3.0,"It is a very large and imposing underground shopping mall that shares the same facility as an exhibition hall.  There were many shopsfront but many were closed, not opened or boarded up. The other mainly sold more of skincare brands and some accessories. I was looking for clothes/ fashion outlets but there were not much at the point in time.  It is rather disappointing, and the price here was not too good either. As least not when comparing to Myeodeong or the Women's University. A pity as well, since this place is huge and rather new and clean, so it would have made for a good shopping paradise.

441,5.0,"Hello everyone,  I always use this application, when I go abroad,  so I guess you'll see my review, before you come to Samgsung road.  Actually I'm Korean, and I live in the Samsung road(10 minutes by walk from COEX.)  My grade for Coex is 5stars, because there are many wonderful restaurants, and shops, and etc.  But not now.  From 2013, Coex mall is on a remodelling, so if you come here, you can use just 2 services.  First one is a mega box theater, and 2nd one is a aquarium.  I think, It's a terrible season for you to come here.  For me, I live in here so I go there to see a moive, but you don't have to see the movie here in Korea.  Instead of Coex mall,  I recommand you some sites.  1st one is 경복궁., which is a royal palace of CHOSUN dynasty.  You can see the Korean traditonal structures, and traditional clothes of royal family.  2nd is Insa-dong, where you can drink Korean-tea, and see the gallery.  3rd one is 동대문 시장, which is an cheap market for clothes, and sports equipments.  4th is 명동, the downtown of Seoul.  You can see the cathedral, and korean traditional market, and may complex marts.  I think, You can shop here, instead of Coex.  5th is 이태원, this is a road for foreigners. You can go by the subway line no.6, so It's very easy to find it.  There are may restaurants of western foods, and pub& clubs are in 이태원.  So I reccomend you to go there in the night.  Next is 삼청동.  It's a little bit expensive, but there are may beautiful cafes, and delicious Korean restuarants.  My last reccomendation is 여의도.  It's a little island, in the Han-river, and in 여의도, there is a nice river side park.  You can jog along the river.(Beer & Chicken will be a perfect selection. You can odrer by phone at the park.)  And for the restuarant,  I'll say just one thing.  Please stop by the 팔색삼겹살, in 신촌(sinchon).  It's very popular Korean pork bbq restuarant, and so many Japanese love this restaurant.  I believe that you'll be satisfied.  That's all.  I post this review,  just because I see so many foriegners in the Coex these days,  and everyone was dissapointed.  So I can tell you, not to come Coex, until 2014.(The remodelling""ll be finished on 2014.)  Thank you."
442,1.0,"Or it might as well be closed. There are miles (kilometers) of boarded-up shops. Signs everywhere stating that the mall is being refurbished, sorry for any inconvenience... Only a few restaurants are open, the movie theater is open, and I think the aquarium is open. All else is just boarded-up, empty hallways that seem to stretch to infinity. And then when you get to the end of an empty hallway, you turn the corner to see... another empty hallway. Not sure how long this refurbishment is going to take, but I would not suggest anybody visit Coex mall in 2014. It seems to be a huge construction site, not something that will be finished in a few months... The picture (attached to this review) is about the most exciting thing you will see at Coex mall, right now..."
443,2.0,"We went there because it claims as ""The Largest Underground Shopping Mall in Asia"". We curious to find out. Unfortunately, it was not as we expected, it was faaaaarrr from our expectations. Only few stores and restaurants were open, the Coex Aquarium, Megabox Cinema, and Lotte Duty Free. That's it! We walked for like 2,4km back and forth to find a practically EMPTY mall. On our way back to the subway station there were a big banner that we missed before, it said ""WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCONVENIENT, WE ARE CLOSED DUE TO RENOVATION. WE WILL BE RE-OPEN ON NOVEMBER 2014"". And we were rolling on the floor laughing for our ""unfortunate event"" =))"
444,3.0,"Very huge mall with many shopping as well. But we didn't shop much as most are retail and departmental stores. They're better shopping areas like hongdae, ewha uni etc. We came to COEX mall for Marche, as it's world's no.1 marche which serves buffet! One pax for 23000W, what a good deal! And it's near Lotte World as well. I would recommend coming here if you're heading to Lotte World to have the marche buffet, if not probably not worth coming to the end of Jamsil Station. If you've visited my profile, you will read more details in my blog. xx"
445,4.0,"The venue was quite huge and massive. On arrival I was left on my own to reach the venue for the IYCC JUDGES BRIEFING SEMINAR! I nearly walked the length and breadth of the battiment, No help as they could not speak english! They place is well organized and equipped. The mall is filled with brand options and well maintained. If you know where to go witha korean spezking guide, sure you will enjoy if you not rather spend your whole time searching!"
446,1.0,"This is just a standard mall. Lousy and dull. (I came here for a conference)  Why on earth in beautiful Asia they're going to copy the worst ideas that the West had in the last 60 years????  Go to a traditional market and eat in one of the thousands of small places throughout the town. They even have burger King, Starbucks and Dunkin doughnuts. What's wrong with them??? A coffee and a croissant there is going to cost like a full lunch elsewhere!"
447,4.0,"I've been to this mall a thousand and one times during my two-year tour in Korea. It is a fantastic place with TONS of shopping and things to do. It has a mediocre arcade, a nice aquarium, a great movie theater, a hotel, a convention center, and countless other things to do. The place is so big, I got lost the first couple times I went there. I was wandering around and would suddenly find myself in a hotel or something. The subway leads directly to the mall (literally, you walk out of the station, you're in the mall), just get off at Samseong station. Best if you bring a friend who is familiar with the place."
448,1.0,"Decidied to take advantage of a rainy day by visiting the Coex Mall for a spot of shop and drop retail therapy.  It wasn't until I arrived on Subway line 2 Coex Mall (World Trade Centre) stop and wandered through the maze of boarded gangways that I became aware it was under refurbishment and only a handful of shops were open, alongside the Mega Box Cinema, a few restaurants, and the slightly fishy smelling Aquarium that initially had me thinking the loo's needed a good cleaning...you can imagine my disapointment as I navagated myself back through the maze of boarded gangways looking for the light of freedom empty handed wishing I hadn't bothered to visit.  With this in mind, my advice would be to avoid until refurbishment is complete....when this will be is anyones guess!!"
449,4.0,It was a nice place very large we took our son to the Aquarium there for his Birthday to celebrate him turning 2! Check it out its nice!
450,1.0,"If i had known it was under renovation i would have avoided this place. It is a walkathon at best. Shop choices are hopeless, things selling inside are limited. Air conditioning is very weak and you feel suffocated. It is not the shopping Mecca it is made out to be. At least not in its current state. Wait till renovation complete before considering."
451,2.0,"Not even sure why I went there, one of the guys who was traveling with wanted to go for what ever reason. Needless to say, I did not enjoyed the place. It was crowded, smelly, and super hot. Unless you enjoy shopping, I don't see why you need to go. One positive about the place, we found a very good local restaurant. It was very cheap as well.  Happy shopping if you enjoy doing so."
452,5.0,"What can you do it Coex? Whatever you can imagine.. Shop (both luxury and cheaper brands), Eat & Drink, Movie, Play, Spa, Casino, Aquarium, even get a transportation to airports...etc  COEX mall is massive..also it is connected to Hyundai Department Store, Samsung City Airport Terminal, 2 InterContinental Hotels (Grand InterContinental & InterContinental Coex), Oakwood Premier Coex Center (Residence/Hotel), 7Luck Casino, Lotte Dutyfree Shop...etc. The mall also has MegaBox movie theater and Aquarium.  For the people with little kids, it is a challenge to walk about and find things in this massive place. However, the mall does offer strollers for the little ones. As you enter into the mall from Samsung Station, (the far right door, that is next to Marche restaurant), keep walking down the main street till you see a information desk that is kind of right before the escalators. You can borrow strollers (I think this service requrs your ID card) from there.  Trust me...this will really help you to enjoy the place pleasantly with your little ones."
453,5.0,"Very convenient as going through this location I have done with my duty free shopping, cinema, gadget browsing, the COEX Aquarium, attending conventions (such as the 1st Korean Style Week) and right across it is the Bongeunsa Temple, where you can lose half a day or more without noticing except for your really tired feet :)"
454,3.0,"Coming all the way from Myeongdong, I took the subway to get to Coex and Bongeunsa Temple. Armed with a map and the directions I got from the KTO website, I just followed it and emerged in front of a group of buildings that includes COEX MALL and World Trade Bldg. At the other end of the block, after a lot of walking (I was on my own DIY adventure with the map so I was looking like a lost little person), I found the Bongeunsa Temple on the other side of the street. The pedestrian lane connects Coex to the temple fronting each other. I wanted to see that temple where the Korean actor Lee Min Ho emerged from (particularly the Buddha Statue within the temple) in his KDrama 'Faith'. Going back, I ate lunch at Coex food court, found DunkinDonut for coffee."
455,4.0,"The COEX is an underground shopping mall that boasts many brand-name stores, boutiques and gourmet eateries. The Mall is conveniently connected to two Intercontinental hotels, and the famous Hyundai Department Store. it has a multi-cinema complex and an aquarium."
456,3.0,"I thought this place was pretty big, unlike some reviewers.i worried about going too far and getting lost. Lots of places to eat, lots of variety in the shopping, and nicely interconnected with the surrounding buildings, sure, renovations were happening, but its still enormous. It was really busy on Saturday! I liked it."
457,2.0,"It is a very large and empty mall, rampling and expensive, with unatractive atractions. Only good thing: ends in Hyundai food court"
458,2.0,"I thought this mall was amazing, as it is the biggest mall in Seoul... Well, the mall really needs some renovations. Floors and lights are old-fashioned and weird. Shops are not special at all!"
459,4.0,"This mall is big and busy. The bathrooms are really nice and colorful. I liked shopping here. I bought some jewelry, ate some ice cream and window shopped for the most part. Had to mime a bit,and practice some of my very limited Korean since most of the vendors did not speak fluent English but that is the fun in it all."
460,2.0,"I visited the COEX mall after reading great reviews. Unfortunately there are major renovations happening until early 2014, and as a result there is not a lot to do. There are still some shops open, as well as the acquarium and cinemas, but there are better shopping areas available in Seoul. I think this will all be rectified when the renovations are complete"
461,1.0,"After reading all the rave online reviews of coex mall, we decided to visit it.But our visit was quite a letdown.The mall was pretty empty and looked quite outdated.Aside from the aquarium and duty free shop, there was really nothing much to see.Would recommend that you only visit this place if there are any ongoing exhibitions or showcases otherwise it is not worth the time."
462,4.0,There is a small Lotte Duty Free shop which is much quieter than other department stores in the city centre. There are also many restaurants to chose from for a quiet coffee or a hearty lunch/dinner.

464,1.0,"After visiting Lotte Myeongdong the night before, we went to Coex with anticipation. Coex Mall was huge with a few malls and departmental stores joined together in the underpass. However, the place had just begun its refurbishment when we visited and many shops and restaurants were closed since end Mar. Megabox cineplex, the Aquarium, Lotte Duty Free and the big bookstore were still opened. There were only limited local dining options. Coex looked like a mall from the 80s. The public bathrooms stink. Yes, Coex NEEDS the refurbishment.  We were quite disappointed by the Coex experience, really. Wish the hotel concierge could have told us and saved us the time (45 mins in evening peak traffic) to cab there from Gangbuk."

Reasonably priced, great bargains galore and great eating experience. Don't expect high end stores to be within the area, but then again, you can look into great bargains of products that are quite lovely. I thought I could cover the place in an hour's time, ended up staying for 4 hours :)"
466,4.0,"This is huge! A lot of shopping and you'll need a full day just to walk, shop, eat and visit the aquarium and kimchi museum. Its actually connected to the subway exit so its easy to get to. The food is excellent. Although the ladies working in the korean restaurant we went to doesn't speak english, they were still very helpful and nice. The prices are reasonable too."
467,5.0,COEX Mall was huge and right at the subway location which was convenient.  There was a lot of clothes shops and they were a pretty good price. Loved shopping there!! The Coex Aquarium is on the bottom floor but there was a bad smell the day we went. Not sure if it was something to do with the aquarium or not but we did not end up going coz of the smell.  There is a very large bookstore/stationery shop in the centre of the mall which is great for book lovers!! There were show displays too! They were having a Samsung Galaxy Note event when we went and we just sat down and joined even though we didn't understand what they were saying. They spoke some english which was nice~ There was giveaways and my friend got a phone holder ^^  They do have fan-signings and press events there too which was cool.  So if you love shopping then this is the place to go!! Plus its all indoors~
468,4.0,"The COEX Mall is located in the Gangnam section of Seoul. If you are in the center of Seoul, like the Insadong or Myeongdong areas, take the number 3 subway line (orange) to Seoul National University of Education stop, and change for the number 2 line (green) and go to the Samseong station. The mall is connected to this station and the directions will lead you to the mall. The mall is underground from the Korean World Trade Center, and very large stretching for many blocks underground. Also located in this complex are the Intercontinental Hotel and the Park Hyatt Hotel. The mall has stores for all tastes from economical to luxury. There are a huge amount of restaurants from Western to Asian, and an Aquarium and the Kimchi Museum. The layout of the mall is relaxed with plenty of space and although there may be many people there, it never feels crowded. A worthwhile visit especially on a rainy day when you need something to do. It also has a 16 screen cinema."
469,3.0,"the Haundae dept store is good for western gifts. I found a good sushi store there. Most of the stores seem overpriced, except for the restaurants."
470,3.0,"This is a huge mall with almost anything a person would need. It is very convenient if you live in the area, but nothing special."
471,4.0,"I was at the COEX for a conference and only on my last day did I discover the large sprawling complex underneath the entire region. Lot of good average stores, some brand name fashion and some unique breaking in fashion, along with souvenir stores and a good selection of restaurants, some associated with the Intercontinental hotels above."
472,4.0,"Well, it's a mall, so it's not earth-shattering. It ha a massive selection of stores sprawled across the area, mostly underground with very little natural light. The layout can be a little confusing at first but the interactive maps are great."
473,2.0,"Shops shops everywhere but not a single one is interesting. We went and settled for the casino instead. It's a maze down there and the only beacon is the subway sign. We did not dare to venture away from the subway direction since we nearly got lost.  Noted that there are no proper shops nor sections of a department store that sell toys. Even if we find one, the selection is ""private limited"". Wonders what the Korean kids grow up with....iPad? Samsung tablet?"
474,4.0,"Fun place! Watch a Korean movie, people watch, eat well! Wide assortment of clothes/bags/shoes but electronics could be better.  Easy to get lost. Helpful touch maps at strategic points to get oriented. Wish there were more benches to lounge about."
475,4.0,"We went to the COEX mall via#2 subway line from Lotte World Hotel; three stops and only cost 3300 Won/$3 USD roundtrip for each person. Plenty of stores in this underground shopping mall, and we had lunch at one of Japanese restaurants. Weekdays would be the best time to go; less crowded and decent price for food. The mall opened at 1030 hrs, some stores did not open until 1100 hrs. I forgot the name of the coffee shop (Beans and something) located in the mall; the establishment has an enclosed area for smokers,pretty cool with automatic door (similar to the smoking room at Incheon airport). Overall, we like the COEX, more shops and cheaper than Lotte Dept Store or Lotte Mart."
476,4.0,"Its a super big mall and one can easily get lost in it. Good thing is that there's a lot of shops. But because of the big mall's layout, you tend to have to walk a lot to get from one place to another. Can get quite tiring. There's quite a number of eateries in it. In case you're craving for your usual fast food, this is definitely where you can get them. Some off the top of my head are Macdonalds and KFC. You can get almost anything in this mall, ranging from duty free shops, clothes, stationery, shoes, and so on. It's definitely worth a visit if you have some spare time and would like to do a little shopping and explore this vast mall."
477,4.0,"If you have only a few days to stay in Seoul and would like to see different part of it (from places like Namdaemoon or Myungdong), Coex mall is the place to go. Located in the middle of one of the most expensive land of Seoul, everything is expected to be a bit more pricey. Nevertheless, you can shop, eat, sight-see all in the underground mall! You may notice that the crowd is younger, more-hip, and maybe even richer. Good place to people-watch! ;-)"
478,5.0,You'll never get tired of walking around this mall... great shops and of course a lot of restos too!!!
479,5.0,"I was wondering where all the Seoul people go on a Sunday until I entered the COEX mall in Gangnam. On a raining Sunday, the COEX mall was filled with people. There are upscale department store right along side with all kinds of boutique stores, as well as theaters in the mall. The COEX mall is connected to the Samseong metro station. You can find digital map at the mall entrances as well as along the mall. Remember to select the language you desire in order to read the map. The information desk and small stand along a few corners also have map in Japanese, Chinese, and English.  There are a few run of the mill restaurants in the COEX mall, as well as a few very elegent ones, all depends on ones mood. But be forewarned, if you go to COEX on a weekend or holiday, be prepared for long lines at any restaurant. I saw many locals grabbed a bite and the 7-11 inside the mall because the restaurants are too crowded.  The mall is very clean despite heavy traffic. Skip the kimchi museum because no one goes there (admission fee 3000w which is around $3). The food court inside the department store is very popular and worth a try."
480,4.0,"There are all sorts of shops for clothes, electronics, etc., but visitors to the convention center will probably be most interested in the restaurants, such as the many Korean, Japanese, but also McDonalds, Burger King, Quiznos, coffee shops, Starbucks, etc. It is especially convenient when it is raining outside as one does not have to leave the convention center part in order to eat a meal. However, at most times of days there are lots of people, and at dinner one may have to wait 45 minutes for a seat at a restaurant like Mr. Pizza."
481,4.0,Coex mall is a must visit if you are targeting mid range shopping. The place is really huge and easy to get lost. But every now and then there is a information counter. The shops are trendy and restaurant are every where for ur meal. U can easily spend one day here. I use to make this place my base when I visit korea. The place is less crowded and transportation is easy.
482,5.0,Very clean and plenty of shops and restaurants to choose from. Cafe Pascucci is a nice place to have coffee.
483,3.0,"This mall located far from downtown but easy to get to by metro. you can check out the aquarium, kimchi museum, and the ancient temple across the street. it is lower than my expectation when i get there. you cannot really go around in a circle from the mall layout. the kimchi museum is even located on the parking lot level and is hard to find. There is a lotte duty free shop in this mall."
484,5.0,"The COEX truly justifies the meaning of a Mall-It's huge,has lots of shopping and fooding options,seamlessly connected to the beautifully efficient Metro rail system.It would make sense to pick up a mall map,so that you don't get lost.In case of any problem,the best person to talk to are the efficient,English speaking Customer Assistance officers,manning booths at all levels of the Mall.A gigantic book store is the attraction of the Mall.Starbucks and other cafes would ensure you are charged up after crisscrossing the Mall."
485,5.0,If you prefer Malls over Department stores the Coex Mall is the place to be!!
486,5.0,"Whatever you are looking for in Seoul, you can find it here. There must be over a thousand stores. Be sure to leave breadcrumbs so that you can find your way out."
487,4.0,"Cool place to check out, been to Korea 3 times now and the Coex is always a must go. Seems like there is always new things to find..big place"
488,5.0,"Coex mall is a nice place to walk around and enjoy looking at the shops, going to a movie, having a snack or a meal, watching the people, looking at the fashions and in general spending some time. There are individual restaurants and a nice food court where I have enjoyed eating on a number of occasions. I felt the shops and boutiques were rather highly priced so I don't usually buy goods there."
489,3.0,"The Aquarium is excellent! But the shops and restaurants are a bit pricey. It's good to go there when the weather is bad. Otherwise, Myongdong is a better choice for shopping."
490,4.0,"The Coex Mall has just about everything you could imagine a mall having. Clothing ranges from Designer to Discount, they have a supermarket, pharmacy, movie and live theater venues. And an amazing buffet 30,000 won gets you all you can eat and drink (including alcoholic beverages)"
491,4.0,"This is a very popular place, but I'm yet to work out why. There are a lot of shops and restaurants so I guess it's a good place to combine the two. Modern and a popular venue for events such as the G20 last year, there are often things to do, along with a Kimchee Museum for those who want to know more about Korea's most famous food!"
492,3.0,large mall with wide variety of stores. mall directory can be better. not impressed with interior design. some places of the mall feels old
493,2.0,"It's vast. I mean, I'm no physicist, but this complex seems to expand outward in every direction, approaching infinity. And the crowds are almost apocalyptic. However, I'm not really excited by the crush of a mega mall experience. To anyone who gets fired up over a frenzy of consumer energy, this is the place. It has a respectable aquarium, an above average number of name brand franchises, a decent food court and a CGV movie theater. It also straddles the Samseong Station on Seoul Metro Line #2.  If you want an injection of weapons grade retail therapy then COEX will do the job. If, on the other hand, you were just trying to meet some friends or grab a couple of items off your shopping list, then you might consider a smaller shopping center.  Note: I went with two children - 3 years and 1 year old respectively. COEX had many ""children friendly"" areas, but the end result was over-stimulation and some seriously cranky kids."
494,4.0,"If you like shopping then this is a venue for you! Amost everything under one roof! Put on a decent pair of walking shoes, plenty of cash and away you go"
495,5.0,"The coex mall stretches over a great expanse, stretching from The Intercontinental Hotel Paribas, to the 7 Luck Casino over 1km away.  As Seoul is party to extreme temperatures in Summer and Winter, this mall makes shopping, dining and getting to and fro as easy as possible.  For the first-timer, it may take an entire day to get used to the mall-but there are a lot of fun distractions to keep one from panicking in confusion.  There are also lockers from place to place in the mall which served me greatly the last time I went over. I don't know how I managed before lockers changed my shopping world forever."
496,4.0,"The Coex Mall speaks for itself. It is hugh and trendy- a shopper's Mecca. Among endless cafes, fashions, Department Stores, souvenirs, we found Jackie Chan's Dim Sum and a multiplex (The Megabox). And if you are considering to stay at one of the hotels (Park Hyatt, the Coex Intercontinental or the Grand Intercontinental) in this area, you will certainly find the City Terminal in the mall particularly handy. (The travel from Incheon International Airport to the Daechi Dong area is a very long distance.) For international travel through Incheon, allow at least three hours before flight time. (We were told by the hotel we need 4 hours. But the Korean Airline desk set the record straight and told us 3 hours is sufficient) Our flight was 10:30am in the morning. We arrived at the city terminal a little after 7 am. Checked in our luggage and got onto an an airport limousine(bus) right away, around 7:15. (For flight to Jeju through Gimpo, allow 2 hours) We found our Korean airport experience much less hectic than the North American equivalent."
497,5.0,"This is one large underground mall. It has everything you can possibly think of.. tons of restaurants, clothings, toy, book stores, and lots of coffee shops. It has T.G.I. Fridays, On the Border, Starbucks located inside."
498,4.0,"I went here to go the English language bookstore. If you have some spare time, the kimchi museum is a unique experience you won't find anywhere else in the world. If you go to Bongeunsa, it is worth briefly checking out this mall but not worth a special trip otherwise."
499,4.0,"The first couple times I went here I got completely lost and half vowed to never come back. Eventually I somewhat learned my way around. The giant iPhone maps help a lot, but sometimes I had to find a couple of them before I found my destination. Coex pretty much has everything you could ever look for, if you can find it. The movie theater inside is top notch!"
500,4.0,"The mall is impressive as far as shopping goes but then again there is shopping to be had EVERYWHERE in Seoul. The reason for my review is for the sushi at Todai. Great price and wonderful atmosphere. I've been traveling for while now and the sushi here is good quality for the price. I paid 30,000 won for all you can eat sushi which I think is reasonable. I have gone back to a few of their locations and I still like this location the best."
501,4.0,"Coex Mall is a little bit far from the city but it's definitely worth visit if you're a shopaholic. Like every other shopping mall, they also offered many entertainments for the visitors. They have all kinds of amusement inside the mall, from Indoor Aquarium, Indoor Garden (with various kinds of plants), Megabox theatre, Kids zone, karaoke and there's even a museum of kimchi! Not to be missed, it's Casino on the top level! It's a nice place for family hangout or if you like to spend a day in one place."
502,5.0,"If you live in a building connected to this mall, you could literally lives days without every leaving this huge complex. It's a huge mall with tons of restaurants, shops, and opportunities to get lost. The Samsung metro station is at one end and the Coex Intercontinental hotel is at the other end, plus the convention center as well. We enjoyed traipsing around this monster mall."
