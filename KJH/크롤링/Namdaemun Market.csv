273,5,"If you want to experience shopping at a traditional market in Seoul, this is a good one to see. It?셲 smaller and more manageable than nearby Dongdaemun market. I enjoyed walking through and getting the experience even though we didn?셳 buy much."
274,3,I am not one for markets. I came as it is apparently one of the largest and that it certainly was! We got lost. Local junk. There was nothing good apart from the odd boutique jewellery store. Nice to see the locals and absorb the atmosphere. Some parts were not that clean.
275,4,"Fun place to walk around and shop. Dedicated sections for clothing, baby goods, luggage, camera shops etc. I came for the kalguksu bibimbap alley and the grill fish alley. There are red angels ( tourist ambassadors in red uniform) standing at major intersections for questions. Great place to get a flavor of local culture."
276,3,"It's not so easy to track if it's first time. Little unmanagement, crowded and messy. However for experience Korean market is okay than really shopping."
277,3,Went here mainly to buy dried food such as the famous freeze dried strawberries and cuttlefish from Seoul Sanghwae. The market also sells various trinkets such as jewelries. Myeongdong is also a walk away.
278,5,"I could spend days browsing through Seoul's famous Namdaemun Market, because they have everything, and it's Korean style. All from souvenirs, through food, snacks and beverages to wholesale. And all the way through, you meet smiling people. If you don't have days to spend there, at least give it a try of a few hours, it's worth it. And one more thing; It's clean, nice and clean and nice. Don't miss it if you're in Seoul."
279,4,"My husband, son and I visited Seoul, South Korea for the very first time the end of January. Our Hotel, the Tmark Grand Hotel, was within walking distance of the Namdaemun Market and we visited it numerous times over the course of the week we were there.  I'm not a big shopper but I am a foodie and we ate in a couple of restaurants in the Market as well as sampling some of the street foods and I also purchased some Honey Butter Almonds, which are a very popular foodie souvenir to buy when in South Korea, at a lower price than if you go to an actual shop that specializes in them (of which there are MANY). :)  I love Night Markets. Coming from Canada I can't get enough of them when I visit Asia. Everything looks so FOREIGN! LOL! I saw all manner of fresh fruits for sale, spices, clothing, foodie treats, and much, much more.  The Market, which is the largest traditional Market in South Korea, has over 10,000 vendors, retailers and wholesalers. It is a dense maze of stalls and restaurants. One night while we were looking for a spot to get some dinner we came out of a back alley to be faced with a stunning Old City Gate right across the street which turned out to be Sungnyemun Gate, South Korea's #1 National Treasure. You honestly never know what is going to be around the next corner.  Merchants have been selling items near this location since 1414 AD!!!!! There is an information booth with people in it that do speak some English which is super helpful. They also have free maps so you can orient yourself. We went to the Information booth one evening for a restaurant recommendation and were pleased.  Just go wander.....it's uber fun!"
280,5,"Dear colleague travelers, here I leave you a review for the one and only market worthy of a visit in Seoul: The Namdaemun Market. Filled with excitement, strange and curious things, lots of interesting street food, raw food ingredients, music, clothing, souvenirs and its booming with people.  Still the rule of South Koreans is not to understand a word of English; but in this market like everywhere in South Korea; be ready for price rise as soon as they see you coming and being a non-Korean. Speculation is in the air.  Most of the things you'll be able to buy when it comes to clothing and souvenirs; is cheap worthless Chinese crap. But concentrate on the raw products and on the street food. At least prices are exposed and the prices are the same for foreigners and locals alike.  Just walk around (watch your pockets) as there are some suspicious persons in the area. Don't spend much (you will be tempted) but remember most of the souvenirs globally are cheap Chinese products that you'll end up throwing away.  In Korea you need to concentrate on walking a lot as there is plenty to walk, take fresh air, don't spend on garbage, have some curious food and the points of Interest are to be museums, palaces and all related to this activities. (museums and monuments, places, etc are really cheap). This is my advise.  We recommend this market as the ONLY one worth. The rest is just copy and paste."
281,5,"Must visit. Nice and busy market. Get yourself a signature stamp, facial masks, sock (and more socks) and stuff. Good food on the go as well plus a beer to keep your sanity. Sops inside and outside. Highly recommended."
282,3,"Mostly shops and a lot are the same. Lots of clothes, socks, bags, etc. Some streetfood. Try the dumplings!"
283,3,This is a huge market running over several streets. keep your bearings as you can easily get confused and lost. It is a good place to look for clothing and diverse goods at low price. Can get some good souvenirs as well. A very interesting place to visit. It is walking distance to Namsan Park. So both can be visited in a day trip.
284,5,"Can't find that one thing or forgot something -- this is the market for everything and more. You will love it -- and never, never bored (but does get busy after 10 a.m.)."
285,4,"A very busy market. It is interesting to keep you entertained. Only problem is communication barrier. Koreanshardly speak English, becomes a problem especially when you are in the restaurants eating."
286,2,"It was supposed to be a ""treat day"" for the kids to go to the toys street but to our horror, there were NO TOYS!  Needless to say, the kids were utterly disappointed & so were the adults."
287,5,"A local market where you can find many shops selling souvenirs, snacks and fashion. It includes many streets with different zones. Enjoy strolling along the streets."
288,3,"If you live in a country where there is no big markets stalls like this, then this may be an interesting place to visit."
289,2,"This is a market mainly focused in optical products, knock off clothes and not very authentic souveniers that are made in China. Go to Gwangjang Market if you are looking for some street foods, Go to Myeongdong if you are planning to do some shopping. Worth a visit if you are trying to get yourself a new pair of glasses, but you will probably be overcharged if you are a foreigner. Bring one of your Korean friends. Since it is very close to Myeongdong maybe a 30 min quick stop would not harm you if you do not expect too much."
290,4,"The place was packed with stalls selling clothes, food, souvenirs. They are lot cheaper than at Myeongdong. The food is much on the street food options. Try the egg bread, or the hotteok."
291,3,"Nothing special about this particular market, probably a bit more exciting at night but none of the stores are particularly unique or interesting. I am sure you can find more lively markets out there."
292,3,We came here thinking it would be more like the Myeongdong shopping area. It?셲 not terrible but just wasn?셳 what we expected. It is a great place to buy souvenirs for cheap.
293,4,Interesting attraction with a great food alley. Hidden gem in the heart of Seoul. I recommend a hearty bowl of Kalguksu and a nice stroll around the market.
294,5,Great place to shop. Tons of people from different countries. On the spot money exchange. Yummy street food. Shopping off the street and can readily bargain.
295,5,"Cruising to the evening in the night market if Namdaemun Market, where they are lots of cheap soveniors yo buy. There are many souvenirs from winter clothings, socks, magnets, light snacks and even cafes around the corners of this night market. There are many locals handmade crafts and design made in here by the korean itself. Lovely stroll in the evening. ?븝툘?븝툘?븝툘"
296,5,"Went to numerous street markets in Seoul and the best bargain I would say is Namdaemun market. Do take exit 5 once exit mrt so you will see the food before the shopping. Manage to find a shop selling 14 pairs of socks for 10,000 won. After shopping around Namdaemun market you can walk over to lotte mart Seoul station which is about 10-15 mins walk away."
297,4,"Love this place cause it got everything. I went in December and it was cold but not snowing but still my body couldnt stand the cold. I got a jacket here which costed me less than i would have bought it somewhere else, which i wore throughout my stay. They ve got pans, kitchenwares, knickers, jewelleries, etc. You got to go there to see for yourself. For me it was worth the visit."
298,5,"Visited the traditional market which sell traditional Korean cooked food, fresh food and other items like electrical appliances and clothes. Tried the dumplings, fried tempura, corn dog and others. Food was fresh and delicious. Definitely worth a visit."
299,5,"It is somewhat like dongdaemun. But nearer to Myeongdong, right beside Shinsegae department store. We encountered snow whil shopping there. Price of stuff are relatively similar to Myeongdong but higher than dongdaemun."
300,4,"It is at Hoehyeon Station and not far from Myeongdong. Rows and rows of alleys between shops where traders peddle all kinds of goods. If you are on a budget and ran out of ideas what to buy to bring home, a visit to this place will soon get you planning what you shall buy for whom.  Do go in the morning as traders have this belief that securing the first sale early bringeth luck for the rest of the day (urban legend?) but have the fun of bargaining for your loot. All for a steal.  And since you are already there do visit the underground mall as well."
301,4,This market is ideally located and can easily be found . It is long stretch of market stalls that would fit everyone's liking. Prices here are affordable compared to other markets i've been to in Seoul. Vendors may not speak fluent English but will still accommodate every buyers inquiries.
302,2,"I spent a week in Seoul about 3 years ago and would stop by this market to grab some freshly deep fried red bean buns etc. for my morning walk up namsan park.  Because I fly through ICN a number to times a year, when I have a long enough layover, would head into the city for a quick hike and revisit of the market.  Have been quite disappointed the last 3 visits this year. The same vendors that were friendly and smiling are no longer. And have become short and abrupt.  The first time, I chalked it up to an off day. We all have those. But 3 times within 6 months, don't think it is a coincidence anymore.  I don't know if it is because they have become tired of tourists or something else. But it leaves a bad impression and I won't go back.  The young people who walk around as ambassadors of the market are still very friendly and helpful."
303,4,"Bought my breakfast there almost every morning. There is this particular shop that sells Pau. Hot and nice. There was another Ahjumma who sells Ham, Cheese and Egg Toast. Very good for a chilly winter morning."
304,5,"this is one of your must-dos if you visit Seoul, the people, the food and the collies. easy to get to. That?셲 where you experience the Korean life."
305,4,"Namdaemun Market is the largest traditional market in Korea with shops selling various goods. All products are sold at affordable prices. Namdaemun Market sells a variety of clothes, glasses, kitchenware, toys, mountain gear, fishing equipment, stationery, fine arts, accessories, hats, carpets, flowers, ginseng, and imported goods."
306,5,"If you want to experience street food, go on weekends, day time. The small roads are closed.. That is my findings while in Seoul in early Nov-19. (Landed on Saturday night.. Went to this lively marketplace on Sunday morning. When returning on Wednesday, the road is opened to vehicles and no more street stalls.)  I started my trip at Namdaemun subway exit 5. Right at the exit is a fruits and vegetable store that selling items at wholesale price.. At least the strawberries I bought there is way cheaper (& sweet!!) than in Myeongdong and all other areas. (Imagine 6000krw at Namdaemun vs 12000-20000krw for a pack of 32 strawberries selling elsewhere.)  Walk down the streets and get the street food first.. Solely window shop down the street.. You will discovered the pricing of same things is getting cheaper when going deeper into the market.."
307,5,"This is my fourth year?셲 pilgrimage to Namdaemun market?셲 multitude of food alleys: before starting my ritual of bargain hunting, I made sure to follow the aroma of grilled fish. And oh, what a marvel that was! The egg souffl챕 was amazingly light, and on any given day, there must be 4 different fish on offer. No menu, no fuss, just find an empty stool and enjoy your lunch, for less than 10$! Heaven on earth!"
308,4,Always enjoyed walking and bustling with the crowds for good food and shopping. Namdaemun market just grows into me with her charm of eclectic mix of goods and awesome food choices.
309,4,This market was recommended by my hotel staff after I complained about the somehow expensive prices at the malls and it didn?셳 disappoint. Not only is it a good shopping experience but it is a good place to interact with the locals and offers a wide range of street food. I totally enjoyed the experience
310,2,"Most people have said on the internet that you can shop here until the wee hours of the morning, but be warned that vendors DO pack up at 8 or 9PM and then it becomes a dead zone, I have tried going 4 times at night and this is the result, it is best to go during the day."
311,4,1. 40 minute wait in mid- afternoon for savory vegetable hotteok located just across from Courtyard by Marriot NDM was worth it! Greasy but oh so tasty. Likened to Chinese Scallion pancake. Nice.  2. Shop for prescription glasses or sunnies in the many spectacle shops at the market. Prices and styles are very competitive. We settled on Polaris Spectacles shop where we found the English- speaking Mr Kim to be very patient and attentive. A pair of Varilux progressive lens which would have cost me SGD 350 back home cost just half the price here. And it took just 4 working days to get them ready for me.
312,3,Came here at night and couldn?셳 find the food alley. I walked around everywhere and couldn?셳 find it. Finally got internet and found it was north of the market
313,5,"Here you can find most of Seoul famous street foods and shopping area for clothing, hats...etc, but most stores usually close earlier by 10pm."
314,4,"This place is worth looking at. Especially the jewelry building with hundreds of small shops. Anyways, not really a place where I would go shopping"
315,5,"I spent a couple of hours in Namdaemun Market. There are numerous small shops there. You can find many souvenirs and odds and ends there. Don't forget to bargain. The vendors won't be offended by this. Remember, this is not a food street. It is a place for buying/selling stuff. The prices are cheaper than those in more formal stores."
316,5,"Don?셳 be scared to explore every nook and cranny of this fascinating market. From 10am to 5am you will find many treasures, depending on the time.  Also, if you want to practice your haggling skills then this is a good place to start. (Don?셳 haggle food though; however, don?셳 me nervous about asking for a big portion.)  I?셶e come here with family or friends, but keep the little ones close because there is a lot of hustle/bustle taking place.  Since it is a traditional style market, try some food you?셶e never eaten before. I discovered cow lungs mixed with spicy red sauce and rice is delicious.  This is a great place to buy cheap clothes for kids. Also, the silky grandma pants are wild looking and comfortable. I got 2 pair for 5$ once.  I wouldn?셳 take kids here at night, but Seoul is very safe. There might be a lot of drunks singing at the moon, and if you fancy getting drunk and shopping, then by all means shop here.  If visiting Korea, then this is wayyyyyyy more of a ?쐊orean??experience as opposed to doing something mundane like visiting Seoul Tower.  Like I said??explore. Go in buildings. Walk around. Haggle if you can. Don?셳 get ripped off. Try something exotic to eat. Howl at the moon with traditional Korean alcohol."
317,4,"I came here during December 2018 to buy Christmas souvenirs for my nephews!! They have cute clothes----Babies to adults!! Got a couple of nice shirts for my dad, and family. It's a nice market to experience shopping and sightseeing in Korea :)!!!"
318,5,A must visit for the food. My partner tells me the shopping was overrated and expensive. May aswell ship in the stores for better quality.
319,4,Interesting market place for varieties of Korean food and souvenirs and other stuffs too but mainly food and souvenirs.
320,5,Hair-tail alley is a must visit it was so good I went three times on a seven day trip. Currency exchange rates are better here compared to myeongdong.
321,3,"A very typical Seoul market with endless roads that can be confusing, many shops selling the same things. Worth going for the interesting cultural experiences and sensory stimulation."
322,4,"Night market style arrangement but open day and night. Can find anything is this market, but u need to bargain."
323,3,"We came here for glasses to be made, good price and ready in 30 mins. Lots of tourist gifs, clothes, household. Notice some of the prices are expensive, compared to underground shopping places."
324,5,"Went for a stroll trough seoul and I've stumbled on namdaemun market.  It has great variety of food, clothing and other appearal. It's also. Cheaprr too! A plus thing is that they don't keep yelling at people(props)."
325,4,"Food, clothing, knock offs and everything else you could think of. Fun to walk around and even with a lot of people, you'll feel safe."
326,4,"I was referred to Food Alley(a small narrow lane opposite to Bldg C) by a Korean tourist representative and happened a lady who speaks well English mentioned they have English menu. Why not? I gave it a try and chose Bibimbap and turned out to be so far the best I had ever eaten. The seaweed was marinated well which made the rice smells good fragrance. If you like spicy, do tell them as I could not take too spicy food. Price wise, standard. Service, good and place is clean and tidy. Go for it, if you could."
327,4,"Very colourful place to go, lot of people, food, souvenirs, and what ever you want to find and not that expensive"
328,4,"Huge market with loads of clothes, food, souvenieres, etc. We spent about an hour walking around window shopping and eventually bought a few things as well. Loads of knockoff brands sold, make sure to bargain! Lots of small side streets that I think are really worth it to go down, there are some really tiny restaurants with some amazing local Korean food. A lot of the shops closed down at around 6pm, but a lot of the street food vendors set up around 5 and that was definitely very worth it! A lot of amazing food for very reasonable prices, and a great taste of Korean culture along the way.  Metro line 4 takes you straight to the market."
329,5,"I was a teacher in Korea for 6 years, some of the time I lived in Seoul, other times in the provinces. Always I would make time for Namdaemun Market. If I needed something I knew I could go there and find it. The best items on my list were outdoor gear. The market had many vendors for hiking and climbing boots and shoes, crampons, clothing hats, walking sticks, energy bars, you name it, they have it. Plus you get to people watch. There was one elderly Korean lady who set up her old sewing machine in the alley way and was making her living in public. I was in so much awe of all that was around me, Korea really is a magical place in many ways."
330,4,"This street is one of the busiest streets in Seoul. You get to see a lot of clothes shops, fruit shop, candy shops and traditional sweet shops. It's worth visiting the place if you don't have other things to do."
331,3,"Looks mostly like any market anywhere in the world, with some exaptions. Nice to walk through, but dont spend more then an hour tops"
332,3,"nothing much to buy here all selling the same thing, only one cart selling cheap souvenirs vs all the stores I checked out. The seller can even give me a discount since I buy more souvenirs. Bought 1 dress after I asked for a discount and fixed price for other stores for 1 cardigan and 1 shirt."
333,5,"If you are looking for any bargains in Seoul then I recommend going to Namdaemun Market near the centre of Seoul. A busy bristling market full of people, clothing, food, accessories and lots more. This market fills every corner of the 6-8 streets that holds it within a small square area of Seoul and is a great place to explore and buy presents for back home. Namdaemun market appears to be mostly a clothing market and accessories like bags, sunglasses and watches but it also has plenty of food and drink vendors stationed around the various corners of the market. You can find some cheap bargains in here including dress trousers, football tops, bags and much more. And some of the imitations would fool anyone on the more luxurious branded items. It was so good I went back three times during my two week break in Seoul and I still think I only explored half the market so I guess I will just have to go back next time."
334,5,This area is well known and a must see. Especially if you like a bargain or street food. There are several adjoining streets and an interesting place to go at night. It's also not too far to walk for Myoungdong night market.
335,5,"I learned that this was the place to come for eyewear.It is full of shops selling frames from around the world.I found a pair of Grriffi frames and Anne&Valentin frames-both at a very nice savings. You can give the shop your glasses and they can make the prescription for you ,but I opted to have that done back home where it could be adjusted if there was a problem. Not all shops are created equal-shop around before you decide. I visited all of the big Seoul street markets,but enjoyed this one for all the local residents using it. Lots of souvenirs were here from China just like the other markets, but there were huge multifloor buildings filled with everything imaginable and with widely varied quality. I loved poking around and watching local buyers and sellers visit. A great place to lose yourself in the hustle and bustle-IF you have time."
336,3,It is a large market and had everything one might want to purchase and some that you would not want to buy. It had some atmosphere but it was still just a market. The streets serving food had more character and interest.
337,5,"Everything you could want from Korea is available-at this market. Hundreds of outside vendors selling food, clothes, trinkets and so much more. If you are in Seoul you must go to this market."
338,4,"We walked this market a few times while we were in Seoul. Many vendors and stores offering overwhelmingly beauty supplies, sneakers and food etc. Name it, you can find it there. We spent about an hour here the first time and kept going back. We purchased a few souvenirs, teas and makeup mask at very reasonable price."
339,4,"?럨?⑨툘?덌툘Namdaemun Market Namdaemun Market is in the vicinity of Myeongdong Market. A conventional shopping hub where one could buy from an assortment of goods ranging from food, sports wear, bags, clothing, textiles,ginseng, accessories, cosmetics, kitchenware.Who knows one could strike a bargain or get a great discount. A must visit."
340,4,"I'm always drawn to local farmer's markets and this was that, although so much more. There are fish vendors, steamed pork bun vendors (which were amazing!), clothing stalls (LOTS of clothing stalls), drugstores, spice vendors, handbags, cooking utensil shops, confectionaries, art supplies... It seems like every turn you take, you'll find something a little unexpected.  For instance, the art supply store: it was about the size of my bathroom at home, yet it was packed with all sorts of things - canvases, paints, paintbrushes, at VERY reasonable prices. In fact, good quality oil paints at cheaper prices than I can get in the states. Ditto for spices. And K-beauty stores.  I watched a woman make udon noodles from scratch and a man filet some fish. It was a fun experience that could be as short as a half hour or a half day trip.  I'm definitely glad that we went, and I would assuredly go back. It's a great place to find authentic gifts to bring home, but a terrific place to people watch!"
341,5,"If you are looking for tourist gifts then I would definitely start here before venturing out to the more popular street markets as I found some great bargains here!  Of course they do sell similar items but it's also a place where the locals mingle with all the tourist so it's a great place to people watch, definitely worth trying out some of the food stores too, I got some fried doughnuts and they were yummy!"
342,5,"Most shops are clothing, but this place is pretty big with several blocks of streets and alleys. Along with basements and multi floors of stores after stores.  From my group, lots of ladies bought many skin care product, souvenirs and food here."
343,4,"It is a traditional Market place with shops and street vendors . We bought some socks , sun hats and dried fruit. I also saw some knock off clothing and bags along with fur coats . There were also food vendors and we got to try some traditional korean soup. Overall an interesting place To see for those who want to experience a more local vibe"
344,5,"There is much to see here. At first I was not interested as I had been to another market and I didn't really know why I would want to explore more stalls and why I would need numerous, inexpensive trinkets. Still, I kept walking and the next thing you know I was very interested in the market. It's interesting to see coffee shops, run by a single person, tucked between perhaps a little jewelry stand and a store selling hats. You will see all types of products, from leather jackets to $3 earrings. You will find all types of fried foods, being prepared right before your eyes. We'll find a complete alleyway of nothing but restaurants. Other food kiosks are scattered about. On one side of the market is fronted by quite a few camera shops and I even bought a lens. Well, I guess that says I was having a pretty good time."
345,5,"Visited this place on our ten day summer holiday last week. Lively place with hundreds of shops and stalls selling all types of Korean made shoes, bags, scarves and a lot of other goods. Lots of fake item shops, make sure you bargain well and hard. Great food stalls as well."
346,5,"Loved the market. One can easily spend half a day window shopping or shopping and trying out some street food. Pity that we got to spend only a couple of hours there since we were specifically looking for luggage. Would have loved to browse through the shops much longer and walk around. Definitely go there while visiting Seoul. Price wise, I did not see any great deals, some shops are open to bargaining and some are not. Nothing was really marked down. Nevertheless a great place to browse and look at things that you do not need :)"
347,4,"I spent half a day to visit this market and I didn't finish my tour! It's absolutely huge, you'd get lost inside it. I was a little bit disappointed about the clothing and jewellery, not good quality and they all look like each others. Much better is the food! Actually I didn't try anything, but the smell was so delicious that you can bet it was something really traditional and tipical of that place. All inside the market there are many of these street food places, and you have the opportunity to try different dishes for a low price. For sure it is very contaminated by tourism, and it has probably lost most of its characteristic atmosphere. Anyway I enjoyed my visit there, I only wished to have had more time to explore it better!"
348,3,"The Namdaemun market starts just from the Namdaemun Gate (Sungnyemun Gate). It's a pretty big market with food, clothings, accessories, beauty products, electronic stuff, fake goods and many others, but forget the South-East Asia market. Prices aren't so cheap as people may think. I expected more."
349,5,"Love taking souvenirs home and sharing it with family and friends but on a tight budget? Namdaemun Market got your back! They have tons of different souvenirs to choose from such as kitchenwares, clothings for adults and kids, stationeries, accessories, to beauty products, and more. They also have food alleys that's definitely budget-friendly.  Another thing that I love here is that the tourist information people are everywhere! They have english-speaking personnel and other language experts that you can talk to and ask about directions and all. They're easy to find since they're wearing red uniforms and hold placards.  VERY TOURIST-FRIENDLY!"
350,5,So there is the day time shopping and night time shopping. If your looking for kids clothes you can come after 10pm to 5am. On #6 you can find many kids clothing stores. The key to getting a discount is buy more than one piece. I think the minimum is 3 and up. So we bought on this trip maybe 9 of the same kids sleep sack different colors and sizes to give to friends and it was much cheaper. For example a kids hat I bought was 15000won each but if I buy more than 3 it?셲 9000won. If I buy three I save 3000won and get 3 hats! Anyway this is the deal and for accessories you need to buy by the dozens and many styles. The last time I came I bought hairpins for my kids and friends. They come out to 50cents each very cheap. There is usually less people at night and this is when the wholesale customers come so just be aware to get deals you must buy more. Also make sure you bring cash. This also helps since most money exchanges close before 10pm. Good luck shopping.
351,3,"A good place to walk around as it is a big market which sells a variety of things from food to clothes to Kitchen utensil. However, encountered some unpleasant experience with some store owners. Who only focused their attention to Japanese tourist. Where I was in the midst of considering to make a purchase and a group of Japanese came along, the store owners just left me abruptly and attended to the Japanese."
352,4,"If you're looking for a cheap souvenirs or even snacks like in LOTTE mart, you can go here. You also can find some traditional snacks in the evening."
353,3,"The market is big and bustling. It is more about lower quality, cheaper and fake goods. We thought it might have had more hand crafted things but it didn't."
354,4,"The market covers several blocks of the city and just about anything can be bought here. Not really a tourist market, much more a real market. There are several good cheap eating places tucked away in the alleys. Many of the establishments have pictures to help choose your food. Good location for cheap eats."
355,5,There are two main shopping districts in Seoul for buying bulk items. Namdaemun and Dondaemun. You'll find a lot of what you're looking for in Namdaemun plus you'll find plenty of places to feast your palate and stop for a drink after shopping. A must see place while you're in Seoul. It's a short walk from the subway where you can go anywhere in Seoul.
356,3,It was really difficult to buy anything as there were too many shops. Most of the shops sell very similar things from clothing to souvenirs. There malls are tightly packed with stalls selling yet again similar things. Also the fashion was more suitable for the older generation. Food was a let down here. The interesting was the guards from Deoksugung patrol here daily.
357,5,"We visited Seoul again after few yrs back in 2017,2016 & 2012 via Singapore.We went to Namdaemun market few times whenever we were in seoul and there are many things here & have many choices to choose especially a shopholic like me ^^ This year our second homestay located near to Namdaemun gate 5 and we love walking just across it."
358,4,Namdaemun Market is a good place for local food and other traditional custom. It opens up to midnight.
359,5,"In contrast to many other places in the world, Seoul is not super touristy and Namdaemun even less so. There's mainly Korean locals who shop and dine in the area so you won't really be got with tourist traps or tourist prices. Be careful eating at the street stalls though, you don't know if they're sanitising that stuff properly. Lots of good souvenir shops too."
360,5,Enjoyed so much more than Insadong market because it was more authentic and less typical retail. Many products were the same. Allow at least 2 hours. Enjoy!
361,2,"Big market selling lots of souvenirs and cheap wares. Plenty of food stalls to try, but avoid the alley restaurants displaying their wax dishes and calling you in - we tried one and the dishes that arrived looked nothing like what was advertised, tasteless and we got only half the dumplings displayed for the same price - was then told the front displays were ?쐓amples??only. Then they pretended they didn?셳 know what to do with a credit card - asking for cash - when there?셲 their machine right there and finally put it through on the card to give us a proper receipt. Really dodgy."
362,3,"It is extremely huge and you?셪l probably get lost, it goes underground overground and the streets go on and on. Anything you can imagine you will find here. So big that I actually lost interest and left with only some watermelon.....maybe it?셲 some twisted Korean reverse psychology so make women shop less."
363,5,A market where you can find very good street food and nice shops. I like this place and enjoyed the street food
364,4,"We bought some magnet souvenir and keychain here. We ask the information and they were very friendly. We loves the souvenirs. Overall, Namdaemun Market is very good place to buy souvenir"
365,5,"I love this Energetic Market so much. There is lot of popular street food shop in local. Mandu , Kal-guksu, Hotteok...Fresh fruit Juice."
366,3,"Huge market south of Sungnyemum Gate. Visited on Sunday afternoon. Appeared less vibrant than Myeongdong (I had visited Saturday afternoon), and didn't have the food stalls. But prices were cheaper (unless I didn't bargain hard enough at Myeongdong). Worth an hour (or two if you are wanting to shop), good for souvenirs."
367,5,"A leisurely 15 mins walk from Myeongdong. Love the street food available. A great place for sight, smell and taste. Ate traditional korean bbq. It was fantastic and very reasonably priced. There's a small lane lined with small restos selling mackerel, beef soup etc. So yummy. There are stores selling cheap souvenirs to clothes, eyeglasses, contact lens. You name it they got it here."
368,5,Great place to shop for souvenirs. Go in the morning because it?셲 quite happening. Buy souvenirs here as it is quite cheap compare to other places.
369,4,This open-air market is the perfect place to go and try a large variety of Korean food. Very cheap and good. Definitely suggested.
370,4,"Quaint it ain't. Namdaemun Market is huge. Not just a rabbit warren of streets selling everything you can imagine: from kitchenware to clothing, from bags to braised pig knuckles, there are numerous warehouse-sized buildings to explore. To get a good deal, you need to bargain."
371,5,The area is buzzing with vendors and above and underground shops to sell you almost everything under the sun. You can walk and pick your spots totry a taste of Seoul or you can walk through the alley corridors to slide into ine of the many restaurants to eat like a local. It's the Korean version of the early days of Canal street in NYC.
372,4,"It?셲 a Traditional market with food and souvenirs, Kids clothing, matured ladies clothing, lots lots products, very cheap price if compare the underground street. Walking distance from Mengdong. Suggest to go at day time, shops will close at night."
373,3,"It's a market . . . many stores sell the same merchandise all at the same prices . . . lots of junk, very little treasures . . . food stalls which are mostly less than appetizing (and some with very questionnable hygenic practices) . . . and less appealing on a hot,humid, odiferous day than on a cooler, less smelly day. So, you either love it or you hate it -- it's an individual preference."
374,2,"We visited in the afternoon and there were lots and lots of stores that sell similar stuff. They sell clothes, shoes, souvenirs, kpop merchandise... the prices were more or less the same but some were cheaper. We did not spend much time there though since the place did not look appealing (it may have looked more alive at night) and it is easy to get lost. If you want to shop for souvenir, this could be a good place to go."
375,3,"Much talked about this site thus the need to venture it. Indeed there are lots of shops/stores to venture but it was not my forte as I dont really like crowded area and confusing lanes. Maybe, I am not prepared for it. However we did some shopping here and as soon as we are done, we took off. No doubts there are loads of stuff selling here. Some might enjoy it thou."
376,3,"This is the oldest and largest traditional market in Korea. It is spread out over many blocks with about 10,000 vendors. Nowhere else in Korea can you find such an array of items. It was an interesting place to wander through even without buying anything. And it's named for the Namdaemun South Gate nearby which I visited also while in this area."
377,4,This is a huge market selling different items. There are some maps saying which street sells what but we just took a wonder around. We saw a lot of shops selling shoes or hats or phone accessories. There was also a home-wear section. Some shops selling Korean souvenirs. We visited a second time as I really wanted to try a corn dog and there was a whole row of venders I think it was near gate 4 (if from here you walk down into the centre of the market). We also got some Korean sweets and found a postcard!
378,3,"The amount of shops were lesser and less touristy as compared to Myeongdong. There were, I think, more food stalls though."
379,1,"Majority of the clothings sold are very dated. Good for shopping of children clothings but not adult. Some vendors there are pretty unfriendly too. Pricing of souveniers are either the same or higher than what you can find at express bus terminal shopping area. I would suggest not to waste your time to make a trip here.  Yes there are many stalls there but if you are looking to buy clothings, 95% of the shops are selling extremely dated clothings, after taking out food & beverage stalls, only 2% are worth a look, but pricing is higher than what you can get elsewhere. Truely a total waste of time."
380,1,"Maybe it was because I visited Nandaemun on a weekday evening, maybe it?셲 because I?셝 just come from Taiwan where the night markets are world-renowned, but this is a very unremarkable market selling a limited selection of food.  Besides fixed shops offering baked goods and pigs??feet, there are stalls selling skewers which average about 3,000-5,000 won. Each stall sells almost exactly the same selection at almost the same price. There are alleyways off the main streets in which you can find sit-down restaurants selling the usual Korean fare - bulgogi, noodles, cuttlefish etc. I went into one of these and had spiced cold noodles with boiled egg.  From the stalls I had rather some chewy octopus skewers and average chicken skewers, some bland fried shrimp and a nondescript sugared dumpling. I wouldn?셳 repeat the experience.  Overall I was really disappointed. Having lived in China I came expecting a high standard of street food but this was nothing to write home about. I have seen much better markets in very rural areas of other parts of Asia, so I was surprised at just how uninspiring this one was given that Seoul is such a large and international city. In fact I would venture to say it?셲 the worst market I?셶e ever been to.  As for the products for sale, they are primarily Supreme imitation hoodies and other paraphernalia, and trinket shops. I can?셳 say I find that kind of thing interesting but if you do you might enjoy that side of the market."
381,3,There were some good bits to visiting Namdaemun markets . We didn?셳 see the deep fried baby crab anywhere else and the dumplings were excellent. The busy hot and narrow food alleys with kitchens along the walkways were a sight to see if not too enticing to eat at. Nevertheless I thought the Gwangjang Market had much better food quality and variety and the Myeongdong street stalls had much more atmosphere in the evening so if you were time pressed I?셝 do these first.
382,4,"Namdaemun Market is quite a large place, selling a variety of products - clothing, bags, food, etc. If you want something cheap, best come here instead of going to the department stores. Also lots of places to sit down and have a coffee or snack."
383,4,Plenty of shops selling so much stuff- even if you don't wish to buy this is an interesting market to visit. Lots of areas to get lost in. Lots of atmosphere.
384,1,"Nothing much to see or buy. Within 10 minutes, we left the place for good. Will recommend if you are interested for photo taking."
385,4,This busy market is a great place to get souvenirs and really anything you could possibly need. Grad something on a stick to eat and wander round.
386,4,We happened on Namdaemun market by chance on our first night in Seoul and wandered up and down the stalls which varied from the mundane (cheap tea-shirts and nick-nacks) to the fascinating - preserved ginseng roots and pigs trotters. There were several street food stalls including one stall with delicious dumplings and soft pork rolls.  Small lanes run off to the left and right lined with small shops and stalls. Whilst there were a few tourists like ourselves we were outnumbered by locals. Well worth exploring.
387,1,"Went during lunch hour under the hot mid day sun. The market in general is covered but the stores are quite cramped and it gets pretty heated. Was looking for the counter seats eating area like in Gwangjang Market, but walked a few rounds and still cannot find it. Ended up in some mediocre Korea ?쐒estaurant??that sells a range of Korea food. So they say jack of all trade master of none, the food was not fantastic and they expect one main dish per pax. If you are there, please walk into a small alley which u see ppl queueing for grilled fish and steam egg. May be a better choice for authentic Korea food."
388,3,OK Market full of tat. If you like fake supreme stuff you will be in heaven. Some OK street food but otherwise I'd skip this bit of town!
389,3,Very crowded market with lots of different shops selling the exact same stuff as all the other markets. They seem to have a high demand on phone cases in this country. We had very nice heotteok here.
390,3,I love Namdaemun more than Myeongdong because the goods and the foods here are cheaper. But the market is a traditional one so it's a little bit dirty and crowded.
391,2,"I didn?셳 particularly care for this market. Too much cheap stuff in jam packed spaces and hoards of people. People rummaging through clothes scattered across tables, cheap knock off handbags, tee-shirts, etc. I did enjoy delicious bibimbap at a small restaurant nestled just beyond the cinnamon donut street food vendor. A lovely owner who stirred my food for me and was so very kind. I preferred Myeongdong neat LOTTE and Dongdaemun neat JW Marriott and Doota."
392,4,Typical Asian market. Very nice to visit and get an impression of how people live eat and dress. Every time we are in Seoul we visit this place.
393,3,"If you are in Seoul, you definitely need to check out their markets. It is organized chaos and something to behold. All manner of food stuffs (although seaweed seems to predominate) and ready to eat street food vendors. One of my guides indicated there were some 27,000 retailers here. All small shops. The quality seemed good for the most part. It was fun to get a little container of fried crabs and just walk around munching and seeing the various wares. Beware though, there are very few garbage cans so be prepared to carry your empty containers for a while. All the items are quite cheap. The crabs were 5000 won (about $5 USD) for a big tub. It is just a short walk from the main Seoul Railway station along the elevated walkway, the 7107. There are other shops selling clothes, tools, and souvenirs as well."
394,4,"This market is worth a visit. Many curious things are traded here. For example there is s shop that sells gift packaging materials, so if you are looking for a special wrapping for a gift this is the place."
395,4,"Remember this is not the Galleria Mall here...we are talking huge quantities of cheap mass produced items. They have. clothing, furs , suitcases, food (massive food market starts at 4:00). Look for the candy vendor that makes candy from cornstarch. They insert a filling that tastes like a snickers! No kidding. Easy to take home and they last for weeks. Good for GF folks"
396,1,"Went there for street food but it is almost inexistant and scattered all around the huge market. If you are after something similar to markets in Thailand, this is not the place"
397,4,Enjoyed the street food. Deep fried baby crabs especially. The shopping is not very interesting but still worth looking at. A good place to find very local food
398,5,This is a great market to visit although very very busy! It was very interesting walking around looking at all the stuff people sell!
399,3,Saw a myriad of stalls and large numbers of shoppers but was disappointed by what seemed to be quite average items being sold
400,4,"It a great market, just be prepared to do a little digging. Found good deals on shirts, scarves, every day use kinds of items."
401,5,I visited Namdaemun. I could feel the traditional market of Seoul. The grilled fish restaurant inside Namdaemun was delicious. I recommend it. It was nice to walk to Myeongdong after eating at Namdaemun restaurant.
402,5,..its a good place to buy some item for gift..its cheap and all items is there..you just need to keep looking for it..
403,5,"It seems as though every time I find myself in Seoul, I find myself at Namdaemun Market. I love this place especially if you know what to look for. They offer cheap prescription sunglasses to affordable brassware. The weekdays are the best time to go here as the weekends are crazy packed and it's difficult to even walk in the streets. If you haven't been, check it out!"
404,3,Food and clothing stalls in the middle of the road and stores along the street. Place for cheap clothes and local food.
405,5,This Market was very close to my hotel so I went down several times in the evening Lots of street food on offer it is very vibrant with lots of different people sending different types of things from pot scrubbers to jeans to three piece suites and more. Very interesting experience well worth a look
406,3,"I believe this place is cheaper than Myeongdong, but not as interesting. You can go here if you want to shop at a really low price. We were able to buy a lot from here, and most of our souvenirs came from this market."
407,4,"Namdaemun Market is a must when visiting Seoul. Nighttime visit is a lot better than during the day. My wife always finds several things to buy every time we visit. Remember where the restrooms are, sometimes they are hard to find. Tourist information teams can be found throughout the market. They will be dressed in all red. They have free maps of Seoul and the market in English. No need to dress up for the visit.  My favorite are steamed pigs feet. The vendor will a small bag containing onions, sometimes garlic and one or two other items that compliment the feet. I always get a couple to take back to the hotel room.  Recommend wearing of tennis shoes because you will definitely be doing some walking."
408,5,This is one of the largest traditional outdoor market in the middle of Seoul. Varieties of foods and goods are endless here. Love tasting some quick snacks from street vendors location in central part of the market alley. It still retains its charms from bygone era of shopping from old time.
409,4,Lots of fun with so many different shops! Don?셳 miss out on the socks! So many choices! A fun environment!
410,4,"We visited Namdaemun Market right as the sun went down, so I'm not sure if some of the stores were getting ready to close for the night, but we still found some awesome deals. My friend bought a cute winter jacket for $5!!! We bought some toddler hanboks for W35000, which is pretty reasonable."
411,4,"We stayed in Tmark Grand Hotel just opposite this market and my wife went crazy shopping in here for clothes for our daughter, so many stalls to choose from, so many new and stylish clothes for our kid. Bring lots of cash or stick to a budget, try getting some discount and it works sometimes.  In the evenings there are many food stalls selling all kinds of snacks so you will never go hungry."
412,4,"Do go to the information booth to get a map of the place first so that you can plan which section to explore. Good for buying cheap clothes, currency exchange with attractive rates. We came here to buy children's clothing."
413,3,"We came here on a Friday night and it wasn?셳 anywhere near as hustling and bustling as we expected. It was around 8pm and most stalls were winding down. A few tourists were around, but we didn?셳 get the buzz a lot of the other reviews mention. We found a quiet restaurant for dinner and then left. During the day I can see this being an incredible atmosphere!"
414,3,Namdaemun is a shopping area which is overwhelming. While it is conveniently located and shops are inside airconditioned buildings seeing so many stalls one after the after from one floor to the other can be overwhelming. But the goods sold are definitely cheaper and you could probably find some good bargains.
415,5,"You're looking for souvenirs, local items made in Korea, Namdaemun market is the place. I bought some of their local snacks like dried fruits and vegetables, sweet potato chips, and many other kinds of flavour. We got free bag of mix veggies and fruits chips for each item I bought, great deal. Namdaemun is one station away from Myeongdong."
416,5,"This place full of cheap stuff, such as souvenirs, clothes, etc. And sometimes, the seller will give you some bonus. There's a lot of street food too."
417,5,I'm not sure if anyone knows how many stalls there are in Namdaemun Market! The street food stalls are interesting and it's worth trying a few to get into the spirit of things. They have a fried pancake which is then stuffed with either meat or vegetables that is absolutely delicious. The steamed dumplings with either pork or kimchi stuffing are also very good!
418,2,"Not necessary to visit this place. So many better places to go. This market is filled with cheap t-shirt and hair accessories, knock off bags, etc. Nothing that you would go to Seoul for. If you do feel you need to go, be sure to go down some of the smaller alleys, as those are better than the main streets. Some good food stalls in the small alleys at least:)."
419,1,"Place to shop for souvineers and snacks. Variety street food, fishcake, lobster tail, waffle, ice cream, and more."
420,4,Prices don't get any lower in Nandaemun market. Traditionally they cater for wholesale but some do entertain tourist buyers.  Be prepared to use sign language as many don't speak English and jostle a bit as the alley can be quite narrow and cramp.
421,3,"I visited this place to find a special vintage camera, there're lots of stores for that purpose near the Sungnyemun Gate. The market itself is rather messy, lots of chinese products of all kind. No good souvenirs or fashion clothes. There's a tourist info desk ot far from subway gate 5."
422,5,We stayed 9 days in Seoul next to the Seoul station..we asked to the hostel reception for the best price exchange..He said Namdaemun and Myeongdong back streets have better rate from banks.. That was right especially in the midpoint there were two places that have very good rate. After Seoul we went to Pusan and Jeju.. we couldn't find good rate..if you start from Korea journey from Seoul..I advice you can make all exchange in Namdaemun market.. and in that time you can eat very delicious Korean local food on the street..
423,3,"Shoes, apparel, souvenirs, kitchen utensils, kids clothing, handicrafts, bags, street food - you can get all of these in this huge market. There are shops in the building right next to the market as well. We went in early afternoon so the crowd is not too bad."
424,4,It is a good experience here to shop at the open air market for a variety of items such as food and clothings. There are also plenty of wholesale shops here but they cater only to businesses and does not sell to individuals. You will need time to go into the alleys to explore the variety of shops that sells household items and many other types of things. Namdaemun market is said to be the largest in Korea.
425,4,"Visited on a Sunday afternoon. The place was full of activity, with shops selling everything Korean one can ask for ??souvenirs, clothes, all varieties of Ginseng and other medicines....and of course an endless choice of food. A great place for bargain hunters and those who enjoy browsing. One must have plenty of time to look around ??there is so much to see and discover. The food stalls in particular are a great attraction ??one can have a full meal just sampling the items being made at the live counters. It is on the City Tour Bus Route ??just hop off soon after you start at Koreana Hotel and spend as much time as you want, before hopping back on the Bus and carrying on.....! A great experience indeed!!"
426,5,Visited Namdaemum for the first time. Love the varieties of merchandise here. The market is open early in the morning. Do go early before the big crowds descend. Try out your bargaining skills. :) You can get pretty good stuff ranging from scarves to Korean traditional tableware. I came back here couple more times. Don't forget to check out the little eateries in the small alleys for the authentic local cuisine.
427,5,"There are a lot of bargain souvenirs, street foods, pricey and cheap goods. 1 station from myeongdong station.many choices on different items"
428,5,"Like any market ... a great place to find soooo many great treasures! A lot of people in the Market and so many ways to travel within the market but there are info booths to help you out and also people in red jackets in the ?쁦ntersection??areas to help you.  And don?셳 for get to ask for a deal! A great place to buy souvenirs! Oh, and you have to try the homemade dumpling booth ... there are a few but see the pictures for the one we went to! Absolutely delicious!!"
429,5,"This open air market was across the street from our hotel and is mostly hidden through many lane ways , it?셲 amazing that from street side you wouldn?셳 know how much market is there until you start walking through it. Lots of good vendors but this market mostly clothes. It?셲 a must on your list. On a side note the currency exchange in this market have the best exchange rates all very good and clean."
430,5,Anything you can buy asking interpretation staffs who walk around the market for visitors'/foreigners' help if you need their kind service as free of charge.
431,3,"This market is positively rated in most guide books. From my point of view it?셲 a bit overrated. It?셲 almost the same in such markets in Asia-colourful, noisy, overcrowded."
432,5,"What a fun outdoor market. You can find anything in the market and it?셲 a lot of fun looking and haggling. It is easy access via subway, lots of great places to eat, and lots of cheap stuff to see and buy."
433,4,"Of the two markets I went to, Namdaemun and Gwangjang, I prefer Gwangjang. Namdaemun doesn?셳 have near as many food stands as Gwangjang. For me, most of what was for sale at Namdaemun is junk. I didn?셳 buy anything. Still, Namdaemun is worth the time. Wouldn?셳 go again, but would recommend to friends."
434,5,"not a bad market to visit, basically sell lots of clothing and the street food here are cheap. clothes are quite cheap too."
435,5,Weekday night is not too crowded and going here before getting dark is also a good idea to avoid the crowd.  Try the local street foods of Namdaemun.
436,5,Woke up in the early hours looking for some noodle in the area. Came across a small food area in Namdaemun Market that offers hand cut noodles. So yumm! Approx. 5000 won.
437,5,"Namdaemun is very famous for its cheap and affordable price if you want to do shopping. They sell clothes,shoes,socks and many more!"
438,2,This was supposed to be an old established night market of Seoul. However we found it quite deserted with few stalls.  Our disappointment was saved some what by nice pork knuckle sold by a small Chinese restaurant located within the market.
439,5,"Ginseng everywhere :) If you want to see a real authentic market, do not hesitate to visit it. Recommended..."
440,4,"Although I didn't buy anything there, it's a great experience to browse the different items for sale. As I was walking around, I found the dumpling people are talking about in Tripadvisor. I bought all types of dumpling to try.....yummy! If you eat there, you can help yourself with the danmuji ( yellow pickled radish) which are placed beside the stall. There are no chairs and you have to stand and eat. Along the lanes are small restaurants. If you are adventurous, you can go in and try the local food. If you stay in Myeongdong shopping area, you can walk to Namdaemun market - less than 900 meters."
441,4,A perfect place to buy souvenirs with bargain-able price. So many items to look at. Huge area and requires lots of walking. Must try to famous food stalls.
442,5,"Some stores are closed on Sunday. But most of them are open everyday, crowd starts to fill the market around 9am. Mostly dry goods and preserved food. There are small restaurants nearby. Your ??0,000 can buy a lot of souvenirs."
443,4,This area is huge and basically you can find everything there. I did not buy anything so I am not aware of prices. Area have also many nice camera shops.
444,3,"This is the place to find cheap souvenirs. We had a good tour around the market, we spent some time here browsing for nice souvenirs. They sell so much stuffs here. Clothing/ accessories/ footwear/ snacks/ food. We did not try any of the food there, though some of them had Halal signs. Some sellers speak Bahasa Malaysia. Just a few Malay words. Interesting! We went there just to find souvenirs. There are other places you all should check out if you want to buy fashionable clothes, shoes, cosmetic products."
445,5,This is the opposite for the fancy and expensive shopping streets. Lots of little stalls selling all sorts of stuff in cheap prices. Couple of interesting food vendors as well. Nice to look around :)
446,3,"We went for the night market, the only thing that attracted me is the local food restaurant street. Recommended: Pepper beef soup with rice and bimbibab Skip: Kimchi Fried Rice"
447,4,"Whole sale market. Touristy but very traditional place at the same time. There would be everything you need. You can also get some cool stuff for souvenir. Calguksu street represent this place. Calguksu bibimbob nangmeonw combo is signiture meue of this place. It costs only 6,000 or 7,000 won."
448,4,Cool market. Not the modern market but the old school market selling both new and old school stuff. Lots of stuff to see and experience. Overall a nice experience.
449,4,start early. look for lengdang building for brooches and all the ladies bling bling accessories. the street are narrows and crowded with shops and shoppers. best place to change foreign currency.
450,5,"A must visit place in Seoul, this market is the largest one in Seoul covering over 16 acres. There is very thing here, be it cloths, toys, stationary or street food and a best place to buy Souvenirs for your near and dear ones. There are lot of shops specializing in selling refurbished cameras and accessories. If you are buying anything be ready to use your bargaining skills. And if you do not want to do any shopping, it is still worth visiting here."
451,5,I am totally amazed by the changes through the years at Namdaemun..  In fact Namdaemun is never my top option to visit. But I have changed my mind since after experiencing the changes which took place.  Neater and easier to walk around with less grouchy vendors. More signs for tourists to locate different zones and with helpful guides in uniform around who speak several languages to assist with maps given.  Various yummy authentic food available at reasonable prices such as Hairtail Alley which is a must try.  Lovely easy connection to Seoullo7017 the pedestrians walkway from Namdaemun after all the feasting..easy going walk.
452,5,"Wholesale market for costume jewelry,clothing,perserved item and a lot more to mentioned.I even bought raw ginseng from here ,from an old couple who runs a small shop.Should try their abalone porridge and red bean porridge.Thumbs up ,yummy !"
453,4,"Lively market. We arrived around 7pm so most clothing shops were already closed. However at the street level all the little food stalls were bursting with life so we tried some of the food, some of which were rather interesting! We felt safe eating these ?쁲treet food??because they fried/warmed them up on the spot. The shopkeepers were friendly too. A great experience."
454,4,We went there a few times.it is very big and sells everything from food to fashion you can eat good cheap korean food there aswell as good street food can get very busy in the evening.you have to go if in seoul
455,5,This is the best place to go for souvenirs and street food because it is much cheaper and less crowded than Myeongdong or other famous shopping places in Seoul.
456,5,"Come here if you want cheap gifts, t-shirts, fridge magnets, key chains etc. If you are into accessories, head to e-Lengdang 2nd floor. This is a heaven for accessories."
457,2,"Be careful where you eat, my daughter got a bad stomach here. She ate the round patty with vegetables inside, Try and eat the street food that is made freshly in front of you,"
458,4,"Went there by bus number 3 from Namsan Seoul Tower, 6 stops only. Quite a big market, as went during winter month of December, too cold to stay too long. Have good kimchi buns, fish cakes soups & food Valley with seatings to eat in comfort. Many shops to see, can bargain a little if buy more. Not all welcome bargains."
459,4,"When you start walking into the market, for those who have been to Bangkok Chatuchak market, there is a sense of deja vu. This place similarly has different section for clothing, accessories, etc. You must look for their food alley which serve very local food. Compared to BKK, this market is slightly more spacious so one won't feel as claustrophobic."
460,4,We happened across this market while searching for a restaurant. It was a fascinating place to wander.
461,4,Thoroughly enjoyed strolling around this area and we bought some lovely souvenirs at the handicraft center. From crane bird boxes to Korea fridge magnets and chopstick-holders ?? Did not yet find a great place to eat local food but we?셪l try again tomorrow!
462,3,"Actually a typical local market that people here to look for bargain. Sometime you may not get a good bargain either as you must know how to bargain. Lots of clothing, shoes, food and food stuff. Nothing special but is enjoyable to walk around and enjoy the atmosphere. One of the stall that selling the hot steam bun is really good.. Long queue and prepare to wait for your food."
463,2,"Okay market, but same thing over and over again. Gave 2 stars for the food only, great Korean BBQ. Okay experience just to tick the box, but you get the gist of it after 20 minutes."
464,4,An interesting Korean mixed goods market to visit when in Seoul. You can bargain for affordable products from clothings to food items from Korea
465,2,"I read about good review of Namdaemun Market. But for me, as a shopper for good value stuff, this place is not great. Yes, plenty of shops and many many choices. But it's mainly for reseller. I stopped by one of the store and wanted to find out the price. The sales lady asked me if I'm a seller. I gave up and walked away."
466,5,"I knew I wanted to spend the day at one of the famous markets, they are so fun, loud, interesting, and you get a true sense of the culture from meeting the street vendors and trying all the exotic dishes. This market in particular I was told is the biggest one in all of Seoul, my friends and I spent nearly five hours there and feel like I barely covered a small section."
467,5,"There is nothing you can not find in the market. It extends for blocks on end. Street vendor food is great, especially the hoteok and there is lots to buy and bargaining is part of the fun."
468,4,"We arrived in the early evening on a Monday, and noted that some of the shops on the peripheral were selling produce that locals were buying. Walking along the vibrant streets in Namdaemun Market, you will see many shops selling souvenirs, clothing, etc, as well as street stalls selling local food. Worth a visit to see a street market in Seoul."
469,2,"i wanted a place to buy traditional foodstuff like ginseng, mushrooms and fruit. This was a mistake. I should have gone to the one at Jegidong when I last visited 3 years ago. This one, though nearer the city, sold mainly expensive fake toys and clothes. It is massive, with many 'gates' but each selling similar products. A total waste of time."
470,5,"Good to come in the day as you can catch many good deals in the many stores here. Fresh food sold in the Market, stationary stores , great gift giving ideas all in this one place- a whole sale centre where you can buy almost anything including costume jewellery, wedding gifts, korean handicraft souvenirs etc"
471,4,"We enjoyed the assorted food stalls - interest and different Korean fare. The shops offer a variety of clothing, luggage and other items, some, like tools, for locals."
472,5,"Cheaper souvenir and more choices. From keychain, mirror, pen, shirts and many more. Compare to Myeongdong Market. Can find halal Kebab within walking distance from the Namdaemun train."
473,3,Namdaemun is a market that mostly sells clothing. There are a few other types of shops sprinkled in but the majority are clothes and shoes. The quality is similar to what you can get in the underground subway shopping but prices are higher than what you will see at the subway shops.
474,5,The place where one could buy cheaper souvenirs than elsewhere. Grab anything that is cheap here as I regret for not buying much from here
475,4,"Went on a Sunday late morning.  Seems like some of the alleys are not opened. An alley called the accessories alley is totally quiet and empty, the pushcarts are all covered up and the shops are not opened. However the Main Street is busy, with all the food stalls selling the different local food items. Many of the pushcarts are selling the same items but some are more patronised than others. Even if you dun know how to order/eat, just observe the locals and follow what they do.  Besides food, there are many stalls selling imitation branded stuff. Some are such bad fakes- the words Tommy Hilfiger printed on a hoodie with another Brand?셲 logo. Reminds me of night markets in Bangkok.  Have yet to explore the Kulguksu lane and the fish lane, but both looked busy."
476,4,We were able to walk here from our Hotel Manu using the Seoullo 7017 elevated walkway and an elevator down to street level. We found it to be much cleaner that the public markets in the Philippines and also a wide variety of street food and small eateries. We had some hot Korean Soup in one of them which was OK although we had to just look at pictures and point since nobody spoke English there. There was some fruit at an outlet on the sidewalk which I couldn't identify... it might have been figs.. which we probably should have tried but didn't. We actually wanted to spend more time in this place but it started raining so we didn't want to get any more wet and hadn't brought out umbrella.
477,5,"I love this market, lots of good food. Things to buy for soveniers and nicely located near the metro Hyeon, exit 4 and 5. You won't go wrong in coming here. There are guides to help you around if you are lost. Love it so much that I even came for a last walk on my day of flying off before I checked out from my guesthouse. Wonderful place"
478,4,"I went in the morning when the shops and stalls were just opening, and it wasn't too busy. I'd recommend in the late afternoon and at night when its crowded and hustle bustle. It would add to the atmosphere and excitement of the huge market.  The market seemed to be orderly, with womens clothing grouped together, electronics all in one area, children's items in one area, etc. So there is some order to the market!  I recommend just wandering down the allies and exploring without a plan. Please keep in mind there is no English to be found, so bring your guide map! There were 2 young girls wearing red information vests who spoke wonderful English to your destination and provide you maps.  Definitely go to this market! There's a great feeling here and you can pick up anything and everything you could possibly think of and need."
479,5,"Great place if you are a foodie and love to explore local food at its simplest. Plenty of choices to eat tasty and inexpensive specialties for which the best recommendation is the fact that locals really do eat here. And once you filled up your belly, you can dive into shopping of food and other goods souvenirs, as Namdeaemun is not only a food place."
480,5,"If you enjoy a bazaar atmosphere, this is for you. Indoors and passageways full of men, women and children wear, custom jewelery, items for the house, you name it, is here. Even several Christmas shops. There are wholesale only shops among the offerings but they will tell you if you happen to walk in one. Plenty of food stalls to maintain the energy."
481,5,"Everything you could possibly need is available in this incredible market. From army clothing to jewellery, fish to bedding. Get a map from one of the friendly guides and just follow your nose and experience the authentic Korean market. Granted there?셲 a lot of tat on the stalls but there is in any market. I would recommend seeing the fish part of the market, and the food stalls. At the end of our walkabout, we saw this food cart with a queue. As everyone in the queue was Korean, we thought it must be good so lined up not knowing what exactly they were queuing for. 15 minutes later we bought two deep fired veggie pancakes for 2,000 KRW - about 짙1.40. We walked up to Sungnyemun Gate and tucked into them. They were absolutely fabulous."
482,5,"I stayed near this traditional market during a recent visit to Seoul and visited three times. Huge, the place has eight numbered gates; more than 10,000 stores in buildings and stalls; merchandise ranging from flowers to military equipment; and food carts. It seems to be the liveliest in the morning, when I encountered thick crowds, and rather quiet in the late afternoon. The market obviously attracts shoppers, based on the transactions I saw taking place, but also visitors with cameras, soaking up the atmosphere and enjoying photo ops.  I went for the atmosphere but ended up returning to seek out inexpensive souvenirs, such as bookmarks and fans. Though I looked at other items, including clothing and accessories, nothing appealed. Much better quality can be found in nearby department stores but with higher prices.  My favorite part of the market proved to be the ubiquitous food carts, where vendors prepare all kinds of yummy-looking fare. I finally got in a long line waiting for a hotteok (deep-fried veggie pancake) by Gate 2. It took about 20 minutes before I could put my order in and I received the hotteok almost immediately. The cost was 1,000 KRW, about $1 U.S. I stood on the street, eating this tasty delight and savoring every bite.  It is easy to get lost in this complex of pedestrian streets and buildings, so I suggest getting a map from the market's information kiosk before starting to explore. Enter from Gate 2 at Namdaemun-ro or Gate 5 at Toegye-ro. The kiosk stands on the street that connects the two gates, near the souvenir shops.  Namdaemun Market is easily accessed by subway (lines 1, 2, 4) and many bus lines. It takes about 15 minutes to walk there from Seoul Station."
483,5,"Whatever, wherever, whichever people says about buying souvenir from Korea, for me, this is THE PLACE. Without a single iota of doubt, this is the place to be to look for Korean souvenirs ranging from fridge magnets, unique Korean Cutleries, and so on. But the best time to visit is after lunch time since lots of shops will be fully operational by then. So prepare the money and shops (souvenirs)."
484,4,"Are you hungry? There's a variety of things to eat!  Do you prefer to shop? Don't worry, Namdaemun's got you covered!  Do you just want to see new and exciting things? Well, what are you waiting for - go to Namdaemun!  Even if you don't want to spend money, I would highly recommend still going to experience the atmosphere of a traditional market. There are people everywhere, shop owners are shouting about the items they are selling to those who might be interested, and deliverymen are swerving in and out of the crowds.  Also, side note - please go eat the Hotteok here! IT IS DIVINE AND AMAZING! Especially when the weather is cold!"
485,5,"This review will focus on Kalguksu Alley or ?쐍oodle alley??that is inside the Namdaemun Market. It is difficult to find. I had a local Korean friend with me and we had to ask about 4 people. It was kind of fun to find because it is literally hidden. I would recommend using a maps app and not giving up. Once you do find it take a seat at any of the many soup stalls. You?셪l be knocking elbows with fellow eaters. There?셲 no way around this due to the very small space and high demand of the food served. The alley is only about 20 yards long. Most stalls serve soup noodles and bibimbap. When you?셱e finished, pay and leave. There will probably be people literally standing behind you waiting their turn. This is an ?쐎nly in Seoul??type of experience. Please try it."
486,5,"This market is packed with many locals and tourists. There is an assortment of food and drink (both restaurants and street food), fresh produce, garments and clothes and many others.  There is a portion with many stores selling all sorts of cheap accessories and raw materials to make accessories and embelishments."
487,4,"we went there on our last day and regreted, wish we had more time going around the maze of shops, and locals do their shopping here too, prices are about 5% cheaper compare to Myeongdong or underground mall. good for nice bags and some local eats. be sure to come with a suitcase and an empty stomack, and ya, there will be a few ""tour guides"" in red ready to help. they have various language available."
488,5,"There are many kinds of food . There is a shop selling hot steaming buns ! Their original ones taste fantastic, prefer the original to kimchi one! First time trying out the pig's leg there.... not bad but tasted better ones. A place to buy bath cloth !"
489,5,"It's a nice local market, perfect for shopping souvenirs to take home :) Try the dumplings and the ginger tea, those are so good!"
490,5,"Huge market with various things. All the stores are in their own building. They sell hair accessories, jewellery, kids clothing, ladies clothing and many more. Took the metro and stop at seoul station, walked the seoullo walkaway towards Namdaemun market"
491,4,"This place is for an older crowd... comparing to Myeongdong street market. Authentic, has its own charm of traditional Korean market. Buy anything under the sun. Lots to eat. KPop mania items. Pots, pans, great bargains."
492,5,One if our favourite spots to visited day or night. Crazy variety of street food at great value. Also interesting to shop for souvenirs and do some bargaining.
493,4,"The market is clean and easy to Find. IT has good places for clothes, accessories, eye glasses and souvenirs. Some local Food stuff are also available. Prices are cheap and a lot OF locals are here for marketing OF their Daily needs. We were only a handful OF Tourist present in The morning. A good place to feel The local pulse OF The City."
494,4,We visited this market area one morning while waiting for Shinsegae department store to open.  All the clothes and ?쐉ewelry??looked like cheap low quality stuff.  The food stalls were ok. There was one food stall that sold fish cake that was very popular.
495,5,"Very busy during the weekends. Do not forget to visit the Community Lounge, which serves free cookies, tea, and other snacks - not to mention the"
496,4,"the best thing you can buy in this market is pearl, the prices are reasonable it is amazing place to visit in Seoul"
497,4,"The entire market is enormous, especially if you enter the many malls within the area itself. I entered two of such malls and wanted to purchase some jewelry but was told that it?셲 not for sale to individuals, only business(wholesale). This was a little disappointing. However, the street food is delicious, the hotteok in particular is a must try! It?셲 not necessary to walk the whole market as majority of the stuff on sale is repeated throughout, and may be a little too old-fashioned for some tourist."
498,4,"not a bad place to find a $5 US dollar deal for a coat or sweater on October. If you find your size, you?셱e lucky. Korea has many oversize style sweater. I found a gem among the stalls.  It?셲 really fun to browse and look. Prices on clothes are way better than Myeongdong. There are more locals here and the pigs foot restaurant we entered is just for local. A taxi driver recommended this location for the seafood Korean soup soondubu. I couldn?셳 find it bec there are many unique local treats. If I had more time I will check out all restaurants/fruit stands  Airconditioned stalls accepts credit cards, cash only for the $5-10 deals."
499,4,"I almost got lost in this market ?삃. It is a must. Please note that if you are lost or looking for specific information on the area, touristic officers are located almost at every 2 streets or in the most populous area of the market."
500,4,"Very central and walking distance from the metro. There are hundreds of shops and stalls. The usual are available, shoes, clothes ,souvenirs etc, etc. There are dozens of food stalls. Worth the visit for budget shopping."
501,5,"There is this old lady (ajumma) who sells almonds and all the real o brownie cheaper than anyone else in seoul. I compared prices across lotte, gs25, 7-11 and all the other stores but hers were the cheapest and has the same expiry date as others.  She was very kind and she offered us to try the almonds of various flavours for free. I took a photo of her stall which I will share once I find it. Her shop is very small and narrow along the main street down Namdaemun market."
502,5,"If you're a fan of spicy braised fish soup or galchi jorim, this is the place for you! Hairtail Alley (found in Nandaemun Market) has clusters of small eateries selling this specialty---hairtail! I first learned of this this place from a YouTuber, and he made it look so good, I knew I had to try the dish when I visited. I'm so glad I did. The soup was to die for. I'm now a fan and trying to recreate a version of the dish at home."
503,4,Decent market. Not unlike it's sister markets around the world. Good selection of stuff. Best if visited to observe / experience local culture. Good 2-3 hour trip.
504,3,"Came here two days ago around 3 in the afternoon. Pretty big and busy. It?셲 very similar to a flee market. Lots of cheap looking clothes, some K-pop merchandises and street food. All the sellers were older people. Seems like if you stop to look, they expect you to buy. My sister got yelled at by one of them because she was looking at some food and was still deciding if she wanted it or not. Ended up not buying anything there. Still a good place to explore but prefer Myeongdong instead."
505,2,"You can easily get lost inside this market. It's huge and most of the shops look alike. It's a shopping area mainly for clothing and personal items. If you are just buying a few pieces of clothing, I guess you are better off shopping in other areas like Myendong(?) where you can see more variety of goods to buy."
506,3,Seriously i doesnt really like this place but since i m in korea why not. My kids like this place. Locals buying here cos i think it cheap but nothing after all. Place pack with ppl n cars
507,3,"This market was just opposite our hotel so we wandered over there on our first day, but have to say it was very underwhelming. Many of the goods looked to be straight out of China, not particularly good quality, the sort of things you can see in markets anywhere. There were plenty of street food stalls but nothing that really appealed. Most of the shops were packing up from 7pm and nothing much was open after 8pm, so visit during the day, or just head to Myeongdong instead."
508,5,"Asian market place in downtown Seoul. Hustle, bustle, sights, sounds, and smells. Certainly worth the visit."
509,4,We visited this market on our last day; my husband got a good quality souvenir t-shirt for just $4. There?셲 a lot of junk but it?셲 fun to look around and plenty of places to eat or grab a coffee. The information center near Gate 5? turned out to be two people standing around handing out maps which were very useful. There?셲 a good stationery store on the aptly named Stationery Street and a ton of camera stores all on one street.
510,5,I did buy some fruit and fried snacks from the stands. They were pretty tasty. I was able to buy several hats and scarves. I did find some good deals. The sellers were willing to bargain on some of the items. The prices are were okay overall. I did find purses cheaper at other markets.
511,5,Small alley down from gate 5 on left side as not easy to find famous spicy fish stew plenty of places to choose from all doing the stew fantastic food
512,4,"Looks like this is the best market in Seoul as it?셲 been going for a very long time. Street food here is great, lots of options and the donuts were unreal. The clothing is pretty terrible and there is a lot of supreme stuff that is clearly fake. Worth a visit tho for the atmosphere."
513,3,"The market is massive and stretches on. There are specific markets within the market for shoes or underwear etc. I was looking for some shoes but almost all were low quality synthetics. I did find one that had good quality leather shoes but he does have anything above US size 9.  Found most of the items were low quality and probably from China, although they insist that it is made in Korea.  It?셲 fun to walk around and maybe yo might find something you like. There is also a market for vintage clothing and flea market.  It will take a day to explore all. There are neighbourhoods you can also wonder off near the market where you can have a meal or see some of the older houses."
514,5,Found there is a lot to see and there is a nice selection of things a person can purchase. The street food was amazing!!! Glad I had the chance to visit!
515,4,"This is the place. We buy golf wear and other clothes (women's, men, children). Great selection at great negotiable prices! Everything from pants, shorts, jackets, suits, sport coats. Careful, you'll probably get asked about brand knock offs too so just ignore them."
516,3,"well, you wouldn?셳 mind the crowd; Endless markets to shop; Endless road to roam; Endless line to grab a bite of 짬 the 쨩 glassnoodle pancake(hotteok). Namdaemoon markets to have a sneak peak at KoreA?몭?몤"
517,3,I love only the street food here but I think that's enough for me. The tastes are okay. I dont buy anything there.
518,5,"Not much English is spoken here but you can easily point and they'll understand what you want. There are so many different stores, such as fresh food, dumplings (these are a must!), trinkets and there's this one little cart at one of the entrances where there is usually a massive line for either a sweet or savoury bun. I waited in line, and the vegetable noodle bun I bought was delicious on my empty stomach. You can really spend hours here and I'd highly recommend visiting."
519,5,"I am a market lover, so.... this was a must. And it is! A traditional Korean market, you will find everything here: clothes, souvenirs, food, it is a must with Dandaemun market and Insadong if you are in Seoul!"
520,5,Crazy market ??a must see when in Seoul - most impressive are are the food stalls - prices are OK not so cheap though- it requires energy to stay there for some time :)
521,4,"it was worth buying at namdaemun market though there is difficulty in communicating with the vendors, prices are reasonable."
522,5,Get Ho-Dduk in the front of Gate 2 entrance - honey filling and japchae filling. Then walk up the street (into the market shopping area) for about 200-300 yards and get dumplings and donuts.
523,4,"My family and I went here to get souvenirs for the rest of the family.  The best things (I guess!) that I got here were the brooches. There is a building with one floor full of little shops with the staffs making all sorts of jewelleries and ornaments. Brooches,bangles, bracelets, rings, you name it, are all here. Then change to another level and you will see they sell vintage decorative stuff for your homes, tshirts and baby clothes.  Maybe you can bargain (I didn't cuz I never really know how to lol) and get yourself a good price for the things you buy. Take your time as namdaemun market is a big area."
524,4,"This is fully a market place, so be prepared to be bustled around by people walking fast and haggling! I didn?셳 buy anything because I was just looking, but there are loads of little souvenirs things you could get and some great food too!"
525,5,"I really like this place. People are so friendly and there are many street shops where you can buy souvenirs and eat. There is a mandu place inside the market that is really good and really cheap. You have to go there. They give you 5 Mandu for 3000 won and you will have side ?⑤Т吏? for free and water. There are many tourists so, sometimes make sure to ask for a discount in some stores."
526,4,"Huge numbers of shops, selling everything from t-shirts, souvenirs, kitchen tools etc. Nice place to stroll around for 1-2 hours. Price is reasonable."
527,4,We were able to get 3 statement shirts for krw11000 & purse for 6000. You can huggle w/ prices in this market than Meongdong or Domdaemum & Hongik
528,4,"So much to see, buy, eat,. These markets are huge with something differnt to see around the clock. Food cooked fresh and served quickly by friendly staff. Lots of food choices whether it is something quick and easy by a street vendor or a sit down meal in one of the food alleyways."
529,4,"Most of the market is covered, which is nice on a rainy day. It is very cramped but worth a visit. The souvenirs were cheaper than at other places in Seoul"
530,5,"You can find anything from fresh flowers, homeware, clothes and even toilet curtains! Bought 10 pairs of socks for $7.00 here. Very cheap and handy."
531,4,If you a looking for lots of choices for inexpensive items this is a good place to good. Good place for souvenirs. Also found a currency exchange booth with very good rates.
532,3,"It is a place I think everyone should visit, but this thing is over hyped big time. Yes there are lots of vendors, most of them selling the same ?쐓tuff.??I went because I wanted to try some street food, but I didn?셳.. I understand Kimchi is the most famous dish in S Korean, but the smell of it makes me sick, which is weird because I love cabbage. Needless to say with the lack of shopping for anything worth buying and the constant smell of Kimchi, we didn?셳 make it long."
533,5,This is a great place to try the street food of Seoul. I also enjoyed walking around and viewing all the shops and the folks buying and selling.
534,3,"The place is near Courtyard by Marriott Hotel, you could visit it by walking ?슯 .... We had the chance to visit the market and bought some souvenir items on a cheaper price..."
535,5,Definitely worth a visit! One of the great market's we have seen. Try not to get lost as you stroll endless stalls. Something for everyone here.
536,5,actually so many kinds have korean traditional things and also really cool item very get to easy when you coming korea please try there
537,5,"Namdaemun Market is an open air market not to far from Myong Dong in Seoul, South Korea. You can find many things from clothes to cookware and everything in between. Put your sneakers on because you will be there all day looking for bargains. The market also has many food stalls to feed your hunger as well as the hunger to shop. Haggling is expected. Just go and experience it. Very few places like it on the planet."
538,5,"been to Namdaemum Market million times and never get tired. Although it is a top tourist place, you can still feel the local culture and get some unique stuff. However, the price there is not the cheapest one, so don't be fooled. in addition, you really need to walk around and compare the price. Don't just buy the stuff from the first stand you encounter. Most of the vendors here are selling the same things, so shop around, compare the price, and try to negotiate. Most importantly, have fun! Oh don't forget to stop by the Kalguksu Alley (right near the exit 5 of Hoehyeon Station) for a delicious noodle soup!!!"
539,5,"Compared to dongdaemun, namdaemun market feels much more local and authentic. I went in the late morning and both locals and tourists were bustling around doing their daily chores or shopping for souvenirs respectively. Check out the small alleys (stew alley, hairtail fish alley) for a claustrophobic but fun look at ajummas serving up their best food. Burdeng mall and Mama were great malls for childrens' clothes and accessories (way better than dongdaemun) but the streetside kiosks and stalls offer better prices (2000krw for 1 piece of clothing!!), that is if you manage to find pieces you like in the jumble of clothes."
540,5,Alot of shopping for clothes and bags and souvenirs. Highly recommended for people to go visit. Must go.
541,4,You can easy get lost in the streets of this market. Right next to Myeong-dong. Another place you can shop for a vast myriad of goods!
542,4,"On the last day of my trip, I went to Namdaemun Market to get some souvenirs for some people back in town. I wanted to get some beautiful brooches for my mom and most people know E-Lengdang in Namdaemun market is where you can get really beautiful brooches. I?셝 like to recommend one shop that sells brooches. The seller was very generous and had given us 3 free brooches after we bought some from her. She had told us that she uses real swarovski crystals for her brooches. The more expensive the brooches are, the more beautiful it is. Her shop is on the second floor and it is number 404. I have provided how the shop looks like and how beautiful the brooches that she sells! If you are looking to find beautiful brooches, you may visit this shop. Her brooches are the most beautiful I?셶e found in E-Lengdang. Have a great trip!"
543,4,"I stayed literally across the road from this market for 3 months when i was in Seoul which was great in terms of cheap shopping and grocery's and after a few weeks the ajuma's and ahjussi's were very nice always saying hello to me and giving me free food and snicks which was lovely, around 2/3pm the street food carts set up and it is sooooooo good and quite a lot cheaper than myeongdong! there is also a tourist centre just off the main strip of the market where i was able to get a new sim card after my other one ran out and for a discount, the agassi's were very helpful and set up the new sim card for me as well as getting me a cup of tea while i waited"
544,4,"The street food is really good, and priced cheap. You can buy any sort of clothing and gifts you want. Very low prices, but you get what you pay for. Try the food stalls at night."
545,3,"Mostly cheap made items such as clothing, toys and ornaments. We did not really enjoy it that much as we couldn't find the unique locally made items we were hoping for."
546,3,This market is nothing but most of China made cheap goods. Only very few local made items are sold. A sweet made of flour and honey is the speciality and should be tried. It's even more amazing to watch how this sweet is made.
547,5,Quite big and busy. A lot of interesting souvenir items to buy. But you can easily lost your way. Make sure you use Kakao Map for navigation.
548,3,"If you have time for only one place - Namdaemun or Myeongdong - I would highly recommend the latter.  Because Myeongdong is still very much bustling with activities past 8pm, whereas Namdaemun is a dead town by 8pm.  I would only presume that because Namdaemun is closer to the downtown area, therefore it might be more convenient to the people working in that area. As for tourists - head down to Myeongdong. You won't regret it."
549,4,This is the first place i visited during my recent visit to South Korea. The place was at walking distance from city hall where i was staying. The markets here closes early but good for buying Korean stuff and gifts.
550,4,"Easy to get to from Meyeondong, it is within walking distance from Lotte Departmental Stall too. Many different types of malls catering to different things,e.g. clothes, bags, etc. It will take hours to cover the area so you may want to spare some time here. Many food places too!"
551,4,"Traditional market for travelers that love to explore the local activities. Here you can find what you want to have such as street food/snacks, simple local food/bbq, clothes/bags/umbrella, souvenirs, home appliances, food material, kitchen equipment, electronic devices (camera), flower, accessories, fake jewelry, etc. You can try to bargain here with your best chance to get lower prices. The market is quite clean and spacious except the alleys that are located in the building. FYI: take a map from the information box to guide you."
552,5,"Great day and night, cheap fresh food, souvenirs and general cheap items for sale.  Safe friendly atmosphere with no pressure to purchase."
553,4,"Close to Myeongdong, this is a great place to pick up traditional artefacts and souvenirs at decent prices. The market opens late but is closed on some days - so check before you travel."
554,4,"This is the best place for souvenirs, we compared Myeongdong, Insadong and Namdaemun. Namdaemun is the cheapest among all these locations for souvenirs including t-shirts, key chains, magnets, masks, etc..."
555,4,"A big traditional market where you can get practically everything here..from children clothes, slippers, bags and souvenirs.. A lot of food carts and is good place to try all Korean snacks..Easy to access by train."
556,3,"This market was located opposite our hotel so it was very easy to access. The market seems to sell pretty much everything including clothes, kitchenware, fruit and vegetables, cooked food, hats, shoes, souvenirs etc. The market is actually quite large and there is a part called ""children's market"" but it had already closed by the time we were there. In front of the market along the main road are many shops selling camera gear, new and used lenses and camera bodies including all the famous brands so I think this was the main place for cameras in Seoul.  Despite being quite a large market there are far more interesting markets in Seoul such as the Dongdaemun Market for fashion and the Myeong Dong Street Market which was very lively and seemed much more popular."
557,3,"We went here for clothes shopping. Store owners do not allow you to try on the clothes they are selling, so having a tape measure with us helped us to decide whether an item was the right size. A lot of the stalls were pretty expensive though (we spent most of the time by the clothing buildings near Hoehyoen station, Exit 5). Just found less than a handful of stores with the prices we were looking for, and ended up with a couple purchases. Even in the summer, there were still stores by the road selling fur coats! Would have wanted to spend more time exploring, but the heat of the day got to us.  There's a lot of stores selling dried fruits, vegetables, even meat! I saw dried okra, dried peppers, dried strawberries, dried octopus (both spicy and not spicy)... the choices were endless!  There's a road with stores selling stationery, wrapping paper and gift bags that had pretty attractive options. We saw a couple of skincare stores as well in the area - not sure if the prices are good compared to Myeongdong. There are information booths, but the one we saw was closed during lunch break."
558,5,As the Korean say ?쐄rom needle to a cow??that all what you may find t the Namdaemun market It?셲 an old traditional market by Seoul old gate  Like flee market you get different things  Manal Oman
559,3,"Several short streets for shopping like casual shoes, T-shirts and bags. Not pricey but quality matches the price. Not many street food stalls. Popular food to try would be the stuffed donuts and HotDeok. Spent less than an hour here."
560,5,"This is very good market for street shopping. You can find everything clothes, toys, cosmetic and street food."
561,4,"Got there at 7:30 A.M. on a Saturday. Market not busy yet, which was GREAT. Lot's of fun looking around and asking and checking. Some of the markets are indoors so there was air-conditioning. I didn't buy much because the prices were generally not good deals like I've seen in China and Malaysia, but it was fun looking."
562,5,"We went to the design plaza first, highlight was my daughter got to play the piano outside! Then onto the markets... its 4 storeys of fabrics, ground floor lovely quilts, outside are zips and brocades, top 3 floors all material. Unless you are geographically minded, but it when you see it. I found a beaut green linen, decided to look around first and couldn't find the vendor again. Also, no places to sit or have a cold drink inside so be prepared. It was 33 degrees c when we went and even with air conditioning my kids were too hot and grumpy to go all around the building butI had no choice but to take them. Fabulous selection, patterns etc. Next time I'm finding a baby sitter"
563,5,A nice place to spend your money and to enjoy the local culture. We did buy our souvenir for our friends there. There is a nice lady selling cheap souvenir. It was nice to see made in korea! :0 Usually cheap souvenir are made in China! :)
564,5,"If you are looking for what to eat in Namdaemun Market, then i guess Hairtail Fish ( Stew or Fried ) would be be most popular choice. I have not seen this Korea food being offered in other places while i was visiting Seoul and Busan during my 9 day trip in June 2018, so i suppose that this might be the only place easiest to find for such a type of Korea specialty.  This fish dish is so popular that there was even 2 alley within the Namdaemum market dedicated to selling this dish. With many shops offering almost the same time, you would just need to look for one that would seem to be the most popular.  As there was no English signboards for most of the shops, we simply resorted to pointing at what the other tables were having and we were not disappointed.  My family of 3 person order 1 portion of Hairtail Fish and 1 portion of Fried Assorted Fish which came with some free side dishes such as pickles, beans, Eggs, and fried fish and rice. Iced water is always provided free at the table as well.  But do note that this fish does have quite abit of bones and the stew is mildly spicy. But overall, i think this is a perfect cuisine if you want to try something typical of this market.  Getting to this market might be tricky, but thankfully there are Local Guides Dressed in RED which are fluent in English and will be able to direct you to this alley."
565,3,"I would say this market is fairly traditional. A lot of gods, a lot of fake brands, narrow lanes and crowded.  If you want to buy clothes from the market, or well, from most places, be prepared! Take your measures beforehand and bring your tape-measure! There are no such thing as a dressing room or trying the clothes on ;).  The market felt big with numerous small isles both directions from what we called the ?쓒ain path?? As with most makets, it is a lot of ?쓘ame same??, meaning the same goods over and over.  All in all, it was an experience but to us, Dongdaemun market with Gwangjang market next to it was better."
566,4,I went on a food tour of Namdaemun Market and sampled several types of food and drinks at the various food stalls and restaurants. There were quite a number of food outlets in the market. There were stalls selling all sorts of items in the market. There were also shopping centres with multiple floors. There were lanes with stalls selling only specific items such as military clothing and stationery.  A free map of Namdaemun Market is available at the Tourist Information Center in the Market.
567,5,"Namdaemun market was good. They have lots of clothings,toys and accessories for children. Their price for kids and adults clothes are reasonable. Souvenirs at namdamun market is cheaper compared to other places. Basically of all the places like Myeongdong street, namdaemun is better in terms of cheaper price and more variety of items. We enjoyed our shopping at namdaemun market."
568,5,This market is a must for visitors - to see the various goods there are for sale ... from clothes to food .. but one must try to bargain for a good buy..
569,5,"A wholesale place to get your clothing, accessories and gifts. The shops inside the building or upper floor offer cheaper price. The dumpling in this market is the best. Really love the kimchi dumpling and pork dumpling. If you are there, you should try it !!!"
570,2,This area is older and smaller. Many small stores filled with stuff. The inside of the buildings are even worse. People have crammed their wares into a small area and sit like a flea market for you to come by. It?셲 neat to see but nothing seemed light to buy. At one point I used the bathroom which was a hole in the ground. Cool to walk through but lower quality options.
571,4,"At the beginning you assume this is just a large street market. Then you go into the buildings where there are three or four floors of market stalls and realise it is enormous. I found it a fascinating place to visit but there was nothing I wanted to buy. There are a lot of jewellery stalls inside the buildings, and quite a lot making jewellery as well as selling it."
572,1,"I read in many places about this ""icon"" and Seoul's must visit market but after visiting it I would warmly advice anyone to do yourself a favor and don't go there unless you got a spare half day with nothing else to do. Almost ALL stuff there is very very poor manufactured trash that looks coming from a third world country. It is a kind of stuff you can buy in any city in the world such as mainly women's garments but I must stress it's all garbage quality while prices are like buying from a regular shop. There is some Korean look stuff like hats and fans and again only for women, but does it make sense going to Namdaemun Market? ALL stuff is without prices so you must be able to speak Korean and willing to bargain just to buy trash! There are also some shops which sell international alcohol but again there are no prices so in these cases I don't even bother asking the price but walk away. It was a very disappointing experience and frankly speaking I don't get why people on forums talk so much about this ""iconic"" trash & trash place! Do yourself a favor and avoid this place!"
573,4,Namdaemun is pretty extensive so we didn't visit every nook and cranny though we did manage to get quite a few of the souvenirs and gifts we brought back from there. There is also a good street food scene and we had really nice tteokbokki from there and sampled some fish cakes. There was an interesting stall owner who would play the clarinet between sales which was cute. We also chanced upon this fairly hidden food alley which might have been kalguksu (noodle) alley. A good place to visit if you like to shop and eat! Also not too far from Myeongdong so easy to wander over if that's your base.
574,4,"Our hotel was just 10 mins away, so we usually go through the Namdaemun market everyday. It?셲 one big market that sells the same or similar things. The market was confusing at first since every stores looked alike, but after a few times of getting lost we finally figured out the directions. From this market is about another 8-10 mins walk to the other popular M market. There were also a few food stands but not sure if it?셲 good or not."
575,4,Lots of items. I found some really low priced souvenirs but you have to ask as they are on the second floor and inside
576,5,This market is quite interesting. Lots to shop and so much to see. It is a whole day activity. I suggest you take the metro to get to this market as it leads you straight to the beginning of the market.
577,4,"Namdaemum Market in Seoul is worth visiting for a number of reasons. First, it's a good cultural experience: you see lots of artefacts and food items you might not have the chance of finding at home (if you are a Westerner). Second, if you need souvenirs to take home, here you have a rich range, all at hand and at very convenient prices. Third, if you are fond of intercultural experience, the market is a good place for communicating with the locals and for exchanging opinions on the products (and on South Korea, in general) with other foreigners.The only danger you may face is that of getting lost!"
578,1,"Nothing interesting. Do not go in fish restaurant area, it was a terrible experience. Bad food bad service."
579,5,"Be sure not to reach too early as the shops are mostly open only after 9:30am. So, have a good breakfast before you head down. Do take note that this market isn?셳 open on Sunday. Right across The Courtyard at Marriot, Namdaemun Market is made up of street stalls, shops lining the streets on ground level of old buildings and old shopping malls (selling wholesale clothes, jewelry etc). Just roam and explore, u will find surprises in every corner. Stuff mostly for kids and women, not so much for men. Chanced upon a mall that sell nothing but children clothes. They are meant to be for wholesale and pre-order but they do sell single pieces too. Saw so many of these children clothes selling at Doota Mall (Dongdaemun) at double or triple the price. Be sure not to buy them at Doota. There is also another mall that sells just clothes for adults. It?셲 hard to give directions as they are like hidden gems amongst the many street stalls. If u happen to be in the mall selling jewelry, don?셳 be alarm if the stall owners refuse to sell single pieces to you. They are for bulk purchases and pre-order. You are lucky if u found a couple of friendly ones that don?셳 mind selling the jewelry in pieces to you. The hair clips especially are very pretty."
580,2,"Went to visit Namdaemun Market late night. Got 5 small dishes and 2 sodas with my wife. The bill came out to ??11,000 or $109.00. Are you kidding me? That price is more than our food bills for 3 days combined. A ver bad experience indeed."
581,4,"There are many alleys filled with shops selling a variety of things ranging from food to tshirts to fashion accessories. Quite a number of buildings with wholesale accessories (earrings, necklaces etc) shops. The Alpha stationery building was a letdown. At a small alley selling bibimbup and noodles, we ordered 2 dishes and got a number of other dishes for free! Truly authentic Korean food!"
582,5,Went early morning to check the market.  Bought some korean spoon set.  Tried their breads and gimbap for breakfast.
583,4,"Food and shopping are the best. Local food and wholesale is found here, walking distance from Mydeong shopping area, grab a sandwich along the way, shoes n shirts at cheap price. Be prepare to walk and enjoy the fun of shopping, step into the aircon building and open another area to shop."
584,1,"Full of low quality overpriced Chinese products, people shoving and elbowing without pause, nasty fermented Korean food smells, and rats all over the place."
585,2,"2nd time coming here and still seem to miss the action. The last time we were too early coming before our flight, this time we were too late as most of the stalls and shops were closing. We were there just before dinner of about 7.30pm. The girls were disappointed."
586,5,Variety of localy priduced clothes and goods. From tshirt to tops to leather jackets to hats they have it all. And the street food stalls spread around exit 5 to fill your tummy if you are hungry or treat your taste buds
587,4,It has something for everybody here and have sufficient variety that it is quite a good place to get everything.
588,4,"Nice place to see all fresh Korean food. Plenty of vendors convince you to get some food. During winter they'd provide heater under the long chair which it was nicely warm. They are selling dumpling with the soup (Mandu), blood pudding (sundae), raw octopus, chilli pickled cabbage (kimchi), hot&spicy rice cake (toppokki), Korean sushi roll (gimbap), etc. Very convenient to reach as it located in the centre."
589,5,"Namdaemun market feels like a friendly street market environment, which is a welcome reprieve from other ""pushy"" and rude again markets in other Asian countries. Go and sample delicious street cuisine and explore various clothing stalls to find something unique."
590,5,"Great place to wander, try foods (yes, the place seems a bit sketchy, but feel free to eat! You?셪l be fine and may have your best meal!), pick up souvenirs, and enjoy!"
591,5,"Loved the fish stew alley...we ended up coming here about 4-5 times. Awesome spicy fish stew for about 8,000 krw and also getting the local experience where many Koreans come. Once you find the food district, they have alleyways all dedicated to the same type of food...the hairtail fish stew was one made of chili, radish and the fish and that was all they carried. So if you are in a group and some cannot handle it, this is not the place to go.  Aside from the food, this is a market which sells cheap goods...not a whole lot of bargaining here and the goods can be quite expensive for fake products so beware."
592,3,"It is a market were you can find multiple things ( hand bags, stationary, jewel, clothing, too, umbrellas and more). It is a huge complex and besides what you see in the street there are doors with an inside commerce."
593,4,There are several markets in Seoul this one has a nice verity but I found the prices higher than some of the more specialized markets.  That being said the food options were good and there was lots of interesting items for sale.
594,3,"A traditional market for people of all ages. It depicts quite well the kind of lifestyle people have, from the young to elderly. The market sells clothes, household stuff and food."
595,5,Doesn?셳 matter how old you are but you will have a good time here day or night!!! And I think they keep most An Korea old style trade and have a lot new thing too !! They sell everything here and lot a good food too I mean all kind of food west or east what ever!!! We love come here to eat and walk around
596,4,"# Easy to get here via Subway Line 4 (Hoehyeon Station, Exit 5). # Variety of stalls & shops of clothing, shoes, bags, souvenirs, handicrafts, food, fruits & groceries too. Do get the market's map, it is big and all streets almost looking the same as all streets filled with variety of goods. # Some stalls can get good bargains if intended to buy lots. Generally, all stall/shop owners are very polite. They don't force buying from them. # English is not widely use in this market, but all stall/shop owners are approachable. When comes to pricing & bargaining, calculator will be the tool & medium to conclude the deal."
597,5,"Visited twice one time on a Sunday. Shops were closed but streets were lined with hawkers and clothes sellers. Prices were very good too.  During another weekday visit, the place came to live with shops all open and streets were still filled with foodstalls and clothes sellers. Plenty to see and do and buy as well.  Shopping here is good and with more competitive prices than Bangkok for clothes as well. Tourists Guides are positioned on the streets to help tourists with questions and information. Nice place to visit near Myeongdong."
598,5,"We spent about 1.5 hrs waking around and exploring the market. Plenty to see if you go in the morning if you like look at fresh produce and seafood. They sell lots of accessories, souvenirs and clothes but don?셳 expect high fashion and chic products here.  The street food here is more traditional and tastier than in Myeong-Dong. Look for the yummy freshly made dumplings right in the middle of the market, they are cheap and delicious."
599,4,"Much cheaper here than in the supermarkets and/or Myeongdong for souvenirs such as seaweed, purses and Korean cutlery sets. There's loads to see here and can easily spend a morning here. They have a little food street too and the market is divided into different sections like kidswear, accessories, clothes, etc.  We enjoyed strolling through the market and got a few last minute gifts. Worth a visit."
600,4,Don?셳 hesitate to go visit the place. This is amazing to see the shopping temptations all over the area.
601,5,Look for the alley with fish stew... There are many shops there and they serve simple food. Did not disappoint even when I?셶e tried a few different shops. Prices are not that expensive too - 6-8k per pax could give you a wonderful meal.
602,4,"Mostly shops lol But if you are looking for fancy korean (Kpop/Kdrama) jewelries, this is the place to be! And they also have a lot of kids' wear! Clothes for ahjussis and ahjummas are widely available as well hahaha There are also restos in some areas, odeng that's only 500??and heotteok tho not as good as the ones I had in Busan, but still good enough. This place is worth a visit."
603,4,We had a lovely time at the Namdaemun Market. There were an assortment of wares on sales as well as street food to taste. A great attraction in Seoul
604,4,"Big, big and more big. A lot af market stall. Walk, see and buy. IT takes you a lot of time to walk around the whole marker, but no problem, you can visit this market every day and iT is naar the centrum and the grand station"
605,5,Good place for budget travellers. Many items are relatively cheap. But Bangkok and KL are way much better and cheaper
606,5,"Great real street market feeling. Here is where locals do their market shopping, with a few tourists in between. You'll find typical Korean food - not always to the taste of Westeners, so be prepared for it! But if you like typical local street food, then this is definitely the place to go!"
607,5,"We had many of our meals over here and got to know many of the local stall holders and the food was to die for. You can always get a bargain but do your homework first. know the exchange rate from your own currency to won and know the cost of items back home. always good to get a bargain but not at either your expense or the expense of the stall holder. You will not see all this market has to offer in a couple of hours and don't be afraid to go down the alleyways and side streets, this is a huge place as are many of the markets. You will find some great bargains and memorable food. Don't forget to take your camera."
608,5,"This market is easy to get to via taxi - I just showed them a photo of it on Trip Advisor and the driver knew right where to go. I spent a couple hours walking through the streets and shops. Plenty of people there and a lot of great street food. The vendors mostly speak English which made communication easy. When it was time to go, taxi's were waiting at most of the gates."
609,2,"Namdaemun Market is busy and filled to the brim with great street food, cheap souvenirs, and a general variety of goods. If this is what you're looking for, then it's definitely worth a visit. There are so many vendors that you could probably spend the good part of a day if you wanted to visit them all. However we spent less than an hour because it just wasn't for us; the crowds were extreme and most of them tourists, and stall owners would be calling us from every side trying to sell this and that - most of it things you would find hard to explain a real need for.  I do have to praise the food. It is cheap, and most of it is fresh and made before you. It's also eaten by locals which is always a good sign. I just didn't see much value in the shops' stock and didn't enjoy the busy tourist crowds. There are other markets I would rather frequent."
610,5,"The streets here are wider than Myeong Dong and prices of food might be cheaper too. Since we were travelling with stroller, we were not able to penetrate or go in Myeong Dong as the place was packed when we went. So we opted to go here instead.  We bought some socks, belt, jeans, facial wash, and ate tons of street food. We loved the store that sold dumplings and meat buns."
611,4,"This market is very big with lots of entrance leading to different sections. It is an open air market with buildings on the side which, each building specialized in different products. There are sections and building specialized in infant to children's clothes, shoes and accessories, men's items, jewelries, mattresses, ladies shoes, clothes etc. There is even a section where you can find alteration services. Things a relatively cheap and even cheaper if buy in bulk as they sell stuff in wholesale prices. Do drop by this market if you are in the vicinity and their shops open early too."
612,4,"A great local atmosphere, you will find diversity of food, articles and accessories, closing, and much more, this is a place to go in the morning and get a fantastic breakfast with locales...."
613,5,"Loved the assortment of shops here! From the street stalls to the stores inside multistorey building, every shopper should be able to find something to take home! Besides clothing and cosmetics, there are entire levels selling ladies' accessories, clothing, cooking ware, home decor, artificial flowers, etc. If you are a keen shopper, you will need to plan easily 2-4 hours here. There is also at least 2 side streets selling local Korean dishes."
614,2,"Huge area, many multi store buildings. Most of the merchandise is junk, just there is really really, really many kinds and piles of junk."
615,4,"A diversified market. From clothing, bags, stationery, accessories, shoes, cameras to hiking gear. They have it. They also have restaurants and cafes that serve very good Korean food."
616,4,"Our guide said this was the best market in Seouk for shopping. Many vendors have their own factories to produce goods for sale at better quality and prices than elsewhere. Certain types of goods are concentrated on named streets. Lots and lots of shops and places to eat - some just stalls, others are full service sit down. We spent almost 2 hours strolling and eating in the neighborhood."
617,5,"A very busy market in the heart of the city where toy get literally from A to Z. Qualitywise not necessarily to notch, but fun to browse through the narrow alleys and to take in the bit so familiar scents. If you have a tenancy to be claustrophobic, I would not recommend a visit during busy hours. At times you're blocked but people, hardly able to move forward or backward, neither left or right... and in parts underground.  I enjoy observing the hustle and bustle of people and browsing for a typical Joann item (like brass dishes or similar)  Generally it's mostly about clothing, but my size is never available neither my style.  Very close by for larger wallets the first Shinsegae hosting upscale designer boutiques and a nice food section in B1  On the other end of the market, the name giving Nandaemun, the former city gate and national treasure No.1 ( it sadly burned down ca. 10 yrs ago, but was restored to it's full glory)  All in all go and visit as it's truly any experience!"
618,5,"When you love bargain items, this is a must visit market. You can find korean made clothes, accessories, kitchen utensils and many more. Many coffee stalls too. Easy to access."
619,5,"Namdaemun is one of the best markets to visit in Seoul and sells a very large variety of goods. If you want clothes, food, souvenirs or even cameras then this is the place to come. The market is divided into general areas where you can find specific items (children's clothing section, camera section, etc). The market is particularly famous for its camera section which offers decent prices on both new and second hand cameras from all brands. Fuji and Olympus users may have some trouble here, but Nikon, Canon, and Sony are well represented. For electronics alone though, Yongsan is better."
620,1,This market is full of counterfeited goods and just junk in general. Myeongdong and Insadong are both much better.
621,5,I am so amazed in this very clean market. I enjoyed variety of goods being sold. If you are a foreigner in this country and love to cook this is the best place to buy the ingredients. I think the prices are reasonable enough. You just have to go around first to know who sell with least price.
622,5,This market seems to be a lower market compared to the Myeongdong Market just a block down the road. I thought that there was a bit more food options here and it was cheaper. Walked past a Hotteok stand and had to get one cause it just smelt so nice. There were plenty of shops and stalls lining the road which seemed to be cheaper too. Plenty of entrances around so shouldn't be too difficult to find. Seems more like a local market than a tourist one which is why I thought it was a nice change.
