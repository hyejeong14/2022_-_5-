All from souvenirs, through food, snacks and beverages to wholesale. And all the way through, you meet smiling people. If you don't have days to spend there, at least give it a try of a few hours, it's worth it. And one more thing; It's clean, nice and clean and nice.

6,Janet1016,4,"My husband, son and I visited Seoul, South Korea for the very first time the end of January. Our Hotel, the Tmark Grand Hotel, was within walking distance of the Namdaemun Market and we visited it numerous times over the course of the week we were there.  I'm not a big shopper but I am a foodie and we ate in a couple of restaurants in the Market as well as sampling some of the street foods and I also purchased some Honey Butter Almonds, which are a very popular foodie souvenir to buy when in South Korea, at a lower price than if you go to an actual shop that specializes in them (of which there are MANY). :)  I love Night Markets. Coming from Canada I can't get enough of them when I visit Asia. Everything looks so FOREIGN! LOL! I saw all manner of fresh fruits for sale, spices, clothing, foodie treats, and much, much more.  The Market, which is the largest traditional Market in South Korea, has over 10,000 vendors, retailers and wholesalers. It is a dense maze of stalls and restaurants. One night while we were looking for a spot to get some dinner we came out of a back alley to be faced with a stunning Old City Gate right across the street which turned out to be Sungnyemun Gate, South Korea's #1 National Treasure. You honestly never know what is going to be around the next corner.  Merchants have been selling items near this location since 1414 AD!!!!! There is an information booth with people in it that do speak some English which is super helpful. They also have free maps so you can orient yourself. We went to the Information booth one evening for a restaurant recommendation and were pleased.  Just go wander.....it's uber fun!","Written February 27, 2020"
7,Culinary-Consultants,5,"Dear colleague travelers, here I leave you a review for the one and only market worthy of a visit in Seoul: The Namdaemun Market. Filled with excitement, strange and curious things, lots of interesting street food, raw food ingredients, music, clothing, souvenirs and its booming with people.  Still the rule of South Koreans is not to understand a word of English; but in this market like everywhere in South Korea; be ready for price rise as soon as they see you coming and being a non-Korean. Speculation is in the air.  Most of the things you'll be able to buy when it comes to clothing and souvenirs; is cheap worthless Chinese crap. But concentrate on the raw products and on the street food. At least prices are exposed and the prices are the same for foreigners and locals alike.  Just walk around (watch your pockets) as there are some suspicious persons in the area. Don't spend much (you will be tempted) but remember most of the souvenirs globally are cheap Chinese products that you'll end up throwing away.  In Korea you need to concentrate on walking a lot as there is plenty to walk, take fresh air, don't spend on garbage, have some curious food and the points of Interest are to be museums, palaces and all related to this activities. (museums and monuments, places, etc are really cheap). This is my advise.  We recommend this market as the ONLY one worth. The rest is just copy and paste.","Written February 1, 2020"

The first time, I chalked it up to an off day. We all have those. But 3 times within 6 months, don't think it is a coincidence anymore.  I don't know if it is because they have become tired of tourists or something else. But it leaves a bad impression and I won't go back.

For sure it is very contaminated by tourism, and it has probably lost most of its characteristic atmosphere. Anyway I enjoyed my visit there, I only wished to have had more time to explore it better!","Written September 3, 2019"

They have tons of different souvenirs to choose from such as kitchenwares, clothings for adults and kids, stationeries, accessories, to beauty products, and more. They also have food alleys that's definitely budget-friendly.  Another thing that I love here is that the tourist information people are everywhere! They have english-speaking personnel and other language experts that you can talk to and ask about directions and all. They're easy to find since they're wearing red uniforms and hold placards.

77,don s,5,So there is the day time shopping and night time shopping. If your looking for kids clothes you can come after 10pm to 5am. On #6 you can find many kids clothing stores. The key to getting a discount is buy more than one piece. I think the minimum is 3 and up. So we bought on this trip maybe 9 of the same kids sleep sack different colors and sizes to give to friends and it was much cheaper. For example a kids hat I bought was 15000won each but if I buy more than 3 it?ôs 9000won. If I buy three I save 3000won and get 3 hats! Anyway this is the deal and for accessories you need to buy by the dozens and many styles. The last time I came I bought hairpins for my kids and friends. They come out to 50cents each very cheap. There is usually less people at night and this is when the wholesale customers come so just be aware to get deals you must buy more. Also make sure you bring cash. This also helps since most money exchanges close before 10pm. Good luck shopping.,"Written August 21, 2019"

Besides fixed shops offering baked goods and pigs??feet, there are stalls selling skewers which average about 3,000-5,000 won. Each stall sells almost exactly the same selection at almost the same price. There are alleyways off the main streets in which you can find sit-down restaurants selling the usual Korean fare - bulgogi, noodles, cuttlefish etc. I went into one of these and had spiced cold noodles with boiled egg.  From the stalls I had rather some chewy octopus skewers and average chicken skewers, some bland fried shrimp and a nondescript sugared dumpling. I wouldn?ôt repeat the experience.  Overall I was really disappointed. Having lived in China I came expecting a high standard of street food but this was nothing to write home about. I have seen much better markets in very rural areas of other parts of Asia, so I was surprised at just how uninspiring this one was given that Seoul is such a large and international city. In fact I would venture to say it?ôs the worst market I?ôve ever been to.  As for the products for sale, they are primarily Supreme imitation hoodies and other paraphernalia, and trinket shops.

209,Rumples,5,"I stayed near this traditional market during a recent visit to Seoul and visited three times. Huge, the place has eight numbered gates; more than 10,000 stores in buildings and stalls; merchandise ranging from flowers to military equipment; and food carts. It seems to be the liveliest in the morning, when I encountered thick crowds, and rather quiet in the late afternoon. The market obviously attracts shoppers, based on the transactions I saw taking place, but also visitors with cameras, soaking up the atmosphere and enjoying photo ops.  I went for the atmosphere but ended up returning to seek out inexpensive souvenirs, such as bookmarks and fans. Though I looked at other items, including clothing and accessories, nothing appealed. Much better quality can be found in nearby department stores but with higher prices.  My favorite part of the market proved to be the ubiquitous food carts, where vendors prepare all kinds of yummy-looking fare. I finally got in a long line waiting for a hotteok (deep-fried veggie pancake) by Gate 2. It took about 20 minutes before I could put my order in and I received the hotteok almost immediately. The cost was 1,000 KRW, about $1 U.S. I stood on the street, eating this tasty delight and savoring every bite.  It is easy to get lost in this complex of pedestrian streets and buildings, so I suggest getting a map from the market's information kiosk before starting to explore. Enter from Gate 2 at Namdaemun-ro or Gate 5 at Toegye-ro. The kiosk stands on the street that connects the two gates, near the souvenir shops.  Namdaemun Market is easily accessed by subway (lines 1, 2, 4) and many bus lines. It takes about 15 minutes to walk there from Seoul Station.","Written November 17, 2018"

Once you do find it take a seat at any of the many soup stalls. You?ôll be knocking elbows with fellow eaters. There?ôs no way around this due to the very small space and high demand of the food served. The alley is only about 20 yards long. Most stalls serve soup noodles and bibimbap.

I have not seen this Korea food being offered in other places while i was visiting Seoul and Busan during my 9 day trip in June 2018, so i suppose that this might be the only place easiest to find for such a type of Korea specialty.  This fish dish is so popular that there was even 2 alley within the Namdaemum market dedicated to selling this dish. With many shops offering almost the same time, you would just need to look for one that would seem to be the most popular.  As there was no English signboards for most of the shops, we simply resorted to pointing at what the other tables were having and we were not disappointed.  My family of 3 person order 1 portion of Hairtail Fish and 1 portion of Fried Assorted Fish which came with some free side dishes such as pickles, beans, Eggs, and fried fish and rice. Iced water is always provided free at the table as well.  But do note that this fish does have quite abit of bones and the stew is mildly spicy.

They are selling dumpling with the soup (Mandu), blood pudding (sundae), raw octopus, chilli pickled cabbage (kimchi), hot&spicy rice cake (toppokki), Korean sushi roll (gimbap), etc. Very convenient to reach as it located in the centre.","Written June 16, 2018"

318,Alistair L,5,"Loved the fish stew alley...we ended up coming here about 4-5 times. Awesome spicy fish stew for about 8,000 krw and also getting the local experience where many Koreans come. Once you find the food district, they have alleyways all dedicated to the same type of food...the hairtail fish stew was one made of chili, radish and the fish and that was all they carried. So if you are in a group and some cannot handle it, this is not the place to go.  Aside from the food, this is a market which sells cheap goods...not a whole lot of bargaining here and the goods can be quite expensive for fake products so beware.","Written June 14, 2018"

During another weekday visit, the place came to live with shops all open and streets were still filled with foodstalls and clothes sellers. Plenty to see and do and buy as well.  Shopping here is good and with more competitive prices than Bangkok for clothes as well. Tourists Guides are positioned on the streets to help tourists with questions and information. Nice place to visit near Myeongdong.","Written June 5, 2018"

You can always get a bargain but do your homework first. know the exchange rate from your own currency to won and know the cost of items back home. always good to get a bargain but not at either your expense or the expense of the stall holder. You will not see all this market has to offer in a couple of hours and don't be afraid to go down the alleyways and side streets, this is a huge place as are many of the markets. You will find some great bargains and memorable food. Don't forget to take your camera.","Written May 23, 2018"

336,LakridsKaffe,2,"Namdaemun Market is busy and filled to the brim with great street food, cheap souvenirs, and a general variety of goods. If this is what you're looking for, then it's definitely worth a visit. There are so many vendors that you could probably spend the good part of a day if you wanted to visit them all. However we spent less than an hour because it just wasn't for us; the crowds were extreme and most of them tourists, and stall owners would be calling us from every side trying to sell this and that - most of it things you would find hard to explain a real need for.  I do have to praise the food. It is cheap, and most of it is fresh and made before you. It's also eaten by locals which is always a good sign. I just didn't see much value in the shops' stock and didn't enjoy the busy tourist crowds. There are other markets I would rather frequent.","Written May 21, 2018"

Since we were travelling with stroller, we were not able to penetrate or go in Myeong Dong as the place was packed when we went. So we opted to go here instead.

344,Heiko S,5,"A very busy market in the heart of the city where toy get literally from A to Z. Qualitywise not necessarily to notch, but fun to browse through the narrow alleys and to take in the bit so familiar scents. If you have a tenancy to be claustrophobic, I would not recommend a visit during busy hours. At times you're blocked but people, hardly able to move forward or backward, neither left or right... and in parts underground.  I enjoy observing the hustle and bustle of people and browsing for a typical Joann item (like brass dishes or similar)  Generally it's mostly about clothing, but my size is never available neither my style.  Very close by for larger wallets the first Shinsegae hosting upscale designer boutiques and a nice food section in B1  On the other end of the market, the name giving Nandaemun, the former city gate and national treasure No.1 ( it sadly burned down ca. 10 yrs ago, but was restored to it's full glory)  All in all go and visit as it's truly any experience!","Written May 14, 2018"

The market is particularly famous for its camera section which offers decent prices on both new and second hand cameras from all brands.

Plenty of entrances around so shouldn't be too difficult to find. Seems more like a local market than a tourist one which is why I thought it was a nice change.,"Written May 11, 2018"
