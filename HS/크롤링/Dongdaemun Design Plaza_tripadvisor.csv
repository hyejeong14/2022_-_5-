0,Traveller of the world,4.0,"Yes, the structure is stunning. Amazing architecture. Great atmosphere and lot's going on. However, expected more in terms of exhibitions. This changes throughout the year. Some boutique shops inside and eateries. I just think they could have made better use of the indoor space. Clean and well kept. Definitely recommend going.","Written May 30, 2022"
1,Shikataganai73,4.0,Interesting art pieces around the plaza. Inside is a museum with special exhibits at times. Right outside is the Seoul City Tour double decker bus which you can buy a ticket for to enjoy sites around the area.,"Written June 9, 2021"
2,SQKrisflyer,5.0,"I spent an hour and half walking and admiring, in the night, this structure that was designed by late Zaha Hadid, an Iraqi-born British world-renowned architect. It has certainly inspired me on the “Dream, Design and Play” (DDP) concept behind the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP).  Getting there: Take Subway Line 2, 4, 5 to get to Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station and then take exit 1, which is connected to the DDP. Once you walk out the exit of subway station, the DDP just on the left. Climb the lighted stairs to reach the street level for appreciation of DDP.  The attraction: If you are at the DDP during the day, I would recommend a walk around the DDP to appreciate of the unique architecture of the structure – it is built on curves and I did not see any sharp corner and long straight walls! It is mentioned that over 40,000 aluminium panels cover the DDP exterior of which none is the same. I would also recommend a walk inside the DDP - consists of a sky lounge, rest area, souvenir shop and 5 exhibition halls: Art Hall, Museum, Design Laboratory, Oullim Square and Dongdaemun History & Culture Park.  It is at night when the DDP really came alive! The lightings simply accentuate and dazzle the structure. Most of the yellow-white lightings even “moved” where these gradually intensified and then dimmed again. Participating in the “night life” is the Rose Garden with a total of some 25,550 LED roses.  Not only the architecture dazzled at night, the artistic talent was also on show when I saw and heard 2 different pianists playing the 2 pianos located in the open.  I walked across to the apM Place Shopping Mall and took the elevator to a high floor to get a bird’s eye view of DDP. I think you can also get a nice view from the high floor of other buildings (for example the Lotte Fitin Shopping Mall)  Overall, I enjoyed Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) in the night more than in the day. Nevertheless, this is one iconic landmark in Seoul that you would not want to miss! It is no wonder that many Korean dramas were filmed here as well, including “You Who Came from the Stars”, “Producer” and “She Was Pretty”.","Written August 31, 2020"
3,GlobetrotterJ16,4.0,"DDP is Zaha Hadid design and definitely the icon of Dongdaemun. There are a couple of subway stations that stop directly underneath or nearby, hence easy to get to. The Plaza overall is quite large in size, with shops, exhibitions and art installations. There are leaderboards with maps in many locations hence easy to find your way around. Nearby DDP are underground shopping, night markets, Dongdaemum Gate, a couple fo hotels and plenty of shops and restaurants. Dongdaemun and DDP are must visit sights when in Seoul.","Written July 19, 2020"
4,AndrianiBg,5.0,Zaha Hadid’s Dongdaemun Design Park &Plaza is the highlight of my trip to South Korea.

8,William K,2.0,For me it was a bit disappointing visiting S. Korea. I can feel a bit of tension wherever I would go around the city. The people were not as warm as expected.

14,nicarafiki,5.0,"A short walk from the JW Marriott Dongdaemun Square Seoul leads to one of the world’s most impressive and incredible architectural designs, the free flowing futuristic structure of the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (known as the DDP) where history marries the present and embraces the future. Designed by the late internationally acclaimed Pritzker Architecture Prize recipient, visionary Zaha Hadid, Dongdaemun Design Plaza, frequented by both tourists and locals, greets all with the notable humanistic art of architecture. It imparts a feeling of liquid, fluid metal. Seoul, the capital city of South Korea, home to 10 million people, is a modern world mega-city, designated in the year 2010 as the “World Design Capital.” It is indeed fitting that he Dongdaemun Design Plaza so elegantly captures the beauty and energy of Seoul.  The Dongdaemun Design Plaza is home to the Dongdaemun History and Culture Park, featuring the Dongdaemun Relic Area 2, an archaeological site discovered at the former baseball field of the Dongdaemun Stadium Complex, yielding knowledge about the life of Korean people during the Joseon period. The tile-paved path believed to relate to the Japanese colonial period connects the building sites and the Well Site and Fireplace Feature depicted along the path. The dual-languages of the signage of the site are Korean and English. In the midst of this extraordinary mega-city of Seoul, resides peace and tranquility.  The Dongdaemun Design Plaza also is home to eateries, coffee shops, art, gigantic sculptures, a rooftop park, bi-lingual tours of the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, and so much more to experience.","Written February 8, 2020"
15,Culinary-Consultants,5.0,"There is very little I can tell you about this outstanding and gorgeous piece of engineering and architecture. Designed by world renowned architect, Zaha Hadid who is an Iraqi/British citizen..  The place has conveniently allocated metro entrances beneath the structure. I think 3 to be precise. Before you get to the building there is a mayor plaza and a walking street/ramp that leads you to the heart of it. The entrance is beneath the full structure.  The DDP of its name means: Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) has the meaning of 'Dream, Design and Play' as far as I was informed. The place is also famous and renowned for it has staged diverse cultural events including exhibitions, fashion shows, product launch shows, forums and conferences.  DDP's exterior features over 40,000 aluminum panels, none of which are the same. As I mentioned before the plaza is home to various exhibition spaces, design museum, sky lounge, rest area and a souvenir shop.  Is really a beauty of Art, and Architecture as well as Technology.

This is the place for those that do not fancy the bazaar style shopping as in Namdaemun market. This place has a few big malls for fashion mostly. It has even has two underground shopping malls.

29,jwlyon1,2.0,"It is a iconic piece of architecture on a monumental scale. It was a huge disappointment though, there was almost no content and so much of the museum space was closed or empty. The shopping area was billed as a design market, it was not at all curated as “design” goods. The remains of historical buildings in and amongst the futuristic mega buildings were the most interesting parts of the park. Overall, the sheer bleakness of the interior was fascinating, but I was very frustrated at the lack of museum content. The one small exhibit gallery with exhibits in it was okay, but not of a scale to fit this giant park. So, be aware that besides the giant swooping building, there isn’t anything else to see.  The central stair in the design building is amazing, there is some striking architecture.","Written December 9, 2019"

46,Rumples,5.0,"As an architecture buff, I found this plaza in Seoul to feature one of the most innovative modern structures that I have seen. I first visited the 7-level (4 above ground and 3 below) building during the day and was so impressed that I returned to introduce the center to my husband that night. Designed by architect Zaha Hadid, the futuristic construction exhibits no straight lines or right angles. Instead, it presents elongated, curvy forms, built with concrete and cloaked in 45,000 aluminum panels.  At night, the center’s lights seem to glow from within. At certain exterior vantage points, its shape and silvery hue give the impression of what I imagine a giant spaceship to look like. The park next to the building further enhances the look. It holds 25,550 LED roses, which light up 5 minutes after sunset and are absolutely stunning. It was a magical experience to stroll here in the dark.  Inside, the curves continue in long corridors and connecting stairways (there are also standard elevators). The center serves as a fairly new venue for design in Seoul, featuring an art hall, meeting space, a museum, a design lab and a design market. I visited the huge lab, which displays a variety of well-crafted items for sale and gives visitors the opportunity to meet the designers. We enjoyed a light dinner in one of the many eateries in the market, which is connected to the nearby Dongdaemun shopping centers.  DDP, located in Downtown Seoul, is easily reached by subway. Take Line 2, 4 or 5 to Dongdaemun History and Culture Park Station and leave through exits 1 or 10.","Written October 31, 2019"

A staircase with an oddly angled and brown contrasting steps brought us back down.  The building and surrounding areas were open 24 hours a day. I walked around for free inside but to visit any of the exhibits or museums you just had to pay an admission fee (roughly W16000 for adults). On the ground floor was a temporary exhibit on Disney animation which seemed to be quite popular. There also was a Disney store and lots of silkscreened animation scenes from the likes of Frozen, Big Hero 6, and Moana. On the second floor was an art museum. On the third floor was a children’s play area, some collaboration space and on the roof, a viewing area and a cafe. In the back was a lush landscaped area with seating, a piano and various art pieces. In the front was a large courtyard where lots of people were congregated.

They have this attraction which we visited and waited for hours the so-called led rose garden where hundreds or thousands of roses automatically light up as the sun sets. It was a nice view as the night went deeper. There are also have art hall, museum, design lab, design market, culture and history park but most of them were closed when we were there.

Yes, amidst Seoul’s skyline, the DDP’s facade is aesthetically unique for it’s fluid lines and steel curvatures. There is no doubt, its sheer outline exudes design.  But once, we appreciated the swooping façade and geometries, there is just emptiness inside the building: empty rooms, empty echoey corridors and vast empty spaces. For a designer, space is a design element but when we went (around 4 pm on April 17) there were no exhibits, no permanent showcase not even, food trucks. Just one big EMPTY building.  OK, if you are a modern architecture design nut (and enjoy photographing shapes) but, you might want to skip this if you have mixed group.

I've been in Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) several times and every time I go there is always a new experience, I never get bored of that place. There are so many things you can do there, take a look at the art and design galleries, there are also food festivals at night so you can try Korean and western food as well. Inside the building, you will see galleries, souvenirs shops, coffee shops and more.  If you have an Instagram profile then you can check the Instagram profile of Dongdaemun Design Plaza and you can see what they have to offer because they upload a schedule of their monthly activities there.

What makes it even better is that there is a very large kids play area on the top floor that provided hours of (air-conditioned) fun for our kids on a very hot day. In a busy city like Seoul that does not have a tremendous amount of activities for kids (note we live in Sydney, Australia so we're very spoilt for choice) this can be an absolute life saver and I don't understand why the play area is not advertised more.

It was so full of information, that one visit would not be enough to soak in all the knowledge. We had a tour guide and that worked out really well because she saved us from having to read and glean all the information ourselves. She highlighted everything for us and answered all our questions.

344,Lou M,3.0,"The Dongdaemun design plaza is a beautiful structure. You can find here a few big fashion musea with a few big event halls, although I never had the luck to visit anyone of them. Everytime I visit the place (about every couple of months) there are no events. The design plaza is a good place to relax in a quiet place, away from the buzz outside in the many fashion shopping malls right beside.","Written September 14, 2017"
345,Agampodi,4.0,You don't see this type of building in your day to day life. A moden marvel of architecture. A place where people who love archetecture can enjoy. (my kids were not interested though),"Written September 12, 2017"

347,Sabrina_witchy,5.0,"What started as an attempt to see the flowery lights that we only see in kdrama's . I was surprised to find that on the Saturday night that there will be loads of food trucks lines up in the vicinity of the DDP. Boy the choices was good... looking the portion of some of the order it was also quite filling and not to forget smells soo delicious. We just had dinner , therefor was too full .. But we did share a churros , which was awesome!! Crunchy on the outside with a soft chew fluffy insides .  Besides foodtrucks, there were selfmade artist selling their arts and also a blowup balloon arts that was everywhere .. a very good night out and loads of photo Opp's.!! Do checkout this is on the weekend. The night life from cheonggyecheon river to the malls opposite the DDP seems like its always busy with something during Saturday late evening to night... =)  TIPS: for those who doesnt have much time to spare in korea.. these places are all within walking distance to checkout - Cheonggyecheon River end - Grill Fish street - Dongdaemun Shopping Malls -Multiple BIngsu places -multiple Train stations nearby - if you come in the morning even have a historical landmark too""forgotten the name"". sorry... but the DDP is quite central easy to make it a landmark ""In-Case-Of-Lost"" among a big group.. =). ENjoy!!","Written September 8, 2017"
348,Traveller290394,4.0,"Dongdaemun is a pretty interesting place, with its countless street markets and architectural design, but it's nothing really more than a few photo ops, here or there. I do visit Dongdaemun frequently, to clear the head after a heavy night out, but there really isn't anything you would write home about. If you are into photography, it is a fantastic place to practice your depth of fields and length snapping, but it's nothing compared to the palaces you have on offer a mear 3 or 4 stops away in Jonggak or City hall. I suggest visiting only if you have bags of time and you are passing Dongdaemun on the subway.","Written September 7, 2017"
349,asriniruth,4.0,"If you are into Architecture, you must visit Dongdaemun Design Plaza. I went here with great expectations and totally amazed with the building - although I am not a fans of zaha hadid style of Architecture. The building itself is breathtaking, because of its enormous size, and also because the architecture is so unusual. The building features a shapely facade made up of aluminium panels.  One of a must visit place in Seoul.","Written September 7, 2017"
