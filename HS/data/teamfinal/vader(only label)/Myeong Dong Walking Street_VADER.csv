Visit Lucky Factory and Brand Market for affordable shirts and t-shirts. Beware of pushy salespeople, you can typically just ignore if you are not interested. As night dawns, street food stalls are set up. There are many restaurants to choose from as well. There is a 8-storey Daiso nearby.",Negative
258,Full of great street food and awesome stores. I recommend trying fried chicken with cheese from one of the carts and u wont regret it i promise u. U literally can buy/eat anything from Myeongdong street. It's a MUST.,Positive
259,"Was nice to arrive via the metro at myeongdong station 6 and the street is in front of you. Very wide and relax street due to Covid and ample space. Nice shops for all and a few street venders. Great side streets with colorful signs and ambiance. Large shopping mall, small mall. Do not hesitate to enter as branded shops are sometime hidden in a small place. Many restaurants for all tastes. Very nice evening with the family. Do recommend this much better than large group mall. Enjoy.",Positive
260,"Gotta get here each time in Seoul, just because it's life! Every step is an adventure with an amazing display and adventure of trends and trinkets.",Positive
261,"Doesn't look like much when you walk past, but I was practically dying of hunger so I popped in. The definition of a hole-in-the-wall. I got the regular hamburger and wow... there are no words. A classic burger done right. Crisp bun, juicy patty, stuffed with all the essentials (ketchup, shredded lettuce, tomato, and pickles). There's about a million options available between the menu board and wall full of specials, so it can get a little overwhelming, but you really can't go wrong. Not much else to say besides go see for yourself! You won't be disappointed.",Positive

265,"Easy to Get lost, there are many of the same stores at walking distance so its Easy to get confused or disoriented; prices are really good for all korean beauty products and shoes, but you have to ready for room in your suitcase.

273,This was a unique shopping experience for the family. There were so many street vendors with just about anything you can think of and lots of food. There are also shops and restaurants in the buildings along the street with more selections than the street vendors so you really need to make a day of it if you have people with you that have the shopping bug.,Neutral
274,"many cosmetic and clothing sold the the stall but most sold at the same price. Some restaurants located need to walk the stair up before you can take the lift to the desired level hence not convenience for people who have problem climbing the stairs. Mobile tourist guide (international language) located at heart of myeongdong street, they are every helpful and get you to where you want including how to book tour trip. It will be a plus if there is more english signage to get around seoul",Positive

Cons-1) Their street food are quite pricey for a night market.Average arnd 3000 won for just about any finger food and taste just about average. 2- Can get lost easily as most places in there looks very similar. Nonetheless, a must visit when travelling to Seoul.",Positive
280,"the male street vendors make spitting or grunting noises and stare at people with impure, cynical and aggressive eyes. the female street vendors are loud brazen harpies who love to mess with people. depressing.  it used to be a historical place but not much sign of that anymore.",Negative
281,This place is fun for 15 minutes but then it is just way too much. It is; however a must see when in Seoul,Positive

283,"This is the place where you can shop any cosmetics and skincare brand in Seoul. They has plenty of shops that is heaven for ladies. On the other hand, the are a lots of street food vendor that makes the street more vibrant.  During my visit on winter holiday, the street was very crowded, even in the cold winter night, the street was very pack that makes it hard for you to walk.  Be careful with the sales ladies that give you for some free samples in front of cosmetics store, once you grab the free samples, they will not let you go until you buy something haha",Positive
284,"This is an awesome area to shop and have some delicious street food. At night the whole place comes alive and it's just great walking around exploring all the side streets and deciding which street food to try next.

We can back here many times and found something new each time to explore.",Positive
285,"If you are an avid skincare followers, you must go to Myeongdong street for an haul. But I didn't come to Myeongdong for skincare. The street food was reason I came the first time and turned out pretty goooddd. Next stop was Myeongdong Subway exit 6, where you can find heaven of kpop stuff. I bought some for myself hehe.",Positive

And they're surprisingly very cheap. Moat of stall sells food from 2,000 won per portion. Although I was mostly there looking for gifts and skincare products, this place is a must visit in Korea. I will definitely find a place very near to Myeongdong Street next time I visit Korea!",Positive
290,"There are so many shops and people walking the streets that it can be overwhelming if you're not accustomed to that. If you've never been to Seoul, try not to get sucked into one of the beauty stores (like me). They'll offer you something free and next thing you know, you've spent entirely too much money on facial masks!! LOL... It's fun but BE CAREFUL!! LOL",Positive
291,Super awesome place! I really love everything from here . Would like to go back again here! Super worth it,Positive
292,"Although it was fun to eat the street food, I found it better to eat in some random Korean BBQ restaurant. What makes this place are the makeup and beauty stores. My goodness you will never realize how much skin care and hair care you need (or think you need) until you enter one of these stores. My personal favorite was Tony Moly. If you aren't careful you can blow you entire budget on that street.",Positive
293,So there is so much street food and for fairly cheap. Also there is plenty of high end shops in the area. It is definitely a good spot to check out if it is you frist time in Korea.,Positive
294,"If you plan on shopping for k-beauty here, make sure you come before 2pm. Once the markets start it gets crazy busy. On the first night we thought it was a novelty but we quickly realised that some of the food wasn't as cheap as we thought. Some of them vendors reheat food by using those gas flame lighters so they're not fresh off the grill or reheated on it. As well as it being unbelievably busy, there was rubbish everywhere, it was a bit of a turn off. Worth a visit if you're into k-beauty though but wouldn't come here just for the food stalls. There are some decent restaurants around too in the area.",Positive
295,"There were always a lot of people.  We were only interested in snacks. Pretty expensive. Would recommend going to the local markets instead.  For example, a box of strawberries was sold at W15000 here and only W3500 at Mangwon market...  Nevertheless, it was a place with different variety of restaurants and shops.",Positive
296,should not miss this place. there are lots street food which are very Korean. you can go to restaurants or cafe. Shops - middle range. Crowded coz its popular.,Positive
297,"One of the most popular shopping districts in Seoul and for a reason. It's always crowded, especially during the evenings when all the street food carts are in full swing.

302,"Love the area... all sorts of street food that was amazing!!! Shopping stores left & ryt!!! Its a convinient place to buy all sorts of things. They also have local grill restos that served good food. We ate during Xmas eve at one of the grill resto- i forgot the name, but the meat was delicious!!!",Positive
303,"You would already know Myeongdong is good for getting cosmetics and skincare products. Would recommend you to try the street food that come out only at night.  Also if you plan on getting face /body masks, this is the place to get as they are still cheaper than duty free. Not for all products but most.",Positive
304,"fun experience especially at night! shop and eat till you drop. from street drop variety to cool hole in the wall restaurants, and beauty cosmetics and clothing shops- especially beautiful with all the lights in the evening!",Positive
305,"For first timers to Seoul, this place is ideal...with lots of food options and shopping to do...if you're here for the culinary and shopping experiences! You can have lunch and dinner at different restaurants every day/night (assuming your hotel provides breakfast). Lots of cosmetic shops, with vendors giving out free facial masks in front of their stores, in hopes to wheel you in. Some restaurants have a 2nd or 3rd floor, so do go in and check with host/hostess for availability, and don't just assume there's no seating when the main floor is full. There are lots of street vendors along Myeongdong-Ro (St) where they sell gimbaps, deep fried squids, etc...which you may fancy. For tourists, you will find good exchange rates in this area too. When we were there during Xmas/New Year, there were huge sales everywhere in Myeongdong shopping street… good time to go :)",Positive
306,"The people are friendly, although when they look like they are handing out samples of things, they are not, they will pull it back and tell you go into store. The street food is cheap but delicous! way to save money. American made clothes are really expensive, I saw very little Korean made clothing, The underground markets are reasonable. But my favorite was really trying all the different foods.",Positive
307,There's a lot of spot shopping in Seoul but this one is the best. Because they have good price. Low price but good quality. If you want some souvenir from Korea this is one place that you should come,Positive

309,"Amazing cosmetics shopping, many other shops too. Different kinds of street food. Very different and unusual experience.",Positive
310,Things are more expensive in Myeongdong than other locations in Seoul.  There are definitely more tourist in Myeongdong . It is very central to everything . But very crowded in Christmas .,Positive
311,"Astonishing lights, restaurants, and full of markets where everyone can purchase good for yourself and/or for presents to be offered to family, friends or relatives when coming over. There was the real life in the city of Seoul at night. No one should miss it when visiting and walking through the capital definitely (night and day as well) !",Positive
312,"This place is the best place in seoul. This place have everything like streetfood anykind of food you want myeongdong have it...also about shopping street they have everything you dont have to go anywhere in seoul. Everything sell in dongdaemun myeongdong have it....everything sell in gangnam myeongdong have...from shoes, clothing, bags and cosmetic they have complete all stuff",Positive
313,This area has all the beauty shops. Masks for every part of your body. Bought loads to take home to australia as it is all so cheap. Did not feel ripped off. Do your homework first as to what you want as it can be very over whelming. Evening food markets are amazing every thing was so good that we tried. A must is the kimchi dumplings and korean fried chicken not to mention the lobster tails. Very busy but very safe. Oh bought a few pairs odf adiddas footwear as very cheap.,Positive
314,"It's a well known fact that Myeong-dong is a beauty product wonderland and not to mention, beer and fried chicken.  It's a must go for any first timer in Seoul and also beauty products fanatics.  It's a lovely and vibrant place with tons of street food too. The only downsides are the animal cafes not letting kids in, a pity.",Positive
315,"First time or frequent visitors, this place is a must! Street food stalls are by 4pm everyday until past midnight. Shops and shops and shops, and restaurants after restaurants, cafes and salons and OMG everything you need. If you can, visit this place weeknights, because it’s extremely packed on the weekend.",Neutral
316,"This was a great place to shop! We visited on a Sunday afternoon. Plenty of tourist friendly stores. Traditional and touristy gifts, food and candy. Definitely a must-do when visiting Seoul.",Positive
317,"We were in Seoul overnight and wanted to shop for their wonderful Korean beauty products. We stayed at a hotel near Incheon and debated whether to take the AREX Incheon Airport Express train from the airport or uber. The one way train ticket was definitely cheaper at 9,000 South Korean won compared to the $75 USD uber but we opted for the uber due to time constraints. Taking the shuttle back to the airport, finding the express train, and coordinating the train schedule plus a transfer to Myeongdong Street from Seoul Station seemed too much of a hassle and time consuming. Travel time was between 45-60 minutes. Be prepared for the crowds since this was one of the main shopping/tourist streets. The stores accept credit cards but have SK won for the street vendors. We found ATMs in the area. We tried some of the street food but after awhile tired of the greasy fried food. There were some rather unique concoctions: fish shaped waffles, dumplings with red bean paste, and seasoned chicken/rice cakes to name a few. We were there for the beauty products and found Innisfree to have the best selections. We loved: Jeju orchid enriched cream, green tea seed serum, green tea seed eye cream, volcanic pore clay masks, wrinkle cream and of course the masks. The jellyfish vital mask was one of my favorites. Credit cards were accepted plus duty free was an option with a passport. These products can be ordered online but was cheaper in the stores. What was interesting about this area was that there were literally no garbage cans to throw away wrappers etc. from the street food. Fun experience and felt very safe in the area.",Positive
318,The street comes alive at night and better when the weather is a bit cooler. Much nicer than nigjt market in Taiwan.,Positive
319,Fantastic place for people who love to shop. All kind of shops with many cheap things. Lots of street food as well. Love it! Never leave Seoul without going to Myeongdong,Positive
320,Great choices of appetising street food. Good crowd also creates a festive atmosphere. Seems very safe place to go with family. Some very good restaurant as well at very reasonable prices. Definitely an area not to miss when visiting Seoul. I stayed a week in Seoul and been there almost every evening.,Positive
321,"It is a perfect place for shopping of skin care, fashion items, etc. etc. Lots of people no matter it is weekend or weekday.",Positive
322,"Wow! You have to visit Myeongdong- the shops here are amazing- lots of beauty shops in particular! “Free” face masks are offered to lure you into shops but sometimes you can just take them and keep walking. It is super crowded here so be aware you will be bumped into n jostled a bit- all part of the experience! By about 4pm the street food carts come out- oh my goodness the variety, the look n smell is delicious! Is there anything fried that is not tasty?? No!! Try the crepes with Nutella, banana n cornflakes- yum! Egg rolls, corn dogs, fried chicken- all sooo good!",Positive
323,"The street was packed with so many shops selling cosmetics at a good price. You can shop them for souvenirs, eat the street food.",Positive
324,"A must visit if you want to do some shopping and have street food! If you know you way around, Namdaemun Market, Myeongdong Cathedral, Bank of Korea Museum and various shopping malls are nearby - although Hoehyeon station maybe closer to Namdaemun market. You have to try kalguksu and mandu dumplings at Myeongdong Kyoja! They have 2 of 3 locations in Myeongdong, but best go to the original place (established 1966?)",Positive
325,"Very busy, huge Korean and Western stores everywhere with amazing deals. We picked up a lot of awesome clothes and makeup for superb prices. Can strongly recommend.",Positive
326,"This is the place you have to visit if you are in Seoul. I went here almost every day whilst I was in Korea (for two weeks). There is so much here for everyone, in terms of beauty, music, niknaks, food etc. I would 100% recommend going here at night for the market, it is a once in a lifetime experience. The two best things I found in Myeongdong were - Nanta Theatre and Underground shopping centre.  The Nanta theatre was absolutely hilarious and can be loved by people of all ages. The underground shopping centre - found when going into the myeongdong subway station, was okay, there wasnt much there other than niknaks and socks, but there are a few kpop album shops there with such a large range of albums, all for very cheap. I'm from the UK and albums here (mainly bought through amazon) cost 4/5 times more than what I found here. I spent over £1000 on albums whilst here, and actually got my moneys worth, wheras in the UK this would have gotten me 30 albums at the most.",Positive
327,Very interesting place to wonder around. So many shops and side streets full of shops. So many Korean beauty products and also Tom’s flavoured Almond shops. Also there is also a big Art box here as well. It gets busy during the day but that is nothing compared to nighttime when all the street food vendors come out. Please be careful because people will just push and shove when it’s really busy. That being said we still loved the place. Go and enjoy all it has to offer.,Positive
328,"Myeongdong shopping street has all the beauty goods you need to find, every brand , every product. The freebies that comes with every purchase is also quite generous. Watch out for periodic value 1+1 buys if you intend to stay few days.",Positive
329,There’s no shortage of Korean beauty products here. However if you’re looking for just about anything else chances are you’ll find it here. There’s also lots of food choices available.,Positive
330,Shopping street is interesting and fun for everyone . Ladies are the happiness because we get to buy fashionable items .,Positive
331,"Myeongdong is chock-full of shops selling most things, but for me it is a place for beauty products and girly nic-nacs...and street food.  Towards the evening time the area fills with folk selling all kinds of Korean food...BBQ, stir frys, snacky bits and dumplings. I love love love the food and ambience here.",Positive
332,"This Myeongdong Street seems never ending road. Before our legs breaks from sores, there are still lots more and more to walk. Filled with many nearby shopping centres and of course street food. It’s very Yummy and walking down the streets during winter is superb cooling for us! In fact, it’s quite freezing. Will definitely come back here again!",Positive
333,"Night street of famous Myeongdong Street Night Foods, famous for its nightlife packs with people around. Had the lobsters baked cheese with read bean and Chocolate pancake that is so delicious and tasty. Is a night so lively not to be missed, environment and atmosphere is always so lively with bursting energy everywhere ☺️☺️☺️☺️.  Had teh lovely dinner over three street of night stalls around the Myeongdong Street walk. Lots of things to see and hang around the area.",Positive
334,"As part of our tour itinerary, we visited the Myeongdong street for a couple of hours. There is a Lotte duty free mall nearby as well, though its more for branded goods. The Myeongdong street was packed with locals and tourists alike. Most of the shops are selling cosmetics, face masks, fashion accessories, and many streetside stalls with local food.",Positive
335,"Interesting area with quite a number of cute places , shops , restaurants and night market . I prefer this area over Gangnam area which is to large and takes too long time to walk. Recomendable for tourists.",Positive
336,Located just along the train station. This place boasts a lot of fashion shopping and food( both street food and restaurants). Really a haven for the foodies even in winter.,Neutral
337,"My first impression was cosmetics...cosmetics and lotsa cosmetics although i did see a uniqlo store down the road.. Honestly i didnt go into any of the cosmetics store who offered free masks (only if you go into the store). I ve had my share of experiences where you go in and it would take me all my might to just get out and continue elsewhere. I just walked past and it was a wonderful experience of sights, smell, hustle and bustle of everyone around. You can get lost in here lol",Positive
338,"Myeongdong Street is super tourist friendly; there are many shops, cafes, restaurants as well as lots of street food and shopping. Most places have English speakers and/or menus, so it is easy to find what you want. This is also cosmetics center, so if you like or want any of those products: this is a place to get it! Don't be afraid to walk around some before you make final decisions on purchases because there are many vendors providing the same foods/products/souvenirs.",Positive
339,"Perfect place for first timer. U get food and u get shopping. This is the place to shop for beauty products. Night market starts at about 4pm where vendors start setting up, buzzling till 11.30pm. very convenient with Myeongdong station and euljiro 1(San) station nearby.",Positive
340,"Street is full of shops selling cosmetics. Sellers will try to lure you into their shops by offering you free mask. In the evening, there will be lots and lots of vendors selling street food. Price of food in this area are generally more expensive than other places like Hongdae, Ehwa Woman’s Univ and Namdaemun Market. Streets are usually packed even on weekdays.  Am giving it a 3 star because i am not into cosmetics and i think the prices are a more expensive too. I think this place is overrated, though i must say there are some pretty good eateries around eg Migabon (portion is smaller than Bon Juk but i found it nicer than Bon Juk) Myeongdong Kyoja (their dumplings are superb) and Yoogane Chicken Galbi. Apart from cosmetics, there are of course other shops/ mart selling other korean food eg almonds, potato chips etc",Positive
341,"Really enjoyed the food street and all. The place is huge. Some food street is not cheap, prawn is 10000 won. So tasty. Corn is 2000 won only. Enjoyed walking and managed to find good cheap shopping. Masks are really worth it!",Positive
342,"Plenty of stuff to buy especially souveniers. My kids bought loads of socks😊 for themselves as well as for friends. Fila stores are almost everywhere and the shoes are a bargain. Vendors start to setup their carts only around 3pm onwards so will be better to go there after 3pm to soak in the ambience. Hard to find rubbish bin so keep all your trash before disposing them properly. Train station is nearby as well, so will be a good experience to take the public transport. Plenty of cosmetics shops and a good place to buy snacks home as souveniers because it is cheapest here.",Positive
343,2nd time here and I really love it here; bustling and full of energy.  Bought so much stuff here; really went crazy with the shopping 🤤,Positive
344,"Surprisingly, of all the places that I have been to that are famous for street food such as Taiwan and Thailand, I actually like Seoul. I guess the only drawback for Seoul is that the street food is quite expensive and not exactly value for money. However, taste wise I really loved Seoul street food. They have all sorts of delicious food from cheesy lobster go soufflé with strawberries.",Positive
345,"I loved the food street there. If you want to find Korean original Cosmetic you better going to Young Lottee shopping(DutyFree). The difference shopping etude product between Shaila duty free and MeyngDong is the number of things (package)and expired date ( pls check). Of Course the duty free is long than Myeongdong. The price can be diference betwen 3000 idr per item. Its all up to your decision.  I think 2.5 hours is not enough for first shopper like me. In the winter session, (-3 C) you must wear appropiate custom, since this is an outside area. And do not take more than 15 minute in the outside. visit a shop every 15 minute is the best to maintain your stamina.  There are alot of the same shop, so be careful if you make an appointment. be more specific on the location.  Take Care and have Fun.. happy shopping...  Korea have a lot type of Cosmetic, pls brows and learn first about the product that you are looking for before it. its save your time.  The Food there is amazing. I tried grill Lobster with Mozarela, expensive but worthed. Eggbread is safe for muslim. ignore the fried ""type"". Korean street Seller are friendly but good sales person(They wont give up until you buy :).)",Positive

Try to go in the evening, there are lots of eateries and a very long food street with lots of choices. Food street is not that cheap though, it can cost you KRW 15,000-20,000 per person if you try 4 or 5 types of food.",Neutral
350,"The family loved Myeongdong that we came back more than 4x during our two weeks stay in Seoul. It is different when going in daytime and nighttime.  It is more lively at night with street food vendors putting up in front of the shops selling shoes, beauty products, clothes etc.  Be careful as it is crowded and packed with people.",Positive

353,"Wife and I only had two days in South Korea, so we had to be very selective in the things we wanted to see/do. Tripadvisor pointed me to this destination so we decided to give it a shot. I honestly cannot tell you how much I ate that night, but I can tell you it was a near endless supply of food for hours.  The stalls on the streets are just knockoffs, but somewhat entertaining to look at and the brick and mortar's offer a wide variety of items to purchase (cosmetics, shoes, dollar stores, etc)  If you only have a few days in South Korea, I recommend stopping by and filling your stomach for a few hours. Bring a lot of Won!",Positive
354,"I stayed 4 nights in Myeongdong. If you are into beauty n skincare, this place is for you. Lots of masks, toiletries and skincare on sale. As for street food, it’s rather pricey, and sometimes prices vary from stall to stall. A stick of fish cake can cost krw 1000 to krw 4000. I tried grilled scallop which cost krw 10000. The shell was huge but contained very little meat, swimming in cheese. I felt I was eating cheese alone.  The cheese hotdog was nice but you need to ignore the colour of oil used to fry it. Dark brown oil- recycled many times. Common sight at stalls that sell deep fried food.  Stalls sell more or less the same type of food. Always ask for the price first.",Positive
355,"Amazing energy in this city. The crowd just continues to bustle up to 11pm with street food vendors and ‘face mask pushers’ in a backdrop of visual stimulus of bright neon lights and aesthetic display of modern shops.  Great exposure and almost like a smorgasbord of Korean food in bite size quantity peppered at every corner. I would highly recommend trying the street food, it could certainly be good enough to make a meal out of it!",Positive
356,"My husband and I love shopping and this is a must! There is quite a verity of shops here, lots of cosmetics. If you enjoy shopping and people watching this is the place for you!",Positive
357,"Lots of brands here. There are deals to be found, but it's more like a pretty high end outdoor mall. There is a soup and dumpling place here that rocked my socks though.",Positive
358,"Quite a shoppers delight mostly for young women. This shopping area features are Korean skin care and cosmetics products. Many of the cosmetic shops offer samples in addition to 50% or more discount for purchases if bought in quantity. You can also have duty free purchases over a certain amount spent. It is also a great area for fashion clothing,shoes and accessories. In the evening this area has so much neon signage that it is almost blinding. As in any shopping area in Seoul there is a great quantity of food stalls and also different cafes and eateries. Quite a challenge trying to maneuver amongst the throngs of shoppers.",Positive
359,Beauty shops are in every corner. After buying their products they will give you free facial mask (10pcs) or their new launch make-up. Street foods have the same pricing. So accessible to MTR.,Positive
360,"Stayed right at the beginning of Myeongdong shopping street. Street have a wide variety of Korean speciality Street food. Having hot fish cake in a soup cup is unbelievable on a freezing cold winter night. The strawberries are superb as well. Since the street caters primarily to tourists, prices are on a slightly high side. Lots of stores selling beauty products at decent prices. Avoid the restaurants though, the prices are high and quality not to the standard where you can find elsewhere.",Positive
361,"Best place to buy cosmetic products, shoes & clothes. Offers variety of street foods. Unfortunately all are not HALAL for muslim travellers. Good place to hang out.",Positive
362,It is the same night market every where. There are normal goods. A lot of Masks and skin care are sole there. Natural Publish is good quality and popular in Korea. You must try fried lobster in street. It is fresh and nice. Beef steak is nice too.,Positive
363,"Crowded everyday and it has so many skin care shop especially face sheet mask and one time a salesman tried to trick me with giving me a sheet mask for free but when i want to get it, they try to pull me inside their store 🤦🏻‍♀️😀",Positive
364,"Went here in the midst of winter, in the rain at -6 degrees. Despite the weather, the place was crowded with tourists trying all sorts of street food from cheesy baked scallops to cream puffs. In addition, one can try all sorts of beauty products and cosmetics which is cheaper than other outlets. Just have to be wary of hustlers who will try to persuade you to buy as many of their products as possible and will even reward you with a free luggage bag in you buy in bulk. A good place to shop and eat and enjoy the atmosphere.",Positive
365,"Loved the shopping around here. Everything we wanted for our girls trip. Can’t believe how active it is around the clock everyday of the week. Sales people in the street trying to get us into their stores was a little annoying which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. Great food, products and access to surrounding neighborhoods in Seoul.",Positive
366,"Shopping, eating, sightseeing...it's all here. Almost all kinds of shops can be found here. The street food especially at night really made our trip memorable, it was sooo good! You can see different kinds of people walking around, fun to walk around here.",Positive

369,"Visited for the second time after a span of 4 years. Still lots of thing to see, street food, shops malls, etc... Now malls re all decorated with Christmas lightings. Make sure u don't miss the street food.",Positive
370,"During the day this is a street of cosmetics and young fashion, interesting enough and with plenty of restaurants of all Korean varieties with a couple of western ones as well. A labyrinthine network of little streets with shops and restaurants for all tastes. But in the evening it becomes a delight of impromptu stalls making and selling all sorts of Korean delicacies, fruit and drinks. Even some stalls selling costume jewelry and cosmetics. On a cold winter's evening when I was there, plenty of warming snacks and drinks. Not to be missed.",Positive
371,"Sure, you can go during the day but at night this place truly comes alive, especially on weekends. About 3 blocks square, the food stalls congregate along one strip and it is on this strip that we spent most of our time as we are foodies. From live octopus to egg cake, fruit smoothies to scallops in large seashells, the choices are endless and a veritable taste sensation. Prices are reasonable to a tad pricey for what you get but where else can you have so much selection in such a condensed space.  We also had a Korean massage for a reasonable price but it is a dry massage through towels and a hospital-like gown; more of a pressure point session than a true massage... a bit of a disappointment.  The stores offer packaged almonds, dragon's beard candy, ice cream, face and beauty products, and numerous tourist trinkets. But really, it is all the neon and energy and liveliness in the crowds that make this place work. An hour will do or stay the whole evening; it's totally up to you. Also, as it is downtown it is walkable from anywhere in the tourist area and certainly a short walk to a bus or metro stop. Definitely go; one of our highlights. 5 stars.",Positive
372,Love the street food in this place. There are a lot of variety compared to some markets. Slightly pricey for the food but quite standard throughout the street I.e. no need to look for best price or haggle.  It was quite crowded on a weekday night (wednesday) up to 930pm when we left. So can imagine it to be worse during weekends. There are also a lot of bulk discounts for cosmetics.  Even though you are not into cosmetics. Can just drop by to eat or soak into the atmosphere!,Negative
373,I stay at the hotel at Myeongdong and had most of my meals here. Great Korean restaurant as well as street food. Hot food during the cold weather. Not to be missed.,Positive
374,"Great place to go shopping, easy to get too and lots of places to eat if you are hungry I would suggest a week day if possible as weekends are just too busy",Positive
375,Myeongdong supplies all my needs from yummy food to egg toasts to Tom's Farm flavoured almonds to skincare and makeup!!!  Highly recommended to stay in the Myeongdong area as u can stroll through the night market each night after u are done touring tourist attractions in the day!,Positive
376,"Crowded as usual but a lot of shopping can be done here. For those looking to purchase korean snacks and smaller items/accessories, suggest to compare prices at each of the korean marts to get the best/most competitive prices",Positive
377,"Myeongdong is a great place to shop, eat and a place to meet up Korean friends. It is easy to locate and easy to reach. It is just two stops away from Seoul.  It has lots of facial, skin products, trend clothing and foods. It even has a gun range! You can try it for the first time. 14 years old and above. Valid passport and cash of course.  Here you no need for guide, just walk the walk... try not to go on weekends, tonnes of tourists and koreans.  There is self cert halal food!",Positive
378,A good place to shop! There are lots of stores to see from skincare to fashion. I recommend going to Music Korea if you're a K-Pop Fan since they sell albums at a cheaper price! Don't miss out on the food carts on the main street. You'll definitely miss it once you're home!!,Positive
379,"Soak it all in- the crowds, the street food vendors, retail vendors, noise, smells, etc. Try the spectrum of street food- you won’t regret it. Oh yes, if you get lost and don’t know where north or south is, look for the people wearing red (I think they are known as the Red Angels who are the Tourist Guides) and they will direct you! They also will provide you maps of this area because it is very easy to get lost. Now go and have fun!!",Positive
380,"Great place to spend an evening. Many shops with great deals of cosmetic product. At the end of the road there are some multi storey malls with amazing food ""delicatesen"" in the basement.",Positive
381,"Myeongdong is a must visit when in Seoul, no doubt about it. Not too far from some of the major sights and palaces of Seoul, this area is defined by its street food stalls and alleys full of branded shops. The streets are packed with tourists and locals alike, plenty of delicious food all over, whether in street stalls or in cafes and restaurants. Lots of beauty/cosmetic stores, fashion and the works. Just a great area to get lost in and absorb Seoul.",Positive
382,"A great beauty care shopping experience as you'll be spoiled wilth various brands- Tony Moly, Etude House, Face Shop, Laneige- just to name a few. Just in case you missed 1 outlet, worry not. As there are other Franchisees around.  Also there are alot of souvenir shops around.  If you like Almond Nuts, then this is the place you should head to. It's called Honey Bee Almond & Friends (HBAF). There are alot of varieties of Almond- Flavoured Nuts to choose from. Before you decide to buy any flavour(s), please feel free to try the samples provided. Comes in various packaging sizes. There are some sales happening right now.  Some of the highly recommended flavours are: 1) Laver Almond 2) Wasabi Almond 3) Black Sugar Milk Tea Almond (if you like Bubble Milk Tea drink. Similar taste) 4) Tiramisu Almond  Happy Almond-ing....",Positive
383,Had heard so much about this shopping area but what was on display went beyond all that. This is the place for korean beauty products. Lots and lots of street food joints and you will be spoilt for choices. The food looks visually appearing and everything we tried was yummy.

A must visit if you are in Seoul,Positive
384,"Paradise for a girls soul. Cosmetic haven and absolute delight for Korean street food. Everywhere you look, there are shops selling Korean brand cosmetics. Shopping and savoring sumptuous street foods is a walk in heaven. A must visit to stock up on your common and wierd Korean cosmetics",Positive
385,"Very festive place. All kinds of shops, plenty of restaurants, street foods, etc. It is always crowded. Definitely worth a visit when you are in Seoul. And if you need Won, those small currency exchange kiosks in Myeongdong have very favorable exchange rate, as long as you have 100 dollar bills. With 100 USD bill, you will get within 1% of the daily exchange rate. But with 50 dollar or smaller bills, they might ding you, could be 5% to 10% less of the exchange rate.",Positive
386,Interesting place if you're looking for cosmetics. Go for the street food as the restaurants here serve Korean food that's below par with a higher price. It's hard to bargain even with the stalls and mom-pop kind of retail outlets as I have the impression that they have fixed the prices.,Positive
387,This street is simply a good visit. There are all kinds of shops from stalls to big departmental stores and prices vary accordingly. It has great street food especially at night and it’s a good place to interact with everyday Koreans. It’s worth a visit,Positive

391,"Lively, vibrant, busy, bustling, this a great area for shopping, to eat a bite and feel the proper Seoul atmosphere",Positive
392,"Fun place to wander around at night and stock up on k-beauty supplies. Shop employees will be handing out “free” sheet masks in exchange for ushering you into the stores and trying to make a sale, so be prepared lol. This place gets packed after dark w/ tourists and locals alike. Tons of delicious restaurants and street food to choose from, so come hungry.",Positive
393,Good place to spend an hour. Go after dark when the street food vendors have set up and the stores are still open. A bit touristy but good fun nonetheless.,Positive

399,This is a must do if you visit Seoul! The street food is fantastic. It however gets really crowded and you see the same cosmetic shops scattered all over the place.

Overall is a good place to visit as there are multiple options and there is a subway station nearby too.",Positive
402,"First night in Seoul, we head over after dinner not knowing what to expect. We used an undercrossing, and as soon as you started back up the stairs, the smell of cooking food was like a beacon. Lining both sides and in the center of the streets were random booths, selling everything from pop sockets to fish pancakes. Was definitly a great experience walking up and down and seeing all the different vendors, and all the stores behind still open as well",Positive
403,"I really2 like Myeongdong because I can visit it in night time and it still so full of people... If you looking for cosmetic, this is the place that you should visit. For muslim, there are food stal that has halal logo (even the chicken), just search the halal logo in the stall You can access the shopping district from myeongdong station and walk to euljiro4(sa)-ga (even though the areas near euljiro4(sa)-ga not to crowded. Along with the route you can find cheap cloth store (check out the basement of the store to pay and more goods)",Positive

408,Myeongdong reminded us of Harajuku - it's filled with street food vendors and little shops (mostly clothing and skin care/cosmetics). Great for people watching or getting amongst the throng and wandering around a bit!,Positive
409,"Must try the street food even some are repeatings. For the street clothes stall, we noticed that they are not putting any price tag. I guess if you are tourist, they will just quote you higher price. Please be alert and aware. Of course, the cosmetics is alot and many brands to choose and great offer for masks. During the trips to Seoul, I never purchase any mask even they are in cheap price. Because I have seen alot mask promo, they actually put the mask at outside the store during day time under the sun. Choose those store with tax free and with promo. Plan to go there at least 2-3 days so that you can see which store offering lower price for the same items.",Positive
410,"This is a must do when in Seoul; the street food and whole area comes alive especially at nighttime. Indulge and enjoy... from hearty dishes to dessert, there is something to everyone’s taste. It’s packed with people but generally easy to navigate. Shopping is an added bonus here!",Positive

Street food probably a bit expensive relatively compared to the restaurant options. Many shops, a lot of tourists, and a bit difficult to move around as there were so many people. Mostly selling cosmetics. Have never seen so many face masks in my life!",Negative
417,"The first thing we saw stepping out of the taxi is the KoreaMart. We then proceeded to shop for unique Korean snacks, Maxim coffee, chocopie, all kinds of face masks, as pasalubong.

Some goods are sold with a very good price and recommended to buy during sales and reduction session.,Positive

431,"The place was swarming with tourists and locals alike, but the dizzying scene was compensated by the delicious street foods and a plethora of shopping options. Then again, food prices were too pricy. Anyway, if you're in for your first experience in Seoul, this area should be one of your first destinations!  Also, there is a tourist information center just near Myeongdong Catheral where you can ask for directions of money exchange shops, luggage coin lockers and the like. The guides directing us were really friendly and willing to help.",Positive

(It looked like special store), it costs W6,300 each. I picked few bags with different flavours and paid. Once I stepped out and walked to the next shop which offered buy one , get one free. Another similar experience was happened in Namdaemun market, I bought 2 packs of stainless steel chopsticks at W5,000 each, at the next shop ( just 3 steps away), it costed W10,000 for 3 packs. This experience told me that I need to compare prices in different shops before I make final decision to buy.",Positive

445,"When I think of Korea, I think of 2 main things: face products and yummy food! The Myeongdong Night Market helped to kill 2 birds with 1 stone. First off, this market is crowded and very lively. There booths set up on the streets selling food, clothes, and souvenirs. The food was amazing! The 2 main things I would recommend are the Roast Lobster with Cheese and the egg bread. Both were really great. The streets are also lined with some of the most popular Korean skincare brands, including my personal favorite “Holika Holika”. Overall, if you’re wanting to eat some yummy food while sfocking up on face products, I would highly recommend shopping!",Positive
446,"If you want to shop, eat, drink or just watch the hectic Seoul world stroll by then this is the place for you. There is so much activity, lights, people but it is all safe and interesting. A highlight was the Korean Fried Chicken and beer - I am not a shopper.",Positive

448,Highly recommend those who are interested in shopping (clothing/cosmetics) to stay in the area. The street comes alive at night when the food vendors push out their carts. Avoid the overly westernized foods as they are pricey and not very tasty. For those purchasing face masks/beauty make sure you shop around the same product can vary as much as 50% from a different store. Dr Jart masks are a must buy.,Positive

It all smelled delicious even though I couldn't sample any of it because of food allergies. The shopping was just as extensive with both mainstream retailers everyone knows, to local stores, to carts with ""authentic"" goods. Lots of people during the evening, but grest for people watching. Most full service restaurants here are inside the buildings that line the streets on the second or third floors. Just a fun area to go and explore.",Positive

456,It is best for cosmetics specially the facial masks. The merchants are helpful and willing to give you samples and extra bonus if you buy some. Street foods are many variettes but so so but it is fun to try .,Positive
457,"Every major city in Asia has a shopping area and combined with food stalls. Seoul has one and this place is crazy, especially in the evening hours. While the shop keepers try to lure you in to buying cosmetics, streets are lined with food stalls from either side with plenty of options, reasonably priced and decent quality. If you are a vegetarian, you will have limited choice but to see the spectacle, you must visit",Negative
458,"If you the type of person who enjoy shopping then Myeongdong is the place for you. from cosmetics, shoes, t-shirt, souvenirs even food you can get in here. if you come in the afternoon, the area is not that packed with people but there's no street food but if you come in the evening there's a lot of people and of course the street is full of street food.",Negative
459,"It's a best street shop for food and drink and sweet ,, cofe The street have a shops and both they sell every thing You can spend 5 ,6 hours",Positive
460,"This is what we were looking for, an experience of sound, light, food, and aromas that assault your senses. As soon as we began our walk through the area we knew this was the real Seoul we has come to see. Crowded streets filled with pedestrians, flashing neon, and a cornucopia of food to sample and wares to buy. It is something to experience at night or at least early evening, things just get going at dusk. There are all sorts of stores to shop and food to eat, you decide what you want. We just enjoyed taking it all in and strolled the alleys and streets, people watching and observing. I do recommend the fried curly potato on a stick rolled in BBQ seasoning.",Positive
461,"I visited the night market and it was quite a pleasant walk, just looking at things. This place sells mainly skincare, clothes and street food. The variety of skin care brands and products is so wide but I did not buy anything. Mainly because I was not sure which ones are good and they all look the same to me. But if you are a big fan of Korean skin care, this may be a place to visit. Street food is nice but not fantastic. My overall experience is good. The place is vibrant and busy, the weather was cool and comfortable when I was there. I am not really a night market person but I really enjoyed my walk, looking at things and people.",Positive
462,"Visited at night when the shopping street becomes a night market after a plethora of booths, almost all selling street food, are set up in the middle of the road.  Because the streets containing the market are wide, there is plenty of room to walk comfortably, without claustrophobia, having to push or being pushed. This gives Myeongdong night market an advantage over every other night market I’ve visited in Asia.  A further plus is the amazing variety of foodstuffs offered. As opposed to other similar markets in Asia you don’t have three, four, or ten merchants offering exactly the same food.  For those who like street food and/or night markets Myeongdong night market is very highly recommended.",Positive
463,"My daughter and I stayed at a hotel right in the center of Myeongdong and proved to be the most convenient! If you are looking for anything For skin care.... this is absolutely the place. Do your research about Korean beauty products, there are a million brands ... it is quite overwhelming .... store after store offer beauty products. Also there are lots of clothing stores, restaurants, coffee shops and much much more. The stores close a little later at night so its a very fun street to walk day or night. On Sundays, all the street food and bargain stalls set up in the middle of the streets making it much more fun even... it was nice to walk around the take a taste of the different kinds of street food. This street is a must see when in Seoul .",Positive
464,"Been to Seoul countless times, and feel that this is probably still the best shopping place for tourists, especially ladies. It’s practically ladies’ heaven... lots of beauty shops, and fashion shops. Love the street food during the evenings. No matter how many times I’ve been to Seoul, this is still a must go destination whenever I’m there.",Positive
465,"With expectations set pretty high after watching loads of Youtube videos on this neighborhood, I was understandably left feeling 'eh' about it after getting a chance to experience this for a few days.  First off, I loved the vibe of the neighborhood, despite how crowded it became every night. That said, the neighborhood actually is not that big - two main thoroughfares, primarily, each maybe 4-5 blocks long. Lots of side streets with other shops and food options, but the main action really is on the thoroughfares. Lots of cosmetic shops, lots of cheap clothing of the Forever 21 quality level.  The street food was very much hit or miss, nothing completely mind blowing. Lots of repeat stands, but note that not all the stands have the same quality. I tried to use the length of the lines for each as a rough gauge on how good the stand may be - also a hit or miss approach.  Two tips and heads up (literally): - there are a lot of hidden eateries, cafes, and shops in all the buildings above ground level. really pay attention and look up to see what you may be missing out on! I found a few cafes that I loved - grab a coffee and a window seat and you can people watch all the action down below for awhile - garbage cans are really hard to come by. stay with the vendor you purchase food from and chuck your garbage with them after you're done, or come prepared",Positive
466,"We went down several times in the evening. Street food is very diverse and even finer. The atmosphere is inimitable, real Korea!",Neutral
467,"One can basically shop till they drop as there are countless of shops selling cosmetics, clothes, souvenirs, etc. There are also many restaurants and cafes in the area.  The street vendors will start setting up their stalls from about late morning and finishes late at night. Many of these vendors sell street food as well as other stuffs, so the area is a great spot to try Korean street food.  Do bear in mind that in the evening and night, this place is packed. Also, we found some street vendors are selling some souvenirs at much higher prices than in Namdaemun market.  Overall, it is a great spot for shopping and getting food, whether it is restaurant or street food.",Positive
468,"I ate here most nights. Great location to just stroll and eat. Can get crowded, but that is also part of the charm. Must visit when in Seoul.",Positive
469,Lots of shops and stalls selling everything. I spent the whole might walking around and tried most street food.,Neutral
470,"Otherwise known as cosmetic street, I found it very busy and expensive, compared to other places. I also believed I got more samples of cosmetic when I brought stuff in other areas of Seoul. Also restaurants in the are are expensive, and feels a bit like tourist rip off central.",Positive
471,"This street is full of life! If you are into shopping for food, facial products and clothing, it’s full of those options. At night, it comes alive with endless stalls. The night market has some of the best local foods. The fresh watermelon juice, cheese corndogs, potatoes on a stick covered in powdered cheese, octopus balls and more, are a few I’d highly recommend.",Positive
472,"It's a wide shopping area which includes a ""night"" market. Very colorful, clean, and you can find many interesting things to taste.",Positive
473,"They have 2 Market places, very similar, they have their history, But to crowded, if you do nit have anything to do go",Neutral
474,"Great place to buy local souvenirs, Korean cosmetics, bags/shirts etc and you can bargain! If you're lucky they even give you up to 20% disc.",Positive
475,"Lots of food and items to buy for yourself or souvenirs. I recommend you to buy almonds, cosmetics and clothes if you come here. Dont bother about the restaurants because you will want to try all the street food stalls. The food stalls is not good as Japanese or Taiwanese stalls but they are good nonetheless.",Negative
476,"Everything at hand - food, cosmetics, clothes, things you need and don't need. Very touristy but worth a visit if first time. Vibe is very foodie related! Enjoy ;)",Positive
477,"Myeongdong is a haven for Korean beauty products. The atmosphere was buzzing in this area. I only visited in the night time and there was an array of street food. One thing to note is that you'll see the same shops every 100-200 metres apart so if you're not looking for anything specific but are on a time crunch, I'd suggest visiting the bigger branches which should have everything. However if you're looking for specific Brands/products, you may have to visit different branches if brand/product isn't as popular. For example, I was looking for COSRX products which I found only to be available in certain branches of Olive Young.",Positive
478,There are numerous shops selling everything you can image. Enjoyed the sights and got some good deals on gifts to take home to family and friends.,Positive
479,A place to buy the lastest and most trendiest lines of cosmetic product. Great place to buy cosmetics souvenir for your love ones.,Positive
480,"We really liked the street food market there. We came there for snacks every day. The best thing were the stuffed puff paste fishes.  The other things you can buy there (Tshirts, handy covers, toys etc.) aren‘t high of quality but the market is worth an experience. Especially since there are good and known shops too.",Positive
481,"Many many shops, skin care stores, cat cafes, street food and more. Definitely recommend as a tourist experience.",Positive
482,"A lot of skincare shops along the shopping street, with lots of streetfoods to check out the place well and for you to shop.  Myeongdong is located at Line 4. Easy to find with Subway app and Rome2rio app locator.  My second time in Myeongdong street and its better to travel with your friends and family! But at your own risk since its very crowded and you might get lost. Be sure to know your meet up points in case you are lost.  Be careful also to the sales person who pulls you to buy their product. Be alert!",Positive
483,"Beauty products, clothings, bags, socks, snacks, street food, cafes, tea houses, everything you need is here. Be sure to have a list before going to this area because you might end up buying things you dont really need. Kpop stuffs are abundant. You can get a lot of samples if you buy from cosmetic shops and they usually give you another item free. Dont get lost by taking picture of the street where you enter so you can go back to that area in going to your place. Street food costs around 3,000-4000 kr won, cosmetics at 1000-75.000 kr won and clothing from 6000-15,000 won for cheapest range. Restos from 12,000-33,000 kr won, its a set meal usually good for 3-4 pax. You will really enjoy this place. A must visit for traveler. A lot of cheap accomodation in the area.",Positive
484,"Myeongdong Shopping District is a must-see if you're travelling to Seoul. I would recommend spending an entire evening walking around and exploing the area while tasting some street food! There is a big choice among typical stuff and very un-healthy desserts. As for shops and resturants there is a wide choice, almost everything is typical from Korea!",Positive
485,Shopping street bustling with tourists and locals alike. Worth a visit... or 2... street food was expensive and had nothing to shout about though,Positive
486,Cannot move on with the shops and boutiques.hahaHaha I feel good and happy there.will come again later ehh,Positive
487,"Skincare, cosmestics, stationeries, phone accessories as well as some trendy clothings. Most shops offer immediate tax refund, if not, you can try to locate kiosks to do so. You can save more if you buy in bulk with lots of free gifts offered. Tired of shopping? There are many casual eateries and even street food at night.",Positive
488,"H & M and other major brands. Why shop here for what you can get elsewhere? Go to Namdaemun or other ""local"" shopping district for better deals and better prices. Some street food inside, more on the main road outside.",Positive
489,"The whole area is very vibrant and crowded, with a mixture of street stalls, bargain shops and international brands. If you enjoy shopping for make up and clothes this is the place for you. There are plenty of restaurants but the street food is so good you can eat well on the go",Positive
490,Perfect place in Seoul to grab a bite and get your shopping done! Plenty of street food options and retail shops to choose from!,Positive
491,"So for sometime now I have been using various Korean beauty products. Needless to say when I finally booked my holiday to South Korea, I immediately did my research where to buy beauty products. The place to head to is Myeongdong district which contains a grid of streets brimming with shops selling beauty products. Seriously, I was in heaven.  I also found that if you spend over £30,000 won most of the shops would immediately deduct the tax free amount so no need to claim it separately. Take your passport with you.  Also, when you buy stuff from these shops most of them give you freebies ... I loved it. A must visit for anyone who is a beauty junkie like me.",Positive
492,"here is a place where you can buy make ups and tons of korean beauty products. they also have some restaus, pharmacies, groceries and street food. live the street food especially the fried banana and glazed strawberries",Positive
493,"Looking to stock up on beauty products, creams and everything you will ever need, this is the street to go.. They do deals for tourists like buy 10 get 10 free plus if you take your passport with you they will give you the vat back on it. You dont need to take your passport but it saves the lines once you get to the airport to claim your vat back",Positive
494,"Initially walked around at mid-day and it was deadsville. Lots of shops and restaurants that could be found in multiple other locations. Happened to come back in the early evening and was shocked by the amount of people walking around, the lights and the energy. Don’t regret going but still didn’t feel it was particularly special.",Positive
495,"very neat and organised shopping street, good stuffs ranging from cheap until branded. the attractive ones are line shop and art box. the place is also very instagrammable problem is quite hard to find that can show the direction in English, since the google maps doesn't help a lot in finding certain spots by walking. Still very interesting place to visit even more than 1 time during one visit. will try again to visit during night time with different ambiences of course. Since it would take a lot of walking, good shoes and nice weather/ season choosing would be important.",Positive
496,"The Myeongdong marketplace is a large area offering a large variety of clothing, beauty products, and food vendors. It comes alive after 5:00 PM with young people and tourists converging into the area. Of special note is the “Cookin’ Nanta” theatrical production located in the heart of Myeongdong. A definite “must see”. Also, if you like lobster, the bbq lobster tails with cheese are scrumptious. Numerous street vendors offer this delight.",Positive
497,Full of tourists and nice ambience for shopping. Good prices and a lot of varieties but a lot of fake goods so beware,Negative
498,"This is a long and small road that has formed a market. Inexpressible by the excitement of this market. This is a street market so it is very fun and too much items. If you are a food lover, this is the street with the most junk food, the price of food is not expensive, only about 10.000won. Besides, this is also a place selling many cosmetics and fashion clothes. From famous fashion brands to ordinary types. The neighboring countries in Asia also see this market as a precursor and create fashion trends for Asia. If you come to this market to shop, you should prepare personal trolleys because there are so many goods here, you will save health and spend more time to shop, enjoy delicious food.",Positive
499,We had no idea how much shopping plays in the lives of the Koreans. This area is like times Square in New York.,Positive
500,"Very interesting varied shopping area. Friendly, helpful and polite venders. Good bargains to be had. At night markets, street food very cheap and delicious. Fascinating to watch the stall holders prep and cook their food- very clean. Area well lit, easy walk, friendly atmosphere, Well worth a visit",Positive
501,"Fun, bustling area with plenty of places to shop , people watch and eat. Great Korean restaurants and street food options are plenty and delicious.",Positive
502,"We stay at nine tree Myeong-dong2 hotel ,about a block away from the shopping area Nice walk up the litter hill and you are there , after 4pm all the street food stall starting to come out and in no time at all every corner is fill with food stall , prepare to go there with an empty stomach, everything you can imagine it’s there , wow what a place to be I feel like a kid , wanting to try everything, because of so many different type of food we went there 3 night in a roll just to try as much as we can",Positive
503,"This is where to come to get the street food in Seoul - there is loads of it available in the evenings. There's also a lot of high street fashion brands, including the Korean affordable brand 8 seconds. Recommend visiting the Myeongdong cathedral at the same time.",Positive
504,Good to see just for the sake of knowing how it looks like in person. But it’s just like any other shopping destinations in asia with focus on beauty and skincare products. Although there are other selections too like clothes and shoes. Street food’s quite nice if you’re starving while shopping. That’s all there is to it.,Positive
505,"A busy areas of stalls down the main side streets of Myeongdong. There is a lot of tat stalls but within there is traditional korean stalls. The variety of food on offer is excellent but beware if stalls don't display a price - always ask first, as prone to overcharge tourists.",Positive
506,"Seoul is plenty of shopping centers, markets,.... but Myeongdong is the top:a jungle of shops, restaurants, bars, hotels,... that will meet your expectations. If shopping is a boring activity, acoording to me, avoid this place.",Negative
507,"This is definitely a great place to stop by. Even if you don't care for shopping too much, they have a lot of great street food options and it's just really cool to see and experience.  If you do love shopping, then this will be glorious. Maybe even to the point that it can get overwhelming. Not only do they have hundreds of shops in a bunch alleys, there are multiple (and I mean MULTIPLE) of the same shop. So, if you're looking for Etude House, you'll probably find 4+ of those. It can get confusing considering how many alleyways there are. Also, the stands will have some shopping too.  Overall, a great place but if you're wanting to shop I'd suggest dedicating at least a few hours. It's a lot to go through.",Positive
508,The most colorful area of Seoul. The paradise of cosmetics and fine coffee. People from all over the world are doing their shopping and at the same time tasting amazing local delicacies from street vendors. Don't be afraid to try them! The market starts from the Catholic Cathedral and reaches the Lotte department store.,Positive
509,"So much to see, so much to explore. The koreans are really good at their pitch sales. The attractive deals and the friendly sales people draw me back night after night to hunt down its bargain. Go in the night, weather is cooler in the evenings in June and the street foods are irresistible.",Positive
510,"If you have clothes or shoes to buy, look no further. You will go crazy at the number of ABC-Mart or fashion boutiques here. Shoes are really much cheaper in Korea! I wonder why that is so though. There are also many roadside stalls selling Korean street food, although there tend to be many shops of the same variety. I think the best experience is to grab any street food you like and munch on them while shopping. By the time you are done, you would be filled with food but empty in the wallet.",Neutral
511,Shopping street good also for street food: a lot of choices and a lot of restaurant around. You should find also what you are looking for. Nice place where to walk for your shopping.,Positive
512,"Our Myeongdong street experience is one part of our “fantastically memorable “ Seoul trip. This is a must see experience. We enjoyed the food vendors here and you’ll see how the place is well patronized by people of different culture. The vendors are so kind in receiving tourists who were there to join the fun!! It’s so exhilarating to be there even just to be a spectator😋 the place is easily reached by train, and there are so many things to do and of course buy!",Positive
513,It is very cozy and lovely the various handmade store.I'd like to highly recommend this store when you visit MyeongDong Street.  MyeongDong 6gil 2-1,Positive
514,It's hard to believe how busy this street is when the rest of Seoul is quiet. This street is a must-visit place. There are so many street foods to try and many restaurants are open late into the night. The best part of this street is the food. Don't miss it.,Positive
515,"Personally, i don’t really like this area but it has some shops i really like, like TopTen10 and Uniqlo. The street food is great though. I was surprised of all the cheap copies of e.g. Supreme that was on sale everywhere",Positive
516,"This a very busy area full of shops and small things to do like late night massage, food and drinks.",Positive
517,We really enjoyed our visit here even though there are a lot of shoppers going around for this is a famous place that you need to visit when in Korea. Since my daughter loves korean beauty n makeup products she really went crazy buying stuffs for it is much cheaper here. Their street food is good if you're not picky.,Positive
518,"If you never see what's night market, then this is the place. You can try all kinds of Korean street food. You can shopping at all kinds of shops. But, be careful if you have young children as they will get lost as it is very crowded during weekends.",Negative
519,"It's just not tired for coming here everyday!!! I love all the sports shop there just too many! I grab most item that is on sale. From face mask of all korean brand to try, make up, sports shoes, bags, ladies clothes, socks, korean snacks, whatever you need it's just here to get. Must try the street food, take a look at the cart stores selling clothes, jackets, korean small restaurant to dine, Cafes, too many aisle to walk just don't get lost or find the Nature Republic Green leaves at the tall wall if going back to the train subway :)",Positive
520,"Plenty of shops in this area of Seoul and they appear to stay open all night as well. Busy area with lots of local restaurants, street food and national and international chain stores selling mostly clothing, make up and other fashion products. Be prepared to be walking very slowly as it is likely that the crowds in this area will make it impossible to get anywhere fast. Not my kind of shopping area with all the international stores but a good place to visit anyway.",Positive
521,"Non-shoppers may want to stop by just to see the scene or grab some delicious street food. Myeong-Dong is super busy from about mid-morning until late at night. Really, there is something for everyone however, mostly geared toward those interested in shopping. Skin care products are all the rage and are all over the place here - from high end to bargain buys, there are clothes in all sizes, and more food options than you could imagine. Street foods (anything on a stick), the sweet and savory egg bread, my personal favorite Delimanjoo (pricy at exit 4 of the metro, they put on a bit of a show too), and higher end restaurants where you can sit for a nice meal. Go with patience and empty hands (i.e. - don't bring your luggage). Definitely not a 'local market' experience however, good for some gifts to send home and people watching.",Positive
522,"I really like Myeongdong night market. Its so alive and people of all ages come here, so it's not just tourists. Its a great place for street food and souvenir socks which retail at W10,000 for 11. I'd definitely cone back again.",Positive
523,Massive shopping area with side by side cosmetics and fashion stores making for easy price comparisons. And food stalls that come out at sunset make for a wonderful street food experience.,Positive
524,"Myeongdong shopping street was easy to access as it is near the subway station(exit 7). The shopping street has different things that you could buy such as souvenirs,branded shoes(fila,nike etc),bags and they even have street food that sells halal food which is easy for a muslim traveller like me. So you could grab street food whenever you are hungry while shopping😉 definitely recommend travellers to visit Myeongdong to shop❤️ The price is affordable for certain things as some of souvenirs is pricey but as you walk around you’ll find cheaper ones!!",Positive
525,"This shopping street was near our hotel so we made sure we checked it out. The streets were so long and we didn’t see where they end. You can find street food stalls here, Korean marts and souvenirs but omg if you are into Korean Beauty products this is the place!!! I was in heaven and bought so many masks 😄✌️Definitely worth visiting!!!",Positive
526,"This market was interesting,but I found Namdaemun fascinating.If I could only visit one of the two,it would be Namdaemun.",Neutral
527,"I loved this place. When we went, there was a huge market with food, crafts, souvenirs, cheap knock offs.. it was lively and smelled like good food the entire way.. great Korean scene. Lots of people, mix of tourists and locals. We had your children so it was difficult to get around with a stroller. Definitely would not recommend letting your kids walk around without at least holding your hand. If you're looking for a deal, it may not be the best place. Could find similar but cheaper stuff in Dongdaemun, especially on weekends.",Positive
528,You can never get enough of Myeongdong shopping street if you are a woman who likes yummy street food and make-up. All the Korean brands are there and the prices are cheaper than in my country.,Positive
529,"Skincare, cosmetics and so many other korean products you can find in this area. Prices are reasonable but it sure is cheaper than buying them from my country. So if youre into korean beauty products there's a line of shops that carry your favorite k- brand that you can choose. You can also buy many other things like korean snacks, souvenirs, cute things and a whole lot more.",Positive
530,"Crowded place. But good to come. Many halal street foods too... if you love skincare products, you should go to this place. I took taxi from hotel near Anguk Station, with just 4000 won... cheap enough.",Positive
531,The shopping street is a series of closed off roads where vendors sell local foods in the evening. Cosmetic shops and local grocery stores proliferate. Not sure if too many bargains can be found but it is a fun night out. Of course the obligatory massage places are also everywhere.,Positive
532,"Top area to go shopping. Really good street food as well !! All diff. brands there. Lots of shops for cloth, beauty products and other things. Reasonably priced.",Positive
533,"This was our stop before lunch. This shopping district was very not too crowded and we freely walked from vendors stalls to shops without any rush. Some of us were even braved enough to sample free coffee and teas. We purchased some of our first souvenirs and clothing in this shopping area. Prices were reasonable and you can bargain. We had limited time and were only able to explore one end of the shopping area before meeting with our guide for lunch. If I go back I would certainly add more time here. Again, impressively clean. I was too busy to remember to take pics.",Positive
534,"🎋♨️✈️ Myeongdong- A Cosmetic Paradise A cosmetic haven. One can buy, buy and then buy some more and then perhaps come another day to buy few more... and folks that is Myeongdong Market for you. It’s a cosmetic aficionado’s or enthusiast’s paradise.There is a vast potpourri or omnium gatherum of popular Korean cosmetic brands. You could choose or collect all from HOLIKA HOLIKA to Innisfree and Etude House to Tony Moly and MISSHA. The list is never ending. When you feel like taking a break you could pick a fruit glass or choose from an array of grills from the vendors in the middle of the road. Once replenished, you could start all over again. So shop till you drop.",Positive
535,Must to visit at least one of the shopping centers especially the night ones! Unique experience and not that known... its a great surprise while getting informed about the sight seeing of this wonderful city,Positive
536,A nice place to spend the evening with the street foods and shops opened until late night. For middle easterners the a halal restaurant Saffron Restaurant is just around the corner.,Positive
537,Amazing and almost overwhelming! So many vendors to choose from-all assortments of goods and food stalls. Packed at peak times but that is part of the experience! A must see in Seoul!,Positive
538,"In the evening the area becomes a bustling place, with music raging from each & every shop; food stalls, souvenirs, and clothes stalls line up the streets while the lights of commercials and adds placed on the buildings add the finishing touches on this lively & intense place",Positive
539,"Its full of shops, and it will be no enough for 1-2 hours. Mostly cosmetic and sports shop. We tried to the food street, however we notice they sell the food veryyy pricey as they know many tourist come to the area. As comparison, fish cake in usual street near hongdae is only krw 1000 but in myeongdong krw 2500, same for all street food, all over price.  If you get lost, there is always some person with red clothes who can give you direction to closest exit to subway or assist you to find the shop that you want. They usually stand in middle pf myeongdong.  Love to see around myeongdong but will not buy food from there again.",Positive
540,Found this place the first night we got in as it was only 20 min walk from hotel. They have a several street food to sample. Lots to see for a quick tour of the neighborhood  Had our first fried chicken and beer here,Neutral
541,"Skin care stores are all over and you will see their chains on the next block. So don't worry about finding one particular location. Some products irritated my skin and I don't have sensitive skin so test before you buy. We went on a Monday, after 4pm, you will see food stalls on the street. Must try the food!!! They have grilled seafood like lobster tails. There are also restaurants nearby, one inside a mall and they are good too. Underground shopping center for souvenirs is great - items are negotiable. If you need another luggage you can also get it here for all the stuff you buy. Right next to subway line 2 and 3 too.",Positive
542,I love Myeongdong street. This is heaven shopping paradise for me. All the sales person are friendly and warm smile. We love the street food too.,Positive
543,"At night, all the stores shine in neon. Every Korean cosmetics company has at least one store here. Also has the honey butter almonds shop. Many street food innovations that I haven't seen before. Not quite cheap, though.",Neutral
544,"Great place for an evening stroll. Plenty of interesting stall having a variety of street food and some very unique,loved the egg buns and grilled lobster",Positive
545,"Myeongdong shopping street and the accompanying underground shopping belt is full of surprises. Look out for the largest Uniqlo, and the “factory outlet” of the famed flavoured nut snacks... nuzzling and busy.  Maybe it’s me but the Underground shopping belt is strangely similar to platinum mall in Bkk....",Negative
546,"Myeongdong street is a shopping heaven, both for food, goods, and beauty products. It is clean and not rowdy, making it a safe place to roam around even at night. You have to try the street foods, they taste really yummy and cheaper than eating at a sit-down restaurant. You can have a good fill of delicious food just walking around while shopping. Beauty products are sold at stores left and right. You cannot go wrong as Korean beauty products are top of the line. It would be a mistake to come home without atleast buying one beauty product. As far as buying replicated goods on the street, it is not advisable to haggle down on the price as every vendor sells pretty much similar items in the same price. Don’t embarass yourself as they will just dismiss you or worse, you may end up being laughed at or given the dirty look.",Positive
547,"No matter how many times I go to Myeongdong shopping street, I never got tired of it. There are so many shops and people, just very happening place. Lots of nice stuff to buy, apparels, food. We went to the same cafe on 2 consecutive days and will go again if we visit the street in future. At around 4pm, the street vendors start setting up their stalls and the whole place just gets busier.  Highly recommend this place to Seoul visitors.",Positive
548,"If you want to shop this is the place. We only went for a browse, but you could find anything you needed here.",Neutral
549,We went one night during heavy heavy rains yet still found this open air market unbelievably active and crowded. Fun to look at all the interesting food being sold. Parking pretty impossible there.,Positive
550,"i’ve been to seoul several times but i still can’t resist returning to this place to shop every time, particularly for masks and cosmetics. yes, it’s touristy and crowded, and you will be solicited by shopkeepers on the street every now and then (i haven’t encountered anyone particularly aggressive or pushy so they’re easy to brush off), but i would still recommend going there to shop for beauty products as there is a wide variety and the prices are decent.",Positive
551,"Unless you visit at 10am between Mon-Thurs expect it to be a mad house. It’s always jam packed with people. As as westerner it has some of the best options for shopping in my opinion as it offers more stores and sizes that I’m familiar with. Also it has all the major local stores if interested in those. The street food is second to none in Korea! I would recommend everyone go at least twice, first time time to experience the crowds so when you return again you’re have an idea of what to expect and will be able to enjoy it a bit more.",Positive
552,A few connected streets suitable for walking and full of shops. Great for shopping clothes and beauty products. The street vendors selling food were all very delicious too.,Positive
553,"Lots of shops, market stalls and street food. Feels very safe (as does the whole of Seoul). Most shops accept cred and debit cards.",Positive
554,"especially great after sunset. colourful and impresive. Full of people in street. There are lots of small street. there are sample of fast-food on street mid-line. they are freshly prepare the food such as shrimps, pork rib, kebab, potato and local fast food and you can eat when walking.",Positive
555,Myeong-dong market ist so busy. You can buy a lot of stuff you dont really need but also try food you never tried befoe. Seoul has a lot of diffrent types of markets. Check it out !!,Neutral
556,"Actually this the second time here in Seoul, we stayed at royal hotel in the heart of Myeongdong, really this nice area , active day ,night, skin care , food,clothes ! You will enjoy while walking here, but August not good month to visit Seoul, so hot,rain also high humidity, choose another month to visit Seoul & enjoy. Regards",Positive
557,"Quite an experience + better if you are not set on buying stuff. Interesting street food. Well, since you WILL buy things, they are selling good-priced suitcases as well (Guess, why I know!)",Positive
558,I visited this place almost every night during my 8 days there in Seoul. Many beauty shops and restaurants options.,Positive
559,"The Myeongdong Shopping Street is actually for us a web of walkable streets that have great stores and food kiosks left and right - Innisfree, Forever21, The Face Shop, optical shops, souvenirs, food like the delicious skewered meats, prawns, ice cream, milk tea - everything! The theater is likewise in this area so you can spend the day here and forget about your worries. Even the shopper with a tight budget has a lot to bring home.",Positive
560,All the famous Korean skincare lines can be found here. So much cheaper buying here than buying them in the US. There are also clothing stores and typical name brand stores on the street. You can also find some really good street food stalls up and down here. There is a nice taxi stop outside the Metro area.,Positive
561,"Nice environment, variety, reasonable prices, good service and great food. Definitely will come back! I recommend this place!",Positive
562,"This is probably the best street if you want to have some shopping in the very city center of Seoul. There're lot of stores, bar, cafè and restaurants, but in my opinion the fashion stores are too commercial and nothing special, they don't represent a good picture of the Korean style. Besides prices are higher compared to the other stores and bar that you can find in the city. Very recommended to young people or to people who like this kind of commercial tourism!",Positive
563,This is a perfect area to spend your time. A lot of shops from street food to brand name products. Prices are also very competitive. There are also many restaurants that one is spoiled for choice.,Positive
564,"One of the best place where to go in the night. Is the paradise of korean street food, you can try whatever you want: everything seems delicious (but not exactly cheap) ! There are also many shops, especially beauty shops (as in all cities in Korea), even if they all sell the same things, less or more. Here you can buy sweaters or t-shirts at a cheap price! Unmissable!",Positive
565,"Here you can find whatever you want: any kinds of foods, souvenirs, cosmetics, toys and whatever other items you would like to bring from Korea at affordable prices. Majority of shops accept credit cards. Despite of crowds of people, no crime at all and very friendly atmosphere. Better time for visit is from 10 AM till 4 PM on working days.",Positive
566,"We were told that we could get a fast and simple meal from the street food trucks in the Myeongdong area...and mainly that it was SAFE to do so. The streets were mobbed with people of all ages, and the food options ranged from grilled lobster to things I couldn’t pronounce. We opted for the grilled shrimp, fried chicken, and some fruit. Not so easy to eat standing up and being jostled by the crowd, but it was worth the experience, which was so fun!",Positive
567,Has lots of street food stalls at night. You can try all types of korean food. Those who like cosmetics will live this place. Seoul is quite expensive though.,Positive
568,A lot more beauty / cosmetics shops. Affordable and tasty street food. Street food only during evening until late evening.,Positive
569,"The streets come alive early in the evening and afternoon on Sat. Plenty of food stuff to sample and shopping to one's heart contend. Very convenient to get to by subway or buses. Be prepared to do a lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes and clothes, unless you are planning on buying a new pair of shoes or clothing there.",Positive
570,"Crazy shopping district, particularly nice at night with all the lights on and the street food vendors.",Positive
571,"From make up, skin care, good food and hotels - eveything is right here. This street is very convenient if you want to do everythinf. Note that the streetfood here is more expensive than streetfood elsewhere but still good to try. Try the shrimp and the lobster with cheese.",Positive
572,"Lunchtime mid week, it’s hot and humid. The fans are buzzing and there are people all over the place.  The street has shops and it’s buzzing.  I note there are plenty of places to eat together with plenty of small independent shops. For me it was people watching.  I found a place for lunch and it was packed. Aircon was a plus and wifi.  A great place to wonder around.",Positive
573,"There's no doubt that Myeongdong has been so developed that it feels touristic and commercialized. Lots of visitors from all countries at any time of the day. Most interesting things to do here is to:  1. Shop 2. Shop some more 3. Shop till you drop  From cosmetics, Korean groceries, apparels, shoes, etc - you're bound to find something that would interest you. Along the way, there are some pretty good cafe and restaurants. For first timer's to Seoul, I'd recommend staying around this area.",Positive
574,It was very busy with lots of people but lots of good street food. There is an endless amount of shops to shop in. There is something here for everyone no matter your age. I enjoyed it a lot.,Positive
575,"My hotel was literally up the street from this place and boy did I go all 3 nights I was in Seoul. All the beauty products you may want or not want, they have. All the street foods you want to eat, they have. It’s busy, loud but thats the fun part of it. Visitors and locals in one place = organized chaos.",Positive

578,"They have all the ladies (and men's) beauty products. They also have cheap restaurants, outlet stores, and other shops. This place is massive and the layout is confusing but who cares! I'm loving it.",Positive
579,"Avoid this place - full of garbage trying to get tourists to buy beauty products. It is the same 5 stores repeated over and over again, all selling these packages of ""sheet masks"" for your face or your feet. They have ""foreigners only"" discounts, and try to give you a free sheet mask in an effort to draw you into their store (and if you walk 50 m there will be the exact same store with the exact same crap).  If you're afraid to adventure out in Seoul and need to have a meal with the tacky tourist board and translations, then you should enjoy this street a lot.",Positive
580,"This is an excellent market, which has a range of stall selling a variety of food, from kebabs, dumplings, pancakes to tempra shrimps and Gimbi. At night the market gets very busy.",Positive
581,"Myeongdong is good for shopping and for food. It is less crowded during the week. On weekends and at night, it's packed.",Positive
582,"Myeongdong houses many different beauty brands close to our heart such as Mamonde, Innisfree, Laneige, Etude House, Tony Moly and a lot more! It is indeed the best place for a day of shopping for beauty products. They have many restaurants and eateries and even street food as well, so you will not have to worry of having to walk far to find a food outlet after your shopping. The famous Myeongdong Kyoza is located here!",Positive
583,"If you are in Seoul, head to this place for some shopping. It's basically a street shopping market. You can bargain too and that's depend upon your ability how well you can do so. One can get a few souvenirs from here.",Positive
584,"Street food is not always cheap and in this case, definitely not cheap. We had dinner before coming down the street and were happy to browse the shops instead. There are plenty of choices of food and shops and you can easily spend a couple of hours roaming here.",Positive
585,I thought this was a really cool spot to check out the shopping and try out some of the street food.  Tried the potato swirl on a stick and lobster with cheese. Pretty good!  It’s definitely busy but worth a visit for anyone that’s in the area.,Positive
586,"Lots to see and do, jam packed with shops selling facial products and clothes, lined with street stalls selling local fare. Full of life, definitely worth a visit (even if you don’t shop like me) to soak up the local culture.",Positive
587,"I’m not fond of crowds and crazy shoppers; so Myeongdong’s beauty shopping mecca doesn’t really spell paradise for me. The only thing that draws me back would be its hardworking purveyors who spend their nights feeding hungry bellies, no matter the weather.  It’s important to note that Myeongdong’s street food are darn expensive. It’s something that definitely won’t fall under cheap eats; as you’ll usually be able to eat a hearty meal in a sit-down restaurant for the price of one or two of these street food finds.  There will never be a shortage of options in Myeongdong Night Market. The tricky part is though is how to strategize what to choose, given that you usually have to allot for queuing time and work with a limited budget and stomach. The Roast Lobster with Cheese (KRW 15000), for example, is an insanely indulgent treat, which serves grilled juicy lobster topped with a fluffy melted cheese blanket. It’s delicious, but it definitely won’t fill you up.  Baked seafood served with hot gooey melted cheese seems to be a popular trend (given that we arrived at the tail-end of its winter season), as kiosks of Cheese Butter Baked Scallops also drew in their own lines. The scallops were humongous; but tended to be overcooked.  The Shrimp King’s Grilled Shrimp (KRW6000) may be an uninspired choice compared to its flashier neighbors; but its perfectly cooked juicy shrimps were addicting. Its sweetness guarantees the freshness of the shrimps and makes them perfectly delicious to eat on their own. They do give you a variety of sauces and dips to play around with though!",Positive
588,Great place just to wonder around and get lost while shopping. These streets are lined with many shops and cafes. Don't go too early as a lot of places don't open until afternoon. And note that most restaurants close around 8 or 9 but you can find a few open 24hrs,Positive
589,"During our stay in Seoul we visited myeongdong everyday before we went back to our hotel. myeongdong is very good if you like kpop as the underground market has all the CD’s and other merch for very good prices. If you aren’t into kpop the street itself has all the best clothes shops, skincare and other little stalls dotted around from etude house to forever 21. I highly recommend people visit this street at least once on their trip to Seoul! (Also you must get a twisted potato, it was so yummy)",Positive
590,"Bombarded with masks shops and endless food shops. The night market sells stuff on skewers mostly 4000-5000 won. Too tempting as they smell good. Desserts like ice cream including rose ice cream, cat cafe and witch cafe. Just need to be careful as after spending 30,000 alone won still hungry as they are just tiny stuff",Positive
591,"Best street for food and shopping, u will find alot of delicious food in the street which u can grape and eat while u r shopping. Such as shrimps, fish icecream, lobster, egg sandwich... and alot more. This street is full of beauty shops. Mostly makeup and face masks.",Positive
592,It'll take hours if one were to stop at every stall. The varieties of things sold ...very eye-catching. Tried quite a number of types of food. The lobster with cheese...very delicious but priced a bit stiff at ₩16 per piece. The Taiyaki there is different from the soft ones normally eaten. Its...crispy/flaky. There are quite a few stalls with the 'Halal' logo but some are like photocopied( not original). So not sure if its authentic. Surprising that quite a number of the stallholders can speak good Malay! Impressive indeed.,Positive
