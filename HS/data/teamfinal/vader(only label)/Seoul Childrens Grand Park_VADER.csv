279,Nice place,Positive
280,Very nice and huge park where you can always go for a walk or picnic. It's a rare place to enjoy real nature in Seoul too. Anyone would agree as it's always quite crowded all the time.,Positive
281,Perfect place to go with kids many rides and lots of space for play but you should go in the morning. It looks creepy and looks like an abandoned town at night,Positive
282,"Great place to let children run and play. Zoo is very depressing and deteriorating. I wouldn’t take kids to see the zoo. I saw many parents throwing stuff at the animals, and by all means, don’t let your children be unattended here I was holding my baby and two adults rushed to get a picture of a monkey, pushing me aside, and standing in front of my child. I’ll never forget it. The chimp was amazing, the adults were animals.The place is safe, but so crowded and old men and women will shove children.  The land is great, a piece of nature set in the city. Beautiful nature and weekdays are less crowded. Weekends from spring to fall are rough; religious groups and summer camps occupy most of the land, but there are quiet places if you search.  I’ve seen elderly men and women knocking squirrel nests out of trees to forage for acorns. Now there are signs informing people not to steal acorns. There’s annoying music playing all over the park, so you can’t escape Kpop even in nature.  The best thing about this place is the amphitheater. Great live performances. I highly recommend. But, sometimes there are very young girls (age 8-15) dressed like prostitutes twerking to Kpop on stage and it was SO awkward. .... especially as tons of old guys filmed it.... yeah, maybe grandparents, but I saw a lot of guys wandering by to film. Was so weird.  Convenience stores are here so you’ll have places to buy water or snacks.  There’s an ancient amusement park with rides that look like they’re from 1962, so ride at your own risk. I like the amusement park, but again, stay close to your kids and as always, prepare to be racially mocked, disrespected, or abused.  Enjoy this beautiful park. Avoid the morbid zoo.",Positive
283,"The park is attractive to both adults and children in autumn (late Oct./ early Nov.). The autumn colours are fascinating but they vary from year to year depending on weather, etc. This year, the summer is long and dry but the ginkgo and maple trees still show off their beautiful autumn colours, although not as good as those of last year. The park has a good zoo, apart from an amusement park, etc. I like to go there (and to the Seoul Grand Park) when I visit Seoul, as both are great places for photography and leisure.",Positive
284,"My 17 month old daughter was so extremely excited to see all the animals and did not want to leave. Korea has so many family-friendly places and this is definitely one of them. I think I may have seen some strollers to rent on our way in, not entirely sure. Overall, this was a lovely experience for both of us and we look forward to going back with my husband.",Positive
285,"We went with our 20month old toddler and really enjoyed the whole day there. It's a huge park with outdoor and indoor playground. Probably because we went on a weekday, the whole park was very quiet. Entrance to the main park is free, but certain attractions charge a fee. Key highlights 1) best thing about this place is the Seoul Children's Museum. There's an entrance fee but it's not expensive. They also allow u to exit and re-enter on the same day. There are 4 storeys catering to different children age groups and the set up on each floor is very impressive, especially the water play on level 3! I think it's fun for all kids from toddlers to teens. 2) catch the animal show called Anistory featuring many types of animals including seals, birds, cats, monkey etc. Need to pay for entry though. It's quite entertaining. Even though we didn't understand the language, we still enjoyed it very much. 3) the park is massive, great if u like outdoor walks. There's a huge water fountain show near the Seoul Children's Museum that's quite impressive too.  Overall a nice destination that offers both indoor and outdoor experiences. I didn't like the mini zoo though. Each enclosure was very small and the animals looked a bit depressed. I wouldn't recommend if your only objective is to visit the zoo.",Positive
286,"This place is a hidden gem and not many tourists visit this park. Very nice, clean and spacious park with lots to see like gardens, playground & mini-zoo. Kids would definitely love this place. The mini-zoo is a little sad as it's under-maintained and some animals look sad in their enclosures.  Plus point: Nice, clean and spacious park. Free entry except for the amusement park section. Not crowded!  Negative: Somewhat under-maintained. Has the potential to be much better",Positive
287,"We had a great time though it was so hot. You need to bring or buy lots of water. There are lots of places where you can find food/snack/ice water or other beverages. The kids loved the musical fountain, the water playground, the animals, the Anishow. We spent around 4 hours looking around and playing.",Positive
288,"Information found online about the Children’s Grand Park can sometimes be sketchy and inconsistent.  I hope that the following will provide a better picture for those planning to visit the park. I have also attached a picture of the park map that I will refer to below.  The park can be accessible by 2 subway stations.  The main gate (#1 on map) is accessible easily by the Children's Grand Park Station on Line 7.  There is a rear gate (#36 on map) that is accessible by the Achasan Station on Line 5.  The park has no entrance fee, except for the amusement park section.  My suggestion is that children below 14 yrs will appreciate the park.  I brought a tween son, and 2 pre-school kids to the park.  All three enjoyed the amusement park (#38 on map), which is closer to the rear gate. The amusement park had rides catering to pre-school kids to tweens. Do note there are some rides that have a 120cm height requirement. Rides such as the Viking, Dropzone and Roller coaster are generally adapted for tweens. For those a little younger, there are bumper cars and spinning saucers that are children friendly. However, this place would not be recommended for toddlers. A cafeteria is found within the amusement park serving traditional Korean foods and burgers. Nothing to shout about but it satisfies the tummy.  Amusement park entrance fees depends on the type of ticket you purchase. Tickets are available in single ride, 5 rides, 10 rides and unlimited rides options.  For the 5 ride option, kids paid 16,000 won. Adults paid 19,000 for the same ticket.  Toddlers and pre-school kids should check out the playground (#12 on map) with wet play and dry obstacle options. Bring your toys for sand play if you wish.  The other attraction we tried was the zoo – a mini zoo at that. We saw an elephant, snakes, birds and baboons. A couple of macaws looked like they were suffering from a disease that caused balding on their body. The kids enjoyed the zoo but soon lost interest in it once they stepped out of the zoo.  Next to the zoo is a pavilion which sells snacks (#34 on map) like ice-cream, corn dogs and cold drinks – a great respite from the heat.  2 attractions that we did not visit – the children’s museum (#46 on map) and Kid’s Auto Park (#44 on map) would probably suit school going kids.  Directions:  For the museum, and auto park, use the main gate.  For the amusement park, use the rear gate.  The zoo is in the middle of the park and are equidistant from either gates.  In summary, this park is accessible by 2 subway lines. It provides a place for kids to be themselves and preserves the sanity of parents who want kids to run wild and not bother them for too much over a couple of hours. School going children will probably benefit the most out of a half day excursion to this park.",Positive
289,"The park is quite far from where we stay at myeongdong and we paid 13,000KRW for the cab ride. The park is free and contains a zoo (where the animals look quite sad) and there is a little amusement park when you can pay for the rides. The main highlight for us is the Seoul Children's Museum located near the main entrance.",Positive
290,"Only covered a small part of it, as we were mostly busy with the museum, but what we saw was fun. A great big playground (with no shade though), big music fountain, a junk-made sculpture walk, a beautifully designed orangery... Lots to see!",Positive
291,"The park was pretty good, but even better was the FREE Zoo.  Lots of animals to see, had some gardens to visit, and has a large children's museum to visit.  There are also some walkways over ponds and sculptures to see as you walk around.  There was also food stops encase you needed something in a rush but I saw many people bringing in lunches.",Positive
292,"Excellent place to bring your kids with the free zoo and exhibits. Do spare time for the children's museum as well, plenty of the little ones to explore inside.",Positive
293,"Visited with my 14 month old while on holiday in Seoul. The Children’s Museum is fantastic and has a really nice toddler play area, the park is lovely and we had a pic nice in the grass and enjoyed the botanical garden and walking around. However it was really sad to see animals like a lion, elephant, leopard and tiger looking sad in small enclosures. Young children are equally happy seeing farm animals so I would have been perfectly happy just with the goats and ponys.",Positive
294,"Nice children's park mainly consisted of a zoo and an amusement park. We were surprised to see the admission is free. Also, wonderful place to enjoy flower blooming and fall foliage. - How to reach: It's accessible via both of Metro Line #7 Children's Grand Park and Line #5 Achasan. - Also good place for other ages as well as children. There are nice botanical garden, ponds, outdoor sports complex, too. - The zoo has many kinds of animals. Considering the admission is free, it's really satisfying. Feeding time will be fun even though we missed it. - There's a multi-storied pavilion. Unfortunately, it seemed unable to go up. - Attractions at the amusement park aren't free. The scale isn't that big.",Positive
295,"Visited when I did a trip around Seoul, there is many things to see in Seoul but I wanted to take our 7 year old grandson here",Neutral
296,"This is great piblic park for family, there are a lot of interesting spot like children museum (1,200 won), free kids zoo, music fountain, amusement park. You can take subway to children's grand park line 2/line 7 exit 4 or you yan take local bus No. 721 from city hall st.",Positive
297,"This park is huge and so beautiful during Autumn! We took lots of pic and enjoy ourself almost one whole day here! We went during Sunday and not crowded at all. Maybe during Nov most tree leaves already fall. But we still manage to snap photos with leaves on some trees :)  There is a convenient store near to the play ground where you can get some microwave warm food.  Zoo is free and interesting, my kids love it. But definitely not for animal lover. All animal in zoo I felt is sad and lifeless. The elephant seem like had a depression, sad.  Playground is big and fun!  We did not visit the children museum.",Positive
298,fun entertainment loads of activities for young ones please visit once to have a wonderful experience,Positive
299,"Last March I went there on a rainy day but the place was still beautiful, with cherry blossoms and tulips. Went there this time in early Nov. and the place was lit with autumn colors (maples and ginkgos). It was a sunny day. There were many children, mainly young students on school tours. Seoul children are so lucky, to have a lovely and huge playground with a zoo. For adults it is also great to spend some hours walking in the beautiful and tranquil park. The internal amusement park is located at a far corner hence it does not disturb those who love quietude. If you like children, this is a place to see them bursting out with joy and laughter.",Positive
300,"The park is huge. There are children’s museum, amusement park and also zoo. It was so nice walking with the kids and the roads are big to push the strollers. Alot of things to explore and the kids definitely enjoyed it.",Positive
301,"It's a huge park with probably everything in it - a park, a zoo, a playground, an amusement park, etc. You can easily spend half a day there on a day with nice weather. There are also strollers for rent with very reasonable price so there's no need to carry your own stroller in the subway all the way there. The zoo and amusement park may be small but perfect for our five-year-old. The foodcourt is not so bad. But it would also be nice to bring lunch and have a picnic in the park.",Positive
302,"We went to the Seoul Children’s Museum before heading down towards the park. It’s pretty well spaced out with a timed water fountain which leads to an open playground for kids, and towards a small-ish zoo. Great outdoor fun for the kids for free!",Positive
303,"First, do not visit on a Monday as the children museum will be closed. Easily reached via metro station, very big place that has playground, a mini zoo, amusement park. We visited the amusement park and believed due to weekday only 5 rides are opened and both my kids are shorter than 120cm, left omly 3 rides to play. You can purchase the rides in 1 ride, 5 rides or day pass. No sharing between kids. Rides that need parents accompanied need extra ticket at adult rate. But the staffs were extremely nice, especially the seniors staffs, they open up rides for my kids and even allow us to join them for free, I'm very very grateful and appreciate for such kind gesture. They have really make my day especially it was raining whole day in Seoul whereby my kids don't have the chance to play the sandy playground. We also catch an animal show despite we don't understand korean, it was very entertaining seeing the animals performing. In the park, you CN also see many elderly exercising, playing with their friends. The park is big and we did not manage to finish as it was raining on and off. But overall, so long you have kids, you should pay this park a visit, did I forget to say, entrance is free!",Positive
304,Visited Seoul Children's Grand Park during Summer and it was a great trip. Went there at about 4pm and there was the music fountain show. Walked around the area a bit before heading towards the zoo and it was already closed. Be sure to reach earlier if you intend to visit the zoo and the various museums there since they close pretty early.,Positive
305,"We brought the kids to Seoul Children's Museum and went around the Seoul Childrens Grand Park. The place was huge and there was a big zoo, botanical garden, amusement park and skate park. After a few hours of visiting the above places, we eventually made our way to the Children's museum. The museum is more suited for younger kids below 10, as our 11-year old found it a little boring. There were 3 levels in the museum and the kids had a lot of fun playing. The staff stamped out hands on the way in so that we could re-enter if we wanted to visit the cafe or restrooms. Overall the place is very clean and accessible, and I would recommend this to families with young children.",Positive
306,It was raining so there were not many people in the park. Early April was the cherry blossom time and the visit was quite worthwhile despite the difficulty of taking photos (with the lens getting wet every few seconds). The amusement park was not in operation in the rain for safety.,Positive
307,"This is the BEST, MOST AWESOME, CLEANEST, WELL-MAINTAIINED, museum for kids. My toddler 23months wnjoyed the toddlers area - crawling, climbing, sliding, and pretend house play. My 12 and 7 years old enjoyed the water play area, construction area, the wheel chair experience, digital art, and so much more. We stayed 10am to 4pm, and they still can't get enough. It was really a fun fun day.",Positive
308,"If you have kids, this is definitely a worthwhile place to go!  Can you imagine going to a park whereby one can do picnic, comes with a zoo and an amusement park? And thats not all... its FREE! (Free except the amusement park rides)  So, do include a day to this place in your itinerary! ✌️😉",Positive
309,"Zoo, botanical garden, rainbow fountain are free of charge. Amusement rides, animal show and children museum requires entrance fees. Springtime can see a lot of Cherry blossom flowers too. A good place to have picnic here.  Easy to spend half day here with family. Suggest to spend a full day with young children.",Positive
310,"There are so many things to do at Grand park. We went in winter, so spent most of our time in the children's museum. Amazing place to spend a few hours with a 3yr old and one year old. I think it would be good for anyone up to 6-7 years. Also, super-duper able. Maybe $10 for the whole family.  Lots of other great stuff in Grand park but most if the rest would be good in warm weather",Positive
311,"The park is huge with a bit of everything. The zoo is free and is a good size for small children to meet a few new species.  When I was there, there to be a show (not free) but since everything except the price was in Korean, I have no idea if I should go see the show or not.  If I only have a day or two I’d skip the park, but if you have time, the place is very relaxing.",Positive
312,"Huge park with play area, zoo, flower garden and science museum. It’s full day activity, all family members will enjoy. Must visit.",Positive
313,I have visited this place several times during my years in Seoul and had to get in one more before leaving. The questionable rides with their knockoff paintings are a trip to check out.,Negative
314,"Definitely a good place for kids to have fun, there is a theme park and a zoo in this place so it should fill up the whole day",Positive
315,Beautiful park that we were able to walk through to avoid the main road and all its noise. Really peaceful and lots of places to drink and snack. Plenty of toilet facilities as well.,Positive
316,"The children's museum was such an amazing place for kids. One could easily spend the whole day at the museum and the park. Be prepared to spend more than 3 hours here if you bring your kids to the museum because there's just so much activities for them to do. Ticket were very reasonably priced, which is a huge bonus point!",Positive
317,"The park itself was fine but we were so disturbed by the living conditions of the animals at the zoo that we did not enjoy the overall visit. The living spaces were incredibly small. Three zebras were kept in an area smaller than most backyards. It was very hot that day and we were saddened to see that few animals had areas to cool off in even a small pool of water. Most of the animals were pacing back and forth in their tiny living spaces, no doubt due to boredom. one of the fox seemed to have an eye infection. The elephant looked so sad and lonely. Some had little shade and no grass. This zoo would should reduce the number of animals and improve the condition of the animals by increasing living space and focusing on improved care.",Negative
318,"This Park has it all including a zoo, a children's museum, kid's auto park, amusement park with rides, playground, outdoor concert hall, Anistory where they have plays/musicals and the Music Fountain.We accessed this Park from the Seoul Children's Grand Park Subway Station exit #1.There are plenty of drink vending machines in the park and also a couple of small restaurants and canteens that sell food as well. We ate at the Fried Chicken Restaurant that's located right next to the Anistory.We spent about 20,000 krw for a family of 4. Plus there are bathrooms with baby changing stations located all throughout the park which was very convenient. If you go I would allocate at least 4 hours for this park but you could easily spend a whole day here.",Positive
319,"You can easily spend the day in this huge park. tons of things to view, to taste, to experience. A top notch place for kids. Strongly recommend.",Positive
320,"Like the name, Children's Grand Park, this place is suitable for kids and family. Many attractions to be seen, most of all are free. We spent 3.5 hours was not enough.... you even can spend a whole day here...... for day to night to explore whole area.  There are zoo, theme park, monkey bars, garden, many more...  We need to come back to explore more.  One thing that need to be improved is about food. Need more stands / small stores that provide foods such as in myengdong street food.",Positive
321,this place is near my home and i usually go there for a walk. this place is really nice. they have a zoo too their but it's not that big but enough to entertain you. it is also a good place to workout.,Positive
322,"After visiting Everland with its terrible queues i enjoyed Grand park for its quietness and free access. there is a decent zoo which is FREE! nice place to walk around, eat, sleep on the grass at sunny day. very good fountain with music show.",Positive
323,"An amazing children's museum for a range of ages. Went with two children aged 4 and 1.5 and both were enthralled by the mix of activities. Set aside several hours to go floor by floor through the activities including those focused on construction, space, farming, indoor maze, etc. Having visited similar museums in a half dozen countries, this is by far (and by a wide margin) the best.",Positive
324,"Its not a touristic must see destination, but a good spot to spend a day with young kids doing various activities...",Positive
325,"This is one of Seoul's best values for the family or anyone really. It's an old huge park that has many things to do for all types of people whether young or old. One of the highlights is the amusement park which is not huge but good for children up to high school kids. The rides aren't huge but big enough for kids to enjoy and you can purchase single ride tickets too.  There's a smallish zoo that kids would love. Also, there are a couple of playgrounds for kids to romp around in. If the weather is good, I would recommend taking a day or half a day and walking around.",Positive
326,"This large park in amongst the buildings is supposedly all about the kids. There is an amusement park with rides, a small zoo and theatre within the park. The zoo is horrendous. ...awful enclosures, the animals are lacking stimulation. I was mortified to see a vending machine selling food for the animals- people were encouraged to feed the animals. I saw some young adults throwing food at, not to, thr chimp and baboons. Awful behavior. The chimp enclosure is disgusting. ..the guinea pigs had a better home. Also the big cats and elephant have very small enclosures too. It broke my heart. Many exhibits were closed to prevent the spread of bird flu (so the signs said). Lots of old people meeting up for dating and walking group within the park. The botanical gardens within the park were awful too....totally indoors! Not really a garden, more like a green house. I was disappointed by my visit.",Negative
327,very open place to walk around and see Korean families. good place to take photos and get away from the city life.,Positive
328,"Fresh air with many small lovely corners, a place to visit when cone to Seoul,very close to Public transportation",Positive
329,"The place is big... if you have young children, walking from one end to another is a challenge.  2-3 playgrounds. One decent sized amusement park with a range of rides.  The children's museum is not expensive but is packed with 4 floors of displays and activities. It is similar to the children's museum in Ottawa. There is enough English signage on the displays.  We went in march so weather was still chilly and the foliage was bare. It would be so much better in spring/summer months!!",Positive
330,"Fun place to visit, especially if you have kids with you. Basically an all-in-one park. They have several zoos, playground (very large and themed too!), picnic areas, pools (if I am not mistaken, it was closed for maintenance when I was visiting), lots of gorgeous plants and trees. The area was well-taken care of. I felt like I was in a TV show hahaha. Awesome for kids as well. I saw lots of kids having fun by themselves there. Easy access to the subway. Close to Sejong University, where I was staying. Admission was free! I spent a good 2 hours just sightseeing. Great for solo wanderers who wants peace from bricks and skyscrapers. Also safe for female travelers. They even have background music along their alleys. Oddly creative, I must say.",Positive
331,"My 4 year old boy loved it, did not want to leave, and says he wants to fly 8 hours to go back there. Tomorrow.  So the rating I gave here refers purely to the Museum, and not to the park.  This Museum is a very interactive museum designed for young children, probably best for those between 4-7. Spread over 4 floors, to the kids, it will be 99% play and 1% learning. There are explanations in English as well as Korean, but I doubt if the kids are going to read these. Straight to the fun.  We had originally allocated one day to cover both the Children's Grand Park and the Seoul Children's Museum, which share a compound. During winter, half a day in the Park (free admission; pay for specific rides) is sufficient. But as mentioned earlier, half a day for the Museum -- at least to my kid -- was not enough.  To note, there is a small café on the ground floor near the entrance. But to really have a meal, the little mall across the road is probably more suitable.  There is an admission charge to enter this Museum.  For parents and older kids, there isn't much (else) to do.  One last point: this Museum can be accessed from the ""Children's Grand Park"" subway station.",Positive
332,"Among all the activities, the lighting works in the fountain with music is remarkable. After sunset, you must spent some time there to make your trip unforgettable.",Positive
333,"Very well done. This museum merits its own TripAdvisor listing as to not confuse it with the other children's museum in Seoul. Four floors of activities and all signs in English as well as Korean. My 6 year old and nearly 4 year old loved it. A bargain at USD12 (equivalent) for the three of us. About 10-15 minute walk from Line 5, Gunja station. Easy to find and most enjoyable. Three hours flew by - and my kids didn't want to leave. Very nice section in the basement level focused on building empathy - I was impressed with the inclusion of small wheelchairs and walking stick (for the blind) to be used along a small course.",Positive
334,"While this park is okay (nothing too special) the zoo area is totally depressing. It can be really hard to see the animals penned in such small enclosures. In Seoul, there are dozens of other parks and even a better zoo. I would really advise travelers to not go to this place. If you want amusement rides, you can find several other amusement parks in and around Seoul to visit that don't have such a sad portion to their park.",Positive
335,"We stayed nearby the park. I walked to Children's park almost every morning until I checked out to hotel. I couldn't believe my eyes that this park is really huge and grand! To me, it was amazing! I love this park on top of all parks. The feeling was good while walking (really long up and down walk) that you could actually explore many places in it.  There was a cafe that you could get a good souvenir and helped the children from the other side of the world. There was a massive grand orchestral open air hall that I sat there and listened to classical music (scheduled and not open as yet especially in Winter depending on the time schedule).  The breeze was so cool and warm sunshine. The other side has tin man park with all unusual shapes and sizes in forming different art piece for adults and kids. Wings chair, playground and hopping scale towards the dustbins (if you still have kids heart, you know what I'm talking about~ lol). You too can play as it said adults are allow to play. Please read the sign before playing and keep it tidy.  There is a mini zoo but closed during Winter (I was disappointed for not able to visit) and botanica garden. You might want to bring your kids or friends could visit during other season of time. On the other side, there was a huge theater and performance place that only opens at 10am (Korea Time) but I usually take my early walk and I skip this.  Lots of people walking and exercising in this park. You can go to a special training animal place and find out more when they open at 10am. A water park centre is also there too. By, now you will be thinking, are you serious? YES! I wish I could have more time for it! There are pagoda, some resting place, a bridge, many many sculptures and historical monuments, also a garden of nice flowers (Winter no longer can be seen).  Don't miss the Cafe as you can see coffee seed plant at other season. Music pieces too. I love arts, science and music with coffee and you would definitely see my reviews will be based on this.  It was a good experience staying in the neighborhood with nice landlady, good shoe seller (aunty who is dedicated) and lots of food surrounded. Easy to get your amenities at the convenience shops too!  Check this park out and I truly hope you will love it! Entrance is free!",Positive
336,"Seoul Children Grand Park is a good place to see Cherry Blossom on April. Crowd but the space is big enough for you to take a rest, eat some snacks, sit in the grass and enjoy the beautiful Cherry blossom! There is also a zoo inside the park!~ Recommend visit on April^^",Positive
337,We went during the MERS scare so it was quite empty. but my husband and teenage daughter had such an amazing time,Positive
338,"We traveled to Seoul with 2 young kids for 5 days and mainly focused on things to keep the young ones occupied with. The Children's park & the adjoining museum were fantastic. We ended up visiting it twice. The Grand Park on a sunday, had a carnival-like atmosphere with lots of stalls selling things, food vendors as well as play zones. The park offers up-close interaction with horses and a few other animals. The wild animal enclosures were well maintained and my kids had a great time viewing their occupants. We wrapped up our visit with a quick bite at a lovely little Italian restaurant just outside the Grand Park. Great way to spend time in Seoul!",Positive
339,"The entire park is a good place for kids to roam. There are at least two playgrounds where kids can use the facilities. We paid 500won for free play of traditional Korean games and also arcade games at the stage area (just near the entrance).  For the museum, it will be worthwhile to go in earlier so that your kids can have more time to explore all the stations. The driving centre was closed when we went there at about 3 pm on a Saturday.  There is a lack of restaurants around so it will be good to pre pack some food in case your kids are hungry. The only food place we can get is the small cafeteria at the museum.  Most of the zoo enclosures were closed or empty (probably due to winter and the bird flu season) so do not expect to see much from the zoo.",Positive
340,2nd largest park in seoul. Many activities and sights to enjoy all for free! For amusement park you gotta pay but i don't really recommend you. Others are mostly free and just clean and wonderful place to visit. Especially its real beauty on march to april due to flower season,Positive
341,"I currently live as an expat right beside the Children's Grand Park. I walk through it everyday. This park is huge (3 km around) as it used to be an 18 hole golf course. One reason to visit the park is just to sit, relax, enjoy the sites (zoo, gardens, amusement park, exercise stations are good to see too), but also, it's a great place to see how regular Seoul families enjoy their day off. The kids are adorable, the parents are attentive and the older crowd seem busy staying in shape. If you can catch a lawn bowling tournament or a badminton game, you're in for a full sight. In July and August you may want to bring bathers or a set of dry clothes for little kids as there's a great stream/water pond to play in near the centre of the park. And don't miss the flowers. The park gardeners have done an excellent job ensuring there's always something in bloom. Spring is especially pretty in cherry blossom season. Use Subway Line 7 for easy access (parking is a pain on the weekends).",Positive
342,"This park has lots of activities including a few playgrounds, different parks to walk through and play and a zoo which was free (!!) that had all the big African cats, tigers, bears, elephants, monkeys and more. The zoo enclosures allowed you to see the animals really close which was cool. There is also an amusement park, water play area, lots of shaded picnic areas and also a paid children's museum. Area is quite large and you can rent strollers at the park for us$3 a day which is good value. Food outlets also on sight. Worth a visit to entertain younger kids for a day. Minus 1 star as the location is a bit far from the city centre - about 30-45min taxi ride depending on traffic (costs about us$15 in orange taxi). There is a subway train station out front which may be potentially quicker. With it though given the large free play area and zoo for kids!",Positive
343,My child is six and wanted to spend most of his time at the amusement rides. However he was deemed too short to ride most even with an adult - and even the dodgems which was a surprise. So the rides were limited. We also tried to go to a part of the park where kids can drive little cars but it was all shut up and didn't look to be used much. We didn't get to the zoo part.,Positive
344,"We came as a family of 3 with our 3 year old daughter. We came here for the day. My review is very similar to others - there are several playgrounds, a water playground, lots of gorgeous paths to walk, an amusement park aimed at older children and adults, as well as numerous places to grab a snack or drink. It was easy to find as well. We took Line 7 to Children's Grand Park stop, then exit 1. Park is free of admission, unless your child wants to participate in the amusement area or ride an animal in the zoo. If you are looking for somewhere that your kids can just run and play out some energy after a lot of sight-seeing, this is the perfect place.",Positive
345,Nice place to go with your family. Nice food n fresh air. You can make a nice picnic with your family with fun.,Positive
346,"Prepare to spend a full day here. The grand park is next to the children's museum which is a separate attraction so you should plan to do both.  The grand park is meant for kids, and adults can enjoy the scenery with ample spaces and seats for picnics. There are several attractions within the park itself. We managed to only see the fountain at the entrance, three life sizes tayo buses, a sand playground with fun slides and swings, and parts of the zoo which is free. This is a great value for money attraction for visitors which is easily accessible by metro and surely enjoyable for children of all age groups.  A definite recommendation for first time family visitors to Seoul with young children.",Positive
347,"We had a great time here with my daughter. The park has many playgrounds, an amusement park, and a zoo. The amusement park you need to pay but it is reasonable prices and no line ups the day we went. The zoo is nice and it is free.",Positive
348,"We are foreigners living in Seoul and loved this gem. It's very easy to get to from line 4 on the subway. We came here to go to the zoo but we found much more here. There is a great place for small kids to play indoors but that can be pricey. I would avoid coming here on Jr sunny days though, the walking can be brutal.",Positive
349,"view here is so relaxing and helps me wonder how good koreans in terms of keeping their places clean, especially their water parts and grasses and more.",Positive
350,seoul childrens grand park. It is okey. Girl have a nice day. Zoo. Anistoty water garden and . . . All okey,Positive
351,"Our favorite stop on the trip if you have children. My daughter enjoyed everything, especially the water! Something for everyone and even if you don't feel like walking around, just sit if the fantastic place and let the kids run around. Well maintained, clean and facilitates we needed was easy to find.",Positive
352,"Has a zoo as well as activity area for kids - in summer its a great attraction (if its not raining) zoo display includes elephants, tiger and other members of the cat family (Puma, Panther, Leopard etc.) Activity area has a fee that need sot be paid if you want to take the rides etc.",Positive
353,Loved the free zoo! Animals are well kept and we saw different species of animals we couldn't see back home! Nice and big playground area for the kids. Can easily spend 2-3 hours there just spending time at the zoo and play areas and that's not even half of the park covered!,Positive
354,Good and fairly big park with zoo and playground. it is quite a good option to visit with kids especially during spring and summer time. there are enough foods outlets as well as toilets,Positive
355,"The place was huge. We didn't get through it all in the 4 hours we were there. The play areas we got to were nice. I wouldn't really advise the zoo though. We only made it to the monkey's and ""ferocious animal village"". Enclosures were small. Most animals did not have toys or things for their entertainment. The female lion was the only one and she looked so depressed. The elephant had nothing to play with and was alone. It just rocked back and fourth. The red foxes looked mangey and malnourished. A+ for the playgrounds. F for the ""zoo"". Free or not, no animal should be kept like that.",Positive
356,The kids have fun exploring the children mususem. Had a number of themes - so very informative as well. Highly recommended for kids.  The park also has many playground for the kids to burn off their energy !,Positive
357,"It's a great place. Lots of space and very green. Kids will love the mini zoo with tigers, lions, and others. Best of all, it's free!",Positive
358,"I'm not a vegan or some sort of animal hero, but this place made me want to dive off a cliff. I can't imagine how people rated this beyond Average. Maybe I could say it is average. They actually play terrible Kpop music through speakers as you're trying to walk through nature. They hate foreigners (personal experiences at least three times- take my word for it or kill yourself because I don't care) -- watched families scream and throw bubble gum at animals, watched Ahjumas stealing acorns when there were actual signs posted saying for humans not to steal the squirrel food (and then when I went to the bathroom there were acorns scattered around from being washed in the bathroom) --- oh yeah, the animals -- depressing display. Made me actually want to grab a sign and protest. Christ, maybe I'm becoming sensitive. Nope. this place was hell. AND, I'm a hunter, fisher, outdoorsman .... so, not your average HO complaining. Go here,,, just go here on a weekend and please don't kill yourself.",Negative
359,"Well what would say to a park that has well kept and safe playgrounds, plenty of greenspace and a zoo all for free? I say it's awesome and my children thought so too! We stayed at a hotel called ""The Classic 500 Pentaz"" which was within walking distance to the park. We found out about he park only by staying in the hotel and decided to give it a try. Glad we did as it was a pleasant day out with the family. I didn't have high expectations for a free park but this exceeded my expectations. the zoo was a nice touch. The zoo had a children's zoo area with barnyard type animals and then there was also the larger African animals as well. There is an amusement park within the park which we did not try since my children are too small but that area is at a cost which is to be expected.  One thing that was not so good was that there seemed to be many many children on school trip excursions to the park and while the small children were not a problem the older children (~15ish) were running amok on the smaller kids playgrounds which made looking after toddlers all the more important. Also the park is huge so plan how to return home before you go otherwise you'll have to backtrack to the entrance in which you came as we had to do.  If you're looking to burn a half day or so, don't hesitate to drop by this park you'll be pleasantly surprised.",Positive
360,"The park was great lots of families and things to do. The zoo was not huge but it is definitely the right size for kids. There is a lot to do at the park for free. We took the subway and carried our 2 year old, for ease of subway travel. We rented a stroller at the park for 3000 KW, it was a bargain. Great trip and park.",Positive
361,This park is designed as a kids atraction and has an amusement park section as well as ZOO and botanic sections. There is a small recyckled art pathway and a fountain which is synchronised with music. If you have some spare time it's a nice place but don't make it your Top 10,Positive
362,We brought our kids here on Children's Day which meant the park was absolutely packed. lot to do here. nice playgrounds for toddlers. is also great in the offseason when it is quieter.,Positive
363,Went there with a friend and had so much fun! It reminded me of my childhood and made me feel like a child again. This park is so big that even though i spend there whole day i still could see much more on my next visit.,Positive
364,"CY ( 2016.04.09 ) This park was established long time ago, so the facility was a little old. But this place was good to us because we have visited in childhood. There had amusement park, zoo, and picnic place. As compared with another big amusement park, there was small but free. On a fine day, there was very good place to walk in downtown. We visited for seeing cherry-blossom, that's great.",Positive
365,"I find this park not only a fun place for children, but also for adults. :)  I went here last April 3 and experienced the wonderful spring colors, especially the world's famous cherry blossoms that lined the sides of the park's pathways. There's a place for children's rides, a science museum, a mini zoo, and a flower museum (mini enclosed garden).",Positive
366,"best place for cherry blossoms in the spring, you'll see all the school children with their matching vests and backpacks with their teachers. it is the cutest thing! The petals from the cherry blossom trees will rain over you while you walk down the streets. but the free zoo is kind of depressing, poor animals.",Positive
367,"Best things about this park are that it's close to the city centre and so very easy to get to by the metro, and it's FREE!!!  We took line 5 on the metro which takes you to the back gate of the park, but it's still an impressive entrance gate. There were fountains by the entrance, and then more in the middle of the park which are what my daughter loved most (and she got drenched, so a change of clothing may have been a good idea). There are also several play areas, most of which are sandy, so appropriate beach-type footwear would have been better than the shoes she went in, but we'll know for next time  She didn't really like the zoo area much, and the animal enclosures did look quite small which I often think is quite sad for the animals, so I was quite glad she didn't want to spend too long in that part.  We went on a Friday afternoon and the park was quite busy with groups of school children. There were also quite a number of people who had taken picnics, and pop-up tents to shield themselves from the very bright sun (we weren't very well prepared as I thought it was going to be a cloudy day and hadn't expected it to be so hot).  We only went into 1 toilet block and ended up using the disabled toilet which had the type of toilet in that we're more used to - the toilets in the ladies were ""squat"" style, which I don't like and I knew would it would be disastrous to try to get my 5-year old to use one of them!!!!",Positive
368,"Love love love the park! Entrance fee is free, so many things to see and do for family, especially those with young kids. The park is super clean, as any other place in Korea, a bit cold in winter but there are so many things to explore. Our kids love the zoo, the playground especially with the snow sled hill. You need to pay to use the children play facilities but its a fair amount compare to the fun!",Positive
369,"This park is super fun for little ones. Entrance is free. The park is clean and well maintained. There are small playgrounds, a well kept zoo and an animal performance that can be seen at a small fee. I highly recommend this park to anyone with younger kids. It is large, so wear good walking shoes.",Positive
370,"We visited this place on the weekdays and we loved this place. If you have kids, definitely you have to bring your kids here. We visited the children museum and we could say the children museum was very good. Kids could learn a lot of things while playing there.",Positive
371,"There is a small zoo including sea animals, a greenhouse, landscaped walking paths all for free. And if you get hungry, you can stop by the cafe for hamburgers, curry rice, pasta, and coffee at the entrance of the zoo. We were a group of adult friends looking for a quiet relaxing way to have lunch and spend the afternoon. I was not disappointed because it was a pretty place for photographs. We went on 7 December 2015 and it was cold. I'm sure Spring or Summer or Fall season would be a perfect time to visit this place. The train station stop is the same name on the Green Line.",Positive
372,"Went on dec weekday. Animal ride was closed, amusement pak many rides were closed. Big Playground under maintenance,auto rides park for kids was closed also.  Kid was disaapointed as many activities look forward to couldnt be enjoyed. No notice of closure on website also.  The amusement park had many rides closed, so we werent sure if 25k won whole park unlimited rides ticket was worth it. Ended up only tried one ride.  Animal section for kids was good for them to get up close and personal with feeding goats.  Otherwise just enjoyed a leisurely stroll around the park.",Positive
373,"The grand park is both a park and a zoo rolled into one. The grounds are sprawling and you can take a nice leisurely walk while admiring well-kept greenery and an amazing zoo. And you don't need to pay a single cent!  The zoo section of the park is amazing. You can roam freely around the park with the animals at close proximity. You can feed the goats, ponies and other tamed animals. You can buy the feed from cute little vending machines at 1,000 won or bring your own lettuce, carrots and chopped apples. There were many animals to view and interesting sections like the children's zoo and animals school.  Just a walk away is the Seoul Children Museum which houses 4 storeys of interactive fun for kids at an entrance fee.  Food is affordable at the food courts all located conveniently In the vicinity.  I love this place and it's one of my favorites in Seoul.",Positive
374,"It is easy to get to by metro - about15000won from downtown by cab. Big open spaces cor children to run around, but enough for adults to look at too. Some small exhibitions- art and so on as well. Coffee stops of course. The zoo is worthwhile - all animals seemed to be looked after - a few showed signed of boredom. Easily a place for an afternoon in the sun...and close to downtown Seoul too.",Positive
375,One of my favourite hangout in Seoul because it's free and I am a kid at heart. There is a mini zoo that features many more animals that you would expect from a park. I usually visit with my friends when we just want to hangout but don't want to sit around and do nothing.  Not advised to visit on weekends cause it will be super crowded. Weekdays afternoons are the best.,Positive
376,"It was a great zoo, especially with kids. It was overcrowded when we were there, so we didn't stay longer than 3-4 hours. The park is BEAUTIFUL, especially in Fall-huge, well-maintained, with plenty of trails for walking between the animals. You'd have to come back more than once to see the whole place.",Positive
377,it can be difficult to find an ideal vacation destination that appeals to all family members. Children's grand park met all requirements of my 4-year-old overall.The area of the park is quite large needing definitely stroller for kids which is available for rental there.The main attractions is the zoo and amusement park.your kids have a fun there for sure!,Positive
378,"It's a park with zoo, botanical garden, amusement park, etc. I went to take a walk there and looked around. There are a lot of families with young children there. You can also see teens taking thrill rides at the amusement park. The admission is free but you have to pay to enjoy the rides. Overall, it was really nothing much.",Positive
379,"It amazes me to see any one or two-star reviews about this place. I guess you can't please everyone. However, I really enjoyed taking my girlfriend here. We were able to see some cherry blossoms, check out some animals, and walk through the botanical gardens. Despite it being a drizzly day, we had a great time. It's a wonderful place to have a picnic, take your family, or have a date. You can buy some snacks there or bring your own food. Maybe it's not an amazing park like you would see in London but I think it's a fun place and you don't have to pay anything to get in.",Positive
380,"Being from Melbourne that has some great urban spaces, I really love Korean parks, but this one didn't grab me. In its winter coat it looked drab and over run. The parrot enclosure was closed due to concerns about avian influenza, my kangaroo compatriot did not look good, I saw a zebra standing in sub zero temperatures and I did not dare see the Animal show. I had more fun watching people feed the animals with the packets of pellets available from the vending machine. Don't get me wrong, it's a free park, there is an amusement centre, and given the right day with kids you could have a great time, sadly it was not for me.",Positive
381,"Not a touristy place per se, but for family with young children, I highly recommend to visit.  The park is huge, really nice place to stroll around. They have lots of attractions but due to weather in winter, some are closed.  Particularly love the children's museum. One of the best museum i've been too and my boy enjoyed it so much. Very interactive and worry not, everything come with english translation.  Thing to note: bring your own lunch/food. The cafe sells ice cream n coffee only. Unless you want to walk further out near the zoo, there is an american style restaurant selling burger and pasta.",Positive
382,"Location is wonderful which is just a few minutes walks from subway. Amazingly, it is free of charge, large park, not much animals but definitely is good for kids to learn between different species. My family (with 2 little kids) spent half day over there and we liked it much.",Positive
383,"We got there and the animals were all in tiny enclosures with visable signs of distress. Most animals clearly looked unhealthy with fur missing, or visable infections. The animals had little or no water, was disgusting and we left.",Negative
384,Park was huge with some animals. It will be boring if you have visited places like Everland or Lotte World. Can dropby for 2hrs or so if you have young children.,Positive
385,"This park has some of animals and korean people mostly occupied rather than foreigners. Type of people were families and couples. Above all, the entry fee is FOC so it is good to look walk around when i am idle on weekends!",Positive
386,"We have enjoyed going around this park, it's huge and has a lot of variety from flowers, arts, music, zoo and surprised that we can ride a camel. It is definitely a great experience for me and my family.",Positive
387,I was impressed by this park is not just for children but for adults it's very interesting and I recommend,Positive
388,"No entrance fee, need to paid for the facilities in the amusement parks. Must go with kids if it's your first trip to Seoul. Can spend hald day easily in this park.",Positive
389,"It's free to enter this outstanding park with many option to enjoy it. It looks small at the entrance, but definitely huge inside.",Positive
390,"On a sunny day, if you want to go out for picnic, Seoul Children's Grand Park is the spot you can visit. The good thing is that there is no entrance fee! There are zoo, botanical garden, experience spaces like adventure land, gallery and more, and amusement park(should pay fees for using activities) inside. The amusement park is recently open after remodeling of 2 years. You will have a full day with joy.",Positive
391,"This park is located at the east of seoul city. It is a very big park which is great for everyone. As it is so spacious, children are encouraged to run, scoot or cycle. Light refreshment can be found near the entrance but it is advisable to bring along some light refreshment as you enjoy the grand park.",Positive
392,"If you want to see everything, then plan to stay the whole day there. Number 1 attraction inside the park is the children's museum, it is not actually a museum, it has interactive kids activities through which they may learn everything about many subjects including science, art & creation. Also, the park has got a dancing fountain, theme park and zoo.",Positive
393,"Doing too much touristy things for the adults in Seoul? Give your kids at least half a day here in the big outdoor playground, sand/dirt area, free zoo including camel and donkey rides, musical water fountain, etc.. You will find Korean families camping out with tents and picnic baskets. When it's windy, the dirt/sand does get picked up, so it is best to put a net on the stroller. Not advisable, however, to go on Children's Day, a National holiday in the beginning of May.",Positive
394,"A free zoo, animal feeding areas, big playground, cherry blossoms - what more can one ask for!  Would've also wanted to visit the Children's Museum but we didn't have enough time. In any case, why coop yourself up in a building with all the glorious spring sun shining down from heaven??",Positive
395,"They have two areas for snow sledging, and many other activities for kids. Well worth the entrance fee. If you can't make it to the ski resort, this is a good alternative for kids to 'play with snow'",Positive
396,the park is very big that children can spend whole day . there also some winter sport for children from dec to march. small zoo and children museum inside. there is an entry fees for the museum but we didnt visit because not enough time.,Neutral
397,"Now like any park area in Seoul its really busy and crowded on the weekends so if you get a chance to go mid-week that is my advice. They have all the same animals in the zoos and all the same attractions so if you want to be able to walk around and enjoy then avoid the weekends. The Zoo is pretty good, some animals i wish that they had more space to run around and a little cleaner place to live but they do have a good variety of wildlife. There is a nice botanical garden and the grounds are really kept well. This is a place to have a picnic.During the spring the cherry trees all blossom and its a really nice place to go but this place can be see year-round.. Enjoy cause its worth the trip and bring your sneakers cause there is alot of area to cover.",Positive
398,"If you would like to have an half-day outing with the kids, Children's Grand Park (excluding the amusement park) can be the choice. We took a subway from Hapjeong station to the Children Park station, exit 1. There was no entrance fee incurred. However, fee was charged for camel / pony riding, amusement park and character world. Upon entrance, we were greeted by the awesome autumn scenery with colorful orange, yellow and red leaves on the tall trees. The junk art caught our eyes along the way to the mini zoo. Due to limited time, we did not visit the water park and amusement park. The stage performance by some musicians halted my elder son from leaving the park ealier. It was an enjoyable trip for small kids.",Positive
399,Really nyc place especially for kids.. The entire walk in the zoo is also refreshing. The dolphin show n d rose garden r the highlights of this park. U ll get to see almost all the animals.. highly recommended for animal lovers. ..,Positive
400,"If you find Lotte World & Everland is too busy & crowded, suggest you to visit this place with your childredn, especially to see cherry blossom in April. Frankly speaking, I didn't expect there were so many cherry trees before visiting. The cherry blossom was very awesome and eye-catching. The most important was that this park was big enough to let the visitors to have enough space to walk around & appreciate this beautiful blossom. Have fun in this park.",Positive
401,"Date of Visit: 2013-09-21 My two young boys loved the park, from the Animals, Sculptures, Exhibits and the food. Unfortunately for us, the area where the carousel and rides were (as seen in the Gangnam Style music clip) were in a section that had been closed off and it was being redeveloped. However, that aside, it is well worth attending.",Positive
402,"It was very hot outside but our children wanted to have fun anyway. Plus! It was summer vocation time in Korea. So every attraction sight was crowded with millions of people. So this park was good, not too many people, they went into special fountain which was very fun and cool x. They had a nice zoo but the park is going to be much more exiting in 2014, when the restoration will be over.",Positive
403,"We went as a way to fill a spate day in the city. Yes it is free, but from Seoul station it's a long metro ride with many changes. We got there and the animals were all in tiny enclosures with visable signs of distress. Most animals clearly looked unhealthy with fur missing, sores on their skin or visable infections. The animals had little or no water, Was disgusting and we left. Armament park wasn't open. Give it a miss!",Negative
404,"The amusement center in the park is closed for renovation, should be closed for another 6 more months at least by the looks of it.  The kids play facilities are quite decently maintained considering its free.  Zoo have quite fair variety of animals on display.  Worth a visit if there is a spare slot in your time schedule.",Positive
405,"My niece was so excited when visiting this park. She could see, touch and play with animals in a huge space. There are some that she had never experienced, such as Camel Riding. It should be one of the most memorable in her childhood.",Positive
406,"From the subway station exit, the main entrance to this park is just a short walk away. Entrance is free. Even before entering the park, you will be immediately amazed by wonderful flowers on the way to its entrance gate. There were lots of school children when we went here but it did not feel crowded at all owing to the park's large space. The zoo was great. It had a lot of animals. The restaurants' food were ok and reasonably priced.",Positive
407,"This park has a lot to see and do. There is a zoo, amusement rides, and botanical gardens. There is also a children's museum on the grounds. It is definitely geared towards the younger kids but there is plenty to see and do for all ages~~",Positive
408,"It's a great place for people to go to relax but i would NOT!!! ever go their again because if you want to encorage animal crulty then by all means go i won't stop you but it breaks your heart to see great beautiful animals locked up in cages with not nearly enough room to run in. you'l see it in the wolves, the lions ect but what bugged me the most was that sad miserable look in the coyotes eyes and that makes you never want to go to a zoo again. so i didn't like it but other people might but don't go and do it for the animals.",Positive
409,"This is a free park in seoul..it is big..if you are with kids,this could be more than a half a day affair. there is one main food center within the park.this serves both Korean(udon,shrimp fried rice,pork tonkatsu,etc plus free side dish of pickled radish?)and western food(burgers,fries,fried chicken-9000won for half a chicken-10 minutes cooking time while we were there but worth the wait,16000won for a whole chicken).the pork tonkatsu was huge but the rice that came with it was just around 1/3 cup.lining outside the main food center were kiosks selling hotdogs,cheese filled bread,drinks,etc.everything was reasonably priced. This is a free park-free admittance to most areas-except the rides.there is a 'bungee jump' for kids for 5000won.other rides for 3000won, others for 4000won.there are camel and donkey rides-also for a fee.the free stuff were the children's zoo,polar bear,seals areas,playground areas.the big amusement park (near the end of the park)was closed the time we were there..last Sunday of march.but,we could see a lot of rides inside the park. Restrooms were clean and easy to find.kid strollers for rent right at the customer center near the entrance for 3000won.get maps before entering the park from the area where you can rent the strollers. This park is not like Disneyland nor is it near everland..but,it is for free.it is best to keep this in mind.it is a nice breather from cosmopolitan seoul especially if you have kids.you should approach this like you approach the areas near Han river..just as a break. Not a lot of tourists visit this place,this is mainly a place for the locals..so English is not widely understood.but,just do your best uncomplicated English plus actions..everyone's so helpful that it might not even matter. Not to be highly prioritized unless you have extra time on your hands.",Positive
410,"I have been to Everland and I paid so much for a family of 5 to play on the skip slope for my children. Its very rush to wake up in the morning and the tour bus will pick you up from the hotel and it takes about 1hr and 30mins to reach there and by 3pm they want you back on the bus to bring you to some other places to buy some ginseng. **Go to this place call the Children's Grand Park but it's actually the Zoo. There they have verything that Everland have and you can take your own sweet time going there by train on the Dark green line and stop at station 726. You will enjoyed and never regret going. Take the open air ""cable car"" up to the mountains. It's beautiful and many many more.  Jimmy Ng",Positive
411,"We stumbled across this place and was quite surprised! Its a great free, theme park/Zoo for both young and old. The monkeys were great, I did wonder about some of the enclosures being very small and other people have questioned it so I hope they do look after them well. Some parts of it were a bit runned down but its definately a great place to visit or walk through! They do put the animals away later in the day as we found out so keep in mind the closing times.  A Must visit if you are in the area. If you are in guesthouses nearby its a great day out without travelling too far!",Positive
412,"I must give it to Korea, they know how to make AWESOME children's parks. I can't say enough about how wonderful this park is! Amusement park, zoo, playgrounds, etc! The park is free, but some of the attractions cost, but it is worth it if you are trying to see the sights as well as please the children. Our son could have spent days at this park and never seen all the attractions. Although it's a long subway ride, it's totally worth it!",Positive
413,"This place is a perfect location to take your family for a day out. We found the grounds to be lovely to walk, and many places for children to play. The fact that it is free to get in is amazing! We planned on staying the day and riding the rides, however they were closed due to construction. We managed to still spend the entire day strolling thru the park. Very pleasant day for a stroll.  CAUTION: if you are an animal lover such as I am, then you will want to AVOID THE ANIMAL AREA!!!!! The cages as well below par, tiny, dirty and the animals have lost their will to live. They all look depressed an unhealthy. After spending a beautiful day at the park, this saddend me to see the welfare of these poor defenseless, helpless animals. I would not recommend the animal areas to anyone. I wish citizens of Seoul would take action for these animals!",Positive
414,"The Children's grand park is quite easy to find/access and the entry is free making it a suitable place for a nice stroll or activities with the family. Although some are a bit outdated, there's plenty of activities to do including theme park rides, zoo, botanical gardens, playgrounds and plenty of places to eat. The place is quite isolated in winter which can be both a plus and a minus",Positive
415,"A great place to relax and enjoy peace and happiness. The park makes you feel happy, and carefree. If you enjoy walking and viewing nature, this is a good place. It is conveniently located at a subway entrance, so easy to get to. I particularly enjoyed the walking paths, but the best thing was the water fountain dancing to the music. The music was super and the show was entertaining. Unfortunately, I didn't see the major attractions--zoo, etc. but the park is beautiful.",Positive
416,"free entry, good large theme park, easy to access.",Positive
417,"I liked that there is baby strollers for rent, very clean territory, nice zoo, camel riding for children.",Positive
418,"We visited this park in Seoul because it was free and we wanted to see the music fountain! To see the lit up fountain with sound effects was cool but there was so much more..people go there to do some dance as a group done by community workers i guess , my daughter joined in and had a great time. The zoo was a bit old but still enjoyable..there is some rides for kids as well!",Positive
419,"The Children's Grand park is grand! It is free to get in. There are tons of different themed areas, and the entire place is covered in huge trees, so it's a beautiful place just to walk through. There's an adventure land with lots of play structures, a zoo, botanical garden, pony, donkey and camel rides, an amusement park, a marine animal exhibit, an animal show, and many more. We ate at the botanical garden cafeteria. My son and I had pasta carbonara for 6000 won each and it was delicious. My husband had a burger which was actually two smaller patties side by side, I believe his was about 7000 won for the burger, fries and drink, he said it was good, but he was not as ecstatic over his meal as I was about mine. I was just happy that they had pasta which is one of the few things my 3 year old will eat. There were many family mart vendors around so finding a drink when you needed one was easy. The restrooms were very clean and always nearby. We went to the amusement park and opted for single ride tickets, 3000 won for each ride for our son, and 4000 won for each ride for us, we only rode a few rides. My husband and I took turns on the roller coaster which was really fun. And our son rode the kiddie truck ride and the carousel. You can also buy a combo ticket for 5 rides, I believe it was 12000 won for children and 15000 for adults. Or you could buy a ride all day bracelet which I believe was 20000 and 25000 for children and adults, but those prices may not be exact. Our most favorite part of the park was the polar bears in the marine exhibit, they swim right up to the glass and being that close to such a huge animal is amazing. Also, we really enjoyed the camel ride. I rode with our 3 year old son and it was 8000 for the two of us. Our son rode a donkey by himself for 3000 won, and a gentleman led the donkey around and held onto our son to be sure he stayed on. We also went to the animal show called Anistory. It is a cross between an animal show and the cinderella story. It was 8000 for each my husband and I, and our son was free. So it cost us 16000 won to see, and although it was entertaining I didn't feel that the show was worth that much. If you go to the Seoul Zoo you should see the dolphin show, very entertaining and only 2000 won per person. We only saw one souvenir shop but didn't find anything we wanted to buy. But altogether the experience was a fun one, and I would recommend it to anyone, even those without children :)",Positive
420,"Children Grand park can be really fun for the kids. There is always something to do or play. Ours are 4, 6 and 9years old and have always fun there. There is a little fun fare too and a nice playground. If you go there on weekdays when it is less crowed then the kids have fun.",Positive
